{"text":"Not really a place that I would go much. My kids hated it there; it was too loud and busy. I didn't feel too comfortable there. My hubs didn't like the chocolate milk that they served him. He said that he hates Beatrice Milk and it tastes like that brand. We had the salad; can't remember the name of it but it was cobb style salad. Nothing wow about it; it was good though. My steak was a bit overcooked to the point where it was dry and flavourless. Granted; I wanted it well done but not to the point where it's blacken. Not a place that I would love to go again due to the loudness and too many tvs everywhere you look and the feeling of crowded room. It made me feel very claustrophobia just being in there. It was hard for the waitresses to move around as well that I've noticed. The food isn't bad but the food doesn't rock out of this world either."}
{"text":"First time dining here.  Five of us went on a Sunday for dinner.  The first thing I noticed were all the TVs.  This place had more TVs than any other place I have been to.  It would be great for a big sports event.  The second thing I noticed were children.  Not sure if this is a common thing, but I was surprised to see large amounts of children here, and they even have special small plastic kids cups and cotton candy for them.  The service was a bit slow, but being a new restaurant it's to be expected.  The food was tasty typical bar food, and the many puns in the menu was amusing.  They also had a few problems keeping tables in order as the table beside us paid our bill by mistake and we ended up getting their bill."}
{"text":"This is now our go to place, but only if you can get a seat. They really need to open both floors on busy nights. I have seen so many customers walk out because they can't find a seat on the 1 floor that is open and packed. I bet they were so mad because they had to spend 20 minutes finding a parking stall, only to get in and not find a seat.   Being a new waitress/bartender, I cant complain about the slow service. It's hard when they understaff and you have to look after 20 tables and try to provide service to all those tables with equality. Until you are a waitress, you CAN NOT judge someone on their service. Unless there are 3 people in the whole place and it still takes 10 minutes for an acknowledgement."}
{"text":"2nd visit. Would prefer kid free all the time. But after 8 it is kid free.  Food is great, noise level for some might be too loud. But we came to watch hockey and expected noise. Our waitress was excellent and intuitive, will most definitely come back."}
{"text":"Time for and update because this time it was much better.  Let me start by saying \"THANK YOU\" for adding a decent addition to your white wine list. This was a major complaint for me on our last visit.  We ended up here with some out of town guests who had never been to the Brewhouse so they were pretty pumped with the 'Canadian' menu.   We got the perogies and steak bites to start that come with that steak sauce. Hello! The boys got burgers and they looked fantastic. Everything for our party came out as ordered.   Yet again, we had to ask them to turn on the hockey game instead of baseball or basketball. With that many tv's you would think they could have a little bit of everything going on and if there is a hockey game happening we wouldn't have to ask at all.  The Manager came around (as they always do) to make sure everything was ok and it was of great relief not to have any complaints this time!"}
{"text":"This is the third restaurant/bar to inhabit this building in the past few years. It seems that the building was born under a black cloud. The building itself is beautiful and large, and this area of the city desperately needs a place with a solid reputation for good food and good service. It would be a shame if yet another establishment bit the dust.  I'm not a fan of eating in bars, but in recent years it seems that Calgary has lost a lot of its casual, inexpensive and just plain 'good eats' restaurants. We've become a city where spending $30 - $50 a plate for dinner is accepted without batting an eye. That's fine on occasion, but sometimes I'd prefer that my entire bill be in the $30 - $50 range so when a coworker tried The Canadian Brewhouse, and raved about it, I thought I'd give it a whirl.  My husband and I went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. The restaurant is two floors, but the lower floor was closed with a sign directing us upstairs. At the top of the stairs, we were immediately greeted by a cheerful server who told us to sit where we wanted - either inside or outside on the deck. We stayed inside, and looked around to see what had changed. The most noticeable change was that the two floor wine tower that previously graced the middle of the building is now a giant column of TV screens. In fact, there is no shortage of TV screens in this place! Future Shop can't compete.  The menu is a multi-page extravaganza of sports bar fare: poutine, pizza, wings, burgers, soups, salads and sandwiches with some more upscale choices for dinner. It took a bit for us to decide what to have as there was also a mini menu offering breakfast/brunch fare. We decided to share an order of the Golden Garlic Fingers and the Montreal Smoked Meat Poutine (large). When the food came out, our eyes became as big as the plates our food came on! We could not believe the size of the portions, but sometimes big is just...well...big. We tasted, and the Golden Garlic Fingers were pure bliss (what's not to love about crispy golden garlic pizza crust with a light coating of cheese and bacon dipped in donair or meat sauce?). The poutine was also a treat. We ate half of both dishes, and were absolutely stuffed. We asked for the rest to be packaged, our request was promptly tended to, and when the takeout boxes were returned, they were accompanied by a complimentary serving of the Maple Crème Brûlée. Although I am neither a fan of maple nor of crème brûlée, it was very light and tasty.  The serving staff was very friendly and efficient. Since it just opened a few weeks ago, they had some of their Edmonton staff (it started there, and has opened a number of locations throughout Alberta) training the Calgary staff. It was fairly quiet when we were there, and is a large place so it will be interesting to see if the level of service we received will be maintained as it gets busier.  On the whole, we were very pleased with the food and the service. We'll definitely go back as there are a number of things we want to try. Here's hoping that the black cloud finally has a silver lining!"}
{"text":"the restaurant was dead inside & still the service was non existent & the food was some what edible, steak bites were rare but seasoned well, the hot wings sauce was interesting & not in a good way, Cesar salad was bland , and the bacon was raw yet burned on the jalapeños , not sure how that happens."}
{"text":"I've been there quite a few times since Canada Day weekend, maybe about 15+? Too much probably, but having a pub like this in this area was so needed. It has a really good atmosphere that saves you from line-ups and long drives.   My favourite part? If you have a ticket to the Stamps game, take the free bus that leaves 1 hr prior to kick-off. No \"must buy\" burger deals which is great, enjoy whatever you want then hop on the bus. They also do sell tickets if you don't have one yet.  It has been a great place to enjoy some post-golf caesers, post-football game beers, and quick bite to eat on the way home.  My only complaint has been some really poor service we got a few times sitting on the patio. Once they completely screwed up the poutine order (I know!!, not poutine!), forgot my food, no quality check, and they didnt offer us anything, not even a free drink. However, when the manager's are present the service is great. My steak came out raw not rare once and the manager had it perfected quickly.   Overall I really enjoy this place, and hopefully they have better luck than past tenants in that building.The food isn't fantastic, but it's decent for pub food, and better than some other norhwest pubs. The prices are fair, and there's always a deal on something to drink or eat."}
{"text":"Great place, great people, great food! Shitty beer selection mind you..."}
{"text":"We like it here. Good selection of drinks and the food is very decent.  Lots of TVs and great place to catch the game. They have good choice of daily specials and the atmosphere is typical of a busy sports bar."}
{"text":"Favorite bar in Calgary. Awesome beer selection  Great atmosphere Huge menu, full of amazing food Best specials  And Donair poutine, is one of my favorite poutines in Calgary"}
{"text":"There is lots of parking and the decor is welcoming and clean.  The menu is a riot. It made us all laugh out loud and become a topic of conversation. The service was OK. The server forgot little things like \"No ice in the drinks, please\".   We were a party of 5 and we ordered appys and meals. The food varied from stellar to mediocre. The steak bites were fantastic. The eggs benny left much to be desired.  We'd probably go back, just because there aren't too many other options for this kind of food in this neighbourhood, but this location seems to be jinxed. They change owners every few years. Wouldn't surprise me if this place does not last either."}
{"text":"Was here last Friday and we had a blast. It was packed (Flames Game) and to be honest at the beginning the service was pretty brutal, not sure if they were understaffed, but we were for sure waiting for drinks. Once it started to clear out there service picked up for sure. Food was okay as well.   The saving grace in a lot of this was the bar manager Mike. He really dedicated a lot of attention to us, checked in on us when he could and was extremely hospitable   The only thing I would suggest is really staffing up for that 7-10 shift.   Overall though, we had a great time (love the live twitter & facebook feed on the big screen, so much fun)"}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday July 29th. The place was hopping. It was so loud that it was impossible to hear anyone talk. Not our scene, but people seemed to be enjoying themselves so fair enough. A couple of us ordered nachos to share. On the menu the nachos purported to have a pound of cheese on them. What we got was mostly bare nachos with at the most a handful of shredded cheese on them. Pretty nervy to charge $17 for what was essentially a half a bag of chips with barely anything on them. Will not be going back. Too bad because the place is very local to us. I guess the establishment is putting all their funds into powering the dozens of TVs on the premises ....definately not on the food."}
{"text":"Poutine-inspired everything. It was the atmosphere you expect from a good sports bar (although every tv was showing the same game). The menu is huge- a little overwhelming, but they get extra points for having hilarious names for their dishes. We came in from the airport with a hungry party of 12. They took good care of us and everyone's food was pretty good."}
{"text":"A few friends and I decided to come here for dinner before we went to the movies (hooray for recliner theatre!). When we first arrived, the Canadian decor was definitely noticeable. The hockey stick railing and the mini Calgary Tower in one corner were a fun touch and worked well with the theme of this place. We found a nice spot and waited for someone to come by. We waited....and waited....and waited. Finally, our server came over and promptly gave us menus and took our drink order. She dropped our drinks off quickly, but then we had to flag her down to take our food order. That seemed to be the theme of the night. We were constantly looking for someone to acknowledge us. Don't get me wrong, the server was nice when she came by. But she lacked a sense of urgency and if we weren't waving at her, she probably would've never come back to check on us. It was busy when we arrived, so perhaps service was slow because of that? But once it cleared out, service really didn't get any better. So I don't know what was going on there.  All that aside, onto the food and drinks portion of this review! I had a red wine sangria and it was verrrry strong. I like strong drinks so I enjoyed it. But if you prefer something sweet that doesn't taste like alcohol, don't order the sangria. My friend's sister got a peach Bellini and it was really sugary. She likes sweet drinks, but found this to be almost too sweet. I ordered the Pulled Pork Poutine. It was HUGE! Our server warned me it was quite large, and I'm glad she told me that so I didn't order too much food. I liked the poutine. A good amount of gravy and pulled pork was tender. Was it the best poutine I've ever had? No, but it still had nice flavor to it. My two friends both got the Buffalo Chicken Wrap. They both found it had waaay too many onions in it and the onions overpowered everything else in the wrap. They were disappointed by the dish and said they wouldn't order it again.  Next time I am in the area, perhaps I would come here again for a quick bite. But the meal just wasn't outstanding, so I would probably just stick to snack food or poutine here."}
{"text":"McCain fries?????  Really???   And the pizza my wife ordered looked like something off a kid's meal.  This was for the Kelowna location, but it is too new to be on Yelp, I guess.  Your menu needs to updated for BC.  This may work elsewhere, but I'm not sure it will work in BC.  It won't for us I'm afraid.  Good beer list on tap ... that's the only draw for us at this point."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went there last night for dinner. Thought we should try the new place out. Service was just ok - I think she was overwhelmed or maybe got slammed with multiple tables at once, not sure. Nice girl but not super attentive. Drinks sat empty for quite a while, empty plates sat for a while, needed to request her through another server. The wings weren't actually wings but rather chicken nuggets (processed meat in other words), my shrimp tacos were lukewarm and hubby's sheps pie would've been good except he thought there was too much cheese on top.  After my first bite into the tacos I did let my server know they weren't hot and requested a fresh plate be made. She apologized and said no problem. Once my hubby was taking his last bite of his meal, my tacos arrived. Slightly warmer than before, but not much. But at this point I'm hungry and just want to eat. Once we received the bill our server informed us that the tacos were comped - which we appreciated as we didn't expect that at all. So I give them props for that. Overall though I don't think we'd go back. There's too many other choices here in Airdrie now."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while for the wings, which are fantastic. Ordered the dessert poutine from Barb this evening. It's mini doughnuts + caramel + chocolate + whipped cream. This might be the tastiest dessert ever."}
{"text":"Nice place, good food. They just need to turn the volume down a little it's nice to be able to the hear the person across from you."}
{"text":"Two pubs have come and gone from this establishment, so when a friend mentioned it was re-opening as another pub I didn't have very high expectations. I'm so glad I gave this place a chance because we are pretty much here on a weekly basis!  As a Canadian themed sports bar, their menu is heavily built around it. Poutine? Check. Montreal smoked meat sandwiches? Check. Burgers named after John Candy and Rita McNeil? Check!  Usually our weekly rendezvous to Brewhouse is on Wednesdays for wings night. $4.80 for a pound of wings (classic or boneless with your choice of over 30 flavours? The possibilities are endless!) and $7.50 tankards of every beer on tap. My favourite flavours would have to be chipotle mango and hotty-yaki.  I have ventured off the wings though! I've tried the classic and nacho poutine (not really a fan of their gravy unfortunately), garlic fries (super garlicky but the fries get soggy from the melted cheese), fried pickles (yum!) and the donair pizza (also yum! A close second to Seniore's I must say)   They have food and drink specials everyday ($4.25 for two topping 8\" pizzas on Sundays - who wants to cook on Sundays anyways?!) and I'm still due to try their $1 taco Tuesdays and $0.35 jumbo prawns Thursdays!  I recommend this place for sure, and if you do come on a Wednesday I'm probably already there, so come say hi :)"}
{"text":"Oh Brewhouse. You disappointed me. I'm not sure we can be friends anymore. Sigh.  I went to the brewhouse on Sunday October 18th for breakfast. It was ten after 10:00, however the door was locked. Perhaps they're closed I thought to myself, but my husband insisted they were always open on Sunday's and the sign on the door backed up his claim. I decided to call the restaurant. The phone rang and rang, finally answered with a tired \"brewhouse\". \"Are you guys open today?\" I inquired. \"Uh we are open everyday at ten!\" Sang the condescending male voice on the line. \" well your door is locked.\" I replied. \"Huh.\" I don't typically find that type of response helpful. \" do you suppose someone could unlock it?\" I asked. \"Yeah I guess so!\" Again, said in a sarcastic and condescending tone.  So this dude comes and unlocks the door, looks at me and says \" sorry. I was on the phone with some annoying lady.\" I wanted to pour a gallon of sour milk on his head. Buddy, you're not funny. You're a condescending ass.  I won't be back because of this guy. No one deserves to feel like crap for asking a question.  Ps: let your female staff choose what to wear. The skirts are sexist. Unless you offer a skirt for your male employees as well, you're actually breaking the law."}
{"text":"Best place in the far north to get some late night grub, a beverage and watch the sun set from the deck.  Barb was very attentive to us, even though we only wanted a small snack. We didn't have time (and was driving) so no drinks but she didn't mind. She was still checking to make sure we were okay and didn't need anything else. She gave us Tragically Hip Tix. I will be sure to check that out as well."}
{"text":"This was my very first time here. I had the loaded beef dip that was absolutely amazing and hubby had cob salad ( boring) but both were great. Only had to wait a few min for a table. We waited at the bar and right off the hop the bar tender spilled a schooner size beer on the counter. It got my pants a bit and my phone. We got seated right away and the manager came over and offered dry cleaning. I was wearing jeans so no biggy. He then got a bag of rice for my phone that got wet and it's all great. He then gave us a free shot mmm. So for our first time being here it was entertaining but it was great all around so we will be back."}
{"text":"Canadian burger w fries was hot & flavourful. Lots of beer to choose from. Great service in a busy place.  Plenty of TVs to watch any sort of sports. Plenty of good music piped in."}
{"text":"The rating is meant to target the franchise rather than any one establishment. In this establishment I have observed good service and reasonable timed dish output. The Brewhouse is a great place to have a beer, watch the game and maybe have an appetizer.   But that is it, as far as I am concerned. Although I have had a few dish on the menu that were decent, the overall food is disappointing. Average pub fair at best. There are many pubs that are going above any beyond with their food and this is where I can be found. Taste are subjective and people have different opinions but this is mine."}
{"text":"We went to try it out at the behest of my 15-year-old son (minors are allowed until 8 PM) and I am pretty sure I know why that was now...but we'll get to that. You are first greeted by a pretty cool sports bar decor, with one wall made from old hockey sticks, another made from backlit corona bottles, and about 65 big screen TV screens including four made into a \"Jumbotron\" above the bar. If you want to catch the game, there is no way to find a bad seat in the house for that.   We sat ourselves in the area up top and immediately noticed that for a Wednesday lunch hour, the place was packed! We were served quite promptly by our server and received our drinks right away. Between three of us we ordered 2 of their daily special of tenderloin, mashed potatoes and Caesar salad for $12.99 which came skewered with a lottery ticket, a pound of wings (we ordered another later) and their bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeños. The steaks were cooked well to order and the wings were reportedly delicious (my son's meal). The bacon wrapped jalapeños were absolutely disgusting. Rather than the traditional method of stuffing them, they have opted for a lengthwise halving, plopped the cream cheese on top, then wrapped the wildly varying sizes of peppers with bacon. I am not sure what made those tiny little peppers so wilted and shrivelled, but it sure wasn't too much time in the oven judging from the practically raw bacon draped around them. I took the bacon off mine and ate the pepper, well, a bite of it. Yuck! My partner bit one and that was all. He spat his out and he likes tender bacon. A food abomination like this would not have been so notable aside from the \"Oh, that's too bad\" we received from the server and the $11.99 we paid to have a revolting looking plate sitting in the middle of the table, but we probably would have replaced it with something else and had a better dish to rave about and remember. I am pretty sure our server loaded up on Valium before her shift, so to be fair it may be why she didn't apparently care about too much beyond a monotone repetition every time she was near the table of the phrase \"How's the food..\", it was not so much a question, though.  My impression of the place takes me back to why my 15-year-old probably wanted to go back even after his Dad and StepMamma won't return. I later learned they disliked the food. His first reason is he loves chicken wings and they did wings pretty well. The second is likely that, for whatever reason, despite the failure of Fox in Airdrie that had similar female uniforms and the closure of Hooters and The Tilted Kilt in Calgary, they seem to feel that their establishment has enough other positive qualities to buck the widely reported trend away from scantily clad, (and in our case, vacuous) servers. They wear skirts that do not fully cover the buttocks of their female servers- no joke, you can see a full quarter cheek of the female servers butt cheeks while they are standing up straight! The male server and the male bartender were dressed quite sharply, but it was a conservatively striking contrast to the scantily clad women and even left a bad taste of objectification in my Fiancé's mouth (although, again, that could have been the appetizer...). I am all for sexy and revealing, this was just overplayed, predictable and trashy.   I would maybe go back to watch a hockey game, order wings and enjoy a few beers. It would not be my first choice, which is unfortunate as the menu had some tempting offerings and the decor was really inviting and even had a \"Terrence and Phillip\" mural. When the novelty of being new wears off, there is nothing so unique or special to keep this place busy."}
{"text":"This review is specific to the Mahogany Brewhouse. I enjoy the atmosphere of every Brewhouse I go to around AB and SK, the one in Mahogany is the worse. The waitresses are great, but the service is very slow and the manager (although he comes and apologizes) doesn't really care. The first month after opening was great, they had trainers in the kitchen and floor from all over the country. Once those experienced people left the service went downhill. The excuse from the manager was that they are busier than they ever anticipated on wings night and pizza night and he is working on it.  Fast forward 4 months, it's the same old story is still the same, getting old.  On pizza night I took my kids there and we had to wait 50 minutes for the pizzas. The kids got so tired that I had to box the pizza and go home as they got bored and tired.  I am hoping they take all these feedbacks sincerely as we live the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Rene in Ft McMurray was the best bartender ever, super helpful and hot! Food was outstanding. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Standard pub, regular food you would expect... ok beer list. The summer is the best time to come because you can sit on their patio, which is elevated and quite spacious."}
{"text":"We were craving nachos this day, so the Brewhouse was the closest pub. This place use to be owned by two pilots that called it The Flight Deck, and it was bad (not good).  It's a cool two story pub with lots of TV's everywhere and a nice atmosphere. The nachos were really good - and huuuge!  It's hard to screw up nachos (although I could name a few places that do), and they were great. We also had steak bites, which were sooo good. Little bite sized pieces of steak a steak sauce dip that's amazeballs. Go try them.    It was a good day. Good lunch!"}
{"text":"We came to the \"soft opening\" of the Mahogany location on Sunday July 23rd.  The place was packed!  We had a set menu and were served:  ...  nachos ...  chicken club ...  chicken taco salad ...  buffalo chicken wrap ...  souvlaki pizza  ...  dessert poutine  I remarked to one of the managers, Rob, how impressed I was with the service.  There were probably 50 staff on the floor & behind the bar and another 30 staff in the kitchen.  They were running like a finely tuned machine - although they had only had 1 previous \"test\" service the night before (private crowd, by invitation only).  The service was quite quick.  The food came out quickly and was the right temperature - it was beautifully presented as well.  I personally had the chicken club - there was some kind of Cajun or Blackening seasoning on it that I must have missed on the menu - it was too spicy for my liking but I just can't tolerate spicy foods (digestive issues - oy vey).  Our friend had the buffalo chicken wrap - said it was too spicy for him, but the BF had the other half of the wrap and he added hot sauce - so .....  you decide for yourself if you like it spicy or not.  The waitress (Leteecia) recommended the dessert poutine and lets just say ...  OMG it was delish!!  (see if I can post a photo of the dessert)  There are a lot of TV screens around and I observed 3 different games being played.  There is an upstairs outdoor patio as well - I imagine it will be a local hotspot!  I enjoyed the experience.  Kudos to the new Mahogany team on a great opening of the new House!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i usually go there for specials like taco tuesday or pizza Sunday or we go to spend time with friends. Usually decent food and no issues. My recent experience i thought would be the same. I had the braised beef grilled cheese sandwich. However at the end of the meal or 40 mins later, i felt aa little sick.  it led me to run to the bathroom where i had severe and instant food poisoning. During my ordeal i heard a little girl complain about stomach issues as well. Not sure if it was a one off night but don't think ill be back for awhile.. or will stay away from the beef."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood of this restaurant and I would like to drop by more often. Unfortunately, I don't care for the level of the service. I am usually disappointed in the standard things a sever would do for you (offer you water, double check the meal was delivered with everything that you asked for, and later on ask if there is anything else you needed). I just got get those standard items at the Canadian Brewhouse. On my last visit there was a loud obnoxious person that the restaurant didn't do anything about. Eventually, the restaurant manager approached our group of 4 and offered we could all share one dessert.  Seriously? I will wait another year or two before I go back. ps. The deck is fantastic but they don't have enough umbrellas to keep the sun of your eyes while you eat:"}
{"text":"Great food just don't go there on a weekend in the evening....it turns into a loud crazed drunk fest bar."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the burger. Good busy atmosphere if you want to be in a loud social gathering type restaurant. Not as we suited for a one on one quiet conversation type meal. The free bus ride to flames game is a huge bonus. Drink down a beer before stepping onto the bus and you can have a worry free experience of no parking, and being able to have a couple more beers at the game. Seriously I hope to never drive to a flames game again with this service. Remember to tip your driver!!"}
{"text":"The good: The space itself is very nice, has not changed any since it was Stonehill The food is very good which is of course very important (tried the veggie pizza, steak bites, $1 Taco Tuesday soft beef tacos and the deep fried pickles - no complaints whatsoever) The Specials during the week are good an bring the people in! Good value.. The patio if you can get onto it Management comes by randomly to check in and see how you are liking everything $4.25 Corona and Twisted Teas on Tuesdays! Lots of parking in lot Extensive menu, something for everyone  The bad: First impressions - for some reason the lower level is shut down so one must climb up to the second level and let me tell you those stairs need a good sweep/clean The bar floor also needs cleaning Fruit flies (more than normal) at bar Bartenders - female bartenders seem to care less about female patrons and cater to the males, oozing with greetings, introductions and compliments - awkward and weird! Before 5pm, much of the patio is closed as there are not enough servers so you may not get a seat outside on a nice day The music playing could be sooo much better. It was a mix of the worst 80's tunes possible and the heaviest metal possible  Overall, if you like pub food and that overall level of service, I recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5 Service: 1.5/5 Ambiance: 2.5/5 Overall Rating: 3/5 (With heavy rating on food)  1 - Terrible; would not recommend and will not return. 2 - Poor; would not recommend. 3 - Average; nothing to rave about, would not be my first choice. 4 - Great; highly recommend and would go back. 5 - Fantastic; a rare score, restaurant with over-the-top and exceptional food and service.  **********************************************************************************  From Flight Deck ... to Stonehill Restaurant ... to Canadian Brewhouse, third time's the charm!. It's not the best bar I've been to in Calgary, but it's a HUGE step UP from what it was before. Plus, this Edmonton franchise is one of the few (better) bars in the area.  What drew me to The Canadian Brewhouse was its cheap daily specials and large variety of wing flavours. They even have DEATH SAUCE!!! The bar is fairly large with two floors, an outdoor patio, and several booths to sit in. What peeves me off though is that they often close the bottom floor so customers are turned away. The overall theme is a Canadian-inspired sports bar with several TVs and Canadian themed memorabilia lining the walls.  The brewhouse has been opened for less than a month, so the staff is still fairly new and getting into the groove of things. I've been here a few times and every visit I would get 3-4 different servers. Talk about over-serving and confusion... I was asked more than once if I wanted drinks and if I enjoyed my food. I also disliked how there wasn't a hostess to greet guests inside. You seat yourself, but the servers don't really acknowledge you and it ends up being awkward standing around waiting for a table. Nonetheless, the waitresses were friendly and eager when they served you.  The bar has a variety of drink choices that are a tad expensive unless it's a special. A ceasar for example was ~$8 with variations like the inclusion of a pepperoni stick and a mango spiced rim. Beers come in 5 sizes (Stein, Pint, Tankard, Schooner, or Jug) and starts at ~$7.  The food menu has a little bit of everything for everyone including a selection of poutines, hamburgers, wraps, sandwiches, pizza, and wings with a Canadian theme in the name. The prices are reasonable (under $20) and the portions are large.  - Nacho Poutine with black olives, jalapeños, onions and peppers: The poutine was just OKAY (they used mozzarella cheese), but I liked how the gravy wasn't overly salty and focused on tiny details like including guacamole, salsa and sour cream like real nachos.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-canadian-brewhouse-calgary?select=BW9kgQ35GbM6cmhJDjSPHw#EhsJPpkg5wfu2vLyXlbVaQ  - Atlantic Canadian Donair with homemade donair meat, mozza and cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions: This was my first time trying a Halifax-style donair, which has a tangy, sweet donair sauce. Other than the sauce, the wrap was very generic and the texture of the meat was crumbly and mushy.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-canadian-brewhouse-calgary?select=BW9kgQ35GbM6cmhJDjSPHw#9D-7sO19xMiJmsB-4tYgqQ  - Sunday Pizza Special: For only $4.00, their 8 inch two topping pizzas were surprisingly good. You can get it with a thin or thick (more like mildly medium) crust, which held together well under the bubbly cheese and toppings. Would recommend going during their pizza special ONLY.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-canadian-brewhouse-calgary?select=BW9kgQ35GbM6cmhJDjSPHw#xHljTyREt72ilQPT4OZUtw  - Wednesday Wings ($4.80/lb): Nothing special other than you have a choice of over 20-30 sauces/dry rubs like butter chicken, chili lime, maple cinnamon and more. They came out fast and hot.   - Thursday $0.35 Breaded/Non-breaded jumbo prawns: Are my favourite! They were hot and fresh, super crispy from the panko breading (with the sauce on the side), and the shrimp wasn't the drinky kind. Recommend as a snack.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-canadian-brewhouse-calgary?select=BW9kgQ35GbM6cmhJDjSPHw#BW9kgQ35GbM6cmhJDjSPHw  On a side note, they have a $1.00 beef taco on Tuesdays.  The Canadian Brewhouse is a nice place to go to if you live in the area. I don't recommend making the trek from the south to here. Other than the cheap food/drink specials, I don't really see myself coming here often solely for the food and drinks."}
{"text":"We love going here regardless of how snooty the girl waitress' are. It's super loud but a fun atmosphere and they have excellent food. Nice and big too, and lovely to sit on the patio for the summer!"}
{"text":"Brought 25 co-workers here for a retirement gathering. Was dealing with the manager over email regarding our reservation when he just stopped replying. Called the restaurant the day of to confirm, and was told he had left for vacation but yes we can still come. Got there and the bartender and waitress did not expect us at all. Service was average not overly friendly. Was not told about the 18% gratuity in advance, so assumed there would be one added to the bill automatically. Added an additional tip assuming the other tip was already included. Was then pulled aside by another manager reprimanding our party for tipping so low, and it was explained to me that they have dishwashers, servers, bartenders and more to divide the tip upon.  Love the layout and view from this place though..."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. We sat at the patio upstairs and enjoyed some cold beers and wings. The wings came per pound, each basket contained 8 fat wings/drums. The hot sauce and BBQ sauce was pretty generic, but the wings were tender and meaty. I liked that celery, carrots and cucumber were included and served with ranch sauce. Service was good. I noticed it was busy even though it was mid afternoon on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Hockey. Poutine. Dropshots. Not beer.  Don't get confused - this isn't a Canadian brewhouse, it's a Canadian Hockey House. Fan of beer? Go elsewhere. Fan of hockey? Now we're talking! The Canadian Brewhouse (Hockeyhouse) has two jumbotrons. It's two levels tall and each one gets it's own jumbotron. Awesome.  Apart from being decorated mostly with televisions, what little space is left over is taken up with, you guessed it, Hockey kitsch. Even the stair rail is made out of hockey sticks because Canada. There's also brightly lit (American) beer kegs and a large Inukshuk statue in front. I'm guessing also because Canada.  I've got this sneaking suspicion this place turns into one of those strange dance pubs for selfie taking suburban 18 year olds on the weekend...  They've got some food options that seem kind of fun. Our server (black t-shirts and plaid skirts - because Canada?) carried a DESSERT POUTINE to another table and my jaw dropped. Brown sugar and cinnamon doughnut fries with Chocolate sauce and ice cream gravy. Oh Canada!  It was Taco Tuesday, so I went with the $1.50 tacos. I wouldn't recommend. But if you get really stoked about Taco Time, then you'll probably only be a little disappointed. $1.50 extra for a tiny amount of salsa and sour cream. They're not that great and they're not even close to authentic... which I guess makes them Authentically Canadian!! Points to your commitment below average confused Mexican food, Canadian Brewhouse. I salute you!   For drinks, they have some awesome sounding drop shot options that seemed like they'd be pretty fun. Yet again reinforcing this would be a great place to get loud during a hockey game at.  I'm seriously impressed with their lack of beer selection! It's like the Derek Zoolander Beer Calendar in there. \"Bud? Coors? Canadian?! They're the same beer! Doesn't anyone notice this?! I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!!\" With 20+ taps you'd think they'd slip up and accidentally carry something local (or, you know, even Canadian) but nope! Somehow, they still manage to keep their beer selection more basic-ass than any bar I've seen in a long time.  It's not a Brewhouse. It's a Hockeyhouse. Go here because you want hockey, not beer. But also drink beer while you're watching hockey..."}
{"text":"Best pub in town! I have been to Pour, Toad&Turtle, Original Joes, Brewsters; this blows them out of the water. Great food, good service, awesome building.   Went in this morning after hockey. We were the first customers as it just opened today. Tons of staff around, super nice, and recommended food for all of us. Its mostly pub food, but very well made. Huge menu, from wings and poutine, to pizza and fish and chips. It was hard to decide what to order as it all sounded so good.  Lots of beer on tap, all the major names, and some rare ones like Sapporo.  Only difficulty was the server couldnt print one persons bill, so the early guy to leave had to pick his seat off the bill of all eight of us."}
{"text":"Sort of like a better version of a lot of American semi-upscale casual places. Good beer selection. Shows sporting events. I saw a plate of nachos the table across ordered. Looked pretty solid. I ordered a tanker beer and then got the poke bowl."}
{"text":"They have good selection of food. We go there often as a group to just chill and eat. Their cactus fries are my favorite and comes in big portion. Other food are good. Their servers are nice and on top of their duties which is really positive."}
{"text":"For now I will give the place a 4 out of 5 stars and that is with me giving this establishment a break. I am trying to go easy on this place because I know it was the first weekend of it being opened as it just opened on Monday. The wait was an hour to get a table on the patio and when we went upstairs we noticed that the patio had so many open tables. When you ask for a table on the patio they direct you to the bar and say you can wait here until your table is ready and have this fancy system where they text you to let you know when your table is ready. I believe that this is just a scam to get you to buy drinks at the bar because when we went upstairs to the patio there were many open tables. It was also an hour wait for food because the kitchen was behind. The patio is really nice though and has misters when it's hot and heaters for when it's cold. I also had a really good drink for a good price called the \"white freeze\" and is alcoholic and tastes like an actual white freezie.  They also have a great selection of poutine!  Overall, this place is getting 4 stars just because I loved the patio and my drink so much and we will see what happens next time I go when it's been open for longer if it goes up or down :)"}
{"text":"Well below average food by pub standards. Do not spend your money here. Service was good but that's about it."}
{"text":"So me and my bud go in to grab a bite and catch up. We walk in and man it is packed. We find a couple of seats as soon as we walk in and the waitress (who was also pretty hot) was really nice and came to take our drink orders a few minutes after we walked in. The place was packed and loud with televisions everywhere, music playing, and tons of cool sports paraphernalia around. Me and my friend ordered the donair pizza and spicy BBQ boneless chicken wings. Food was delicious, the only problem with it is that the donair pizza was served with tomato slices on it, like a lot of them. We took the tomatoes off the pizza and luckily they weren't super wet or slimy so the pizza was fine. The pizza itself was really good and the wings were nice and moist on the inside. A few recommendations; if ur gonna get wings then go on Wednesday because 1 pound of wings is $5 if  not mistaken, the nest is order your pizzas with thin crust because it gives a nice balance of crust and toppings, and if you do order the donair pizza then ask for no tomatoes. Overall the experience was very good and the waitresses were really attractive, just be wart because it can get loud in there."}
{"text":"The Worst service and food was not good drinks were overpriced. The only thing good was the amount of tvs. we sat for 27 min before getting drinks when I got my sangria it had 2 to 3 oz of drink the rest was ice. it's a 6 oz glass and felt totally ripped off for $6.99 I told our server she did not correct it. said sorry the manager said that's how it is. No serving or managing skills here!! total disappointment. they acknowledged us after 15 mins sitting then came back 10 min later to take our drink order. wings weren't that good they were so so. But the lack of service and professionalism was insulting. I will never recommend this place nor will I spend my hard earned money here. I prefer ojs or blue devil golf course if you can take the drive there. quality value service all things this place does not have."}
{"text":"lunch out with coworkers.   I have been her twice now and all my coworkers seem to love the Buffalo chicken sandwich or wrap.  me on the other hand I don't know if I just order boring things but I'm never impressed with what I order. We seen to get free appetizers for lunch must be a promotion for the lunchtime  in the week days. We got the stake bites and that was the best part of my meal. I cant really say this place dose anything special for me except pushing the button for service like your on a airplane."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and all smiles everywhere. Heard about this place, and I was visiting from California. Glad I made a visit, atmosphere was cool, TV's everywhere! I sat at the bar, bartenders were cool and on point. Wine specials were right on for a Thursday night. It's hockey country but glad they had the Warriors on, playoffs. Bartender even asked if I wanted personal speaker to hear the game, I appreciate that. Awesome place, keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing view from the patio... One of the best. Cheap beer but the food can be better. Very bleak and standard. Nothing special about it.... Would definitely go back but we'll think twice before ordering food again."}
{"text":"Ok finally have been able to go to CBH in Mahogany twice.   Large large local pub for SE with lots of TVs, sports memorabilia and the Roof Top patio. Lots of booths and bar area inside and outside.   Great daily specials (can't go wrong with Wednesday $5.99 wings!).   Menu has plenty of standard food options. Pricing overall is good for what you get!  Staff are super friendly and won't be disappointed.   Overall pub is family friendly to 20:00 and is very lively. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Before catching our flight bck to Toronto we had one last meal with our wonderful friends here. The ambience was fun, food was delicious & svcs was fast & friendly. Really best way to end our Easter holiday Calgary we'll be bck"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the bar food and environment.  We got there early to get a good spot upstairs.  We enjoy the steak bites and nachos."}
{"text":"My oldest Babygirl works here, that's why I was initially going to come but she wasn't working this day:( My friend was in the mood for pub food which is a rarity for me, I thought it was a bad idea but we went and I was delighted to see they had some GREAT menu options. I had the Filet Mignon w/button mushrooms, roasted potatoes, veggies and gravy for less than $20.00. There was a LOT of LOVE cooked in that little 6oz, I left full and HAPPY! I will be back. Lots of big screen, looks like a great place to watch the UFC."}
{"text":"Canadian Brewhouse had some making up to do for me. My first experience at one of their restaurants was a little over a year ago in Kelowna. Our sever was terrible, the buffalo chicken poutine pizza was a soggy mess, and the beer selection was sorely missing local options.  This location opened recently close to my house so my wife and I went to give them a try. The place was busy which was expected for a Friday night. We were told it would be a 10 minute wait, but the text message we received confirming we were on the list said 15 minutes. In reality we only waited about 5 minutes.  The layout seems to be similar between restaurants with the bar in the middle with a Jumbotron-like setup of TV's above it and all the tables and booths around. For a sports bar I find it odd that all of the tables and booths here are for 4 people or less. There's no seating for larger groups and it looks like they would just push their long tables together so that you can yell across the restaurant to each other. Oh yes, you will be yelling. The place is LOUD.   Our server was friendly and generally on the ball. The tables have a pager device so if you need service, you can just push a button. When we were seated we weren't given menus. There was a drink menu on the table but it doesn't have a beer list. We had to wait for our server to bring the food menu to look at the beers they have to offer. Then I felt I was rushed to make a decision. The beer list is large and completely InBev owned. If you want craft your closest option is Mill Street. There are no local beer options. I went with a Tankhouse.  I told my server about the previous bad experience so she suggest I go with the beef dip and a poutine. I loaded the beef dip which means they add cheese, peppers, onions and mushrooms. The poutine was the cheeseburger at the suggestion of the server. My wife went with the chicken parm.  The wait for our food seemed a little long, but not terribly. The portion size is definitely large. The beef dip is sliced into 4 manageable pieces held together by toothpicks. I don't know if some of the dip spilled on its way to my table or if its the construction of the sandwich, but the bottom bun was soggy. The au jus is served in a stainless container that is too small to comfortably dip your sandwich in. I don't have excessively large hands and I found it hard to hold the sandwich and dip. The onions and peppers are diced so most of them fall out of the sandwich as you try to navigate the soggy bun. There's supposed to be mushrooms on the sandwich and there was...two slices. Overall the sandwich was tasty, but it was a soggy mess, like the pizza I had a year ago. I also don't understand why they need to burn the bun with their logo. I know where I am and don't need the reminder. Oh right, they're making sure other people know where you are when a picture goes online.  The poutine...was cold. It would seem that it was either sitting for a long time before coming out or the dish they serve it in was cold when the fries were poured in. The flavour of the dish is good, but the cold fries were a big turn-off.  I had a couple bites of of my wife's dish. It was average, but most pasta dishes are at many many restaurants.  Something I find odd about this place is that they have a kid's menu. I don't understand why you want to bring your kids here.  This is a sports bar, so I'm sure they'd understand why we're now at two strikes for this chain. We all know what happens after the third strike."}
{"text":"Dessert poutine to die for.  Canadian burger is made with great quality. Super tasty and the bacon was perfect. Lettuce was a little oversized. Salad was fresh. Kitchen staff rocks here.  Schooners we're a great price on Thursday.  Courtney was an epic hostess."}
{"text":"We came here because they are a CSSC sponsor. Service was pretty terrible to be honest - our server seemed to be in a daze and simply did not care to be there. She answered our questions with a \"why are you even asking\" kind of attitude. But I would return despite the horrendous service. Why? Because as a CSSC sponsor, Canadian Brewhouse offers a free serving of nachos to every pair of CSSC member on the night of your games. The nachos are the same size as if you paid regular price, which is quite large! This is probably the best deal I've ever seen in my past 6 years as a CSSC player."}
{"text":"A nice local pub with some good food selection. A great place for some Gluten Free food such as their pizzas.  Overall, i would rate their food pretty average but they have some unique menu selections such as their Poutine list and Caesar drinks.  The staff have been pretty good with good service. They have these special devices at every table where you can buzz your server if you need anything...so there really is no excuse for not getting your servers attention.  I would recommend this place for a few drinks. Lots of seats and TV's to watch the game. Probably one of the better pubs in the NW"}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Brought wrong salad with meal.  The Greek salad tastes like it had water for dressing."}
{"text":"Came here on a really busy evening. St Patrick's Day celebrations are no joke at a pub! It was jam packed but our server was still extremely pleasant with us and very tentative. At one point she even apologized for the wait when I felt she didn't even really make us wait for anything at all. The food was actually quite good. The dry ribs are very tasty. We also ordered the cheeseburger poutine and it was just like a cheeseburger with fries and gravy. It got a bit salty as I kept eating it. I tried the poutine dessert and it was also very good. The portions are ginormous!! Overall it was a good experience with the manager overlooking quality control."}
{"text":"Opening day so stopped in to check the new location out. Looks new, smells new and everything is really clean and super friendly bar staff. Had a few Stanley Park seasonals which tasted great, all draught is $5 for a Stein (12oz) before 7. Had an order of the Jalapeno poppers which were great, obviously homemade. Will be here again I am sure"}
{"text":"After watching two former restaurants in this location disappear it's nice to see a restaurant open with several other established locations around Alberta. They even had staff in from other locations to help train and get the Calgary staff up to speed.  Enjoyed a rare lunch date on the patio with hubs while the kids were at a party. Our server was in from GP and awesome..friendly, helpful and not pushy.  The menu is quite large and it took a while to narrow our choices down. I think I changed my mind 4 times. Love the names and little muses that are integrated in with your menu selections. We decided on burgers. Hubs went with the John Candy and I opted for the Backyard Blackened Burger with a side of Buffalo Chicken Poutine.  A massive amount of food arrived. The burgers were huge. One thing I did notice is one conjures up images of blackened food when they see it as a menu option. I expected a blackened spicy burger. But nope. Next to no spice was detectable on the burger. Plain and simple flavours. Very delicious however.  Washed as much as we could down with a beer from their delightful beverage menu. Loved watching the planes fly overhead and the small view we had from our table on this hot sunny day was lovely. Service was impeccable, food enjoyable.  Yes folks it's a keeper."}
{"text":"Food is ok. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and it came with no dressing like ranch or anything so I asked for ranch which every time I order a buffalo chicken wrap anywhere else u get a side of ranch so I asked assuming they just forgot and they charged me $2 for 2 sides. My husband got tacos and it came with no salsa?? So he asked for salsa and another $1 for each small side of salsa.  Waitress didn't tell us each side would cost us. It's not alot but more the fact that these things shouldn't cost money as they should be included with the meal and a dollar for how small the side is was very annoying"}
{"text":"I met a work friend for lunch today at the Brew House.  Pretty nice place inside, lots of TV's with sports on, a big bar, lots of seating and nice staff.  I ordered the Canadian Burger and fries.  My friend ordered the beef dip and sweet potato fries.  We got our food pretty quickly.  Here is where they lost a star or two for me.  I understand they are a franchise, and you should get the same food no matter which restaurant you go to, but ugh...its so bad!  The fries were...fries.  Crinkle cut freezer fries.  Can't say much more.  The burger looked and smelled ok, it had potential.  Sadly, after I bit into it the potential left.  It had that grey pressed sponge look.  I hate when you bite into something SO overly processed that you can't even imagine what is in it making it that way.  Flavor was OK, just OK.    Most chain restaurants are similar, they are what they are.  But I don't rush back to the Canadian Brew House."}
{"text":"Nice place but RUINED by service... been there twice and both times the servers had a terrible attitude. So rude both times... Not recommending that place at all."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast bowl I've ever had. Asked for some hot sauce to make it less dry and ended up getting charged for it.  It's a condiment   Coffee was good."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and randomly picked this brewhouse. My wife and I had never been to Canada and asked about every question you could imagine. Terrie was our bartender and could not of been more help. He helped me pick a great beer and got us some fantastic food. Very personable, patient, personable and a 5 Star bartender who helped us out when we were pretty clueless. Steak, Beer, mash potatoes, Beer, turkey club were all great. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Fun place to drink, lousy place to eat.   Once my boyfriend and I had the John Candy burger and the buffalo chicken wrap. Both were ok, I'd say 7 out of 10. Their fries, on the other hand, are pretty bad. (Made from frozen, pretty sure they're just the plain old crinkle cut McCain fries). As a result, their poutine is awful.   Their brunch was C- Just don't lol  They seem to have good drink specials every day of the week, beer is cold, and they have a nice Caesar selection.   Their staff is hit and miss. I've had a few of the girl bartenders be pretty snarky and rude to me, drinks poured into my lap, Caesar's made wayyyy too hot etc. I love spicy but instant heartburn is a bit much. Little things say there's not a whole lot of experience going on there.   Overall it's a fun place, especially on weekends. Just know to expect mostly mediocre food & service."}
{"text":"This is a great local spot!  We've been more than a few times, the food is quite what you'd expect to find at a bar, burgers, nacos, fries, ect....  Thier drink menu however is quite extensive and one of my favorite places to go for a good drink.  I really love thier variety of ceasars..my favorite has to be the dill pickle ceasar.  I also love thier candy inspired drinks.  I recommend this place if your looking to get a good meal, drink and watch the game as they are very much hockey orientated with TV screens available from every angle.  The decor is very nicely done and welcoming, they have lots of space and a nice patio in the summer that ovelooks the greenspace behind."}
{"text":"Update- I went back to try and give it another whirl and all I can say, is some of their servers need serious customer service training. The one female working the patio definitely has quite the attitude problem... so much so that my friend and I got up and left to go eat at State and Main. FYI the service at S&M is WAY better.  If I could I would give this location zero stars. I find the poor service really too bad because I've been a semi regular patron and only up until recently has service gone completely down hill.      Absolutely the slowest service EVER. I write this from a booth while waiting over 20 mins for a drink and water."}
{"text":"This is a chain of sports bars. Food is predictable. Beer is predictable. Service is at your beck and call with a little button on your table.  Noisy.  In other words, routine. Nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"Continuing in the Hemingway vein...  You enter into a room, dark not with secrets, but with the sad pretense of importance. Large flashing screens adorn the walls, and they cast shadows upon the barbed wire tattoos and drug mart make-up. The faces are hopeful with the promise of the afternoon quesadillas. The beer is boring, no grappa here, but the prices are low. One wonders not about the signora serving your poutine, but about the very premise as to whether this could ever be called poutine.  You exit into the large parking lot, and head towards someplace else."}
{"text":"This is the only steak house I will willingly go to. The buttons you can press for service are a great feature."}
{"text":"Awesome family friendly dining. Went with my two kids and they cleared their plates. I had the turkey clubhouse and was stuffed afterwards ,portions are so big:) great wait staff and awesome food. Would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"It's hard to find much wrong with The Canadian Brewhouse in Airdrie.  It's a huge and well-decorated place. Sports pub high end. Lots of booths and tables and a massive bar. There's no shortage of seats and SO many TV's! Good-looking crowd too!  My server was the bartender, and he really went out of his way to provide spectacular service. It was not crazy busy but you could tell he was a pro. Super nice guy too.   I had a chicken salad and it was fresh and delicious.  Great beer specials!  Why wouldn't you go?"}
{"text":"This place has changed owners so many times I can never get the name straight when telling friends on where to meet. Brewhouse offers a large selection of pub food and TVs everywhere you look, awesome place in the NW to catch up with friends while watching the Olympics or sit on the patio and enjoy our summer in between the monsoons.   Every time I come here we order the donair poutine which Canadian Brewhouse definitely knows how to do, hot enough to melt the cheese!! We also got the john candy burger and the calamari, both good and filling. Overall the food was good for pub/bar food but nothing to absolutely die for.   Sometimes the service is a hit or a miss either its exceptionally well and other times we are left wondering where everyone is. These last few times it has been great, our waitress francisne??was attentive, friendly and even was even able to chat with us given that it was pretty busy. Overall, great place in the NW for some sports and bar food! Happy munching!"}
{"text":"I frequently visit both Brewhouses in town. It's always a place where there is a good crowd with good sports entertainment on. Some nights it can even feel like a Dance club which is fun. Last night we got tickets for the Tomahawk Steak, 30oz in the bone steak. It was beyond over the top but it was also for charity so it was for a good cause. Had a great night and had some great laughs watching a couple of servers dressed up as cows. All in all enjoy the establishment and will be a regular visitor."}
{"text":"Seems like a great place but would not recommend a vegan or vegetarian as there are only 2 options really."}
{"text":"Have only been to this bar twice, once to catch the Flames Bus before the game and another time with my boyfriend. It has a nice set up and the service/staff is exceptional. They have a big menu with lots to choose from & a good drink menu too!"}
{"text":"This place is cool for eating dinner, talking to friends or celebrating anything. Burgers are amazing with their fries."}
{"text":"I am struggling with this review here. Like really struggling between a 1 star and a 4.  On several occasions we have ordered pizzas here for various functions, they are really good and the fact that that they offer GF crust was one of the reasons we do order from here.  We had ordered 5 or 6 pizzas for a hockey party and all were demolished and finished off by hungry kids and parents except for the GF one, as there were only 2 people on the team who had gluten intolerance/sensitivity, about half of the veggie GF remained, I was the lucky parent who took that one home to \"enjoy\" later.  Come 9:30, I had to have me a slice of that delicious veg pizza, admittedly, it was fantastic, the crust for GF was excellent.    SEVERE FOUL and points lost for the short and curly embedded in the cheese.    Dry heaving, just thinking about it.  Really sad about this and will take a long time to recover, unfortunately."}
