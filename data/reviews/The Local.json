{"text":"The service and food have been on point since my last review! We always end up having plenty of time left, the portion sizes are consistent and the staff are awesome!"}
{"text":"Amazing service , cocktails , and food is to die for... Pig ear pad Thai WOW!!  BRISKET WOW!! Oxtail tortellini. WOW!! My new favorite place in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Saw the restaurant as we were driving by.  We were moderately hungry but for sure thirsty for a good cocktail.  So glad we stopped in.  Drinks started off really nice.  A great pour.  We then started off with two appetizers; the bone marrow which was so ridiculously amazing and the tuna crude which was even better.  Because we weren't starving we decided to share an entree.  The brisket was our choice and a good one at that.  The meat just tore apart with a gentle tug.   The staff was very friendly and the decor and vibe were warm and inviting.  After we left the restaurant we commented to one another that this is a great addition to Roosevelt Row and a great addition to our restaurant repertoire.  Obviously I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"So we read great things about this place and we were excited to try it out. When we got there it looks like they have closed down. Sad we never got to try them out. It's been tough location for several restaurants."}
{"text":"My husband and I love trying new places with unique meals. After all, he is in culinary school and works at a restaurant. This place was very modern and fun. The Conquistador was an amazing drink, perfectly sweet. I got the Heirloom Cauliflower and my husband got the brisket and we were both very pleased. We had started off with the pig ear dish that was so savory. I highly recommend this place. We had a fantastic time and the chef was awesome and came over to say hello. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a beer and snack. Good craft beer selection, fun old school beats playing, friendly staff, and the chips and dip were tasty!"}
{"text":"First time ever in here, had the fresh deep fried mozzarella and was not impressed. The breading batter had no flavor at all, unless you smother it in marinara you won't like it. I got the Bacon Jam Burger, I believe it was a special, wasn't on the paper menu. All the flavor came from the jam they put on it. The burger doesn't taste like it has any seasoning on it whatsoever...a little disappointing. I don't consider myself a foodie, but the food was very bland all and all."}
{"text":"Chris and Adam really hit it out of the park with this one!  Ambience is fun and original, great vibe.  Drinks are excellent.  Food is fabulous!  Get the bone marrow, then do a luge shot out of the bone.  Gnocchi was more than I expected for sure.  Makes me wish I lived in Phoenix!  Great job!"}
{"text":"Downtown Phoenix newest place to see dude on dude action. Service was horrible tonight we had 4 waiters come up to our table each taking our drink order. One of the waiters gave us a fuck off look when we asked for a menus.  15 mins later when one of our waiters brought our drinks my beer was luke warm."}
{"text":"Food is great - everything up and down the menu.  They offer lunch specials during the week, which are a steal for Uptown.  The drafts average $5+, but the daily drink specials help even the cost.  Atmosphere is pure bar/pub, without being too divey.  Lunch specials combined with their lunch punch make it a solid lunch option, while the rest of the menu is well worth the cost."}
{"text":"Amazing. It's great to see places like this open in Central Phx. Both Adam and Chris go out of their way to make sure your nite is great. If you are a Foodie, you MUST visit The Local. Everything on the menu looks and tastes great. We tasted several  items while sitting and the Chefs Bar, and Chef Chris threw in a couple samples of other items. OMG, culinary heaven.  BTW, where else can you find 15yr MaCallan Single Malt on tap? Be sure and buy Adam and Chris a drink, they work hard."}
{"text":"What a phenomenal downtown gem. There is no where in downtown Phoenix like this. Perfectly balanced hand crafted cocktails and Absolutely stunning cuisine. Do yourselves a favor and order the Lambert-Gini and have the pleasure of the namesake handing you the lovely libation.   When you have your cocktail in hand don't hesitate order the bone marrow--two words-- lamb bacon: life changing. I never fathomed being able to get this level of food and class here in downtown phoenix. ( and for the great adventurers--when you've sucked it clean, order a shot of don Julio Reposado or any Mezcal and join the ranks of bone luge. All who work here will know)    More than Honorable mentions: brisket 3 ways: smoked, braised and grilled. Had to fight over the last bite.   Oxtail torteloni: all pasta is handmade in house and this dish easily rivals any in the greater phoenix area.    Do yourself a favor and stop in. Enjoy yourself and get away."}
{"text":"Man this place is good. Started off with the bone marrow one with lamb bacon and one with caramelized onion, sweet and savory.  One of the owners challenged me to the Jameson luge shot, way better than I thought it would be And the Branzino fish was also excellent! Tim made me a few good drinks at the bar. Great restaurant! Also, Jameson on tap!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location multiple times and have enjoyed myself each time. I must say the macaroni and cheese dishes are the best!!!! A must try! My only complaint was wait time for my food recently. It seemed as if they were understaffed for a Friday night. My food order took 30+ mins, which I found a little excessive. Overall a great place to go."}
{"text":"if i could give negative stars, i would. working in the service industry, i have never felt so unwelcomed in an establishment in my life! no one should be given \"dirty looks\" anywhere, at anytime."}
{"text":"What an incredible meal.   I live in NY and was in the restaurant industry in AZ for many years. I've known Chris from his days as a Sous Chef at NoCa and was delighted when my friend picked this for my first dinner back. Chris is extremely talented and the food was incredible.  Portions and pricing were excellent. We ordered everything on the menu, including the specials. My favorites were the Pad Thai, Fried Green Tomatoes, Gnocchi and Riblets.   Service, cocktails and wine were top-notch. I hope they become a pillar for this struggling part of town.  Well done boys!"}
{"text":"Very fun dive bar, with good bar food and REALLY good drinks specials. Especially on Friday nights!!!"}
{"text":"I recently just visited the Local on 5th for my lunch break today. I orded the California strip wrap that consisted of bacon, turkey, and GUACAMOLE. When the server brought out our food, I noticed it looked a little dry and something was missing.  That something was the guacamole.  This was already annoying due to the fact that my fries were cold, the wrap only consisted of 2 out of the 3 ingredients, and my lunch break was starting to dwindle down.  I politely informed the server of the missing item and she proceeds to tell me \" oh yea they just ran out of guacamole\".  First off, why wasnt I informed by the server prior to my food being brought to the table, and secondly why would the kitchen prepare something half way with out consulting with the server who should have asked the guest?? Slightly confused by it all, and frankly dissapointed because I fell like the establishment has potiental.  The server did offer me something else to replace my original menu item after hearing this was a problem.  She then gives us are checks and lets me know mine will be dicounted. The discount was $1.50 off my $11.00 meal -____-.  I know things happen but if the service was better and communicated to the guest better I promise it would not have been an issue.  However with this being said, its safe to say I will not be returning to The Local on 5th."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by this place at all. Extremely overpriced for the portion you receive. You pretty much are paying for the ambiance is all. The service was very slow considering they only had three tables in the entire restaurant. The presentation was nice, however, they at baby servings ... I am still hungry"}
{"text":"This was my second visit, after the grand opening. This time, however, was very disappointing. The bone marrow appetizer was gelatinous and stuck to the inside of the bone, making it very hard to get it out without the bacon flying all over the plate. The taste also stayed with me through to the next day. Then, I had the chicken fried quail. Unfortunately, it wasn't crispy at all as the breading was gloppy as if it was not cooked properly. I understand that quail are small, and so to call this an entree and charge this much didn't make sense. To make matters worse, the biscuit was burned on the bottom (very obvious because it was black) but slightly raw and doughy in the middle. And the chipotle flavor didn't work for me. Maybe I just ordered the wrong things this time, but now let's talk about the service. While our waiter was nice, he came to our table two times not noticing that our drinks had been empty. And when my dining companion asked for another drink, he just walked away without asking me if I wanted another glass of wine. I shouldn't have to beg for another glass of wine and ask for it from a waiter a few yards away at the POS station. Also, I shouldn't have to ask what the specials are as this is the server's job. I was so impressed the first time we came here and we were checked on by 3 different people to make sure everything was alright. However, this time, not even the manager cared to make sure that we were okay and it was not even busy during this weeknight. It's too bad this restaurant spent so much energy at the beginning and then totally forgot how to run a business. We won't be back for sure."}
{"text":"Okay... I don't usually write reviews... if something is good, I just tell my peeps and thats it... HOWEVER... I can't keep this one in...  there is too much to talk about... so, I will just touch on the most important... FOOD and service... both of which get a 5 star from me... I've been a vegetarian (eating fish sometimes) for about 7 years now and happy about it... so, at the chefs suggestion I tried the Grilled Heirloom Cauliflower... WHAT, WHAT, WHAT was I tasting... Jimney Cricketts!!! Queso Manchego and a cumin eggplant puree... ohhhhh my!!! you know when a kid does the pee pee dance, hopping from one foot to another... wooooooowhooooo that's what this feels like... AMAZING...   now, I said to my husband... who was busy happily munching away on Crispy Pig Ear Pad Thai... I think I want to try that Tuna thing... The Bigeye Ahi Crudo... Of course he said... without even looking up from his Pad Thai... when the tasty little morsels arrived at the table, I had to take a minute to enjoy the beautifully prepared plate... LISTEN... I never did understand the point behind plating... until now... a decadently cut tuna lay nestled on my plate with with a brightly colored, velvety avocado mousse... tangelo gelée...ginger and shallot confit...pistachio dust...Serrano chili... PARTY IN MY MOUTH!!! I had to copy the ingredients from the menu because my mouth couldn't explain what was happening in there!!!   moving on... now...the Roasted Bone Marrow shows up to the table... I have to admit... my curiosity got the best of me... I HAD TO... but wait... I'm a vegetarian... let's google that and see just what I'm getting into... vitamins... minerals... yada yadas ... okay... I'm tasting it... OHHHHH MYYYYYY GOODNESS... just a little taste... but between the lamb bacon...onion jam... and this ridic crostini... i might need another... and wow... wow... wow...  I can continue to gush... but I need to stop there... to say a quick thing about the service... between the Chef/Owner Chris... Bar manager/Owner Adam... and our server... we felt like we were regulars at the local... My husband and I were not dressed for a 5 star restaurant... However... we got the 5 star treatment!!! THANK YOU THANK YOU to all of you at The Local.... you guys rock... we will see you again"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food! The gnocchi was my absolute favorite and you cannot miss it if you go there. I really feel like we go out to dinner a ton, and this place did not have a dish even close to sub-par.  Loved our waiter, great service....it will be a place we talk about often.  Nice work, we will be back with friends soon!"}
{"text":"Great team behind the bar and on the floor. House made pasta always gets me! Great addition to downtown phoenix."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but they desperately need to hire more employees. The wait staff looks constantly irritated and stressed to the point of visibly cursing and bickering behind the bar. Every time I've been, I've heard customers complain about how slow the service is."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with co workers. I ordered the buffalo chicken grilled cheese with a side salad. I thought the sandwich was amazing and the salad was a very generous size! Prices were perfect for the portions. The staff was super friendly and they gave us a coupon for a 50% off lunch to come back. Look forward to heading back and trying something different."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks!  Adam, the owner is really cool.  Was there with the girlfriend and enjoyed the in house smoked salmon and grilled cauliflower dishes.  Can't wait to come back and see more of their rotating menu!  Chef has worked and some of the best restaurants in San Diego and AZ!  Adam gave us a great aperitif of the on tap Amaro Montenegro!!!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and loved it . Great space with hip music and waiters . Great wine selection and unique menu. I had the brazio fish special which was amazing."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday afternoon.  Great drink selection, awesome tacos, and really creamy mac n cheese!  Great place"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this gem on a spring walk on Roosevelt Row. Had the BEST service no joke in quite sometime. We will be back solely based on that alone. However the food we didn't get to order because it was a late Sunday right after the kitchen closed  (totally our fault) they were out of. So we decided to get a drinky & chill. I had the Lambert-Gini & the hubs had a beer. They were great & priced right for a reverse happy hour. We  were chilled & plotting our return at an earlier time because the menu looked pretty good. Then we got the best slightly tangy/sweet smoked brisket sliders on the softest rolls. Totally comp because they didn't have the item we only asked about. I remember service like this once upon a time but have been treated so badly over the years (especially on Roosevelt) just one establishment doing the right thing has thrown me for a loop & can't wait to get back. Thanks The Local for just being good peeps. Muah! Now go & try it for yourself. Trust me they're good."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch, sat down for 15 minutes. No menu, no server, no greeting.   If you're going to promote brunch and Sunday football get more servers."}
{"text":"As I walk in I feel a sense and a vibe of freshness, and as I sit down I look around I feel at ease. The server comes with the menu and let me seat myself. Its cozy and and I sit down on the left hand couch. The table is too high for the couch which creates a weird posture for eating. I order a beer and wait for more of my party.  The vibe is pretentious and shallow. Our server, and not only our server, hovers constantly asking how things are, ask if there's anything we need, interrupts conversations several times.. this is not good service. This is bad service. I don't want someone constantly on my ass when I am engaged with friends in conversations, and it is clearly that we are and have ordered both meals and drinks. We are paying customers - pardon me for wanting some time with the people I came here to meet, and not have a fit with the servers.   The food was very pretty, and pridefully weird. It was more interesting than it was tasty and it is clear that the main goal is to use odd ingredients in an attempt to be hip, now and fusion. Sorry it does not work without tastiness. Novelty has a very short shelf life. Pigs ears do taste like pork rinds, no matter what kind of strange salad you bed it onto. And bone marrow.. as some love it, I find it difficult. The taste isn't that great and the texture requires motivation to handle. Motivation I personally cannot muster.   The establishment is beautiful, and I love the idea.. because it is swank, it is on point, but the follow through falls flat. Service, food and drinks are less than I expect to pay for this kind of beautiful hip place. And the price only accompanies the locale, and not the iffiness of the meal. It's painfully pretentious and pricey and I expected so much more. I have doubt that the local will still be here for long, so if you really want to eat here - hurry."}
{"text":"Convenient place to grab a beer before a show. And they had good drink specials going on that night. My group of 8 was there Monday March 28, 2016 around 6pm. Sometimes you have to wonder about a place you walk into in such a prime, busy part of uptown only to find 3 people in there, especially when all the other nearby places were packed. But we were on a time schedule so we gave it a go. The big plus was the service. There was one waitress catering to the entire place. Of course, we were lucky to get there just before another 15-20 people showed up. But the waitress was very nice. Efficient for the amount of people she had to cater to, and I give her 5 stars. The food, um, not so enticing. French fries were ice cold. I ordered a chicken philly and if not for being starved, would not have eaten it. The meat tasted \"gamey\". Maybe it was old. I didn't get sick at least. The liquid cheese they put on there was absolutely disgusting. Why do restaurants use that garbage? For a beer and some TV watching, I would rate it very good. Food, not so good."}
{"text":"Flew in last night with 10 guys to attend a trade show. Went here for a a quick bite and a few beers. Great tacos and burgers. Nice selection of beer on tap. Sara and Shawn took great care of us and really seem to care about the customers. $2 tacos on Tuesday is hard to beat!"}
{"text":"Just a short review.  The Local is a good choice for after work drinks and eats, also a good choice for lunch.  Food is better than you'd expect.  Service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Gotta say... I'm afraid this place is heading down the same road as this locations previous tenants with prices like these. Make your menu more affordable, please! Phx can use cool places like this, but you're making the same mistakes that Scratch did."}
{"text":"This place is only in its soft opening at the moment, but even without being actually open they are doing some awesome things!  First I'll start by saying the service is impeccable. Typically, when a place is newly open I expect there to be lots of hiccups and missteps by the wait-staff. However, to my surprise this was not the case! We went here on First Friday, and even with a much larger crowd than I'm sure is typical, our server was amazing! She was attentive, extremely polite, and ultimately made our time here great.  I will say we didn't end up having any food this time around, but the cocktails were beyond! I had the Lambord-Gini, which is made with muddled watermelon I believe, and it was to die for. My bf had their take on an old-fashioned (the name escapes me right now) but I tried it, and even not being a big Old-Fashioned fan I thought it was super yummy!  The menu is definitely not what you'll expect coming to a casual place in downtown Phoenix. They have things like oxtail, bone marrow, and other oddities that you might expect to find at more of a fine-dining experience. But the prices are extremely reasonable! So it's everything you love about fine-dining, mixed with everything you love about casual dining. Low prices for amazing, unique food, in a great atmosphere.  We will definitely be back here once they have their grand opening on April 11th, and I will update my review then, once I've tried the food. Until then, I highly recommend checking this place out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"A decent place to stop in for a drink real quick.  Nothing special.  Havn't tried the food though."}
{"text":"Ok- what is the big deal?  I'm surprised to see how many 5 star reviews there are.  I agree with everything said in the 1 star reviews.   Late night menu sucks!  If you're gonna be open til midnight... Have a better menu.  Food... Eh.  As previously mentioned the gnocchi is ONE gnocchi for $10.   I left starving.  Their menu contains a bunch of weird meat and zero vegetables.  I'm all for local meats but usually that type of clientele is big on greens!  This place thought it was inventive & unique but it was limited & mediocre.   I'm seeing these rave reviews on ambience... I don't get it!  The Vig has ambience... This place is zzz."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My wife and I stopped in for a drink and wound up getting dinner too. What can I say; the service was on point. Great craft beers, triple c was my favorite. I got a burger, it was fantastic! Really juicy and fresh. My wife ordered some tacos. I don't know what were on them but she really enjoyed it. All in all a great place to chill out from the uptown hustle and have a great meal!"}
{"text":"I work in Hearst Tower, so I watched The Local transform from Phil's over the last few months. It's been awesome to see that exterior painting progress, it really makes The Local look like a place you'd want to stop by for a beer.  There are daily specials for both food a drinks, so there's always a way to save a few bucks here. I went on Wednesday which happened to be $2 off burgers and $3.50 local drafts. They had a pretty good draft selection, I think about 8 locals and 5 or 6 of the regular domestics.   Food wise, I went with the Dirty Jersey burger, which I would definitely recommend. Their burgers are a great size so you don't need to worry about leaving hungry. The sweet hot BBQ sauce on the DJ was great... it really set it off with the peppers & onions. My favorite part about meals is usually the side, and in this case, they have plenty of choices (with no up-charge!!!!!). Regular fries, waffle fries, tots, sweet potato fries ... they have a few others I can't even remember.   As far as 'bar food' goes, I would definitely not hesitate to come here for some burgers and brews again with some friends!"}
{"text":"The sweet nectar of youth dripping with gold. Seems to a little diamond out in the open. Heavy industry people from the looks of it. How I know this I am not proud. Yet the music is bright and sprite, with the gusto of self-deprecated laughter. Or maybe it is just me  | NOte. Keep going."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for the ball game, we came across this restaurant in a food blog.  Plenty of parking in the back.  Great funky atmosphere.  Super clean.  We sat at the bar and were excited to see some local AZ beer taps.  We had also heard their mixed drinks were great and we weren't disappointed.  Ordered the pig ear pad Thai and the pork belly octopus to start out. PHENOMENAL!  Great mix of flavors and so fresh!  Entree was also amazing-fish over lentils, then paired it with the heirloom cauliflower.  We ate every morsel on the plate.  The entire experience was enhanced by the great customer service.  We got there right as they opened and the owners, while obviously busy, took time to talk with us.  All around, a great experience!"}
{"text":"Great place!  From there moment we walked in we loved it. Intimate place, friendly people and a great urban location. We ordered an Arizona red wine and it was really great. I had the grilled romaine salad and it was crispy and the charred flavor have it a nice twist. My partner had the branzino and it was cooked to perfection. It was on a bed of barley and farro that was very creative and gave the fish an added flavor. I had the roasted bone marrow and it was delish. One bone had duck bacon (yum) and the second bone was bruleed which gave it a sweet and smokey flavor. Loved it!  Can't wait to see the fall menu. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic!!  Best in town, even on their first night open.   Service is personable and lively, ambiance is fresh, hip, relaxed and very comfy. Come to hang with a group or grab a bite on your way home. Cocktails are just as exciting as the menu-can't wait to try more on the next visit."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and cocktails! I had the pig's ear salad, ahi poke, gnocchi. We just told the chef to bring out whatever he wanted. Was not disappointed. Also had the \"green thumb\" cocktail with Tito's and the Sundancer. Will definitely be back to work my way through the menu."}
{"text":"Maybe I jumped the gun by suggesting to have brunch here last Sunday. I usually wait for a new restaurant to be open a few months before trying it, but I sometimes make an exception if there are rave reviews. In this rare occasion Yelp had failed me.  My husband and I had met my friend here and we shared 3 different plates. It wasn't noted that this was \"tapas\" style on the menu at all, nor was it suggested how to order, so we thought 3 dishes for 3 people would be enough food. For drinks my husband had a Sleepy Dog Hefeweizen, my friend a cocktail and I ordered a mimosa which was a pretty good deal at $5. My husband and friend's drinks came out immediately, while I was told they were waiting for a bottle of champagne to open. About 10 minutes later I received my drink.   Two of our orders arrived first, the tuna poke and the lamb kimchi fried rice. Our server then came over  told us that their computers had gone down, and due to the error he gave us a complimentary pig ear pad thai. We said \"Thank you\" as it's always nice to have that type of error work in your favor. He put the plate down on the table and as we were about to dig in another staff member walked up to our table and took the pig ear plate away without saying a word........awkward. The server apologized for the mistake, as it must have been a misunderstanding. We started our meal and then the staff member came back a few minutes later and put the pig ear plate back on our table again without saying a word. We were somewhat apprehensive of eating it a this point, was it going to be taken away again? Anyway beggars can't be choosers, I was very appreciative of the complimentary entree, but the awkwardness that came with it really wasn't worth it.  As for the food: the tuna poke was fresh tasting, but flavor wise it was nothing really special. The lamb kimchi fried rice tasted good, but was greasy and had the teeniest tiniest pieces of lamb in it. Our third order was the poutine, this was the best thing we had, it had a flavorful cream sauce, chunks of lamb and a runny egg. The pig ear pad thai was pretty good too, nice & crispy and came with pickled veggies.   So why two stars? The portions sizes were laughable, each entree was about 5 bites max. We weren't informed that one dish per person isn't even close to enough food. We ended up having an extra dish due to the snafu, but we still all left hungry. It would be one thing if the food was amazing, then I would want to order more dishes, but nothing was very memorable or fantastic enough. The price point did not match the portion at all. The service was also lacking, the server took our credit card to run it, and then waited a good 20 minutes to receive it back after having to ask for it. Sorry but I can't see myself returning."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time back in November 2016 with a group of work friends for Thursday   night trivia.  (Which alone would get this place 5 stars because it starts at 5:30- PERFECT for people just leaving work!)   I have been back a dozen times since, including a lunch. The servers are super quick and very attentive.  The food is above average (I've eaten every appetizer on the menu several times over) and my two favorites are the Nachos (add chicken!!) and the Mac n Cheese bites.  The tacos I had for lunch were also great.  My one complaint the last time I was there was the cheese sauce for my pretzel bites- it was maybe made from powdered cheese and tasted...gritty?  But again, one thing.  Great prices for both food and drink. As far as the restaurant itself, the furniture looks a little.. worn (but then again, the long table is a repurposed shuffle board table= cool!) and the hallway leading to the bathroom is as dark and creepy as it gets, but other than that.. OK maybe this should have been four stars.  :)"}
{"text":"Believe the hype, because it's all that and then some. The food is killer, the service is the perfect blend of knowledgeable, hip, and attentive (sit with Pete, I promise you will be thrilled), and the atmosphere is unlike anything nearby. If any spot has any hope of truly becoming a downtown success story, this is it.    I just hope that enough of the foodie community will venture into what suburbanites view as the mean streets of \"downtown.\"  Or that enough of the non-foodie locals will find things to love.    There is a lot to love at the Local, but I have a hard time thinking about anything but the marrow bones. If you're not familiar with the lure of the marrow, just give it a try.  And ask for the shot of Jameson's that those in the know chase it with.  Seriously.  There's nothing bad on this menu, to eat or to drink."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour before an event downtown. I was really excited when I saw their menu and website, so I was looking forward to trying it. I was impressed with the atmosphere of the restaurant and the host and server were both really friendly. Granted, when I arrived there was only one other table sat so I probably got some extra attention. Their happy hour prices are good. Only four beers on tap. A wide range of wine and cocktails though. We tried three items off the happy hour menu, pig ear pad Thai, market salad, and bone marrow. I really wanted the octopus so we ordered that too. The presentation was beautiful, but the octopus itself was just a touch fishy. I didn't think prices were that bad though I've read reviews that complain about them. I guess I'm used to higher prices in exchange for pretty food. I docked a star for lack of beers on tap, and I have to say I didn't care for the pig ear pad Thai. The pig ears were too crunchy."}
{"text":"I had the bone marrow and duck confit. Food was amazing, drinks superb, service friendly and atmosphere dripping with cool while not being stuffy at all. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while on a walk uptown.  Friendly people, nice atmosphere.  Who can go wrong with delicious $2 tacos?"}
{"text":"Paid to $$ to be part of a 90's pub crawl-supposed to include free cover and drink specials--but Local didn't honor that and tried to charge us cover anyway!!! What a rip off!! didn't go in now and won't ever give it the chance!"}
{"text":"Okay.  So I wouldn't normally give a loungey trendy downtown PHX restaurant 4 stars however, I was impressed.  By far the best dish I had was the pork belly.  Now I know that pork belly is trendy and a lot of restaurants have it now.  I'm guilty of ordering it at all those restaurants.  I will put myself out there and say this pork belly dish is the best I've had yet.  Don't take my word for it just try it.  Chill atmosphere and great food.  Well worth the visit and I will come back."}
{"text":"The Local is a great little bar. It is a little divey but still a great place grab a beer and has quite a few TVs. The prices are pretty good and the food is definitely above average for a bar.   I got the tacos and a side of sweet potato tots. The tacos were a little soupy but had great flavor and I would definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"Really exited to try out this place, we're new to Charlotte and have seen it a lot on yelp and heard good things. Sadly they definitely lost two potential customers due to their service. We ordered take out and the estimated time was 7:19 we arrived a little later than that and the order still wasn't ready. No biggie. We waited it out, but then 30min later nothing new so we complained and asked about our order. The waitress took forever to get back to us and when she did an hour had passed by and she told us our order had been stolen. Later when asking to speak to the manager he was rude for starters and then when told about the waiter letting us know the order was stolen it was a complete lie and there was never any order placed. For a restraunt to keep a customer waiting for longer than an hour is unacceptable.. This place needs to get better people in charge or trained better. You lost two potential customers that would've loved to waste their money on your establishment. Hopefully your services doesn't scare away more food fanatics."}
{"text":"First visit & fell in love. You must go & order the bone marrow it was sooooo incredible. We also tried the gnocchi which was delicious. Great spot for late night eats or happy hour. Luke is the bartender & makes fab drinks! Can't wait to go back and try the fried quail."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night and was very impressed with the ambiance, food and service.  We were well taken care of by the wait staff and the chef/ owner even came out to discuss the food with us. The Gnocchi  with Tomato Jam was amazing. Our entrees were equally as fantastic. I've seen a number of reviews here about portion size of food. Listen folks if you want huge portions of food on the cheap - go to Applebee's. This isn't about how much food you can fit on a plate for under $10. This is a dining experience with seasonal local food on an evolving menu.  Looking forward to going back and would recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"Ambiance:   Swank, smooth, and sexy. Table areas in the back offer dark corners for snuggling, flirting, and the occasional molesting of the BF. I totally dig ambiance like this - kind of reminds me of the Merc bar, but with way better food.   Service:  On point. Our server was knowledgeable and welcoming. Chris, the Owner, introduced himself and checked in to see how we liked the food while making sure our entrees were served accordingly, since we were leisurely ordering plates here and there.   Food:  We began with the smoked salmon. Fresh and tender, just how I like it with a fine herb vin to really make the flavor pop.   Then that dang bone marrow! Hands down, was the star of the night. Perfectly seasoned with a texture that'll make your mouth melt. Wish the crostini was just a tad bit softer, but luckily, I have strong teeth. Keep in mind you'll be sharing this plate as I guarantee your friends or partner will want more bites of it.  I ordered the Orecchiette Carbonara. Fresh pasta with a unique blend and texture of alba mushrooms and peas. Although I enjoyed it, I didn't finish it because it was a bit too salty.   Overall, I can really appreciate The Local for their attention to detail and presentation. You can tell there's a lot of TLC happening back in the kitchen by the ingredients used and presentation of plates. Beautifully modern, inventive and organic. This place has substance and I'll definitely be back soon to explore more of their menu, including dessert."}
{"text":"Well I have to give it 5 stars as this is our spot. We work in Hearst tower and go to \"phils\" at least twice a week. Me my husband and our friend are frequently the only ones in the bar and we're ok with that. The food is good, the staff are friendly and the beers are cold. The only times I drag the guys away are when I want to drink wine, sorry - it's not a good spot for wine.... oh but get the mac n cheese bites and the chicken strips! Yum"}
{"text":"My wife and I went on a date to The Local and absolutely loved it! The food, service, affordability, and the atmosphere were incredible. You have to go check it out!!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 11 pm last night.  Was greeted at the door by the owner.  His manner makes you feel like a regular 30 seconds after you walk in.  The  bar was packed... didn't matter.  A server came and took our drink order while we were waiting in line at the bar, and then found us a table and brought the drinks.  Best.  Service.  Ever.    If this was the soft launch?  I can't wait to see what their future holds."}
{"text":"Cool new place on Roosevelt Row with inventive, flavorful and fresh cuisine!  Great, shaded patio, friendly service and delicious food...although the lunch portions are quite small even though they are beautifully prepared and presented.  I will definitely be back for drinks and dinner."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and the live entertainment (Courtney Lynn) that drew us in was great. I can't really comment on the decor because we sat at one table near the door and just came and went. The nacho appetizer was pretty standard- nothing to brag about, but it didn't disappoint. The Blackened Chicken Mac & Cheese was good. The sweet potato tots were amazing...try them!!! My sister and her bf got a buffalo chicken sandwich and tacos...they both seemed pleased and stated that they would be returning."}
{"text":"While the food was good, the portions are extremely small. And when I say small, they are small. For instance, the beet salad was not a salad but a tablespoon of quinoa with one small beet sliced into four spread into an arrangement on a long thin plate. Cost: $13... it should have been around $4 for this. The beer glasses were small is well. This was good for a try but I will not go back. I give the owner less than a year for business. The current model will not attract long term or repeat business."}
{"text":"I'd definitely come back here to drink.  The bartender was extremely friendly and the drinks were poured well.  I initially came in for dinner, but the full kitchen wasn't open.  The bartender was kind enough to offer some good suggestions close by."}
{"text":"I'm not even sure where to start. This place was AWFUL. No ifs ands or buts about it. This is McCarthy's under a different name.   The menu was intriguing. Not what I expected from a bar. However, the burgers were also not what I expected from a bar.  Really what does a good bar and grille need? Tasty greasy burgers and friendly service. We had neither.   We went on a worked late didn't feel like cooking evening. The bar was empty. Still service was S-L-O-W. The tortoise would have done laps around our server.   My burger was burnt. It was past well done somewhere in the land of hockey pucks. To add insult to the death of this cow, it was bland. Despite being doused in farmed in gordon foods bbq sauce it was still bland.   On to the beer. . .um since when is a beer from Wisconsin an import? Did Wisconsin just secede from the US? 1.50 for domestic draughts should include semi craft beers shipped from the land of happy cheeseheads.   Simply McCarthy's failed for a reason and without improvement it will not shock me if I see a for lease sign in the window at the Local again."}
{"text":"The food really was Exquisite! It was masterfully crafted and made with the very best of high end ingredients.    I will be Blunt and Honest as I always am.  I get more filled up eating a select few samples from Costco than I did sharing two appetizers and one lunch plate at the Local. I do note Costco Samples are NOT Exquisite and I do prefer exquisite food.  I enjoyed the different fresh flavors of what they called a Roman Style Gnocchi. I read that it's made with semolina flour but if I were to name and guess what this dish was to me it almost seemed like a Polenta Lasagna with a very sweet slow cooked tomato sauce. To me it was very interesting and very layered I tasted many different components. I enjoyed it. My husband felt very different and I think he was in a bad mood. I won't share what he said. ( $10.00 )  We both enjoyed the Grilled Cauliflower very much. The Cauliflowers were roasted with crispy ends just like I make them and I never tasted cooked radishes that tasted that good. Everything on that plate harmonized well. (There just wasn't much of it. ( $12.00 )  I was wrong not to say something about the Seared Tuna Nicoise ($16.00) I think it was missing the Calabrian Chili Oil that it desperately needed.(An opening Hiccup ) But after taking a bite I had almost nothing left so it didn't seem to be logical to say anything. This dish was beautiful in appearance. For a moment I forgot where I was and was thinking Binkley's. The fish was fresh but what I tasted was a little bland and flat. I do note this dish came with an exceptionally good prepared 1/2 egg and crisp and creamy fingerling potatoes.  I enjoyed the restaurant where the chef/owner worked before so I thought I'd enjoy the local. I did enjoy most of the food but it's not enough to return to leave hungry again. At the moment I'm wondering what did they do with that other 1/2 of egg?  2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Walk in the door and it's seat your self. The place was dead but the server had no time for us. The short Indian chick with the tattoos is the rudest waitress I've encountered while in Charlotte.  On second thought the  rudest I've ever encountered. Do not come here."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Sports/dive bar/arcade games with hip hop music  Shame on me for assuming an old fashioned with be good at a dive bar. It could have been way better. They didn't have any quality maraschino cherries or a big rock.   The local beers on tap and service was good. Good night out with friends, not necessarily a date spot."}
{"text":"The food was good.  Terrible service!  If you get a server named Chad, just leave.  He was awful.  And bartender was pretty bad too.  Poured weak drinks and didn't mix them very well."}
{"text":"Great inexpensive, casual food.  Recommend the nachos or tacos. Taco Tuesday is a popular night, so get there early.  The atmosphere is dive bar, but the food and staff bring it."}
{"text":"This was my gf and my first bar we checked out when moving to Charlotte. This establishment has a great atmosphere with helpful, friendly staff that was attentive to our dining and drinking needs. We ordered the nachos and big Phil (philly steak sandwich) which was decent for bar food, but by no means mind blowing. With little sample size of other places we have visited to compare to here in Charlotte, I would still definitely recommend visiting it as it delivers a worthwhile, chill experience that would be a perfect hang out spot with friends."}
{"text":"If I could leave this place 0 stars I would! Went to this place for taco Tuesday. The next day was charged almost 50 dollars on top of the 30 they already charged from the night before. I called to try and get my money back. Long story short it's been two months and I still haven't gotten my money back. I won't ever be back. I don't care how good their tacos are."}
{"text":"My husband & I had a little time to kill before starting our evening in Charlotte, so we walked to one of the only open bars near our hotel to get a drink and a small bite. It seems like most places are closed between 2pm & 5pm in this area so we were happy to see the doors open.   There were only a few other patrons sitting at the bar, so we grabbed a small table in the bar area. Our waitress was friendly & brought us out a decent pair of bourbon diets. The only real issue was the menu was apparently outdated. 1/2 the stuff we asked for they no longer had. It was a bit confusing, but we settled for the pretzel bites with warm pimento cheese. It was definitely frozen & microwaved.   Not a place I would go back to, but at the time our options were slim."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Walked in and was immediately judged for how my friend and I looked (I had a pinup dress on and my friend had jeans and a cute top on) nothing extremely odd. We stood by the door waiting to be sat for almost a good minute or two while the staff socialized with guests. One gentleman walked over to us and stared us down and told us we can sit wherever. He handed us menus and walked away and stood by the bar talking to the bartender about us as he stared. Talk about being uncomfortable. I gave it a chance my friends recommended it but never will My friend and I step foot in  this establishment again."}
{"text":"This place was actually a decision we made to try based on the fact that they have a deal for $30 for $15 on the yelp app! So glad we did try it as we have been back several times since then! They have a really tasty black bean burger that I have grown rather attached too I must say. Its made in house and has so much flavor! I have also had the nachos that you can choose your typical proteins on but I have always opted for avocado instead. My guy has typically gotten the black bean burger as well and had a regular beef burger once that he said he also liked just as much. Drink specials are the usual that you would see at most bars although I do feel like I got a better pour here than I have other places which obviously is a huge win for anyone that likes to have adult beverages!  The service has always been awesome every time we have come and we have sat at the bar and at a regular high top table. Parking is wellllll its uptown so its either awesome or a total nightmare and will always depend on what time you go, but go you should as this is a must in my book!"}
{"text":"I'd like to preface this review by saying I've had many successful nights here at trivia or late night, and I've also had a successful lunch here.   Because of that successful lunch, I planned a lunch here with old coworkers as I thought it'd be a great casual spot with super good food. 4 of us arrived right at noon and ordered as most people had a 1 o'clock meeting. 2 of us ordered wings, 1 ordered mac and cheese, and the other ordered a french dip. The rest of the 5-6 people arrived shortly after and placed their orders. As 1 began to come closer those people who had 1 o clock meetings asked for their meals to be packed up to go and try to cash out. 1 person was able to successful accomplish this, and 1 person was overcharged but wasn't able to address it as the employees were starting to get super annoyed as there was a full restaurant and nobody had food. The third first round orderer did end up getting his food, but mine was nowhere in sight. Eventually at 1 we received a stack of to go orders. 3 of the meals placed on our table were not ours so I returned them and I never received my order. I ended up cancelling mine and leaving empty handed as it somehow got lost in translation.  I'm really sad writing this but after we left a few of my old colleagues told me the employees checking them out were really rude to them. Nobody apologized to me about my order getting lost. I was really excited to find a cheaper and decent lunch spot but I think after today I won't be able to come back :(."}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience we had tonight.  Just settled in after an amazing meal.  Rarely do I walk away with so many \"oohs\" and \"aahs\" from my man, but he couldn't stop talking about the food.  Like him, I feel like everything was so lively and bright and fresh.  So perfect and delicious.  We started with the ceviche, something not on their menu... but it was served with fried plantains.  Boy was it fresh and delicious... had a little nip of curry in there.  For my main course I had the Sea Bass, which was perfectly cooked and had a delicious seared crust on top.  It was on top of a tasty quinoa and was surrounded by fantastic veggies and a puree of something, I can't recall.  B got the oxtail ravioli.  His first bite had him with his eyes closed and making a yummy sound.  I tried one.  Oh wow!  Delicious.  Very rich, but very right.  The broth accompanying it was so perfect.  We ended with the rosemary waffles, which were very tasty, but I think would've been even better with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Really hoping this place does well.  Good vibe, good food, great service.  The space is even better than when it was Scratch.  Very pleased with everything.  Glad they had at least 2 options for local wines too.  Best thing is, it's right down the street.  This is definitely a place to impress your friends."}
{"text":"Bicycled there for a mid-evening light meal and split two starters and a good whiskey.  Friendly knowledgeable staff, timely service, decent whiskey selection. perfectly roasted beets, excellent medley of smoked fish. One quibble - the quinoa bed for the roasted beet salad was a bit tartly vinagary for our taste.  There are a few more items we'd like to try."}
{"text":"Wow!!! We are at first Friday downtown Phx. We were pleasantly surprised. Great new restaurant. The bar area is very cool and the food is amazing. I would have never tried roasted bone marrow but after talking with the chef Chris and was it the best choice yes it was. The house favorite Roman style gnocchi was incredible!!! Great Service and great food."}
{"text":"Thank you Chef Chris for an amazing experience of delicious cuisine.  The presentation was exquisite and your passion definitely shows. The best part is that we ate at midnight....who serves such mouth watering dishes?  THE LOCAL!! They actually serve until 2AM for all the late night snackers. This is my new favorite place downtown!! The staff is very efficient, professional and you can tell they love working there."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is amazing and the service was awesome.   We had the Gnocchi appetizer which was good, not great. It was one large dumpling rather than small ones. Also, it was $10, which for a small appetizer isn't bad but it was much smaller than we anticipated.  I had the Ox Tail tortellini which was simply the best tortellini I have ever had in my life. It was A-MA-ZING. Complex and powerful. The pasta was perfectly al-dente and the filling and sauce were explosive. My complaint? for $19 I should have gotten more than 6 tortellinis.  My companion had the dinner salad which he loved, the presentation was awesome and it was flavorful. Yet again, for $15 it was way too small.  We each had a dessert, the chocolate flourless tort with a custard and bacon and peanut butter ice cream. The chocolate tort part was outstanding, probably one of the best. The custard was kind of flat and bland and the bacon peanut butter ice cream was inedible. It had the consistency of congealed bacon fat on the tongue and the peanut butter over powered the bacon flavor.   The menu is full of complex and different choices. \"Pollen\" and \"dust\" are used more than once in the descriptions. This place is for the adventurous.   All in all a very good meal, we had two drinks and a beer in addition to the above for a little less than $100. Which brings me to the detractors.  For a $100 dinner I should not have to stop at the taco truck on the way home for Super Mega Nachos (not to say I wouldn't anyway but I shouldn't have to). The portions were so amazingly small I am getting hungry thinking about it.  Plan on either spending double what I did or stopping for a burger on the way home.   This place is a real risk for the area, I am not 100% certain Roosevelt can support this type of experience. I hope it goes well but I am suspect."}
{"text":"Quick service, fresh and delicious food. Great for a quick bite. Also, great deals if you catch them."}
{"text":"Good happy hour deals and casual environment. The $2 tacos were great and best part of the meal . The meltdown Mac n cheese was ok but would've been better had it had a lot of melted stringy cheese and diced jalapeños in it. Limp is was excellent - not greasy and great flavor"}
{"text":"As someone who grew up in central Phoenix, I've watched downtown really come up! We tried The Local this past weekend, after hearing great reviews. Location, decoration, and people watching A+++ with a super cool wait staff! We were cheerfully greeted by several employees and even though we were only stopping in to for dessert, they were very attentive and didn't just leave us sitting in some corner. The menu looked amazing, and so did the drink specials! My only complaint, would be menu pricing. I hate to say that hip&trendy comes at steep price? I think what makes downtown Phoenix appealing is that it's not overproduced, overpriced, and over the top. I'll be back for dinner and drinks, happy to have you in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Came for trivia night-and we will be coming back! It was a fun and relaxed vibe. I really liked that the staff seemed happy to be there and to be enjoying themselves.   I ordered my typical \"one of everything\" from the $5 happy hour appetizer list. The bartender was a bit surprised but also amused. I guess people don't do the appetizers all that seriously here?  We also got several of the $4 wines which were the individual mini-bar-sized bottles of Sutter Home wines poured into stemless glasses (seemed like large red glasses rather than sized for the whites we ordered, if you want to be picky about it). I would have been fine to drink from the bottle, given the causal atmosphere and the smudgy glasses. No lipstick marks on the rims, though, so all good.   There were 7 appetizers: hush puppies, mozzarella sticks, fried pickle slices (not spears), pretzel bites, spicy mac and cheese bites, nachos, and pork sliders-in order of most to least enjoyed.   The hush puppies had a lovely onion flavor and were served with what seemed like a melted honey butter. The combination of sweet and savory was perfect and the texture was nice: crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. The mozzarella sticks had all of the cheese leaked out of at least half of them, but I am just a sucker for mozzarella sticks every time. You may want to avoid if you are less of a cheese fanatic than I am. I liked the fried pickle slices because this was a new thing for me. Fun and juicy with a soft batter and a side of ranch. Probably would have preferred zucchini slices or mushrooms or cauliflower, but it was cool to do once. I'm generally not a huge fan of pretzels but they were in these nicely salted little bite sized pieces and came with a tiny side of slightly gritty beer cheese dipping sauce. Despite the questionable quality of the cheese, we did run out of it. I'd recommend ordering a second cup of the dipping sauce. This was actually the same cheese that was used on the nachos, similar grainy, mealy quality. But I digress. The mac and cheese bites weren't balls but short strips of Mac and cheese dipped in batter and deep fried. The cheese was a pepper jack so had a bit of a kick to it. It was served with the same ranch as the pickles so that fatty cool helped offset the spice. The nachos, aside from the beer cheese, were pretty generic. Only enough toppings (lettuce and tomato) to cover 1/3 of the chips, sour cream and pico in tiny little cups that can't be accessed by the chips (and no silverware to get them out of cups and onto nachos) so this dish ended up being a pretty big bust for us. Similarly with the sliders-the pork just didn't have any flavor and the cole slaw on it was disgusting. Luckily, there were three sliders and three people so no one had to go back for seconds. No one wanted to, either   The trivia was fun. I really enjoyed that each round had a different theme, although some themes were more fun (movies that start with the letter M) than other themes (elementary school knowledge-only applies to people who grew up in a specific time range...). I'd definitely do it again, but bring a offer group next time!"}
{"text":"You know \"local\" is a lame marketing cliche that's ran it's course when they start painting over crap hole green bars (like McCarthy's)  and hanging some micro/craft brew signs up and think it's going to fool someone. OVER!"}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot!  I was pleasantly surprised because i expected generic bar food.  They had really good sandwich options...it was hard to choose.  I got the Pepper jack macaroni bites, which were delicious.  I also got the Queen Dip (French Dip) but with really good caramelized onions.  It came with a side of sweet potato tots (get the honey mustard with them!!)  All in all a good choice.  My friends Buffalo chicken grilled cheese also looked solid."}
{"text":"Love this place! My friend brought us here on Sunday during halftime of Panthers/Seahawks, unfortunately where we were prior to this was not a good experience. But The Local totally made up for it! It's a cute little bar, kind of like a hole in the wall bar but so cozy and welcoming. Compared to other places we had stopped at, we got a table right away, right in front of a tv so we could watch the game.   There was a great mix of people inside, all different ages which made the experience a lot of fun! Our waitress came up to us right away and asked for our drink orders. They came out fast and we ordered our food right away as well. Again, service was super fast for a busy Sunday, playoff football game. I got the chicken salad melt, so yummy! They carved out a onion roll and put the chicken salad in it like a bowl, melted some american cheese on top and added thousand island dressing, which I thought was weird at first but after tasting it, was very content! It came with chips, macaroni salad, or pasta salad. I chose chips even though after I kinda wished I went with one of the salads, oh well, next time! My boyfriend got wings with mild sauce on the side. He mentioned he was glad he got it on the side because it was super spicy, but enjoyed them regardless! We also got a side of the buffalo macaroni and cheese, ughhh I love anything buffalo and I cannot go somewhere without trying the different buffalo dishes they have so this obviously was a must. It was soooo good. It was super cheesy and had just the right amount of kick to it, perfectly spiced buffalo flavor!   All the employees were super friendly along with all the customers that were there. It made our experience so much more enjoyable. We'll definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"The worse ever.  Sat for 20 minutes no service. Watched the server and bartender walk around...never to return."}
{"text":"Awesome drink list! I loved my Lambert-Gini martini!! Tim was swell behind the bar! Loved everything about this place. Can't wait to come back and try the roasted bone marrow!!!"}
{"text":"My first experience was a call in order. I showed up after 15 minutes and had to wait nearly an hour due to a surprise health inspector visit that took priority. To settle this, they gave me a $8 voucher for a meal at a later date. I used the voucher months later, and I ordered the California Wrap to go. It was supposed to have bacon, but it definitely did not.   Food quality itself - nondescript really. This place might be good for one quick drink when other spots are crowded, but it doesn't really have any unique offerings or a welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Their Taco Tuesday special is legit. That's all I can really speak for. Sometimes when you and your roomateboyfriend work in the service industry you don't eat dinner at 10pm. We've been eyeing the taco Tuesday special at The Local for a while and finally tried it out last week after a long day. They have several types of tacos for $2 each. We ordered a couple of the chicken each. They were larger than expected and really delicious. The vibe in there was awesome, they already had someone DJing, but it wasn't overpowering for people having a late dinner. The bartender was awesome and very friendly. I think his name was Will but theres a 75% chance I completely made that up. They are always advertising really good looking specials so we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here it's amazing the staff is friendly and prompt. I tried the wings the cheerwine BBQ wings are delicious along with the Korean BBQ tacos. And the fries are the best I've tried anywhere. You definitely have to try this spot."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks and great DJ (plays top 40 and EDM). They also have darts to entertain yourselves if you don't like bobbing to the music. But the crowd here on a Friday night is what you can expect in uptown- pretentious college students/finance folks. I really wanted to like this place, wish there were more down to earth folks rather than D-bags."}
{"text":"There is nothing else like this in Uptown Charlotte! Laid back, fun, great food (lunch, dinner, happy hour, late night AND brunch!!), amazing drink specials and a phenomenal staff! And who doesn't love trivia, karaoke and live music!?"}
{"text":"I didn't come here to eat, but to drink.   The Local is hip!  You get carafes of water with your order...whether you ask for it or not.   This place is stylish.   The music is great and just the right volume to enjoy it while you socialize. It's way aesthetic, and a good place to spend a night on the patio with your friends...and maybe even people-watch on a First Friday.   Most importantly, the staff, including the guy at the door are freaking nice. I will return."}
{"text":"Visited the local for the first time and really wasn't impressed. The menu had a lot of options but service was lacking! My friend ordered the sunset wrap and it wasn't properly made. The server served it without the avocado. My friend realized it didn't have avocado and spoke with the server. The server said \"oh we just ran out\" but never confirmed this with my friend or asked if she wanted to change her meal. It wasn't very service oriented and the server should have informed us right away the kitchen couldn't make a simple wrap that was on the menu. Instead of comping the meal due to her mistakes she gave us a whopping 1.50 discount for the meal. I guess she didn't want to involve management. We tried this place due to convenience and close to work but will never return."}
{"text":"5 stars after one visit? You betchya! Lovely space.  Clean and open. The drink menu.  Oh that drink menu.  I made a dent but will continue to work my way down that list.  The saying \"each one better than the last\" is woefully inadequate.  Each one is AMAZING.  Really! These cocktails are creative and beautifully crafted. That should be the theme of this spot. Food and drinks alike. Creative and beautifully crafted. That says it all. The food was equally impressive, if not more so.  Tonight I had the roasted bone marrow starter.  Savory, gelatinous.  With a duck bacon than cave such a wonderful spice on some toasted bread.  And a lovely arugula salad that was tangy and provided a wonderful contrast to the fatty marrow. Also had the quail.  Really great.  Crispy but not over cooked or died out. Oh.  And it came with smoked whiskey butter. Yeah, read that again: Smoked. Whiskey. Butter. That, thanks to The Local, is now a thing that exists outside of your dreams."}
{"text":"The meal was wonderful! There pork ribs have a succulent sauce and they are tender and crispy. The wings are just the right amount of spiciness and melt in your mouth.  Of course the marrow bone is cooked to perfection and the lamb bacon is a perfect touch.  They have a Roman Polenta Gnocci which is a beautiful sight to behold and even better to eat.  Then there is the service...wow, every time we have gone there we have been greeted and treated like VIP's. All of the staff are great and know how to give you just the right amount of attention. I can't even describe the deserts because they so unique and yummy! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The gf really liked this place, she said it really remind her of a dive bar with great company and enthusiastic bartenders. There was no cover charge on the Saturday night we went and the drinks were averagely priced. A few game machines feel the place and a decent DJ spins on the tables. Simply put, if your bar hoping feel free to step in and have a drink."}
{"text":"Decent drop-in for a drink or two place.  Vibe tends to be more casual and not as noisy (although they do have a DJ Fri/Sat late night) than some of the surrounding places.  You pay typical Uptown prices for your booze which can be a bit higher than the rest of CLT but that's to be expected.  I think I've only had food here once and it was nothing special but as other reviews suggest might be worth checking out especially if you do a coupon/Groupon.  No rock star bartenders but never had an issue with the staff.  I think the name of the place is a bit cheesy (didn't Jon Taffer suggest this name for one of his Bar Rescue places?) but overall no major complaints.  A better than average Uptown bar."}
{"text":"NOTE:  This is a review of the food, eaten during dinner time.  To a review of the atmosphere and libations served during \"bar\" hours, look else where.  This is the old McCarthy's...  The menus still say so, the charge on your credit card will say so.  This place is a pit.  Obviously serving food is not their primary concern.    The wife and I were out and about on one of those \"we don't want to cook\" nights and saw that McCarthy's was sporting a new name and was now called \"The Local.\"  We decided to stop in and give it a shot, figuring that a new name might mean new and better food.  No one seems to work at this place.  After walking in the door, we had to seat ourselves, and after sitting looking around for help for more than five minutes, a girl at the bar pries her (personal) cellphone away from her head for long enough to tell us that she'll be \"right over.\"  Another five minutes pass and the bartender finishes up her call, and comes over.  She informs us that it is \"Happy Hour\" and pints of domestic draughts are $1.50.  We both order Leinenkugel Summer Shandy.  When she comes back with the beers, she also has menus.  Emblazoned at the top is \"McCarthy's,\" the name of the old establishment.  My heart sunk to the floor.  Looking over the menu I expected to see greasy bar food, instead I saw a menu put together by someone obviously more concerned about \"flexing culinary muscles\" and paying off student loans than preparing ambiance-appropriate food.  Since it was too late to bail, we both ordered burgers.  She ordered some western burger (you know the drill, cheese, bacon, barbeque sauce) and I ordered a southern/mexican themed burger (jalapenos and black bean and corn salsa).  The burgers come with a side of fries, which while decent were not enough to redeem the awfulness that was presented to us.  My medium-rare burger was cooked to shit on one half (think 12 to 6 on the face of an analog clock) and almost raw on the other half (6 to 12).  Did the chef decide to only put half of the meat over the fire?  Worse yet, it was BLAND.  It takes real skill (or lack thereof) to cook with jalapeno peppers and end up with bland food.  The wife's burger didn't get much better reviews from her.  The bacon was gross, and the barbeque sauce was shopped in, rather than homemade.  Oh yeah, and the burgers were TINY...  barely a quarter pound, and the prices were $8-10 each.  We finally get the check, and this ghastly meal has set us back close to $30 before the tip...  Oh yeah, and Leinenkugel, brewed and distributed by a company owned and operated in Chippewa Falls, WISCONSIN is apparently NOT A DOMESTIC BEER?!? !  You might make an argument a few years ago that it was a craft/micro brew but in today's marketplace, you can find Leinenkugel beers at just about every watering hole.  It is certainly mainstream, and domestic.  Needless to say, there is no reason for us to ever return to this culinary abortion.  The prices are too high, the quality too low, and the \"Happy Hour\" specials left us feeling anything but happy.  Take your business to any of the many other pubs and bars in Lakewood where they know how to make an honest cheeseburger."}
{"text":"I want to love the local, and I'll probably go back (since it's local and open late), but I've never been blown away by a meal here.  The atmosphere is hip but comfortable- in addition to the patio, the dimly lit restaurant is divided into two halves:  a lounge, where there are bars and cushy seating, and the dining side, where the are a handful of tables and high-backed chairs.  The staff is friendly and service is perfectly fine.  The cocktail and wine menus both present lots of good and reasonably priced options, with rotating featured cocktails to spice things up a bit.  On our first trip, our server recommended a fantastic bottle of Pinot Noir that wasn't on the menu, which we greatly enjoyed.  As for the food, I've been on two occasions and sampled a variety of dishes:  the heirloom cauliflower prepared two ways (once with lemon and cumin, the second time with cumin eggplant puree), pigs ear pad thai, bone marrow with lamb bacon, chicken fried quail with aged white cheddar and poblano biscuit, lemon poppyseed cake with avocado ice cream and lavender meringue, the cookie bar, chicken wings, bolognese tagliatelle, and grilled octopus and pork belly.  Some of the dishes are real hits, but others are near or total misses.  Oftentimes, this imbalance occurs in a single dish.    For instance, the grilled octopus was perfectly cooked, flavorful, and tender, but its accompanying pork belly was a tad dry.  The sauces did little to complement the dish and their flavors were too muted to accent it.  The chicken fried quail was tender, moist, and lightly but flavorfully battered, but the aged white cheddar and poblano biscuit paired with it lacked any poblano spice, had very little cheddar flavor, and was dry.  The chicken wings' smoky flavor was overpowering such that they couldn't be finished.  The pigs ears in the pad thai were perfectly cooked, but their flavor and much of their texture, along with the flavors one typically associates with pad thai, were lost in the bland dish.  The slices of peppers provided the only spice and the dish was dominated by the crunch and taste of bean sprouts.  The bolognese tagliatelle was decent, but primarily saved by the fantastic whipped mascarpone atop it.  I'll take a plate of that next time and skip the bolognese sauce, which overwhelmed the delicate tagliatelle.  (Was it properly cooked?  It's hard to tell under all of that meat sauce.  Or maybe that's the point?)  Lamb bacon is a delightful idea, but the gamey-richness of lamb was entirely lost in the crumbled bacon bits, although the bone marrow and and accompanying grilled, olive-oil drizzled crostini were lovely.  The heirloom cauliflower would be a perfect dish except that, on my first visit, it was too lemony and, on my second, the cumin in the sauce overpowered the vegetable, which, along with the blistered radishes, is so beautiful and well-prepared, you wish the kitchen would let it shine through.   The desserts are the only part of the meal that seem consistent - on both trips they ended my meal on a high note.  The lemon poppyseed cake was perfectly moist and the rich avocado ice cream and delicate lavender meringue were delightful accompaniments.  The cookie bar, filled with melted chocolate and served with cinnamon ice cream, was rich and delicious.  In other words, definitely don't skip dessert.    I'll continue to support The Local because, well, it's local, keeps late hours, and the menu, which features rotating items and daily specials, has great potential.  I'm a huge fan of Atlas, where The Local's chef previously produced great dishes.  And, on each visit, I'll maintain high hopes the Local will impress me this time."}
{"text":"Great lil bar with a divey feel. Burgers are awesome, well rounded beer selection, and nifty mixed drinks"}
{"text":"I went here for restaurant week. We had just about everything on the menu, and every dish exceeded our expectations. I loved everything, but the pork belly was my favorite. The octopus and bone marrow are also two don't miss dishes. This was a true culinary experience. Tim our server was awesome, and everyone from the hostess to the owner we incredibly helpful and friendly. I travel to the area on business often, and will make a point to come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was only able to sample a cocktail, so that is why I am giving it a three so far.  I would need to try the food next.  The cocktail menu was fun, and the quality was great.  The atmosphere was hip but still a little casual.  It's in a strip mall with another restaurant, so it was fun to semi-bar hop between the two.  I would recommend checking this place out :)"}
{"text":"Went in to grab a drink before a play.   The bar was not busy, maybe 5 people.  I sat at the bar, two bartenders chatting as if I was not there.  They did not say hello, can i get you something...Nothing.    I waited 5-7 minutes while they were having a personal conversation.   I had to interrupt their chat to get service.   Just sad!!  Pass this BAR.  The have no clue on what customer service is.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Great dive bar in the center of town. The food was above average bar food and Sara and Sean were great servers. We went back the next day following the Packers game and stayed to watch the late NFL game. Lots of local people having fun."}
{"text":"Pretty cool bar.  Came on trivia night and won an appetizer. Had a great time. Enjoyed a few drinks and played trivia.  Decent happy hour specials for drinks and food."}
{"text":"Came here as part of a bar crawl. Didn't stay too long and will never return. Customer service is the reason why I will never return.  There was about 6 of us in my close group. And we came here earlier than the mass group due to the prior bar being too packed.  4 of us approached the bar at the same time. The bartender served only 2 of us- me and my boyfriend. He then begins to take other people's drink order. I'm thinking he was going to bounce back and serve my friends. Nope. I tell him that he skipped my friends and that they still haven't been helped. There is a pillar at the bar and they were at the corner of the bar so I wasn't sure if it was an honest oversight. He then tells another patron \"I'm pretty sure I know how to do my job\" and still doesn't serve them 6 people later (I counted). The bar back then came out the back and served my friends.   Drinks were terrible. I'm not sure if they were skimping to save money due to the bar crawl occurring or figured people would be drunk already but geez. I got a redbull and vodka. I'm a lightweight my drink tasted watered down. My friend got some type of drink, not sure what it was but when I tasted it, it tasted like sweet and sour mix. Unfortunately, the staff didn't remake the drinks or offer any explanation."}
{"text":"I went to the Local tonight with the husband to celebrate my birthday (just the two of us). I must say, it was pretty awesome. The decor looks similar to when it was Scratch, but they moved the bar and got new furniture. It looks nice. The service was great, attentive and informative. We ordered a bunch of things to share including the pig ear pad thai, the gnocchi, and the brisket. The gnocchi was good, but nothing crazy amazing. It is one large gnocchi.... it had the consistency of a souffle almost and tasted good, but I don't think it's worth the 10$ price tag. The pad thai, on the other hand, was amazing! It had so much flavor, it was tangy, spicy, savory, but mostly it tasted extremely fresh. I loved every bite....yum. The brisket was also good, but a little on the fatty side (I know that's kind of the nature of brisket, but the way it was cut left a lot of fat on). The sauce was delicious and complemented the meat well. It was herby, a little citrusy, and tasted great. It came with brussels sprouts (which were nicely cooked and tasty), potatoes (which were cheesy , but nothing too special), and amazing onions... these onions were fabulous, not oniony....very sweet. They were unbelievable. Lastly, we had the chocolate tart.... this was a tasty dessert, but they should probably call it a peanut butter dessert...the peanut butter taste was far stronger than the chocolate, which you could barely taste at all. Despite this, it was a tasty dessert. I definitely would like to come back here to try their brunch and the other items on their menu.  Update: I have been back to the Local a couple times and it definitely has some highs and lows. The pig ear pad thai is consistently good. I have had drinks here a couple times and they are also good. I had a drink on their new happy hour when I went recently that was very tasty (I can't remember what it was called, but it was fruity with a touch of mint and was topped with a huge piece of citrus skin) and it was a decent deal at 6$ on special. We also had the brisket sliders (on our slider tour of phoenix) and I must say that they were ok, but nothing special. I wouldn't order them again. Further, the last time I went here, the service was terrible (incredibly slow, inattentice) and the DJ was playing music so loud, I couldn't even hear a conversation. I hope they can work out the kinks because it would be a nice place to catch happy hour."}
{"text":"Taco Tueadays; buy one get one free (beef tacos are $2 chicken $3, fish $4.. So they're already cheap lol). I still come on other days for the tacos bc they're so good. Also, everyday they've got great drink specials. Great service as well. The only thing I hate is that it's always maybe too chill, probably because no one is aware of how great a hidden gem it is."}
{"text":"Love this spot, my favorite part is the staff! Every time I come here the door guy with a beard is always friendly and does an amazon job. If you ask me this guy needs a raise!!"}
{"text":"Extremely small portions. We ordered the Roman gnocchi and it came in a bowl with literally a one gnocchi. $10 for a single gnocchi. The server told us it would be cheaper to buy a bottle of wine and after the fact we looked at the menu and it would nave ended up $7 cheaper if we went by the glass. The food was indeed good and I like that it is local but the portions were so small we went to a food truck after."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is going to be a star to be reckoned with, 5 Stars for Service, Food, Value and of course...genius!   Last night we had the chance to partake in the sampling of menu dishes that were passed around to the guests, my 11 year old twins . We were welcomed at the entrance with genuine friendliness and given the rules of engagement for the event; a complimentary celebratory glass of Prosecco concoction that I wish I would have paid attention to so I could try to repeat it on my own...I'll just have to go back and try it again! I later had an Italian Summer with a dry Lavender Soda & Rosemary, dangerous :-)  Then there were passed samplings of menu items in just right portions to enjoy them all!  We enjoyed most the Grilled Pork Head Cheese Bahn Mi so tender, with a perfectly scrumptious sriracha aioli! My kids devoured it! The Chicken Fried Quail served with 2 delicate dipping sauces, one mildly sweet the other with just the right amount of spice. We also had the Beet Risotto, Crispy Pig Ear Pad Thai, Pork Riblets with Coconut Rice, each worth having again and again. Thankfully, my kids know how to be mindful in of others, or they would have eaten every single Smoked Salmon Potatoe Rosti w/creme Fraiche!   Lastly for sweets we had a reinvented \"Strawberry Rhubarb Newton\" that I would buy by the dozen to add to our lunch boxes., daily, maybe even have them for breakfast with a yogurt! The grand finale was the Flourless Chocolate Cake with Peanut Butter Mouse and Bacon ice cream!!! Orgasm for the taste-buds! Ooohs and aahs, eyes rolling in a state of, \"I can't believe this is so delicious!\" state of pure rapture.You must try it when you go...  The service exemplified genuine hospitality, my kids commented on \"how nice everyone\" was. Our server Katie was friendly and acknowledged my kids directly, I always appreciate that. Everyone we came in contact with was open and courteous, big smiles and helpful.  Chef Chris  & his partner Adam have out done themselves! This place is a gem! We will be back, sit at the chef bar to watch genius in action. My kids said, \"this is my new favorite place!\" Yes folks my kids are foodies and if we were closer to downtown, I'd be in trouble!  The environment is snazzy but unpretentious, totally chill! It's a must! Go enjoy downtown and find your way to The Local! You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I'll start out with saying I have eating here several times and have tried almost every item on the menu. The staff is friendly and knowledgable and the owner stops by to check on our food every time I have been in. I would recommend going with a friend and sharing everything so you can try more items. My favorites are the Pig Ear, Grilled romain heart, and smoked brisket."}
