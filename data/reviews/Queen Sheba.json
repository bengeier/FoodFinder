{"text":"This was a fun spot to go to with a group. We were mostly veg, so didn't get to try the meat yet- but everything was yummy with lots of selection- And when you run out of Enjera bread, they keep bringing you more until you polish it all off! Also they brought the extra portions in a separate bowl so there was sooo much food to enjoy. I have a feeling the meat would be even better. The ambiance was ok- not as cozy as I would have liked and the lighting is a little dark and night clubby while I prefer more of a La Khaima restaurant vibe but that didn't take away from the experience. Family run- really friendly service. They also serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Exceptional service, wonderful food and an overall excellent experience. 10/10 would recommend and plan on going back soon! Great recommendations by the staff to choose from the expansive menu. Cannot say enough good things about this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! The wait time can be a little lengthy so it's probably not a good place to come if you're in a rush. The prices are accurate for what you get, and they alcoholic beverages are pretty cheap. They have about 9-10 tables inside and a patio. Overall great food!"}
{"text":"Five stars for these five reasons:

1. Service: fantastic, so friendly, lovely waiter (rare in Montreal)

2. Locally run: by an awesome family who has been in the city since 1992

3. Food: top notch, incredible variation among the veggie and meat dishes. Everything so tasty, not super spicy, but just enough.

4. Atmosphere: very chill, clean, minimal and welcoming decor - not too loud.

5. Music: best jazz compilation with fab piano riffs."}
{"text":"Great food! Not only did we have a great meal but dining with a 9-year-old and 9-month-old, they were extremely helpful making sure both kids had food to eat as well. My husband (who's a bit more food traveled) said it might be the best Ethiopian he's had. We would definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurants! I'm from Los Angeles and have been so homesick without Ethiopian food. It's very authentic, flavorful, and just bomb overall!  If you're looking for a good Ethiopian restaraunt this is your go to!"}
{"text":"The food is authentic and delicious. The staff is friendly. There were many Ethiopian families enjoying the food and celebrating events it was like a great travel and food experience. I will go again for sure."}
{"text":"I love Ethiopian food, and this place d√©finetly met my expectations. The server was very friendly and helped us make a decision on what to order and it turned out perfect. The decor is very nice and cozy and best of all, the prices are right on target. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with wonderful dish platter to share.

I really enjoyed dining here. The dish platter was so unique and had it's own kick of flavour to each of the dish options. The host is friendly and, despite being the only person at the station, he was attentive in servicing throughout the meal. Definitely a place I would return to many times."}
{"text":"This place is so bad that I felt compelled to write a review the second after \"finishing\" our take out from there (I use quotes, because we certainly did not finish a single dish we ordered and only ate enough to quiet our hunger before we eventually make a second meal at home). We ordered the Ye doro wat, which is a common dish in every Ethiopian restaurant, consisting of chicken simmered in a berbere sauce and a hard-boiled egg. This dish was probably the least edible of the three we ordered, due to the sauce (which comprised 70% of the dish) being inordinately BITTER, and also tasting like burnt oil. The chicken was pretty hard and not flavorful and the egg was completely overcooked and hard to even cut in two. The next dish, yellow split peas, was one of the blandest, saddest dishes I've had the displeasure of eating recently! It was basically mashed split peas with no seasoning. Anyone who has had the chance to have good Ethiopian knows the amazingly complex spiciness simple veggie dishes can have, and this was like eating baby food. The last dish we ordered, Alitcha, was supposed to be tender meat cubes with potatoes and seasoned with various spices. I literally didn't even realize this was a meat dish when I first opened the container, since it looked like possibly pureed lentils. It was basically a greasy, oily mess of miniscule pieces of meat, and by miniscule, I mean each piece of meat resembling a morsel of ground meat in size. This dish tasted overcooked and no seasoning. Absolutely unmemorable. To top it off, we live across the street from this establishment and yet every dish was lukewarm at best. I suspect a lot of reheating going on (something you would never see at East Afrika in NDG!), hence the bitter oil taste in the meat dishes. The injera was a darker brown than I've ever experienced and so incredibly sour that even people who like sourdough would have a hard time eating this. Completely unsatisfying and sad. Please save your wallets and expectations and skip this place!"}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of my buddies on a Friday night. We made a reservation last minute and they were able to seat us quickly. I absolutely LOVED dining here. The wait staff is really polite and the ambiance is perfect for groups. They have several large tables. Plus the food was delicious, so good that we ordered seconds. I believe we had the meat platter to share- I was excited because the meat was halal. But it also had some vegetarian parts. Everything was delicious. Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We have eaten at so many different Ethiopian restaurants in different cities and this is by far my favorite. The ambience is elegant and tasteful, the service was excellent and the food Exquisite. Can't wait to go here again"}
{"text":"Came here for a quiet dinner on the patio with my girlfriend and had a very pleasant experience.

Service was a little slow for how quiet it was but the food itself was rather good and the chef came around to check on the tables that were in the restaurant and he was very nice."}
{"text":"Oh dear. 

I'm always on the lookout for new Ethiopian restaurants so I was very excited to find out about this place. I noticed Queen Sheba while walking past one day, and immediately made plans to go over the weekend. The restaurant is nice and comfortable, the location is convenient, and the staff are lovely, but unfortunatley that's where the positive review ends. 

My friend and I ordered a couple of vegetarian combos that featured typical Ethiopian fare - lentils in berber sauce, split peas, mixed veggies, spinach, etc. The first thing we noticed was that everything was dry. Normally, the sauces from the food soak through the injera, but these dishes were so dry they were honestly difficult to swallow. The fact that the injera was thicker and denser than I'm used to didn't help. The split peas were also undercooked (crunchy), so we ended up leaving most uneaten. Finally, the taste was underwhelming. Good Ethiopian food is incredible for its spice blends and bursting flavours, but this food almost seemed intentionally bland. I'm left wondering if the other reviewers have never had Ethipian food before, because I'm honestly baffled by the positivity of the previous comments. 

I hate leaving negative reviews for places that I really want to support. The people here seem wonderful and I would have loved to have found a new regular dinner spot. I only hope that my comments can be helpful in some way, because I would love for this place to succeed. Considering they have good service, a good location, and a nice sized restaurant, they really just need to improve their food in order to have a winning combination.


TL;DR: Food is dry and bland. Restaurant is nice and service is great. Wish I could have loved it. One star for the food, second star for the service and overall restaurant experience."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant. The food was some of the best Ethiopian I've ever had. Good value. The only downside: the ambiance is sterile and lacks the warmth of many Ethiopian places. So, not ideal for a romantic date; great for everything else."}
{"text":"We had not been in Montreal for a long time, and our old standby restaurants no longer exist. We came upon Queen of Sheba accidentally, and it turned out to be the best dining experience in our trip. The atmosphere was casual and relaxed. We had a vegetarian combination dish, and it was excellent. What was unique about this restaurant, though, was the exceptionally friendly and attentive service. We never had to ask or look around to get our water refilled. When the waitress asked how everything was, she seemed to really want to know. Even the chef came to our table to ask how we liked the food. When we asked what one dish was, he told us, and brought us an additional complimentary serving, since we said we liked it. We were told that the restaurant was only 4 months old. We really them the best of luck and would highly recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Very authentic Ethiopian food! The service was good! The owner personally came out and asked us how the food was. One thing that was different from what I'm used to for Ethiopian food was that the spicy level was more mild compared to what I had before. Overall it was a great experience!!"}
{"text":"The food was good and everyone was friendly, but the experience overall was mediocre. I love Ethiopian food, so I was excited to come here. I went with a very large group which might have something to do with the problems. The service was very very slow even though we appeared to be one of the few tables in the restaurant. There was a lot of confusion how much food to share and we ended up having to ordered more.

If I lived closer I would give it another try with a smaller group of people. I would also only order the vegetarian dishes (they were far superior to the meat based dishes IMO)."}
{"text":"Food was very good. See pictures. The host was friendly and attentive. Only minus right now is that they don't have desserts, but they are looking into it."}
{"text":"Wow. The most calming and enjoyable dinner place in Montreal I've been to in my four years here. The food is amazing, tons of vegetarian options, and good for sharing. The service is excellent and the whole place has just a very comforting vibe."}
{"text":"Sharing a platter of Ethiopian food with good friends is such a pleasure, but in Montreal we haven't had many affordable options, so I was thrilled to hear about Queen Sheba. 

The ambiance is wonderful--the tables are well-spaced, but cozy; the space is warm and clean and perfectly lit; there's music, but it's easy to converse. The food is terrific: generous quantities, and fresh, with just the right amount of spice. The service is really top-notch and friendly. Oh, and it's all really affordable! I'm already planning my next visit..."}
{"text":"3.5stars
I expected more out of this place.. I thought it would be more flavorful but the vegetable combo was bland. The meat (doro wat, chacha tibs, kitfo) were okay/good but the portions were really small for the price you pay. Service was kind of slow since there was only one person hosting, waitressing & cleaning but overall it was a good first time experience!"}
