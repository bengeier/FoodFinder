{"text":"Brutal how loud it is gee's and the servers dress skankey high skirts and just look trashy. Its alright inside after the renovations at least.  The food its a 1 star to.  The bands that play are alright.   I wont come back that is for sure!"}
{"text":"Our large group of ten managed to snag a booth and a table for two on Sat night to watch the Flames and Canucks game 6. Atmosphere was electric with anticipation, even a good two hours ahead puck drop!

Our server was busy with lots of patrons, but she kept up with drinks and food orders. We tried a variety of appies and mains. All good! The brisket Poutine was excellent as were the blue cheese and buffalo wings! The Carlsberg was on special which was awesome - at least at the time. Next morning, not so  much. 

The game was a crazy affair and the crowd was loud and good natured! The Canucks fans next to us were gracious in defeat. Through it all, our able server kept up! I felt badly for her as the game ended and everyone wanted to pay up and hit the Red Mile. There simply were not enough machines for the staff to clear all the tabs. Not at all the bar's fault. More a function of our nearly cashless society, but that is for another time.

All in all a great night at a great pub!"}
{"text":"Disappointing is an understatement.  

I used to meet friends at this 'pub' when it was owned by the same people who own the Joyce on 8th Avenue.  Since they have sold it, the quality and the standards have plummeted at a dizzying speed.

The service is lack luster and the food is not worth mentioning.  I was here for my birthday and we barely were served by our waitress.  The food was basic and bland.  We didn't bother to complain because there was no one to complain to - it was just a grand disappointment.  I wanted a piece of 'home' for my birthday and instead I was left feeling disturbed.  

The once beautiful pub, reminiscent of Ireland has been replaced with a 'pub' riding on the coat tails of the previous owners who had established a high standard and continue to do so at their original location.  I think it is critical that people know that these two pubs are not connected with one another anymore and that this one is just a poor addition to a poor chain of other 'Irish pubs' in this city."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour and wife and I decided to each order a bowl of soup. I had French Onion and Mrs had daily special Beef w Barley.  Mine was over the top w salt. Hers had a lot of grease visibly floating. Server was kind enough to take these off our bill as they were both pretty bad."}
{"text":"Only draft and bottles please.

The food here is not very good. I like pub food. I have no problem with pub food. But this food is awful. Steak is fatty and grisly. Everything is overly greasy, salty, flavorless.

Ordered a few well drinks here one night with a friend and twice her drinks had glass chunks in them. First time we told the staff they apologized and brought her a new one. Second time she told the staff they accused her of putting the glass from the first drink into the second drink. Just ridiculous. My friend showed the second piece of glass, the first one had been taken away with the drink it came in, and the staff looked at her and said, \"you say it was in your drink, but that's just what you are saying.\" He basically called her a liar.

My friend found the manager and told him what was going on. He apologized, got her another drink. Thank goodness at least the manager did something. Still. Neither of us will likely ever go back unless it is purely because we are meeting others there. If I do end up back at this place, unfortunate as it is such a great location, I will only ever order bottled beverages or draft."}
{"text":"Joyce is a decent pub. Not my favorite, bout it's great for a cheap breakfast on Saturday's. Saturday afternoon they also have a group of people playing live music which I enjoy very much. 

I just had the fish and chips there, which is probably a big reason for my low rating. I found it was overly oily and didn't really enjoy it. 

I have eaten really good food there though. The bacon wrapped scallops were super good. 

I would recommend this place to friends. Just don't expect fine dining or anything and you'll have a great time. 

Earls is across the street and I'd rather suck on the business end of a shotgun then go there, so it's nice that the Joyce is where it is :)"}
{"text":"Once every second week the following scenario unfolds..
 I get my eyelashes done @ Noir next door, my boyfriend waits for me here and drinks a couple beers, watches the game etc, I join him when I am done, drink a beer and then we will drive to another pub to eat.
I don't care about decor in a pub and as long as the beer is cold I will drink it but Joyce why do you have such terrible food? We ate here exactly 2 times and it just felt like they were trying to give us the cheapest food they could get away with...and it's not like the prices they charge reflect a \"cheap\" pub, it's criminal.
My boyfriend had a jalapeno burger and sweet potato fries and was still so hungry he ordered 20 wings after he was finished! I had a veggie burger and sauteed seasonal veg, I swear BOTH came right out of Safeway's freezers AND the portions were tiny as well.
If your hungry, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"such a fun place to get a drink! went with my hostel mates on a monday night and was surprised to find it so crowded (most likely because of the sports games on) so i'm glad we had reserved a table in advance. great place to watch a game because there are tv's all over the place. ALSO theres trivia on some tvs which was a lot of fun!! got 10 wings for $1.40 and the 34 oz platinum blonde beer to go along with it! enjoyed myself very much that night lol"}
{"text":"Don't expect good service at the bar. The greenday-haired bartender lives in a bubble. 
But,  they play good music and have good selection on tap."}
{"text":"We went during Stampede for a quick bite before going to the chucks.  Bad service, bad food and it was dead!!!  After our experience we weren't surprised.  

We asked the server to call us a cab, get this, she refused and said she didn't do that.  When another server brought us our cold food we asked her if she could and she politely said, \"of course, no problem\"  

The bacon was raw on our burgers and the fries were cold.  We mentioned it but got the typical Calgary response, \"Sorry\"  

We had to get up to ask for a second and third round of water and drinks from the bar.  Our server was BRUTAL!!!  Too busy texting."}
{"text":"The Joyce on 4th has great chairs. But perhaps you don't want to judge a restaurant purely on their seating?
The food is also really quite good as well. They take ordinary Irish fare and simply make it better and then throw a few less conventional items (like some great signature salads) onto the menu as well. The chicken pot pie might be the best in the city and they know how to pour a Guinness. During the summer the Joyce has a highly underrated patio that is great for people watching. 
Regrettably the service is often a bit on the slow side and if you aren't drinking alcohol there is a chance they will forget to bring you your water or pop. And they are defiantly not the cheapest pub to grab a bite in. Overall I really like the Joyce -just not all the time.

Seriously, great chairs though."}
{"text":"Yikes! This place used to be owned by a nice Irish couple who kept it traditional with beautiful furnishings and delicious authentic Irish food.
 It was sold to a pub group who installed television screens everywhere,and turned it into a sports pub.
 But worse than that,they have let the furniture become worn out.Torn fabric on chairs,wobbly wooden chairs and stools.Even worse,the food is discusting now.I just returned from eating their fish and chips which were overcooked bits of something that I could hardly taste as the crust was hard and greasy.I won't go back.Its really too bad as I do live closeby."}
{"text":"The service is good if you're sitting at the bar and the bartenders are friendly & efficient but not if you're at a table. I've eaten here a few times it brought people in and sat at a table but not any more. Service is always bad even when they're not busy. I don't get it"}
{"text":"Ridiculous. Went recently as I was excited for them to reopen following the June flood. My friend and I were looking forward to conversation over a couple of cold ones but the server wanted me to provide a second piece of photo ID. I don't walk around with my passport on me 24/7 as I have never been asked anywhere else, even in a nightclub. She stared blankly at me and stated that the picture on my current, Alberta government issued ID does NOT look like me! Excuse me?? All she needs to do is verify the patron is of age. Not only was that me then when the picture was taken, this is me NOW as I follow the rest of my party out the door.

Many people will continue to frequent this pub... I, however, will not be one of them."}
{"text":"Recently we have gone for brunch.  There classic breakfast so tasy and a great price.  Also they have a great selection of whiskey and beers.  Fun place to go with friends."}
{"text":"Our server was great. She was friendly, informative and attentive. Our booth was cozy and the ambience was pleasant. The food was fine but not outstanding. They have a nice selection of beers. They have two non-alcoholic beer choices and both tasted good."}
{"text":"Stopped in at this neighborhood pub last Thursday night with a group of friends to attend the one year post flood party! It was absolutely packed but we managed to get a table. I found that the beer selection was fantastic! They have 72 beers on tap, and the server completely navigated us through the beer menu and the difference between each beer. She was very knowledgeable, and over the course of a few hours we tried many different beers. To eat, we ordered the Celtic Clubhouse, and the steak sandwich. Both were delicious, and flavorful. (I've posted pictures of our meals). In true fashion of the pub, they had an Irish band playing live music. It made the night more enjoyable and people were even getting up to dance. Overall, if you're looking for a good pub with live music,and good beer you should try out Joyce on 4th!"}
{"text":"Phoned on Wednesday to book a reservation for last night (Saturday) and the gentleman who took my information for the reservation didn't sound 100% thrilled to be on the phone or taking the reservation. Fast forward to 6:50pm last night, three of the 7 of us I had reserved for show up only to be told there wasn't a reservation, and the staff seemingly didn't care that I wad upset over the lost reservation.  Now I'm not sure what the issue was, whether the guy who took the call just didn't write the info down,  or if the info got misplaced, but it was highly unprofessional and not appreciated.  The hostess seated us at a decent table, with a view of the hockey game on the big screens, but it took a while for our server to acknowledge our being there,  she chose rather to focus on the table of 4 filled with younger guys instead.  Once we got our drink orders taken she really shined.  Food order was taken in quick time once the rest of the group showed up, and my only issue with my food was that my medium well steak was terrible and she only checked with one side of the table to see how their meals were. She wound up getting more tables and focused on the younger crowd that came in, rather than checking in with our group. Oh well. I guess it'll be a while till we go back there."}
{"text":"Dropped in to check out the renovated space since the flood. The layout is much better. We sat at the bar where the service was ok. I was overwhelmed by all the beer choices so I asked the bartender to choose me one that was 'not too hoppy'. He brings me a Coors. I might look like the most boring, unadventurous, old person out there! Sorry zero points for creativity!

I grabbed a plate of jumbo buffalo wings($13.50). Yuck. All breading, like cracker crumbs soaked in hot sauce.

The 2 egg breakfast looked really good for $6.50, (until 2pm) which included bacon and sausage! That's good to know for future."}
{"text":"Oh Joyce, how I normally love you for Sunday brunch, but you just disappointed me so much in our last visit. 

Went on Lilac Festival Sunday and first disappointment was that they weren't doing brunch. Ok I get it, Lilac is crazy for the restaurants on 4th. You want to keep life as easy as possible for your kitchen. I can get over this as I quite like the rest of the food you do too. Plus you had a full menu for the day which was a nice surprise all things considered.

We had the same waitress as we have had before, she does a good job just always seems a bit flustered. But never gets any orders wrong so very middle ground there.

Now lets talk about the food we got, bearing in mind we arrived at 10am and there was hardly anyone there yet. Food also took nearly 40 minutes to come out the kitchen. Once again there wasn't that many people there yet and all the servers were helping running food so don't think that the food was sitting on the pass for ages waiting to be picked up from the kitchen.

One person got the pulled pork sliders. All the slider meat was cold. Not even cool but cold. Taste was alright but not great as cold pulled pork isn't the best.

2 of us had the chicken and brie sandwich. What was going on with that chicken? It was really tough and almost had a harder casing around it. Did you guys boil it to per cook and then microwave it before putting it on the sandwich? Really really disappointing and zero flavour. Our fries were also cold.

Lamb burger was dry. The boy has had it before and enjoyed it, but not sure where they went wrong this time.

The one breakfast item they did have was a breakfast sandwich. Reports back on it were \"Its just alright\" and potatoes were cool.

The only plus of the whole meal? The sun was shining and the beer was cold. You guys are really only getting more than one star based on the fact you have done better in the past and I really have enjoyed your food previously. Will give the benefit of the doubt and assume 1/2 the kitchen had called in sick."}
{"text":"#142

I've been going to the Joyce On 4th Pub & Restaurant on and off for the last 3 or so years. I've put off reviewing it, partly because I'm lazy and partly because, for me to write a review I consider fun and/or informative, I have to be moved one way or the other.

Located on 4th St SW and 24th Ave SW across from Earl's and diagonally across from Shoppers Drug Mart, Joyce was closed for a few months to recover from the 2013 floods. A nice remodel can be a lot like a facelift or other cosmetic surgery, it looks great but only covers the underlying problem.

The underlying problem is the inconsistency of the food quality and service.

Let's start with the food quality. It does not seem to matter if you have one of the nightly specials such as Monday's 32 cent wings (min. order of 10) (which are 25 cents as of 6 July 2015) or Tuesday's 3 tacos for $7.50 (normally 3 for $13+ but this summer, for 1 hour after sundown, they are 3 for $4.50 so based on the normal price, you are getting 6 free tacos if you bought $13 worth which I have done ;) ) or the weekend breakfast or even one of their entrées. I know from reading the menus that Joyce states that it gets most ingredients locally (as I stated in an updated review for #141 (posted on Facebook due to a greater than average length as well as other reasons)), I am not sure if local means Calgary, the province, or in Canada (or even local in North America). Additionally, if you have or are prone to diabetes, liver, and/or kidney problems (because of family history), bring your own condiments as most of theirs have Canada's version of High Fructose Corn Syrup, glucose-fructose. 

Next, the service can also be hit or miss. I've noticed since I go there a lot, many of the servers recognize or know me so I get excellent service (which I totally appreciate) but every now and then, I get someone whom doesn't know me and it goes down the toilet (in the basement). This is not an attack but an observation. That being said, it takes away from the experience (there are so many other pubs offering similar items).

Please note, this problem, however, is not unique to Joyce but I've found it a common theme in other businesses in Alberta and British Columbia as well (I have not been east yet so I do not have first hand experience).

What does have consistent quality is the selections of international, national, regional, and local beers. You do have to be careful as they can run out of some of regional beers like Gas Lamp's Belgian White Mist (a favourite among many guest including yours truly because one beer a week is okay).

They do have free wi-fi (their own running on Shaw as well as Shaw itself for Shaw customers) so you can attempt to work or look busy while having some suds.

One last point, parking in the area can be a little tough (there is a parking garage with small spots as well as street parking on both 4th Ave SW and the cross streets but with so many restaurants in that area and 2 Shoppers Drug Marts (one is the old Paragon Pharmacy)), it can be a challenge. You can take Calgary Transit's 3, 17, and 419 bus or a taxi (car2go would require parking).

Overall, Joyce is on the Edge of Glory, it will just take an aggressive push to do so while at the same time, not slandering its past or being hostile to it's present. I keep coming back because I do get good service (with the caveat mentioned above) and I do believe they are heading in the right direction (I want to encourage this in a business no matter the size). So, as Patsy says, \"Right. Cheers. Thanks-a-lot\"."}
{"text":"Massive selection of beer on tap. Huge disappointment in the food department. 

Came in on a Wednesday. Burger and wing specials. The best part of the burger was the bacon. How do you complain about bacon? You don't. Ever. So the bacon was good. The rest of the burger was a grilled from frozen,  flavourless patty on a mediocre bun. Despite the deliciousness of the bacon,  this burger couldn't be saved. Side of fries,  just average. But for $6.50, what should I have expected? This is a $15 burger town!  Maybe it's turned me into a burger snob. 

The wings were ok. Big. Saucy. But luke cold. :(

Service. Good. 

Post flood decoration. Awesome. Hammered tin ceiling. Nice floors. Big booths. Lots of TV's. Cool lighting. 

I'd come back for beers,  maybe try some non special of the day food and hope for the best. All in all just ok."}
{"text":"I enjoy the Joyce.  The food is good and the beer selection is acceptable.  It's worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite pub that serves my favorite Stella Artois. I love the mission area and Its patio spot. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was very happy to see James Joyce on 4th Street open again post-floods. They still offer a range of beers from around the world on tap and bottled, yummy pub fare and UK pub atmosphere. On this visit, we just stopped in for a pint on a walking pub crawl, but definitely a place I will continue to come back to for beers, live music and the patio."}
{"text":"Watched the UFC here on the weekend. Ten bucks to get in, ok, but where the hell was your extra security? 

The main event featured a full on brawl at the bar. The poor doorman had no clue what to do. The bartender goes ninja flying over the bar to step in. A knock-out outside and a TKO on the TV inside. 

You guys know how to put on a good fight in Calgary. Maybe splurge on a little extra security for the next UFC night. 
Just a thought."}
{"text":"The Joyce on 4th has become one of my go to places since I started working in the area. I can always get in at lunch without a reservation - nearly impossible at the James Joyce on 8th.  If they have the steak sandwich special order it!  It is very high quality and a real bargain.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Understaffed today on probably the largest hangover day off the year. 
The food is cheap but tasty.    
Ceasers were on special and that made me happy. 
Had the eggs Florentine.  Delicious hash browns.
They have nice cozy booths that create an intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"The drink deals were great, the patio was nice, the food was ok, but the service was pretty terrible. Came here with some girlfriends and their wine bottles were 51% off which was a wicked deal! We also got a lovely shaded spot on the patio. I ordered the Shrimp & Avocado wrap with a side of tater tots (they had an impressive list of side dishes to chose from). I was a bit dissapointed in the wrap because the avocado was hard and the \"garlic fried shrimp\" didn't taste very garlicy - but hey its pub food! Unfortunately our server was not very friendly and after our meal we felt neglected. It was 30 degrees out and we sat there with empty wine bottles and empty water glasses for at least 30 mins before she checked on us again!"}
{"text":"Really good food but consistently has painfully slow service. The most recent time we went it took 15 minutes for a server to acknowledge us, and another 15 to get drinks. Server did not know the menu very well. Wrong food was brought to our table."}
{"text":"This place is exactyl what I'd expect it to be. Service is reasonable, menu is decent, breakfast is cheep and delicious (when you're hung over it's amazing), and the ambiance is exactly as you'd expect from an Irish Pub.

We were here for St. Patty's day breakfast and it was great. Server was very friendly, all dressed in green, served us delicious green beer. No complaints at all."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot to have a pint and watch the fight but the management is terrible and does not care about the customer experience. I am a regular and when I tried to get in on St- Patties before the big line up I noticed a VIP entrance. I asked the manager what one does to be a VIP, totally willing to pay an entrance fee and his reaction was to scowl at me and said only regulars... I did a one eighty and will never return. There are lots of other places to watch a fight or a game on TV with my friends!!"}
{"text":"Grabbed some patio time at the Joyce today with some girlfriends.  The patio is south facing so its nice and sunny but also has big umbrellas for those looking for a touch of shade.  There is also a narrow patio on the east side which is much very shady for those of the fairer persuasion.  They have Strong Bow on tap which is always a plus for me and being a traditional pub its nice to see that they have the appropriate glassware for each of their on tap pours.  This may be a picky thing for me but I like it.  They all pull a decent pint of Guiness which for those who don't know is actually less calories than a light beer and full of iron.  It's practically a meal in a glass!  Drink prices are a wee bit dear but they do have daily specials which are worthwhile.  The food menu is typical Irish Pub fare and decently priced, portions are also fairly generous.  The Joyce reguarly has live music which is often traditional and very entertaining.  Service was prompt and very friendly.  This location is newly refurbished following the floods of June 2013 and its really nice to see it back in action."}
{"text":"Just poor service.....period! The worst servers in any pub establishment. They need major improvement. You want really good service and servers that actually are attentive, pleasant and don't leave you 30 minutes with an empty glass....go to Hudson's on 12th Ave and 5th street SW. Now, that's service!"}
{"text":"Good selection of local beers on tap. Wings were frozen variety though, very poor indeed."}
{"text":"I was at this pub for the first time with a group for a friend's birthday. We weren't an extremely big group - maybe 8 people, give or take depending on who was coming or going.

Overall, the experience was nice. We were there during a Flames game and they had ample TVs so that everyone could keep up. The food was the usual pub fare (I've been to the sister restaurants so I was familiar with the menu - the mulligatawny soup is awesome).

However, the service was pretty slow and it took a while for food to come out. After asking for a drink, it could be 30+ minutes before it arrived, even though it wasn't THAT busy. 

All in all, while it was a good place to hang out and I 'd go back, I also wouldn't go out of my way. I'm more of a fan of Donegal or Limericks."}
{"text":"I like the Joyce as they do everything they can to stay true to the authentic Irish concept. Some of the decorations and chairs are straight from Ireland, the pub grub is all a spin on more traditional Irish fare, they've got a few Irish beers on tap and it's not unusual to spy a celtic band playing for the crowd. They do what they do well, but as Calgary's foremost Irish pub, the Joyce also charges a bit of a premium.

I love their appetizers here - the potato nachos are hilarious and delicious, and the Strawberry Brie dish is to die for. The beers on tap are very good, as is most of the food. It is a great place to stop by for lunch, or to grab a pint with friends. 

The atmosphere is pretty joyfully Irish, and I like that."}
{"text":"When Red's Diner was obviously donning a long line we had to look for another breakfast place and just a block away from my home there was a huge sign quoting a $4.99 breakfast.  Joyce on fourth is just kitty corner to Earls on 4th street and because it is a pub and I don't drink beer I have never entered the location.

Today the pub was half full on a Sunday and I was quite surprised how spacious it was.  We ordered a couple of eggs bennies and coffee and the bill came to around $14 which is unheard of for breakfast.

The poached eggs were done perfectly and the sauce had a great consistency and although I felt it lacked a lemon tanginess it was pretty tasty.  Hash browns accompanied the eggs, so with a bottomless cup of coffee it made perfect sense at under $7 a person.

The pub itself has the usual Irish Pub interior with gold railings, wooden furniture, moulded ceilings and pub decorations. 

We sat at a wooden table near a window and we were able to enjoy the view outside and the good feelings of a lazy sunny afternoon."}
{"text":"My sister and I were enjoying a lovely day in the sun when we decided to grab a bite to eat nearby. We noticed the specials here and thought we'd give it a shot seeing as the patio was nearly empty and the prices looked right. We immediately took a spot in the beautiful sun, and I was dying for a drink. We waited about 10 minutes with no server in sight so I actually had to walk inside the restaurant and ask the bartender if there was a server outside. She eventually made her way out and greeted us without a smile or friendly tone at all. We ordered and passed the time while talking and people watching, but our food took over 40 minutes to come out. Seeing as how the place wasn't very busy, I didn't understand why our server was so slow/never around/took forever for everything. Once I got my burger, it was really delicious and I enjoyed it a lot! I just don't enjoy waiting ages for someone when all I want is a water, or a napkin, or my bill. Eeeek - I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"So I am not sure if I have ever been let down as much as I was tonight. This \"Irish\" bar is nothing more then a shitty excuse for a pub. Ordered food numerous times and it is always a let down. Tonight was an amazing reality that they are incapable of even cooking food. It is astonishing they are actually in business. To set the table for the experience.. which I use those words lightly (since we ordered take out). I will set the stage... super excited ordered pulled pork poutine which looked like someone shit on it. Stuffed yorkies.. which were burnt as fuck. Chicken wings were slightly fine. But lets face it thats not to hard. Garlic cheese toast that looked like it was in the toaster 3x. All in all the staff were very great. Would I go there ever again. NO. Its a typical blind leading the blind. You want Irish? Better luck at Dennys...."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere and great chicken wings! If you aren't a sports fan though, all the screens in every corner of the place can be distracting. Diverse selection of beers and ciders I have found gives both male and female patrons options in terms of a drink."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the low ratings.....
The food was absolutely delicious, the ambience was adequate, the service was personable and the washroom stall for those who require more room for a wheel chair was designed well.  
As a foodie, aka \"Food Snob\"  I don't waste my time at sub-par establishments.  Of course how does one know the resto will pull through even if the yelpers before me have not enjoyed such positive experiences?  Well, non-yelpers who have eaten well at Joyce on 4th suggested this place.  I am so happy Joyce delivered.  I will definitely eat here again and my mom is looking forward to eating here and taking in a live band and \"partying\".  She is 70 and in a wheel chair.  I have never heard her say she wanted to party downtown until the day we had lupper here.  

Kudos to the chef."}
{"text":"Thursday night after a WOD, a couple girls and I decided to head down to Mission for a bite to eat.  We wandered around in some places but they were full as there was a hockey game on.  We chanced it at Joyce and got lucky with a high top table for three.  Joyce is an Irish pub located on the strip of 4th street in Mission, across the street from Earls.

Music was loud but not blazing loud, we were able to hear each other talk.  There were crowds of people but it wasn't bumpy busy, we just minded our own busy at the high top.  Shortly, the waitress came around to hand us menus and water.   Mecoh and I are doing paleo while Maddie isn't so Mecoh and I ordered the original 1937 cobb salad with the dressing on the side and no bleu cheese.   Maddie went with the chicken and brie sandwich and the soup of the day.  

The food came out altogether and the salad was huge.  The cobb salad was a mix of iceberg and romaine lettuce topped with rows of avocado, tomato, bacon, green onions, hardboiled egg, and chicken.  If you're trying to watch what you eat....this would be the salad to get.  Simple yet delicious!!  Maddie's chicken brie sandwich was some charbroiled chicken topped with brie and a tomato relish on a multi grain bun with dijon mayo and soup of the day which was a spicy curry soup thick.  The sandwich didn't look appetizing to me but Maddie thought it was okay.  I notice the brie wasn't melted but more like a thick slice.  Maddie thought the soup was too spicy but she doesn't take spicy hot very well.  I mentioned that it would be lovely on a bed of rice, so she took the soup to go ;)

Overall, the food wasn't anything special but it was good.  Typical pub food but with slightly more options.  I was drooling over the other items in the menu, nachos, sticky toffee pudding!!!!! (can't believe I didn't order my favorite dessert - yay for self control ;)).

I can't wait to come back to try all the pub grub I'm not allowed to have right now. Hehe  I'd say Joyce is a great place to chill with a group of friends and take your time, have a couple drinks and shoot the shit.

See you later next month Joyce! :)"}
{"text":"Just Kilkenny to go until we complete our tour of Calgary's Best Pubs. Compared to the others in their company (Dixon's, Limerick's, etc.) I would rate this in the top tier - it is a good location (albeit out of the way), their patio is street level so you don't feel superior to the mortals walking past, and the food was actually pretty great. I had the Big Pub Burger on a whim (I was looking at the pizzas on special), and it was one of the better I've tried, miles above the burnt turd that was Donegal's buffalo burger. The toppings (including sauteed mushrooms and onions!) were plentiful without sliding apart in a giant heap, the bun was on the right side of dry, and the patty itself was juicy and well-seasoned. The only letdown was the suds on tap: where Limerick's has a massive list of beers, in tiny cramped font to fit them all on one page, Joyce has about five imports - it was a Guinness bought with some remorse. Perhaps the food was a fluke; I will need to revisit to make sure."}
{"text":"I walked into the Joyce On 4th on a Friday night in the middle of July... Patio flanked in flowers, live band wailing away the best of Maritime band cover tunes, beer a flowing and fun being had by all. Now this is a great neighbourhood pub! 

The look of the place with dark leather and brass is right in step with the music and crowd. The wait staff was totally on cue and we never had to wait for a drink. While I didn't eat much, I did have a mini yorkie (a Canadian pub grub fave) and it was excellent! I have to say, I have never seen them served in muffin tins before, super cute idea! I am so stealing that come Christmas. 

While this may not be my first choice of places to go in Mission, it's definitely now on my short list."}
{"text":"Cool irish bar in a good location.. The service is ok. And the food too. Not terrible, but not incredible. I would go back there with a group of friends to have a good time, but I wouldn't recommend this place to eat."}
{"text":"Fun place to watch the game and some good cheap beer (the house stuff).   But really each food item is truly bad. (I've tried 8 items, including the wings which are quite dry).    I've heard the yorkshire things are decent though.  Nice, friendly place - just really needs a new chef."}
{"text":"After discovering that they have a brunch menu here, we thought we would give it a shot this Sunday as we read the brunch menu seeing that the prices were really cheap. Perfect! After coming into a nearly empty place, we walked past 3 servers while choosing a seat. None of them greeted us or offered us a menu. We chose a seat and then had to ask the bartender for a menu finally. We ordered the breakfast wrap and big pub breakfast. The only reason I give this 2 stars is because the breakfast itself was inexpensive and decent for basic breakfast fare. The food came out quickly. HOWEVER....I was shocked to see that at the time of our bill they charged us $8 for 2 red rose teas which we got lukewarm water with and never got offered a top up of water. I rarely spend over $3 - 3.50 for fancy loose leaf tea at even the higher end breakfast places, so I never would have expected to pay $4 each for a .05cent subpar teabag. This in itself which brought our \"cheap\" breakfast to a rediculous price for what we got plus the no service factor in an empty restaurant left a very poor impression on me. Try the breakfast, but take your patience and dont bother wasting extra money on crummy tea."}
{"text":"Great place with amazing wings. Waitresses and bartenders are great but sometimes feel ignored by some of them. Had to ask for a menu and nobody came back around to ask me if I wanted anything for 20 minutes. Besides that its an awesome place for a drink, good wings and to watch sports."}
