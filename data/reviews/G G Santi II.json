{"text":"Came across this cute kiosk at the Grand Canal in The Venetian hotel. 

Saw that they were selling pretty chocolates, candied apples and other baked goods. I ended up getting their mini-vanilla macaroons - good, not great and were a little pricey for the quality. 

Not a bad spot if you need a quick sweets fix while at the Venetian."}
{"text":"... I've been to the Venetian A LOT... I've walked by this shop A LOT.  Everything looks so good... but never bought anything until one particular day when I figured.. hey why not, let's get a candy apple.

Got an apple with my friend.  The apple was mushy and tasted old... you know when an apple gets crumbly... not juicy... yeah it was like that.

I would probably try a cupcake or something, but no thanks on the apples."}
{"text":"Thank you for the mini peanut butter cupcake, babe.  We ventured out to The Venetian so that I can see the hotels and because my beloved Bouchon Bakery is located here.  After I bought a pack of mini macaroons from Bouchon and put the entire chocolate macaroon in my mouth, to my right there stands yet another bakery and of course, we had to make a stop.  Since I just ate 300 calories about a few seconds ago, I opted for the mini peanut butter cupcake.  He got a rum ball for himself and a tiramisu cupcake for his brother (forgot if it's the regular sized one or the mini one); the 3 of us were pretty satisfied w/ our selections.  The cake part is soft and moist and the frosting isn't too sweet although I wish it was richer.

Truffles and cupcakes galore.. this place has it all!"}
{"text":"We had stopped by Bouchon Bakery, and right around the corner is this little hidden gem. Located right off the elevator next to Grand Lux Cafe. Just like the previous review, I had just purchased a couple hundred calories, but as we walked by we noticed these beautiful candied apples. Almost too pretty to eat. Along with apples, they had cupcakes, chocolate dipped pretzels, toffee, and many more treats. I went with a milk chocolate/carmel covered pretzel and a pistachio chocolate square. Both were good."}
