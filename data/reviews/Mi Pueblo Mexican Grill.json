{"text":"Awesome. The wak-a-mole was the best ever.
Shrimp tacos too, very unusual and tasty.
Flan was great.
No more On The Border for us."}
{"text":"I have been going here pretty much since I moved to CLT. I've never had a bad experience. The service is always very fast, seated right away, chips and salsa and servers ready for you whenever you are. Food comes out very quickly and is always delicious. It's a favorite dinner spot with friends. We love to share the pitcher of margaritas on the rocks and the cheese dip. Both are delicious, love the margaritas!! I've tried a bunch of the dinner items and have not been disappointed, every one has been tasty. And I have leftovers for lunch! Also LOVE the free soft serve!

One of my favorite spots. Great menu, great service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Our dinner was not enjoyable at all.   It was Cinco  De Mayo, great occasion for a Mexican outing.  But the music was so loud that all conversation was drowned out.  Our waiter did his best under difficult circumstances.   My Tex-Mex was fine, but my wife's pork \"tenderloin\" was overcooked and tough.  Then the manager argued that it wasn't tough.  A miserable experience - we won't be back."}
{"text":"The new menu is really awesome. It offers many new combinations that are really good. The Guaca Chicken, one of my favorites, is now on this menu and not just on the specials menu. Great move."}
{"text":"Is the food good?  Yes, most of the dishes are pretty good (I have to disagree with those who like the veggie tamales).  Here's why I'm giving this restaurant one star:  On  a Monday night with a party of 3, we asked to sit on the patio.  There was only one other party out there - the place was almost empty (the patio is quite large).  We asked to sit at a round table, but were told no, that was reserved for larger parties.  Now I totally get that policy, but on a Monday night when it was almost empty?  

So dinner was fine, however...I was shocked to look at the bill.  We were charged .95 cents for the small dish of pico de gaillo we asked for in addition to the salsa.  I ate half my dish and so asked for a to-go box -- they charged a takeout fee of .25 cents.  I also asked for a small refresher of the cheese dip so I could enjoy my takeout -- they put 2 tablespoons into a container and that was an extra charge of $1.95.   

I know containers cost money, etc., but most restaurants build it into the price of the meal.  We thought it was a lousy business model to charge \"extra,\" so although we enjoyed the food, we were not happy with the restaurant` taking every opportunity to nickel and dime the customer."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, had to ask for more salsa even though empty bottles were clearly seen on the table and she left all 3 empty bottles on the table the whole dinner. Also had to ask for silverware and napkins. Also had to ask for tortillas that were supposed to come with the entrees. 

Food was satisfactory, nothing special. It is the run of the mill American style Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great food, chicken fajita quesadilla's are amazing. management refused to except valid coupon and yelp! \"check-in\" coupon."}
{"text":"First off there place was very nice from the outside and looked upscale. The booth seemed a little tight but it was manageable. Def the first time I ordered in English in a Mexican restaurant so that was an experience. Both my gf and I got fajitas and it was pretty good and reasonably priced. I ordered the horchata and it was very good. I have had more authentic experiences but I'd recommend this place for someone trying something different."}
{"text":"Great spot!  Outdoor patio with waterfalls and fountains is a nice place to relax and unwind.  Staff is friendly and service was awesome.  Timely, accurate, attentive.  We had margaritas.  Nice size serving and very nice presentation....paper umbrella included!   Fajita Nachos are really delicious and fed two hungry adults.  Definitely earmarked to come back.  Especially want to try brunch and I envision coming back with other  couples!"}
{"text":"I returned once again, but I must say I was a bit disappointed.  I went on Thursday night and had very slow service(I sat at the patio).  I asked my waiter for drinks.   He never came with them.  I also asked some of the other waiters for it and they said sure thats fine I will be back.  They never came with my drinks.  I finally got my drinks when I spotted the hostess(young girl with glasses) in the patio and told her if she could have gotten us something to drink.  She took our drink order without hesitation.  In less than a minute she was back.  She offered to refill our chip bowl and gave us more salsa.  The hostess provided better service in a couple of minutes than I have ever recieved from any server here.  Honestly if we recieved service the way she provided it in 5 minutes it would be a 5 Star restaurant.  I will return and hope I have better service to increase in rating."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten at Mi Pueblo a number of times, it is located a couple of miles from our home. We have never had a bad meal and the service has always been great. The prices are very reasonable....all of this is why we have been here a number of times. 

I had the jerk chicken for the first time. I will have it again for sure. The chicken was in stips, char-grilled, and very juicy. The jerk sauce was a sour cream / pineapple blend which was very good. Not spicy at all which I would have liked but the mixture of sweet and sour really worked well. Also on the plate was a side of black beans and white rice along with grilled asparagus and zucchini. 

We will definitely continue to eat here. They have a very robust menu, lots of liquor and drink specials, tons of seating indoors and outdoors, and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food was great but our service not so much. He took my brothers drink as if he was going to refill it but he never came back with it. We had to remind him. He never brought my guacamole either. So I told him I didn't want it anymore. They need to work on their customer service!"}
{"text":"went to the concord restaurant for the first time last nite. REALLY excellent Mexican food, I loved that you could order a side of something for a few dollars--everything was really delicious, one of the best mexican restaaurants ive been to. I highly recommend the poblano peppers:)"}
{"text":"I should have known from the sourpussed faced hostess that sorta greeted us, that I'd be underwhelmed.  

The place is cavernous.  No wonder at 6 on a Sat it didn' t feel busy/energetic.  Requisite chips and salsa on the table were just that.  Server was polite but not particularly knowledgeable.  He had to look back several times to the daily special board to confirm my order.  He had to return to the table to ask what sides I wanted with it.  Pollo adobado al carbon SOUNDS tasty, evokes the thought of bold flavors.  No.  It was not. There was nothing grilled or charcoaled like about it.  It had been reheated.  Warm on the outside tepid inside. I had black beans and mac and cheese with it.  Beans were the best thing at the table.  The mac and cheese was disastrous not because of the color, if you make something green it should have taste, but because it like most everything else was void of salt.  We added salt and salsa to the guacamole and it dramactically improved.  
Portions were generous and pricing was fair.  Service was unimpressive.  I can only imagine how bad it was for the tables of the server that stood across from us watching soccer for 15 minutes.  People don't go out for Mexican food to be bored.  I doubt a return is in the cards.  I'll take my chances on local food trucks for more authentic bold tastes."}
{"text":"This place was beautiful and amazing. Huge portions, delicious food, cheap prices - our new favorite mexican place! The service was wonderful and friendly and even the menu explains some dishes  on the back if you're unfamiliar with the type of food. We sat outside on the porch and it was simply beautiful atmosphere and unbelievable value. Will go again, a lot. I'm very happy I tried this place."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  The food is fresh, abundant and oh so flavorful!!  I love the design and cleanliness of the interior and the waitstaff is friendly and attentive.  It's got it all going on!!!  You're missing out if you don't go here."}
{"text":"Great Place for family, couples or to hang out with the girls...  my favorite is the Jerk chicken... wow go figure a mexican spot with good jerk chicken.. now its their own take of the infamous jerk chicken but never the less it is good... Drinks are reasonable and good...a very CLEAN place."}
{"text":"I had lunch here the other day.   I had chicken fajitas.  Most of the meals are made with refried beans I was able to get black beans instead.  It was a good meal for a decent price.  The waiter was good."}
{"text":"I tried this place bc it was close and reviews were decent for Mexican food in the area. Our service was good from our waiter Carlos and the food was very tasty. Where they lose my stars was when the food came out. I ordered the fajita special with steak, chicken and shrimp. When it came out they gave me a plate with beans, lots of lettuce with a little guacamole and sour cream and rice. I got two tortillas that were hard and didn't want to peel apart. No cheese and half a slice of tomato. Did they expect me to dice that little piece of tomato myself? With a full skillet of meat only two tortillas? I asked for cheese, they charged me. I had barely enough sour cream for a single fajita so I asked for more, they charged me. I asked for two more tortillas and again, they charged me. It's bad restaurant management when you nickel and dime customers for the standard stuff that comes with fajitas anywhere else. The reviews here were mixed and while the food was good I wouldn't come back here again."}
{"text":"Chips were very stale. Waitress mentioned something about some sort of tortilla chip emergency, so they are having to serve chips from the previous week. Rice was a gummy mess indicating it had been reheated several times. The quac chicken breast was surprisingly  fresh considering the state of the rest of the meal. Dos Equis XX Amber was very fresh and cold. The initial salsa tasted fresh. Almost too fresh and familiar. It hit me that they may be serving Pace Picante sauce. The hot sauce that you have to ask for was actually the best part of the meal. I won't be going back. Wife enjoyed the mojito. She stated the chicken in her enchilada was fresh but ruined by the large amount of lettuce tomato and sour cream salad sitting on top cooling everything down. visited on July 4th so maybe that has something to do with the abysmal quality of the food"}
{"text":"Love the Chiles poblanos here, so no problem with the food.  Love them so much that today I placed an order for pickup. Also gave my name and phone number when I placed the order.  Service person indicated my order would be ready in 15 minutes, which is fine since that is how long my travel time to the restaurant would be.  Arrived at the restaurant only to be told that they are out of chiles poblanos.   Inquired as to why they didn't use the number provided when I ordered to let me know, savimg me a trip and merely received a shrug. Despite the great chiles poblanos, I won't be back"}
{"text":"Love the Papa Mixta and the tequilla Sunrises!!!!"}
{"text":"Would highly recommend this place to someone. Our server Eric was very polite and quick. He made sure we had everything we needed. The food did not take long at all to be ready. I had the beef tips which were amazing just be ready for a runny nose because they are very spicy. We sat outside and it was very fancy looking. The food was not expensive and was very good and filling."}
{"text":"I'm always torn about this place. It's nice inside, the food is good but most of the waiters and waitresses are horrible. They are not always friendly, they are not attentive, and at times rude. A waiter came to clear my husband plate and even though I was still eating he reached over my plate to grab my unused knife, who does that? Numerous times our waiters/waitresses are no where to be found. Good luck getting a refill, more chips, or your check."}
{"text":"Service was extremely bad. Food was average American-mex, nothing to write home about. 
The best thing about it, the beer was cheap. I would go back."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Very nice and clean. Price is good. Had American sports on the TVs not Univision on every TV. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food was fast and good
Waitress was kind of pushy kept coming trying to take my plate."}
{"text":"The service is not the best because you can forget about a refill unless management walks by. The food is cheap but you get what you pay for. It doesn't taste authentic and if you order something you don't know you may be missing ingredients. My husband loves chili relano and there was no chili plus a sliced piece of cheese melted on top. The waiter even tried to make excuses for the cook. The ground beef is standard on everything that has ground beef in it also the salsa is pre-made and you cannot order salsa without cilantro if your allergic."}
{"text":"Drove to this area iso of new restaurant that happened to be closed on SUNDAY.  Should've called to confirm but was advised it would be open.  THIS IS HOW WE FOUND OURSELVES AT MI PUEBLO - SARDIS RD.

We were greeted & immediately seated at a booth.  There were several other tables occupied ( LOTS OF PATIO DINERS ) but mostly empty inside.  Suited me just fine with Latin music playing lightly in the background. Nachos & salsa were served gratis.  Neither of us enjoy hot salsa so we passed after the 1st taste ( Nachos were fresh ! )  Appetizer was CHICKEN NACHOS ... delicious!  My sweet tea was puurfectly sweet but not TOO SWEET.  We ordered 2 Arroz Con Pollo entrees.  We both agreed this dish could've been GREAT but it was a bit too salty.  The cook seasoned the food + chose a salty cheese for the cheese sauce.  

Our bill was $41 ... not bad at all.  We will try MI PUEBLO again & will remember to ask for MILD SALSA and will opt for an entrée w/o the cheese sauce.  ***3 1/2 STARS"}
{"text":"The food is okay. There isnt much choices in Concord. 
 I've had better. The wait staff are always horrible. With their racist jokes and constant rushing. Go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Servers are usually nice 2/3 times I've been here. The food is delicious and its always nice to go right when they open and have the restaurant yourself. Their homemade corn tortillas are amazing along with the cheese enchiladas ahhh"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant. Love the Arroz Con Pollo and the Guaca Chicken!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our service by waiter Eric.  He took down 3 wrong orders and told us \"that's not what you told me\" mind you he got the first orders wrong. Poor customer skills and very rude.  He threw the plates on the rack with attitude and offered to pay for one wrong order.  When we asked why was one going to be paid for he said \"because you were not nice about it. At the end 2 people left with their food since they did not have time to eat."}
{"text":"Took the family here last night since we were shopping in the area.  Food was just blah.  Refried beans had no flavor, rice was dry and flavorless, and my taco and enchilada were nothing special.  The salsa was good and the staff was friendly, but the food will not bring me back as there are plenty of other choices around with better Mexican food."}
{"text":"The décor is pretty horrible - s**t-brown walls, floor to ceiling (and high ceilings so a lot of it), none of the usual bright, cheerful, Mexican colors, just ugly throughout.  So, that doesn't make for good dining ambiance.
 
Service was terrible.  There seemed to be a lot of people in Mi Pueblo uniforms wandering about, but not actually doing anything.  Although chips and salsa (not fiery enough for our tastes) were placed on our table almost immediately, we had to wait a good 10 minutes before we managed to flag down a passing employee who went to look for a waiter.  Another 5 minutes passed before our waiter approached.  

We ordered margaritas - a monster one with an extra shot of tequila and a regular one, on the rocks with salt.  We weren't asked if we had a tequila preference.  The margaritas were brought to the table fairly quickly, together with a glass of water which we had requested.  Let's just say I have had better margaritas.   

The food didn't take long to come out of the kitchen.  Steak fajitas and enchiladas de lujo (one each of chicken, beef, cheese and beans).  Only two flour tortillas with the fajita platter (I wasn't asked if I wanted flour or corn tortillas), as well as a plate of refried beans with shredded cheese, Mexican rice and a tortilla basket with some shredded lettuce, a tomato slice, a dollop each of sour cream and avocado (which was like the so-called guacamole you get in tubs in the grocery store, and which was not fresh as it had discolored from being out in the light for too long).  No plate, so had to hold a tortilla in one hand, while filling it with the other.  The steak was really chewy and dry and not very flavorful, onions and peppers were sparse, and I didn't see any tomatoes.  I asked for some corn tortillas, which, together with a good dose of salsa, helped give the fajitas a bit of flavor.   

The enchiladas plate looked a mess.  Actually it looked like a load of shredded lettuce with a couple of dollops of that sour cream stuff plopped onto it.  Underneath all of the lettuce were the enchiladas.  They were okay, nothing special, a bit sloppy.  But really all that lettuce thrown on the top was off-putting - not something you want mixed up with hot food.  I still don't know what the \"fresh enchilada sauce\" was as I couldn't see it and the taste was indeterminate. 

To be honest, we were sceptical about going to Mi Pueblo as our experience with these types of \"theme\" restaurants hasn't been great, but we had a money-off coupon.  As it is, we won't be returning - there are plenty of good, more authentic (what, no macaroni, jerk chicken, pineapple??) Mexican restaurants in Charlotte."}

{"text":"I really like this place. I love their salsa. Makes me want to cry of happiness because it's so mouth-watering and delectable. I'd swim in it with my mouth open and eyes closed. Just toss me some chips every now and again."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was a bit slow considering they weren't that busy and they were fully staffed. They need a better bar selection. The restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were average. Most of the chips were crushed when they were brought out to the table. Ordered the enchiladas supreme. Very average and bland. For a restaurant that has a beautiful interior, my experience was average at best."}
{"text":"I was looking for Mexican food and decided I would give this place a try. At first I was skeptical, as this had the appearance of a \"chain restaurant.\"  I've had terrible experiences with those in the past and the food has always been bland and lackluster. Not so with Mi Pueblo, I was pleasantly surprised at the wide variety of offerings. Everything I tried was very very good, and I was impressed with the options for vegetarian/vegan dishes. I also asked for \"extra-hot\" sauces on the side and they delivered!  Everything I tried was tasty, flavorful, and as hot as I could stand it.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"ok, I like the atmosphere, prices, and the staff is very friendly. chimichengas are good! salsa is that kind with all the big chuncks and celantro. (i like my salsa thin and no celantro).  they have good rice too"}
{"text":"This is a solid choice for lunch.  We've been several times when we needed a break from shopping/running errands.  I got a rather large margarita on one such occasion, and followed it up with a Modelo.  Let's just say I was pleasantly tipsy, and when we were leaving there were people dressed in minion costumes in a field with lots of children.  I rolled down the window and started screaming \"Bob! Kevin!\" All of this to point out a margarita at Mi Pueblo is delicious and they obviously don't skimp on the tequila.  I usually go with the ACP...It's tasty and I enjoy it."}
{"text":"This is easily the best Mexican-American food I've ever had and I've had a lot.  Just go.

I used to live in San Diego where there are tons of Mexican restaurants and food trucks.  Also eaten at a lot of places in the Carolina's.  Mi Pueblo is the best.  It always tastes fresh.  The manager told me they don't use canned food and I believe it.  Try the Chicken Chimichanga to get started.  My wife and I eat for under $20 every time and we usually have left overs."}
{"text":"This is the worst Mexican restaurant that I've been to probably ever. I even went a second time to make sure that I was correct. I was and it is horrible. The food is tasteless."}
{"text":"Mi Pueblo is my go to Mexican food restaurant in Charlotte. The service was great as the friendly staff kept us stocked with food and drinks from moments after we walked into the door. The place is squeaky clean and the food is AMAZING!!! I highly recommend Mi Pueblo if you're in the area and in need of a quick fix for your south of the border cravings!!! No matter what you get it will be fresh, hot, and in portions so large you'll need a big bag to carry the leftovers home with you."}
{"text":"I went there today with my husband...it was our first time going there. The food and service was great. Would recommend this place to all my family and friends."}
{"text":"I've given this restaurant a few more visits and really enjoy it. I haven't had any issues with slow service, and their Dos Equis tacos are five star worthy. Absolutely get the Dos Equis tacos. 

Their margaritas are really good as well. I've had their sangria margarita, which goes together really well."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to Mi Pueblo! Went for lunch last week and had the fajitas. The lunch special came with rice and refried beans.  I was so disappointed. The fajitas had almost no flavor. Very blah.

The chips and salsa were o.k. so I will give 2 stars."}
{"text":"Ten times delicious!
We continue to be impressed.
Stop by and try anything.
I suppose I'll keep typing tho get to the point where the review will post.  And that last sentence was not enough."}
{"text":"This is a good spot for a night out on a budget.  They have a nice patio space, very cheap beer, and big portions.  The food is tasty, but not really special.  I've never had a bad meal, but never had a great one.  

The menu layout is tacky, confusing, and full of weirdly-colored photos.  

Service is good, if a little unprofessional (servers tend to hang out on the patio smoking and talking on the phone.)  

If you want a night out with beer, a full stomach, and a $25 tab, this is a better bet than any of the other restaurants in this shopping center."}
{"text":"Having eaten at this restaurant multiple times, I can say that the Burrito Al Carbon is my favorite. Recently, they changed the plating removing the refried beans and side salad. I'm in favor of the change because the beans and salad were merely fillers. The burrito is great on its own, with a nice mild heat and a tasty flavour. We also got good service from our waiter even during busy hours. Will be back."}
{"text":"The wait staff does not belive in checking on you once your food has arrived unless giving you the bill counts?  Stay away from the nachos unless you like wstered down nachos.  The reason, according to our waiter, its from the chicken sittibg in broth and the lettuce??  My daughter enjoyed her burritto but with how much lettuce (hers was properly drained) she enjoyed a salad too."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken is to die for.  The infusion of pineapple into the sour cream sauce is a delightful pair to the seasoned chicken.  It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Very good flavorful food. We had the Mar y Tierra platter for 4 which is their surf and turf sampler platter with floyr and corn tortillas. Beautiful presentation and very friendly staff. Guacamole was very good also.  Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Waiter was horrible. Had to go back to the kitchen 5 times to get our order correct.
And he still got my order wrong. We gave this place a second try and they failed again.
We are done with this place, and from the conversation from the booth behind us, they
were done also. The chicken was dry, had to ask for more water, and salsa which we never got."}
{"text":"It took them forever to take our drink order, then they got my meal completely wrong and they didn't even apologize. The bathroom was awful and out of paper. I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I have been here many times and the food is good and the patio is wonderful.  They even have a fireplace and can enclose it to use it in the winter.  Genius.  
The food is typical mexican food, which is fine by me because that's my favorite.  I usually go with the fajita quesadilla and always have enough to eat for lunch the next day.  I recommend chicken over steak though- last time I got steak it was so overcooked I could hardly chew it.  But the chicken is always good and cooked well.  There's also a rumor that they have free soft-serve ice cream, but I have yet to test this theory...
The only pitfall is the service sometimes.  We have had some really wonderful, engaging servers that talked with us and seemed to really be enjoying themselves but on 2 separate occasions we had terrible servers.
The first time, the girl had no clue what was on the menu, she asked my dad what a Michelob Light was, and then after a few painful minutes (yes, minutes) of trying to explain, he just said \"forget it, I'll take water\", but when the bill came the beer was still on there.  She looked like she was 16, so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she was brand new.
The second time, we were outside one pretty crowded Friday night.  Our waiter was great- attentive and funny.  But another woman was bringing the food and she was nasty! She had the tray and was trying to figure out who it belonged to.  Speaking at a normal volume, she asked the whole patio \"who ordered a fajita quesadilla?\" I was not expecting to have to be on the lookout for my food so I was talking with my friends and didn't realize it was our tray.  She said again \"You'd think if someone ordered a d*** quesadilla they would speak up!\" At this point I realized she was talking about mine and said \"oh I did\".  She practically threw our food down and stormed off without even so much as a word (although I did get a pretty nasty stink eye).  By now everyone on the patio was looking at us and I was pretty embarrassed.

Overall Mi Pueblo is fantastic and I will definitely keep going back, but some of their waitresses could stand for an attitude adjustment!"}
{"text":"Couldn't have had a better experience. Delila was the best and friendliest server. The restaurant is nice and clean. Even the bathrooms (which is super important when you're potty training a toddler). 

The cheese dip and chips were great. Salsa was a tiny bland but got much better with the addition of the green and spicy salsas. 

DOS EQUIS FISH TACOS were the tastiest fish tacos I've ever had. Great fried haddock pieces with cabbage, pico and a really good chipotle drizzle. Add a squeeze of lime and it's perfect. 

Husband had the Mi Pueblo Special, which has chicken, steak and chorizo with rice and beans. He didn't even have to doctor it up because it was seasoned so well. 

Excellent experience. We will return."}
{"text":"My favorite authentic Mexican restaurant!!! I have not tasted another restaurant that gives me such an authentic taste like Mi Pueblo! The chimichanga is packed with meat and the rice and beans on the side takes it to a whole other level! Listen to me when I say EVERYTHING is good, even down to the chips and salsa! The drinks are always on special and there's always a daily special."}
{"text":"I came back, and really had a great experience all around.  The one thing that I will say is my tamale wasn't as good as normal.  It gets an A-.  Seriously, though, I have never had a bad meal here, and ordered chicken burrito and enchilada, and it was obviously high quality meat.  Food is reasonably priced for the quality.  

Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We came here when the restaurant first opened and weren't impressed; however, we are very happy we decided to give it another try tonight. My California Burrito was huge, loaded with chicken and the black beans I specifically requested in lieu of refried beans. The chicken was well spiced and tender. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his white cheese enchilada and shredded beef taco. I'm sorry I didn't accept his offer to taste it because the taco looked amazing. Our waitress, Delilah, and the manager were very nice and attentive. We will definitely return with friends to enjoy the delicious food and beautiful decor."}
{"text":"Ok. Clean. Affordable. Insanely Delish. This gem of a restaurant always has me coming  back for more. I've been to all of the Mexican restaurants around- and this one is by far the best."}
{"text":"I would say 3.5 stars out of 5- Food was not too bad, not too bad at all. 
My server? I remember was not too good, not too good at all. She was around my age so she was treating me sorta idk, \"weird\" --  I ordered some kind of sampler plate, meh - mediocre. The Pico was yum yum.Not in a rush to \"run back\" to this place. Service needs improvement..."}
{"text":"Excellent. We were in town for a competition and needed a place the whole family would like. Yelp had solid reviews and I was not disappointed. The service was rock solid even when we requested to move from outside to inside (it was cooler than we anticipated). Food was exactly what we needed."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  The guacamole was delicious and I don't even like guacamole!  The service was amazing!  Definitely a return place for wonderful Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times!! The guac is amazing!!! I enjoy the carne asada and tacos!! Margaritas are a must!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and experience. My guest needed gluten free and they went out of way to review meal ingredients to ensure a flour free meal was provided. Very accommodating!"}
{"text":"Great family meal tonight, first time here will not be last. Great menu, had the tres tacos, many choices. Oscar was a great server."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful place. Very clean. The server was very attentive and food was delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone craving some good Mexican. Most definitely."}
{"text":"This is our go-to local mexican restaurant. Love it!! Always good service and excellent food."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch and dinner, The food is good and the portions are huge. My wife and I love the cheese bean dip and the salsa. The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"This place is always good, always good service and always great food. I will definitely continue to bring my family and friends here..."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for the first time last night after waiting for what seemed like forever for it to open over the last several months, however, I can see why it took the time that it did. The inside looks great, lots of details to look at, but that's not why you go to a restaurant, you go for the food.

The food was great! I had the \"Special Dinner\" which tasted and looked great. It came out on two different plates and for around ten dollars was a great deal.

The service was good as well. Miguel served us and was very attentive had a good sense of humor.

Overall, I would definitely go back and make this a regular place to eat when I'm out and about."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a late lunch and was very impressed! It has a nice Mexican/ Southwest feel to it. They have a lot of traditional Mexican dishes as well as lunch combos. We did not finish our meals because of the amount of food. We are out of towners  and always search for really good Mexican food , this place did not disappoint. We liked the salsa verde but it was a little too salty for me but had nice heat. If you're in the mood for Mexican this place is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had here was quite tasty.  The more pedestrian enchilada, burrito, taco dishes you can get anywhere are what you expect from any Mexican restaurant.  However, where they shine is with some of their specialty dishes, fish tacos and shrimp tacos are terrific. Dare I say even by San Diego standards?  Their street taco menu is my favorite.  They offer beef, beef stomach, chorizo and other unique and tasty items.  Delivered with a little red onion, perhaps some cilantro and a wedge of lime,  they are inspired.  The reason for 4 stars is the service, not the fastest.  If you are in a lunch rush, plan to ask for the check when you get your meal.  The staff is, while slow, incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"Not good....one and done for our family.  Too many better options nearby to settle for mediocre Mexican."}
{"text":"Really tasty and outstanding fried ice cream.  Been back twice now and both times food was excellent."}
{"text":"I dont normally write reviews, but felt compelled to do so in this case.

My last meal was simply not up to par. Hey, sometimes these things happen. My previous meals have all been great, Better then anything I've gotten at Azteca, Monterray or any other Mexican Restaurant in this area.

While I normally don't like to complain, especially when I've had the same meal before and it was great and knowing again, that sometimes these things happen, I did. I first spoke to the Hostess who was very polite and understanding and then she grabbed the Owner, Diego.

Very nice very understanding. He obviously knows customer satisfaction is a top priority to any restaurants success, which is something far too many restaurants truly don't care about anymore. He genuinely wanted to know what the issue was so he could address the issue so it doesn't occur again.

And without me asking, or expecting it (I just wanted to let them know...I had no intention of asking for a refund etc..), he apologized and offered to either comp my meal, give a full refund or give a gift card, whichever I preferred. 

Knowing I'd be back, I accepted the gift card and was thankful he offered it. 

Its refreshing to know that there are still restaurants like this that actually care about their customers. Good luck getting that type of service at Monterray. The folks at Monterray act like they are doing you a favor by allowing you to eat there, which we don't anymore since the quality of their food has gone downhill and their service is awful.

I highly recommend people try Mi Pueblo if they haven't. The people are great, the food is excellent, large portions and reasonably priced and if you should happen to have an issue, which can happen at any restaurant, its nice to know they will go out of their way to make it right.

Good food, good prices, good service, good people, good management, good ownership. Best of all worlds."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food, atmosphere, and staff.  I had the fish tacos, and they were fantastic.  The staff was more than friendly, and our food took no time at all.  This will be added to our local favorites, and I look forward to going back and trying more off the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent salsa & cheese dip. Had the Texas fajita quesadilla and it was spot on"}
{"text":"The food here is very good, the service is inconsistent. The managers are nice, but ineffective. My first visit was on Valentine's Day!!!! Everything was awesome, including the service. The Guaca Chicken was outstanding. They execute the most amazing grilled chicken and their guacamole is delicious and fresh, fresh, fresh!!! On my second visit a couple weeks later it was a bit of a different experience. The server was the same person from our first visit, she barely returned to our table the entire time we were there. We planned to go to a movie afterwards, but everything took way longer than it should have. We found ourselves waving down other waitstaff to get drink refills, an extra napkin and then our check. That's where things got out of control. We were done with everything and sat waiting for our server to return so we could pay and head to the movie. After nearly 15 minutes, we asked another server, who said he would let her know. 10 minutes later, we had to leave our booth and request to speak to a manager. 10 more minutes passed and he finally arrived at our table. We explained what was going on and just needed our check. Movie was cancelled at this point. He apologized and began making excuses for her (mistake). I politely asked if he would print our check so we could leave. He agreed and left our table...never to return. Not kidding. He was clearing tables and rushing around the other end of the dining room. We waited another 10 minutes and I decided it was enough. We gathered our things and headed to the hostess stand. We asked if she could pull it up, if not we were leaving. We have now been in this restaurant for \"2 hours\" and pretty frustrated at this point. She said, \"yes, absolutely \". She went behind the counter and attempted to print out check, but actually couldn't print it. I said, we're leaving and unless you can produce a check, you're not getting paid for this meal. Apparently, the words \"we're not paying\" are the only words that get the attention of the manager. He rushed over and so did our server. She apologized, but honestly I was having none of it. They completely ruined our evening and I had a right to be upset. She produced our check. There was no offer of apologies from the manager or even a \"can we offer you a drink since your evening was railroaded\". We paid and for the \"first time ever\" left a ZERO tip. I've been in service for a very long time and I've had stern conversations with my husband about tipping and how hard service industry employees work. This time, I had no issue with my decision. It's just a terrible shame the service brings down their rating as I said, the food is very good and well executed. I say go if you're not in a hurry because the food is good. Wish I could have just tipped the kitchen in my last visit."}
{"text":"Coming from San Diego, I was not expecting much, but this place was solid! Sort of like an On the Border type of atmosphere and similar food options. I had the lunch fajitas with chicken and it came out so fast, I didn't even have time to gorge myself on chips (which was a good thing). The portion size was perfect and everything was tasty. The salsa was light and the chips were warm. My server was very friendly, so I was surprised by the poor service reviews. Definitely a great place to check out!"}
{"text":"Mi Pueblo is a great mexican restaurant - it has the traditional dishes but also new innovative dishes that are great!

My boyfriend and I came and ate at the bar. The service was great and the Maestro margaritas was well-crafted and reasonably priced. 

We had the new Dos Equis fish tacos and the guaca chicken. The fish tacos are made with haddock instead of tilapia which makes for a flaky tender taco that has a burst of flavor thanks to the Chipotle sauce. The guaca chicken is tender and full of flavor which we loved.

Overall Mi Pueblo is a great place to eat for a reasonable price and good food."}
{"text":"Enjoy going and appreciate the restaurant for what it is!  The beers are ice cold - I like it a little bit frozen unlike a previous reviewer.  I find the waiters cheerful, happy to serve but many find english a bit difficult - adds to the atmosphere!!  Food is good!  I go here regularly!"}
{"text":"I've recently changed my opinions of Me Pueblo.  I work very close by and most of my co-workers are big Mexican food fans, so I end up visiting fairly often. The food used to be sub par, but recently it has seemed to get better.  


The salsa they bring to the table is very hot, but you can request mild salsa instead, which is normally very tasty. The service is what can make or break this restaurant for me, and it is very spotty. Sometimes you get an excellent server and the food will come out quickly, but sometimes times you don't get so lucky. It's about 50-50 for me.  

Overall, it's okay for a cheap lunch or dinner. Good specials, and an overall friendly staff."}
{"text":"If you like Mexican food don't eat here. Tasteless chips served with the tiniest bowl of salsa possible. 
Had the super nachos, a plate of the no Taste chips, covered with thin grey refried beans no actual beans used. Unchewable pieces of no seasoning chicken, a handful of over cooked no taste ground beef. All topped with lettuce, tomato, onions, sour cream, and cold unmelted Mexican cheese. No ingredient was warm, or seasoned, no salt, no pepper, no Mexican spice or salsa. I couldn't ever imagine more unappetizing nachos. Just go to Azteca. Seriously, no taste, cold over cooked nasty meat."}
{"text":"Always a fan of MI Pueblo, never had a bad meal. Straight forward Mexican options, and it is a small North Carolina chain, my hometown has had one for years."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was nervous but this place a hidden gem. Friendly staff. Yummy cheese dip. Their ACP is awesome! The chips taste super fresh and salsa has a good kick. Cheese dip is some of the best! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Mi Pueblo is a nice looking Mexican restaurant with a lot of choices for food.  On any given night they have drink specials and the food is not expensive at all.  They have a nice seating area outside.  The staff is friendly.  As far as food, it's good but it's the same as an other Mexican Restaurants around.  The main thing that's sets Mi Pueblo apart is the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"This is by far, my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte! It is always so clean  and inviting. The service always seems to be well above average and I have loved every dish I've tried! My favorite has to be the ACP with grilled peppers and onions- I find myself craving this!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here a number of times and are happy every time! Favorite dish is the baked potato with steak. So delish! We planned a large group dinner of 30 people for our birthday and were pleased at the ease of it. They are able to accommodate large groups with no hassle. Portions are large and prices are fair. Only disappointment ever was in the deserts. Not worth it to even try."}
{"text":"Service was great, food and drink not so much. Ordered a Dos Equis draft and it was warm. Was told that cooling system was on the fritz but was then charged for the warm beer. Honest mistake. Ordered the street taco trio. I appreciated the fact that they tried but they still need some work. Street tacos should come with two tortillas each and the meat should not be dry. The attempt and the service earned three stars. The best I have found are still at El Paraiso in Monroe."}
{"text":"I pass by this place almost every day. I finally decided to give it a try last night. Within a few minutes of sitting down, a runner, I'm assuming, literally threw our tortilla chips on the table and almost slammed the salsa down as he just kept on walking. No \"Hello\", no \"here are your chips and salsa\", no nothing. My friend wanted to leave, but I thought maybe he was just having a bad day.

Then I saw the bag of trash sitting right there out in the open walkway. We decided to leave and go to Monterrey.

Adios, y'all."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Not super. Typical Mexican food. Service was okay. We went for dinner. Forgot what we ordered but it was a sampler tray with a little of everything. As many reviewers stated I wouldn't take a date out to eat here."}
{"text":"We used to LOVE this place & we went in there for a Sunday lunch dining experience. 
We ALWAYS sit at the bar so we can watch TV & it's just my hubby & I so we don't want to take up a table while they're busy!

We go in & she tells us there is a wait...
I said \"we are going to sit at the bar if that's okay\"
The hostess gave us the go ahead and we went and sat at the bar. 

There was another solo gentleman sitting at the bar with an adult beverage, chips & salsa & food... clearly had gotten service. 
We sat there...15 minutes later a server approached us & informed us they didn't have a bartender and they wouldn't serve us sitting at the bar??

We were appalled, obviously the other gentlemen got served...
& the hostess shouldn't of gave us the go ahead if we wasn't being served??
It makes no sense & why would they turn away our business. 

We ended up walking out & will absolutely never return. 
Not only were they rude about the situation but they won't ever get our business again. 

Good job on making pretty regular customers angry!"}
{"text":"Their food is great. The chips and dips are amazing! The servers are always awesome. The atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint...the service was really good,very friendly! I ordered a shrimp fajita,I was surprised how many prices of shrimp they gave me,over like 10 pieces..if you go to apple bees you might get lucky with only 4 pieces..so I really liked that..my fajita also came with rice lettuce and beans on the side..food tasted very fresh! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Mi Pueblo is one of our favorite spots for Mexican food. It stays pretty busy on Fri & Saturday but once you have a table you are served pretty quickly.  Staff is great and the food is even better.  Never disappointed when we go there."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are great and affordable. The salsa is full of flavor and spicy. I ordered the lunch chicken fajitas and it was more than enough. I ate outside on the patio and it is actually one of the nicest patios in Charlotte that is not rooftop. The fountain and atmosphere gives a nice relaxed, secluded feeling"}
{"text":"Now that I visited this restaurant a second time, while I wasn't sick, I ordered the DOS EQUIS FISH TACOS and they were fantastic, fresh, light, and delicious. My children smoked their kids menu enchiladas and chicken strips. My tacos were even just as good when I ate it 2 days later, but transferred it onto a different flour tortilla. Just toast the fish in the oven and done!"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon... needing a cold, cold Dos Equis and some apps... THIS is your place. Sat in the bar.. coldest, iciest beer I had in months. Nachos are awesome.. Chimi was awesome.. Staff was attentive and super on the ball.. winner winner nacho beer dinner!"}
{"text":"Started out with the customary fresh chopped and salsa. The salsa is h-o-t. Recommend side of queso derretido for an app. Generous portion. 
Clean! Clean bathroom!
Had the steak fajitas and they were *the best I ever had* hands down. 
Ordered the churros for desert. Delicious! So delicious, didn't take a picture before we dug in. Generous for 1. We split among five."}
{"text":"I've been to many Mexican restaurants, some have been forgettable, some are consistently good, the majority are average. I've only been to Mi Pueblos twice, but I've had good results both times. Service is quick; drinks and chips were on the table within a couple of minutes. I had no problem getting in and out for lunch under thirty minutes. The chips were decent, neither stale or fresh out of the fryer, and the salsa was good. You can always tell how the quality of a restaurant's salsa is just by the way it looks and smells, Mi Pueblo's is properly chunky and has that distinct smell of fresh cilantro. They pass the test. I hate when Mexican restaurants have bland rice, it's almost as if you're chewing nothing at all. Luckily theirs has enough spice and salt to complement the entree. The burrito is large, tasty, and the meat quality is good. The building looks clean and it's easy to tell that the management upkeep the building well. Just about everything was great. What I didn't like was their guacamole dip, too me it had an off-putting taste, and their queso was a little bland. I'd also appreciate a little more variety on their menu. They have the staples covered, but once you've been to an authentic Mexican restaurant it's just hard to settle for anything less. Overall, it's easy to recommend Mi Pueblo's, the service is great and the food is good."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Horrific 

After receiving the wrong take out order calling and complaining wasn't offered any compensation 

Finally spoke to the store manager and having to come into the restaurant to receive my refund upon doing so the employees claimed I was a liar and thief.. because the manager wasn't there literally calling me a liar and thief 

worst customer service I've ever experienced .  They also spoke down upon me assuming I didn't understand Spanish which made me think I wasn't the first"}
{"text":"Bottom line... 3.5 stars. Decent place to pick up a cheap lunch if you are in the area.

They have great prices for lunch ($6 to $8). While their lunch menu is limited in options, you can order a lunch portion of pretty much everything on their dinner menu. The Jerk Chicken (which doesn't scream Mexican to me) was highly recommended by staff. I personally wasn't too crazy about it. The pineapple/cheese sauce that the chicken was sitting on was cold (maybe it was supposed to be) and too sweet for my liking. The temperature contrast between the chicken and sauce didn't do it for me. My coworkers ordered the Arroz Con Pollo (ACP) and Cali Burrito and seemed to enjoy it. My biggest complaint... they charge 25 cents per take out item."}
{"text":"Being a resident of Afton Ridge, we've made several trips to Mi Pueblo. From impromptu dinner with friends to a quick bite at the bar, it's a solid choice for authentic Mexican cuisine.

First and foremost, clean! Out of the dozens of times we've been there, there has been once where a waitress brought us to a table that had been cleared but not wiped down yet. Not the best first impression but they took care of it immediately, and hey they were busy so no harm, no foul. Restrooms also look well tended to.

They start every table off with chips and salsa. The salsa is very fresh, but also very spicy! It lingers so be warned. They also have a really good queso on the appetizer menu.

My go-to dishes are the Guadalajara Special where you get tamales AND taquitos, topped with chicken, beef, and beans. Unless you've got a bottomless stomach you're probably going to leave with a doggie bag! Also good is the Enchiladas de Lujo, one each chicken, beef, refried beans, and cheese enchiladas, topped with red sauce, cheese, tomato, lettuce, sour cream, they may even throw in the kitchen sink if you ask!

Also, I know this is going to sound odd but one of the best things on the menu is just plain 'ol Cheese Quesadilla. I don't know what blend or type of cheese they use but it is the best cheese quesadilla I've ever had.

I did venture out on the last visit and tried the new 'Street Tacos' and lets just say I wasn't a fan. I ordered chicken, beef, and 'pork stomach'. I assumed pork stomach was pork belly, I guess I was wrong? It had a weird aftertaste, definitely not what I thought but not knocking it too much because maybe I shouldn't have made an assumption (or perhaps I could have asked my waiter, doh!). The beef street taco however was dry, very very dry. I had actually asked for a side of sour cream to try and add some moisture to no avail. I'll stick with my usual favorites from now on, or ask the waiter/waitress what they think of the specials!

Service is usually great, there is this older shorter gentleman who ALWAYS gives us fantastic service. I really wish I caught his name last time! Maybe 1 out of 4 visits we get someone who seems like they don't give a damn, but usually if I see our 'guy' I'll ask for him!

Authentic experience through and through, despite the last visit. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend any day of the week."}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant.  The food was tasty, and VERY affordable.

They have really delicious cheese dip.  The white stuff with peppers in it.  The salsa was extra tasty, too.  The staff was super friendly and very attentive.

They have figured out some magical way to make even refried beans taste better than most places.  I have tried tacos, enchiladas, and quesadillas here, and really liked everything."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars I would. Went here on a Sunday, based on the recommendation of a friend. The food was very good and tasty. The customer service was exceptional, with a very friendly staff.

Highlight of the visit. We leave, and we are outside in the parking lot talking for about 10-12 minutes. My wife says to me, \"where is your To-Go  food?\" I realized that I left it on the table. I run back in to see if I can obtain it. But of course they had already discarded it when they cleared the table. So the hostess tells me to speak to the manager about it, which I really didn't see the point in doing so. Spoke with him, and made it very clear it was totally my mistake and I was not pointing the finger at his staff. He insisted on providing me with another FRESHLY COOKED meal to take as my leftovers. Gave me the option getting what I already had or something different. Unbelievable!!! He went above and beyond. And I could sense he did it because he really wanted to, not begrudgingly.

I don't live on this side of town. But next time we have a craving for Mexican food we will go out of our way to come to this establishment."}
{"text":"First visit today. Excellent experience. The outdoor patio is beautiful complete with a large fountain, white lights on the ceiling, and music playing. 
Food was wonderful. Guaca Chicken, Fajitas and enchiladas/tacos. Everyone in our party of 5 enjoyed their food, including kids with chicken fingers. Geovanny was our server and provided excellent service!  We will be back."}
{"text":"The worst Mexican food I've had since moving to NC. Microwaved, salsa tasted like jar salsa not fresh made, tortilla chips tasted commercial, I wouldn't waste my time or $ here."}
{"text":"Just your average Mexican restaurant. Better than Las Margaritas but definitely not the best Mexican you've ever had. Cool for what it is, but not all that. However, I've been back a couple times as I have yet to find better bang for your buck Mexican here in Charlotte. You can fill up on a good meal here for cheaper than Chipotle. The salsa is really good. Service is always good too. And they have a free ice cream cone machine, that's a plus."}
{"text":"They put us (2 people) in a huge both right behind the hostess. The whole time we are eating the employees and manages are leaning against our booth talking (in spanish) being so loud they should also remember that some people know spanish and can understand them. 

Altho our server ( Junior ) was so nice and polite and tried to make our experience better he is the only reason they are getting 2 starts! I will go back just to get his table! 

Food was very good ; alcohols was strong"}
{"text":"Love this place so much! I've only been twice but my food has been delicious each time!! This place definitely has not made the Mexican food \"Tex-Mex.\" It tastes authentic and the flavoring is great. Service is fast and friendly. The chalupas and fajitas are great options! My number one choice for Mexican in this area, hands down."}
{"text":"Best Mexican on this side of town.  Good service, clean, flavorful food.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the worst service I've ever received and for his place they didn't have far to go down. Hunger insisted we eat here instead of going to another restaurant further away.  We waited patiently to be seated but had 3 staff bickering at the hostess stand in Spanish about where to seat us and I tell you it was unproffessional and offputting. We get seated and wait 10 min for someone to talk to us but they stared at us enough to know we were here. Above that, the table is ridiculously slanted. We should have just said adios. Oh, and it was 4 pm on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Good service, food came out quick and fresh. I had the lunch fajitas and my husband had the lunch acp and they were both good. Just recommend coming for lunch so you have the rest of the day to digest the food since portions are big. After speaking with my husband he recommends not sitting at the booths unless you like playing seesaw with the person on the other side lol"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. Each time, the food was very delicious. The portions are large and very fresh (piping hot). Each time, the manager also came to my table to check up on us, which (in my opinion) is a very respectable gesture. I felt very welcome and enjoyed myself on both occasions.

I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I went in for a quick lunch and it was very good. The place was very nice on the inside and clean. Even though they were slow, the servers were attentive to all their tables. I had a wonderful California lunch burrito for under $10 and it was more than enough food for me. Also, major key  salsa was not from a jar or bottle. Too good to not be made in house. Definitely will go again and bring my friends and family next time!"}
{"text":"The new street taco menu is a nice addition and offers a good selection of fillings, including beef tongue, carne asada, carnitas, camarones and more. Whenever I tell the family we are going out for Mexican dinner the kids scream Mi Pueblo. This restaurant always delivers great service and fresh, tasty food. On our last visit we had a great server named Alfredo."}
{"text":"The food is always very good and the manager is very professional. Any problems that I have ever had over the years was responded to and resolved. The nachos are my favorite and the red hot salsa is out of this world. They also have great drink specials! The environment in warm and inviting so if you are reast for some great Mexican food, head to Mi Pueblo!"}
{"text":"Someone was in the mood for Margarita and a 30% off coupon had been dropped in our mailbox so there you have it.

Food:  nondescript, generic and messy. There's a very good reason this chain thrives deep in the Carolinas : the owners know what most people around here like (hint: it ain't real Mexican food).  Jerk chicken a Mexican signature dish ... can people even locate Mexico on a map? yeah the menu has Italian, Hawaiian, and Jamaican, what a joke. 

Margaritas: meh! Tasted like like coolaid and tequila, some of the worst margarita mix I ever had. 

Service : really bad, not just because our waiter suffered from ADD - which he did.  In a nearly empty restaurant, with a dozen employees in sight doing nothing it still took 30 minutes to get our first drink - and I had to get up and grab someone for it to happen. 

Finally the whole restaurant is an incredibly ugly mishmash of smeared walls, crude carpentry and assorted poor design choices. I'm left with nothing good to say about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome food very affordable.  Beautiful
Ambiance and the waitress from Venezuela was outstanding.   Great piña colada.  Recommend to try it"}
{"text":"This is my fav place to go eat mexican when I do not want to spend too much money. Food is cheap and beer is cheap on weekdays. They serve it in an ice cold glass. So refreshing!

I always get the veg tamales. SO good. Always have left overs and eat it for breakfast. Service is pretty good. Got to try the salsa verde, Got a great kick to it."}
{"text":"A solid 4 star Mexican meal.  Considering the location and modern look, I expected it to be \"Americanized\" and or pricy but it was neither.   GREAT food served fast and surprisingly cheap.  Dinner for two including sodas and a dessert was under $30.   

My wife hade a bean and cheese burrito (you can't mess that up) and I had the beer battered fish tacos - they were amazing!  I've had hundreds of fish tacos and these were some of the best.

Be sure to ask for the full selection of hot salsas if you dare."}
{"text":"The food at Mi Pueblo is really good, as is the wait staff. They have a variety of options that are available at most Mexican restaurants, but the food here seems to be of higher quality. 

That being said, the reason I'm rating them 3 out of 5 is because their take-out service is severely mismanaged. My wife and I place orders on a weekly basis and they get something wrong most of the time. I've brought it to management before and they've worked to make it right. That said, the take-out orders we make continue to have something wrong with them. For example, tonight, there was no salsa included with our chips and a hole was torn out of the top of my soup cup. When we got it home, soup was all over the inside of the bag. Hopefully, they pay attention to this detail of their business moving forward."}
{"text":"Find another Mexican restaurant!! You will be sorely disappointed in this place. We have had 3 different servers none of which could speak enough English to correctly understand and serve our order. The food is less than mediocre and the service is very slow. We have been here on 5-10 occasions and this will be our last; no more second chances!! Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Mi Pueblo is a decent spot for lunch since there are lunch specials where you can get a taco, enchilada, and rice for $5 plus tax! I personally wouldn't come to Mi Pueblo for dinner or anything special.

They start you off with the typical chips and salsa - the salsa is on the spicier side and the chips are quite thick. Not the usual thinner, 'cantina-style' chips served at most Mexican restaurants. Whenever I've dined there, the waiters/waitresses have always been courteous and willing to go over any menu item and make any needed adjustments to meals.

Whenever I do stop in on my lunch break, I normally order the \"speedy gonzalez:\" choice of enchilada and soft (or hard) taco served with rice. It's very filling and leaves you satisfied, especially since you were able to enjoy all of that (plus beverage!) for under $6. I've also had the chicken fajitas which are served very generously.

The last time I was there, I was craving chicken tortilla soup. I asked the waitress if they served it and she told me that she had never even heard of it! I was kind of surprised since it's a soup that's normally served at chain Mexican restaurants. Needless to say, no chicken tortilla soup was offered so don't go there expecting any."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Our waiter was a comedian with great service. His name was Filepe."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant in the Charlotte area, and we've tried many places in the past 7 years since we've moved here. This is a real gem in a sea of mediocre to bad Mexican restaurants. It's hard to go wrong here, but my favorite is the guaca chicken."}
{"text":"Everything fresh and the beef nachos are so good that they were gone before I could take a picture!
Great place !"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Had the chicken & it's mixed with grilled peppers and onions which gave the taco some girth. Great guacamole & much better than cheap generic Mexican restaurants. However, while we were there, a police officer came in and went back to the kitchen. Another officer came in & they escorted an employee out. Was sketchy. Walked outside to leave & cop cars parked at entrance. Had 5 people outside arguing with police. Ummmm......"}
{"text":"Such a great experience for the hubby and me.  Went here tired, hot, and sweaty after the PGA and had such a nice dinner.  Margharitas were phenomenal and fresh.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Everything was on point. From the salsa and chips to the flan. Service excellent too. Plus they made the food picante enough for my Mexican boyfriend, which can be hard to do!"}
{"text":"Now this is authentic Mexican food ! i love the service and the food is great ! I love coming here and trying different things each time im never disappointed ."}
{"text":"Been in more times than I can count. They never disappoint! Staff is so friendly and their food and drinks are always good!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, warm service and beautiful ambience.  My husband and I dined on the patio. We loved the fountains,  which drowned out the sound of traffic amd made us feel very relaxed. The guacamole was fresh and flavorful and the fish tacos were some of the best I've had in Charlotte.  Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"The taste of the food was good, but it was barely warm.  The service was terrible.  We had to find the waiter any time we needed something.  We were almost through our meal before the sour cream we ordered was brought out."}
{"text":"We had the most pleasant (and funny) experience for lunch at this restaurant. A friend and myself went for a late Sunday afternoon lunch and had a hankering for Mexican food! We were greeted by the funniest hostess that chatted a minute with us before taking us to our table. Our hostess took our drink orders and when he came back he chatted and joked with us while we decided what to order! When our actual waiter came, the two engaged in playful banter and had us laughing hysterically! 

The chips and salsa were unlimited, and by unlimited I mean they DO NOT LET the chips get close to running out before refilling it! The food came out quickly and they easily modified menu items to our liking without complaint. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because even though they didn't have many dining in the restaurant it was difficult to find someone to fill our drinks and bring the check after our food was delivered!  When in the area, I would dine here again!"}
{"text":"This is Americanized Mexican food. You are much better off going to a dime a dozen Mexican restaurant served by real Mexicans.  They are much cheaper and taste far better. Our waiter was enthusiastic but not very helpful. When I asked for recommendations, he pointed to every picture on the menu. Uh, that doesn't tell me anything. I ordered the chimichanga and my sister got the charcoal chicken.  She said the black beans were good.  We got the guacamole appetizer.  My sister thought it was made table side, but this ain't that type of spot. The guacamole was OK, but the flour tortilla chips that came with it were terrible. They were doughy and needed to be cooked longer.  The only half decent thing was the margarita. For almost $10, it is a large drink.  It would be the only thing I'd ever order again but I don't ever plan to return. The waiter and the manager (?) came by the table and asked, \"The food was good??\". I said it was alright but they didn't really care if I enjoyed the food or not anyway.  There were some folks there and some seemed to be regulars so I guess they have a market. But for this first-timer, it is a last-timer for me. Bottom line: you can get much better food for a lot less money (well under the $25 I paid)."}
{"text":"Time well spent! Food was spectacular! Kitchen did a really nice job! They were super busy but our food was prompt and sooooo yummy! Looking forward to the next go round!"}
{"text":"The food and service is always great! The California burrito and the fajita quesadilla are my favorites an they are great for sharing. The chicken tortilla soup is wonderful if u want a soup. And the fresh guacamole is my favorite dip."}
{"text":"The first time we stumbled in here was simply an accident. It was storming in Charlotte on the day that my parents had decided to come for a visit, and the power was out all over town. After a failed attempt at Chili's, I told them that I thought there was an Olive Garden right down the road. Now, don't ask me why I thought it was an Olive Garden...but we ended up at Mi Pueblo and since we all three could eat Mexican for every meal, decided to give it a shot.

So today when they made a surprise visit again, we wanted Olive Garden, but none were nearby and we weren't backtracking to the one in Pineville, so we decided to venture back to Mi Pueblo. Now, we couldn't even remember the name of the place, and honestly the only thing we did remember was that we were freezing from being soaked from the rain and under a vent while we ate. But I did remember us leaving and talking about how amazing the food was.

I am so glad that we randomly ended up there because of my poor memory because it is some of the best Mexican I've had. Tonight I had the Hawaiian Chicken, which reminded me of a dish I had at a place in Anderson, SC that was so good I could have slapped my mama, so I thought I'd see if this even compared. Yes. It. Did. And holy moly! $11 and I can make 3 meals easy off of it. My parents both got chimichangas, one beef and one chicken, and thank the stars I made off with their leftovers so I'm in Mi Pueblo heaven for the rest of the week. I also had to get a round of sopapillas before we left since I am a freak for them. No disappointment there. And only $2.80 for a heaping plate full of that goodness.

For the amount of DELICIOUS food you get, the prices are actually really cheap. If you think they are expensive, you need to go back to the 50s.

Oh, and the HOMEMADE salsa is some of the best you will put in your mouth. I just hate that you have to request mild and you just get a little bowl instead of a full bottle."}
{"text":"Mexican chains are Mexican chains are Mexican chains.  Close your eyes and guess where you are. I don't think you will be able to tell. What separates Mi Pueblo is the atmosphere.  Deanna and I had lunch on an open air courtyard that was roofed in and had a beautiful waterfall fountain.  We loved our server;  he was efficient and personable.   He gets a five star rating and his photo is included in this review.  The chips and salsa came first.  Bland salsa.  I should have asked for one with a better kick.  Thanks to my check-in on YELP, we got a free queso. Hurray to this restaurant for taking care of Yelpers!   My tamales were fair.  They were nothing super special.  The rice and beans were your same old rice and beans.   I have been to Mexico several times and know what authentic Mexican food is.  For the life of me, I wish I could find it in Charlotte.   There is definitely a place for Tex-Mex chains, but they are all over the place.   Bring on the real deal Mexican food.  Go to Mi Pueblo for great atmosphere and a good time.  I am betting most palettes would give this a better rating, but I call it the way I taste it.  And that's just the way it is."}
{"text":"My family loves Mexican food and we were pretty disappointed in this location. The waiter was awkward and not very personable. They sat us in this awkward corner by the bar. We ordered queso and it was very liquidy. The food was alright. The meat on the tacos was very fatty. I ordered the carne asada which was pretty good especially for the price. If you've ever had homemade soft corn tortillas then you'll be very put off by the ones they serve. Overall I don't see us returning in the future."}
{"text":"Everyone has their go to Mexican food place and this is definitely mine. I love the dos quis fish tacos and their ACP. Their place is always clean and it is a nice big space even with out side seating. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Pretty restaurant on the outside and entrance.  Lot of places to sit even outside with water feature and flat screens.  The service is usually attentive even with take out but not that friendly.  The food is tasty but not the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"We really like Mi Pueblo.  We have always had excellent service, attentive and friendly.   Although it is not on the menu, my husband and I have frequently asked them to make a shrimp ceviche tostada which is SO good.  Really, that is the #1 thing that keeps us coming back, I think!"}
{"text":"Dos Equis Fish Tacos were great & hubby has always loved the Burrito al Carbon.  Wish the salsa was heavy on cilantro.

Won't hold it against the restaurant but screaming misbehaving kids is a pet peeve and ruins my experience!"}
{"text":"Five of us came here for dinner last night. Fresh chunky guacamole was great,  as were entrees and sangria margarita. Best of all was the server.....Excellent! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican spot in Charlotte the menu is very big and almost everything is good me and my family eat here very often at least once a week service is always good the price is reasonable the portions are huge and the margaritas are very tasty I often get the guaca chicken my mom gets the tequila chicken both are very good the salsa and queso are homemade and the best in the city"}
{"text":"The fish tacos were the best we'd all ever had, the enchiladas were yummy, and the dessert was really well presented and delicious."}
{"text":"The place has a nice ambiance, tasty food, and friendly service. My friend with me has been several times, while this was my first time there. He got a combo plate and I got fajitas. The thing that I noticed was the tortillas I got were much larger than I get at other places, so big bonus points. As I said, the food was very good. I would return."}
{"text":"Good chips and queso. Horrible everything else. I didn't even like the salsa, which was fresh but had too many chile peppers. Everything on my lunch platter looked and tasted like cafeteria food. My pork tamale was covered in a bland ground beef sauce. The tap water didn't taste good either. Service was all right. I felt really blah all afternoon after eating here. Go to Biombos instead."}
{"text":"Service was quick and the food was plentiful. You can't go wrong with the daiquiries. You should also get the house special."}
{"text":"Met with friends for a birthday dinner. I had the guaca chicken which was very tender and tasty. I also had the upgraded margarita which was just OK. The chips were stale and given our group size we ran out and had to wait AWHILE for more chips and more salsa. The salsa was nothing special. The guacamole dip was nothing special (not even sure if it was recently prepared). It is a mediocre Mexican restaurant. I don't plan to be back, but wouldn't balk if friends insisted. Apparently there are coupons for this place (which I didn't know until one of the dinner guests shared with another) so I'd look for that as the prices weren't cheap but weren't expensive either."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food 
Cold beer and great margaritas. What else do you want from a Mexican restaurant? They had a difficult time with the free cheese dip coupon but I expected it based on previous reviews."}
{"text":"Best in town if they'd stop serving stale chips. Food is excellent."}
{"text":"Have passed this place a couple of times while in Concord on business. Walked in at 8:15pm, was promptly seated but that was it. A guy finally brought the complimentary chips and salsa but not one sever came to the table and there were maybe 6 tables occupied. I simply got up, told the hostess and left. Horrible customer service and will certainly not waste my time or money in a place like this. If you expect to at least be greeted in the first 15 mins after you sit down, this is not the place."}
{"text":"My favorite local Mexican restaurant! I went here on my birthday this year and many other times with friends and family. The dos xx fish tacos are the bomb! I get them almost every time and the I wash it down with one of their gigantic 25oz dos xx drafts! All around this is a great place. Always have good service, good parking, no waiting, fast service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"GREAT MEXICAN. We have been searching Charlotte for a place with good flavor that has good atmosphere, service and margaritas and we found it. Not expensive, they use shredded beef in enchiladas, awesome salsa and our service was great. Highly recommend! Prices very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Never.again. We used to enjoy this place for mediocre food that satisfied a quick craving but combo of bad service and bad food that just peaked on our last visit has me done. To start, place was practically empty, but service was painfully slow. Chorizo dip took forever to come out, was watery, and he didn't bring chips with dip, which they are supposed to bring out complimentary chips and salsa while you wait anyway and that never happened so we stared at our soupy dip for like 5 minutes while bored wait staff just wandered around. When our food came out the cook has accidentally put ALL our orders in to-go containers and instead of the waiter correcting it he just brought it to our table that way and said \"sorry he messed up,,but hey your food won't run around plate\"...at this point I just wanted to get out of there FAST so there my husband and I sat side by side at a sit down restaurant eating our meals out of foil to-go containers!Still trying to be optimistic and basically starving I start eating my enchiladas and the sauce is just so watery and flavorless, despite indicating on menu melted cheese I detected nothing and they messed up my fillings. I pointed this out to waiter and he just looks at me and says \" you want cup of cheese sauce to dump on enchilada?\" \"Noooo., I wanted a cheese enchilada , not a chicken...\" to which he again asked the same question. He clearly did not want to have to put another order in but after a minute or two of this back and forth I finally made clear \" yes, I want you to correct my order and give me what I initially asked for.\" Now I'm just ready to go. He has blown us off the whole time and not seemed to care that everything was screwed up and never offered to take anything off bill or offer free dessert,you know, the usual when a place messes up this bad from start to finish for no good reason. He asked if we were \" in town for speedway\" to which we quickly replied with stomachs that are quickly cramping up from the few bites of watery garbage we managed to swallow \" no we lived locally\" Now suddenly he wants to talk our ear off and won't go away seeing we were not fly by night tourists ( not that it should matter) and all I want is the bill and to get the heck out of there as fast as we can. We finally made our escape and my leftovers went straight in garbage. So incredibly disappointed, never going back, Taco Hell would have been a step up from this place."}
{"text":"I still love the food after I gave this place another chance.  The grief I have  now is I noticed last night as I was picking up my to go order that they have started charging to take  the food out.  I don't like that I'm coming to pick up my own food and I'm being charged, not cool.  When I asked about the charge, it couldn't be explained to me. I don't think I'll be doing take out any more."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch. The food is quite good, and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Extremely SALTY Margarita's!!!  Not sure what else was in it tasted very acidic. Could not even drink half of it. Waste of $10. Chips were nothing but crumbs, cheese dip had no flavor. . Dinner came and smelled like rotten vegetables, took one bite and was sick. Spent $36 just on my check to be miserable. Stick with Monterrey."}
{"text":"This is a place I like to take people. Nice ambience and friendly staff. I haven't found a dish I didn't enjoy. Their cilantro pops!"}
{"text":"7 people in group, 4 had chicken fajitas and all 4 hated them! Lots of uncooked green peppers, very little chicken, one sliver of onion and whole thing tasteless! Side plate had one teaspoon of guac mixed in with lettuce, no cheese and no pico. Waiter didn't speak english so communication was a problem and request were ignored! This place is off the list."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this restaurant!!! They make some of the best Mexican dishes I have ever tasted. Awesome bartenders and friendly staff. Order the California Burrito!!"}
{"text":"I walked in and was immediately hit with the wafting scent of their endless, fresh tortilla chips. While delicious, I must point out that calling \"endless\" is false advertising. The kitchen can run out! For my meal I ordered the Burrito Mexicano. It came out in about five minutes. What was on my plate can only be described as burrito pudding. A tasty burrito drenched in melted cheese, refried beans, and shredded lettuce sat on my plate. After 3 minutes, the burrito genocide was complete and there was no longer any proof the Burrito ever existed to begin with. For dessert we had fried ice cream. All I can say is \"goodbye friends\" as I want to kill myself because the pain of knowing I will never have such a delicious Mexican meal again is too much to bear. But I'm not going to because the rice was pretty bland."}
{"text":"Wish I could do a 3.5, but I can't do I'll give it a 3. The food was very good, proportions were unbelievably large. The reason I gave it a 3 and not a 4 was because the wait staff while bring nice they weren't really sufficient on our needs. We had to wait a good amount of time for chips, water, and refills.the waiter seemed to always be in a hurry to get things so slow."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went here a few months ago. We wanted to try some good Mexican food, and we got it.

When we first walked in, the floors, the ceilings, the chandeliers.. everything was beautiful. But it was so slow. The service was ok, I ordered a Steak Quesadilla and it was freaking huge. He said it only had Steak and cheese in it, but they had put green peppers and onions in. I'm a fan of those two ingredients, but it just looks bad when you can't remember what comes in an item.

Despite everything being huge, the food was delicious and it came fast. The price was also great. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place was horrible, service was average but my tacos were dry and tasted awful.  Would not recommend to my enemy"}
{"text":"I have to stop going to this place. In there twice a week. Nothing I have tried has been a  disappointment. Service is great just wish they served coke products."}
{"text":"Really good food, great value, nice staff. First time here and will definitely go back. The amount and quality of the food make it worth the trip."}
{"text":"We'd been waiting for the new restaurant to open and were excited to see the pretty building being used again.  We'd never heard of Mi Pueblo, but we like Mexican and the menu online looked good, so we decided to give it a try.  The parking lot was full, but were still seated immediately, which was a pleasant surprise.  It was Sunday and the noise level was higher than I'm accustomed to, but besides that, it was welcoming and the interior was interesting to look at.  The wait staff were literally running back & forth, but they were polite and did a fantastic job of keeping our glasses filled.  Medina was our server, and though he was busy, he kept checking back and making us feel welcomed  :-)

I had the Enchiladas Rancheras and they were excellent!  Cheesy enchiladas, chicken with onions and peppers, and enchilada sauce on top served with black beans and rice = super yummy!  I also got some sour crème and pico de gallo to really make mine pop!

My fella got the make your own combination: a burrito, a hard taco, and an enchilada - all beef.  His also came with the obligatory rice and beans, and his was also yummy and satisfying...  He shared some of my sour crème to make it even better  :-)

The complimentary salsa was fiery hot.  It wasn't my favorite, but it was tasty enough when paired with enough sweet tea to cool my tongue down! 

The thing I like most about Mi Pueblo, and the reason that we'll go back is because their pico de gallo doesn't have any cabbage in it!!  Pico de gallo shouldn't have cabbage in it and a bunch of local places in Charlotte (the multiple Aztecas & Don Pedros) have cut so many corners now that what they call pico de gallo is nothing more than a small plate of cabbage with onions and a couple of tomato chunks.  Pico de gallo is my favorite thing and the main reason I eat in Mexican restaurants, so to find a place that hasn't ruined it really made my day!  :-)  Thanks Mi Pueblo, for opening a new place in Charlotte  :-)"}
{"text":"Great food and service - food was nicely seasoned, well cooked, and presented. Large portions!"}
{"text":"For a brief time, this building was occupied by a different restaurant (if memory serves, it was Johnny Carino's, but it was gone so quickly, I don't recall). Regardless, shortly after building, they were gone, and not too long after, Mi Pueblo came in, remodeled and opened as a generally Mexican-themed establishment.

Though overall the place looks pretty - not really Mexican, but not horrible to look at - you are probably best off if you look around, perhaps snap a few shots for Instagram if that's your thing, and leave.

There is plenty of room here on just about any occasion, and that could be one of their downfalls. I don't know if they are ever properly staffed, but when we have been, they just don't seem to be able to provide particularly good service.

Their web site says they have eleven locations (one coming soon), so I think they would be pretty good at this item if they have so many, but what I have personally experience, and seen in other reviews? Not so much. You get your requisite chips and salsa and everything else goes downhill fast. Take a trip to New York and practice hailing taxis, as that skill will come in handy when getting someone back to your table.

When you eventually get your food - not what most would expect at a \"Mexican\" restaurant - it's decent enough, but probably not enough to merit a return trip. Something out of the ordinary, and perhaps more than enough to decide to avoid Zaxby's across the parking lot? Sure. But to detour from Azteca or La Unica, not too far away? Probably not."}
{"text":"I appreciate the Yelp offer of a free cheese dip. That was delicious! Thank you. Although the waiter was quite confused about the coupon he honored it after checking with his manager. There is the cutest patio outside that is completely enclosed and there is a water fountain wall that is quite pretty. However it was a little too hot for me to sit on the patio. It is really cute inside. There is a vast margarita menu and hey specialize in jalapeño margaritas but I opted for the Panther Rita which is Panther blue wig black rock salt and definitely delicious. The food was typical Mexican resturaunt though and nothing to write home about. It's strange that they do not offer sides with the meals as most Mexican places do. I won't make a special trip to come here but if I was in the area I would not be opposed."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars
I thought this was a pretty decent restaurant as far as mexican restaurants go.  As soon as you sit down they serve you chips and salsa.  The tortilla chips are smoking hot and salty.  Delish.  I took my grandmother here and we sat on the patio.  The patio has a great atmosphere and a light-up waterfall that creates a great background noise.  We each ordered a margarita and rec'd a jumbo marg.  I'm not complaining, but if I were only wanting a small margarita I would have sent this one back and asked for the smaller size.  The quality of the marg was wonderful.  It wasn't over bearingly sweet and had a nice flavor of tequila.  I think they use a higher quality than your average mexican restaurant.  The guacamole was ok.  Nothing exceptionally special about it.  It could have used a little more spices and a little less raw onions.  The chips that come with the guacamole were wonderful.  They are the same fried tortillas that they use on the sopapillas (the dessert nachos).  
I had a cheese quesadilla and a chicken enchilada.  The portion of chicken used in the enchilada and my grandma's taco was fairly large.  It was all pretty good.  We had the sopapillas to finish everything off and they were delicious.  They are drizzled with a strawberry syrup and cinnamon sugar and topped with whipped cream.  Super healthy.  Overall not a bad choice.  Decent food and a great atmosphere coupled with a jumbo margarita make for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Horrible, slow service. The \"cooks\" need to know about new items on the menu, and their accompaniments. Complimentary chips that are brought out are cold and stale. I would gladly pay for freshness. The wait staff clearly do not think that Americans know Spanish, as they talk about you, yards away. I've got something for you... I'll pay for my $20 meal and drinks with a $100 bill just to show you that I have the money to tip, but leave nothing on the table for you, since it was not earned"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants to go to if it is Mexican food you are craving. Muy Bueno! This means very Good! This south of the border cuisine has it all.Great place  to bring your family. Wonderful service. You will be hard pressed to pick something on the menu,due to the fact that it all looks so good. We were with a big group and they provided our own private room. The steak fajitas are a must. I had the enchilada supreme, this is a plate with five different enchiladas.Wow! You will not leave this place hungry or disappointed. This is my personal guarantee!"}
{"text":"I visit here about once a week for dinner. I usually get take out and it's very fast. The 3 hard tacos are a basic yet delicious option or sometimes I like the chicken fajita quesadilla.  It's great because it's so big, it's 2 meals in q. The left overs for lunch the next day are just as good as the dinner. They chips are a thicker tortilla chip but have great flavor. The salsa has a kick, I really like the spicier salsas so it's great for me."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic and drinks were great. Our waiter was very nice and suggested the best specials for the day as soon as we sat down. Food was delicious and the restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"I am a frequent guest, and I LOVE THIS PLACE.  The food is delicious, and everything is such a great price!

The homemade, fresh guacamole is great! Everything I have tried here is amazing. The salsa can be spicy at times, but I love spicy. There queso has a buttery flavor, and so yummy. The chicken tacos and chicken fajitas are also great. Honestly, they have quality food!  

I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Waited an hour for our food after ordering. Service wasn't that great, no refills offered - including the salsa. And then at checkout their credit card machines were down. This lunch took almost 3 hrs. Food is decent but it was cold by the time we got it. Manager didn't offer us anything to compensate for these things. Don't go if there's more than 4 in your party. What a terrible place to celebrate Mothers Day!"}
{"text":"There seems to be two schools of thought on this restaurant. Folks either love it or hate it.
Put me clearly in the love it camp.
First this is a very attractive building. It just looks like a great place to dine. Every one we met went out of their way to make us feel welcome and to help us enjoy our meal.
We started with large Margaritas and they sure were. Very tasty and with chips and salsa a great start. We ordered four different meals. Each was very nicely presented and very tasty. Each had a lot of flavor yet none went over the top. We enjoyed our meals very much. Portions were big without being overwhelming. When the bill was presented we were happily surprised.  Even with the drinks our bill was very reasonable. 
We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"My first review for this restaurant, although I've been eating here for the past 2-3 years. They took over from an Italian chain. When they first opened, everything was cool: attentive, friendly, even enthusiastic servers, good food and beer, good prices. Gradually, it appears that the managers/staff who originally opened the place have moved on. The result has been (in general) inconsistent service and food. 

There are still a couple of great servers there, and if you get one of them, you'll have a pleasant experience. This past week, I ordered a chicken burrito for part of my meal; the burrito itself was fine but the sauce tasted disconcertingly like Ragu spaghetti sauce. (it should be noted, though, that they have the best salsa in town that I've found so far!) To top off the general decline, they raised their prices a couple of months ago.  As time passes, I'm finding fewer and fewer reasons to go back. Aside from hiring more enthusiastic servers, the one thing they could do to get back on track would be to get a little inventive with the menu. There's really nothing there that's different from any other Mexican restaurant in town, and what is different does not taste distinctive. How about getting back to basics -- street tacos, tortas, tlayudas, tostados?"}
{"text":"I went for lunch and ordered a rice dish with veggies and pork. I was disappointed with the dish because it was covered in a cheese sauce. I didn't realize when I ordered it that it came with cheese.  I blame myself for not paying attention. I also didn't like that the chunks of pork were so big.  I'll update this review when I return and order a completely different dish."}
{"text":"My chips weren't stale at all.  And the salsa was great.
They smiled very happily through my fathers very, very broken spanish and responded with sweet things he didn't remotely understand.  
The service was quick and courteous - not in a lingering, fake-friendly way, which I appreciate.  They had a lot of fresh veggie and grilled items not typically found on your run of the mill mexican menu.  My food was well done and everyone I was with was happy as well - even my parents who can be picky.  Will absolutely go back."}
{"text":"No bueno! What's going on w/ this place? They have decent chips, salsa, rice, and beans. They know how to make the basic Mexican staples that I look for when I go to a Mexican restaurant (real tamales, chorizo on the menu, etc.). However, someone behind the scenes is making ruinous decisions about the food. They took mediocre burritos and tacos (on the bland side) that would have been boosted up by real cheddar and sour cream and instead chose to slather them with American cheese and some weird unidentifiable white sauce. The result was bordering on inedible. They made some other strange mistakes too - I asked for a cheese chili relleno and instead received one stuffed with ground beef and a couple other mix ups like that. Overall we were completely disappointed with our food and felt that we wasted our money."}
{"text":"I loved the food here. The atmosphere was great and Josh was an excellent server. The margaritas are delicious, as well."}
{"text":"Third time visiting this restaurant and each visit more unpleasant. 

1st visit: they got our order completely wrong. Made a Fajita burrito with ground beef instead of steak (weird).

2nd visit: ordered a margarita and asked for 1800 as the liquor instead of Jose. Received a margarita (with Jose) and a shot of 1800 on the side. (Really weird).

3rd visit: (tonight) the fajitas were the saltiest thing I have ever eaten in my life.

Won't be going back here."}
{"text":"This restaurant have a lot the flavor and service last time the waitress tell me .can you decide fast because i have others table to service. We just have seat horrible service even the place is not full. Sad sad sad  now  me and my friends  really go skip this place"}
{"text":"This is a \"chain\" restaurant, though there are not any other of these in the area. I normally am not a fan of chain restaurants, but the personal service and friendly staff here are all the reason to make an exception!

Decor is great, and makes you feel like you are back in Mexico. There is a wide variety of items to choose from the menu.

Quality of food was excellent. You would be hard-pressed to find better in the greater Charlotte area, in my opinion. The food had a full, fresh flavor without tasting heavy or greasy. You get more than your money's worth -- you won't leave hungry, that's for sure!

I believe the food may be authentic, or at least very close. Great find in the heart of Matthews. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Mi Pueblo,  MI Pueblo...

Your salsa is spicy , seasoned quite nicely.  I liked the outdoor patio seating , this is what attracted me from the road as I was driving by ...

I really feel I will have to come back and try anther dish to give mi pueblo a better review . I wasn't too thrilled with my order of shrimp fajitas , it didn't have that fajita   seasoning I am accustomed to , but hey I'm not a Mexican food foodie . I did notice they had an interesting brunch menu for Sunday,  I'm looking forward to sampling it,  who doesn't love a yummy brunch? I shall be back !"}
{"text":"Horrible experience,  manager was unfamiliar with new brunch law.      I feel as a restaurant manager you'd be aware of the laws.  He was more interested in arguing with the customer    Food was served cold and they werent busy at all.  I will not be returning.    I recommend elsewhere for your mexican cravings!!!"}
{"text":"Let me get started the food is plain American Mexican, we wanted to set on the patio the hostess said it was not open, so we took a table and then watched the hostess set people on the patio(wtf), The beer on special was sold out, no replacement, tortilla chips are stale, 2nd batch was over fried and grease, the pork carnitas did not have any flavor, black beans so bland, the rice was like eating plastic from setting in the hot well, we had to wave down other servers to get our drinks and of course she took offense to that, sorry bad service is what it is, next thing was the AC unit started dripping on us, told server she brought us more napkins, thanks, did not offer to move us, I guess that revenge for asking other servers to help us, I would not recommend this place to anyone, why can't a Mexican place be athletic, instead of American/Mexican crap"}
{"text":"This place takes me back to Cancun.. I love the food, atmosphere, and the environment. the interior is very Mexican like, good vibes..the staff is friendly and quick to serve."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant around. This is going to sound strange but their baked potatoes are fantastic! After hearing me rave about the for so long, my husband finally broke down and ordered the one with steak, as did a friend we were with and they agreed that they are delicious. I believe they are call Papa Mixta on the menu and have cheese sauce, pivotal de gallo, sliced avocado and choice of chicken or steak on top.

Recently I tried their chilequiles and they are another great choice. The sauce was a little saltier than I would like bu I will definitely order again. I like that you can order 1/2 pitcher of margaritas and I LOVE the outdoor seating. 

I've read comments about poor service and occasionally we get a server who isn't so great at customer service but this last time we went, our server was very attentive without being too much."}

{"text":"The jalapeño Margherita rocked.  Good?  Not do much.  Waiter tried to please us.  He was not cooking!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the Custumer service was awesome we had a guy I think his name was verny i think I'm not sure but he was really good everyone was really friendly !!! I would comeback"}
{"text":"This is the worst place for Mexican food or good service in the region. Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"The food is great, no honestly, it was terrific!
The tres leches cake was the first one I have ever had, and it was outstanding.
So why so few stars you ask?   
The service was as slow as molasses.  Our server was also a bit rude.  
We waited for over 35 minutes before our drink order was taken, oh and the bathrooms were terrible.  

Dinner was off to great start as we were seated in the beautiful patio area.  We were directly next to the relaxing water fountain and huge screen television, happily watching sports... After twenty minutes we began getting irritated and wondered if they had forgotten about us.  

I had to literally get the waiter to take our order, and then later on, we then needed to get up go and get him for our check.  Before we could go and get him, the manager came over to give us our check, and as if seeing the manager taking care of us, the waiter hurried over.  He then stood over us while we settled the check, and put money in the bill casing.  I am unsure if that is written somewhere or not, but you aren't supposed to stand over customers while they settle the bill and decide on a tip.  This made us very uncomfortable and is not something has ever been done to me before.  The servers usually give a moment of privacy while you settle the bill, but not here."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in the area. Love the guacamole and salsa. The rice and beans are tasty as well. The combos are priced well and the service has always been good. 

The tacos and enchiladas are yummy and the place is always busy."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed Mi Pueblo!  It was a nice change from my norm--Azteka.  It was authentic mexican with a modern flare.  The good thing is the prices remained pretty reasonable.  My glass of wine was $4..score!

The chips were fresh and crunchy, the salsa was semi- fresh but extremely hot.  

I had the california chicken burrito which was stuffed with mexican rice, GRILLED chicken (as opposed to the creepy shredded chicken) and black beans--it was very good.  It was smothered with queso and topped of with a cilantro- filled pico de gallo.  Excellent.

I didn't get to try their guacamole but will for sure try that next time.

The atmosphere was nice, large covered patio, great service, in and out....really, can't go wrong.  They have a lot of items that a traditional mexican restaurant would not have so it was a refreshing change.  

Muy bueno, me gusta, gracias, adios."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!

I am honestly not a fan of Mexican food. Give me a Taco Bell Quesadilla and I'm content but the boyfriend \"had to\" visit this place.

In a bubble, the food is good! The chips and dip are fresh and tasty. We added on the queso... it was average. My quesadilla with rice and beans were delicious and my boyfriend devoured his burrito with rice and beans.

Service was excellent and the food arrived quickly, even though the restaurant was packed. The price point was also very reasonable. A great addition to the area!"}
{"text":"Upon parking I was walking toward the door, and noticed a great smell from the restaurant, which made me very excited! I was seated upon arrival and offered chips & salsa and my drink order was taken, margaritas on the rocks were the drink special. While I reviewed the menu, I noticed a lot great menu options, but typically like to base my 1st visit to any Mexican restaurant on their fajitas. My waiter arrived to take my order and he indicated the dinner portion, typically available on Sundays, b/c their lunch specials are through Saturday, was very large. I asked if they could offer the lunch portion, and he immediately accommodating that question and said it will be $.99 more. I was fine with that. While I waited, I enjoyed the chips & salsa, which the salsa was great, b/c it had a nice kick, but the chips could have been a little better. The restaurant was not too crowded, but I loved the service & how clean and nice the restaurant was. My order was served on a steaming hot plate & I was very satisfied. The fajitas were served with onions, peppers, and tomatoes, and accompanied by rice, beans, lettuce, guacolmore & sour cream. Perfect portion, great service & and an enjoyable lunch experience.
If the chips were a little better, they could be 5 stars. I look forward to getting back :-)!"}
{"text":"Rude staff - we waited in the front while they argued over who would get the table. We ended with a younger lady whose listening skills really needed work. We had to repeat a lot of things. The order came out wrong. The food was okay- nothing great. Cheese dip was good but not better than any other Mexican place. Won't be visiting there ever again."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place two stars for the cold draft beer only! The food was horrible! My son couldn't even eat his rice it was dry and stale! I'll never visit this place again! Not to mention it was $35 for munch, with only one beer and two waters! Insane!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food (Kannapolis location). Excellent guacamole regional. I judge a good Mexican Restaurant by how good their salsa and guacamole is. If they do well with these 2 items the rest of the food will be good. Mi Pueblo does salsa and guacamole very well.

Atmosphere is very nice and clean.

My go to Mexican!! Well done."}
{"text":"I've only had the Jerk Chicken, one of their signature dishes and I can't bring myself to try anything else because its that good. The grilled veggies are always perfectly seasoned and fresh and their black beans are just stupid good. The chicken's always tender and juicy but the best part is the cloud of sour cream and pineapple goodness it sits on.  I need this dish right now aaaand it's 9am. They're not open yet. Suck!
They received 4 stars because service is on the slow side."}
{"text":"The inside of the restaurant is so beautiful and clean. (The outside patio with the waterfall was also nice but it was too cold to sit outside).  We were greeted warmly and seated as soon as we came in. The server was very nice and all of the cups and silverware were very clean. I ordered the lunch ACP  and my boyfriend had a lunch burrito, both of which were fantastic. The menu has a great selection of food, and there also is a ton of margaritas to try so when it gets warm I'll definitely be back for those lol. I'd definitely recommend everyone to stop by Mi Pueblo!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite local Mexican (Tex-Mex) restaurant in concord.  Unfortunately the menu has changed drastically and becomes me more focused on \"hipster\" items.  You can still find the traditional Tex-MEC items in the very back bottom of the menu.  I ordered some tamales and the corn breading was pre-made shells (?) and the pork filling was added when ordered.  Not tamales at all.---- Update---  the owner contacted me and apologize for my experience.  He thought the staff may have served me the wrong item for the tamales.  I commend him on his expeditious response.  I may give the restaurant another chance, being that it was one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Food was good and the price was right. 

Typical mexican fare, in a chain style restuarant, much better than Off the Border though. 

I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Decent food and decent service. Although the manager who brought our cheese dip out failed to realize we didn't have drinks nor chips. He said \"here's your cheese dip, enjoy\". I had to say, as he was walking off, could we get some chips please. They have a robust menu with a large selection of grilled items. The outdoor patio with waterfall wall is really relaxing. I would eat here again. Still searching for my hole-in-the-wall Mexican place in Matthews though."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough! The outdoor patio area makes you feel like you are at a private beach in the middle of the busiest street in Charlotte. The food comes in such large portions for lunch and dinner you'll definitely be taking some home. The prices are competitive with other Mexican restaurants in the area which is one less thing to worry about. Although the wait staff is very caring and kind and will do all they can to make sure you enjoy your meal - they are not the fastest- so be careful if you going on your lunch break. Other than that this is definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"My weakness is horchata. I get horchata every chance I see. This place has horchata.  It's not as rich as others I've drunk but still very good. The large selections in the menu is over whelming. However, everyone was satisfied and everything was delicious."}
