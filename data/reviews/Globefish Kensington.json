{"text":"When I die, I want to be mummified in a gigantic sushi roll from Globefish. Wrap me in that savoury seaweed paper and throw me into the ground. SO I CAN EAT MY WAY OUT! What? You thought I was just gonna die? Bitch please. I am gonna come back as the handsomest, most awesome zombie you ever laid your dumb eyes on. First, I am gonna eat my seaweed bodysuit and then I am going to move onto the entire city of Calgary. I am not going to stop until I eat the brains of every last one of you faux liberal hipsters. I might look timid but I am done with you chumps and anyways, I heard human brains taste like tuna roll and I fucking LOVE tuna rolls. Yummy yum yum."}
{"text":"Menu and quality are all right. Venue is great for a group of friends, cozy and comfy. Staff are not very friendly."}
{"text":"LOVE globe fish!! The funny thing is I was never really a sushi fan....up until my friend pushed me to try a little place called Globe Fish. She assured me that it would be amazing and I would love it..and that I HAD to try it. This was about a year ago....and now I am hooked.  Here is the BEST way to do it...  1) Begin with Beef Tataki (especially if you like tabasco) 2) Crimson River Roll 3) Pick a random speciality roll 4) Wild Salmon Sashimi 5) Edamame and possible another order of beef tataki  This is the Sara special....I am IN LOVE with all those items. I realize you can easily make edamame at home, however, the taste goes really well with the above mentioned items.  The only down side is GF is fairly expensive for a student...or anyone without millions...okay im exaggerating. But for special occassions, like my birthday which was recent, 2 trips is called for...and it is DEFINITELY worth it!!! Yummy, now I'm craving it!"}
{"text":"In the early days, I bemoaned the fact that work kept me on the far west end of downtown, in areas largely devoid of both plus-15's, and good restaurants in general.   When it's minus 30 out, or pouring rain, this can be highly distressing at lunch hour.   It's sometimes easy to forget, while embedded downtown, that Kensington really is only across the bridge. Because of that, lunch choices in the West end are, in fact, not dire.   Once I remembered that I could walk there, or better yet, take a short 5 minute drive from 6th ave to 14th street ( #becauseI'mlazy ), I became a Globefish regular.   The Kensington location is my favourite of the 3, though the hours are more restrictive than Chinook. Lunch being 11:30 - 3:00, Dinner 5:00 - 9:30. Nonetheless, those hours work for me.   Convenience is one thing, the quality of Globefish is another.   My several visits thus far have been more than satisfying.   The restaurant presents a nice atmosphere for dining with some privacy, as it sports several high-backed booths. Great for a lunch meeting or private conversation without eavesdroppers.   The menu is large, diverse, and creative. Plenty of selection ensures that each time you return, you are able to mix it up and try something new.   There are two ways I tend to go: the \"dressed up\" rolls and sashimi, with flavorful sauces that really engage... and sashimi platters so fresh, that drizzled hot sauces would only mask the quality of what's being served.   Globefish does both very well, which I appreciate. My common order is the \"Deluxe Sashimi,\" a nicely presented array on ice that looks as good as it tastes.   *** Side Note: I did upload a photo of my last Deluxe order for your viewing pleasure. However, I admit the posing shrimp MAY not have been delivered exactly like that... but hey, he looked like he was smiling, so deserved to be in the forefront! ****   The value of Globefish is the icing. I find the prices more than competitive. A bento box for lunch is one of the fairest deals around.   My only knock against Globefish is the parking situation. The lot fills up fast, so chances are you'll be parking elsewhere and walking. I always make sure to beat the lunch rush to prevent that from happening."}
{"text":"Tried a mixture of things from fresh oysters, prawn tempura, shrimp dumplings, sushi, sashimi, a few rolls and the bbq'd squid. The food was all very good with the exception of the bbq'd squid appetizer. I know squid can be chewy but this was like eating a rubber band. It actually snapped back and hit my 6 year old little nephew in the face. His response...\"Ewww, not good, not good!\" LOL. Everything else was very fresh and delicious.   The decor is very chic and beautiful. It seems like a great place to come for date night but might be a little on the pricey side.   Parking is a bit of a nightmare so make sure to arrive early or you may be driving around the block a few times. I do however think it's worth circling the block. :)  P.S. - Remember to proceed with caution when eating the bbq'd squid. :P"}
{"text":"Been to Globefish about 5 times. I think they have great sushi rolls. The service was great. The last time we went we tried the marinated squid appetizer - and it was delicious. Would definitely have that again. Was not overly impressed with the belly of tuna - it seemed to have chewy bits in it that I've never had before in that cut of fish (?) Overall the meal and service were good and I'd go back.   I remember when I first went there the decor and atmosphere seemed very upscale, but now it feels a bit tired and could use a polish."}
{"text":"We seem to go a lot here lately. Both for take out and dine in. The rolls are both a work of art and flavorful. We have found that we spend about the same or a little less than the all you can eat places, and always leave satisfied. Not overstuffed.    The only thing that irks me is that they do not take reservations for less than 6 people. So that leaves us out for the weekends, as the line can be long to get in.  You can also wait a long time for food if they are busy. But still always worth the wait."}
{"text":"Quality doesn't measure up to the cost. Seems to me they focus too much on inventing specialty rolls and they nelect the quality of it. They have some funny rolls, but just don't taste right. Rice in the rolls are kinda mushy, and they just stuff as much stuff in the rolls as they can and I can't really taste anything. The fusion idea is interesting but they aren't doing it well."}
{"text":"Meh.. The one in Marda Loop had much better Sashimi and Rolls, I'm not sure why? We were seated right away when we arrived just before 6, which was nice. Overall the dinner was alright. The dessert is not good so I don't know why everyone raves about it.   Not even worth the calories. I didn't even see cream puffs on the menu so maybe it was taken off? My mother got her soup much later than I got my orders and it was room temperature, which means it had been sitting for awhile. They should invest in either better or more servers. Overall it was just ok."}
{"text":"This is the standard for sushi in Calgary and they deliver, day in and day out.  I usually go with the standby bento box (Box C) which consists of miso soup, salad, edamame, 6 pieces of California Roll, 4 pieces of sashimi and 3 pieces of assorted sushi ( Shrimp, Tuna, Salmon) all  for a reasonable price of $11. I decided today to add a Spicy Fried Tuna Roll to my lunch which their standard tuna roll dusted with panko, deep fried and covered with their hot sauce.  This is SINFULLY good as the outside is crispy but the inside still has the consistency of regular sushi.  One word... Phenomenal.  I left absolutely stuffed.   Service is quick, we had a group of 17 and we were out of there in about an hour.  One of the best places to have lunch in Kensington and maybe even in Calgary.  A word of advice though, get there early to avoid a wait as seating is limited and ask for the green cap soy sauce.( sodium reduced)"}
{"text":"Globefish has definitely gone down hill in the last couple of years. I remember when it first opened and it was the best sushi in the city.   The past two times we have gotten take out the vegetarian rolls were falling apart and the rice was lacking if flavour and poor quality with a hit of sitting around too long.    Last time we got take out it was in styrofoam containers, which is pretty careless and unnecessary for a take out place these days especially as it is one of the only materials that is non-recyclable in  Calgary.   As a family who has been a patron of Globefish since the begging it is sad to say that we will be looking for a new favourite sushi place."}
{"text":"Didn't have anywhere to go the other night so I thought I would drop by Globefish on 14th.  I've been to Globefish a few times before and remembered it as being one of the better sushi and Japanese places in Calgary. I especially enjoyed the various Izakaya on the menu. Izakaya, in case you didn't know, are a cross between a bar and restaurant serving a variety of small plates and sake.   Sitting at the sushi bar, I ordered a glass of the Demon Killer sake which was smooth, light and complimented my meal quite nicely.  Now, a visit to an Izakaya is usually most fulfilling with a bunch of friends where bottles of sake and plates of food could be shared around the table. Being on my own and not wanting to expand my waistline anymore then I had from Christmas, I stuck to a modest amount of food.  A plate of Takoyaki, Favourite Sushi combo (Tuna, Salmon nigiri and California Rolls), and one each of Ebi, Hamachi and Wild Salmon made up my meal. While the sushi was good, it wasn't the best that I've had from Globefish. The rice was a little too moist and the California roll s were squished into a rectangular shape. Aesthetics is a huge part of Japanese food!  Again, I've had very good experiences at both Globefish locations in Calgary so while the food on this particular instance was not the best I've had, the restaurants still get 4-stars from me.  Check it out but go with some friends, order a bottle of sake and make an event out of it!  J"}
{"text":"My friend took me to lunch here while I was in Calgary for the summer, and while the sushi was good we felt it could've been a lot better for the price. I had The Wild Rose (salmon, tuna, avocado, and mango, topped with fresh cilantro, cream cheese, and black tobiko) and it was pretty yummyyy, but the other two rolls my friend ordered were nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"This would 5 stars if they took reservations. I was told they only do reservations for 8 or more.   Anyways, the Sushi is fantastic. If you go on weekdays, you rarely have to wait for a table. The seating at this location is better than the MardaLoop location and is less noisey. I like a little heat with my sushi, so I always order the God of fire rolls. The sushi chefs here know there stuff and I have never had a complaint about the quality or freshness."}
{"text":"If I had written this review 2 years ago, I would have given it 5 stars all the way. I'm giving it only two stars because they have truly become a victim of their own success. When we (husband and I)  used to come here (old, tiny location), it was packed, yes... but the sushi and side-dishes were extremely good. Sashimi was cut nicely, rolls were interesting and unique... the lineup was long but totally worth the wait.  The last time we ate here, our sashimi came out mangled. It's as if whoever prepared it was using a dull, serrated knife. I was extremely disappointed. Everyone was busy trying to get the dishes out on the tables instead of focusing on quality.   We noticed that more people eat rolls here. That's fine, but we are all about the sashimi and nigiri. We don't care for rolls unless I want to be stuffed full. We no longer eat at Globefish simply because it's too busy, parking is a nightmare, the prices are expensive for what you get, and there is more of a focus on fusion & rolls instead of sashimi and nigiri."}
{"text":"Fave sushi spot in Calgary!! Sometimes the service is off (rarely) but the food more than makes up for it. Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"muah!  thank you thank you thank you.  It has been a rough year moving from Vancouver where sushi is as common as air and great sushi is always just a few steps away.  Yes, I have found sushi in Calgary but the prices were horrifying and nothing compared taste wise, until Globefish.  My office is near and they have great lunch specials.  All the sashimi was fresh and all the various sushi we sampled was fresh.  I'm glad to have not given up on the Calgary sushi locales because I found my go to.    I see from other reviews dinner is busy but lunch was calm and service was attentive and quick.    I'll be back.  lol"}
{"text":"Just tried globe fish for the first time and I don't think I will ever go anywhere else for sushi it was absolutely amazing !!!"}
{"text":"I love the sushi and sushimi at Globe Fish! They're always the freshest and tastiest combinations of flavours. We tried the black rice instead of regular rice with our rolls and it was just as awesome. Great service and attentive servers. We will go back again."}
{"text":"Ultimate rolls and craft beers- smashingly good! I live in NYC area and eat here every time I'm in Calgary. The Alberta beef rolls are divine, and absolutely the best one is Cat's Eye. Superlative experience."}
{"text":"Parking's always a pain, but you'll have no problem if you head there before 6pm.  I've always had incredibly fast service with reasonably tasting sushi. Today was slow. We waited 30 mins before getting any of our sushi orders. Keeping in mind there were only 5-6 small tables occupied.  I love unagi, but their rolls barely had any. The flame combo is good bang for your buck with plenty of spice if you're into that. I'm always a fan of the green tea they serve. I liked that they featured a new Japanese beer (can't recall the name).   Slightly higher price for the quality of sushi you get. Great vibe."}
{"text":"This is a departure from the many Japanese restaurants in Canada that all have the same menu items.  Globefish has creative rolls and menu items. You can get tako yaki (delicious octopus dumplings) and mochi ice cream (a tiny scoop of ice cream wrapped in this stretchy, dough-like stuff made from rice).  Be prepared to wait! They don't take reservations and it's a very popular place.  Parking also iffy."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday night, noticed the euro-style interior, the waitress highlighted a dish on the front page of the menu, the \"Salmon Seattle\". Supposed to be slightly seared pieces of salmon. I ordered it and the \"Sashmi Roll\", which was salmon and tuna pieces in thin wrap. It was yummy, but the Salmon Seattle was drowned in thick sauce with some egg salad on top.. Not my \"cup of tea\".."}
{"text":"Globefish is a high-quality sushi restaurant, far far from the ocean.  I had the sashimi Omakase and everything was great, especially the hotate and toro which were melt-in-my-mouth amazing.  As Calgary's first Izakaya, they also have a deep sake selection.  This is my new go-to place in Calgary."}
{"text":"I am never eating sushi anywhere else in calgary but here! The BEST SUSHI I think in town. The Kinsignton location offers you the whole deal: service, quality sushi, great prices, amazing atmosphere, .. All of it for the hell of the good experience and repeat business! Well, I AM SOLD! This is my new fav spot in Town."}
{"text":"Perfect every time, and I don't say that very often. Usually no matter how good a restaurant is there is bound to be a visit that makes you not want to come back. Not globe fish. I been coming here for a couple of years now on and off since I don't live in Calgary but no matter when I go or how often I go IT'S STILL SO DAMN GOOD.   The sashimi is what I come to globe fish for. The quality of the sashimi is outstanding and always fresh. Their special rolls are always tasty and very creative  If your into fresh oysters, then this place is a must.   I never had a really big problem with the service yet, they are a little slow sometimes and can forget about minor orders."}
{"text":"To be fair, I really like the black rice option for maki... but... I think that's the only reason I'd decide to go to a Globefish chain sushi restaurant as opposed to anywhere else... otherwise ... pretty darn generic.  No surprises... good or bad.  The Toyota Corolla of sushi restaurants.  Meh ..."}
{"text":"Finally tried Globefish - heard so many mixed things that I always ended up at my reliable and much beloved Wa's. We didn't try any sushi - but sampled ebi mayo, calamari and tuna tacos. The ebi mayo is one of the best I've sampled - plump and fresh prawns - not overbattered and good crunch - drizzled lightly with sauce and sprinkled with roe. The calamari was really rich - not complaining but you can only have a few bites and the portion size is generous. Finally - the tuna tacos were delicious - fresh tasting, clean, stuffed full chopped tuna, avocado and slice of tomato. I would have preferred it without vegetables as it didn't really add anything and detracted from tuna, but you can just toss it off. No biggie.  Not in same league as Sushi Club, but not a bad spot."}
{"text":"For now, a very quick honest review.  This is,  so far from about 5 other top Sushi Restaurants I've been to... in Calgary-this is the top, the best, the most delicious, amazing crazy addictive sushi.  From the entrees to the main meal to the desserts.. I loved it so much, we have decided its our only - go to.  The food is sent from heaven... to their kitchens... then given to us.  Some people complain of a long wait to get your food, perhaps that is the reason why. It's made in Sushi heaven- it really is worth the wait if its a bit slow.  I (we) are not going to this restaurant to rush in and rush out. Its a date night, so we enjoy the time between the courses to talk and laugh- and when the food comes we are happy and enjoy it.... No question,  it is  the best Sushi, in the top two- between Montreal and Calgary!!"}
{"text":"Love love love Globefish! One of my fave restaurants in Calgary. I've been to all 3 locations. I think the best is the Kensington location, followed by Chinook and Marda Loop in a close 3rd. The only downside is they need to start taking reservations."}
{"text":"I was super impressed with this sushi spot!     I had 5 in my party and had made a reservation at another sushi restaurant around the corner.  They fit us in, but when arrived told us we had to be out by 7, (which was an hour and a half), AND they just pulled a chair up to the end of an already small table for 4...not impressed.  I left and started walking the neighbourhood and that's how I found Globefish.  First of all, there were no limits on how long I could stay...hahaha. (you get one star for that...)  We started by sharing a few humongous ice cold Sapporo's.  The appy's and a nonstop flow of fish!  Everything we ate, (and it was a lot), was awesome here!  Extremely fresh, plus our waitress let us know of the stuff just flown in this morning as a special, one of these items was mackerel.  Mackerel is not your typical sushi bar fish, it's much more oily and fishy tasting.  They brought it to the table, gave it a quick shot of flame and it tasted fantastic!  Definitely a place I will return when travelling to Calgary."}
{"text":"Note: I was in the hospitality and service industry for over 10 years and I even served in a number of Japanese restaurants, so I'm extremely picky on which restaurants I go to. I only return to restaurants who provide great service and great quality. Service and Quality are always a number one priority, and everything else is a bonus!   So when I give a good review, it means I'm truly impressed.   I've been going to the Kensington Globefish for over 6 years. The Chinook location is my second favorite.   The food and the sushi are always spot on. The GM (Amane) and his service team are always amazing, and they always go above and beyond. When me and my fiance go to Globefish, they treat us like family.   No, it's not an all-you-can eat restaurant, but your paying for quality. I would much rather have delicious tasting sushi, over a mass consumption of cheap sushi.   I love their seared beef tataki, seaweed salad, ebi sunomono salad, rolls(aka maki), and their salmon sashimi is so yummy.   I love their chic decor, and the restaurant and restrooms are very clean.   I love Globefish because the product has stayed very consistent since I first discovered them. I always bring our out of town guests here, and we often have our big milestones celebrations here. This is where I met my fiance' for our first date!  Great first date location! This place holds so many great memories for me and my fiance'.  Globefish is very special to  us!"}
{"text":"Other than moved from table to table. The sashimi was very fresh. The agadashi tofu was plentiful and cooked to perfection. Globefish served the largest salmon rolls I have ever had. They were awesome. We had the Rapture role and the God of fire rolls...all I can say is .......Wow. They were very hot an freaking amazing. The prices seem expensive until you get your food, you get a LOT!! This place rocks. I would come again for sure!!"}
{"text":"Considering that sushi in Calgary doesn't compare to Vancouver and other seaports, Globefish is one of the few places I will eat in Calgary. They don't always have fresh uni (sea urchin) but when they do, it's fresh. Also, they have brown rice sushi, which my wife loves for any sushi rolls. Their vegetable tempura is one of the best I've ever had - incredibly light and use of quality vegetables. Love their special rolls and special selection of salmon (not just Atlantic -farm salmon) - they bring in king salmon, and sockeye (which by the way is way more common in Vancouver).  Friendly staff, get their early for weekday lunch - it fills quickly - one of the negatives behind living in a city with few quality sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"I am underwhelmed by Globefish. It's not that I would say the sushi and food are bad, it's that I've had much better quality sushi for far less (I will be continuing to visit Li-Ao for my sushi fixes). The service was good, our waitress was very attentive, and we appreciated the atmosphere, but the quality for the price just didn't strike a chord for either me or my SO. Additionally, waiting for a table is a huge pain, and Globefish, overall, while tasty, isn't worth waiting long periods of time for."}
{"text":"I don't like writing negative reviews but here it goes. We wanted to try a sushi place in Kensington but they didn't let us in since we didn't have a reservation. So we ended up here.   The place is big and decent looking. They have a big screen and it was showing Japanese dance which was probably the only good thing about this place. Too bad the screen was behind me!  What I really hate is half the people getting their food and the other half having to wait another 10 minutes to get theirs. It pisses me off more than anything. When you're out with a group you want to enjoy the activity together.  After a long wait, I get my brown rice combo or whatever that thing was! It was cucumber wrapped in brown rice and maybe trace amounts of fish here and there! The miso soup was too salty."}
{"text":"An array of tasty rolls to choose from. Everything is fresh and the decor is friendly. One of the more expensive sushi places so it's more a place to go for a special day. The special rolls are all worth every penny and more. There are three locations to choose from and for the most part they are all tasty and reliable. The service is can be slow at times but well worth the wait. The sashimi is very fresh and good cuts."}
{"text":"It is very hard to find a good quality sushi restaurant here in Calgary.  When I discovered Globefish a few years ago, I was super excited that I have finally found my go-to sushi restaurant in town.     Now fast forward to present day...I am not sure what happened, but the quality of the food have gone down hill (new chef maybe?).  I am back on the hunt for my new favourite sushi restaurant =("}
{"text":"I still feel that Globe Fish is one of the best sushi spots in Calgary. For the price, you definitely cannot beat it. They have great quality fish and friendly staff. The place is a little small so don't try to go there at peak times or you might have to wait a bit. They don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last week, the sushi was quite good if not a little more expensive then our usual places (Sushi Zeal &amp; Sakana Grill).  Their rolls however are very tasty and super creative a must try if you attend.  The only complaint was the seating isn't very good for larger groups, we went with 6 people and waited over an hour due to there only being a couple tables that can take more then 4.  Trying the Mardaloop location that takes reservations is probably a good idea."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my sister after a little tennis hitting session.  The place has a very chill/relaxed vibe with tables near the windows and high white booths further in the restaurant.  We got there just before the dinner rush! Thank goodness because the lineup was insane when we ordered and was still just as big when we left.  Anyways, for the food, we ordered three appetizers and two sushi rolls.  For appetizers, we shared the: - Spicy agedashi tofu ($6) - great house sauce to accompany the deep fried dofu.  There were 6 decent pieces of tofu for us to split equally. Nice. - Seaweed salad ($5) - nice crunch to to the seaweed and - Rock'n shrimp ($9) - popcorn shrimp with a nice cream sauce.  Not too creamy though. Just the right amount.  Shrimp battered lightly but still nice crunch to it.  For sushi, we had these two rolls that came with 6 pieces each: - Red ocean ($10) - spicy tuna, cucumber and horseradish with topped with a nice piece of wild salmon on top.   - Tsunami salmon roll ($9) - I really liked this one, reminded me of vietnamese fresh spring rolls.  Avocado, salmon and mango wrapped in cilantro and rice paper.    Total was $44 after taxes.  We were stuffed silly so had to take a small box of rolls for home.  Definitely worth checking out.  Although get there early!!"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 for overall ambience, decor, service and parking lol.  Going to have to really appreciate this for Calgary, no free side street parking unless you're willing to walk 10 min.  My 1st izakaya experience, and much different from Vancouver: no ebi mayo as appetizers, and too much sushi roll selection, depending on one's view of izakaya.  The Van ones either have no rolls or very few: GS seems to be the jackhammer of all trades here lol but the effort's there.  Ordered the gyozas, a staple, and while good, not worth ordering again.  Nice round seating booths, fancy lighting, a really good polished look here for lounge reasons.  It's definitely date-worthy and a place to take out of town guests."}
{"text":"This place is always packed...and for good reason. Their sushi is soooo yummy! The price is quite expensive for such small portions but I guess it allows you to try more things on the menu, that is if you don't mind paying for it. I don't like that you have to pay for pop refills tho...like come on, you guys charge an arm & a leg for the food & you're making tonnes of money from the crazy business you get & you can't spare a few cents on a pop refill? Weak! But other than that, the servers (tho hard to understand most times) are friendly & the food comes out really fast & fresh. One word describes it all: YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"I work close to here and come often, as the meso soup is free during lunch.  They have specialty rolls and prices that you cannot get anywhere else.  Food is always fresh and fast."}
{"text":"We have tried Many different sushi places in Alberta, and Globefish Kensington is still  my favorite. (see how many check-ins I have here!) Comparing the quality, with the price and you will become a regular here too! I would recommend almost all their rolls, Salmon Sashimi and even ice cream desserts! You can also order take away on the phone and go pick it up.  The service has always been good and the staff are friendly. you owe it to yourself to try it at least once!"}
{"text":"Food is still great, but wait times are seriously bad. Also got a parking ticket for being on one of the end stalls that is designated for Color Me, the pottery place next door. Don't do it! Don't park there! Even when they are closed. =("}
{"text":"Num num num! Such good food and fast service."}
{"text":"Over priced yuppy/hipster sushi restaurant.  Quality is decent, prices are high. Service is o.k. Decor is ??? I kinda felt like I was stepping into an Ikea catalogue.  The Sushi is typical \"Canadian-ized\" crap slathered in sauces and bullshit. Too many ingredients spoil the dishes here. Nigiri is expensive and not authentic. They do not properly season their rice, and there is no wasabi between the fish and the rice. Also rice:fish ratio is WAY off. Too little rice for the slice of fish.  Definitely DON'T GO HERE If you are looking for authentic Japanese Sushi. Miso soup tasted bland and was probably freeze-dried package with boiled water added. No depth to the broth. (apparently they have never heard of dashi)  Won't be back if I can help it."}
{"text":"The environment and the staff are good but it's not a Japanese food! It's a Canadian version Japanese food! We celebrated our friend's birthday there but they even charged us a \"cake fee\"!"}
{"text":"Pork gyoza: good, quite fresh and hot, but nothing special. King Salmon Wrap: salmon wrapped around arugula with jalapeño and roe on top. Quite good, and unique, though overpriced.  Rising Sun: tuna, asparagus, wrapped with toasted coconut on the outside. Delicious! The tuna must have been smoked, and the toasted coconut was the perfect compliment! You could eat this without soy/wasabi an be very happy, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Rolls are delicious! Sashimi quality is great but size is very small. Price is expensive. Decor is lovely."}
{"text":"I was never a sushi fan before coming here. I have been twice now and quite like it. Prices are high for sushi for sure and yakisoba portions will probably leave you hungry after if you happen to have that compared anywhere else. Excellent service and nice environment. There seems to be just enough parking."}
{"text":"Their \"fusion\" dishes are not bad but the sushi isn't very good any more.  The last time we ordered sashimi and nigiri here it looked like it was cut with a hacksaw and there were bones in it still.  We know the fish is fresh but it's poorly prepared.  It's a shame, really because they used to be great.  They're a victims of their own success.  If you come during dinner they're so busy they can't handle the crowd.  The food suffers because of it.  It was much better when they had limited seating and could serve quality food.  They used to be my favorite place in the city for sushi but not any more."}
{"text":"The Kensington location is very possibly the best sushi spot in Calgary. The decor is urbane; the atmosphere pan-Euro-Asian - albeit a little sterile of true Kyoto-ness.    If you like maki, you're in luck, it is clearly the house specialty.  The selection of maki rolls here rivals the best Japanese restaurants in Vancouver.  Portion sizes are, unusually for a sushi restaurant, quite large - if you order your maki a la carte, you will find that one to two orders will fill even the most corpulent sushi connoisseur.  Special mention here for the Flames Roll Combo, despite the association the name conjures to that mediocre hockey team that plays out of the home arena.  I never miss an opportunity to meet a client for lunch at Globefish, and neither should you."}
{"text":"great for lunch specials!   went here for lunch about a week a go. the service was a little slow but the price was great and the food quality was amazing! very fresh and very tasty! they were very busy so i see why the service was slow.BUT it was well worth the wait! we will be going back again!"}
{"text":"Yum. What it comes down to is that Calgary's sushi scene has become bigger and all-you-can-eat is exploding in way that appears to be influencing other restaurant chains into some sort of lower standard. Smaller portions cut poorly and service you can even acknowledge as \"service\". Globefish has the opposite approach. The staff smile. The menu is not huge but it allows for sufficient variety. The food is fresh and tasty and the plating is impeccable. They even understand \"gluten free\" - it isn't something they had even to \"deal with\" rather it is something they have embraced recognizing it is part of today's norm. Thank you Globefish. They accommodated our bigger table with professional courtesy and efficiency. Nothing and no one was overlooked."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi restaurant with amazing service! I really enjoy any and all different kinds of sushi and sashimi at Globefish, and they're green tea ice cream for dessert is one of my most favourite desserts! Great place to go for any occasion."}
{"text":"Okay, I'll put this out there first before I go any further: I do not like sushi.  And I've tried it enough times to say that proudly.  It's just not for me.  That being said, I've been to sushi restaurants with my friends and other sushi lovers.  I usually get something that's been cooked, if I'm lucky enough to find it.  Globe fish actually has a nice selection of foods other than sushi, which makes me very happy!  I like that they offer an assortment of tempura as well as different noodle dishes and salads.  They do have a whole bunch of sushi and rolls though.  It's a good thing I don't like it or I would be here for hours trying to decided which kind to order.  Some actually sound pretty good, like the Avocado Roll: fresh avocado rolled with rice ans seaweed.  That should be okay for me, right?  Wrong.  I've tried it... don't like it.  I don't mind going to Globe Fish since they do have something besides sushi that I can eat.  I also really enjoy the appearance of the inside.  It's somewhat modern and chic and makes me feel kind of fancy when I'm in here.  So, if you like sushi (or even if you don't) Globe Fish actually makes for a pretty good time.  Eat up, my friends!"}
{"text":"A place for fresh and moist sushi... the moisture must come from the mayonnaise that they put in the rolls because they taste a little salty.  I liked the serving size of their dishes.  Their tempura wasn't that great.  It's nice that they have brown rice sushi available too but they didn't have them when I was there at lunch."}
{"text":"Pretty fresh sushi.  The rolls are really great.  They have lots of different rolls.   Seems like the Flames frequent here a lot 'cos a lot of the rolls are named after the Flames.    I had the udon and tempura lunch special.    It was tasty and the tempura was piping hot!    It's a little pricey but sometimes you've got to pay for freshness.  Give it a try at Globe Fish!"}
