{"text":"There have been a few establishments that have come and gone from this location, so when it reopened as Smokehouse, we decided to check it out for brunch.  A smokey fire pit welcomes you at the entrance before you emerge into a bright and open rustic dining hall.   The menu seemed promising, I went with the brisket benny which was served on a bed of cornbread, and topped with chipotle tomato jam and hollandaise and a side of hashbrowns. The cornbread had a perfect crunch to it, and the brisket was tender and flavourful. As much as I love hash browns, some fruits or tomatoes would have helped cut down the richness of the entire dish.  They are fairly new, I think I'll give them time to get settled and then give their dinner menu a try."}
{"text":"My husband and I have just returned from a wonderful meal, with his parents, at the smokehouse. We were able to make a reservation for an early dinner through the OpenTable app.   On arrival we found the restaurant to be very quiet and we were greeted right away by our server. It sounds like they have recently made some menu changes and our server communicated the few options that were not available.   They have quite a selection of beers on tap and our drinks came right away after we ordered.  For food, we ordered the brisket sandwich, a couple of burgers -& the soup + grilled cheese. While we waited for our entrees, we were given complimentary warm corn bread and it was delicious.   Our entrees were out within 15-20 minutes, all fresh and extremely tasty. We all pretty well cleared our plates.  The dessert selection was plentiful and we decided to order the Chocolate Moose S'more as well as the Jack Daniels Blondie brownie. Both were so delicious it's hard to say which we enjoyed more. The hubby and I live close by and have already said we will walk down here again on a summers evening just for dessert!   In all seriousness we had an excellent dining experience. The restaurant is quaint, rustic, with a lovely country ambiance. Prices are competitive for similar places. We will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Have eaten here both dinner and brunch.  Brunch was okay,  service was very poor and would not recommend going for brunch there are better places.  Dinner was good and their signature meat boards are delicious and huge.  I really enjoyed the brisket and my sister had the pulled pork and both were fantastic.  Service was much better at dinner."}
{"text":"Great lunch. Had the Brisket Dip. The server was great, always had a smile on her face, even when I tried to give her a hard time as I am want to do.  She saw right through me. Watch out Sala.  Cornbread was excellent. Will be back."}
{"text":"The cornbread which they bring to you is FANTASTIC!   The portions on the boards are large and seem like a great value for the YYC market.  It's not loud like the chains so you can actually have a conversation without yelling and the smoked Ceasars have AMAZING flavour.   The presentation is artistic for a smokehouse - meat presented on a rustic board.    I will go back and try more on the menu soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I want so very badly for a restaurant to succeed at this very hard-to-succeed-at location.   Unfortunately, the Symons Valley Roadhouse quickly went from great to awful, and then Django Smokehouse lasted for, seemingly, 10 minutes.   This latest tenant, we doubt, will do any better than their predecessors based on our experience there.   I'll start with my wife's meal, as that was kinda the highlight of the night. She ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup. It was nice, but $19 nice? Not sure about that. The soup was thick and gritty, but despite how unappealing that may read, it was actually quite good. The grilled cheese (four kinds of cheese) was what you would expect - ooey, gooey. It's pretty hard to mess that up.   That, unfortunately, is the end of a very short 'Pros' list.   To drink, instead of ordering the regular caesar, she chose the 'Smokehouse Caesar' which was to be joined by a tomato garnish, pickle, cheese and a pepperoni stick. Well, the tomato garnish never made an appearance, and the pepperoni stick consisted of an inch-long piece cut from the ass end of a plain old pepperoni stick you'd buy at a gas station. The cheese was, well, a dice-sized cube of marble cheese. Tragically underwhelming considering they charge $10 for it.   We ordered the arancini as an appetizer, but were told they were out. We settled on the corn fritters, and finished them off. We prefer them a little more crispier than what we got. They came across as a bit underdone and similar in texture to that of a fried chicken ball you'd get from a Chinese restaurant, if that makes any sense?? The dipping sauce made up for it, though.   Note: They should think of serving that sauce with the cornbread they bring out, as well, as it can get a little dry on its own.   I ordered the Classic Platter, which is one meat accompanied by two sides for $21. Now, considering Big Sky BBQ in Okotoks does a platter with three different meats and one side for a dollar cheaper, I was skeptical, but thought it just meant I was going to get a lot of my meat of choice - brisket - to go with my sides of mac and cheese and a hasselback potato.   What I received was, and I really am not trying to be mean, but the most unappealing and inedible brisket I have ever had. Two and a half big slices that were pure fat. It was gross to cut away all the fat and try eat what remained. Despite my best attempts to avoid it, I still ate a ton of fat whose greasy and distinct taste remained in my mouth for the remainder of my evening.  It came with my bbq sauce of choice (no sauces to choose from at the table). I chose honey garlic, and what they gave me was barely a tablespoon of the best sauce Kraft has to offer. Very disappointing, as my attempts to cover up the brisket ended after a few tries due to the sauce running out.   The mac and cheese was passable. I have had better. I have had worse.   Now, if done right, the hasselback potato can steal the show. That was not the case at this establishment on this occasion. What I was served was a potato maybe slightly bigger than a Cadbury Easter Egg that was horribly overcooked, and then covered with a dollop of sour cream. Oddly enough, I received more sour cream than I did bbq sauce.   We wanted to like this place. We live nearby, and would love to have solid go-to restaurant to call our own. Our waitress was great, and the rest of the staff looked eager to make things run smoothly.   However, a really tough location and the quality of food we received (if is it any indicator) will make it tough for them to succeed where their predecessors failed.   We won't be back again."}
