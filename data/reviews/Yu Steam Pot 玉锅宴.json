{"text":"Food: really good! The seafood was really fresh and they steamed it perfectly. I liked the little sauce station where you could create your own dipping sauce from soy sauce, garlic, chilli peppers, etc. We got the 4 person combo for $218 and we were so full by the end of it! Also loved the congee, it's really smart to have it cook under the seafood throughout the meal because then it soaks up all the flavours. 

Service: Never had to wait for long to get a server's attention and they were all really friendly! 

Interior: Pretty white marble tables, lots of private rooms for special events and karaoke"}
{"text":"Had the $32 per person combo (only applicable to table of 6 or more) Quite filling ! 

Food was healthy because it was steamed. The food isn't premartinated so you only have the sauce provided to dip your food in. 

Dessert was the only disappointing course. It was just diluted marinated mango jello. 

If you get a room, you get free karaoke for the night. Can be quite loud though! You'll experience lots of drunk people in the other room, predominantly Mandarin songs. 

A bottle tsing Tao beer is about 5 bucks. Good deal if you wanna add drinks. 

Service was excellent! Would come here again but for dinner and karaoke. 

For price and food about 3 stars. Because it's also free karaoke we would give it 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I didn't know of how popular steaming your food was until I came here.
Adjoining to the bowling alley this place is huge, with private rooms that have karaoke available to its clientele. 
The ambiance is really fancy in the private rooms, but outside it's nonetheless nice and contemporary. 
Overall their prices are a bit high, combos vary depending on the party size and can start anywhere from $80+ to well over $300. 
Since this place is known for its steamed food we took 2 combos of 2 can dine for $88 for our party of 6 and ordered a few side dishes.
The combo consist of various raw dishes on a steamer tray containing holes whereby once steamed, the juices from the tray would drip to the bottom of the pitted pot in the center of the table.  Over time, with many other dishes being steamed, the juices created a versatile broth for the congee which was the final dish of the combo.  Prior to the congee we had the opportunity to try steamed fish, steaks, marinated chicken, veggies, lobster, etc.

Overall the experience, quality, customer service and food was great! however I still find this place a bit pricey and at times overrated."}
{"text":"This place is very nice!!! 
Interior is clean and well decorated. 

Not a cheap place. Combo for 2 starts at 88$ before tax and tips. 

Everything is steam, so it's great for health nut. In the beginning of the meal, they put rice and veggies under the steamer.  All the juice from the meats and seafood will drip down into the rice and in the end, u get a really rich tasting congee!  

The presentation of the food is amazing as well

Aside from the price. I love everything."}
{"text":"Was looking for something more healthy to eat and thought we'd give this place a try. It was pretty late at night- around 10:30pm so the place was empty. Not sure how busy they are during dinner time. 

Ordered the 2 person tasting menu which comes with a side dish of crispy tofu cubes and salt and pepper dry ribs. Let me just say I'm very impressed. All the food was really tasty! A refreshing change from your usual meal out. Light, fresh, and savoury. Our server was very attentive and friendly.

The restaurant is very large so it can accommodate big groups. We asked to take a look at the karaoke rooms after our meal. There are 8 in total with the biggest one containing 2 large tables which can accommodate up to 40 people. I would definitely book one of the private rooms for a group of 6 or more in the future. There is no extra charge. 
The entrance is inside the World Bowl can complex.  I would definitely come here again and recommend."}
{"text":"It was our first time trying steam hotpot and our family really enjoyed it! Food was great and so was the service. It is a fairly large restaurant. Previously the location was a karaoke, so if you book a private room then you can sing and eat. Private rooms only have combination meals while in the main dining you can order a la cart. Our 6 people combo included: clams, steamed scallops with vermicelli, pork neck, spicy pork, lobster, Vancouver crab, abalone (usually rib eye steak), free range chicken, vegetables, and dumpings. Great place for a group dinner so you can try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I came with a group of 6 people and we booked a private room - with Karaoke! This is very nice since we can talk and laugh freely and the nice thing is, there's no extra charge for it! We ordered the 6 people combo:
Seafood was quite fresh and tasty. The fact that they steam it in front of you, all the dishes we had are fresh and hot!! On the flip side, my friends and I are not a big fans of their cooked dishes, especially the beef...too much cumin. We wish we can substitute it with something else or simply just pan fried beef with garlic. The service was very good! Our server's name is Linda, she is very friendly and helpful. Overall, I enjoyed the experience and will come again :)

Oh - forgot to mention - our total bill came up to $365 ($61pp) all in."}
{"text":"Just had a very good meal here last night. It's like seafood hot pot, except you don't cook your own food - it's steamed instead of boiled in broth. Each course is actually cooked for you by one of the servers, who uses a timer on the table to make sure everything is cooked just right. They put washed rice with a few papaya chunks into the steam basin so that the essence of the seafood drips back into it and at the end, it becomes seafood-flavoured rice porridge (aka congee).

We ordered the 4 person meal even though we were a group of 6 (per their advice) because my grandparents eat very little these days, and then we added a couple items. Each course came beautifully arranged onto the steaming rack and though they didn't take long to cook, this is definitely more of a leisurely type of meal, for enjoying with good company because you're not just going to pop in and pop out.

Our set meal had a wonderful variety of food:
*two cold appetizers - marinated fried tofu (delicious), and some kind of noodle sheets (not a fan - too thick, plus my family doesn't typically have that)
*pork collar, squid, some kind of clam, and enoki mushrooms
*steamed fish!!!
*clams (one of mine had sand in it but other than that, they were delicious)
*oysters - your choice of garlic or house-made soybean paste (my family chose the latter; it was delicious, even though normally I would've preferred garlic)
*lobster (delicious!)
*steamed chicken (marinated, steamed over a lotus leaf) with vegetables
*beef tenderloin with vegetables (overdone for me personally, but very juicy and tender)
*dungeness crab (AMAZINGLY sweet and fresh)
*fresh-made dumplings (delicious - great quality wrappers)
*seafood congee (so good - but I couldn't taste it until I cleansed my palate with some tea first)
*they also gave us mango pudding as dessert, which I think was on the house because they were being so nice

Everything was super fresh and high quality - very delicious. They have a small sauce bar where you can choose your ow dipping sauces but honestly, I felt that a lot of the food didn't need any enhancement at all.

I loved watching everything cook through the glass lids, and it was a very fun experience because every course was unveiled in front of me like a gift. It was delight after delight, for like 10 courses.

The service was also exceptional. The ladies who served us were all super nice. They even noticed that we didn't eat the noodle sheets and asked for feedback, and then threw in extra dessert for us knowing we didn't enjoy the noodle sheets. And they were also great when we asked them to take a photo for us, suggesting which angles would block out any other people in the shot, etc.

Overall it was a great experience and I look forward to returning!"}
