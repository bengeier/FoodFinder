{"text":"Zteca is a chain in Toronto and I am not a fan. I've been to this particular location two or three times, and another location on King two or three times. In each case, I've found the food much blander than I expect from Mexican food.  The flavours that are present seem washed out. You can't even really taste the rice. The textures are fine, it's just generally lacking in the flavours of the main ingredients themselves but also spices.  This may be because I haven't had any meat-based dishes. It's possible that all of the taste in Zteca is locked into the meat, but their vegetarian dishes (salad, burrito and rice bowl) are all quite bland.  I can recommend Zteca only if you've never had Mexican food before and want to take the smallest of steps into the unknown. Zteca is the blandest Mexican food I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Food is alright, and price is average (per food prices downtown). This is a food court location, hence not much can be said about the venue.  Food wise, it is okay? Nothing super wow-ing. I will likely come back to try other food items they offer. Flavour is just okay, but I am glad it is not over powering cause I can add more flavours later.   Staff wise is good, they are on the ball and moved hastily to keep the line going."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend and decided to get Zteca since Thai Express was packed. Got their Grill Steak Burrito with chips & drink. the burrito didn't have much flavour. The rice & wrap were plain and there wasn't enough steak. The chips were really salty, so I end up throwing the entire bag after eating a couple. Prefer going to Quesada or Burrito Boys instead."}
{"text":"Not worth the $10 I paid for the salad bowl. Not much food other than lettuce and didn't taste that great."}
{"text":"Pretty small portions, for lunch rush the rice tastes pretty stale, and not very flavourful. Does not compete with Chipotle, freshwest, or even taco del mar, which is saying A LOT.  I wish I worked closer to Bolets!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Zteca many times, since there are only a few food options in the Southcore Financial Centre food court. There is usually a large lineup and it's often one of the slowest, but you can order your food using Grabb. I usually order a burrito bowl and alternate between their protein options. Cod and beef barbacoa are my favorites. Guacamole is an additional cost. I find that the food is very filling at a reasonable price. There used to be an employee there that greeted you in Spanish as he took your order, but sadly I haven't seen him there in a while."}
{"text":"This Mexican burrito place is a franchise and has many locations in and around the city. This location is new as it is located within the office building in a food court on the 2nd floor. The service was great and they were very attentive. We ordered one chicken quesadilla and one steak rice bowl. Both were very good. They are fairly generous with the toppings although guacamole is extra. The food court atmosphere is quite nice. Lots of seating and natural lighting. The fast food chain loses one star because their prices are a bit higher than what I think is reasonably priced for a burrito place. However I would grab a bite here again."}
