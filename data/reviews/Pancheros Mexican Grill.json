{"text":"Very good customer service. The staff always acts like they are happy you are there. Food is good given the price point.  This is a place that will get my repeat business."}
{"text":"Average to poor for quality and taste. 


We stopped by with hopes of having of a Chipotle-like experience. Despite a carbon copy approach to food, this place was uninspiring bland. There were too many uncharges for basic items such as fajita veggie. The food was not seasoned and my bowl was simply pitiful. They get a couple of points for cleanliness and service. Too bad the food left our entire party of 6 disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was kind of slow. Food was alright not a huge fan. They don't give even porportions of condiments. I would prefer chipotle."}
{"text":"Really less quantity and totally dis-interested service .. Wasted my money here today .."}
{"text":"I got a burrito bowl, and it was actually really fresh and tasty. Maybe the cilantro lime sauce? I thought it was expensive for what it was though -- a small (very small) bowl of basically vegetables for $7. 

Now that I'm writing this, it probably deserves 3 stars (fast service)... but it's 99% the same as Qdoba, but on the other side of University. Just doesn't stand out."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff and food. Mario, Ruben and Edna have been great to me and Dustin with their superior customer service. We eat there at least once week because of the great service."}
{"text":"This was a very unfortunate combination of incredibly bland and/or burnt food, and completely uninterested, apathetic, and lethargic staff. 
It's the situation where you see someone prepare food and you sincerely hope it's not yours. And then it is."}
{"text":"Lately the food here has been overcooked and the tortillas have been under cooked.  It used to be a lot better, but there is an ever-changing staff coming through.  Fast service is a plus."}
{"text":"Tasted like rubbish topped with stale/cold queso. Do yourself a favor and get Taco Bell if you are spending cheap or wait in line at Chipotle for a true burrito. This is my second trip here and the cookin' ain't for any set of tastebuds."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the big burrito, but I'm also a fan of a freshly cooked tortilla and having the innards mixed up too.  This place has the trifecta.

Some outdoor seating along with a beautiful Phoenix afternoon made this a good break from work."}
{"text":"I finally made it here! After my lab mates repeatedly told me Panchero's has the best burritos in town, even above Chipotle. Prior to going I have searched the internet for their menu and such, they said every tortilla is freshly pressed, by that, I assumed they just warm it up for you, just like how other burrito places do it. 

Boy were we in for a treat. We saw how they grab the dough and placed in onto the presser, and in one blink of my eye (quite literally), we have a freshly pressed tortilla skin! Next the waiter warmed it up on the hot plate, before assembling ingredients of your choice. Just before wrapping up the burrito he mixed the fillings up for you, so every bite feels even. 

I love the smell and taste of the freshly pressed tortilla, so much so that we actually ordered a couple of the tortillas, yes, just the tortillas, to go. What is different for Panchero's is that their burritos are similarly priced regardless of the choice of meats. I have to say though the remainder of the dinner wasn't as exciting as the tortillas.

As previous reviews pointed out their meats are less flavorful. That is something within acceptable level for me. I am not a huge fan of heavily flavored foods. However, their rice isn't something I will get used to easily. Instead of the cilantro-lime rice I so love, their rice tasted pretty salty. It reminded me of the side of rice I got at Popeye's. 

I can foresee myself going back, their tortillas are that good. But I will stay away from the rice this time."}
{"text":"This place is a serious joke, the portion size for the price is rediculas they have portion scoopers that are tiny little itty bitty spoons. I would have to eat at least 4 of these tiny burritos to get full. This will be the last time that I ever go here. They need to close this place down. Chipotle is defiantly the place to go not here.. Save your money and time"}
{"text":"for a fast food burrito this place kicks butt over chipotle. the steak is incredible and cooked before your eyes (along with the tortilla). i love how they mix all of the ingredients together before they wrap the burrito. plus, the kids working inside are always really nice. take a day off from chipotle college brats and give it a try...its a freaking burrito, how could you not like it?"}
{"text":"I'm giving Panchero's a 4 out of 5 because I'm comparing it to Qdoba, which I absolutely love. It is set up like a Qdoda or Chipotle, where you go down the line and tell them what ingredients you want in your entrée. 

Pros:
Nice, clean eating area
Staff was friendly
Food was tasty
Burrito tortilla did not stick to your teeth like I've noticed at other places
Outdoor eating space

Cons:
They charge extra for guac, queso, and fajitas. It wasn't very clear on what was extra and what wasn't so I just stuck to rice, beans, shredded cheese and salsa. The end result was good tasting, but not as good as Qdoba. Since I can get it free over there, I don't want to spend extra for it!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place since it's within my pants radius (that is, the distance I'm comfortable traveling from my apartment without feeling like I really need to put effort into getting dressed.)  I think it just opened within the last couple weeks, so I stopped in on Wednesday after I got back from an out of town trip & didn't feel like making dinner.  I just got a basic chicken burrito, no beans, add guac.  

My issues:
-- The tortilla.  This is supposed to be their big selling point, but it's nothing like a real tortilla.  Yes, they press and cook it fresh in front of you.  The one I received was chewy almost to the point of being gummy.  I was not impressed.   
-- The flavors.  I filled my burrito with marinated chicken, pico, hot salsa, lettuce and guacamole.  None of it had any distinct flavor, nor did the salsa have any kick.  

On top of that, there were several employees just standing around while I waited.  When one finally decided to help me, he had to ask what meat I wanted three times since he wasn't paying attention the first two.  My tortilla ripped while they were trying to roll my burrito so they transferred 3/4 of the contents into a new tortilla.  The rest were thrown away with the old tortilla so a quarter of my burrito was lost.  I know I'm being nit-picky here, but nothing seemed to go smoothly.

In general, I just was not impressed.  I'll keep driving the extra mile to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Went in right after they had opened and clearly had not made the chicken fresh, seeing as it was mealy. The rice was cold as well, and the guac was brown and soupy. MUCH rather go to Chipotle or Qdoba than this place."}
{"text":"Very unlike chipotle && unpleasant, did not taste nearly as fresh as chipotle && the flavor was terrible I threw my whole entire bowl away. I will never consider going here again"}
{"text":"Average American-Mexican food. I had the vegetarian burrito. Peppers, black beans, and the hot salsa. Peppers were a bit too chewy. Rice was good. Salsa was OK. Tortillas made on site, pretty good. They mix up the contents of your burrito, which I do like. Good service. Quick lunch. Clean and plenty of seating. Even so, not much different than the other 'burrito' chains around."}
{"text":"Panchero's is my go-to late night dinner. The food is made quickly, consistently, and is flavorful. It is very similar to Qdoba and Chipotle, but I would say I prefer to eat here rather than the other similar options on University Ave. I appreciate that they make the tortillas straight from dough rather than heating up old tortillas. This prevents the edges from getting undesirably tough. I usually get the carnitas tacos, and they are always delicious. 

My only complaint is about the atmosphere. Whenever I go to eat there, I am the only customer. It doesn't really create a good vibe. However, in their defense I do go there around 10 pm so not many customers are to be expected.

I definitely recommend going there if you like carnitas!"}
{"text":"My brother kept telling me to try this place.  He said it was like a Chipotle but better.  I have to admit, before trying this place I was kind of a Chipotle snob but after several weeks of nagging, I finally decided to take his word for it and go check the joint out.  It's a bit far of a drive from my place of employment but I decided to take the trip anyway to see what all the fuss was about.  

It's kind of tucked away in a busy shopping center near In N' Out Burger and Starbucks so I was a bit surprised to see that it was hardly busy for a weekday around lunch time.  It had a nice atmosphere, nothing special and I was impressed with the fact that they make the tortillas right in front of you even though I opted for a burrito bowl (fewer calories)!    The first time I came to this place I was a vegetarian so I was a bit concerned about getting a good source of protein.  However, they gave me a generous portion of rice and black beans which were quite tasty.  My favorite part was the fajita style veggie mix consisting of green peppers, red and white onions to name just a few.  To top it off, I added sour cream (guace is extra), cheese, lettuce and salsa on the side.  The mild salsa was fairly decent and I also got the chance to sample the queso dip and corn salsa mix which were both delicious.  One thing I did like is that they will allow you to sample any item on the menu before putting it in your burrito or bowl.  The second time I ate here, I came back with a co-worker and got the same thing but with grilled chicken and it was even better!  On both occasions, I got a huge bag of chips for like $.50 cents and a drink.  

Overall, the food is good and it doesn't leave you feeling bloated or torn up like Chipotle does.  However, my only complaint is the price (this also goes for Chipotle).  I mean for casual dining Mexican food, it was way overpriced although the portions are more generous compared to what you get elsewhere.  Despite that, it is good to have on occasion when you're tired of the usual blend of overpriced Mexican food.  I will definitely be back looking to try new things!"}
{"text":"Came here because my sister had a coupon for a free burrito.  This place is like a copy cat of Chipotle BUT with much less flavor and all the fixings are extra.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one night to try it out. Completely rude staff and terrible, terrible food. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite. I'm addicted. Can't stop eating burritos. No, but seriously, I've only had great experiences here. The staff are friendly and helpful, they even take the time to remember their regulars' orders."}
{"text":"I'm praying that I don't get violent diarrhea.  Not good. The steak was bland and the chicken tastes like what I could best describe as wet noodles...very strange.  Won't ever need to go back.  Stick with Moes/Chipotle/Qdoba."}
{"text":"Service was pretty poor; the staff was a bit rude. The food wasn't that good either - felt like a bad Chipotle outlet. I'd rather go to Chipotle any day."}
{"text":"So I decided to give pancheros a second shot and boy was I happy I did. Second time around I got the carnitas with the queso sauce and the hot sauce and have never been happier. If chipotle and pancheros were right next to each other I would definitely choose pancheros every time."}
{"text":"Best burritos EVER! The way they make their tortillas fresh is incomparable. The queso can be a little thick, but it's still great. Better than chipotle by far."}
{"text":"The tortillas here are pressed right in front of you, but I thought it tasted doughy.  Also the fillings were skimpy and made my tortilla sopping wet by the time I sat down.  The taste was just ok.  Also as I pressed the button to fill my fountain drink, it all came spraying at me in all different directions soaking my hair, clothes, and Even in my shoes.  When my fiancé went and told an employee about it the only response was \" oh. The sign fell down \". Not even a sorry or offering me some paper towels.  So needless to say since I don't like shitty food, shitty service, and taking a root beer shower, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been to Panchero's, and I probably won't go back.  If I ever find myself in that center again, I will be at either Jersey Mike's, Starbucks or Yogurtland!  The flavor of the food was decent.....but they were so stingy on everything that it pissed me off before I even got a chance to taste the food!

Get this...they measure out the cheese in this little scoop....are you kidding me!?!?!  It was probably an ounce of cheese, which if you are like me, is not nearly enough cheese to go around.  Also, when I said that I didn't want the rice, just beans, I still got the same amount of beans that a person who ordered rice got....beans are like the cheapest food on the planet....don't be so stingy!  The carnitas was pretty tasty, but I just felt like I was being so jipped as far as the value and the portions went that in order for me to return...a mass destruction of all the Rubio's, Chipotle's and Baja Fresh's would have to occur...and even then...I would probably still pick taco bell....you just can't beat 89 cent bean burritos!"}
{"text":"Do you like Chipotle but hate when it gets a little too tasty? Then try Panchero's!"}
{"text":"Lol really, whg is every one saying this.place is the bizness, wait its the gringos that think its real mexican food hah, this place sucks ass, poor quality food , try and be like.chipotle never , they had a cilantro lime rice was horrible,  cant compare chipotles rice to this crap, their meets were awfull, really dry,  ive had enough too much too complain, bye i did forget to mention the employee male looked like he was all twacked out on drugs"}
{"text":"There are absolutely no reasons I can think of that will ever convince me to give this place another chance. I saw a blonde man (I assume he is the Manager) yell profanity at an employee and watched him take the employees work shirt off when the employee quit, and then that individual had to walk between the people making food without a shirt, then they walked home. That is completely disgusting. I also am aware of an alleged termination of an employee that resulted in this same individual throwing items while yelling at a woman hr just fired. Whenever I go in at night I always see the same bald creepy dude standing around watching TV and when I get to him to pay he insists on smiling at me with what teeth he has left, and he always smells bad. I understand some people can't help it but I really don't think he should be working around food. I also heard they had no hot water for quite some time because corporate didn't want to spend the money for repairs. 

The quality of the food is passable, but all the cons outweigh the few good points of this restaurant. I know that there's a decent chance th employees I encounter don't give 2 shits. The only good point regarding staff was the crew that I almost always saw on Friday nights. After the last time, the bald dude said a couple of thing I'd rather not repeat...and with that I decided I was nevergoing to spend another penny there. I don't want to die from negligent employees."}
{"text":"This is definitely a great place to eat. I was amazed that the tortillas are freshly done. Although this was my first time visiting, I am impressed with their food and would recommend for everybody to try them out. If you like Chipotle, try them out, the fresh tortillas give food a better flavor."}
{"text":"In my experience the food has always been fresh and the staff is very friendly.  You always are made to feel welcome and that they appreciate your business."}
{"text":"Fast service, friendly staff.  Not a huge selection, similar menu and prices to Chipotle but better rice."}
{"text":"Probably some of the worst customer service I have ever encountered. They didn't say hi, little to no communication towards food selection, and the associates did not say thank you or good bye. I will never come back to the pancheros on Neil in champaign ever again."}
{"text":"I truly wish these kind of places didn't exist. They give a bad name to mexican food. For reference I just ordered the standard array of rice, beans, salsas, etc.

As others have said, go to Chipotle or Qudoba if you want the american/mexican style burritos. This place is simply not worth spending your time, money, daily allotment of calories, etc.."}
{"text":"Yup, i'm gunna say it... This place is better that chipotle. They mix the ingredients together in your burrito! simple and awesome."}
{"text":"Pancheros is not what it used to be, the last 2 chicken burritos that I have had were BAD! Chicken was very dry and tough, rice was dry also. None of the ingredients looked very fresh. Good cheese dip and chips though"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled -- Pancheros is no Chipotle. I've tried this place twice and each time I was disappointed. First, I got a burrito. Those tortillas they rave about are not anything special... they taste like the \"cook at home\" tortillas that grocery stores sell. I was not a fan of the rice or the skimpy other ingredients.

I am currently sitting here eating my salad, this is going to be my last dish from Pancheros. I do not believe that the ingredients are fresh. The chicken is bland and the dallop of guacamole is not worth a dollar extra. Where's my salad dressing?

Let's not forgot the customer service. Today I was greeted with servers who seemed bored, unhappy, and were not audible with the loud music. 

I will not be going to Pancheros again. I am unsatisfied, feeling ripped off, and throwing my lunch in the garbage."}
{"text":"Small portions.   Staff look very unhappy and are difficult to understand (mumble)."}
{"text":"If I was able to rate less than one star I would. Please do not eat here. Not only is this place over priced, the meat is cold and does not have any flavor. I am so disappointed"}
{"text":"Husband and I stopped to try this... Tortilla was the best, but everything else was tasteless! I believe Taco Bell is superior to this with more flavor and less cost!

Won't spend my money at this chain!"}
{"text":"Panchero's has great fresh tasting tortillas and the staff was friendly. Sadly, that was all that impressed me on my last visit. Those coming to dine with children should know that Panchero's does not have an official kids menu or meal and they do not sell milk. Seems very odd to me as it gives the restaurant a non kid friendly feel and seems that from a business perspective causes them to lose customers. The soda machines are dirty and lack any kind of selection, especially diet sodas. There is a decent outside seating area, however, it is littered with cigarette butts which make for an unappetizing experience. As we were eating our meals outside a small child sitting at the table next to us picked a cigarette butt up from the ground much to her parents and our dismay. But who could blame her when they are scattered everywhere? I think this place could implement major improvements by cleaning up the restaurant, adding a kids menu or at a minimum selling milk and maybe offering some fresh topping choices such as limes."}
{"text":"This is another place that came from Iowa City that I ate at all the freakin' time in college. This place is like Chipotle but I think this has better ingredients: tastier meat, fresh pressed tortillas, creamier cheese, and a quesadilla option.

However, I don't think they captured the magic of the Iowa City versions. I think the owner needs to come and figure out what's going on. I still would rather go here for a burrito than Chipotle."}
{"text":"Am I in an overpriced Chipotle?! Yes I am. The food is the same. So, if you like Chipotle, this is your spot. This place copied Chipotle. Chipotle copied Taco Bell. So basically, you are eating overpriced Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I have not eaten at the restaurant and can only comment on their food for a company catered lunch. 

I was blown away with how fresh the food was. The green chili salsa was excellent. The meal was simple, tacos and burritos. Maybe I was hungry but the black beans and rice were really really good 

I am a big fan of Carolina's in Phoenix but this was a step above. I will definitely be eating there again."}
{"text":"I could give it 3.5 stars, but couldn't do 4 stars.  This location has always been clean when I have eaten there, but I normally get a burrito to go. I do find their chicken burrito with queso sauce very tasty, but I think the price is a little high (very similar to qdoba and chipotle). Also, extras (queso,  guacamole, etc) are costly. But I have to say, when they make your tortilla in front of you and when they mix up your ingredients after they make your burrito, that sets them apart from their competitors."}
{"text":"Panchero's is a below-average hybrid of Chipotle and Qdoba. Their gimmick of \"made fresh to order\" tortillas does little to disguise the blandness of their burrito fillings. This place has nothing to recommend it above either of its competitors."}
{"text":"Great place on the near west side to get inexpensive, fresh, fast food.  Love the made to order tortillas."}
{"text":"Chipotle-like. Here are the differences: fresh tortillas, fresh jalapenos (the bright green kind; not the pickled kind); they mix the ingredients for you which makes a difference when you bite into a burrito. Also, I paid $7 for a huge huge burrito. I cant speak about their other food, but their burrito is very delicious. Quality of the food is same as Chipotle."}
{"text":"$1 extra for grilled peppers and onions is ridiculous. Rather go to Chipotle food is better and not so many up charges and their portions are big enough to make 2 meals out of it. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is a solid fast food burrito bar. The make fresh tortillas to order that is by far the best part about this place. The queso is also very delish! My husband got the steak and I got the chicken and both were very good. If you want spicy I would recommend adding jalapeños because without it there isn't much spice. I also like how they mix the ingredients up before wrapping up your burrito. It's always annoying to get a big bite of meat or rice with nothing else. 

I do wish they had wheat tortillas or brown rice to help make it a little more healthy. But hey, it is a burrito, right?"}
{"text":"I gave you guys plenty of tries, of the 5 times I've went here, 3 times there has been no fajita veggies and I got minimal proportions, like barely a cup of rice and a 1/2 cup of beans. Not worth the nearly 8 dollars I paid. Avoid this place"}
{"text":"I'm glad that you list on Yelp and on your door that you close at midnight on Friday, while your doors are locked at 11:25 PM. Please consider updating your page or your employees on your hours. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"What Poncheros is in AZ now!!!!!  How lucky could we get!!!!!  Poncheros is compared to Chipolte but just so everyone knows who has never tried it before.... It is a million times better.  They even freshly press EVERY tortilla from fresh dough each time you order.  I came to AZ and tried Chipolte because everyone raved about it, well when I walked in I immediately though of Poncheros and became very excited!  Unfortunately to my utter dissapointment is did not even come close to how good Poncheros is.  Sooooo I hope all you Chipolte lovers will give this new to AZ spot a chance, I guarantee you will not be dissappointed!"}
{"text":"I ordered a veggie salad.  The lettuce was soggy, the roasted veggies were lifeless and the staff seemed disinterested.  The guy that was in charge was distracted and sweating profusely - to the point that I was concerned that it might drip in the food.  The other server was barely aware that I was even in the building.  She kept gazing out the front window and gave the impression that she did not give a rat's behind about my food.  :("}
{"text":"This Pancheros is far below average than other Pancheros. I would much rather go to Chipotle or Qdoba. When I arrived today the employees were smug, not friendly, and out of almost everything. While you don't expect perfect service all the time, I was hoping to actually get what I wanted for my meal! Simply put, skip Pancheros and go to the Chipotle down the road."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time, was not confused as the menu is pretty similar to that of chipotle. Food is okay. But the staff is rude. Ordered a burrito and it was pretty good with hot tomatillo sauce on it. I'll come again for the food."}
{"text":"Oh my God. My friends and I went here after a round of golf. So satisfying. The chicken burrito was awesome. I added guacamole to it. And the staff was very friendly as we commented about the hugest burrito being made. They make the tortillas fresh right in front of you? I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had a chicken burrito, my boyfriend had the carnitas. Both were good. Tortillas are super fresh. Excellent queso and blue corn chips. Friendly and fast service. No, it's not Chipotle. But if I wanted Chipotle I would have gone there instead. Not sure why this place gets such harsh reviews for that reason."}
{"text":"Visited Pancheros for lunch one day last week with some coworkers. I know they're known for their fresh homemade tortillas, but I opted for a bowl. Perhaps this is why I wasn't wowed? Anyway, the bowl was good, steak a little on the salty side, but overall tasty. I had hopes for lettuce, pico, and other fresh toppings, but there was queso... I'll give it another try and see if the tortillas help to give this place another star or two, but based on my first visit, I'd say it's a good (but not great) spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Ugh this was the worst mexican food I've had in the past couple months I've visited Phoenix. I only went because it was walking distance from my hotel The chicken was dry, flakey, and tasteless. The corn and salsa was absolutely terrible. Good service but awful food. Chipotle all the way.

UPDATE ONE HOUR LATER: sick on toilet! DO NOT EAT HERE
DITTO OTHER REVIEWERS"}
{"text":"Very bland, underwhelming food. If you were to rate Panchero's against other restaurants in the same class such as Chipotle, Qudoba, Burrachos, etc, Panchero's is pretty far down on the list. Taco Bell is just across the street; that would probably be a better option."}
{"text":"I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Panchero's as I am from Iowa City, home of the original Panchero's location. It is a staple in downtown Iowa City nightlife; there's really nothing better than a ginormous messy burrito at 2am after a night of drinking.

I don't visit this store as often as I should. Their burritos are far superior to Chipotle in my opinion. The fresh pressed tortillas are super yummy. My go to burrito entails chicken, rice, queso (which carries an up charge but it is SO worth it!), cheese, sour cream, pico and mild sauce. Yes, this is my haven for feeding my inner fat kid ;) 

I think Panchero's is very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. Today I got a burrito, small fountain drink, and a side of chips and guac for $12 and some change.

Be warned - the burritos are massive! I dare you to eat the whole thing in one sitting."}
{"text":"Unlock the power of Cilantro!!

This is a nice place to get some very fresh food- but it's like a milquetoast version of Chipotle. It's kinda like Mexican...but, really?.... No Cilantro?

maybe it's a Mexican version of Subway."}
{"text":"Today I decided to stop by this place for lunch. I've passed it several times and was happy to see another option to the \"Chipotle and Qdoba\" type places. I should have turned around and gone to Chipotle. Food was bland. The black beans seemed to be sitting in water. Chicken didn't have much flavor (Maybe the steak is better?). Rice had a hint of flavor, but not the lime taste as advertised. Queso sauce wasn't bad and I liked it slightly more than the one at Qdoba. However, the small bag of chips they serve with it was laughable. I wound up spending $10 for a burrito bowl and side of chips and queso but didn't think it was worth it. The people were friendly enough. And the place was pretty much empty aside from the other couple that came in after me. They have some work to do - not sure that I will be going back."}
{"text":"My go to here is the burrito. Today I had the chicken quesadilla and it was good. The burrito is better though. I highly recommend trying he tufu here. I am not a tufu fan in general but they let me try before I buy and it is actually really good. 

The quesadilla allowed me to really taste the fresh shell that is pressed in front of you. It kind of reminded me of nonbread. 

Please note though that this is a quick meal type of place. Don't go with the expectation of a 5 star dinner. The food is good, hot, and consistent.  That's all I need when traveling."}
{"text":"We had this catered for a quick work lunch and it was amazing. At chipotle I always get the steak on the side because it is so fatty I have to pick through it. Here the steak was lean and delicious. The rice was amazing and the salsa verse was sooooo good! Loved it."}
{"text":"keep hearing mixed reviews about this place so I got myself a chicken burrito there today.  It was ok, nothing special, they charge extra for the veggies, hot sauce was not spicy at all and the rice was meh.  Chipotle is way better, imo"}
{"text":"Panchero's is similar to Chipotle, with a few twists.  I end up going to Chipotle about half the time, and Panchero's about half the time.  Since I'd give Chipotle a 4-star average review, I figure that means Panchero's deserves the same.  Still, it's 4-star in the realm of fast burritos.

Panchero's touts that they don't use pre-packaged tortillas, which is true - they make it on a press right there (although I can't say if they make the doughh on-site or not).  I'd say this does make for a slightly better tortilla, but not good enough to warrant going here instead of Chipotle.  Fortunately, that's not the only difference.

One simple but effective step Panchero's does is simply mixing the ingredients together before wrapping the burrito.  I love Chipotle, but it's really annoying when you get all the lettuce on one side, three-quarters of the pork on the other, and so forth.  No such issues at Panchero's.  Toppings are pretty similar, with Panchero's winning points for their recent addition of freshly diced jalapeno peppers, and the only one I've been charged extra for is guacamole, which is pretty standard.  On the other hand, I personally prefer Chipotle's cilantro lime rice to Panchero's rice - this will be a matter of personal preference.

The chips are made with blue corn, and are pretty tasty.  If you just get the chips, they're only 50 cents for a pretty sizeable portion, which is a bargain eating out if you ask me.  I don't always get them, but when I do I'm satisfied.

The quesadillas were disappointing, but I didn't have high expectations for them to begin with.  You go to this sort of place for the burrito.

Service is okay.  It's not bad, and the staff at the Gammon location are friendlier than the staff at the Fitchburg location (by the Super Target).  But the Chipotle on Old Sauk has much more enthusiastic, outgoing staff.  So if I'm not hankering for one of Panchero's slight advantages, I'm liable to go to Chipotle instead."}
{"text":"Have eaten at Pancheros many times and love the quality of the food and the service. Friendly staff, fresh cooked meat, nice variety of ingredients, and the coolest tortilla machine that presses the fresh dough into a flat tortilla! They have tacos, burritos, burrito bowls, salads, and quesadillas...all delicious. I wish they would put more meat on the quesadilla (they only put one scoop), but the cheese they use is great. Every other menu option comes with ample amounts of ingredients. Oh, and their salsas and sauce options are great! They even sell the sauce for less than $4 a bottle. Prices are a little higher, but I think it's worth it for the quality of food you are getting. Definitely a place worth going to!"}
{"text":"Below average build your own burritos. 

Ingredients seem lower quality than Qdoba and Chipotle, extras cost more than both restaurants. 

Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Who likes this place??

This is my second try here, I wanted to give it another chance, but it was just as bad as the first time.

I got the burrito bowl and its just a bunch of low quality ingredients thrown in a pile. Taco Bell is way better, so thats saying something. Also, Taco Bell is cheaper. I paid 6.59 for my burrito bowl and I still felt hungry afterwards.

If you want a real quality burrito bowl for the same price, go to Chipotle, hands down. Plus Chipotle includes guacamole for free with veggie bowls, this place its extra.

The only cool thing about this place is that they are freaking everywhere, and they are new and clean on the inside. I don't know how they sustain themselves though, who comes here?"}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of not-so-great \"Mexican\" fast food, but this place makes Chipotle look authentic. 
If you're looking for some good gut-rot, you've found the right place!
Aside from the salsa verde being nice & hot, the only flavor in my chicken bowl was cilantro. And lots of it. 
Go to the aforementioned Chipotle. Go to something ending in -berto's or -beto's. Just skip this place. 
If anyone needs me this afternoon, I'll be in stall #2."}
{"text":"Our first time will definitely be our last, my girlfriend and I went in there and there was nobody there.  Monday I get it, but the employee with greenish hair gave my girlfriend the dirtiest look ever, and rushed us through the process.  My girlfriend didn't hear her because she was mumbling, and then she literally yelled back \"do you want veggies or queso\". I think she could tell that we noticed her obvious annoyance that we were there and started calling us sir and mam. She even apologized for the \"long\" wait, when there wasn't any one else there, and if she would've been a better employee, it would've been a better experience. We will never spend another dime in this establishment.  I manage a very busy and popular restaurant in tempe, and am always about supporting fellow restaurants, but won't feel uncomfortable getting my dinner."}
{"text":"Very bland, flavorless chicken.  Tortillas are made to order, but also taste like nothing.  Website advertises the fact that all their restaurants have Cholula hot sauce available, which would have helped add some flavor to the awful meal, but there was actually none available.  Workers were not friendly."}
{"text":"It's great if you order the right things! My go to Burrito is Chicken with Pinto Beans, Queso Added, sour cream, lettuce, shredded cheese, hot salsa, and diced jalapenos! Quite spicy, but extremely good.  Too many people give this place a bad rap! It's pretty damn good quick americanized Mexican food!  Try the burrito I suggested, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the service here. The past few times have not been pleasent. I walked in to find an employee pouring milk in the queso. I smiled and said hi. No response. Just looked annoyed a patron came in. Went to the back and another employer came out. No greeting. Did not change his gloves. Also had no hat on. My burrito was not mixed well and fell apart right away. Everything in it was lukewarm! By the time I ent to eat, it was cold.  There used to be excellent, positive service here but since the new management, everything went down hill.  The sanitation and hygiene of these employees should be addressed. Sagging pants while making food with dishoveled, unkempt hair while preparing food that is not even hot really needs to be addressed."}
{"text":"Bad customer service, bad hygeine, ignorant of their own menu.

Let me start with hygeine. The guys working the line look grungie. One had cut his thumb and the bandage looked pretty old.

I asked for a burrito and was excited about the fresh tortilla but the guy made it way too big and too fast on the press. It came out crispy, there was no one behind me so no rush.

I got the burrito filled then it came to salsa. I wanted the hottest salsa and I love Tomatillos so I asked for the Tomatillo Hot Salsa. Bandage guy said they dont serve it to which I said, \"it's on your menu.\" He thought i was saying Tapatio then he thought I said \"Tomate\" which is in all of their salsas *forehead slap*. I pull up tomatillo on my phone and show it to him and he pointed to the red one. Obviously not right. 

He then told me to calm down, i was calm but the noise level is high in there so i had to talk louder. He then explained to me that i am in a different state and was talking over me from that point on. 

Anyways this place sucked, the burrito was small and crispy and these guys have no idea what Mexican food is."}
{"text":"I love Panchero's, it is in my top 3 of fast food Mexican restaurants in Madison.  I usually go to the one on University Ave- I don't know what it is, but it's either the rice, queso, chicken, or guac that makes Panchero's so much tastier than Chipotle or Qudoba- my theory is that it's the rice.  

But when I went to the Panchero's on Gammon Rd today, the woman who packaged and bagged my food licked her fingers (EEW) to separate the bag handles, then proceeded to touch the container that my burrito bowl was in before putting it into its bag.  I was so grossed out.  

Panchero's employees should be educated that they should not lick their fingers in general (this goes for all humans), let alone when preparing customers' food.  As a nurse (but even for a consumer without nursing knowledge), during flu season I do not want to risk coming down with the flu due to some idiot's lack of knowledge of communicable disease processes."}
{"text":"Just had a chicken burrito bowl and it was sooooooo tasty! The meat was moist and flavorful and our server had no problem adding shredded lettuce to the bottom of the bowl at our request. The Guacamole was perfect and the blue corn chips were a nice change from the usual. This place is set up just like chipotle, but for some reason the bowl just seemed a little more juicy than chipotle! Very good! Lost one star for charging a buck for grilled veggie topping...I usually get that at chipotle to feel healthy but am too cheap to pay for it:)"}
{"text":"So to me this place beats out chipotle, especially now with how their meats have changed. The one thing that I still love from chipotle is the chips and salsa. However with everything else this place is giving them a run for their money. The tortillas are pressed fresh from dough  and you can taste the freshness. Another thing I liked is that with your burrito they mix all the ingredients so you get a bit of everything each time you take a bite. Their queso in my opinion makes the food taste that much better. Their veggies and salsas are also good the only thing is that the lettuce needs to be shredded more, the pieces were a little big and I wasn't a fan of their chips. The guacamole was really good, overall if I had to choose I would get a burrito from here and just a bag of chips from chipotle cause this place is way better on everything else"}
{"text":"Very pricey - $14.65 for bowl with chip and dip and a small drink. Outrageous this is a knockoff Chipolte   I predict they will be out of business in 90 days."}
{"text":"It's rare to find a place that serves burritos that isnt over the top greasy. The burritos at Pancheros taste great and are flavorful without the heavy bloated feeling afterwards. The tortillas are soft and warm and the ingredients are fresh. The service here is very friendly and efficient.  Although I prefer Chipotle, Pancheros is usually my go to place for takeout Mexican because of its convenient location."}
{"text":"Has it really been four years since I have dined here? Well things have only gotten better if your a burrito fan. They now press the fresh dough in front of you and then they put that fresh tortilla on the grill for the burrito. The chicken is marinated all-white meat and you can really put just about anything extra in the burro for free except for guac and queso I believe. And at least on the day I visited, the guy working was an expert at his craft of rolling the burrito unlike the amateurs at that other sickly chain. It is still about seven bucks and a filling lunch or dinner. Green sauce is also quite tasty."}
{"text":"The people who work during the lunch hours from 12:00PM to 01:00pm are extermely rude, they seemed agigated that I used a coupon. The male genetleman, kept asking the girl, if I put anything else in my burrito( i.e. queso or Gucamole). He asked both girls. The tortillas are undercooked. I took the order to go and purchased a a large beverage. I am not sure, what these employees problems are. There was one male and two females. It appeared, the male was the manager. I am from CA and I am pretty familar with Panchero's and have always had a great experience, but Pancheros in AZ has left a bad test in my mouth. I will never recommend this place to anyone and will tell everyone about my experience. One word of advice to your the owner of this franchise, invest in training your employees to have great customer service skills. Customer service is everything."}
{"text":"apparently this place was around before chipotle was even created.

good food, better customer service than chipotle.

would return again. \"healthier\" taste of food compared to chipotle, not sure if that makes sense, but try it out!"}
{"text":"Typical Mexican fast food chain. BUT THEY BOB IT!

But other than that, there's virtually no difference. Slightly cheaper than Chipotle's and Qdoba's, though not as tasty. You win some, you lose some."}
{"text":"Superior to other burrito places. They also sponser the local football team. I think cilantro is the devil and it's easy to get around at pancheros. Always nice folks as well. I specifically like how they mix up your ingredients so each bite has a variety of flavor in it so you're not getting giant bites of just rice."}
{"text":"The pico de gallo had canned jalepenos in it.  Nast-y.  The other salsa we tried tasted like tomato paste.  Really bad.  I didn't see any fresh tortillas, just a tortilla thrown on a warming plate.  Not nearly as flavorful as Qdoba or Chipotle."}
{"text":"So after driving by this place everyday I decided to give it a shot. I originally went there on a lunchdate thinking it was a sit down and order establishment. Well I was wrong so at that point we went elsewhere. So I went back for carryout tonight. In a nutshell I'm not impressed by it all, but there are some silver linings.

Service - Meh, middle of the road. Not bad, not good. The employees looked annoyed and didn't want to be there. But I was asked about sides and options and got a \"thank you\" after transaction so I can't burn them too bad for not whistling while they work. 
6/10

Food Quality - I ordered the steak quesadilla cause I love fried tortillas and lots of cheese inside. Well, I was very disapointed. Granted they press the tortillas there and fry it up in front of you, mine was not very fried. I worked at restaurants and cooked quesadillas on \"mexi night\" and mine were always crispy and hot. This one was merely warmed up and retained little heat during the 1 mile drive home. While the quesadilla wasn't much better than taco bells version, the chips and queso and guacamole were excellent. Very good guac!! It was rich and chunky unlike canned stuff. Maybe I'll just stick to burritos if I go there cause the steak was tasty. 
5/10 only because of the guac, 3/10 without it.

Price - $5 for that undercooked quesadilla is a sham. $3 tops. The chips and queso were also a bit pricey at $3. I spent $8.50 on the quesadilla, chips, queso and guacamole. I felt like it was a $5 meal in the end.
3/10

Experience/Vibe - Very plain much like other tex mex joints like Qdoba and Chipotle, only a little worse. The dining setup is awkward and weirdly lit. 
5/10

Overall - 19/40. 

When the sides impress me more than the main dish I can only give two stars tops. Im sure it would be closer to 3 if I ordered the burrito since thats just easier than a quesadilla but I don't really like burritos that much, so guys lets work on that tortilla frying and better portions!"}
{"text":"Service: 58% F There is a lady who I think is a manager there that is very rude. One employee was helping me with my order (He seemed to be new). I have lots of patience when it comes to new employees, so I didnt mind him taking his time. But then the manager came over,  and shoved him (literally) out of the way and took his place instead of helping him. (I about yelled something), and then she messed up my order. 

Cleanliness: 60% D- LOTS of cross-contamination red flags here. 

Food: 83% B The food is good...when it is fresh. And its only fresh like 60% of the time."}
{"text":"My mom and I made a last minute lunch decision and were craving something kind of simple and quick. My mom was craving something kind of Mexican. Close and convenient, Pacheros! Havnt heard any negative comments so we figured we'd give it a try. So we pulled in and went inside. Inside was clean and not too busy considering it was 1230. But anyways, the staff was nice and very helpful, considering we had never been before. Although it's pretty simple, you pick and choose. Also they informed us of the toppings that would cost extra which was nice, rather than being surprised at the register. We took our food home and it was pretty good for being a chain walk thru. I had a bowl with rice, chicken, shredded cheese, melted cheese, pico, and sour cream. The portions where substantial more than enough to fill me up. The price is pretty reasonable considering how much food you get. For 2 bowls with 2 extra cost toppings each was 16$.  
 Although chains are not really my favorite, Pancheros was pretty good."}
{"text":"Service great.
Quality of food, horrible. 
Compatible to chipotle, but a lot worse. 
I liked the idea of fresh pressed home made dough, but it was almost all the way cooked. 
All the ingredients were in covered containers and did not look fresh at all. Probably due to the lack of customers at the establishment. Only one family eating, no one in line at 11:15am. 
I did get free chips and quest for checking in on yelp, but the chips were too salty for me. My co workers on the other hand did enjoy them."}
{"text":"Why I always go to Moe's.  How do you run out of freaking chicken at 1:30 in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Better than chipotle! They have amazing tortillas pressed fresh right in front of you. And the queso is the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"As a die hard mexican foodie, I would have to rate the food as about a 3.5, but what's with the \"up charge\" for cheese and sour cream?  I've always been a big Chipotle fan and am willing to pay nearly $10 for a burrito, chips/salsa and a large drink, but this place really irritated me.  I asked for lettuce in my burrito and received both a dirty look and about five small shreds...WTH???

Yes, the tortilla was pretty yummy and the meat fairly tasty, but I really hate being nickel and dimed for everything.  I'll stick with Fili B's for the cheaper and more authentic version and Baja Fresh for the Americanized Tex-Mex (or whatever) version with a free salsa bar."}
{"text":"For those reviews that say this is like Chipotles, that's not entirely accurate. The setup is, but the flavor of the food is vastly different. The meats here are in a gravy, which is not our preference. They only have white rice, which we didn't try. Their chips are blue corn.  Tasty but not like Chipotles with the hint of lime. Their Queso was very good and not something that Chipotles offers. The tortillas were freshly made and quite tasty. We would probably come back to try a quesadilla and/or chips n queso, but we would not come back for the meat dishes because we didn't prefer the flavor. Service was good but nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"The food here is good. It's not outstanding, or anything to write home about, but it IS tasty.  

The whole making a tortilla in front of your eyes seems a little kitch-y to me, but so what? Everyone has to have a marketing ploy.

I've eaten in, and taken out, and the burrito quality is about the same.  Personally, I like Chipotle better, as I like the dressing on their veggie salad.

My one beef (amusing, since I only get the beans) is that they were a little too light handed with everything. I got hardly any guacamole or sour cream, and that is really what helps to make a delicious tasty burrito of goodness in my eyes.

Will I go back? Certainly, if it's on my way and I'm hungry. Will I choose to seek it out? Probably not."}
{"text":"Basically a Qdoba/Chipotle clone but the tortillas are made fresh before your eyes, pretty cool."}
{"text":"I always thought Pancheros was a local chipotle-clone and then I've come to find out it's from Iowa.  Well, being on the farm is much better than the California Tortilla Clone of Chipotle that is around the DC Area.  

Pancheros makes their tortillas for both their tacos and burritos daily, this you can most definitely tell by the taste.  They also have Chile Con Queso much to my chagrin, I just do not like that stuff.  There's also that free wifi which is quickly becoming a perk for everyone or you find yourself not attending to the meal for some reason.  The Grenade Green Chile or the Flavalcano Chile is a solid addition for the Burrito.

Processed through the line promptly, if you want two kinds of meat they'll split the servings unless you want double meat, found that different but also awesome if you desired a confluence of flavors.  1100 KCals for a lunch post 10k race was what the doctor ordered."}
{"text":"I went to school in Iowa and I can say that this place is as good as the ones out there. Their food is less salty than Chipotle. They hand press the tortillas, and their queso is the best I think I've ever had."}
{"text":"Simply put, The best fast service burrito place in Madison. The tortillas are ten times better than chipotle. Panchero's also mixes up your burrito before they fold it. Every bite is good. The only downside is that some employees are not consistent in their burrito folding ability. Sometimes the burrito will fall apart because of this."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of other burrito places/chains like this, but Pancheros is delicious and unique and may beat out the others I've been going to for years. Quality ingredients with LOTS of flavor, authentic, and perfectly spicy. The best part is the fact that they take fresh tortilla dough, put it in a tortilla press, and throw it on the grill for each individual order, right in front of you, which makes for the freshest tortilla you can get that melts in your mouth! I love the organic tofu option. It's spicy, cooked perfectly (not mushy), and is packed with flavor. All the salsas are great. My favorite was the super fresh roasted corn salsa and hot tomatillo salsa. Every ingredient is so good which makes for a burrito I will be obsessing about until I can go back for another!"}
{"text":"Better than both Chipotle and Cafe Rio. Enough said. Has the fresh tortillas like Cafe Rio, but the meat is as good as or better than Chipotle. The burrito with the fresh tortilla and high quality meat makes a great combo."}
{"text":"For many years, this has been my favorite go to place for burritos when I am passing through Fitchburg (I was happy and then sad when one came to and left Green Bay). The freshly made tortilla is what makes Panchero's burritos stand apart from other chains. On this visit, the grilled peppers and onions were fresh and crisp. A bit heavy on the rice but the excess fell out as I was eating my burrito! Would have liked lemon with my iced tea but otherwise I enjoyed the burrito I had been looking forward to all day! Located about a half mile off 151 by the Super Target for easy access when you are hungry"}
{"text":"Panchero's is a nice place to stop in for a quick burrito or quesadilla. It doesn't measure up Qdoba in my book, but it delivers a solid, fast meal. I have been to this location a few times and the service has been good.

I like the quesadillas best, but the burrito bowl and burritos are good, too. The hot salsa has a nice flavor and may be worth getting a side order of chips with. The ingredients are not always the freshest, so I end up picking certain things out, such as fatty parts of the meat and jalapeno tips. Overall, the food has satisfactory quality and flavors. 

Most people stick to steak and chicken, but I really recommend trying the carnitas and barbecoa for a more exciting meal. I find these meats to have much stronger, spicier flavors."}
{"text":"As I'm sure you know by now, Panchero's makes fresh tortillas whe you order and mixes the ingredients before wrapping the burrito.  Can we move on now? Please?!?

There are other places out there offering similar food, but I feel Panchero's does it better.  One big bonus over \"the big burrito maker that shall not be named\" is the ever important punch card.  I like to be rewarded for eating good food.

It's not the best food on the planet, but it's better than many others out there, and the salsas and fresh tortillas are my favorite parts of the burritos there.  Chipotle is over-hyped, in my opinion.  I like this place because the line is never \"Great Wall of China\" long."}
{"text":"I at me here Monday and was sick puking my guts out within 6 hours.  Definitely food poisoning. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Yum yum! I created my own burrito here which consisted of chicken and every other ingredient there is possibly to add and I have to say, this place is pretty damn good. The vegetables were fresh and the chicken was nice and moist. Also when biting into my burrito, I could taste all of the ingredients together, yum! However, it is kind of expensive, I mean not more than your average Chipotle or Qdoba though... I don't like that I had to pay to get veggies in my burrito, kinda seemed odd. Other than that, this place is awesome....will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent! First time here and so much better than chipotle/qdoba! Definitely heading back soon"}
{"text":"This place is very conveniently located for lunch breaks during the week and I must admit, if it weren't for the flavolcano hot sauce they have readily available, I wouldn't eat here. I love hot, hot, spicy, make my nose run food and they don't have it here, but the hot sauce helps. The only meat that I think is worth trying is the carnitas. Not a fan of the \"tender\" steak or chicken. Veggies are good, it's a shame they cost extra if you want them included. I think in order to make this food taste good, you have to go heavy on the toppings and make it messy. 

I consider cilantro a food group all on it's own. It blows my mind that they do not have cilantro here for me to yell \"MORE!\" at them when making my burrito."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've only had their burrito but it was great! In my opinion, the freshly made tortillas and fresh meat makes their burritos much better than Qdoba and Chipotle. 

At least give it a try, it's definitely worth it! You won't be disappointed!

Oh and I forgot to tell ya, they actually mix everything together before rolling the burrito. Finally someone is doing it right :)"}
{"text":"super fresh tortillas steamed in front of you.a nice nacho cheese queso sauce,comparable to chipoltle but better or for stoners,haha.i like it,fresh,freindly,blah blah.right behind the in out burger on scottsdale and rural."}
{"text":"$8 for mediocre burrito.  $1 extra for good sauteed veggies.  Carnitas were dry and flavorless.  Flour shell made fresh was cool.  Place is a blatant rip on Chipotle."}
{"text":"Love Mexican food. 

Lived next door to this spot for a year. 

Ate there twice. 

Both times was very below average. 

Clean, but unfriendly staff and subpar food. 

I work from home, so instead would drive a few miles down the road and deal with the asu line for Mexican from a different spot. Was still worth it. 

Too bad"}
{"text":"A mexican place coming out of Iowa is like an Italian joint coming out of China.  It just doesn't seem to make sense.  I also find it funny that the day of my visit, all the staff were white women (an older attractive woman, and two cute college girls).  Not a Mexican in sight.  

Its not really a problem, because Panchero's isn't really Mexican food.  This is a burrito joint similar to Chipotle or Qdoba.  

So if this place is just like whats already out there, why should you go?  

#1) Freshly pressed tortilla.  Its a gimmick, but a tasty one.  Somebody who reviewed said something like \"it doesn't taste like a real tortilla ... its too chewy.\"  Hey moron ... this is what a real tortilla, sans processed food preservatives, is supposed to taste like.  

#2) They mix the ingredients for you before folding your burrito.  Their burritos aren't as big as Chipotle, but at least you don't bite into it and get a giant mouthful of rice, and then a mouthful of meat.  Instead, you get a mix of all the ingredients in every mouthful.

All in all, the place is good, not great.  Nothing about the actual burrito (besides the tortilla) stood out, but thats not a bad thing.  It was filling, tasty, and a reasonable value.  I'll make it back there at some point in the future, but won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"We like the food here and actually go out of our way for the queso, which is why I think they should at least be accurate about the hours they say they are open on Yelp, Google, and their own website. At least update it if it's not consistent with the hours you are ACTUALLY going to be open. One star docked for every hour they said they'd be open tonight and were not. Thanks for the wasted trip."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! Way better than Moe's, Chipotle or quidoba! I really like how when ordering a burrito they mix all of the stuff up before wrapping it up!! I haven't seen anyone else do that. Tons of flavor and the steak was super tender"}
{"text":"Very mediocre food chain, the biggest issue I have with the place is their pricing. In almost any other restaurant like this when I order I almost always get simply chicken and rice in a bowl or sometimes in a burrito and it's never charged as a full bowl or burrito, but here it was. And after being charged the full price, the servings were very miniscule. I will give them some positives, the corn salsa was good when I tried it out of a friends bowl. They also have a nice selection of sauces by the drink counter. Probably won't be back though."}
{"text":"How many more knock Off Chipotles does the world need? Add Pancheros to the list. 
However this place is much better then Moe's Southwest Grill. Pancheros menu is limited much like Chipotles, Gauc is extra & they have Queso. Burritos are made with fresh ready to make tortillas. Honestly the burrito was nothing special and very forgettable. But hands down better then the other places like it. 

This location is in a new building. Decor is limited with lots of seating.  The staff the night we went was in the back and came out when we entered and it felt like they didn't care if we were there or not and just wanted to get our food made."}
{"text":"I like Panch.  burritos and burrito bowl ... But I am going to miss because location is going to close for ever.. From sept 5 2015"}
{"text":"Exactly like chipotle only the tortillas are delicious and made fresh right in front of you and they have queso cheese. 

Seriously best tortillas I've ever had. Period. Why isn't this place ever busy?"}
{"text":"Destroys chipotle every single time. Every meat is better. Has way more flavor and is very fresh. Mixing the burritos is genius. Double beef and queso in your burrito is a must. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things about this place but found myself slightly underwhelmed by the food. The guac was extremely salty; however, the queso was pretty good. The portion size on the tacos were surprisingly small but the flavor was good. Overall, it's not my first choice."}
{"text":"I noticed Pancheros one day while I was driving, so my 8-year-old daughter and I checked it out Saturday night. We really liked the look of the place with lots of modern touches. The two working there that night, Thomas and Larissa (sorry if I spelled the names wrong!), were great! Thomas quickly greeted us as we came in, and was really helpful with it being our first time there. He had a great personality and was good with talking to my daughter and helping her with all of the options. She really liked watching the tortilla press!

Aside from the great service, we really liked the food as well! We ordered 2 chicken tacos, a cheese quesadilla, and a burrito with carnitas. Needless to say, with just the 2 of us, we took some to go...the burritos are HUGE!! It was actually the width of my daughter's shoulders...we measured!! haha

There were very few people in the restaurant while we were eating, so hopefully more people start trying it! We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Can I even write a review with ZERO stars?  Negative stars?  THE most disgusting food to ever touch my lips. We threw our salty food away and hopped over to yogurt land."}
{"text":"Came here a few days ago and was really impressed. They press tortillas when you order them, making them taste extremely fresh and delicious. I like this place better than Chipotle. If you don't get their queso, you're making a huge mistake. Best queso around."}
{"text":"Ingredients tasted like they were sitting out for 3 days, tortilla was stale, the best part was that they mixed their burritos before they wrapped it. 

I'd rather eat a shoe"}
{"text":"Okay... Panchero's Mexican Grill is my new obsession. Truth be told, I avoided it for the longest time because I didn't think any burrito place could compete with Chipotle. Boy was I wrong!

Panchero's wins hands down in the showdown with Chipotle mostly because of their freshly pressed tortillas. They are so scrumptious that my mouth starts to water as soon as they pull the dough ball off of the tray. The tortillas is complemented by always fresh ingredients and completed with a swirl with the bob tool. Love the bob tool! Chipotle burritos always have layers but a Panchero's burrito insides are mixed so every bite has all the flavors. 

I will admit to going to Chipotle once after discovering Panchero's but I only went after much kicking and screaming. If only the had an iPhone app similar to Chipotle's. They have an app now but it only allows you to play a burrito making game rather than place an order."}
{"text":"Fresh pressed tortillas are so chewy and flavorful that I bought two extra to take home to make breakfast burritos. I always order the cheese quesadilla with black beans. Rice.veggies and it is huge and costs somewhere around $4.50. Parking lot is always clear with few people inside. I think their rear facing sign and entrance are to blame- certainly not the food."}
{"text":"Went into Pancheros today cause they have the best fast burrito out of any chain. Mainly because of the fresh tortilla and the fact that they mix it up with there bob tool. But anyway while I was there some stupid couple budged me in line to complain about there there quesadilla. Here's the complaint, \" umm sir, the chicken isn't distributed evenly in all 4 slices\" so the employee offered to make them a new one, very kind of him. So I ordered my burrito loading up with as much free topping as I can. But later this couple comes up and decided they need to push in front of other people to get tinfoil to take there new quesadilla to go which didn't seem like that big of a deal but wait there was more the gentleman of the couple decided that the trash can was to small so he professes to restaurant \"how do they expect me to throw away my garbage with a trash can this small\" after professing he throws it away with no problem at all. So basically what I am saying if you are a couple that needs perfectly distributed quesadilla and don't know how to use a trash can you should leave Wisconsin and go back to Illinois where you belong. As for this Pancheros it's just like all the other ones a good  burrito fast and at a fare price."}
{"text":"The old manager is gone, so this place has gone back to being average. They do have a new rewards system that works entirely through their app on your phone, so that's convenient."}
{"text":"I met some friends for a late lunch at Pancheros Mexican Grill.  The line was long however, they kept the line moving along nicely.  

When we went to find a table, most of the tables were dirty, but cleaned one off ourselves. The food was good and I the atmosphere was causal.

The menu is limited, but the entrees are good.  The tortillas are freshly pressed when you order your entrée  and you can select your preferences as you move along the quick-order line.

 I really enjoy the chicken quesadillas and the chicken tacos.  The meat is flavorful and moist.

So if your looking for an inexpensive, quick, and filling meal, give Pancheros a try."}
{"text":"Not nearly as good as chipotle. The vegetables were not fresh, salsa was mediocre. Guacamole was blackened due to age, lousy iced tea . Big disappointment."}
{"text":"First off...it's a burrito place.  Sorta like Chipotle.  One big difference is that they start with a ball of dough.  They pop it into a press and out comes a tortilla.  Very fresh.  Then the usual rice and beans and filling.  Etc.

I give it four stars as a burrito place.  I'm not comparing it to a steak house or a full Mexican place.  For what it is it's very good.  Very tasty, very fresh.  They even have a stamp card for frequent diners."}
{"text":"Sorry Panchero's, but you're salsa is all that you've got going for you. I've given the burrito bowl too many chances, I'm finally seriously just sticking to Chipotle when I'm craving a burrito bowl. Their fajita pepper fixings are a joke, it's mostly just huge chunks of onions. Whoever is slicing those onions needs some training. I picked them all out except for one that somehow was looked over and gave me the worst onion taste for hours. Their rice and beans are also bland and lack flavor. Only good thing about this place is the space and the fact that they sell their salsa in a glass bottle."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan I'm trying to figure or what I didnt like.  Could be the quality of the ingredients. Maybe not the freshest. Like chipolte it tasted very salty.  I think I prefer chipolte.  I had a beef burrito. Maybe I like fresh carne asada.  Even filbertos has better flavor beef. The diet coke was very good.  I hated the hot salsa."}
{"text":"First of all, the hours posted on Yelp are incorrect. They're open 11 AM until 9 PM. Don't go there 45 minutes before close. The workers did nothing to hide the fact that they were annoyed and didn't want to be there. The worker didn't care about throwing the top layer of queso film onto the burrito. Stingy doesn't even begin to describe the rest of the ingredients, like lettuce, shredded cheese, and pico. Panchero's is known for mixing the ingredients before wrapping the burrito. The spoons are in the logo after all. That wasn't going to happen with these workers. Of all the Panchero's I've been to across the U.S., this was by far the most disappointing."}
{"text":"My second visit in a week. A hell of a good burrito. Blows any Taco Bell away. No contest.  The burrito is in the class with La Bamba's. Very plump and affordable."}
{"text":"Quick and delicious, best part is the hot sauce and fresh tortillas. Huge servings! Tacos, burritos, bowls, whatever you'd like. You get to pick all your choices"}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars. Tiny portions for the price. Burritos were hardly palatable. Our pick up order was made completely wrong and when we complained, our second order was still wrong. I will never return and never ever recommend to a friend. Seriously, save your money. You can get twice the food at other Mexican restaurants for less and actually enjoy your food. As far as the service,  It was horrible. I had to explain multiple times what was wrong with my order (half of my food was missing) and by the end of it I was still missing food from my order that I had paid full price for. The food had no seasoning, the burritos were soggy, the queso was so set up that you couldn't even dip a chip into it, and the rice was way over cooked. I can't think of a single possitive thing to say. SKIP THIS RESTAURANT!!!"}
{"text":"You'll notice immediately that their restaurant concept is similar to a Chipotle or Qdoba however the fresh pressed tortillas are unique and do make a difference.  The burritos and burrito bowls are the way to go.  Skip the tacos.  I tried that once and it was just a huge mess."}
{"text":"It's virtually indistinguishable from Chipotle, though I'm admittedly no connoisseur! (I don't turn up my nose at the food at Chipotle, I just don't want to eat a day's worth of calories in one meal.) The salsa isn't terribly flavorful since it sits around all day. Same goes for the carnitas. But what can you expect? It's a decent fast food place, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"To me customer service is everything! Don't work at fast food/Restaurants if your not going to have the proper attitude!!....I placed an order online, upon arriving I noticed the place was pretty empty for it to be lunch time :-/ I inform the girl I was there to pick up, she goes to get my food and I tell her that's not what I ordered. Do you think she apologized or any of that???...HELL NO..She tells the guy who is preparing the food(Looked like the manager) that the order was wrong, you think he apologized???....HELL NO!...They didn't say one word to me, she started speaking in Spanish letting him know what was supposed to be in the bowl as though I wasn't standing right there! I'm on a 30min lunch so I don't have time for the foolery! Get back to work and my bowl wasn't even filled up. 2 stars because the taste of the food was Meh.... Not good, not bad, just food."}
{"text":"Came here on my lunch break and ordered two tacos to go. Similar set up to a Chipotle, where you go through an assembly line and customize your tacos, burritos, etc. Unlike Chipotle, Panchero's doesn't offer \"responsibly sourced\" ingredients and GMO-free options. A plus side to Panchero's is there was no line at 12:30pm on a Thursday... but that should be a warning sign that the restaurant is sub par. There were only two people eating lunch when I was there. 

As soon as I started driving away, I noticed wet spots on my passenger seat. The tacos were leaking through the tin foil, through the paper bag, and onto my seat! Ugh! Less than two minutes away from the restaurant, and it was a mess. Rather than drive back to the office, I pulled into a parking lot to eat my tacos. I didn't want to risk having them leak even more during the 7-minute drive back to work.

Even though I had just ordered the tacos five minutes earlier, the tortillas were soggy. I like the concept of cooking tortillas on the spot and having them freshly made with each order, but I cannot stand for soggy tortillas. I ordered one steak taco and one carnitas taco. The steak was very chewy and fatty - it was difficult to eat so I only had a few bites. The carnitas were tender but not very flavorful.

If I decide to try Panchero's again, I will definitely be eating in the restaurant rather than ordering take out. I don't even think they should offer \"to go\" as an option considering the mess the tacos made on my front seat and the fact that the tortillas get soggy after only a few minutes. I'm not sure if I'll be back - I'm not sure it's worth the risk when Chipotle is just a mile away."}
{"text":"One star for cleanliness. Actually too clean as in no people inside, but maybe it was just pass their dinner rush. Menu is pretty limited. It's like Subway of Mexican Food. A mediocre Chipotle. Choose what meat, toppings, sauces etc. I didn't mind that but when I got home the food tasted like those microwaved ones. Bland. Very disappointing. I'd take Taco Bell or Filiberto's any day over this restaurant. One star for friendly service. Idk how they'll improve their restaurant without revising their recipes. My search continuous for a new favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"The fresh made tortillas are awesome. Just the right amount of chewiness  They really distinguish themselves on those."}
{"text":"I was not all happy over priced spent close to $30.00 dollars on two burritos and two soft drinks my food was cold and looked like it was leftovers from the night before. service sucked very rude just rushed us through will never go 
Back will tell friend's! Zero stars"}
{"text":"Unbearably slow and not nearly as good as Chipotle.

The line in front of me today at the noon hour was ten deep and four of those people were placing orders for their office, so the ten I saw were equivalent to 30 orders."}
{"text":"This place is sort of like Qdoba, but it's more of a ripoff.

We ate there for lunch and I ordered a bag of chips and guacamole, and a side of queso. Well, instead of charging me 2.95 for the queso and chips and 1.00 for the guacamole, I was charged 2.95 and 2.25. For the extra .70 cents I would have had the extra chips.

Also, they don't tell you that nearly everything costs extra. I found it to be misleading and unhelpful; the four of us won't go back there again.

I'd suggest going to Chipotle or Qdoba."}
{"text":"This place beats chipotle any day!  Fresh pressed tortillas, amazing queso, fast and friendly service.  My wife and I will miss this place when we leave Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great service. The people are nice, but unfortunately the food is just not great. 

The food is boring and with Qdoba and Chipotle to compete with, up your game. The seasoning on the chicken did not stand out. It was all very bland. It was also very dry. I added salsa and sour cream but it just was not enough.

I ordered a burrito bowl with a tortilla. So same thing as a burrito, but they charged me an extra dollar for the tortilla. Blah."}
{"text":"This is really good place to go, I like their burrito bowl with fresh tortillas by side! Absolute fresh ingredients. Great for lunch as well, you just walk in and get food done couple minutes. Great place to go over and over. I won't be stingy to give them 5 stars considering the price, service and food they serve me!"}
{"text":"I looove this restaurant and location! The staff is always really really friendly and I always leave with a smile. My husband and I are vegan and we LOVE the tofusada burrito. I was always a little iffy about tofu becoming vegan, still am a little to be honest (texture and flavor need to be just right), and Pancheros nails it. You can't even tell you're eating tofu! And I like it better than Chipotle's version. The tortillas smell (like pancakes!!) and taste delicious, and it's overall really tasty. The chips are perhaps a little on the salty side, but otherwise it's all great. Thank you for being one of the few excellent options for vegan takeout in the area! 

*Make sure you download the app too if you're a frequent customer."}
{"text":"You just can't successfully imitate Chipotle. The food here is mediocre at best. The guac tastes like it was squeezed out of a bag. Definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"Decided to change it up from chipotle and give this spot a try. The idea of
Fresh tortillas caught my eye. There was no line like chipotle usually has. I ordered a chicken burrito with queso and pico. The chicken was a bit tuff, but tasty. I may return."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something different for dinner, so I headed on over to Pancheros to give them a try.

I knew I wanted a burrito, and I dig the fact that the tortilla is made right then and there, that's pretty sweet.

I went with the grilled steak, and I was going to toss some grilled veggies on there, but after looking into the pan and seeing dried up stuck to the side veggies I quickly changed my mind.  I went with the white rice, pinto beans, meat, cheese, salsa verde and sour cream, after everything was layered inside I thought they would wrap it up, but no they took a knife and mixed everything together, had I known they were going to do that I would have asked for the salsa & sour cream to be added later, I like the layering effect. Maybe I'm weird but I do.

Over all, I prefer Chipotle, I wanted to like this place, but it just didn't stack up.  The ingredients didn't look fresh, the white rice was supposed to be cilantro & lime but I can tell you there were no hints of green in the rice, and I happen to think cilantro is the best ingredient in the world but it was missing from my rice. The grilled veggies like I said where dried out and stuck to the pan, the meat was tough and cold. I just wasn't impressed over all."}
{"text":"The meat is still not hot enough but the tortillas are excellent, the man who prepared our food was attentive and pretty friendly and they washed their straw dispenser!   Getting a little bit better now.
I would like them to help me more in the selection of my meal.  They just sort of say, \"what else would you like?\"  What I would like is a great tasting burrito etc.    Just put on it what you would put on yours perhaps.  Is there more charge if I ask for more meat, cheese or sour cream?"}
{"text":"it's.. ¯\_(?)_/¯ I've now eaten here 3 times since the chipotle scare of 2015. The food is good, I get the bowl and tortilla on the side. The fresh made tortilla is  on point. I have to honestly share every time I come in, the employees look pissed off and missable. For example, today the woman who served me looked like if I asked another question she would cut me with the meat spatula that she used to flip my tortilla (good thing I'm not vegetarian).

The rice honestly sucks and most of the toppings are weak. The corn is good though. The meat this time was really dry.  I only eat here out of shear continence but every time I'm like \"why do I comeback?\" 

if you're in the mood for fast causal burrito/burrito bowl place drive the extra two miles and go to Chipotle on Green. If you want good tacos go to Maize."}
{"text":"I had Pancheros for lunch today and it tasted terrible.  Chipotle like restaurant but not even close in taste. I would have rather had Taco Bell rather than this garbage. The corn was like plastic and not even edible. I will not return!"}
{"text":"How does this place have four stars? We came in at 6:30 on a Friday night and it was empty except for one one table.  There were two girls working who were less them excited to help us or the gentleman waiting in front of us. I asked for a steak bowl and there was literally 4 little pieces of steak in the pan..I told her I really wanted Steak,  and she said they only had chicken or carnitas. We both said we really wanted steak,  the girl (Hispanic wears glasses) turned around grabbed 3 pieces of steak from a covered pan that was NOT hot cut it up and put it on my bowl. Lame!

My food tasted like microwave saltiness,  and my boyfriend got a steak burrito and said it was chewy, salty, and rubbery.

I give them one star for cleanliness,  and one star for having coke products. I wouldn't give this place a second try."}
{"text":"Bad Chipotle knock-off. I'm struggling to write this review without sounding whiny. There is very little redeeming about this place. One extra star for nice staff I guess. 

The lettuce here is gross. The chips are absurdly salty and I'm a salt guy normally! They upcharge for everything! Bland guac with stingy scoop size. Cold meats due to low turnover. Grilled veggies weren't even grilled. Pico de Gallo had mealy tomatoes. 

There is really no reason to go here. Chipotle is a million times better and has the added bonus of their whole sustainability shtick. Even if you work in the area, there's a Moe's literally a block away, just go there instead. 

I wouldn't return even with a coupon."}
{"text":"It's too bad that the owners and/or management don't have a better understanding of how to run a restaurant because the food is great here, but the service is way lacking. I've given this place a few chances at all different times of the day and every time I'm disappointed by the service. Today, the blond girl making tortillas was less than excited that I asked her for veggie tacos. She never looked up or said two words to me while making the tacos. Then threw the plate over to the next girl to top off with garnishes. The place, as usual, was dirty as well. It doesn't matter if they are busy or super slow, tables and common area are dirty and service is extremely slow. 

The food is great though. 

Thinking if the owners were more available and present or if they hired a present manager that wasn't 18 years old, this place would be run a lot better. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Panchero's Mexican Grill looked interesting to eat at, I love how they prepare their tortilla's in the big presser they have - but that's the only thing that impressed me; the tortilla's... Since they're freshly made, they're still yummy and \"gooey\" - The staff was really nice when we entered, and was attentive to what we wanted for our orders :)

I got a pretty basic burrito but was disappointed at the rice, the other two people in our party compared it to Uncle Ben's rice, the steak we got seemed \"boiled\", the medium salsa wasn't as spicy as I thought it was (but they do have a counter filled with different hot sauces; of course I grabbed the Tapatío), although the salsa was flavorful. My friends had ordered a chicken quesadilla - they were good but not great. It seemed they only had Montery Jack as their cheese. The prices were pretty decent, I think next time I will try something else though!"}
{"text":"This is a franchise similar to Qdoba, Chipotle, etc.  The thing which they use to differentiate themselves is that they make their tortillas from dough when you order and also \"bob\" it...which apparently means mixing the filling of the burrito when you order.

The good:  Each item is a set price. If you order a burrito it is the same price no matter what filling you choose. 

The bad: Flavor is not nearly as good as Qdoba or chipotle. I ordered a burrito with guac and carnitas.  In particular, I had an issue with the rice. It  basically tasted like butter & rice (a bit too oily too) and it overwhelmed everything.  The meat was not as flavorful as Qdoba/Chipotle as well.

Overall, I would pick Qdoba/Chipotle over Panchero's any day even though it costs about $2 more for the burrito I usually order there."}
{"text":"This is like 2 3/4 stars..

The food was good. I had a chicken burrito and the place reminded me alot of chipotle which I like.  In fact, I think the idea was kind of lifted from chipotle.  But the burrito was very good.  I of course love burritos so I am not that picky.  

I did not like the fact that they nickel and dimed you for extras.  I dont understand why places do that nowadays. If it matters that much raise the price 75 cents and say put anything you want in it.  If you have a bunch of choices and they are making the burrito in front of you and you are choosing all the options then nickel and diming is a good way to turn away alot of people.  Especially when you have Jersey Mikes the greatest sub chain in history right next door.

would go back but just because Im a sucker for burritos."}
{"text":"Great place with awesome service. I came in just to get water once in a big hug and they where very kind so I came back to eat. The chicken burrito was so good with the cheese sauce. Make sure you get the mix of sauces and tomatoes."}
{"text":"I moved here from Iowa, and yes Pancheros is huge there unlike Chipotle. I do agree the customer service isn't up to par but I still enjoy their homemade flower tortillas and their queso sauce. People are right on here that isn't much variety but I drive 35 min for a burrito from here than Chipotle. Im not saying I dont like Chipotle, it's just it wasnt popular in Iowa."}
{"text":"Prefer this place over the usual Chipotle. Taste's relatively the same as Chipotle, but a bit tastier. And the tortilla that they use is wonderful.
However, I strongly urge you to put the queso in the burrito. That's the game changer."}
{"text":"Delicious burritos best with queso worth the extra money. Chips and queso is great. Would suggest this place if you are looking for a bit of a different take on the burrito joint. Not to mention the way the make there tortillas is really fun and cool to watch."}
{"text":"Burrito bowl with rice, carnitas, queso, veggies, guacamole, sour cream, verde salsa. (most were adders) 
Food tasted great. 
With tea was over $12!
Didn't see lettuce as an option like Chipotle. Didn't seem as fresh either. 
Close to work, so I'll probably eat here again, but very pricey for what it is. However, hardly anyone was here, so I doubt it will be around in a year."}
{"text":"Es muy bueno. Preparan las tortillas al momento. Los sabores estan bien. La decoracion del lugar es muy americana, con pinturas de símbolos de la cultura mexicana. Lo único que no me gusto fueron las moscas volando, pero lo demas bien.

It is very good. Prepare the tortillas on the spot. The flavors are good. The decor of the place is very American, with pictures of symbols of Mexican culture. The only thing I did not like the flies were flying, but the rest well."}
{"text":"I give it one star for their customer service...

I went to this restaurant on their opening day after reading an article:

\"Pancheros Mexican Grill, a fast-casual Mexican restaurant, is opening Jan. 29 in Chandler, and they'll sell $1 burritos to mark the occasion.

Burritos will be available for a buck a week later, 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Feb. 5 at 2051 W. Chandler Blvd., Suite 1.\"

After being told to \"come back Feb. 5th\"  I showed the employee the article and she said no it was written wrong. I drove over 20 minutes to get here I told her and asked for the manager, she said he was busy...REALLY? Too busy to talk to an happy customer? 

I am not unreasonable after I left I can see their ad was poorly written and easily misunderstood. I would expect a manager to come out and speak with me and explain what happened in the least or act like they care about their customers. 

I don't like to give one stars but in the few cases that I have it is usually for bad service. I would have paid full price for their burrito, but after the way they handled the situation I have no choice."}
{"text":"My favorite fast/fresh mexican food!"}
{"text":"I always wished that Chipotle was open past 10pm and I almost got my wish in Panchero's Mexican Grill.  It is just like Chipotle.  They make burritos, bowls, tacos, salads, and quesadillas, just like Chipotle.  The cool thing about this place is that they make the tortilla's right in front of you.  They put a ball of dough in a tortilla press and right before your eyes, it turns into a tortilla.  They then toast it up on the griddle and you're ready to build your burrito/taco/bowl/salad/quesadilla. I went to a late movie last night at Tempe Marketplace and the other day when I was at Yogurtland I noticed that this place was about to open up and that it stayed open late so I had to try it.  I got a chicken burrito, my usual at Chipotle, and they did not disappoint!  The chicken was juicy, the rice was fluffy, and they only charge 0.95 cents for guacamole instead of 1.80 at Chipotle.  I am a huge Chipotle fan, and this place is open until midnight Sunday-Wednesday and open till 2am Thursday-Saturday so whenever I am craving a burrito late night and I don't want any of the 'bertos, I will be heading over to Panchero's Mexican Grill."}
{"text":"What I like:

1. Freshly made tortillas - what they're known for
2. That they mix up the ingredients inside the burrito before wrapping it
3. Their nice selection of hot sauces
4. Guac is cheaper (though they give less, so I guess it's the same)

Why I still prefer Chipotle:
1. Fresher ingredients
2. Tastes better still
3. Chipotle Tabasco sauce"}
{"text":"Positives first.  Guac is great.  Music was awful and way too loud.  I asked if they could please turn it down. To which they replied.  \"No.  But I'll check with manager \"Corporate office sets the volume level.  They didn't turn it down.   Second.  The apparent manager was rude and rushed.  Seemed irritated that we were there.  I will NEVER eat here again.  Chipotle is near by.  And food and vibe is 100 percent better !"}
{"text":"To me, this blows Chipotle out of the water. For one, you won't get sick. Boom. In all seriousness, this place is super good. I suggest getting the steak burrito. The tortillas are fresh and the meat is flavorful, unlike the \"other\" place where they get your tortillas out of a bag. A bag! 

Let's talk about cheese, baby. Let's talk about you and me! The cheese here is super good. It's like you're almost having a religious experience. Don't believe me? Go and try it for yourselves!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Always great food, consistent quality. I love it! It's more authentic than Chipotle because they have homemade tortillas and great mexican rice! 

If you want a good burrito, Panchero's is your place."}
{"text":"Like Chipotle but hate parking, traffic around the mall?  Here you go...good fast casual mexican food, great prices, and a convienent location."}
{"text":"Pancheros is 50 feet from my house so it's great from a convenience and laziness standpoint. I typically get their chicken quesadilla. It's tasty and gets the job done. Their tortillas are good, but I don't love the rest of the options on the menu. The tacos are alright but they only come two to an order...

When it's busy, it can be painfully slow. The service is friendly, but they usually only have two people working at a time so if there are more than 3 people ahead of you, expect to wait a while. 

It's so close and convenient that I'll continue to visit often and keep dominating their chicken quesadilla."}
{"text":"Meh, this place never really hits the spot. Every once and a while I try it thinking maybe last time was just a bad day... nope, probably will just stick to qdoba from now on. Their burritos are extremely expensive, especially with queso. 22 dollars for 2 burritos, chips with guac (that was brown) and 1 soda. Also our burritos were practically cold the second we bit into them. And there was NOBODY else in the restaurant so everything should be perfect. Not worth it. One good thing is the homemade tortillas."}
{"text":"Compared to Chipotle it doesn't hold a candle. There was no option of brown rice, only white rice. Also less topping options than Chipotle. Ordered chips and queso, cheese was a yellow-ish colored queso which I don't like and the chips were incredibly salty. Service was slow seeing how there were only 2 people ahead of me."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. Bland Chipotle wannabe with less toppings. They should offer more real Mexican food and not try to copy the brick shit manufacturer that is chipotle."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised my first visit here, I got chicken tacos and found them fresher tasting than Chipotle and less expensive. I came here again a couple weeks ago with my toddler and mother-in-law, who is allergic to onions. Almost everything at a place like this has at least onion powder...so I was worried if she could find something she could eat. I think the employee's name who helped us was Jesse R. He was very helpful and made a special burrito she could eat. Just a good experience to report! :)"}
{"text":"Out to lunch with co-workers the other day, we settled on Panchero's. Despite my deep love of Mexican food, this was my first time here. It's ok; it's a fast food tacos/burritos place. My carnitas burrito was huge, tasty, and very affordable. I got the hot sauce, which was unremarkable and not spicy at all. I'll add more hot sauce next time. Overall, the burrito was good, but not great. The interior of the restaurant was clean enough, as fast food restaurants are after the lunch hour. 

There were a few things that stood out though. The tortilla seemed unusually good and freshly warmed! I also appreciated how, after adding the ingredients but before wrapping the burrito, they stirred it all up, ensuring that all ingredients were evenly distributed throughout. And I liked, as you go down the counter, you're told how much extra each item will cost or if it's free. 

I'm sure I'll be back, fast and affordable lunch places are always in demand."}
{"text":"I don't get why everybody is dogging this place. They may not be quite as good as Chipotle which is the obvious and frequent comparison, but they do just fine in their own right. Solid quality food, solid value-for-money, friendly service, clean premises. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Another fast food Mexican joint in the spirit of Chipotle or Qdoba. But, Panchero's does have two things that definitely stand out. 

1. The fresh tortilla. 
It's pressed and cooked in front of you. And when you finally take a bite out of your burrito, you can really taste the difference. 

2. Mixing the ingredients. 
Unlike Chipotle, Panchero's does one extra step before folding your burrito. The rice, beans, meat, etc, all get mixed and you get a fairly equal amount in each bite. 

The problem. All those ingredients (other than the fresh tortilla) aren't quite as good as the other places. The price is about the same and they nickel and dime you for every extra, too.  I would never say no to Panchero's, I just wouldn't pick it over anywhere else."}
{"text":"First off, the food was fine.  Nothing I can't get at the other two made-to-order burrito places nearby, but good.  But in a world with so many burrito choices, I won't be going back to Pancheros.  The service was kind of slow but they did just open so we'll give them a pass.  They didn't have enough food prepared which forced us to wait while they made small quantities that they were bound to run out of again soon.  They said \"that's what happens when you cook fresh\".  I dunno, maybe I'm in the minority here but I don't really mind if my cooked veggies sit in a warming pan for a few hours.  

Another thing about the food-they are VERY skimpy on the scoops!  I've never noticed this at Chipotle or Q'doba, both of those places ladle it on like they're fattening you up for market.  But this place was seriously measuring out very scant scoops of rice, beans, cheese, everything.  I got a burrito bowl and it was...maybe half full.  And yet I paid the same price as my husband who got a burrito which has a tortilla that the bowl doesn't include.  What's up with that?

The parking here pretty much sucks if the place is at all busy and you enter through the Jimmy Johns drive-up lane so have fun maneuvering around the cars waiting in line.  The shared building with Jimmy Johns is just odd,  the signs for entering and exiting the parking lot only say Jimmy Johns, so it makes it seem like this place is a little tacked on.  Nope, won't be back."}
{"text":"Seems to be a lot of pretty brutal reviews on here, I honestly don't think it's that bad of a place.  I mean, it's fast food Mexican.  I've been here a number of times, and although I prefer Qdoba or Chipotle, this place really isn't that bad.  My wife, daughter, and I went again last night.  I had a chicken burrito, my wife had a chicken quesadilla, and my daughter had the Tot Quesadilla.

My burrito was hot and tasted good.  I thought it was a good size, no different than the previously mentioned alternatives.  I do like how they mix everything up before rolling up the burrito.  At the other places, it seems that you get splotches of ingredients as you make your way through the burrito.  I was also pretty excited that they had a tot quesadilla.  Essentially a small quesadilla for $2.25.  Worked perfect and my 2 year old loved it.

Don't go here expected gourmet, hit Qdoba or Chipotle if they are nearby.  But don't be afraid to try Panchero's the next time you're looking for a quick burrito."}
{"text":"No where close to chipotle. Threw half my veggie Burrito away. Perhaps meat stuff or salads are better. Not going back for sure."}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant, they skimped me and all my friends on our burritos..."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good. Love the fresh tortillas! Meat is seasoned well and the portions are just right. Interior is clean and sleek. My only (minor) complaint is that the salsa is a little too salty. But I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I got an offer for a free burrito upon signing up for their loyalty program. I go to Chipotle about  once per month and my first impression was that this place is trying to be like them. So, I can't help but compare to and reference Chipotle. The staff seemed a little dazed even though they weren't really busy. One girl appeared to be cutting chicken for the first time in her life, one guy was standing around the register, and the third guy was making tortillas. They do make their own which was pretty cool to see, but I'm not sure it made a difference in the end. Mine was a bit under cooked and gummy. The appearance of the assembly bar (or whatever it is) looked a little messy and a little stale compared to Chipotle's impeccably maintained station and super fresh ingredients. The guacamole was also turning brown. I opted for no beans and just a little bit of rice. The employee asked the guy behind me, \"how about you?\" which sounded a little rough. I ordered a steak burrito and the steak was quite well done and a small portion. I reviewed the \"extras\" board and asked for some veggies to round out my beanless burrito since they don't appear to charge for them. I like the idea of them mixing the ingredients but in practice it seemed a little barbaric and unnecessary. I get to the check out line and the veggies ended up costing an extra $1.00 which I had to put on a credit card because I was coming in for a \"free burrito.\" As far as condiments, I didn't try them. They were so picked over, mostly empty, and dirty that I didn't want to touch the bottles before eating the burrito with my hands. With the extra buck for veggies it ended up costing me the same as Chipotle for the same or lower qualify. I suggest going to Chipotle instead unless you really don't like Chipotle...but they are similar enough that you wouldn't like Pancheros if you don't like Chipotle."}
{"text":"The best aspect of Panchero's was the tortilla. It is in dough form and grilled right before your eyes on the tortilla press. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and it was among the best I have had anywhere. Fresh off the grill, they asked what salsa I wanted - I went with the medium and the corn - but unfortunately for a quesadilla, it is already grilled shut - so you either have to reopen it or eat it separately like a side dish. 

The owner was not only there when I visited, but he was working the grill, busing the tables and checking customer satisfaction. Big props for that! 

The only other thing I didn't like was the size of the tables. There were two of us for lunch and the tables were really small. It felt crowded and I didn't like that - but the food and the service was excellent. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"NOT YOUR AUTHENTIC MEXICAN BURRITO :(

POSITIVES
-Hefty portions
-Tortillas made fresh in front of you

AREA FOR IMPROVEMENT
-Rice - a white herbal rice, would really prefer traditional Spanish rice
-Overpriced - almost $10 for a basic bean & cheese burrito w/guac
-They don't know how to roll a burrito & it falls apart
-The tortilla being so thin sticks to the wrapper & falls apart
-Leaky burrito - tortilla too thin & not wrapped tightly
-They do this weird mixing up your filling thing that makes it look like vomit
-No cilantro (!!!?)
-No lettuce
-Flavor is very non-Mexican food, very Americanized"}
{"text":"Amazing homemade tortillas makes the burritos delectable."}
{"text":"Visiting on business, I wanted something quick on a Sunday night and saw this listed under Mexican food.  The minute I walked in, I could tell that, instead of being an actual Mexican restaurant, it was simply a cheap knock-off of Chipotle (which is not really Mexican either lol). I was hungry, however, so I tried a steak quesadilla.  Average at best.  I'll give it two stars simply because it was around $5 plus a drink.  I'll stick to the real Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"I am not sure what the other reviewers ordered but for a quick burrito it's a pretty good place. The Queso is very good (necessary sometimes as the meat can be a little bland). However that being said I find the chicken and carnitas to be better than Chipotle or Moe's. The two major positives of Panchero's is that they fresh make your tortilla in front of you, and they use little mixing utensils to combine all the contents of your burrito. Each bite has everything compared to Chipotle where one side is rice and toppings and the other is Meat. Overall a pretty good place for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Great and fast service very enjoyable and good alternative down side is that they don't have brown"}
{"text":"As a newly-opened establishment, Panchero's is still trying to find its groove.  Plenty of staff were manning the counters during a recent visit with my boyfriend, so our food was prepared in a timely fashion.  However, 2 different employees made our burritos, and I'd say that there was some inconsistency in technique: his was flat and floppy, mine was stout and compact.  I see the same differences at other made-to-order places (like Subway), so that might not be a fair criticism.

In terms of complaints from other Yelpers about time and efficiency, I admit that Chipotle edges out Panchero's, but the additional minute or two required to put together a burrito didn't seem unreasonable.  The time delay might be more problematic during meal crunch times; not sure that Chipotle is much better considering their lines of 20+ students when school is in session.

I can't complain about food quality, especially for fast food.  Tortillas are pressed and cooked at the time of your order, which is kind of fun to watch.  I think their rice differs from the lime-cilantro recipe, but I couldn't discern any specific flavor, either.  The grilled meats and veggies are tasty, and you are offered your choice of standard toppings: pico de gallo, corn salsa, tomato salsa, sour cream, guacamole, etc.  When I requested a little more rice or salsa, employees loaded up my burrito without complaint or extra charges.   Before wrapping up your burrito, they use small spatulas to mix together ingredients so that each bite is a \"perfect\" mix of everything.

For local folk who don't have the patience for the student crowds in campustown, Panchero's is a fine alternative to Chipotle.  Prices, food quality, and environment are comparable.  Their fresh-made tortillas are a nice touch, but I'm not sure they make much of a difference in terms of flavor."}
{"text":"To put it quite simply this place is dirty and not well maintained or staffed. Employees look like they just got through mowing the lawn or rifling through piles of garbage. Even the soda machine is in desperate need of some serious cleaning. 

Either management doesn't care or is blind."}
{"text":"Lured in today by the $1 burrito special with Smart Shopper Card. The staff was very friendly, the place was clean, and the food was good. I'm not sure who copied who (Panchero's or Chipotle) but for Americanized, corporate Burritos, this place is faaaaaaaaaaaarr better than Chipotle, and I like their hours."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great service and fresh food. Beat tortillas ever!!#"}
{"text":"I've never been to the existing location in Urbana, so my only experiences have been with this new location.  Entering the parking lot can be an interesting experience sometimes because cars leaving the lot have vision blocked on the left, and the Starbucks drive-thru is immediately inside the parking entrance.

I think the food is pretty decent quality.  The burritos taste very fresh, you get a good amount of fillings (choice of meat, choice of beans, rice, shredded cheese, choice of salsa type).  While some people don't like it, I like the fact that they chop up the ingredients a bit before closing the burrito.  The obvious competitors for this business are Moe's, Chipotle, and Cactus Grill, and sometimes in those burritos you get pockets of only rice or only beans. 

The downside of Pancheros is that both queso and guacamole are upcharges ($1) to get them in the burrito.  I've had several burritos from Pancheros without queso in the burrito, and they are MUCH better if you get at least queso in them.

If you compare them to their direct competitors, they have similar pricing, but the fact that EVERYTHING is an additional charge is disappointing.  Cactus Grill and Chipotle both charge for guac and don't even have queso, so Pancheros is up one on them.   However, Moe's doesn't charge for guacamole and has better selection to choose from on ingredients and salsas, which is a big plus in my book.  

I haven't eaten in the restaurant, but every time I'm there the people behind the counter are friendly and the space looks pretty clean.

Overall, I like it and will likely continue to go there."}
{"text":"Ingredients are fresh and tasty, and the staff are fast and friendly. Try the pico and mild salsa combo on your burrito or tacos! Tortillas are made fresh and taste like it. My wife and I keep coming back for more. Negative reviews? Completely baffling."}
{"text":"So, I dig this place. The burrito meats were freshly cooked, not dried-out, and not overcooked. The queso was a delicious addition, but I'm sad that it was a $1 extra. Sure, the fresh tortilla is great, but I'm far more impressed by \"the mixer.\" Once they put all of the ingredients on the tortilla, they mix it all up with a little spatula so that every bite is uniform. I gotta say, this is genius. I don't like burritos many times, because you get whole bites of one thing or another. This is a brilliant extra. Can you other burrito places do this too?"}
{"text":"Two stars only because the food is great and that's the only reason I continue to return.  Management or owners a few of your staff members are unprofessional and should not be working at a place were direct customer  interaction is required.  I think this may have been my last visit."}
{"text":"Yuck! Do yourself a favor and go out of your way to find a Chipotle or Qdoba, they are SOOOOO much better. Chicken looked processed and was cold, the veggies were mushy and the rice they use sucks. Stay away."}
{"text":"Thought it was a really good burrito. Great chips and salsa. Compares favorably to chipotle in this area."}
{"text":"I work close by and have stopped in a couple times to get food to go. I personally like the food here better than qudoba or chipotle. The rice is nice and spiced and the beans an chicken are always great. Portion sizes are hue and the fresh tortillas are awesome."}
{"text":"Ashley H is drunk or owns stock in this chain. No offense Ashley, but you said: \" The thing which they use to differentiate themselves is that they make their tortillas from dough when you order and also \"bob\" it...which apparently means mixing the filling of the burrito when you order.\"

They do neither, at least not with me. They threw a tortilla on the warming plate, then just filled it with the same boring bland choices I get at Qdoba and Chipotle. The end result, the same awful, bland, boring shit.

Now there are three places, exactly the same and turning out the same poor quality of food."}
{"text":"Honestly, the burritos here are delicious, which is why I almost feel bad giving them only 3 stars. However, the service here is atrocious and in the 2 or so years I've been going here, it hasn't gotten any better.

They recently changed their hours and close three and a half hours earlier than they used to. However, they haven't updated the hours on their website and the other day when I pulled up after closing, the \"Open\" sign was still lit and the doors unlocked. After standing in the deserted lobby for a few seconds, an employee finally poked his head from around the corner and told me they were closed.

Some of the staff are friendly, but then others have an attitude that makes you think you're doing them a major inconvenience by walking through their doors. I get that it's a fast-casual style restaurant, but customer service is still an important tenet.

Finally, they consistently don't have certain items ready. I've come in during different times (lunch rush, afternoon, evening) on different days, and it seems like they're almost always out of something major like chicken, beans, or rice.

Again, the food here is delicious, but I have an internal struggle every time I crave Pancheros to decide if the food is worth the terrible service."}
{"text":"What makes Pancheros a unique burrito building and rice bowl consuming experience? A few things.
Mostly the tortilla. Its better than chipotle and qdoba. They make it out of a tiiiiiiiny ball of dough. Just for you. Right there. And its a real difference.

Second, they mix the burritos. Its a veritable marble slab of latin mixins. That provides a consistent burrito experience.

Third, they dont smile at you. They take their burritos seriously. Apparently Very Seriously. Ive met at least four employees at various times at this location. They are always calm, prpfessional and quick. They are not friendly. 
Other better than's: corn salsa. Queso (costs more).

Things they dont do as well-
I mentioned smiling. Just dont expect it. Bring friends to fill that void.
The chicken is fine but not Chipotle. The rice is meh.
All in all its a solid experience for the money."}
{"text":"Great service. Love the carnita tacos. They give you plenty of salsa to go with the chips. I hate running out of salsa. It just as advertised and plenty hot. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I have to compare Panchero's to Chipotle because that's exactly what it is in almost every aspect.

I ordered a steak burrito and loaded it up with just about everything that didn't cost extra.

After it was said and done, I had a $7 burrito that wasn't bad, but was lacking in a couple areas. I don't think the portion size is as large as chipotle, and I also think the meat quality isn't as good either, but it was hard to tell as my burrito had a lot of rice. I did like how they mixed everything up before rolling, I feel that sometimes the ingredients are too segregated. Veggies are also extra whereas at Chipotle I do not believe they are. 

Panchero's might have a better quesadilla than chipotle, though. It was interesting to see how they quickly they heat it up like that!

I was also a fan of the salsa verde, as well as the free sauce they have on the condiment table, surprisingly spicy and good.

Overall I liked it but still think Chipotle might be better. I didn't know this was a chain until I looked it up, but it is. I was also given a punch card where when I buy 10 entrees I can get a free one. This might be useful if it was in a better location, at least for students!

3/5 just OK but still way better than most fast/junk food garbage."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I'm def coming here instead of chipotle. Food is more authentic, service is kind, and serving size is quite generous for cost."}
{"text":"I think Panchero's is still a solid 3-star place, but in general I've noticed that the staff are more upbeat and pleasant to interact with since my last review.  I don't really feel like the burritos I get are super consistent--sometimes it's really really good, sometimes it just seems off.  Not sure why.  I got a chicken burrito the other day with my usual hot tomatillo salsa and for some reason it was ungodly spicy (which it's never been before) and my esophagus was burning the rest of the night.  Yikes.  Not sure what changed, but I've never had that experience and I pretty much order the same thing every time."}
{"text":"THE BAD: The workers were loudly talking about \"this girl who wanted to show how nasty she could get;\" there wasn't any other patrons (7pm on Friday) which isn't a good sign; and no whole wheat tortilla. 

THE GOOD: the taste was decent but it could have used cilantro; it was fast since no one else was there; I was able to customize my order (half serving of rice/beans). 

HOW TO FIX: be more mindful of your employees actions and offer a whole wheat tortilla. if those two happened I would give this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"I have driven by several times so I decided to finally try it. I will say they have very good queso and the tortillas are very good. However, they weren't busy at all and the staff seemed annoyed both with each other and with me for 'disturbing' them with my order. Also, I ordered a chicken quesadilla and even commented is that it? Because they gave 7.. Yes literally 7... Small pieces of chicken."}
{"text":"The queso and tortillas are really the only things I like about This place. We can compare it to chipotle since it's basically the exact same thing. Fresh tortillas are excellent when they aren't undercooked, which mine was today. I ordered the steak burrito bowl with a tortilla on the side. I got two tiny scoops of meat. I also ordered the chips and queso this visit. I asked for an extra scoop of shredded cheese and was told it would be $.50 extra. Chipotle doesn't charge and their cheese is better! When I challenged her and asked, \"so its 50 cents extra for a tiny scoop of cheese?\" She says, \"sorry it's a business...\"  whatever that means! I also asked for extra sour cream-again it's an extra charge. Chipotle will add as much cheese and sour cream as I like!! My total was $11- no drink. I'll go to chipotle next time I'm craving chipotle. This Panchero's just can't compete."}
{"text":"Outrageously good!!!!! I'm not going to say that its 5 star dining or anything but for the type of restaurant this is to me it gets 5 stars. I'm a big advocate of Chipotle and Panchero's kind of one up's them on every level, plus when you add queso like that to a burrito #BOOMSHAKALAKA it takes the burrito game up to a whole notha LEVEL!!!!! Another great factor is it's cheap and they always have some kind of deal going. Perfect meal for lunch or even a way better alternative for a family that wants to eat fast but doesn't want to have to get junk from a drive thru. I'm kind of a snob when it comes to ingredients and Panchero's does a good job to take care of their food so you can trust it. #THUMBSUP #HIGHFIVES all around and #GOODGAME Panchero's"}
{"text":"Panchero's shares a similar concept to Qdoba and Chipotle: your burritos are crafted right in front of you to your liking. What separates Panchero's from it's competition is the value. For around six bucks you'll get a generously sized burrito. Sides and drinks are also noticeably less expensive than it's competitors.

The food is also quite good. I wasn't blown away by it, but was overall quite satisfied. The highlight of my meal was the wrapping of the burrito. Your burrito will be sealed neat and tight, so you won't have to worry about soggy beans dripping over your plate.

Panchero's is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Chipotle, Qdoba and Rubios are 10x better.  I felt it had no flavor.  Nice place, clean.  But the food was blah.  My steak was awful.  It looked ilke pork and am still not convinced that it was steak.  i regretted going there instead of jersey mike's next door  :(  sometimes you learn the hard way."}
{"text":"Affordable and fulfills the quick fix for Mexican food if you're in a jam. One interesting bit is they mix all your burrito ingredients with a paddle before wrapping in the tortilla but the downside is your burrito filling cools down a little before you get to enjoy."}
{"text":"Meh. Really, no more than meh. Loosely wrapped burrito, mediocre ingredients. The \"mix it before we wrap it\" gimmick is silly and doesn't add anything. 
Sorry, kind of harsh. But I take my burritos seriously."}
{"text":"Very good burritos, love the fresh tortillas. Fair price, I like to get double meat, chicken of course!"}
{"text":"Okay. Not Cafe Rio. Not Costa Vida."}
{"text":"I'd give it a 3.5.  It's better than Cactus Grill but not quite Chipotle.  The Queso was great.  Service was ok.  Everything was new and nice.  Chicken portion was small."}
{"text":"The people who work there at 12:30p.m are the most rude inconsiderate people ever. I used to love this place, but even the manager had a terrible attitude. For the past several years I recommended this place, but now I will tell people to not go there. I brought a girl there that had never been there and all the lady could say \"you want the same?\" Absolutely ridiculous!!! Terrible customer service! Never again!"}
{"text":"OK, this place is all about the burrito and you can't go wrong. Can you say fresh! 

Came here for lunch on a Saturday, I was the only person there, I can't believe it. This is a hidden gem that simply may not be getting the exposure it deserves. 

Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Panchero's!!! They're franchising now??? I lived on this in Iowa City back in the early 90's when I was in law school. How cool that they (and Jimmy John's!) are now national from such humble beginnings.

Their freshly pressed, hot, toasted, chewy tortilla is their trademark (plus the mixing of the ingredients with a special spoon, but that's a bit gimmicky). Either you love their tortilla or you don't. I love it a lot! But it's not your standard tortilla out of the plastic bag, so to each his own. Other than that, it's the usual Chipotle/Qdoba-type fresh ingredients (which are awesome).

I wish you guys would bring back the grilled chorizo option from 20 (!) years ago in Iowa City  and start cutting the carne asada directly from a rotisserie again (also from back in the day). Another way to distinguish yourself from the other burrito places...

Go Hawks!"}
{"text":"This is the best place you will ever eat. When I went to ASU I ate here maybe 3x per week... The soft tortillas.. The queso! The way they mix everything together. It is depressing that they don't exist in California.. I love it so much I have looked into opening my own franchise.. Pancheros over chipotle anyday #pancherosforever"}
{"text":"The burrito we had was a good size  (we split one for lunch)  for the money but would have preferred that it was a lot hotter, and as others have said, not very flavorfull.  Also had the queso & chips,  purple corn chips were very good but the queso was runny and not much flavor."}
{"text":"Wow - loved the Carnitas - so tender, flavorful, and not greasy.  And it's so cool that they offer queso and make fresh tortillas - I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Everything just taste either meh or bad. They really need to put a gosh darn chipotle in the area"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time tonight with my boyfriend, he's been here before but it was my first time. There was no line so we didn't have to wait at all which was nice, we both got bowls and I had him order first so I could figure out what I wanted. I thought it was nice they give you tortillas with your meal which I'm pretty sure are for free. I asked if I didn't get meat if the guacamole was free in replace of that, she said no. I don't eat meat so then I asked if they had their tofu, she also said no. I'm mainly giving this place 3 stars because of the somewhat rude customer service I was given, was not greeted upon arriving and I would really appreciate it if they gave guacamole for free instead of getting meat. I think vegetarians/vegans definitely would appreciate this. Because they were out of the tofu she should have offered the guac for free to me, I even told her I was vegetarian and she just stared at me and waited for me to say something. Next time I'm probably going to chipotle since guacamole is free if you don't get meat there. I don't really feel the need to be charged for guac just because I don't eat meat. The food overall was somewhat good, my rice was not cooked all the way though because I did have hard pieces of rice in my bowl."}
{"text":"I nearly died here.  Seriously.  Only my robust gut bacteria saved me.

Never particularly liked Panchero's: yes, it  seems to have the exact same stuff as Chipotle/Qdoba, but the items are cheaper.  Unfortunately the quality of food seems to be cheaper as well (rice, meats)

Ordered the pork. BIG MISTAKE.  With each bite, the pork tasted more and more strange...like canned tuna!  And then I gave some to my dining companion, after 1 bite he didn't taste anything but on the 3rd bite, yes, confirmed that it tasted like fish!

I did not get sick after eating it, which surprised me. But if I must go back in the future, I think I'll stick to guac and chips."}
{"text":"Similar to chipotle, but more expensive. I like it better than chipotle though. I recommend the burrito. The tortillas are made fresh, and are amazing! I also recommend getting the queso. It is overpriced, but it makes the burrito. I love that they mix all the ingredients together before wrapping the burrito so every bite has a little of everything in it. I have tried the chicken and steak, and both are good. The steak is a bit spicy, but I enjoy it. I should also mention I'm a wimp with spicy foods."}
{"text":"Panchero's is a low quality version of Chipotle, but with similar prices. The burritos are also smaller than Chipotle's. 
The employees are friendly, but I don't like their food. The meat is often overcooked, the rice is mushy, the beans are dry. The guacamole is bland and not worth the extra cost. The queso is slimy and generic. Overall, there is nothing worthwhile about the food. The only time I eat it is when it is getting late and I need to grab something quick, because there is a Panchero's right near my house and they are open until 11pm. It is only ever a choice I make out of convenience."}
{"text":"I love the fresh pressed tortillas at Panchero's!  No more dry, flour-y tortillas for this gal and I love the variety of menu items they have.  I hate to use the C-Word (cough, cough, Chipotle) but that place doesn't compare to the delicious flavors and fresh, chewy tortillas at Panchero's.

Another amazing menu item at Panchero's is their queso dip, I highly recommend adding it to your burrito, it is worth the up charge.  Unlike that C-Word place, this fresh mex place has quesadillas on the menu which is my other go to purchase."}
{"text":"After a long day of work, the Burrito Fairies had come to me and sprinkled their magic dust on my nose.  I needed a burrito.  

My usual burrito place is Burrachos in Sun Prairie, but that was a 30 minute drive.  Where could I hook up a burrito in the vicinity of my place of employment?  Pancheros.

I had never been to a Pancheros, but I'm going back.  They make the tortilla fresh--point to them.  The fillings weren't quite as voluminous as Burrachos, but they take this magic spatula and mix the ingredients together so you get a burrito the way it was intended:  A bite of everything in every bite.  

I got home that night and I told my wife, \"You know...I just ate a burrito like an hour ago, but if there was a Pancheros in Sun Prairie, I'd go get another one.\"  

And I would have. I'm definitely going back as soon as I can.  Perhaps today for lunch."}
{"text":"All Panchero's are not the same, this location proves that. Ordered my old standby (which has been good to me at the Madison locations) a bean, rice and cheese burrito with pico and hot salsa and it was barely warm. Are you not reading your reviews owner? Seems like this temperature issue has been going on for a while. The rice was bland and watery as well. Don't think I'll be going back to this location unless I read multiple reviews that show improvement. For now I'll go the distance into Madison where they know more about flavor and how to heat their food."}
{"text":"Sometimes in life you face a decision. Should I take a risk and get my burrito here? Or should I drive the extra mile to chipotle?
Today I made the wrong one. This place maked Qdoba look like fine dining. I got a burrito with rice, black beans, carnitas, sour cream, guac, and pico. It was bland! The beans were just beans. The guac was untraceable. All of this could have been redeemed with some cholula or tapatio. 
But alas, there are only two ranchero-made hot sauces available. Hotsauce tyranny. Greenade and flavorcano. Greenade tastes like that stuff they bring you at bad mexican restaurants to dip your cold tortilla chips in. The latter tastes like f*cked up barbeque sauce.
I wish I could say I saved a buck by forgoing qdoba or chipotle, but I did not. I shall never return to Ranchero's Mexican Grill."}
{"text":"I got a burrito, finished the entire thing, and am now sad about being burrito-less. Wow yum thanks"}
{"text":"Restaurant review
This place is flat out a poor version of Chiptole. I thought I had written a review previously or it was deleted, but I came here a few times for work lunch without any major issues, however about 1/2 a year ago while they were making my burrito, I asked for more cheese. The manager or whoever had the audacity to tell me \"no that is all the cheese you get for a burrito\". I was rather shocked as chiptole you can ask for as much of any toppings as you want. That little ice cream scooper is maybe 1 oz of cheese. After that I vowed not go here again. Well I should have stuck to my guns as it is snowing outside and I wanted a burrito. I went in and all went well until we go to the cheese again. They again gave me a super small amount of cheese and I asked for more which meant one more scoop. I didn't even see but for that one scoop they charged me an extra 50 cents. No where on the menu do they indicate they will charge you more for the toppings on your burrito. Also for 50 cents I am not sure how much that works out to be in price per lb for the cheese you are serving... The steak was actually cold and very hard as well. The only plus is the fresh tortilla skin. With that I am making a vow not to come back. If you want to advertise yourself as making custom burritos, don't nickle and dime people. How much are you going to charge me if I ask for more corn salsa....

Pros: fast burrito service

Cons: Small burritos, 50 cents for a small scoop of cheese come on man!

Hidden deals:
None, be careful as they seem to upcharge you for everything. Queso on your burrito I can understand, but shredded cheese....

{"text":"While frequently going to Yogurtland, I've always eyed this place, wanting to try it out.  My time finally came!

I had stopped by at Panchero's after getting some Yogurtland the other day [yes yes, dessert before dinner  XD].  I had ordered the chicken quesadilla and it wasn't too bad.  I liked how they make the tortillas fresh!  It's not exactly the best I've had but it's okay for an Americanized-Mexican food place."}
{"text":"It was an okay burrito. It's a chain of course, but i prefer Chipotle's burritos over this one. Nice fresh made tortillas though! Obviously not authentic Mexican, but nice to have more than burgers and fries on a menu."}
{"text":"Pros: 1) Excellent, fresh tortillas. This is reason enough to go here over the chains that give you a pre-pressed tortilla out of a plastic bag. 2) The taste is great, the food is usually very fresh. 3) The price is a bit cheaper than Chipotle. 4) You don't have to worry about the massive lines at Chipotle.

Cons: The employees are awful. They clearly hate their jobs and are generally grumpy when you interact with them.

I highly recommend Panchero's. The employees are pretty terrible, but the food is outstanding, especially the fresh tortillas, which makes all the difference."}
{"text":"pros: fresh pressed-before-your-eyes tortillas, queso dip, basic variety

cons: repeated my order at least 6 times to the same guy, asked to go light on the rice and got 2 heaping spoon fulls, and ended up costing more than chipotle.

may or may not return. not really sold on the benefits."}
{"text":"Went there once with my friend, I ought when they opened. I got a steak and rice bowl with salsa on top. My friend got quesadillas, she said they were good. But my Steak and rice was cold, but I was good just cold. And over priced. I work at a food business and seeing the guest service employee on her phone made me laugh. Nice, clean place, average food."}
{"text":"Just had my first burrito. PHENOMENAL. Might just be better than Chipotle. Legions better than qdoba, clearly."}
{"text":"It's alright. So far I've tried a chicken burrito and chicken bowl and I haven't really found either to be that special. The portion for the bowl also significantly smaller than other comparable places (ahem... Chipotle). Also I just feel like the ingredients aren't as flavorful. It's all kind of a bummer because the location is pretty convenient."}
