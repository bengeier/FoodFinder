{"text":"Since we were staying at a Hotel so close to Le Quartier Chinois which seemed to have quite a few Vietnamese restaurants I was looking forward to scoring some decent Pho before the trip was over.  When we did finally go out we realized that ALL Vietnamese restaurants in the area close at 9pm as opposed to Chinese places which stay open till 2 or 3 AM.  Why is that anyway? So we felt rushed to find a place quickly.  We chose Pho Cali thinking it looked competent and clean.  As we sat down we encountered the dreaded Surly Waiter.  Apparently someone whizzed in this guys cornflakes today and he was taking it out on us! He thrust the menus at us without a word with a thoroughly disgusted look on his face.  My husband nicely asked if he spoke English. He replied sarcastically \"No, Spanish\". Imagine his surprise when hubby proceeded to order our entire meal in Spanish.  Suddenly pissed off waiter boy spoke English!  The rest of the meal was a constant parry of attitude and sarcasm.  What school of serving did this guy attend?  I didn't check Yelp before going to this purveyor of fine Vietnamese cuisine so I guess I had it coming.  Our experience pretty much paralleled other Yelpers regarding paying the bill.  He added it up then when we tried to pay with American dollars padded the bill due to the exchange rate.  Would not accept our credit card either.  We payed cash and left this fine example of waitstaff one shiny Canadian dollar for the privilege of having him serve us and left.  Suddenly Nasty waiter follows us out to the street and proceeds to pull an indignant Justin Long tirade from \"Waiting\"!!! Oh, HELL NO!  He says \"here sir you left your money on the table\". In perfect English no less!  I said before he could go any further\" oh no you earned every penny of that with your fine attitude\" he got all \"Guppy\" on me opening and closing his mouth and nothing coming out.  So aside from the terrible service the Pho was decent, the limeade tangy and tasty and the rolls we had were excellent.  Not good enough to justify putting up with such nasty waitstaff. There must be much better Vietnamese places around.  I would avoid this one.  Just sayin...."}
{"text":"Very good pho.  Excellent pork chops w large portion of flavorful meat for only $9.  Polite attentive service.  We thoroughly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The pork chop we ordered as a side dish was excellent. The shrimp spring rolls were fine, although I have had better. The house special pho came in a generous huge portion (we ordered extra large), but this is as far as I will compliment this dish. The pho broth was not as fresh as expected; it had the feel of coming from a soup base or cube, but not authentically brewed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Montreal. Delicious subtle broth, great spring and fried rolls, cheap, good fast service. Highly recommended if you're in the area and want a quick, delicious meal."}
{"text":"You call it Pho Cali, I call it \"PRICE GOUGING!!\"  Store front that looks like a front load washer, and I left feeling like I was \"TAKEN TO THE CLEANERS\".  Not only did they insult us by adding a tip on our check, nasty lady refused  to accept credit cards, slapped our US dollars around like rags and demanded an additional 20%. Meat tasted like damp cardboard; tasteless, like it was sitting in a pot of water all day. Beige tables and black chairs décor reminded me of a school cafeteria. Experience left me NAUSEATED, BULLIED and CHEATED...This put a dampener on my trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Pho is average and the staff are jerks. Avoid this place like the plague and head a few doors to to Pho Bang New York. There's a reason why this place is empty and Pho Bang is full!"}
{"text":"Best pho on a cold autumn day!  As a pescatarian, I've always found the seafood pho a bit tasteless in all these pho places in Chinatown, but cali pho had certainly surprised me!  We shared an extra large grilled shrimp pho, and as soon as it arrived at the table, I could smell the heavenly aroma! After adding in the bean sprouts and basil, the hot soup just tasted so flavourful, and the shrimps are so crunchy and aromatic. The experience was just simply wonderful!"}
{"text":"Good pho broth and very good grilled pork with salad..im glad we ate there. For 3 people, we have extra large beef bro pho, grilled pork and rice, fresh spring roll and 1 crushed ice bean dessert; came up to $29.25 tax and tip included. A must in the area if u want to stay away from tourist trap port Montreal area."}
{"text":"I got the spicy noodle soup and it was surprisingly good. I haven't been to many pho places in Montreal but the soup definitely compares well to the ones in Toronto. We came here as we had a craving for pho. you will get some authentic Vietnamese food here as its run by Vietnamese!!  Give it a shot if you're in the area and craving some pho!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for 7 years.   The BEST pho in town, the bouillon is so delicious. They have upgraded their prices, but with the rise of the prices of life its normal. When i came here 7 years ago the small pho soup was 6.25$ now its 7.00$. still the best price i have found overall.   I always take the soup number 2.  Ingredients are fresh and high quality.   Staff always friendly and funny."}
{"text":"After a morning hike I came here for lunch, ordered a spring roll and a small house beef noodle.  I liked the soup base but it wasn't hot enough to quickly heat up the raw pieces of beef; otherwise there were a variety of beef ball, beef slices, onion, cow collagen etc in the small portion.  Except the warm soup base being not hot enough, it is a good meal."}
{"text":"Awesome, we always go here when we visit Montreal.  Pho, fresh rolls, deep fried rolls are mainly what we order.  Service is on par with the other Vietnamese restaurants we visit."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst restaurant that i have ever been to.  I had much better tasting pho compared to this.  The service was horrible; no manners what so ever.  Even fast food places have better costumer services. Once they find out that you're from a foreign country their service became worst.  I would never go back to this restaurant even if i get paid to."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed was the server. He looked like he hated his job.   Then for the food, it came in 2 minutes, it was so quick! But when I started to eat it, I was disappointed. The soup wasn't really tasty and there was just a bit of meat that seemed dry and wasn't really good.  Not ever returning there again!"}
{"text":"Just very average pho, with crappy service during lunchtime, mainly because there are lots of people during that time.  I would probably hire more waiters if I were the owner..."}
{"text":"The pho seemed fresh and was well made with a light but flavourful soup. The meat was delicious, soft, the noodles were soft, the tendons were soft and not at all rubbery.  The reason why it is not getting higher marks is for 2 reasons:  1. Portion size for the price. I hate to compare this place to Toronto, but for what I paid (around $7) I should have gotten twice the meat and twice the noodles.  2. The broth could have had more spices and have been more flavourful.  Otherwise, the service was nice and the food came out very fast."}
{"text":"While the pho was tasty and service was fast, the staff here needs to learn some manners. When it was time to pay up, they saw American funds, scowled and tried to make up their own favorable conversion rates. Their ATM machine do not work with foreign cards either.  I had to walk up to Sherbrooke to the closest bank and withdraw money to avoid getting robbed. I should have went to the Vietnamese restaurant next door.  IFHTP 1"}
{"text":"Le personnel est toujours souriant et gentil! C'est l'endroit idéal pour se réchauffer, lorsque c'est l'hiver! La soupe pho au poulet grillé est la meilleure que j'ai jamais mangé jusqu'à maintenant! Les prix ne sont pas chers pour la quantité et la qualité des repas! Il y a seulement 1$ de différence entre les tailles de soupes! N'oubliez pas de rajouter de la sauce hoisin et de la lime dans votre Phô! :)"}
{"text":"The meat is less fatty than at other Pho restaurants, and I appreciate that - basically why I prefer Cali over NY next door. The waiters are friendly and the service is quick."}
{"text":"One day, when Pho Bang New York was too packed, I decided to try Pho Cali just next door and I was pleasantly surprised. For a while, Pho Cali became my spot, especially since I worked only two metro stations away and was often at the Palais des congrès for work. I definitely think their broth is better than PBNY's and would choose their pho any day. However, I can't praise their grilled meat meals, as I think they lack in flavor.   For my full MTL Pho Hunt review and more photos, check out my blog: Turquoise Blog (link in bio!)"}
{"text":"I absolutely agree with Peter K's review. Don't let the bright welcoming decor fool you into walking in here. We ordered the spring rolls which turned out to be non traditional  Vietnamese spring rolls filled with cabbage and carrots. It reminded me of Westernized spring rolls that can be bought frozen at the grocery store. The pho was decent, but the broth was watered down and not as concentrated as other Vietnamese restaurants. The Vietnamese iced coffee was also served in a non traditional way-- already premixed in the back in a tall glass of ice. Not to be picky, but I do enjoy my hot drip espresso with condensed milk on the bottom of the cup, and pouring  the coffee into the ice myself.  When it came time to pay, they don't accept credit cards. Perhaps that  should've been stated on the door or on the menu? We payed with  American currency and they decided to make up their own exchange rate  and over charged us by 20%, stating \"We are not a bank [so we don't  know what the current exchange rate is]\"nIf you are going to over  charge tourists, at least serve proper Vietnamese food and not  \"reinvented\" Vietnamese food. \"C'est bon!\" I think NOT!"}
{"text":"Cold day, 1400 hrs, needed hot lunch.  Bowl of pho made sense.  Walked in, was struck by the cleanliness of the place.  Got a seat at the counter along the window without any trouble- place was only half full.  Menu and teapot arrived quickly.  Compared to other places I've been to, Pho Cali's pho options are heavily weighted toward tripe.  It took me a good five minutes to figure out that they didn't offer a plain old beef flank bowl of pho;  closest was the #8, with flank and eye of round-- and no tripe.  Went with that, size small.  Service was quick.  Bowl was uninterestingly presented.  Broth was not too salty, and was spiced interestingly.  Lots of meat in the bowl.  Noodles were fine, but not memorable.   Ate all the bits of it, felt moderately happy.  It was tasty.  Restroom was one of the cleanest I've seen on St-Laurent.  Paper towel dispenser was inoperative, however.  Overall, a very clean joint, serving a perfectly good bowl, at a reasonable but not remarkably cheap price.  I'd gladly give them a fourth star if they'd done or cooked anything out of the ordinary, aside from keeping a clean floor and loo.  Alas, my impression of them remains that they're merely competent.  But they *are* competent.  Maybe the character will come with time."}
{"text":"LA meilleure place a montreal pour manger une pho ! Leurs soupe sont incroyable , de plus les vermicelles porc et crevettes sont divin!   En plein coeur du quartier chinois, ce petit resto est l'endroit parfait pour un repas vite fait et a bas prix ! Environ 10$ avec taxe par personne cest presque gratuit !"}
{"text":"One of many pho places in Chinatown. Quite authentic. Clean and bright. Quick service. It has been a popular restaurant for many years. I have been many times for pho but today I got a rice noodle dish with grilled shrimp, chicken and beef. Large portion of noodles but the noodles are mostly broken into many small pieces. It is quite dry as well. There was not much mint or basil either. The grilled meats were delicious.   I think it is like most pho places in Montreal, certainly not the best. I feel Pho Bang New York is better in the quality of the ingredients and the freshness of taste."}
{"text":"First at this resto. Quick service tea taste a little odd. The pho is good even though I'm not a fan of pho I ordered pork chop and chicken with salad and rice (heavy on the rice).   Tables are placed very close to one another so that's a little odd. Nobody wanted the table in front of the door because it was too cold.  Good staff good service and pretty good food for your money."}
{"text":"My sister is a foodie and she wanted to try out the best Pho place in Montreal. She did her research which lead us to  Pho Cali. The over all atmosphere and service was perfect until I paid. As a tourist from the USA I paid with America handing them a 20 dollar bill to cover the whole cost.  The person did not inform me that at Pho Cali the American and Canadian dollar is par. At the moment our dollar is 15% more. Thinking that  when giving the 20 dollars I included the tip. So the bus boy comes up to me and says \"you don't tip?\". That's when I explain to them to cash in my 20 dollars and collect the tip. He kept on assisting that we tip. I can't believe he had the guts to come up to me and ask that. I was furious, and gave him 5 dollars Canadian and left. In America waiters make 3-4 dollars an hour plus tips. In Canadian they make minimum wage plus tips. I am completely shock, upset and angry. I wont go back!"}
{"text":"That's riiiiight. I'm a fan !  The thing is I like this place for many reasons. Most reviews in this section mention the service. While not the smiliest bunch in the world there has been quite a change recently. The restaurant renovated and the staff has changed quite a bit. The beauty of this place is not to pick and chat with the staff... it's more about enjoying a good bowl of soup ! And oh boy oh boy oh boy It's dang good!  I'm a bit of fan of Pho Ga and Pho Bo soups (chicken and beef :) ) and I have been in quite a few vietnamese soup places. Most Noodle places have these cutsey dutsey presentation with menus you feel could have been designed by Apple. In the end though you end up with a nice bowl of hot water with little onions floating. You know what... I'm not a tea type person for soup persona. So what do I look for you ask ? Well it's a soup that actually tastes something. If you are familiar with how these soups are made you will notice that for one the base broth has been cooking for at least half a day to a day to have that kind of consistency. Second, most soup places  have BOILED chicken. These guys  had the genius of using something called THE GRILL! That might seem a little surprising but in the end it makes quite a difference.  I have brought many friends here and they always have loved it. All of them come back for more.   So if your a soup boy or girl and you want a happy soup well soup away sailor and get your spoon because the next mess on your shirt will certainly not be the Captain's...  Ah oy matee. Arr Arr.. Cough... hack! Well you get the picture."}
{"text":"The soup just so so, the service of the waiter is nice, BUT, When I paid the bill, 11.5$, I give the cashier 12$, and get ready the tips, the poker-face cashier put the exchange of 0.5$ into the tips plate directly, and order me give her 1 $ again, because the tips is not enough, I ask her I MUST pay? Not up to me? She say I MUST pay, not up to me, I was angry and refuse to pay the tips, I want to tell this restaurant, service tips is not granted?If you order the clients must pay the tips, NEVER! Even 1 cent!!!"}
{"text":"C'est simple : c'est LE meilleur resto de soupes tonkinoise que j'ai essayé (et j'en ai essayé!). Le goût du bouillon est indescriptible, comme s'il a mijoté pendant 2 jours durant! Le service est impeccable, voire minutieux et alerte. Bien sûr le menu est varié, mais il serait quasiment un sacrilège de ne pas choisir une soupe tonkinoise alors que c'est leur spécialité bien connu à Chinatown. Tout repas est accompagné d'un excellent thé jasmin servit dans une théière et laissée sur table pour le bon plaisir des clients. Il m'est même arrivé en hiver, de me rendre au restaurant et de demander une soupe tonkinoise pour emporter! Elle fut servit minutieusement dans des plats séparés pour assembler au travail et à une vitesse éclaire! (N. B: vous en ferez certainement des jaloux au travail ;p) ???"}
{"text":"The soup is taste nothing!and I don't understand why the boss of this restaurant think his soup is best in montreal...in Chinatown,the best soup is pho bac for me,but restaurant pho bac is not really clean.. Pho Cali,it's only a place for the tourist...not for local people..."}
{"text":"I really like the pho here.  It is one of the best!  The spring roll appetizer #3 is good and crispy ...just how I like it baby!  I like the #1 pho dac biet.  The broth is so amazing, clean, and fresh.  We normally only get the pho here.  The Bun Bo Hue soup is really good too.  Never had problems with the food, order, service, or bill.  The price is really good and reasonably cheap.  I don't know how you can complain with Good quality and cheapo food....im just saying.  Give it a go...A for awesome!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was suprisingly good!  The folks look a little grumpy, so you might think that they don't care about quality, but I was (happily) wrong.  I guess they feel a little stressed, probably because the kitchen is slow.  However, good, homemade tasting food sometimes comes out a little slower.  We all enjoyed our pho and appetizers.  Moreover, we appreciated that the food came out perfect.  The food was authentic and traditional.  Don't expect any fusion or inventive dishes.  The waiters? ....They are friendly and helpful, but not used smiling."}
{"text":"If you're famished, this Chinatown spot will do the trick on the cheap.  Get their com suon nuong (#19 on the menu), a grilled pork chop and salad on rice. Tender meat, decent sauce. Good-sized portion, too - you won't leave hungry. Their rolls appetizer is okay, but overall, you're in for a comforting Vietnamese meal.  Mysteriously, the staff weren't willing to combine two tables for a large group, so that group left. The place wasn't even packed! Go figure, their loss."}
{"text":"Simple, straight to the point, they have great plates at a reasonable cost. Don't expect megaservice, again, this Vietnamese restaurant is simple.  Recommend especially if you're in a hurry or with kids, no time wasted."}
{"text":"This place is packed during lunchtime. However, you won't wait very long, because service is extremely fast. Not the place for a long lunch.   I had glazed pork with a spring roll and vermicelli. I thought it was very good. My friend liked the pho. They give you tea and they will give you more if you ask .   Prices are very good. $10 or less for both of us. Nothing in the menu is above $15."}
{"text":"Along St. Laurent in the heart of Chinatown Restaurant Pho Cali isn't the only Vietnamese available, but the large windows and clean modern interior make for an inviting option. There are nearly a dozen types of pho available coming in four different sizes, an appealing selection of rice dishes plus Vietnamese coffee and everything else expected of all reputable Vietnamese restaurants in Montreal. In the end, I opted for a large bowl of classic pho, the kind with thin slices of raw beef on top.  A warm pot of tea arrived with the menu and even though the restaurant was busy on a sunny Sunday afternoon in March, the service was fast. First to arrive on a small plate was a healthy portion of crisp bean sprouts, several sprigs of fresh mint and a lime wedge. My noodles arrived a moment later in an oversized steaming bowl, inside laid tender slices of beef, still pink in spots, covering expertly cooked rice noodles. Unfortunately, the broth was a murky brown and a bit heavy, not award winning, but passable.  I finished off the noodles and beef feeling satiated but not stuffed. I was obliged to treat myself to a Vietnamese iced coffee.  If you've never had one, they are incredibly sweet and milky and so delicious. The first sip transported me straight back to Saigon where iced coffee is a way of life.   For about $15 Canadian dollars the bright atmosphere and ample good quality fresh ingredients will bring me back. Despite the experience of others, I thought the staff were doing a fine job, fast and efficient.  Overall it was a good value for my money and I'll go back when I'm hungering for pho in Chinatown."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a good bowl of pho. I usually go for #1 (all the meats), but I recently discovered #15, which is the spicy version of the broth, with a hint of lemongrass. It is so refreshing and flavourful, perfect dish to warm yourself up when you're suffering from continuous colds/flu. It actually opened up my sinuses and by the end of the meal, I was able to taste!  I went back when I recovered from my illnesses and enjoyed the whole thing."}
{"text":"Hailing from San Francisco, I thought the pho was good, portions large, price decent, service very quick. With tax and tip, I paid $9.03 for the menu item #1 in size large (base price $6.95). They included tax and tip in our bill.   The cashier accepted our U.S. money in a 1:1 ratio. Maybe it's because we came with a tour group, and our guide knew the employees? Who knows. As for the wait staff service...I'm used to the bare minimum Chinese-type attitude. Just get me my food. I don't need to be waited on hand and foot, asked how everything is with a smile, etc. The frills could make for an interesting dining experience if done properly (such as at Market Diner in Hell's Kitchen New York), but on most days, just allow me to eat and I'll be happy enough."}
{"text":"Really like this place! The pho was very nice, I had the small size of number 11. This was the right size for me, the price was reasonable and it was delicious! Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Pho place in the chinatown of Montreal.  The food came real quick.  We had a number 7 and 15.   15 is their spicy beef soup and i strongly recommend it.  Spicy food on a hot day actually cools you off.  Raising your temp/sweating ends up cooling you down when it evaporates.  Unfortunately, like many of the other restaurants in the area, they only accept cash which can be a bit of a bitch when you're from the states and paying atm fee's all the etime.  Our only complaint is that although we ordered the extra large's... for some reason the Vietnamese couple who sat down next to us half way thru our meal got a good bit more in their bowls.  So, be sure to tell them that you are Vietnamese."}
{"text":"Avoid. Pho Cali has a decent pho soup at best. The portions are okay. Same with the broth. However, I felt very dehydrated afterwards, which is an indication of a high quantity of MSG.  What infuriated me was the service. It was rather slow, unwelcoming, and some waiters clearly looked like they hated their job. Granted, it was during rush hour, but it clearly ruined the atmosphere.  To add insult to injury, while paying at the counter, the cashier intentionally gave back less change, and asked: \"Can I keep this for tips?\". I was very dissapointed in this rude behavior, and would definitely never go back again.  If you're looking for a nice pho, I've had a far better experience with other Pho's nearby."}
{"text":"Quoi! Je n'ai pas encore écrit d'avis sur ce Pho Cali! Impardonnable! Pho Cali est incontestablement mon premier choix de restaurant vietnamien. Pour un bon repas réconfortant, tant pour l'estomac que pour l'esprit et en toute saison.   On vous accueille avec une bonne tasse de thé. Ne vous laissez pas intimider par le menu multilingue. Vous avez le droit de poser des questions. À défaut de ne pas savoir quoi choisir, optez pour le numéro 14 extralarge. C'est une soupe-repas avec du poulet grillé avec une petite sauce. Soyez sans crainte, il n'y a rien de piquant dans le numéro 14. Le bouillon est tellement bon... Pour un peu plus de \" puch \",  regardez sur la table il y a quelques bouteilles : sauce Sriracha et une sauce de piments broyés. Ne pas oublier d'y ajouter du basilic, des fèves germées et quelques gouttes de jus de limes. Le tout pour moins de 10$!!   Pour ce qui est du décor, simplicité, des tables qui peuvent être déplacées, l'endroit est propre. Les employés parlent français et anglais, ce qui n'est pas toujours le cas dans le quartier chinois.   Pour le prix et le bon goût, c'est indéniablement à recommander."}
{"text":"Parfait endroit dans le Chinatown pour manger des Phô (et pleins d'autres plats merveilleux) sans se ruiner! Un repas complet pour deux  = 25$ tx et pourboire inclus! Le service est super et l'endroit a l'air pas mal plus propre que quelques restaurants à proximiter !"}
{"text":"I went there on a busy Saturday at the same time as nuit blanche. It was pretty crowded and we have to share a table with two other girls to eat.   We ordered a small bun bo hui with spring rolls as appetizers.  The food was pretty filling; we left with a happy stomach and enough energy to conquer the first half of nuit blanche.   The service wasn't the best on that night but we received our orders pretty fast."}
{"text":"Close, but no cigar!   I would have rated Pho Cali higher if it wasn't right next to a gazillion other good Vietnamese shops in Chinatown (esp Pho Bang New York, which is considered to be the best pho place in the area). The pho here is neither good or bad - just plain average, smack-dab in the middle.   The service is average as well (which is, of course, is based on the standard of typical Asian restaurants). One bonus is that the staff speak both French and English (and Vietnamese as well, I presume), unlike the staff in many of the other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday evening because the one we usually go was closed today. This restaurant was not busy at all. The place is bright and clean. We ordered two soup. We both found the cooked beef was not fresh.  Our stomach didn't digest the food very well. The noodle is very well cooked time-wisely, not saggy. The soup tasted good, not too salty."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés pour souper au resto Cali vendredi soir dernier. Nous avons été acceuillis avec du bon thé chaud (inclus). Nous avons commandé en entrée deux rouleaux impériaux qui etaient délicieux. Nous avons aussi commandé une soupe pho au boeuf piquant. Le bouillon était délicieux et il y avait une bonne quantité de boeuf. Par contre, cette soupe est servie avec des nouilles udon (plus grosse que les nouilles que l'on retrouve dans les soupes tonkinoises généralement). Les nouilles etaient la grande déception de cette soupe, selon moi. Notre deuxième plat: le plat de vermicelles et grillades de boeuf etait très bon, rien à dire de négatif.  Le service semble très rapide (les gens autour de nous recevaient leur assiettes assez rapidement) mais malheureusement, le serveur a oublié notre commande et il est passé un bon 25-30 minutes avant qu'il s'en rendre compte. Quand Il s'est rendu compte de son oubli, il a envoyé notre commande et on a été servi quelques minutes plus tard...   Les + : Le bon thé gratuit, les rouleaux imperiaux, le bouillon piquant de la soupe et les prix très bas.  Les -: Le serveur a oublié notre commande et les nouilles dans la soupe étaient décevantes.  3.5* aurait été une note parfaite pour ce resto. Bien mais pas un life-changing meal."}
{"text":"The pho was kind of overpriced in my opinion. Considering it is Montreal, I shouldn't be that surprised but I had pretty high expectations for pho. I ordered a spring roll, and it literally was just one spring roll and it cost me 3 dollars. Most expensive spring roll I've ever had, and it wasn't even that great."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a nice little clean restaurant in Chinatown. No decor really stands out but it's not a bad spot to go with friends. Plain and simple.  FOOD: The food is pretty good, better than I expected (since I was used to going to New York right next door). Pretty standard stuff if you compare it to the food in the area. Nothing really bedazzled me but it wasn't bad at all. I would come back here again.  PRICE: The prices are standard for the area as well. You get what you pay for. It's very affordable!  SERVICE: The service wasn't the best. It kind of feels like they don't really want to be there. They do try to get your food to you as fast as possible though, I just wish that their attitude were a bit better."}
{"text":"The service was quick and very friendly. The staff had good suggestions and answered any of our questions. They welcomed us warmly to the restaurant even though the kitchen was almost closed for the evening. The Pho was very good for the price and the servings quite generous. Overall a good experience."}
