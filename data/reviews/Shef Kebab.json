{"text":"I was so excited to go to this place because it was highly recommended. When i got there to order 1 lb for $5.99....she said the price is now $ 7.99 for 1 lb...while the ad in the parking lot before you turn to their store also says 1lb for 5.99 and also online the same price....
Another customer also came in and wanted to order the same thing because he saw the ad outside....
I just dont understand when you try to fight with your costumers and doesn't want to honour the price and she just keeps saying it's an old sign....then change or take the sign out so it's not misleading costumers. The person working there wasn't even friendly at all. Not going there ever again."}
{"text":"My family and I recently ordered catered dishes for my birthday. The food was great the delivery was quick and everything was complete except for some kind of garlic dip or tzatziki for the chicken would have been nice. Overall the food here keeps getting better and better and seems to be consistent with everyone I speak with. Definitely one of the tastier and healthier options of places to eat or get food from in the area. Armenian and Middle Eastern cuisine is very addictive because it's really not like anything else you have had before, if I could I'd live off the grill and cook every meal on the BBQ."}
{"text":"Great food made fresh when ordered, I'd recommend calling in advance. I've had numerous menu items and I like them all, quality of everything is great."}
{"text":"Very good middle eastern food, with some Russian and I believe (pardon my ignorance) Lebanese influence. Felafel sandwiches are simple and well balanced. Tabouli is lemony and fresh. Meals come with some hummus, pita, an option for carb and a small salad. Independently owned and seems to be a family run business. They take pride in their food and are quite pleasant too."}
{"text":"The owners of this Armenian place were very friendly.

I had the spicy chicken wrap and it was scrumptious. Although not as spicy as I'd like it, the sauce was very tangy. The food is cheap and made fresh in the open kitchen. It may take a while, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Shef Kebab is a small Armenian owned mom and pops style restaurant located in a small plaza just west of Warden Ave and Finch Ave E in Scarborough that serves Armernian and Middle Eastern cuisine.

I sometimes go there to eat after working out at a gym nearby. The place is quite small with just three tables and the business is more geared for takeout. I ordered the beef and spicy chicken combo which consists of a beef skewer, a chicken skewer and your choice of rice or garlic potatoes and a house salad, hummus and some pita bread ($13.95 plus tax). The beef and chicken were nicely seasoned and tender and moist. The chicken wasn't really spicy though. The rice was pretty basic and cooked properly. The combo came out in about 15 minutes which is pretty standard to ensure your kebabs are grilled properly and not undercooked.

If you are looking for a healthy food option in the Scarborough area with food that's pretty good and friendly service you should try Shef Kebab. Even though it's priced roughly a dollar per combo higher than it's competitors, it's still reasonably priced for the quality."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Shef Kebab for lunch as I was around the Warden/Finch area. Small restaurant that looks like it's more catered for take out but there are 3-4 tables if you want to dine in. Menu is extensive and there are many things to eat depending on what you are in the mood for. I ordered a spicy chicken kebab plate and it came with pita bread, hummus, and salad. Portions were generous and everything was delicious. Chicken was a bit mild for me in spice but the meat itself was very tender, juicy, and moist. The owner is very friendly and makes you feel right at home. Great service and delicious food, would come back for more if I'm around the area!"}
