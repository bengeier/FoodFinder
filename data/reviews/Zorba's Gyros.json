{"text":"Zorba's is just \"okay\" in my opinion. Some people love it and I just don't understand. The salads are good, but the chicken gyro was unimpressive...kind of bland and the chicken was really dry. I haven't gone back since I found Madonna's right down the street - which in my opinion is money better spent."}
{"text":"I got the worst salad of my life at Zorba's. Iceberg mix, soggy fries and hard tomatoes with a greasy piece of \"glazed\" salmon on top. Definitely not what I was expecting based on how much people rave about this place."}
{"text":"so, i go in and order a gyro (yee-ro - you know, how you're supposed to say it).  the server goes you mean a 'jai-ro?!' (as in gyroscope), in a very loud kind of condescending voice.  i said, no, i mean a 'yee-ro'.  as if she didn't know what i was talking about anyway!

with the greek authenticity of the place seriously in question, i should've walked away then, but i was really hungry and didn't have a lot of time for lunch.  it was just average, nothing special.  again, i've been spoiled by NYC.  besides, i think it's a good policy to not eat where they can't properly pronounce what they're serving."}
{"text":"The portion and the taste of the gyro meat is on another level. I shouldn't eat that much for lunch, but how can you stop?!?!"}
{"text":"Usually only order their Grilled Chix Salad which is good. They make home made ranch dressing and their salads have no cheese which I prefer. And of course, since this is PGH, fries are included. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch!

The reviews on yelp don't do this place justice.  The food coming out of the kitchen looked great --- especially the gyro's and french fries.

I opted for the Quad-S (my term not theirs) Summer Sensation Salad with Salmon.  Big salad, not skimping on the ingredients, and nice piece of fish on top.

I'll definitely be back. (once I finish my tour of lunch spots in Pittsburgh, I'm on about #45 without repeating)

Plenty of seating, and they move you through quick despite the lines...."}
{"text":"I first want to start off by saying I really love zorbas food I've been treating myself to lunch there every pay day since I started downtown in 2005 the food is great, recently my employer change my breaks from one full hour to a half hour so I no longer have time to eat my full salad. When the cashier said here or to go I said here but I would like a to have it in a to go box bc I may not have time to finish it bc our breaks changed that way I can take it home for dinner or keep it at work for the next day, she rudely said that's an extra dollar? I said for a to go box? She said yes if you eat it in here in a to go box it's an extra dollar I said huh? Stunned I'm thinking well I save you the food cost of no cucumbers tomatoes or onions I don't get on my salad I would have threw out and you change me a dollar to get it in a to go box? I know food cost can be expensive but there is always a line full of people in there at around 9-11$ a salad so I'm sure the business is doing well. Not a good customer experience especially from someone who was a regular customer I know my bi weekly visits will not make or break them but I'll spend my money else where. I could see if it was every day issue but it's twice a month and I'm not asking for a plate and a Togo box ?? 11 year customer experience that's awful I will never ever eat in there again."}
{"text":"I've been to Zorba's numerous times and I've never once been disappointed by their food. I can never decide what I want to get. The tuna melt pita and buffalo chicken salad are amazing!! Their ranch is delicious also. FYI, it's cash only. The prices are reasonable for lunch!"}
{"text":"Zorba's is traditional Pittsburgh. Tons of fries on salads. Portions are huge. The people who work here are friendly. Specials are a great deal."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Gyros in Pittsburgh! There are four types of gyros to choose from: Lamb & beef, chicken, steak and vegetarian.

There are long lines at lunch time but, they move quick. Seating is hard to come by as well. You best bet is to get it to go.

They offer all types of different things like burgers, wings, shrimp, salads, tuna melts, steak hoagies and much more.

They offer Daily Specials as well.

Monday  - Free Fries with any sandwich
Tuesday  - Chicken Gyro with fries
Wednesday  - Shish Ka Bob Salad
Thursday  - Gyro and fries
Friday  - Fish Sandwich and fries

The only things that I don't like is that they close at 3pm daily and they're not open on the weekend.

If God made gyros this is what they would taste like!"}
{"text":"Great place to go downtown if you are looking for something hearty and decently portioned. I caught up with a friend during the week here. Stopped in and ordered a chicken salad. It gets pretty packed around lunch, so plan ahead. 

Ordered the food and went to sit down to wait. It took about 10 minutes to get my sandwich. It was huge. If I wasn't so greedy, I would have saved some for dinner. But I am greedy, so I ate. And ate. And ate until I cleared my plate. It was really fresh, and well seasoned. 

The inside of it reminds me of a school cafeteria. If it was up to me, I would do take out, and enjoy my lunch in another location. 

But overall, you can't beat fresh, affordable, fast food."}
{"text":"It's been a few months since I've ate at Zorbas. I wanted to order the famous salmon salad because they are really good. I called around 11:30am and they stated they don't offer the salmon salad. I think they should update their menus online. I also seen someone tweet that they haven't had the salmon salad in some months now. What I don't like is that they tend to run out of food but they are open until 4:30p."}
{"text":"The Gyro's are great and on Mondays you get free fries with them.  It's a great deal for a downtown lunch."}
{"text":"Best  grilled salmon salad in the burgh! With a price tag of less than $10.00

 Even better then what you would pay twice as much for in fancier resturants. 

 I like to think of myself as some what of a salmon salad connoisseur lol

But really I have gone to places where the size of the salmon is more of a small nugget than a fillet of fish. 

I always order the grilled salmon salad here and the only time I am dissappointed is when they are sold out. 

They grill the salmon with skin on it's so flavor and a little charred in the best way.

I always have mine made with extra feta cheese. Zorba's does salmon right. 

The resturant is bright and light and fun to hang out at for lunch."}
{"text":"The best gyro that I've had in Pittsburgh. The amount of meat on the sandwich varies quite a bit. All depends on who's making the sandwich. The younger gentleman makes a small gyro consistently while the lady who does the majority of the cooking makes a huge gyro. This really affects the taste and consistency of the gyro. The more meat the merrier...stay hungry my friend!"}
{"text":"I'm a little Zor right now so I'm just gonna relax on the couch and write this review.

It's been a long time since I had the Gyro (Pittsburghese: Jeye-row) here but I remember it being pretty good which is why I give it four stars. The chicken gyro on the other hand is not a real chicken gyro so that would score 2. And the last few times I've tried to come here it's been closed when it was supposed to be open and I don't appreciate that. So if that happens again it will be going down to three stars."}
{"text":"Zorba's is a pretty decent lunch spot in Pittsburgh. I haven't been there in years and ran in today feeling like I wanted fries and ranch. I ordered the Buffalo chicken salad and although I do wish there was more Buffalo sauce on the chicken, it was pretty tasty. They have a fish special on Fridays that looks really good but it must sell out pretty quickly because they were out of it. Zorbas wasn't too busy but I know from past experience that it's crazy during the lunch rush. Some people say the service is rude but I've never found the people who work there to be rude; they're just trying to get you in and out! I think I'll come back again soon and try that fish on a Friday! 
*update* I've tried the fish sandwich and it is amazing! Definitely shareable."}
{"text":"At the daily special rates price point, the quality/tastiness of food, and friendly service, I am rating Zorba's 5 out of 5.  Gyro's and fries here are delicious, however my favorite special is the buffalo chicken salad with ranch, so good.  In general they have juicy tasty chicken, I think its grilled or baked, but never disappoints.  

The restaurant is very clean and the open kitchen design is a appealing to me, because I see the cooks using gloves and demonstrating safe food handling.

I would knock a half star off for the drink selections, but there is usually something i like.  Also the line can get long during rushes and the staff works hard to take orders quickly and get the food out."}
{"text":"What happened? :( this used to be my favorite spot before. Hadn't eaten here in over a year & stopped in for lunch today. Ordered a gyro special and while the portion size and the deliciousness of the gyro is the same, everything else isnt. 

1. Drinks used to be $1. The cooler is full of basic apple juice, orange juice & CANS of pop that are sold at gas stations for 50 cents. Zorbas now sells them for like $1.40.

2. Their ranch used to be delicious. Now it is completely watered down & lacks any flavor at all.

3. No more wings!!!! There's a sign that says \"wings are off the menu to to quality & price\" Wings cant be that much to buy in bulk, right? Half the restaurants in the city offer them for 50 cents one day a week. -_-

Change isn't always good. While the giant portions & courteous staff are still great, things mentioned above makes Zorbas seem like they are trying way to save a dollar."}
{"text":"Pass on this place they're terrible! Ordered takeout- I called to let them know my order was made incorrectly and that I didn't receive what I paid for. The phone was passed around because no one really wanted to handle it. The \"alleged\" manager got on the phone and said that it was made properly (go figure) which to me is ultimately disrespectful by discrediting me because I wouldn't for a second waste my time calling to complain about something if I had no reason to. All in all this place doesn't treat their customers right & I wouldn't take the gamble if I were you in ordering from them. Take your money elsewhere as I plan to."}
{"text":"Now this is good eatin'. It's not fancy, but it sure is tasty. A co-worker introduced me to this place on a recent trip to Pittsburgh. The salads are, dare I say, awesome. To be clear I'm not normally a salad person. At lunch time it was busy, but they kept  the line moving like clockwork so we were in and out of the door quickly. Although they were quick they weren't rude or rushed, just efficient.

For those of you not from Pittsburgh, just know that they put french fries on the salad. Which totally explains why a non-salad person like me loves their salads.

This place is why it's great to live in a city!"}
{"text":"The food is decent most of the time, but freshness is unpredictable.  A little pricey if you don't go with the daily special.  Salads are usually good but cost around $9.  The regular gyros are okay, but certainly not my favorite among the restaurants that serve them dowtown.  I found the chicken gyro to be mediocre, but gave it a second chance thinking it may have just been a bad batch, only to be displeased the second time as well.  Also, be warned it is cash only."}
{"text":"Cheap prices, the portions are big (& should fill you up), plus there's specials!
Fries are so decent enough... one time I ate em out of the trash. True story

(But hear me out.... they were still in the container. My coworkers' eyes are bigger than his stomach, and he tossed them without even offering them to me! Like, he really barely ate any. So yeah... I pretended like I was in the bathroom shitting, waited for him to clockout, and picked those b*tches out the trash, first picked-off the little bits of lettuce & tomato leftover from his beef gyro... and hid the fries in an empty container I had in my lunchbox. I regret nothing)

EDIT:
After eating here three times (thus far), their food isn't all that great. I should have taken pictures, but I don't exactly want to \"ruin\" them over my bad experience. The portions are still huge and prices are nice. But they just slop together To-Go orders, and I assume you have to get to the fries quick, because every time I eat em they're soggy.

However, are terrible as the Steak hoagie looked... it was actually good! But be prepared to be disappointed in presentation"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. You receive a ticket and the pick up your orderwhen they say it's ready. We had two of the specials of the day. Buffalo chicken salad and a spinach, sliced strawberries, Gorgonzola, pecans and onions salad.  I also had also had grilled chicken on my strawberry salad.   I asked for no onions in the salad and the counter person assured me it would be no problem.  After fifteen minutes (and three numbers  after ours being called) we went back to the counter to check on our order.  She assured us that we weren't forgotten and ten minutes later here comes our orders. My friend's Buffalo chicken salad was piled high with French fries (A Pittsburgh staple I have come find), plenty of Buffalo chicken and nicely spiced. This is not for someone who doesn't like the heat. My salad came exactly as stated with three fairly large grilled chicken breasts. 
They were cleaning to close early for the holiday and that was used as an excuse as to why it took so long for our food. We ate quickly because our lunchtime was greatly diminished by the wait for food. Salads were both great tasting and large enough to be satisfying. While we were eating someone kept coming by and taking the condiments off our table. They didn't ask about the food or if  everything was alright. 
I would go back again because of the food but don't expect any kind of service. That just seems too hard for them."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once before. Walking through town I saw it & thought I would see what they had. I decided to go with the Steak Hoagie, & some cheese sauce on the side. I waited about 20 minutes to get it (on my lunch break), & normally I wouldn't be upset, but when other people who ordered after me started getting their numbers called before mine I started getting pissed off. Especially when the cooks kept making salads instead of my lunch. I've included this very depressing looking \"Steak Hoagie\". I know it's a lunch rush but this thing was sloppily put together. In addition, the use steakum like meat. I was expecting a steak hoagie like you'd get in Philly, & not these slabs of reprocessed steak. I paid $5.75 for the sandwich, $0.80 for cheese sauce that tasted worse than 7-11 cheese sauce, & $1.25 for a can of soda. The food was terrible & the cooks need to get it together."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after reading on Yelp how good it is.  This is no Mike and Tony's or big greek gyro in Market square.  I won't be back.  They only take cash. The workers are not Greek chefs and are very condescending.   The gyro sandwich for $5 was OK at best.  They threw some tomatoes on it. The sauce could be better.  The fries for $2.50 were undercooked.  I asked for ketchup and was told to find a table with a bottle.  We are talking a plain bottle with mystery ketchup. It was definitely not Heinz which is a sin in Pittsburgh!   I had to hunt silverware and straws.  You would think they would give them to you with the meal.  

They charge about $2 for a drink with no free refills.  They put a sign that said refills are 50 cents and if you take one without paying you are stealing and subject to prosecution.  You can also get a drink from their cooler for $1.  They are no-name juices or water like you might find in a dollar store for 25 cents or less.  

Tables were not very clean.  I was surprised at the number of patrons.  This place is definitely regularly visited. They have daily specials, but the #1 item on my list is quality and taste of food.  They get a C from me."}
{"text":"Great Service, Great Prices, and Great Quality.  I can't complain with a good gyro and fresh hand cut fries."}
{"text":"Zorba's claim to fame is their \"famous chicken salad\". After hearing people at work talk so lovingly about this dam salad I decided to try it. First thing first, they have pretty normal downtown hours, so dinner is not an option and Zorba's gives new meaning to the term \"lunch rush\". It's crazy busy, and although they are quick, with the line out the door you will wait. They almost seem on the cusp of rude, but its really just that they're in game mode. I've gone at like 3:30 and they are talkative and joking and very nice. 
Now....the food. For a person who loves a \"Pittsburgh\" style chicken salad it really hit the spot. It's basically iceberg lettuce, cucumber, tomato, chicken and a heaping load of hand cut French fries. There's nothing overtly special about it, but it is somehow yummy in its basicness. I'm sure it's the just the fried potatoes, but its yummy non the less.
The menu is a few salads and some gyros with different meats, but they do have a few options that were rather surprising, like the strawberry chicken salad. Also on the menu is a salmon salad but once the salmon goes, it's gone, so go early."}
{"text":"Well I had my first and last visit to Zorbas. The place was dark and dirty. Salt and pepper shakers were gritty and sticky. Ketchup bottles had a gross goop at the top. Seating was abundant. They now take credit cards as of 2/15/16. Ordered a gyro and the meat was cold. Not acceptable. Fries- generous serving for a free add on (Monday special). I really don't see the hype. Mike and Tony's is much better. I don't think I would return."}
{"text":"We ran into here after trying to find this sandwich shop called Sammies. Yelp said it was on smithfield near 4th but It must have closed because all we found was a 7/11 and subway. We found Zorba's on the corner and considering how cold it was neither of us felt like walking to search for food.  

We stumbled in here after reading the outdoor menu mentioning specials. The hubby  ordered the buffalo chicken salad which is the special on Wednesdays. I went with the gyro salad which came with a side of pita bread. The hubby's salad was huge, topped with fries and plenty of chicken, not to mention lettuce. He choose balsamic dressing which I thought was weird but he enjoyed it. The fries were great, nice and hot while the chicken was mildly spicy but a little bit dry.

My salad was just as big but it was mostly lettuce. At first I thought they were a little scant on the lamb meat but  almost like the loaves of bread that Jesus fed to the hungry, it just kept showing up. I was a little disappointed at the quality of lettuce. I hate those big crunchy chunks that you find close the root, they are so bitter no matter how much dressing you use. 

So the reason I give this place only 3 stars is because of my salad. Crunchy bitter lettuce, gyro meat was a luke warm instead of hot which after 5 minutes made it cold because of the chilled dressing. Not to mention the dressing was rather bland and they didn't add enough to my huge salad so i ended up ordering more which cost 75 cents. The fact that I had to order more dressing even though it had little to no flavor was disappointing. 

There is enough seating in here but just some simple tables and chairs spread out, nothing fancy or worth taking pictures for. It's almost like a cheap cafeteria which I don't mind if the foods good but I wasn't impressed with my gyro meat or with the chicken on the salad. Sometimes places have an off day so I won't count this place out just yet. 

P.S bring cash only!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience after almost a year since the last time I was here. Ingredients weren't fresh and the gyro was heavy on the spices."}
{"text":"Very reasonable daily specials, and large portions, of tasty fresh prepared food.  Not the most gourmet experience out there, but a fantastic value, and reliable consistent experience without a long wait.  I particularly recommend the grilled chicken salad (Bangin' homemade greek and ranch dressing) and gyro's."}
{"text":"Great for a lunch gyro or salad. I go here all the time for a quick salad. The vegetarian salads are basically roasted red peppers and fries (a few tomatos and cucumbers) so nothing fancy.
The lines are typically long, but you never wait more than ten or 15 minutes. Or you can order ahead of time and pick it up."}
