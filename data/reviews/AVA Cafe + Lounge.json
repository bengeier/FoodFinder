{"text":"This place is so good!  I loved Quiet Storm and was sad when it closed, but now Ava's is basically the same thing.  I had a spinach salad with pumpkin seed pesto.  It came with beets and goat cheese and was delicious!  It was so good I got food to go for my next meal.  The tofu wrap was so good and my husband said the turkey bahn mi was really good too.  Go try this place!  I saw they deliver with happy bellies."}
{"text":"Randomly decided to stop by here one rainy afternoon.  The place is so much nicer than it appears from the street--just fun, relaxed, and a bit eclectic.  Those words can also be used to describe their menu.  I had the 'anytime quinoa' and a thai coffee.  It was the perfect after-work pick-me-up.  The service was great as well.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"OMG!!  I decided to stop in Ava Cafe and Lounge one beautiful afternoon before getting a haircut at a shop around the corner from it.  I stopped in the barbershop first and was waiting for my barber to come in.  I strolled over to Ava because I was hungry and hadn't eaten at the new location yet.  Plus, I used to really enjoy going to the Shadow Lounge during its early days to relax and chill.  So, I get there and greeted warmly by Justin Strong and Anand.  I'm really enjoying the peaceful atmosphere and watching Justin's daughter perform as if she's at an open mic.  Adorable!  I take a seat and ask for a menu.  I check it out and decide to get the Jive Turkey wrap.  Justin begins to express how much he loves the carmelized onions on it.  As I'm waiting, my barber comes in to grab a shake.  As we begin to get into a deep chat, I take a bite of the wrap.  I immediately stopped everything, stood up, gave a pound to Anand and announced to the world how DAMN GOOD it was!  It was sweet, but not too sweet.  The onions WERE on point.  It was just the right amount of everything.  And I got a meal, which included tortilla chips (I think) and freshly made lemonade with Guava.  De-li-cious!  I said I could have been talking about ANYTHING, love, peace, war in Iraq, GOD, and I would have still stopped everything, stood up, gave a pound to Anand and announced to the world how DAMN GOOD it was!  I can't wait to try out the rest of the menu.  And the price was just right!  Stop by as soon as you can and tell them spoken word artist/actor, Leslie \"Ezra\" Smith, sent you!!"}
{"text":"The menu is awesome and the space is kitschy and artistic. Support small local business! I recommend the great coffee drinks and limeade :) the kale salad is incredible!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great coffee - the turkey press is especially yummy. Can't go wrong stopping by this place with its fun, funky atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been here three times, delicious all three! Place has always been empty, not sure why, as the food is great and so is the service. I've had the turkey banh mi, mezzedilla, and the turkey press. Each is plenty of food; can easily split the turkey press. The golden oat shake is good and could almost be a meal on its own.

Oh yeah, free wifi."}
{"text":"SSSLLLLLOOOOWWWW. Food was average. Atmosphere lacking and dirty glasses stacked on top of each other behind the bar. The person making the food had a bad attitude and seemed liked they didn't want to be bothered by my order."}
{"text":"I tried this place not too long after they just opened. I was passing by, so I got food to go and ordered their daily special for the day, a 7-veggie quesadilla. I came during off peak hours, so the place wasn't busy. But the owner was super friendly. He offered me water while I waited and sat at the bar. The quesadilla was very good, and a much larger portion than I expected. It came with some curry sauce on the side for dipping, which complemented the flavors well. What I like about the place is that they try to serve healthy dishes, without compromising on taste. For now I'll round up my 4.5* rating, especially since they are a new business and I hope to see them stick around!"}
