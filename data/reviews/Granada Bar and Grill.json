{"text":"We enjoyed Friday night dinner of Cheese platter, Ribeye, and Beet salad. Excellent all the way around. Beautifully plated and well seasoned. Our server Roberta was attentive and knowledgeable. We will be back. Only problem is no wifi, not a good thing for a sports bar!!"}
{"text":"What an update!!! This place looks amazing. The food and beverages are still on point. Very welcoming and clean! I'm glad to be a local here."}
{"text":"This was really a disappointing experience. We originally were seated on the bar side where we were overwhelmed by an incredibly loud group and ignored by our server.  We walked ourselves to the restaurant side and encountered the poor work of the kitchen. That included a burger ordered medium but served raw and beef ordered medium well but needing 4 more minutes on the grill to heat up to rare. French fries on two orders were served cold and a sandwich ordered with an extra (that we were billed for) was not served with that extra.  I know these issues are all kitchen related. While we were comp'd one of the bad meals without being asked, there did not seem to be general concern about the problems from our server."}
{"text":"This place was located at our hotel.  We had a coupon in our room and decided to use it.  Three server was nice,  but seemed to be all alone. The service in turn was kinda slow.  I was worried about the food bc the bread came out just a few cold slices kinda blah...But the food we ordered was quite good. The wings were big and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were thick and creamy.  My husband steak was cooked well.  My filet was overcooked,  but i didn't say anything as fear of having to wait for another to be refired. It was still tasty just overcooked the salad it was served with was delicious just the right amount of dressing. Overall it was a decent meal."}
{"text":"I would have left there tonight offering a3 star review. Dinner was adequate. Service was great. But I stuck around for dessert. OMG. A hidden talent exists at Granada and her name is Macey. Her pineapple upside down cake with coconut ice cream was spectacular!!  I have never asked to meet a chef ect. Ever at a restaurant but tonight I did. I probably will be back tomorrow night for at least dessert.   Macey, you are unsung hero and an incredible pastry chef. Congratulations on your skills. If u ever need a recommendation let me know  Tomorrow night I am stopping by for the peach Cobbler or creme brûlée. Maybe both  Mad skills. Thank u!!!  I came back a second night which is unusual for me particularly for a hotel restaurant. Did not disappoint!    Felix the bartender, Curran the manager, and mad skills Macey providing dessert. So many others from the hostess who is wonderful to the server who brought me my meal. You all far exceeded my expectation.   Keep up the great work. Great restaurant and great hotel. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"If your a waitress on your shift, don't bring your plate of nasty nachos behind the bar and start nibbling and chatting about the customers you are serving. They were licking their nacho fingers in-between courses people were eating. The bartender with an accent is still there too, but even though he is nice, he is just too formal. It's the Embassy, not the Four Seasosn.   Not sure what tom say about this redesigned bar. They redesigned the menu also and now it appears to be another over priced hotel bar. The Embassy Suites rates are double what the Chaparral Suites cost, so it makes sense to jack other prices up as well. They still have a HH menu, but it's not that appealing anymore to the sports type and they still have alot of TV sets with sports packages, but the room looks more formal now and not as fun. The tourists will pay whatever, so it won;t affect business, but it's sad to see the 4th Floor gone to hell and $30 steaks on the bar menu."}
{"text":"The deviled eggs were great, the bacon added just the right amount of crunch. The Ahi tuna hummus salad with arugula got my protein in for the day with some excitement for the taste buds. Quality."}
{"text":"I went there tonight for dinner for my kids birthday. They have totally changed the menu from when it used to be the 4th floor grill. It was disappointing and sooo overpriced! The food  wasn't horrible.. just not great. They changed the fish & chips. That used to be the best in town. Now... just okay. We also ordered a cheese pizza. Our server asked us if we wanted fresh mozzarella on it. We said sure. So they charged us for a make your own pizza as opposed to just a cheese pizza... a little sneaky. The food was just okay, but so overpriced. In that area there are some really good restaurants. So disappointing that we drove all the way out there & paid so much for mediocre food."}
{"text":"We just got done eating Christmas dinner as we speak. There is new management and a new Chef at the Granada formerly the 4th Floor Grill. Not only was there a wonderful choice on the menu but it was all prepared perfectly and served with a wonderful presentation.   Not one complaint was had between the five of us. It was quality food at a reasonable price. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is the quintessential hotel lobby bar! Completely void of character with overpriced, sub-par food. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, if I were staying here, it would be an adequate place to obtain food & beverage.  This place is intended for one particular demographic; the hotel guests who can not or do not wish to venture out to the dozens of fine establishments just minutes away in OldTown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We are staying at the Embassy Suites for business and decided to hit the sports bar for a quick bite, one word, Sliders! Holy cow were they good. Service was excellent and prompt . A little diamond in the middle of a really large hotel and conference center.  By the way our server / bar tender ( Roberta. ) is a rock star."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed dinner here.  Tom, the bartender, was great and the food was excellent.  I ordered the Filet and was excellent.  It came with this elephant garlic spread and was absolutely fantastic.  A GREAT filet for the price."}
{"text":"Safe your money and go In& Out burgers! I had meat lovers pizza and salad ... not very good"}
{"text":"This is for the bar portion because the bartender Felix was a douche. His comments when we entered the bar area and his comments offended my friend. Atmosphere was \"meh\". I wouldn't go back."}
