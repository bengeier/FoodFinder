{"text":"Ambience: Great layout. Seating around the bar, chefs table/grill and by the windows.   Service: Super friendly and helpful.   Food: Fabulous with a South American twist as per chef's heritage. Great place for steak lovers and they also have some great looking sea food options.  Value: no complaints, and there is corkage (30$) Our apple cobbler desert for 1 was good enough for 3!  Notes: since this place is new they still have some issues to resolve,one of which I think they might need another grilling station. So be a lil patient, it is worth it, unlike-imho- its predecessor Daisho.   Repeat: Yes"}
{"text":"Highlights of the meal:  1. Corn flatbread with Drew's grass fed butter 2. Tita's mash  Note: Prices have increased since our June 13th visit."}
{"text":"It`s a rip-off. We ordered the 75dollar snapper advertised as enough for 2-3 persons; it was barely enough for 1. They didn't even debone it.  Upon complaining bitterly and disappointed the manager offered to reverse the charge for the dish. He knew very well that the portion was tiny."}
{"text":"Absolutely speechless.  One word to describe this place  \"amazing\". At first, when I read the previous reviews about the corn flat bread, I think to myself, how good can corn flat bread be?? But it's like \"wow\" so tasty. I ate two by myself. The texture was really good, along with the cheese and the crunch of the peanuts. I can eat these every day! Actually just the corn bread itself tasted so good! Monforte Cheese - toasted peanuts 15 Try the hot sauce that they make in-house, it's so good and not too spicy. In fact this spicy sauce went well with the corn bread.  The Grilled Clams - 'nduja, basil breadcrumbs 27 were a good size and the chef cooked it in front of me as I was sitting near the oven bar side. Lovely team, and excellent service. Made my day! My waiter was very informative, provided me with great recommendations; very attentive and helped me paired my sake and wine with my food. Excellent service.   And last but not least, my sizzling prawns with spinach and guajillo. The flavours were good and a good balance with the garlic and spinach. However, I would prefer the actual shrimp a little more firm.  The steak looks amazing, the heat looks very high. There's different types of wood in there, along with  Bincho. I can't wait until I come back to try the steaks!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and excellent service. I think they daintily wiped our table down like 10 times. By far the most delicious items were 1) the flatbread and 2) the special-of-the-day dessert which was a coconut ice cream cake dipped in chocolate with a peanut butter fudge base. This was the perfect Christina Tosi-reminiscent dessert because it basically combined ALL OF THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE (ice cream, peanut butter, and chocolate) and reminded me of my childhood. I hope they make this a permanent dessert on the menu. I enjoyed the butter and tomatoes/feta with the flatbread, but I do think $12 for butter seems a bit crazy.   We had the romaine salad and spicy greens salad; I thought they were both good. The Tita's mash is a mashed potato cooked in a cast iron pan and covered with crispy cheese - delicious. I liked that there were some complimentary \"extras\" served with the meal, which were a bowl of bone broth and very interesting pickled fruits/vegetables.   For mains we shared the butcher's steak which comes with a large green chili pepper on top - it's NOT a shishito pepper and when one of my friends accidentally took a huge bite of it the waiter was kind enough to bring a tall glass of milk to combat the burning of her esophagus. Be warned! Was it the best steak of my life? Definitely not - I just don't think it can compare to other steakhouses in the city. But it was tasty and perfectly cooked. The other main we had was the grilled whole snapper - this was an extremely generous portion but I wasn't crazy about the overall taste. It's served with various herbs to wrap the fish in. To be honest I thought both mains were good, but not exceptional/memorable and if I went back I would probably opt for one of their larger steaks instead (as this is supposed to be a take on an Argentinian steakhouse).   In conclusion: order the bread with butter (and maybe the other dips) and the ice cream cake if they have it, avoid the whole grilled fish, maybe try one of their larger steaks. I would be curious to try their other seafood options as well."}
{"text":"What a perfect dining experience. Kojin has amazing food and amazing service. While I really would have liked a more \"asian\" inspired menu, given that it's part of the Chang empire, I was very impressed by all the dishes we had. The staff was fantastic - perfect service, chef visited table to check on us. Just a great experience overall."}
{"text":"Came here on opening night (last night) after seeing that they were opened. Got a reservation for 1 since no one else wanted to join me so last minute, which turns out to be a godsend. I got there and was sat right beside Masterchef Canada judges Michael Bonacini and Claude Aprile along the bar facing the wood grill oven. The big man himself, David Chang was there cooking, managing and making sure everything was going smooth.  I ordered the grilled clams ($21) as a starter, which was a pretty good price for clams that size. The chef gave me a tomato salad on the house and it was the best tasting tomatoes I've ever had. For my main, I ordered the Butcher Steak ($35) which came out perfectly grilled, med rare, and full of burnt wood flavour. I also tried Tita's Mash, which is the chefs version of mashed potatoes except with Gouda and cheese curds and torched at the top. The food overall was delicious and the service was some of the best I've experienced anywhere in the world. I would definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner here, everything from the service, the food, the ambiance was great. We sat at the chef's counter in front of their wood-fired grill and enjoyed watching the chefs in action.  We got cocktails to start, I tried the Mule and it tastes great! It was also pretty big and I couldn't finish it.  Everything we tried on the menu was outstanding! The corn flatbread with monforte cheese is delicious, we devoured it quickly and they kindly offered a second one. We then tried the fluke crudo and the spicy greens. Both dishes were great and refreshing! Fluke crudo came with additional sauce in case we wanted to add more, which we did. For the main course, we had the bone-in fillet mignon and bbq zucchini. The steak was perfect, it was medium-rare and just melts in your mouth. Zucchini was a great compliment to the steak!  Overall, we will definitely come back here and try more things!"}
{"text":"Great service. Fabulous food. All the dishes we tried were enjoyable. The grilled shrimp was delicious, but really all of it was. Really enjoyed our waiter as well, great guy and great service. Chef came by to check on us as well, which was a nice touch from her."}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto and had a wonderful dinner at Shoto the last time we were here, so we decided to try brand new Kojin. Ultimately we were very impressed with our meal, and the service was spectacular. My boyfriend said he felt like a King, and while it is somewhat expected at this price point, we thought the service went above and beyond. My boyfriend is half Columbian, so we were also excited to try what we guessed to be some Columbian inspired dishes.  We started with grilled clams and corn flatbread with Niagara ham and cherries. I thought that the cherries worked exceptionally well with the ham, and the chewy ham on top of the cheesy warm bread made everything come alive. I had strong memories of comfort food and it reminded me affectionately of really good deep dish pizza! That was surprising but amazing. My boyfriend loves the salsa it came with and we started putting it on everything we ate during the meal as we were offered a second helping. We were also offered more bread as we decimated the first piece because we also ate that with the clams. While we really liked the clams, we both felt it needed a little something more. The flavor of the clams was overpowered by a ragu inside and needed a sharper note. I also did not taste the grilled component as much.   Next we had dry aged ribeye with Tita' s mash and zuchinni which our server had advised would be a nice balance and it was. We LOVED the steak, but the cook was slightly uneven, somewhere around medium well. I would have preferred it less done, but we were not asked how we would like it cooked. The zuchinni was also slightly salty but had a fantastic grilled flavor that we loved.   Lastly we had blueberry cobbler with earl grey tea. Our server lovingly presented the cobbler by finishing presentation at the table. What a beautiful spectacle, this had all seated next to us watching in awe. I would say if you want to finish your meal with a special touch, please order this. They said this would feed two but we think it could easily feed four. It was not traditonal cobbler but like a creamy corn cake. It reminded me of a sweet corn dish my family made but with tart blueberry compote. The tea was the best I've ever had.   Really great overall, and the staff truly made it a special experience for us."}
