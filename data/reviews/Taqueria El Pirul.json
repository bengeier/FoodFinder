{"text":"wish they hadn't run out of menudo. place is legit, makes fresh tortillas,  very little english is spoken, i'd avoid the carnitas, were dry, everythign else was pretty good."}
{"text":"So. So. Good. Had tacos de chorizo on HANDMADE (bless it!) corn tortillas. With cilantro and onions. Super simple with limes on the side and a bottle of coke. Real roadside taco kind of tacos. Super yum."}
{"text":"It's not going to replace my favorite real deal taco joints, but for being in a small town it's pretty good. The chips seemed like they came out of a bag, but they had really good sauces."}
{"text":"I gem of a taqueria that makes fresh, authentic, handmade, tortillas. Many different types of tacos such as asada, carnita, lengua, and tripa.  You can also get complete plates with beans and rice as sides.   There is also menudo if that is one of your favorites.  Breakfast items are also available.  The building is a little odd but they have an \"A\" rating so you know the place is clean. English is not problem with the staff.  If you like real Mexican food, try this place!"}
{"text":"I sent my wife in first on a recon mission: yes they have an \"A\" sanitation rating, yes, they have tables and yes, they take credits cards. It's a small place with two flat screens playing spanish language tv (telenovellas). Our waitress was bubbly and had some good recommendations. My favorites were the tacos (one with Puerco al pastor and one with chorizo) both on homemade tortillas. The next best were the Huaraches. Basically a flat bread with the meat of your choice (mine was chorizo) covered in lettuce, cheese and sour cream. Delicious!! They have Mexican Coke and Jarritos (Toronja = grapefruit is the best!!!). Great little hole in the wall place for good tacos if you're passing through Gastonia."}
{"text":"Mala experiencia los tacos al pastor no saben a nada el agua de jamaica sabe a agua con saborisante de tienda y los tacos de asada no saben a nada también sabe a carne con sal nada más así que no se los recomiendo mucha grasa en los tacos de asada además no es mexicano es colombiano así que no lo recomiendo"}
{"text":"Great carne Asada tacos with hand made corn tortillas. Wish they made their own tortilla chips. Also wish they spoke a little English, my Spanish isn't that great. The food is worth fumbling through the order process."}
{"text":"Delicious! The salsa is good even though the chips are from a bag and salty. I had 3 tacos with homemade tortillas. Chorizo was really good and not a bit of grease. Pastor delicious and the carnitas was also good. Slightly dry but thats ok they give you very flavorful sauces to put on it! The grilled jalapeño was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Awesome little spot for legit tacos.  Definitely go for the homemade tortilla option on the tacos. I had a chorizo taco and the torta milanesa.  The torta was huge with plenty of ingredients.  Salsas are all delicious.  Service was excellent!

Our server spoke great English so if you are a gringo like me then don't be concerned... just go in and grab a seat.  Order some tacos  and pay at the counter when you leave."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review prematurely. There's no way I can get a seat in this place. There were no Americans to be seen. That's a good sign. The smells were amazing. Lots of garlic. Even the smell of cilantro didn't bother me that much. Right now they're going to get five stars which may change once I taste their food which will be soon.  Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"I still very much enjoy a weekly visit to this place. Food is consistently good. After several years of coming here I know I'll still be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Great place, actual Mexico Mexican food.  Lengua, menudo, no one speaks English my kind of place!"}
{"text":"I don't know why Gastonia has so many \"sit and be waited on\" LatAm restaurants, and just a few humble tacquerias. I agree with other reviewers, if you're looking for a place like this, it'll meet your expectations. You can get some genuine items inexpensively and they have a modest menu that goes beyond the usual tacos and burritos.

The ambiance of being in the back of a long building, with no windows, makes it feel a bit hole-in-the-wall ... but the seats and tables are tidy. If you're an anglo the staff will speak to you in English first. As a humble family kitchen, it serves it's niche here just fine."}
