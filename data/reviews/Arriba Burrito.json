{"text":"Visited Montreal from Texas and found this little gem on yelp. Two cute cousins were working that night and were very friendly and even let me practice my Spanish with them. That made this Texan feel at ease and at home when I was so far from it. 
Ordered chicken tacos and they were delicious and the price was right. They cook them
In front of you and ask what toppings you want. No waiter or b/s reservations. 
If you like tacos or burritos, check this place out. I will be back next time I'm in that part of town. Arriba arriba."}
{"text":"Shrimp burrito excellent but alittle over priced.
Steak tacos are almost as good too.
Guacamole is not extra.

Uber eats! Wish they delivered later than 10 through,"}
{"text":"Best burrito in Montreal. We've tried them all, hands down, this is your spot. The variety of wraps and the homemade chips are fantastic. Super fresh, huge portions, we got loaded steak burritos for ten bucks a pop. Bring an appetite!!"}
{"text":"The tacos are amazingly good. Great tasty food. I enjoyed the tacos al pastor. Definitely recommend to anyone craving great Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Delicious burrito close to home! 

Good news when I walked in - they were offering burritos for $5 with a Facebook like! Otherwise, the chicken burrito was listed for 8.95 which seems a bit steep. But it was good!

I asked for almost all of the toppings on the burrito, with a medium salsa. The burrito was put on a grill and served piping hot! All the toppings were nicely blended as a result of the heat.

Other reviewers note a lot of new burrito places in the area and, having just moved here, I can't comment on how this one compares, but I thought it was the real deal.

One word of caution - it was HOT in there! It would have been difficult to eat in, so you may want to plan for take out!"}
{"text":"Very good burrito! Sour cream and guacamole are free of charge :) Will come back next time for the tacos!"}
{"text":"This place makes great, fresh burritos. It is a great place for tacos and burritos in the area. I have only had the burritos and they are made custom for you when you order. When I ordered my steak burrito they cooked the steak fresh and built my burrito once the meat was ready. Fresh ingredients and a pretty fast service makes it a regular go to in my area. On Mont Royal you would think the prices would be more expensive but even the prices are reasonable. Need a good burrito hit fast and reasonably priced...this is your place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm always hesitant to eat Mexican food anywhere outside of California because that's one thing we know how to do. Having lived in New Zealand and having to shell out $20 for a tiny organic burrito...yeah, that just left a bad taste in my mouth for trying Mexican food overseas.

Apparently, Montreal is slapping me upside the head for my closed minded thoughts. This place is LEGIT!!!  We ordered the veggie burrito and the tacos al pastor...just heavenly!  I love that they don't even ask you mild, medium, or spicy. You just eat it how it's given to you. Just like mamma would.  I would not have it any other way and it was the perfect amount of kick.  The tortillas seems like they are fresh and homemade. If there weren't people around, I would have licked my plate.

Do yourself a favor and try this place. Add a Mexican Coke (yes, there is a huge difference) with your order and you're golden."}
{"text":"Found this little hole in the wall Mexican place on my way back from the metro. Very cozy and warm, though the space is tiny so it's better for take out if you're coming with a large group of people. 

Ordered the pork burrito with everything on it (and spicy salsa). DELISH! The ingredients and flavors are well balanced and it really does taste authentic (coming from someone who has relatives from Mexico and has tasted many homemade dishes). The food came very fast, as the people prepare it in front of you and then grill it and serve it to you piping hot. Not a drop spilled out of the foil wrapping either!

A great find as well as finding a little side store too, where they sell imported Mexican foods and sweets (even fresh tomatillos!) 

I am definately going to order the tacos next time...and bringing a few friends along too!"}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, when I saw that another burrito/taco place was opening in the Plateau, my soul died a little. We're averaging about one every 400m now. But then I ordered a pork burrito with just about every topping you could think of (no lie, the person at the counter must have put 10 toppings on, and that wasn't even the full offering), and I understood why they decided to open up shop. If anything deserved to replace the old Kouign Amann, this is it. I'm not saying their burritos are as good as Kouign Amann's croissants, because nothing is as good as Kouign Amann's croissants, but they do make me equally happy."}
{"text":"It's a cute little place that mostly serves tacos and burritos and nachos. The service is friendly, the food is great and their prices will pleasantly surprise you. 

Definitely worth checking it out. You order at the counter and your food is ready in about 5 minutes, they also sell different varieties of corn chips and salsa if I'm not mistaken.

If you're on a budget or in a hurry, then I would definitely recommend this resto-shop."}
{"text":"Amazing pork burrito!  One of the best burritos I have ever had.  The salsa is also fantastic.  Nachos were mediocre."}
{"text":"I tried the vegetarian tofu burrito today because I had too much meat over the weekend. This was delicious, unexpected from a place with mainly burrito with meat on the menu. There's a creamy spicy sauce that really bonded everything together, the tofu was nothing special but it's the mixture of ingredients that made it a juicy saucy not dry and very fresh ingredients based burrito. Ask for the medium spicy green sauce when they served to me it was still warm perfectly spicy you won't walked out of there feeling burned by spice. The taste is very well balanced."}
{"text":"Ok guys, we finally have a decent burrito place on Mont-Royal and I could not be happier and thankful for the awesome people that work at this place. Latino music was playing (Aventura) as I entered to order a Cochinita burrito and it was quite good. However, the burritos were not wrapped tightly which led me to making a mess but I didn't't mind too much. This place is definitely worth checking out. Oh, one more thing I feel they could improve a bit on their Cochinita as it lacked flavor. I'll come back soon and try again :) I now leave with burrito craving satisfied, leaving me free to enjoy some drinks."}
