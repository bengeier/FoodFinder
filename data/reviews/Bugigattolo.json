{"text":"Came on my birthday with my boyfriend on a Saturday night and recently found out that they had just started to do dinner service on the weekends in 2016. The place is small--can sit roughly 18/20 people inside the restaurant, so it may seem cramped or overwhelming having to share close corners with other diners.   We started out with the Cured Meat sharing platter (not shown on the menu online, however, suggested by the waitress) We enjoyed the platter but noticed the other diners having the similar sharing platter but with cured meats. It wasn't until we were finished that the meats were missing so the waitress was able to take a deduction off our bill. (Note to self: remember the cured meats! They looked delicious) We also shared the prosciutto pizza and it was like a bite from Italy. Although my boyfriend and I are not cultured in terms of Italian food, the waitress was patient enough to help explain the menu and help with the confusion. A big plus was how affordable and inexpensive the meal overall was!    The food alone was good but the service is what really makes this place worth it. Right when you walk in, you're greeted by the waitress and the chef. They take your jackets and make sure you feel welcomed. This night in particular, the oven apparently broke down so it took over an hour for the food (the prosciutto pizza to be specific) to come. My boyfriend and I were in no rush so we didn't seem to notice how long the wait was until the waitress kept apologizing to us--offering us an extra drink and sides (such as mini meatballs) on the house. Even the chef came up to us to apologize for the wait. Typically, waiting that long for a pizza we would've gone up and left, however, the service and friendly manner they gave us made us stay and wait.   After our food arrived and we were about to get the bill, the waitress offered us a complimentary espresso and a slice of tiramisu. You can't control what happens to the equipment of the kitchen, but you can control the service you give to your patrons. So the service is well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Kitchen is really dirty and I lost my appetite right after I got there. I never feel like eating a food which is made such a dirty place."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant for a birthday party and was very excited about the concept.  I love when the chef chooses what to cook that evening because it gives them the freedom to cook deliciously fresh, in season dishes and I trust that they'll cook their best. Spoiler alert, it's only a good thing if the chef actually knows what he's doing and if the restaurant can handle the number of people in your party.   Despite our reservation being at 9 pm, when we arrived many of the restaurants seats were taken. We were told there was a 'bit' of a delay. I guess a 'bit' to this restaurant is an hour and a half because we weren't seated until 10:30. Even then, several people had to remain standing and wait until the other patrons left. When they finally did leave, our party was split up, with some having to sit at the bar. Those at the bar received less dishes than those at the table.  The food began to arrive around 11, each dish more disappointing than the last. It was all ice cold and I'm sure  may have been decent if it had been warm but we'll never know. Around 12, the staff brings out an extra table magically appearing out of thin air that allowed the rest of the party to join the larger group. Where had this table been? Why had it taken so long to get it? As far as I know, we were the only customers at the restaurant so apparently our discomfort was so insignificant to the staff it did not even cross their minds that there was a solution to the lack of seating.   By 1:30 am we received our last dish. At this point I believe everyone in the party had lost their appetite. Apparently the staff had decided not to serve us this dish and one member of the party had to directly ask for it from the chef who was outside smoking.   At the end of the night the bill, a laughable 120.00 per person, was given to us. An insane amount considering the portions alone and the quality of the food. We were told they could not give us an itemized bill (suspicious).  We paid and left trying to escape this place as quickly as possible. I'm sure the staff are still laughing at the amount they made off our party for the joke that was this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for lunch here today and they were not open despite signs and website saying the open at 11(sign outside) and 11:30(on website)"}
{"text":"food is as good as it gets. SO intimate and it is the loveliest place to go and spend hours eating and talking. really one of my favourite places in the city. i cannot wait for the patio to open"}
{"text":"What an incredible, intimate hidden treasure. We are so lucky to live in Toronto because of locations like this. You will become a regular if you've never been...Nothing but great things to say about the wonderful food and fabulous service. Italians always do it better. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hard to tell...but this place might actually be closed down now.  The phone seems to be disconnected and hasn't opened up in weeks."}
{"text":"Arrived for lunch with some friends. No tables but we sat at the bar/cooking area. We were told that a table was going to be available in a few minutes. We waited about 15 - 20 minutes before realizing that we were probably going to have to eat at the bar so we ordered our food which was a bit of a drawn out process. Lasagna arrived first for two of my friends which I was told was good but lukewarm at best. Meatball sandwich came for my other friend next. It looked really good but I was told meatballs were stone cold. I ordered the BMT with a fried egg. Really just a sandwich. It never came. I was not very impressed and I made it known. I honestly have no problem complaining about poor service or bad food. It's really my right as a customer, so I complained for everyone. I didn't really want an apology because to me there is no excuse. They had almost an hour to make me a sandwich. Yes it was busy but the place barely holds 18 people. Plus some dude who walked in after us got his takeout order and left. The girl working there was useless to me and the \"cook\" didn't know what he was doing. He tried to blame it on the fact that he was training someone. It is my understanding that there is an actual chef that works there or co-owns the resto. He wasn't there. I'm sure if he was I would have enjoyed my food. Such a shame because I was so looking forward to eating there and like anything else in this city, is totally overrated and run by people who don't know the meaning of customer service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hugger! The tiny dining room envelops you without feeling claustrophobic, the food is as warming as an embrace, the patrons are all friendly and approachable and sitting so close its easy to blur the lines between your table and theirs! And the friendly staff literally hugs all their customers.   This was not a meal, it was an experience! Unexpected dishes emerging from the kitchen, each one simply constructed yet both challenging and pleasing to the palate. Small plates, big flavour, all heart. Go."}
{"text":"This place had an enticing proposition from the get go as far as the concept it is interesting the chef comes to talk to you and picks and chooses things from the daily offerings. Two choices of wines i.e. one red and one white!  We tried to reserve via Yelp app but darn no short notice reservations yet by yelp. Had to call in to reserve, it was right around the time they were opening up so had no trouble getting a seat on a weekday. We were greeted warmly and after a little wait the chef showed up table side and discussed the menu (kudos for recognizing a fellow diner who had tried the spot a few months earlier) We did have a few restrictions on the food so its a great idea to talk with the chef first. First course: Burschetta on toast two way. Sun dried tomato on one and other had pesto. Cheese was very fresh and it showed. Decent start. Buffalo mozerralla with tomatoes and bread. Again fresh simple ingredients and done minimally so boded well Fritters (Zucchini) and Arachini (saffron rissotto) Both done very well. Kudos for elevating a simple dish. Gnocchi: We were asked to choose a spice level so we ordered it with a kick. Simple dish again though I didn't quite enjoy it myself as am not a fan Egg Plant Lasagne: Very nicely done. Layers of pasta with minimal sauce and bits of egg plant. Simple dish. No dessert offering sadly that day I would say 3.5 stars but for a somewhat reasonable price for a whole bunch of food a half star bump. Having been disappointed with similar food at a well regarded place recently (not to mention almost double the cost) I would recommend visiting this place if you like this approach to food."}
{"text":"I went here about a week ago for the 7-course Chef's Table and it has taken me this long to come to terms with the price I paid for dinner (oh, student budgets...) but this recently opened \"hole in the wall\" (as the Italian name denotes) was remarkable. The location feels like a home - fits 18 people (+ outdoor patio but mosquitoes!!) and serves up homemade Italian fare (truly - they won't feed you bread from the day before) prepared by Chef Francesco and the delightful staff. What struck me about the place was the excellent service - many patrons were called by name, and customers new or old were treated like family. Despite moving to different tables three times, Diego (our main server) was warm, friendly and humble (he mentioned the place opened just last year and that there are many other great Italian places in the city - so modest!).   Among the highlights of the meal were a flawless cannolini (smooth perfection), what I believe was a lasagna alla zucchine, pesto pizza, and a flaky and soft tiramisu. The chef even offered to make our table our favourite pasta with our choice of sauce - amazing! The servers and chef will talk to you, make jokes, provide context for your dishes, and keep you entertained all evening! The only part I didn't enjoy was a purple cabbage salad, but apart from this dish everything I had was excellent. Bugigattolo is also very accommodating of dietary restrictions, which is lovely! If you prefer not to opt for the Chef's Table (the items of which change every night, I believe!), there is a full à la carte menu at your disposal as well. Overall, an outsanding experience - my first five-star review :)"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin. The food is delicious. The service is impeccable. Being able to chat with the chef is always amazing. You can head in and order off the menu, or you can chat with the chef and see what he has available for you that day. All of the flavours were perfect, from the salad to the pasta to the desserts."}
{"text":"Feels like home when you walk in!!!!  We sat out in their beautiful patio and waited a while but just had drinks and weren't in a rush so whatever...   Eventually, the chef Francesco came out to greet us and they didn't have menus that he was going to just bring us food.  Sounds excellent!  Asked if we have any allergies - to which we had none.  Bring on the food. All 6 courses please!  We started off with PROSCIUTTO AND ARGULA PIZZA.  This pizza was stacked!!! He did not skimp on the materials, everything tastes fresh even the salt sprinkled on it!!  Then, he brought us this FRESH BREAD AND CHEESE PLATE WITH CHARCUTERIE. It was amazing, all tasted so fresh and topped with fresh figs and honey- delish.  Now comes the BRUSCHETTA TOPPED WITH FRESH TOMATOES AND BASIL.  Oh my goodness, the freshness of all the ingredients. We were starting to get full but not obnoxiously full.   Mid course, he gave us a digestif. RADICCHIO WITH BALSAMIC. Was bitter but tasty was a good meal cutter from all the cheese and heavy meats.  Then the pasta . We had EGGPLANT BAKED PASTA TOPPED WITH FRESH PARMESAN. It was sooooooooooooo tasty in a tomato sauce that was made from fresh tomatoes.  Finally, the DESSERT. Little ALMOND BISCUITS with ESPRESSO. So sweet and such a great way to end the dinner.  Francesco was always kind, always came out to greet us and just chat. Said the philosophy of his restaurant was to strive to allow people to socialize at dinner like back home. The ambiance was amazing and the staff were super friendly, definitely one of the best dining experiences in Toronto. You don't even know how much you're going to pay, I guess it's by how much you ate?  We paid about $100 for 2 people, no alcohol, the experience and the quality of food was amazing.   Salute!"}
{"text":"Bugigattolo (Boo-gee-GAH-toh-low) means \"hole in the wall\" in Italian, an apt name for their small, cozy space. They don't have a dinner menu, opting instead for a $45 chef's table, although they have a small menu available for lunch. There's a lovely patio in the back with lights strung up and jazz playing that distracts from the graffitied brick walls of their neighbours.  The meal started with a Caprese salad, featuring cherry tomatoes and a delicious burrata. Other courses included a small prosciutto pizza and ricotta on toasts. There was also a pizza fritta, which was a deep fried ball of dough sliced open and stuffed with cured meat and spicy pickled peppers. The main course was a choice of either penne alla norma (eggplant) or puttanesca. Curiously, the chef's table ended with the pasta and didn't include dessert.  The staff here are friendly and approachable, and the chef often came out to chat with diners and ask about the food. Overall, I appreciated the respect given to the ingredients, allowing them to stand on their own without being laden with unnecessary seasonings. However, I could not help to feel a bit dissatisfied upon leaving. The quantity of food wasn't small, but it certainly was not substantial. While none of the dishes were poor, the meal as a whole was unremarkable. I had high hopes for Bugigattolo, with its charming space, charming staff, and charmingly difficult to pronounce/spell name, but the food fell short of expectations."}
{"text":"Came for a media event to celebrate the opening of Bugigattolo.   Got to try some pasta dishes like the Lasagna alla Bolognese and Margherita pizza. Margherita being my favourite.   The place is a small, 25 capacity. During winter they have a small back space with heater and during summer, I expect their patio will be a hit. They are still working on their liquor licence so don't expect a full drinks menu until January 2016.   I would suggest owners also update their online map with specific directions. I came on a dark rainy night with my friend and we were wondering around for a bit lost despite using google map."}
{"text":"I'm hesitant to write this review because of my inherent selfishness and desire for this restaurant to remain under the radar, should the hoards of TO food enthusiasts descend upon it once it gains it's following and it subsequently requires reservations months in advance. This however conflicts with my instinct to shout about most good dining experiences that I'm lucky enough to have and therefore I choose to humbly serve Bugigattolo Kitchen (as they have served me delicious Italian food) through hopefully contributing to their growth and ultimately to a happier Toronto - and world.   For my second visit to the restaurant (my first was a brunch visit weeks ago, in which the service and food was equally impressive), I made reservations for my partner and I for Valentine's Day dinner. Instead of an a la carte menu, the kitchen had prepared an evening that included 7 courses consisting of small shareable plates (mozzarella and prosciutto, frittata, arancini, foccacia and ricotta, pizza, and more) to begin and culminating in a main course of a rich lasagna, lamb stew and gnocchi. Attention and careful consideration was taken by the kitchen for every course, the food and ingredients were fresh, deliciously crafted, and throughout the meal the staff kept us in the know about what was coming, asking us about our preferences on customizable details and how things were tasting. This kind of attention to our experience as diners is completely unprecedented, especially in Toronto where amazing food is available around every corner, but a truly unique dining experience is hard to come by.   To finish, the staff provided tiramisu and coffee, as well as a few small special touches for Valentine's Day. All in all a fantastic dining experience in a small and cozy restaurant tucked away from the bustle of Toronto's main streets. Thank you Bugigattolo Kitchen for making our Valentine's Day such a memorable one, and I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Great service and very accommodating to tastes. My fav was the arancini and mussels. The chef was super friendly and made our orders to our preferences. I'd love to go back to see what other dishes of the day are available."}
{"text":"Happily, rumors of this wonderful cafe's demise are untrue!  The owner has confirmed they are, indeed, still open."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a while. We were celebrating our 3 year anniversary and wanted to try something new but not pretentious and this place was perfect. Everything is house made and fresh. We had their arancini, meatballs, kale salad, zucchini lasagna (al dente and super creamy), and pizza with fiore di latte - all delicious. They can make substations to your taste (unlike terroni. Service was outstanding and welcoming. I honestly have nothing to complain about this place. Even the coffee and cannoli were good. Such a nice neighbourhood gem!"}
{"text":"Came here on a rainy night right after landing at Pearson Airport (and in the mood for good Italian food on 9pm) -- best. choice. ever!!! We basically chose a place on Yelp at random, and ended up being very surprised by this small, cozy Italian restaurant.  As others have mentioned, the menu changes daily and the chef handpicks the offerings for your table -- go over allergies, how hungry you are, etc. It was such a nice change from other restaurants and we really enjoyed how fresh, simple, and perfect the portions were. The kale salad and mascarpone pizza were our favorites/highlights of the night. Tiramisu on the house didn't hurt either :)   Maybe it's because we're from San Francisco/bay area, but the price tag was the most exceptional part: $40 for 4 people? Blew us out of the water. Would totally recommend, for a date night or just a casual get together for friends. Thank you and we're definitely going to try to come back before we leave Toronto!!"}
{"text":"Finally, with the opening of Bugigattolo Kitchen, a cozy and intimate 'hole in the wall' spot graces the busy streets of Liberty Village.  Bugigattolo literally means 'hole in the wall', which perfectly suits this authentic Italian kitchen nestled away on 54 Fraser Ave.  From the outside, I could barely tell that I was walking towards a restaurant until I saw the sign painted upon the layered bricks. The inside is quite small and it definitely reminded me of one of the many cicchetti bars I wandered into while visiting Venice this past summer. The inside sits 18 people, but there is also a 25 seat back-patio that is heated and covered for the colder months.  Bugigattolo aims to change the food game in Liberty Village by providing the community with eclectic Southern Italian fare, a certain contrast to the very pub-grub ridden locale that currently exists. Executive chef, Quin Josey, has put together a detailed menu full of pizzas, pastas, paninis, soups, salads, pastries and much more.   I went to the media launch of Bugigattolo so I had the chance to try many different food items from the menu.  Italian food is one of my favourites, so I was really excited to see what they had to offer.  My favourite dishes were the Pasta alla Birra and the Butternut Squash Soup.  The Pasta alla Birra was rich, creamy and absolutely delicious. I loved the gracious amount of parm and black pepper sprinkled on top to really enhance this dish. The butternut squash soup was one of the best I've ever tasted.  I have no idea how they perfected this soup, but they did and it's something I would come back here for, time and time again, especially on a chilly day.  Each dish I tried was quite tasty and thankfully nothing disappointed. I did wish that we had a chance to sample some of the desserts, but I will make sure to try a cannoli or two on my next visit.  If you're looking for a different taste in Liberty Village, I highly recommend popping by Bugigattolo for authentic eats, unpretentious clientele, and a warm and welcoming ambiance.  Bugigattolo is currently open for full day breakfast and lunch (8 am to 6 pm) and will be open for dinner starting January 2016"}
{"text":"Food and service are excellent. Their eggplant pasta and tiramisu are delicious! They will be opening a patio in the summer too (on the 2nd floor I believe). I was there is mid February and loved the place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service - simple but careful and definitely worth the wait. I went in this morning for a coffee and an Uova Affogato (a poached egg with ricotta and n'duja on toasted ciabatta). It was my first time at Bugigattolo but Francesco and Tricia treated me like I was a regular. The other customers were just as chatty and friendly, which highlighted the cozy neighbourhood cafe atmosphere.  The ciabatta hadn't arrived yet and Francesco didn't want to stick me with the day-old bread. I had the choice between returning when the bread was in, or going with another entree. Francesco helpfully suggested alternatives without any pressure. Then, as I considered ordering an Alla N'duja pizza for an early lunch (why not, right?), he offered to add an egg to it. Now it would be an Alla N'duja Alla Bismark - brunch pizza! - and it sounded fantastic.  It tasted fantastic as well. I had the pleasure of watching it being made, almost like a cooking lesson. Francesco explained what he was doing differently with this pizza versus the Uova Affogato (making the ricotta creamier, mixing it with the n'duja, adding fior di latte upon my agreement). While the pizza was being made I had a great Americano and a delicious cannoli. I admired all the family photos and telegrams posted to one of the walls.  When the pizza was done, Francesco topped it off with fresh basil, black pepper and salt. Beautiful. Was I at Bugigattolo longer than expected? Sure, but what an experience (and if I'm in a rush in the future, I'll see if I can place my order by phone before heading over to the restaurant). I will certainly be back - and if you haven't gone there yet, you should."}
{"text":"We had a private dinner for a friends bday.  They gave us the Venue for a late dinner. This place was incredible. Amazing food. (The pizza balls, are you kidding me ?!) First class service. I can't think of a better place for a private party. Need to come back for a dinner/date."}
