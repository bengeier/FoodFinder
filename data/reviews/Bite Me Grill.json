{"text":"Fast friendly filling and the food is fine. Nothing exceptional about the place; it is bright and fresh and clean but a bit antiseptic. The potatoes are better than average but the omelettes are cooked on a griddle that is too hot so the eggs are a bit tough. Coffee is hot and free-flowing but a bit watery.  Prices are reasonable for the quantity, although reflecting the mediocre quality."}
{"text":"Service is so slow!  Stay away from this place unless you like waiting for an hour for scrambled eggs."}
{"text":"don't eat here! don't waste your time or money! i ordered a smoothie with my meal that arrived at the end. the food was tasteless, the toast over done and dry! she never checked on me, as it would have been nice to have jam. i expressed my disappointment and the loss of my appetite. i was still charged full price for a meal i couldn't finish. disgusting service!"}
{"text":"The decor is very fresh and suits a breakfast place. It's very open and spacious with lots of natural light. The food quality is pretty low, so I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"For the $6.50 I got 2 Eggs, 2 Bacons, 2 Sausages and some home fries. No room to complain here! Server was kind and the food was like home. Definitely a go to when in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place, the breakfasts are fantastic, food is delicious. The manager/owner and staff are very nice. I love the Greek omelette however everything is tasty."}
{"text":"I love to go to the bite me restaurant. The food is great, affordable, fantastic service, with parking in the rear."}
{"text":"Watched owner/cook sample Hollandaise from pot w spoon and then return spoon to pot twice. Enough said."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. A must to check out and eat. Would strongly recommend. The portions are a good size and at a great price. A real treat to go on the Danforth."}
{"text":"We had their chicken souvlaki during Taste of the Danforth and it was good. They had a lively atmosphere and their souvlaki was tasty!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout, they didn't bring one item I ordered. When I called they didn't answer. Luckily I order on JustEat or else I wouldn't have got my money back! So, called JustEat, they called and told them to send my one item they forgot. They didn't come! Called JustEat again and got my money back! My item was 10 dollars too, no way am I over looking that! Rude service = never again."}
{"text":"Amazing, is the only word I can use. I was so hungry I dived in without taking a photo. Pancakes were the best thing here, they were the size of my head!"}
