{"text":"Great new restaurant in Orleans casino. Servers are great and friendly (especially Deni). Quality of food is excellent and prices are... Worth it! Visited 2 days in a row and there is nothing to complain about. I will be back again!!"}
{"text":"This reminds me of the old Koji's.  The food and service is great.  I wasn't too happy with the wait time.  I made a reservation for a larger group according to the time the hostess said seating would be available.  We were still waiting to be seated 40 minutes after the time she gave me.  Not a happy camper at all!!  Hungry people, few of our party left because they could not wait!  We were so hungry we ordered our main meal.  We will usually order some sushi and have a few drinks but this was not the case this time..which is too bad we loved the sushi at Koji's.  Maybe next year they will get it right!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and the food was very delicious!  Deni was our server and he was awesome! Very nice and attentive the whole time my boyfriend and I was there.  He answered whatever questions we had about the food especially when we had trouble picking out what sake to drink.  We ordered Chokara (a type of sake) and the Lobster in Black Bean Sauce, which he recommended, and we loved it very much.  We would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Fast service and great people. I've eaten here three times now and all of the experiences were exceptional. I always ate at the bar since I was in Vegas alone on business. During two of the visits TK was working and he was amazing. If you're going to eat at the bar then come on a night that he is there. TK was very personable, knowledgeable, and definitely knew how to take care of his customers. He even recognized me after only the second time seeing me; and it had been a few weeks between visits! Their menu has a wide range in choices too, so you can find some great deals in there. Ondori is definitely worth checking out if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"It's always a lot better when I get good service and food, thank you mike and anthony"}
{"text":"Be careful of your Credit Card Charges. We dined here in June 2016 and a week later checked our Credit card to find we had been charged twice for the meal, tried to call, but ended up having to make a trip down to the restaurant and speak to the Manager who was unable to do anything until she spoke to another manager, and asked us to come back later. Very poor service, we are very very disappointed. I would expect a restaurant of this 'standard' to not make these types of totally unprofessional mistakes. So be careful people, check those credit cards if you dine here."}
{"text":"The old Koji used to be good, when they make the new decor and fancy look, the food and services went downhill.   I frequent previously this place as Koji, the duck were pricey $35 plus tax, but at times worth it when it was cook right. It almost feel like playing roulette. You have to gamble to see who cooks your meal. Ondori, thumbs down!  If you sit down to eat to order a whole duck, they will bring you a fresh duck but missing some pieces of drumstick. I used to visit every week to take my business clientele to try out, foods did turn out so so, missing the WOW factor, but the flavor of duck and seafood hot pot are inconsistent each time we ordered.  Then if you do a take out which I did on 10/31/2016 for my family treats, the duck was day old rubber ball and gammie. I guessed they don't care too much of returning customer's experience."}
{"text":"Some friends and I came after a movie and Ondori hit the spot! The Japanese and Chinese food provided a lot of options when we ordered and they offer more than the typical take out menu. We ordered the orange chicken, combination fried rice, dragon roll, and Mongolian beef, and several other sushi rolls. All of them went beyond our expectations! They taste like more than you would usually expect from their traditional recipes and the proportions are super satisfying. You could tell the sushi was fresh and we enjoyed watching the chef prepare our rolls. June was an amazing waiter! He had a great attitude and accommodated to all of our needs regardless of how small. He offered great recommendations and we will be requesting him again the next time we come, which will definitely be soon."}
{"text":"I agree with Thomas O. about charging $5 for takeout food if not $50 or above--pretty high for a single person! This is whether it's credit, room charge or cash. I ate here last night, dining in and spent $30. Tonight it was late, so I wanted to order and take it to my room. Your prices are high enough without tacking on such a ridiculous, absurd  charge. I won't be back, and neither should you! You lost out on more, multiple purchases from me. Talk about taking away business from yourself."}
{"text":"BBQ pork, Beef noodle soup, and fish fillet with bitter melon.    For my first visit I was quite surprised.  A little pricy but I will be back."}
{"text":"Great service, food and happy hour!  We love coming here during our yearly Vegas stay at The Orleans!"}
{"text":"Great service! We sat at the sushi bar, sushi was fresh and delicious! We had miso soup, shrimp tempura, yellowtail, tuna and the who's your daddy roll. Definitely coming back again"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food, nice decor & environment.  We tried seafood poke, roast duck, beef stew and beef shank noodle soups, chicken wrap, all turned out great.  Only the won ton soup was disappointing."}
{"text":"Food was salty , their sushi was disappointing. They fall apart so easily. Diamond back roll was ok . Service was friendly and fast ."}
{"text":"We were at the Orleans on a Friday night around 6pm to see a show at the Orleans Arena and thought some sushi sounded awesome. Didn't have reservations and on a time crunch but they did fit us in and I'm glad they did!!!  We had the baked Mussels appetizer and it was AWESOME.... 5 nice sized and extremely flavorful mussels that the wife and I both LOVED, we also shared the Burning Night Roll which was spicy and tasty, really good !!  I had some Sake and she a Lychee Martini..... we were satiated and done in time to get to the show and the entire bill was less than $50 with tip. Thought it was great.... some of the snooty \"not authentic Asian\" reviews on here  seem a bit out of line to me.... go and enjoy !!!"}
{"text":"Had the crispy sea bass, amazing texture but the sauce was horrible, so we used the sweet and sour sauce.  The Peking duck was a little more fatty than crispy, and the peking sauce was not that good.  The honey walnut shrimp needed more honey.  The beef chow fun was perfect, the spare ribs were not tender enough and seems like it was not cooked long enough.  The wonton soup was blan..."}
{"text":"Deni is the best!!  He's one of the many excellent servers here but he stands out as super attentive, friendly and kind.  So, if you're able to stop in for a meal, ask for Deni. He will help make your meal a wonderful experience.  We always try to ask for Deni and always have great service with a happy smile.  :)   This used to be Koji and they moved from the other side of the casino floor.  The new space is much larger and really pretty with simple but still interesting decor.  It's relaxed and doesn't get any smoke off the casino floor.  A big plus in my book.  Ok, now, onto the food.  Our favorites are the Seafood and Tofu Hotpot, Singapore Rice noodles, both plain stir fried and curry style, and the salmon skin rolls from the sushi bar.  We love that we can get both Japanese and Chinese food so there's something for everyone.  Both styles are done right.  The Bento Boxes are new on the menu and they are loaded with food.  It's really enough for two people.  For a tasty meal with caring and attentive service, give Ondori, formerly Koji, a try, and don't forget to ask for Deni."}
{"text":"3 stars for food and food alone.   This review is mainly about their new take-out policy of charging $2.50 on to go orders less than $50 and $5 on to go orders above $50 on all cash and credit card orders! Orders where players use comps or points they will charge 25cents for each ITEM ordered.   I am in shock. When I followed up with the manager on the way out, he pointed to my to go bag and said \"you have $1 in boxes and bags right there\". Um... Seriously??? How does that fall on the customer's shoulders? Shouldn't that be figured into the overhead cost of running a restaurant and if needed raise the prices behind the scenes. How in a customer service town where many people take food back to their rooms or eat at the poker tables are you going to tell them they need to pay for a box, a bag, silverware, soy sauce...  I'm appalled by this and feel it should be addressed."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great meal in Ondori. Walter was our server and he did a fantastic job. We were a party of seven and shared seven Chinese entrees. The food was amazing. Highly reccomend."}
{"text":"LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT! Everything is so fresh & full of flavor! Awesome fast friendly service! ;)  Give it a try! I've had the rice & noodle dishes. Want to come back for their seafood next time! :)"}
{"text":"This place was a HUGE disappointment, we were having our sushi craving and this place DID NOT DELIVER. We checked this place out while we were staying at the Orleans on our last Vegas trip. The place is beautifully decorated. There were about 2 tables of 3 and 4 ppl each, not crowded at all. It was so dead the sushi chef was just standing behind the counter with his arms folded. We were sat immediately, it took a long time for someone to take our drink order, then a long time for our actual waiter to take our food order. We made sure to order our regular asian favs that are standard fare for an asian restaurant. It would not have been so bad if the food didnt suck so much. It didnt even look appetizing, they could have at the least dressed up the plate with some lettuce or used smaller plates, the plates were huge with the food sitting in the middle. Wont be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious..... BBQ pork buns, Dumplings, Shrimp Tempura.... Great service by Pancho...."}
{"text":"We just had Wor Wonton Soup, Mongolian beef and Chicken Lo Mein and it was amazingly delicious. Deni our server was friendly and attentive. If you're in the LV area, this restaurant is an absolute must. Did I mention the beautiful decor?  Enjoy."}
{"text":"A snack before bowling and Casey remembered us!!  It has been a year and I didn't think we were memorable.  We had fried rice and a drink...Casey's sangria is still fantastic and my husband had a pumpkin spice latte martini and claimed it really good.  If you are in the area...stop by and say hey to Casey!   (Posting this in the am, stopped by last evening)."}
{"text":"Located in the back of the casino, past the table games, to the right of the cafe, below the prime rib restaurant.   Came here for the first time on a Sunday evening with two friends who were sisters. They had arrived a little before i did but we sat at a corner booth in the back dining room. 2nd time we came on a Saturday night and had 1-2 more people so we had a bigger booth in the middle of the dining room.   Decor is pretty simple but nice. Definitely the Chinese style but at least not too overpowering. Small sushi bar to the left with a bar to the right before entering the main dining room in the back.   The girls have been here before so i essentially let them order most of it.   Sashimi Special (Three-piece sashimi of tuna, yellowtail, salmon, white fish, albacore and octopus.) Very fresh fish though a bit thinly sliced compared to other places in terms of sashimi. All were good. Octopus was a mildly chewy, but could be worse.   Sushi and Sashimi Special (The following are served as a two-piece sashimi and one-piece sushi: tuna, yellowtail, salmon, snapper, albacore and octopus) The sashimi is as above but 1 piece less. The sushi (nigiri) was far from good. The rice seemed quite mushy and formed by like a rice former then cut to logs.   Minced Chicken Lettuce Wrap - Very tasty dish with flavorful minced chicken wrapped with butter lettuce. Surprising they use butter lettuce versus iceberg lettuce, but im not complaining. Butter lettuce is tastier than iceberg in my opinion. Comes with a side of hoisin sauce and some fried things to add on top for some crunch texture. Nice appetizer to share to wet the appetite with something savory ! Comes with like 5 leaves of lettuce  Salt and Pepper Pork - flavorful, tender fried salt and pepper pork with fried garlic and sliced jalapeno chili.   Salt and Pepper Squid - unlike the pork, this was quite unflavored. Lots of batter. My friend used her soy sauce with wasabi from the sushi/sashimi for a dipping sauce for this. It actually was pretty good idea. I used it too XD   Pork Jowl Meat with Fresh Mushroom and XO Sauce - Various mushrooms like oyster mushroom and button mushroom cooked with a good amount of pork jowl meat. Jowl is essentially the cheek. Very marbleized fatty piece of meat that is very limited per animal. Flavorful dish.   Ma Po Tofu Chinese Style (Soft white tofu blocks mixed with peas and carrots in brown sauce) - A very mild dish, almost borderline Americanized. Traditional Mapo tofu should be spicy and numbing. Not have peas and carrots. This had no spice. Tofu itself was soft and yummy though. Rest was a bit weird.   Oxtail Pot (Tender oxtail bathed in sweet red wine with bean curd sticks) - Very tender oxtail cooked in a sweet red wine sauce with fried tofu and bean curd sticks. Delicious dish. All the meat is essentially falling off the bone. Great with rice ! or noodles !   Beef Brisket Pot - similar sauce to the oxtail pot except with brisket and beef tendon. If only the oxtail pot had beef tendon... XD Was good too ! Its like a boneless version of oxtail.   Green Beans with XO Sauce - the first time i had it, it was good. second time, its either they forgot to use seasoning or they didn't use enough XO sauce. I know XO is kind of pricey but don't put so little, the dish is bland. I think the green beans were not cooked twice either.   Hot Tea (Jasmine, Green, Oolong) - Always had gotten Oolong. 2 tea bags per pot. Surprisingly those tea bags gives a good amount of flavor. Don't know why I drink so much tea the few times i've been here. Friend is starting to hate me for having to refill my cup so often !   Mochi Ice Cream Platter (Mango, Strawberry, Green Tea) - Each platter comes with 1 mochi of each flavor, cut in half. Mochi is soft and mildly chewy. Yummy dessert to end the meal   I am pleasantly surprised on how good this place is. I've always been quite skeptical about Asian restaurants in casinos as they are usually pretty bad, especially in smaller casinos. Especially those with like multiple specialties (chinese, japanese, etc). High price point, low quality. Price is fairly moderate for a casino restaurant but at least the food is good."}
{"text":"We ate here this evening  before a show. Seated quickly Service was very slow. Ordered the scallops with broccoli.  But the fish didn't taste  fresh,or even like scallops of any kind. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Service was pretty good here and the Chinese food is the best I have had in Vegas so far, living here for about three years. We've been looking for a favorite Chinese restaurant and I think we found it. We ordered the kung pao and Mongolian beef and both were excellent. We had the lunch special which also included soup, which was average. The meat on both dishes was extremely well seasoned and the sauce made with the Kung pao was to die for."}
{"text":"Save yourself some dough and go to Panda Express , the food is definitely better at panda .Our food was cold and took about an hour to get . If you happen to go to this awful place don't order the General Tso chicken it was disgusting , it was coated with some sort of jelly !"}
{"text":"Came here for a vegan afternoon snack and had the veggie lettuce wraps and veggie sushi. Wrap (4pcs) was better than the sushi (6pcs). Good value - $17 for both after tax."}
{"text":"Poor service and uncaring staff turned an otherwise four star experience to a two star disaster.  Not even the delicious food could compensate for serving one person at the table's meal 16 minutes after the other two.  And then to be told that it was ready and waiting to be served in the kitchen but the \"the waiter got backed up\" is inexcusable.  Barely an apology and nothing to compensate.  Pitiful.  Peter, the manager, made excuses and then dismissed me as my experience here clearly mattered nothing to him. He is clearly unqualified for his job.  And they are not worthy of my patronage. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before and their food is always excellent. The sushi is fresh and prepared well.  Last night I ordered the Salt and Pepper Sea Bass. It had a wonderful flavor, not too fishy, but because it was lightly tempura battered it was pretty greasy. This would not deter me from coming back, I would just order something else."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and was pleasantly surprised. Excellent menu of Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. It was fun to mix & match between the 3. Good staff with decent prices!"}
{"text":"From the time are party was greeted by our hostess Monica and waiter Deni our Saturday night show and dinner was a great experience. We liked the fact they had both traditional Japanese and Chinese offerings on their vast menu. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent Asian restaurant at the Orleans hotel. The won ton and duck noodle soups were delicious, especially on a cold, wintery night. Service was prompt, and attentive. The decor was nice as well. Will return to try other entrees."}
{"text":"Had a Kung pao chicken lunch special here for $10. Quite a deal and great food. The hot and sour soup was top notch!"}
{"text":"Ondori offers a plethora of Japanese and Chinese cuisine. They give really big portions for an unbeatable price, especially compared to other casino restaurants. Service was really good and even though we ordered seven dishes, the food came out all at once.  The rainbow roll was the healthiest thing I had that night. For $15, this is pricier than other sushi places. Presentation was not the greatest, but it still tasted great. The fish was fresh and the rice was perfect.  A half order of the roasted duck ($18) could feed two people. It tasted very similar to other Chinese duck dishes. Besides being oily, I can't complain about the flavor.  The honey walnut shrimp ($18) came with plenty of large shrimps, fried in a batter with sweet mayonnaise and walnut drizzled on top. This was my favorite dish, but I can't get over how unhealthy the mayonnaise was. I would have much preferred it on the side instead of on top of the shrimp.   The fried pork chops with salt and pepper ($15) were perfectly seasoned with onions and garlic. The flavorful seasonings were complemented by the tender pork chop, which was very easy to chew and not tough at all.   The oxtail pot ($21) came with large pieces of fatty oxtail meat. I wasn't a huge fan of this, but it tasted authentic.  The kung pao scallops ($19) came with peppers, onions, and peanuts in a slightly spicy sauce. The scallops were not large, but they were plentiful. I enjoyed this dish a lot, partly because it had the most veggies of all of the dishes.   Would definitely recommend this place for large portions and fresh food that won't break the bank!"}
{"text":"This is a new \"Asian fusion\" restaurant that was opened a few weeks ago.   If you think this is a five star restaurant based on three reviews, please check again. Note, all those reviews have a central theme indicating the name of the servers and how well they are attended to by the servers. There was little or no mention of the food style and quality.  I went to this place with my wife and my brother on a Sunday nite. We arrived at 6 pm but  were told that we have to wait for 15 minutes even though the place was pretty empty. Why?? Not enough servers??  The place was essentially divided into two rooms. The front room is set up for a liquor bar and a sushi bar with few tables in between. The back room is essentially a dining room.  Place is well decorated and easy to blend in. Acoustics are good.   The menu is essentially an American Chinese menu with Japanese sushi and some additional items.   We had an Asian looking waitress who had little or no knowledge of the items on the menu. When we ordered, she had to look at the menu and then write it down. Of course, she wasn't able to suggest the signature dishes and etc.  Quite disappointing.  For appetizers, we ordered Spicy Tuna hand roll, Spicy Tuna on rice cakes and Chinese BBQ ribs. The hand roll was not ok, flavor was kind of bland and not exciting, tuna was too ground up, seaweed was not crisp and the rice was slightly undercooked. The Tuna on rice cakes were of the same criticism. The ribs were fatty but tasty. For appetizers, they rate a C at best.   For soup, we ordered Hot and Sour Soup. Very disappointing. Soup was watery, insufficient ingredients and worst of all, the \"hotness\" was derived from chili sauce which would then over power the whole taste. No ifs or buts, this is a total failure for Hot and Sour Soup.  No more than a D+ for the soup.   For entries, we ordered On Choy ( an Asian veggie ) with fermented bean curd -- a very traditional Cantonese dish and a Sea Bass hot pot . Unfortunately, when the On Choy dish was served, it had cooled down a bit and thus lost the fragrance of the fermented bean curd.  This is no more than a C-.   For the sea bass hot pot, it was another disaster. Traditionally, this dish is served in clay pots. The idea of using clay pots is that clay pots tend to hold heat much longer. Instead, this place uses metal pots. Worst off, they cooked the dish first and then transferred to the pot - losing the meaning of \"Hot\" pot. A total disaster -- no more than a D.  All in all it was a disappointing dinner since we had high expectation. If this were a neighborhood American Chinese restaurant, they would get a 3 star. But here, where expectations are much higher, a 2 star rating will be considered as an over rating."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Service was quick and portions are huge. It was packed so they took down our number and called about 20 minutes later. We ordered the Yang Chow fried rice, enough for three. We also ordered the fried squid with salt and pepper, also enough for three, slightly spicy and the Kung Pao chicken, a little too many peanuts but overall everything was good"}
{"text":"The reason I give it one star is because I didn't get a chance to eat there but the service was great.  I didn't get to eat because one of the sushi chefs didn't show so the wait for sushi was over an hour.  I ordered and wasn't told that the wait was going to be very long so as time passed I asked our server how much longer and she said it will still be a while so I cancelled our order an hour in.  I was really in the mood for sushi and was disappointed not being able to eat there.  The up side is the manager came over and comped our drinks.  Great customer service.  If I ever go back I will definitely try again and will surely post four to five stars!!!"}
{"text":"Please never sit at the sushi bar when ken is working....he is ignorant and very rude.... I honestly wants to jump over the counter and slap him so he comes to his senses. He literary ignored my husband and I for good 10 minutes before we asked if we can place our food order. Mind you we come here at least every other week. I hope management can teach him some manners and basic customer service skills. When we were leaving we asked to speak to a manager and surprisingly the manager was not able to come and speak to us. It is obvious that managements in this restaurant needs a revamp. The food is great management as a horrible don't waste your time or money"}
{"text":"Actually pretty bomb.... I was definitely surprised with the quality of food here, being that the casino comped my entire meal I was expecting low quality cuisine at best. Each thing off the menu was beautifully presented and filled with just the right amount of flavor. Nothing was too overwhelming and nothing was bland. The sushi was excellent too.... don't be thrown off for the casino it's in, it's definitely top quality Chinese food and sushi."}
{"text":"Was hanging with the girls in the Orleans hotel and got hungry.  A few us went searching for food while the rest gambled.  Found this place in the middle of the casino and LOVED the Pineapple Chicken Curry Fried Rice.  OMG!  I need to figure out how this was made and make it at home!  DELISH!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the revamp of this restaurant.  It's fresh and a great fusion of Chinese and Japanese food.  The happy hour menu is a fantastic deal  and so good.  The beef lomen and the teriyaki chicken and of course the spring roll are highly recommended.  The customer service was also pretty stellar!  Keep this up guys and you will be my one Asian restaurant stop in vegas even if I'm not staying at the Orleans."}
{"text":"Came here late night while I was in Vegas, and it did not disappoint! Located at The Orleans Hotel off the strip.  My family loves the duck noodle soup here. (Roasted duck, egg noodles, veggies.) At first glance, the portion looks like a smaller bowl of \"Pho\", but don't be fooled because they are super generous with the duck, a lot of meat and noodles! Nobody I was with was able to finish it!  Since I don't eat meat, I ordered the Seafood Noodle Soup! It was delicious, but a little bland in flavor of broth but it was a too light for my liking. The variety of seafood was exciting though. Large scallops, shrimps, fish, and veggies. So good! All that for ONLY $15.00!!!!   I love this place because they're not stingy on their portions!"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends because it was near by. We ordered a few rolls and tofu lettuce wraps were to die for! Our waiter June was excellent as well, he was patient and always catered to us when needed. Overall good food and great service."}
{"text":"Ambiance is very inviting. Lot of gold red an black throughout the resturant. Me and my co workers went for happy hour. No one was disappointed. TK the bar tender was very kind and attentive. We enjoyed the Beef Lo Me in, very flavorful. Added garlic chilli sauce offered by the bar really nice addition. We also enjoyed the Alaska roll and a Philadelphia roll. Both rolls where soft and nice rolled. We really had a great work lunch. Thank you Ondori kitchen  for the hospitality"}
{"text":"Delicious food and fantastic service! My boyfriend and I came here on a whim tonight. We ordered the Philly and Alaska rolls which were fresh and tasty. We also enjoyed canton spare ribs, beef chow fun and steamed sea bass filet. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Vegas!!!!!! Freshest sushi and the greatest staff. Tina is \"A\" #one!! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"This is one my favorite favorite Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas. They have very decent foods and price. Large menu, and very good service."}
{"text":"Love this place have been a few times now with my husband and the sushi is great and fresh! Love the Uni and the sashimi special service is fast and efficient will definitely be coming here often for our sushi fix! The rolls are well put together also and the staff always have great suggestions"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in The Orleans casino.  The service here was great!  They checked in on us regularly and could anticipate when we needed something.  The food also came out quickly.  We had the California roll and beef Lo mein.  They were both great.  I would not recommend the chicken and broccoli.  It was a little plain for our liking.  Would definitely return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with good food but... terrible lighting. It was SO bright in this restaurant it felt like a diner. Take down the lighting just a few notches and this would be a great spot."}
{"text":"This is a newer restaurant at The Orleans Hotel & Casino. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the atmosphere seems really warm and inviting!  So I will be honest and say the multiple times I have gotten food here I have gotten it to go so I cannot comment on the service or plating presentation. I will stress that even though for a $2.50 to go fee you can carry out your food, this is a fine dining establishment and light years away from just a take out place.  Simply put.... the food is amazing! The right amount of spice, the perfect portion and left me wanting to have it again the next day. The food is worth it in my opinion.  When i go back, i will certainly dine in so i can chronicle that experience."}
{"text":"This is located inside the Orleans Casino. We went there for an early lunch. Not very busy when we were here.  Service was very good and rolls were very tasty.  Would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Located in the Orleans casino near the craps tables. They are pretty busy so I ate at the sushi bar. The view from the sushi bar was pretty good. I ordered a duck noodle soup and a crunchy roll. Initially, I just ordered the soup but watching the sushi chef make sushi made me want to eat something that he made. He was very generous with the cuts of fish and the portion size in general was huge. Totally worth the price.  Fish looked pretty fresh too and he put a huge clump of wasabi with every platter of sushi or sashimi. My crunchy roll was delicious. The duck noodle soup was also very good and I left pretty full. The restaurant is run by Chinese people but the service was pretty good. Waitresses and hostess were pretty. Overall a good dining experience. Will definitely eat here again next time I'm at the Orleans."}
{"text":"Ondori kitchen is located in the Orleans Hotel to the right of alligator bar. Overall the place was a great place to grab a late night snack after getting the munchies. Tip: For those that are trying to order takeout - there is a $2.50 charge for orders under $50 and $5.00 for orders over $50.  Service: Polite and always there to refill our water. Messed up our order but was apologetic and quick to correct the order. (4/5)  Location: Orleans hotel is located off the strip so if your not living in the hotel, this might not be the best place to go for you. (3/5)  Food: We got the pork fried rice and the ma po tofu with chicken. Overall, while definitely catered toward Americans, the food was quite tasty. The pork fried rice was definitely the better of the two but the tofu was not bad. Both dishes also contained carrots and peas which was interesting as I've never eaten tofu or fried rice with carrots and peas - maybe I'm just too Asian? (3.5/5)  Value: Not to expensive - good price for a Vegas restaurant. The total for two dishes with tax was $24.50. In addition, portion sizes were fairly large and will definitely fill you up. (5/5)  Ambience: The decor was nice and pleasant. The place was very casual but you can definitely dress up if you want.(4.5/5)  Overall, this place is Panda Express with s facelift. Similar to PF Changs but  more authentic and better ambience. Not a bad place to go if your craving some American Asian food!!!"}
{"text":"We had the best night and had the greatest waiter, Deni!!! I recommend coming here often!!!"}
{"text":"The soy sauce was the only decent part of this place and i hate soy sauce. Seriously worst food I've had. \"Garlic\" edamame was raw , no garlic,  and slathered with chili paste? Potstickers were thrown in a pan with no oil. One side burnt,  the rest gooey and bland not to mention full of grit. The spare ribs are like the reject ribs with sauce thrown on...super chewy, and not much edible on them.  I will never eat there again.  This place is horrible!"}
{"text":"We came in today not realizing it was happy hour. What a great deal your happy hour is. Everything on the food menu portion of it is what we always order anyways. We came in to sit and eat and see T.K. but he wasn't working. Thats ok though.  We made another new favorite person there to come and see. Her name is Tai. She is the new bartender there.  We had such an amazing time with her yesterday and she made us feel so welcome. We had great conversation with her and her lemon drop martinis are on point. We didn't even realize till after we left that we were there for over 2 hours. She is such a great bartender. Thank you Tai for such a great time. We will be seeing you again soon."}
{"text":"I Absolutely love this place.... A MUST go whenever in Vegas.... everything is great... favorite sushi roll \"sex on a roll\" MUST TRY... LOVE the Sweet and spicy soup (MY FAVORITE).. All the meats are great... Highly recommend!!!!! I never give 5"}
{"text":"This review is purely for the Japanese menu. Do not order the Toro it's godawful. It's priced at 40/5 pieces which is not the worst but still very expensive. When we finally get the fish it looked way too stiff of a cut for Toro.  When I put it in my mouth instead of the usual soft melting fish I get the most chewy sashimi I've ever tasted. Either the chef have no idea how to cut a piece of sashimi or it's from the worst/ tough part of the fish. Either way it was not suitable for the price they are charging. The rest of the sushi were hit or miss. Yellowtail was good, tuna soso, salmon ok, halibut ok, the sushi rolls we got were pretty delicious though. The server and hostess are both very nice so at least there is that too. Hopefully next time I can try the Chinese side of the menu and change my rating."}
{"text":"We came in to town from Seattle and this place exceeded all expectations. From the divine dumplings to the perfectly seasoned garlic chicken, and the Mongolian beef - you'll love it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place really is a gem! I didn't expect to find such a good sushi place being that it was right here in The Orleans Hotel and Casino, I was pleasantly surprised. The staff first of all was totally on point, TK and Mr. Lee really know how to give good service. The food was some of the best I've had in a long time. I had the sashimi special which gave a good variety and good portion size, plus it came with amazing miso soup and a killer cucumber salad. Pricing here is a good value also. Honestly I was a bit skeptical based on prior reviews which I found were way off base. I would for sure recommend coming here, you will have a good time and find some killer sushi! Give it a shot."}
{"text":"I came here for my aunt's birthday on the 13th of this month. Since its inside the Orleans and a high school graduation was taking place at the nearby Orleans Arena, it was difficult to find a decent parking space. This restaurant has a combination of Chinese / Japanese / Korean food all in one menu. I had the chicken lo Mein while we all shared a plate of dumplings. It's kind of like PF Changs, another one of my favorites, but a little more decent. As it was my first time here, the food was definitely worth trying. They even have a menu featuring all kinds of Japanese desserts, like green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"I LUV this restaurant!!! The decor is beautiful and contemporary not like Koji(closed). Beside the decor the food is excellent. My sister took the family to dinner(my first) eating here. They have sushi bar (can't eat sashimi ) only cooked rolls.  The Peking duck was really good, the skin was crispy and the meat is very flavor($49) was a bit pricy.  I didn't have to pay so it's ok..hehe!! Steam chicken was good, sauté garlic ong choy, salted fish fried rice.. This is my new fav. Chinese restaurant, beside ping pang pong(only for dim sum). I enjoy the beautiful atmosphere and good service.. Not like typical Asian restaurants with bad service"}
{"text":"5/25/18 After my husband's sons graduation at the Orleans. Instead of traveling out for lunch we decided to stay at the Orleans in search of a place to eat for lunch.   Ondori Asian Kitchen serves Japanese and Chinese cuisine. Food is awesome. The Orange chicken is delicious. I got me a lunch bento box. Wasn't able to take a whole lot of pix cause we were in a rush to head to LA.   Staff is nice, clean and nice dining area. I will be back if im here again. Price is reasonable and portions are good.   Keep up the good work!   Happy Eats!!"}
{"text":"Ordered ToGo. I ordered when there were only 2 tables with people sitting. They said it would take 15 minutes. Food actually took 30 minutes to come out and I only ordered 1 dish.   Dry Beef Chow Fun: way too much oil. I've ordered chow fun from so many places. I know every place make chow fun different, but they drenched it. One positive aspect: they put a lot of beef. The flavor of the chow fun is okay. The oil is just a big let down.   Overall: this restaurant is not really prepared to handle a crowd. With a lot of empty seats...they get backed up too fast. I saw a lot of waiters, so probably they need more chefs."}
{"text":"Checked into the orleans around 6p and was super hungry.  Service was fast and on point!! The spicy tuna on crispy rice was outstanding, equally as good was the fire roll (the \"special sauce\" is delish), dynamite roll, spicy yellowtail (hamachi) handroll.  The prices are very reasonable.  Later on around 12:45a we went back to eat again as we had jus picked up our son from the airport and that where he wanted to eat, so we had our second round of sushi."}
{"text":"The service was really great each time we have come in everyone is very helpful. We always come in during lunch. Today we got a bento box. The food was delicious I like the fact you can build your own bento box so you can choose what ever you want. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food! The prices are reasonable. The portions are big. The service is great. The ambiance is classy. We ordered oxtail hot pot, orange chicken, and crispy fried noodles. All are highly recommended."}
{"text":"Customer service was awesome. I had veggie fried rice and a seafood soup with rice noodles. They also provided me with a gluten free soy sauce . Thee food was delicious. Next time I will definitely try the sushi.."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise within The Orleans.   Had a $5 happy hour special lemon drop drink, along with a regular portion of beef lo mein.  For happy hour they did have a smaller portion of bee lo mein, but I was hungry.  Five stars for the drink and four stars for the lo mein.  The decor is rather modern, but uninspiring.  Service was attentive."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. The service was great, very attentive and friendly. I had the Mongolian Beef lunch special, very tasty and reasonably priced. The manager Lee came by to make sure we were doing okay.  I definitely recommend and will return to try more."}
{"text":"We were staying here & looked at the reviews & were about to pass, but decided to give it a try because the menu was so varied & had so many choices. There was a 5 minute wait for a table, so we took their buzzer & went for a short walk & were seated promptly. The waiter, Walter, was just marvelous, be sure to ask for him !!!  It was just the two of us, but here's what we tried.  Hot & Sour soup, w/ classic crispy noodles. The cup was enough for the two of us to share & just spicy enough with a rich broth. The BBQ chicken wings were deliciously sweet, sticky & perfectly cooked.  We ordered the sauteed garlic green beans that were just perfect.  The size of the portions is such that we had left overs. ( I won't tell you when we finished them!!)  We had the Orange crispy beef w/scallions which is usually a favorite of mine & these did not disappoint, I wish I was hungrier.   The food here is fantastic & Walter is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Denies and Joey are very kind We like the food here... It's Chinese mix with Japanese style... See pictures all my favorite..."}
{"text":"My husband and I were wonderfully surprised with dinner here recently. We selected three dishes from their Chinese food menu. The Pine Nut Shrimp, Fried Tofu and Mixed Vegetables, and Dry Chow Fun came out piping hot, cooked to perfection and flavorful. The staff was attentive, the ambiance was nice...added pluses to a nice meal!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible! If you want good Japanese food, move on over to Spring Mountain Road. It's very clear to me that this \"restaurant\" shares their kitchen with the coffee shop next door. I could go on with details, but let me just say that this is basically a Panda Express dressed up to look nice."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, it was for an employee appreciation dinner. I was pretty surprised this restaurant was hiding inside The Orleans. I've heard of it, but no one really talks about it. And I think I know why.  First of all, the place itself is not too bad. The restaurant was clean throughout and had a very social-like vibe to it. My group was seated in a secluded part of the restaurant that was located in the back corner of the place. It's great for bigger groups that prefer a more intimate and slightly more quiet dining experience.  Service was okay. It wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worse. Since our group consisted of 10 people, you would think they would offer more attentive service. There were a couple of times it seemed the waiters forgot to check up on our table or refill our drinks.  Now for the food... For those that know me, I'm a big foodie. And when it comes to authentic cuisine of any kind, I have high expectations when businesses try to prove what they say about themselves. This place offers a mixture of Chinese and Japanese dishes.  To be honest, I wasn't really impressed with much. There are plenty of restaurants along the Chinatown area that serve authentic Asian cuisine at better prices as well as flavors. For what you're paying, you can get the same exact dish for much less and with the same type of ambience, all along Spring Mountain Rd. As for the sushi, the presentation and freshness was good, and it seemed like it was enjoyed the most.  All in all, if you're looking to spend money because you want a delightful dinner experience that's near The Strip and offers a hint of formality, this would be a nice place to hit up. However, if you just want a straight up nice dinner that is Asian-inspired and only care about quality and taste, find another place to go. Save this restaurant for a more formal occasion or when you're looking for a place to chill/catch-up with friends over drinks and some food. It definitely gives off that kind of vibe."}
{"text":"This place lives up to its reputation amongst my friends. I had a delicious Asian salad and service was fast and friendly. Shoutout to the awesome bartenders serving us, Joey and TK!"}
{"text":"The decor to service to food was all in all amazing!  The food was so delicious!! Presentation as well as portion size was on point!  I'm definitely coming back!!  I would have taken a photo but it would have been of empty dishes. I couldn't resist not eating."}
{"text":", you have to order the orange chicken. By far it is the best orange chicken I have had at any Chinese restaurant. We also ordered the chicken chow mein and the seafood Hot Pot they were very good also but the Orioles chicken stands out as the best. It is lightly breaded with a very strong orange taste that makes it Simply Delicious. The best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Awesome Asianness.  Food heaven.  The sushi and sashimi are really delicious and fresh.  Also ordered the pork belly with Chinese veggies, friend seabass with salt and pepper.  Delicious.  A great place to dine if you want really fresh seafood.  They also serve dim sum from 11- 3pm.  If you like dim sum, this restaurant is also a great choice.  All in all, great food."}
{"text":"The restaurant is modern, clean and pleasant. All the employees were great; from the hostess who greeted us, our  server, the nice man who refilled our drinks and cleared our table, the manager on the floor to the hostess again thanking us on the way out. We ordered from the Chinese lunch menu; mongolian beef (asked for it not to spicy). My lunch was fresh and delicious and must say out of the many many Chinese restaurants I've eaten at, this was by far the best! The beef was clearly top quality; tender and flavorful. We also had pork lo mein from lunch menu and was excellent too. Both were $10.00 each which included entree, rice, egg roll and either miso, hot and sour or egg drop soup. We also had peking dumplings THEY WERE DELICIOUS; flavorful, tender and again clearly freshly made. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Great food!  I had fish soup and my husband had golden chicken.  Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"First time here! I loved how they had Chinese and sushi in one spot! And they are open late! Mark was our server and was very attentive and always asked if we needed anything! Food was really yummy..and we will definitely be back to try other things!"}
{"text":"i love this place. all that i want to a restaurant is here. great selection of food. food quality is the best, service is great. i highly recommend this place for great selection of chinese and japanese food... roast duck and sushi rolls are delicious."}
{"text":"The Chinese food here is the best I have had in this city!  It's fresh, tasty and crisp.  The wait staff is absolutely the friendliest around.  They have $10.00 lunch specials during the week that you can't beat!  My favorite Chinese place by far!"}
{"text":"A-OK! Randomly tried this place on a Saturday night and I wasn't disappointed. Staff was friendly and attentive. Ordered a drink and a couple sushi rolls that I enjoyed but unfortunately I wasn't a fan of the chicken fried rice or orange chicken - different tasting/texture and do feel it was all a little overpriced for quality but took into consideration the type of food and being inside a casino. Not against going back but wouldn't go out of my way to go again."}
{"text":"Food is okay..good service. Ordered the salmon skin salad. Was filling but nothing that I would go back to order."}
{"text":"My wife and myself dined here when it first opened. We prefer Cantonese style which is their method. This was our third time eating here. We ordered cashew chicken and chicken lo mein. Previously the food was delicious and very good. This time where was the chicken. I asked our serve did they switch to using doves or biddies because the few pieces of chicken in our dishes we did find were no larger than my fingernail. She said something like  they slice it small because that was Cantonese style. Pardon me.  I'm a local and have eaten everywhere in town. High end establishments etc. We tip very well. A server gave us his business card at n9ne recently can you believe that. There was not a piece of chicken larger than a small sugar cube honestly. The meals were tasty enough but no chicken. The Boyd group is so chinchy they are cutting back on everything. The Chinese tea is even on the bill now. OMG another one scratched off our list. Fortunes closed and this was a good alternative. Now I have to try Wo Fat. Sushi is also served by their Japanese chefs  so really it's 2 types of food served. Usually casino owned restaurants are good. I am now longer6a patron an d there are plenty of others to take my place. Good luck if you want decent sized chicken slices. They shouldn't be any smaller than a 50 cent coin preferably over a silver Dollar. I know the  kitchen staff is only following the bean counters orders but give us diners something other than crumbs and expect us to take it.  No rating of 2 1/2 stars is available so they got lucky"}
{"text":"A solid 3.5. This is the new Asian place in The Orleans. As it's predecessor, it is heavy on the sushi but this time with a slightly more varied Asian entree menu. I chose the Singapore Noodles and was happy with exception of the pork being diced so small that when I was getting full and wanted to pick out the good stuff from the noodles with my chop sticks it was hard. The service fluctuated from great to non existent during the evening. I witnessed the shift manager talking down to his help several times so I imagine keeping employees is hard. I will go back again as I was recommended several dishes from folks I met at the bar."}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal and the service was super good! We went during lunch and my friend and we got shumai, crab rangoons, miso soup, wonton soup, the love me tender roll, and sweet and sour chicken. I will definitely be coming here again the next time I come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food presentation is excellent. Head Sushi Chef Shige is awesome making some beautiful and tasty sushi. The Chinese food was very delicious. Our server and bus help was very helpful and friendly too."}
{"text":"Had a pretty phenomenal experience eating at the bar the other day. The Bartender had everything on point, couldn't have ask for anything more. Bartenders name I think is TK, he suggested I try a Lychee Martini. Was Soooo good. Had the Sashimi Special, gotta say was way better than expected. Overall great experience. 5/5"}
{"text":"For them to collectively claim their restaurant as an ASIAN KITCHEN is a misnomer and an utter overstatement when what it is, what they are and what they offer are nothing but mediocre albeit tolerable Americanized (i.e. bastardized) Chinese and Japanese food.  But I guess if you're already IN the casino and presumably hungry but either inebriated and/or too lazy to go to Panda Express, they'd be the other worse alternative."}
{"text":"The food was delicious once we finally received our food. The sliced bbq pork is amazing. We ate mostly sushi rolls. One dish was orange chicken and fried rice. Good flavor and excellent plate presentation. The absolute worst service ever!  Wait staff would pass buy. Waited several minutes to place appetizers  and then had to ask to place our food order with a different server. One of the four meals came out and was finished before the other 3 main dishes were served. We had made reservations but the place had many open tables. Due to the lack of service we will never be back. Lost the business from these four Las Vegas locals."}
{"text":"Come here for some great Japanese & Chinese food! We stuck to the Chinese side as we don't have any good places back home. Service was great & food came in a timely manner. Got the salt & pepper pork ribs, sweet & sour chicken, garlic lo mein, honey walnut shrimp, salmon skin salad & pepper beef with eggplant which were all very excellent. For dessert I got the strawberry snow ice with mochi, mango popping bubbles, & passion fruit jelly. This now, was amazing! Better then any snow ice I've ever had! If you go here, try this you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is my daughters favorite restaurant. They have her sushi and miso soup and they also have my Chinese food favorites. The bar is great. I recommend the lychee martini. TK is an amazing bartender. I definitely recommend checking them out next time you're in the area. We drive 3 hours for it so it's definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"You got to check this place out come during happy hour the food is half price that drinks are amazing the staff is awesome and there's even a girl named Christmas who's really awesome."}
{"text":"I just moved here from Hawaii and got recommended to try out this Asian restaurant for lunch and the food was really tasty. I liked that it has a sushi bar too! My server John did a really good job refilling our tea and was polite and humorous. I definitely would come here again."}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant blending Japanese and Chinese food inside the Orleans Hotel off the strip in Vegas.  Unlike the surrounding Orleans hotel, the restaurant looks new and inviting.  The interior is well-decorated in a modern, Asian theme with unique decorations like rice bowls on the walls. There is a mixture of booth and table seating.  The menu is expansive featuring unique rolls, sashimi, traditional and modern Chinese dishes, and a large section of Japanese food as well.    Service started out excellent though seemed to gradually deteriorate as the evening went on with the server being harder and harder to find.  She was friendly once we found her, though.  The real highlights of the meal were the Burning Night Roll and the Spider Roll.  Delicious, spicy, and fresh rolls unique to Ondori and definitely a step up from your basic California or Spicy Tuna roll.    We had a variety of entrees including Sweet and Sour Pork, Asparagus with Garlic Sauce, Kung Pao Chicken, and Shrimp Lo Mein.  The pork was the low light of the meal.  It was too heavily breaded and tasted like what you'd find in a cheap, hole in the wall, Chinese restaurant.  The shrimp was the highlight.  Large, fresh-tasting shrimp were spread throughout the noodles and vegetables.  The asparagus was also good with a mild and not overpowering garlic flavor.  The Kung Pao was fairly good and chock full of spice and peanuts.    For dessert we went for the mango flavored mochi ice cream which was delicious!   A great ending to the meal.   Overall, this was a delicious meal in a cool and modern restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, I had shrimp and veggie tempura, DELICIOUS and our server it was polite and informed us and suggested us a great choice of desert strawberry ice cream with flavored bursting bubbles. Something different, I loved it!! Definitely going to be one of our spots. Nice place, very elegant, good service and awesome meal."}
{"text":"Located inside The Orleans Hotel, Casino & Spa is this Japanese/Chinese fusion restaurant which was opened late and provided a tasty, quick meal after a night out on the town before retiring to our room upstairs.   Hubs and the littlest one weren't hungry so baby girl had a simple California roll and I had what could have possibly been the most delicious tofu lettuce wraps ever! They were much better than I anticipated! The sauce was perfectly tangy and sweet with a hint of spice. The filing was generous and overall it was the perfect amount of food.  Both of these items were priced very fair especially for Vegas standards.   I'm not sure I would go out of my way to dine here if you're not staying at this hotel. But if you are, and want an easy, reasonable option I would say definitely try it!   Their salt and pepper tofu and needle noodle dishes looked tempting as well. Their big hunks of sashimi were very impressive also.   Service was fantastic even close to closing time!"}
{"text":"Casey at the bar was awesome! Food was amazing, gotta try the Mongolian beef.... and sit at the bar with Casey!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Kung Pao Shrimp, She had the steamed salmon with black bean sauce. The Kung Pao was typical fare; nothing extraordinary. The steamed salmon was probably a better choice...Portion sizes were adequate. The service was attentive \"enough\", but unexceptional. If you are staying at the Orleans and prefer to stay on property, Ondori provides a decent dinner at a fair price. Overall, it is an average restaurant, providing decently average food, with no reason to complain about, or compliment their service."}
{"text":"Nestled inside The Orleans is this restaurant that serves Sushi as well as Chinese Food. I had the Mongolian Beef, which I thought was excellent..lots of Beef with green and white onion. It came with a nice thick sauce and was served with a generous portion of choice of Steamed or Fried Rice..I chose steamed.. The staff were very nice and did not try and \"Hurry me up\".. I would definitely recommend the Ondori for anyone who would like Asian Food when in Las Vegas..!!"}
{"text":"Oh this is a great place for chinese food! The shrimp fried rice was one of the best i had in a while! For sure if you here try that! I also got the BBQ spare ribs which were ok! They didn't have much meat on them (4 total) but still good! The staff was very good and attentive to all my needs. The place is very clean and well kept. I will be back to try different items but so far i like what i see!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service. A little pricey, but its inside a casino. Had a spicy-tuna roll and the tuna seemed a little mushy. That was a turn-off. Will try some other dishes on my next visit."}
{"text":"This is like an better Americanized Panda Express located conveniently inside Orleans Hotel. Service was superb, ambience was nice (normal for loud families, but really loud for quiet people).  Food was salty and too oily for me, but apparently that's normal. I've heard there were complaints about it already, but no change was done.."}
{"text":"Five stars mainly because of the mackerel sushi. I really like any of the mackerel choices. Also a spicy roll and Beth having orange chicken which is great. Our first time here and all good. Same service."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst most over priced sushi/sashimi I have ever eaten. We thought it's Christmas and we're going to a movie, let's give it a try. Bad decision! Grocery store pre-made sushi is better."}
{"text":"This exceptional establishment blends Japanese and Chinese perfectly!  The atmosphere is low-key Asian and very clean.  The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.  Dennis took very good care of us! It's a bit pricey, but so worth it.   The General Tso chicken should be used as an example for other restaurants. We tested two different sushi chef's tuna tataki and the were delicious.  The sashimi platter was tasty and beautiful.  We asked for the chef to freestyle for us and the spicy tuna/eel roll we were given rocked! The green tea mochi for dessert was the perfect ending."}
{"text":"Sashimi Trio was pricey but really fantastic.  It's a modern miracle that I had fresh, appetizing sashimi on Sunday night and several hundred miles from the Pacific.  Came with a large cucumber salad that was crisp and nicely seasoned.  Also a nice miso soup--though a bit too much tofu.  I also had them bring me a small bowl of sushi rice, which they were happy to oblige."}
{"text":"This restaurant opens late that is good for us. This is inside the hotel that is very convenient for people who stay in the hotel. The Japanese and Chinese food restaurant. The staffs are friendly. The food is okay. 4 stars for food and 4.5 stars for Services"}
{"text":"This place is hidden inside the Orleans casino.  They have a full menu with Chinese and Japanese food.    We ordered the lettuce wraps and it was very flavorful.  The sauce that comes with it was perfect.  Beef chow fun (no gravy or sauce) is always a hit with the kiddos. No complaint there.  Steam flounder cooked with ginger and Green onions at market price was delish  Green beans xo sauce was just right.  We ordered a variety of Sushi rolls, but they were ok.  I would stick with the Chinese dishes and go elsewhere for sushi.  Service was a little slow."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I usually order the Mongolian beef here or anything with beef. I've tried other stuff too and it was all good. It's a really friendly place and will definitely be back. I could eat here forever. So many Vietnamese people here. I guess it's because of the gambling that goes on."}
{"text":"Last Day in Las Vegas. Lunch before heading to the airport. Sharon and Jan ordered Happy Family style meals. Sweet and sour Pork-chops, noodles, egg drop soup, walnut shrimp, lettuce wraps and a variety of other  tasty items. The Restaurant is large and spacious. I really enjoyed all the various artwork and drawings in the walls. As we talked and enjoyed the meal, the waiter stopped by to check on us from time to time. Refilling the hot tea and drinks. It is a quiet and serene spot to enjoy a meal. It's nestled off to the side away from the hustle and bustle of The slots. They played very nice music."}
{"text":"Have been to Ondori at the Orleans twice now and both times was fantastic. The salt and pepper pork chops and the beef with black pepper sauce with eggplant is outstanding. They went above and beyond with the decor and I can't say enough about the service! Mei was our server and made the experience that much better, great attitude and a lot of fun!!! Atmosphere, service and food all 5 stars! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tina was an Amazing Hostess! She made our experience here at Ondori one to remember! Originally from the Philippines her hospitality was homemade and very authentic. She recommended the perfect dishes and made our Anniversary such a pleasant evening. I highly recommend Ondori for a wonderful eventful time.   Update: 2/24/2018  Been here 2 times since first Check-In and review. We've since had the pleasure of being served by both Raymond and Danny. Both were absolutely phenomenal and I'd have to say this has got to be one of the most hospitable fine dining restaurants in the Las Vegas Valley. So thankful for such amazing personalities while indulging in such classy and tasteful dishes served to us. Thank you again for the opportunity to experience such a wonderful vibe."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT SERVICE! As soon as I walked up to the bar I was greeted by my bartender, Joey! He was upbeat and very knowledgeable about the food menu as well as cocktails. I'll return, again and again!!"}
{"text":"The service is horrible. They take forever to take the order and then they serve  the appetizers and the main course at the same time.  When they present the check they do not remove any plates from the table. They leave you with all the dirty plates from the appetizers and dinner.   We have given them several chances to improve their service but it hasn't improved."}
{"text":"Just stepped in this Asian restaurant for a light lunch . Two of us ordered noodle dishes: Taiwanese Beef Shank noodle and the Hong Kong style beef stew with egg noodle. The noodles were served in a timely manner and the aroma with the soup dishes were wonderful.  The portion of the dishes are generous, with the ingredients packed over the noodles. Food here are of good quality with gai-lan broccoli as garnish.   I tasted the beef stew noodle, the broth is very rich and flavorful, while the stew was tasty and cooked tenderly, the egg noodle was al dente, with a nice texture. My selection of Taiwanese beef shank noodle came in a richer broth which was slightly spicy. Besides gai-lan as garnish, it has some diced pickled cabbage too. The sliced beef shank was delicious and with some tendon, both are so tender and it just melts in the mouth.   We also ordered a side dish of Char-siu barbecue pork, which was very moist, tasteful with a honey glaze. The employees were very friendly, services efficient and attentive. Our lunch was very delightful and it lead to our return for dinner with our friends in the evening.  The four of us shared some hot sake and beer before our meal, and since I had Chinese food for lunch,I and my better half decided to go Japanese. I selected Ankimo ( Monk fish liver) as appetizer and Chirase for main course versus the grilled Hamachi collars for my lady. Our friends ordered Spicy Tuna rolls & selected a noodle dish - Shredded pork with preserved beets for her entree. Side order of garlic fried chicken wings and Char-siu was also ordered for sharing. The slices of Ankimo was very creamy, tasted similar of liver pate with a light fishy scent. Miso soup and Namasu (pickled cucumber) were served with the hamachi kama and chirase. Both were very nice and refreshing. My chirase was packed with all sort of fishes and topped off with ikura and uni, all ingredients were very fresh and nicely presented. Hamachi was cooked just right, slightly charred and moist within, it went well with the ponzu sauce served. Our friends also enjoyed their meals too.    Everything went well and the four of us really had a good time. In general, we are overwhelmed that Ondori exists in this casino hotel, the excellent food and service are impeccable which by far surpass our expectations of casino restaurants.  A nice addition."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, and atmosphere. All the food was authentic and the service was good. Ask for Dani he will take good care of you!"}
{"text":"Introduction: Tried this place out for the first time cause we didn't want to leave the Casino after a late movie night out. Glad we tried it.  Quality: 4/5 I was surprised how good their Chinese food was.  Especially going in and being under the impression that it was a Japanese restaurant.  I had the Garlic noodle and my friend had the pork buns. Both were equally good, however, as good as the noodle was, it was missing poultry. I did order with Chicken, but my waiter messed up, otherwise, I can see this dish an easy five stars.  Price: 4/5 What we ordered was definitely great pricing. However, I feel that some of the other dishes were a little pricy for Chinese food.  To be fair, if it turns out to be as good as my Garlic noodles, it wouldn't matter.  Customer Service: 4/5 The waiter was decent, except he missed my chicken on my Garlic noodles like I requested. In addition, never refilled our hot tea and ice water, even though we asked for it and he acknowledged us.  It wasn't even busy, he was definitely not on his \"A\" game.  Atmosphere: 5/5 Very nice decor and cozy atmosphere.  Cleanliness: 5/5 Very clean and everything looked super organized."}
{"text":"Food done excellent, good variety and very good price. The downside is very poor service based on several visits. Had to wait over 15 minutes to have wait persons take order every time and one waited 20 minutes for bill  after asking for it and then just left the cash on the table. They were not that busy, staff would stop and chat in little room with cash machine."}
{"text":"I've been here countless times. It's located inside the Orleans hotel. It's a good place for lunch as they have a variety of lunch specials. The menu selections is a combination of Chinese and Japanese. The price is very affordable and the service is to notch."}
{"text":"I love this place! Been here a few times. They have different variety of foods such as Chinese and Japanese. I tried both! Chinese food taste very authentic and the Japanese food is pretty fresh especially the sashimi... definitely recommend it if anyone is looking for a authentic chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Casey makes the best ginger lemon drops and happy hour is great. We ate here 5 times while we stayed. Great menu and the best Mongolian chicken I have ever had!!! Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience with this restaurant only when Mr.Lee is here. His management style and welcoming personality really makes this location feel like home.  We have come here when he is not present and both the staff and food is not up to par, he truly takes his passion and invests it in this location. He inspects the food and makes sure all of the staff is constantly doing something as a restaurant should.   He brought Chef Mai out to introduce us and convinced us to try the food with vegetables because we have always ordered without. Needless to say it was amazing and his commitment is matched.   Amazing food and an amazing experience- restaurant is on point."}
{"text":"This review is based on The TW beef shank noodle that I ordered. The noodle is not so big. I really dislike the noodle. I figure if I'm paying $13, you can at least provide some fresh noodle. Their noodle tastes like the dry one from a box. The noodle deserves a 2 star. It's edible though. On the opposite hand, the young reception in the front is very friendly and treat my kids well. I really appreciate her services. She deserves a 4 star. Hence, a total of 3 stars for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had garlic noodles and dumplings. First time here and the flavor was good but the food is greasy unfortunately. Definitely too much oil used. The service was great but I am not sure I would go back. First impressions are very important when selecting a restaurant. The plum wine is strong, good balance with the greasy noodles. Would come back to the bar, but not dinner."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Japanese/Chinese fusion restaurant back when it was formerly Koji....that being said I was astonished when not only was the food significantly downgraded but the service as well. To start off with, the hostess spoke very softly and in a low tone so we could not hear her when she proceeded to seat us. Then the server arrived, did not introduce himself (which I have a big pet peeve about, not a reason for the 2 star review but I thought I would throw that in there) We ordered the Veggie lettuce wraps as an appetizer and the seafood chow fun with cashew chicken substitute to brown rice. Now usually you would expect the appetizer to arrive prior to the meal correct? WRONG. We received everything at once...another big pet peeve. The food did not take long to arrive which is THE SOUL reason for the 2 stars otherwise I would have given .5 stars if possible. The server checked on us once and I asked for spicy sauce....I never received it so another gentlemen brought it 20 minutes later when I was done with the meal. We are currently waiting for our server to show up so we can ask for boxes. It's been 15 minutes and counting of said waiting....NEVER COMING BACK! RIP Koji..."}
{"text":"My order was to-go. I wanted a Mongolian lamb which they said they didn't have lamb. I then asked to prepare it the same way but with beef. They did but also didn't. They did prepare the same way that I wanted; yet, they put PORK instead of BEEF! I threw it away. I  also ordered a Sea bass tofu hot which was ok.  BEEF!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times while I am in Vegas for business in the past month, and I have to say that for a off-strip Asian restaurant that screams \"inauthentic joint - be ware!\", I've been pleasantly surprised.  Ondori may not be your authentic champion, but I think it does try a blended angle of authentic dishes paired with American diners' taste, in a nicely decorated, spacious and attractive setting.   I've always sat at the bar and bartenders/servers are very attentive and offer great service. They have nice selection of Asian beers which I like, and other Asian spirits. One time a server brought me a bai ju that was so terrible and bartender was kind enough to exchange it to a Kirin draft for free - stating that the other server had mistakenly brought a cheap bai ju that was on display solely for display purposes.   Among the foods I ordered... 1. Orleans roll - interesting take with cucumber wrap instead of rice, fish wasn't outstanding and overall taste was just ? though quantity was good. 2. BBQ pork bun - this was disappointing because the bottom part where bun meets the paper wrap was all soggy and peeling off... as if someone just hastily microwaved a frozen bun... stay away. 3. Fish with ginger & mushroom (not sure about exact name) - This was recommended by a waiter when asked for a good fish dish, and it did not disappoint. Had nice slabs of flaky fish and chewy slices of mushrooms in a light but tasty ginger sauce. Winner!  4. Oxtail hot pot - Was a bit too greasy and heavy for me... should've done sea bass hot pot. 5. Garlic scallion chicken wings - Interesting flavor but a bit too dry for my taste  I have yet to try their tapa-esque \"tomodoro\" menu because, well, the items looked decisively American-Asian... and inauthentic.. but if you're American diner I think it's a real good bet as the combination choices are hard not to like. By the way, I mean this general tip with respect for American diners. If you're one of those American diners who actually learned to enjoy authentic Chinese, by all means you might do well to stay away.   Overall, I think this place deserves recognition for trying to balance the offerings well to suit the general taste of American diners, while giving interesting options of authentic dishes for other diners. I would visit again for convenience and further exploration."}
{"text":"Please read my tip section! I don't understand why Ondori charges a fee for take out orders. Do they miss the tip and want you to dine in? I really don't understand this concept. Should be happy to get orders, when there many restaurants to pick !!! With this going on, I'm going elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Is this a Japanese or Chinese restaurant? It's actually a fusion of both!! We saw the Japanese and Chinese menus posted on the wall outside the restaurant.  We were quoted 20-30 minutes. Weird...because the place was empty. We gave them our phone number and got a call from the restaurant after 10 minutes.   Ordered kung pao chicken ($13.00) and Yang Chow fried rice ($13.00).   We knew it's Americanized when they served us complimentary crispy noodle appetizer with mustard and sweet & sour sauce. The food was okay, but my expectation was low. It was not bad for an Americanized restaurant and for the price.  3 stars!!  Ondori Asian Kitchen is almost yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. We come for the lunch specials but the service is horrible. Our server was Jennifer not once did she come introduce herself. The busser Isidro was amazing. As soon as we sat down he took our drink order and told us that Jennifer would be right with us. But she never came. 10 minutes after we got our drinks went back to the host to get another server because I was hungry and was ready to order.  The manager came right out and took my order not Jennifer. He was nice and pleasant but again no apology. We ordered the food and that was great. When it was time to cash out Jennifer was the one to drop off the check no hello no sorry about the wait nothing. After she came and dropped off he check she was no where to be seen. Again the manager came to get my payment and the hostess dropped my final receipt and card back to us.  This place is unorganized. And I don't know how Jennifer was sooo busy when she only had 3 tables including us and one table was already eating when we sat down.  The sad part is that this isn't the first experience with her. This is the 3 rd time being in her section and all 3 were horrible. I'm a sucker for good food at reasonable prices so I might be back but not if I'm in her section. I should have learned my lesson the first time but now today I did."}
{"text":"The fish collar is really delicious and many of the menu items are quit good and tasty too.  However, have eaten here twice and first time it was a 45 min wait for two of us so sat at the bar. We received two dishes that the food was severely undercooked and had to be returned. Second time we had a party of six and made reservations but restaurant was almost empty even though around the same time. Again we received a dish that was so undercooked we had to return it. Biggest issue both times (though raw, undercooked food serious) the service by the wait staff is slow at best. As with many restaurant venues in Vegas now the bus staff are great while most places, the managers, hostesses/hosts, and wait staff is slow and often not customer focused. That focus in itself would have prevented the raw food being served. The fact it happened twice and two separate occasions indicates a management problem."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise! Ordered wonton soup, a little bland.  However we had sushi for dinner, the Hawaiian Five O, the Crunchy Tempura & Who is your daddy rolls.  All three were flavorful and each of them had there own unique flavor.  They did not all taste the same (as you might find in a non Japanese sushi restaurant)"}
{"text":"Had fried rice Wong ton soup your dad sushi roll, and din sum everything was delicious"}
{"text":"Don't ever forget to ask for the Mongolian beef, which is the best here at This restaurant. The Cabernet is ok, not the best but the food was awesome. I will come back here again."}
{"text":"food:  ordered chow mein or chow fun. it's worse than panda.. taste real cheap and oily.  ordered few other things but it was just too oily- even for a chinese food.   so i ordered some rolls, they taste old..   service:   very blah,  saw my server for order and to get a check."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Orleans one night to extend our trip.  Long story short, the sushi is very average.  However, they do offer live lobster sashimi.   One caveat, this is Maine lobster, not spiny lobster, so the texture and taste is not the same.  It's ok if you're staying in the hotel, would not go out of my my otherwise.  Perhaps the chinese food is good?"}
{"text":"After a few friends recommended it, my husband and I came here for lunch.  There are several Lunch Specials for $10. that include a cup of soup, spring roll and fried rice.  We ordered the Mongolian beef, at our server's recommendation and teriyaki chicken.  We also ordered dumplings for an appetizer.  We ordered one hot and sour soup and one egg drop soup.  The egg drop soup was good, not fantastic.  The hot and sour was too sour for my liking, very \"vinegary\" tasting.  Dumplings and spring rolls were good.  The Mongolian Beef was quite flavorful.  The beef was extremely tender.  Teriyaki chicken,was quite good.  The teriyaki sauce had good flavor and broccoli was cooked nicely.  The fried rice was one of the better fried rices That I have had.  My only complaint was that service was a bit slow.  Four different people came by to take our drink order, yet it took forever for our drinks to arrive.  Once our drinks arrived, service was good.  Also, our appetizers was brought with our entree.  I would have liked it brought ahead of time."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner after a show and I was really impressed. We were seated right away and I was actually surprised it wasn't busier---this place is awesome. All the food is delicious, very fresh, and there are so many options on the menu. We wanted to sit at the bar instead of a table and we had a great dinner. Our server/bartender was great. He was very friendly, attentive, and gave us several suggestions from the menu.  I started with the hot & sour soup because I was having a craving for it. It did not disappoint. It was a little spicier than when I usually order it, which was great! Our entrees came out a couple minutes after I finished my soup. We ordered the Mongolian Beef, Snow Peas, and the Veggie Lo Mein. Everything was so good and came out piping hot. The dishes were all really big and definitely enough for two people. We actually had plenty of leftovers. I would definitely come back here. Service was great, prices were reasonable, and the food was great. If you're looking for some authentic and tasty Chinese (or Japanese food--they have a great selection on the menu) then stop by The Orleans for dinner one night."}
{"text":"Worst place to eat. Missed half of my order. Service was terrible. Never kept track of our order. Had to cancel most of our order due to never getting them.  Save yourself the headache go somewhere else. Even spilt a whole bunch of crap on me and. Never wanted to lean it up. They are shit."}
{"text":"The waiters here are awesome. They are polite and attentive. I sat at the sushi bar, and I got my order about 40 min after I ordered. I wasn't in a hurry but this definitely would not be a quick place to eat. I ordered the \"orleans roll\" and the \"sex on fire roll.\" They were both just OK. I think I will come back another time & try some different rolls. Seems like they have a great selection on the menu, and I may have just ordered the wrong thing."}
{"text":"Been to Ondori a few times and Tk, the bartender, has always been prompt and courteous. Great food and excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Half of our table did not get their food. The waitress played dumb when we asked about the rest of our food and had the nerve to ask if we \"really ordered it\".  Never coming back."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good - actually better than the hotel and casino it is housed in. They had a lobster roll that was super good. I also had my go-to, the Spider Roll, which was also very good. The service was quick and  courteous. The ambiance is clean and well  decorated in Chinese accessories. I am just glad to have this quality in this not so quality surrounding."}
{"text":"With so many choices, it was hard to decide. I ordered the cucumber salad as an appetizer. It was light and refreshing! We settled on cashew chicken and orange beef. The cashews were the best part of the dish, but the sauce and chicken lacked flavor- quite bland. Also, too many veggies and not enough chicken. The orange beef was amazing! I could eat several plates of that dish all day long!   The service was good. I'd return to try other plates."}
{"text":"For three people, we ordered so much food.. one table wasn't enough. Half of the food were good, and the rest of the half.. wasn't my style. Mixture of Chinese/Japanese.. I wasn't really digging the Chinese food here. So, 3 star it is."}
