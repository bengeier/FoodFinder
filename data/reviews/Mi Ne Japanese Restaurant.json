{"text":"I'm not sure how to give minus 1 star here but I will give you details and you can decide for you self.

I went here recently on a Sunday night and I like to make reservations since the yelp  reviews said it was small and very busy.   I showed up 10 minutes ealry and they claim I did not make reservations or called the wrong location.  I used the yelp app and it loads the phone  number automatically.   After the older lady  rudely said I never called he offered me a table with a condition of me leaving at 8.   We place our order.  since it was busy the food came out very slow.  Instead of prioritizing our order so we can leave ealier  it was in the regular que. 

Our food arrived at  7:36 and I ate as fast as I could but the next table (table of 8 so they need the booth in the back coner) was standing there watching us eat which was uncomfortable.   So I asked for a take out box and left

Instead of transferring  us to another  open table or the sushi bar which by the way was empty. 


Service -1

Food-   2/5  average at best.   I eat regularly  at yangs or sushi on 7  which has equal quailty but they are a ayce buffet    I order one of the boats.

Atmosphere  2/5    with a hundred sushi joint to chose from ...why not drive 10 minutes to markham  and get comparable ayce sushi  or quility a la carte 20 minutes away   in newmarket 

Ask the owner to contact me personal to discuss if you like. 

I eat out  quite  often and had better service at a cheap dim sum on a public holiday."}
{"text":"I personally can't reason coming here to eat sushi while in Markham and Richmond Hill I could get similar food and better portions at AYCE."}
{"text":"Had it for lunch and ordered take out.  The ladies and sushi chefs were extremely helpful and nice. I was studying the menu , trying to make a decision on what to order.  A server came to introduce the combo lunch menu which has a mixture of different rolls for a better price. 

Maki Set D ($11.95) came with 3 pieces of California Roll and 8 pieces of Dynamite Roll.  Miso Soup and Green Salad came with the lunch combo set.  Standard textures and tastes.  Ingredients were fresh and crunchy. 

Spicy Scallop Maki Roll ($6.95) and Avocado Maki Roll ($4.95) = I enjoyed the soft and melt-in-the-mouth avocado roll.  The roll was really fresh and sweet.  Tangy spicy scallop roll was enjoyable.  I find the sauce stronger and more flavourful or distinct than other sushi restaurants.  The spiciness really exists!

They serve generous roll portions.  They were big!  Eating these rolls will make you look like a goldfish, bloated cheeks and continuously chewing."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi restaurant in all of the GTA! They are so far from where I live but it's such a treat to go once in a while. Their melt in your mouth spicy salmon and spicy scallop rolls are my personal favourites!  They are almost always busy during dinner time but if you make reservations ahead of time you're good to go.  Nobody puts as much stuff in their sushi as mi-ne! Definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi restaurant. Food was okay but I wouldn't say it's great. Prices are a little high for what it was. I didn't like that they only give you an hour to eat. It's not really a place you go to hang out with people. It's eat and go place. Nothing was bad about the place though.  It would return if I was in the mood for sushi that's higher quality than ayce type of food."}
{"text":"We ordered a boat combination sushi and Shrimp tempra set for our late dinner. Since received several friends highly recommendation we were very excited for a nice sushi night. However, Serving with poor taste Japanese tea and Miso soup we instantly noticed that we won't have a dinner as expected. Although sushi rolls were kind of big size but taste was not very special. Sushi arrangement was not very sophisticated way means not even pieces for two persons. Tempra was very sorry. Poor oil quality spoiled shrimp taste. It need more improvement for oil. We supposed to try eat at the counter seat but not open for customers. This is my first time sushi restaurant does not have customer at the counter. Hope some improvement and able to come back enjoining a great sushi."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favourite Japanese restaurants! I've been coming here for over 10 years and I have never left unsatisfied. The staff here are very kind and friendly too. The food quality is amazing- the size of the rolls are huge and the presentation of their dishes are very tidy and the rolls don't easily fall apart like a lot of restaurants I've been to. Though the prices are higher, you cannot beat the freshness and quality they have at Mi-Ne! This is the restaurant that started my love of Japanese food! I'm so glad it's close to home!"}
{"text":"All my friends rave about this sushi restaurant and I finally went to try! It's a small little place which gets super busy and owned and runned by Koreans. 

Went with 3 other friends and we ordered the Love Boat and a Tempura Udon. The boat came with sashimi, sushi and rolls. Total of about 32 pieces of sushi and 18 pieces of sashimi. Sashimi slices are nice and thick and very fresh. Their torched butter fish is to die for! It just melts in your mouth! The rolls are quite large in size, good ratio of rice and filling, very yummy. The udon and the broth were pretty good as well. Came with big pieces of shrimp and vegetable tempura. We were all stuffed and very satisfied. 

Even though the menu is on the pricey side, the quality and taste is definately worth it. Would definately recommend friends to try! Might be smart to make reservations though since they are usually pretty busy."}
{"text":"Mi Ne is definitely a local favourite (and mine too!) - the restaurant is always busy during peak lunch and dinner times. Their lunch specials are the best value for the quality of the food they serve. Although the menu has nothing super fancy, they do the staples very well. 

This time, we ordered: 
- unagi roll and salmon roll (6 pieces each): The rolls are huge and more than a mouthful (no exaggeration!) The ratio of the unagi to the cucumber/avocado was a little off though - I had to take two bites in order to taste the unagi. Delicious anyhow!
- salmon lover combo: Perfect for anyone who loves salmon - this comes with sashimi, nigiri, 3 piece roll, and salmon teriyaki on a bed of grilled veggies. I recommend this if you have a big appetite because it's a lot of food. 

They recently refreshed the restaurant a bit and the tables in the middle now have dividers in between them, which makes the dining experience much better because you're not elbow to elbow with complete strangers. 

Service has always been prompt and friendly! I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite sushi restaurant in town. Their sushi is always fresh and consistently well prepared. They also have some of the largest rolls I have ever seen and the flavour profile of each one is spectacular. The menu is very extensive and is sure to please any taste. Service is always friendly and top-notch. Atmosphere is cozy, intimate, and inviting. A true jewel in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite sushi spots. The food is always fresh & delicious. The service always friendly & courteous & chefs are wonderful with their creations. Love me some Mi Ne!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent small japanese sushi restaurant. The atmosphere is quiet and pleasant. It takes a while for your sushi to be prepared, but one they are read you will love how they taste and look."}
{"text":"great lunch spot for sushi. 

the lunch specials are good value - and the prep is great. cuts of fish are on par with places that charge more. Quality of fish is excellent. very tasty.

ambiance is great too. they have little booths like many sushi places I have eaten at.

service is super fast - you can get out of her pretty quick at lunchtime.

have eaten here a bunch of times and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves such delicious sushi that I drive from Mississauga to eat here. The best rolls are Orangville, Alaska, AS dragon roll and Richmond Roll. The rolls are huge and the fish is generous. My only complaint is the service. You always feel rushed since the servers are constantly checking to see if you're finished and the second you eat your last bite, they whisk away you're plate and give you a bill. They are also extremely unfriendly."}
{"text":"Very good Japanese food!  Super fresh fish and vegetables.  Friendly staff and fast service.  Best in Richmond hill"}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant on a Saturday early afternoon. Even though all the tables were full, our party of 4 patiently stood by the door for 15 minutes without being greeted or acknowledged by ANY of the staff. It's also worth mentioning that there were no other patrons waiting in line in front of us. 

There was one staff member attending to the phone with a difficult customer, two waitresses, and a team of chefs who work right by the door; Not one staff member nodded our way or offered menus for us to look over while waiting. 

We were really excited to try this place out, but it didn't look like they wanted anyone else in the restaurant. We walked out and visited the burger joint next door. Will not be returning, the service was sub par."}
{"text":"Do not like this place - bad service , sushi made is extra-large pieces which some people might like, but it's really just a lot of rice and not much in between - can't get the satisfaction of flavours.  Don't bother with getting a seat and the waiter being friendly to you during peak dinner time hours"}
{"text":"Definitely the best option locally (not competing with all the ayce places). 

The sushi has consistently been fresh, vibrant, and flavourful. This place is reliable and delicious. Their decor is a little more upscale than others around it, making it a popular date restaurant, but it's still pretty casual. I usually prefer sashimi/chirashi which is good here, but their rolls are really a standout highlight. They're huge, decorative, and you can actually taste the individual flavours in them instead of it becoming a giant mush. One 'special' roll can definitely be enough for a meal. Just watch out because they're so big they're kinda hard to eat. Also, lovely service every time.

Prices are a little higher, around $10- $15 for a big roll."}
{"text":"3.5*
Sushi was great, service could have been better. Restaurant is quite small, so definitely make reservations. I do prefer this restaurant more than dine-in.

Came with couple friends for dinner on Saturday night. It was around 6pm so we waited for about 10 mins or so, which wasn't too bad at bad. We were seated in one of the further corners and pretty tucked away, so the server may have forgotten about us- we didn't get menu and tea until we asked them multiple times. Same situation with refilling tea and paying the bill, it got a little bit frustrating.

Food itself was great. We ordered 2 rolls (~$12-$14) and maki (~$7) and small sashimi boat (~$23). It was all very fresh and the sushi portions were quite massive, yet not filled with a lot of rice which was a big plus.

I think I will stick with takeout as I do still enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I've been here for both lunch and dinner and I highly recommend the restaurant. It can be busy if you come at peak hours, so expect a lineup. Their rolls are large and very tasty (very filling as well). I usually get the Orangeville roll. I also recommend their mushroom soup as an appetizer... it has two dumplings in it as well! I like the service and overall a great sushi location in RHill."}
{"text":"Mushroom soup is the best in GTA. 
Maki sushi are larger then regular ones, but very tasty. 
Been there with my family at least dozen times. 
Weekends and evenings are usually busy so make a reservation."}
{"text":"Mi-Ne is an average sushi place. We went there for dinner at least 5-6 times and if nothing else they are consistent in regards to quality and service. I must say I had better sushi elsewhere. Soya sauce served in bottles is watered down ... I don't know why they do that? We had to order soya sauce in small bags ... pretty weird for sushi restaurant. Considering the quality of Mi-Ne's food, this joint could be much less expensive."}
{"text":"Decades of eating, safe to say the staple in Richmond-Hill next to Tomo. Great quality.. Call in advance for dining and take-out, worth the wait."}
{"text":"I just love the sushi here. If I could eat it every day, I would. You will not find fresher elsewhere. A great lunch special. Only down side it's tiny and busy."}
{"text":"Been using this restaurant since I moved to around Yonge and Elgin Mills about 11 years ago. It's been always my first choice for Sushi but I was really disappointed for their customer service tonight. I ordered a chicken teriyaki dinner and other menu items but ended up getting a half cooked chicken. I had to drive all the way back to pick up the same food and I'm not 100% sure if they're really sorry about what they had done. They ruined my dinner schedule. But they didn't offer anything but a replacement. What a great service!"}
{"text":"Consistently great food!  Make reservations if you're eating in, as the location is small.  Wish they delivered, but it's worth picking up!"}
{"text":"My home town before I moved to North York! I love this place! My favourite and best sushi. Clean and place to meet up with my friends whenever I head down a bit north."}
{"text":"This is my go-to japanese restaurant. Absolutely delicious! Their rolls are the best and my favourite is the Orangeville roll. The sushi is gigantic and is well worth it for the price you are paying. I gave this 4 stars because the cooked for isnt as good as other places but i usually go for the sushi."}
{"text":"I really like the quality of this place. Very large variety of unique rolls. Staff is friendly, but when they get busy they kind of fall behind. The restaurant is small without fancy interior, but still gets 5 stars for what it is."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi place yet and I have been here several times over the years. The rolls are large, servers are attentive. The sushi rice is particularly good as it is a bit sweet and I have not found another sushi restaurant that compares!"}
{"text":"The Sushi is great. It's the best sushi in my opinion.

sushi - 10/10
place - 7/10 ( I think they should make it nicer)
service- 8/10

For sure going back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location (each of the restaurants are owned by different people!). Their sushi is OK but it's the service that puts me off. They never smile, when asked for extra cutlery, the waiters just come and throw them on the table, no reply when they are thanked! Wish there was an alternative to this sushi place nearby so that I can take my son who loves sushi!"}
{"text":"This place is great, I really love it. I would strongly recommend you try it. I came here with my kids and I didn't have to entertain them at all. They loved the food and the staff was very understanding of my young son not being able to sit in on place."}
{"text":"Ordered a love boat(sashimi+sushi+rolls). Nothing special but had better quality but lower price in some other Japanese restaurants"}
{"text":"Very good and fresh sashimi here.  The Dragon roll was huge and the portion size for the combo meals are big.  Excellent service! I really like this place and would highly recommend it as my go to sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"We sat in a booth making the experience intimate, would have hated to sit in the rows of tables in the centre of the place. I believe we ordered the Salmon Lovers meal which is for 2 people. All I can say is after you order this you probably won't eat salmon for a week. I was all Salmoned out by the end of it, I shouldn't have ordered the extra sushi pizza light LOL! So much food! Everything was great! The service was impeccable! The one thing that didn't meet my standards was the salmon sashimi, although cut to a decent size, I found it didn't melt in my mouth like I'm accustomed too. Weird because the salmon sushi was amazing... So was it worth the $80+ hummmm I know for sure the company that night was, but next time I visit I won't be getting any \"lovers\" meals! I'd order a la carte!"}
{"text":"Being one who absolutely LOVES Sushi/Sashimi, I could pass up the opportunity to go for a sushi dinner when my husband and I were invited out by a friend.  

This is the first time being at Mi-Ne Japanese Restaurant for dinner, it had nicely decorated private booths that could seat four people quite comfortably, although the isles were a little bit on the narrow side.  

The service was good and the food was excellent, you definitely got what you paid for, big portions and melt in mouth, fresh pieces of sashimi.  I can't wait for the next time I have sushi for dinner, it was just soooo good."}
{"text":"I only give a 2 star, because there are way many better choices than MiNe in Richmond Hill area. Same price with higher quality food. If you want to experience overall Japanese cruise besides sushi, then look for Japanese Izakaya place instead."}
{"text":"Neat place but a bit small. Food is fast and delicious but a little expensive. The portion of the dinner course for two is average."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to describe how good this sushi place is. Seriously. I drive 30 mins plus to eat here regularly. Well worth it. It's AMAZING. Best sushi in the GTA, hands down."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and enjoyed a Maki combo lunch special for 11.95, which included 8 pieces dynamite roll and 3 piece california roll. Rolls were well made, not too much rice, and were filled with ingredients. Combo came with soup and salad as well. Great deal

We also ordered the Orangeville roll. Must try! Huge 8 piece roll stuffed with avocado, tobiko, spicy scallop, and crab meat, topped with salmon. SO GOOD. And well worth the price (14.95)

Definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"Love the spicy roll set. Great presentation."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, food is always great.  Service can range.  Order less than usual rolls are huge"}
{"text":"Been eating here for over 10 years, was my favourite spot! when the previous owners sold years ago the restaurant went downhill big time!! I don't mind paying top dollar for good sushi but this place is not worth the money at all. I use to dine in and get take out at least once a week ($200 worth of take-out for my family) and when i would come pick up the food and ask for some spicy mayo they actually had the decency to charge me for some hot sauce(pretty sad). Don't go there anymore , much better options in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Cute little place uptown with very friendly, attentive staff.  Though the prices are a little higher than average, the sizes of the maki and hand rolls are really worth it.  

Edamame - A little on the salty side, but they were good and perfectly cooked.  Serving was also pretty generous and is shareable between 3 people.  4/5.

Salmon Sashimi - We went during lunch and I was a little surprised with the size as some place, tend to cut them smaller.  This wasn't the case at Mi Ne.  They were also very fresh. 5/5.

Yam Tempura Roll - Different but pretty good.  Any vegetarian would enjoy this. 4/5.

Avocado Roll - Any lover of avocado would love it.  Pieces were also very big and satisfying. 5/5.

Spicy Rainbow Dragon Roll - My apologies if the name is a little off but I believe that this is a new item.  What I do remember is how much I thoroughly enjoyed this roll.  I was shocked to see a full piece of shrimp tempura at the ends and I'm talking about a FULL piece.  Each end. The roll was huge! If you like spicy mayo, I suggest asking for extra.  Otherwise, the roll was fantastic.  5/5."}
{"text":"This place has a great quality sushi with great service. The only thing on the downside is that it is pretty on the pricey side of the sushi restaurants in Markham."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI SPOT IN MARKHAM! Whenever you're having a sushi craving, you can always count on MINE to provide you with quality cuts of fish and generous portions. 

I love everything about this restaurant. The ambiance, the service...but especially the food! I got a sushi set of 7 piece nigiri and 6 pieces of salmon maki. The salmon maki is gigantic and the thick cuts of nigiri really fills you up. I also tried the avocado and crab meat salad which was super fresh and DELICIOUSSS! 

Mine is amazing! Everyone in Markham needs to try this restaurant at least once in their life."}
{"text":"I love this place - from the food to the customer service, everything about Mi-Ne is perfect. I've been a regular customer here for over 5 years and I have never once been disappointed with the quality of my meals. 

I'm very particular when it comes to sushi but I honestly cannot find any faults with Mi-Ne. The fish is always fresh and sliced at a nice thickness (not paper-thin like you often get at AYCE sushi places). For the sushi, the rice is seasoned to perfection - not too salty and not too bland. Personally, I like my sushi to have more fish and less rice so I find that Mi-Ne sushi has the perfect fish to rice ratio. The variety of fish they serve is also amazing.

The customer service here is also great. I like my maki rolls a very specific way (e.g. using a specific sauce, replacing some of the contents) and they were very accommodating. They even went beyond my expectations by having my custom order memorized for my next visit. 

Mi-Ne is on the pricier side, for sure, but you definitely get what you paid for! I highly recommend the Love Boat (comes with sushi, sashimi and maki rolls) and the Golden Dragon roll!"}
{"text":"EXPERIENCE
Always a pleasant experience to dine in or to take out from this restaurant. The food is always fresh. Staff is always friendly. 

WISHLIST
The only thing I wished they had was delivery and all you can eat. 

CON: PARKING
There's definitely not enough parking when you have California Sandwiches, Joes Hamburgers, and a doctors office in the same little plaza. There's parking all around the little plaza surrounding this building but still isn't enough."}
{"text":"Though slightly more expensive than the typical sushi places that seem to be popping up all over the GTA, Mi-NE is worth the splurge for the freshness of the ingredients and generosity with ingredients. 

I had lunch there. My companion and I had the spicy tuna/sushi combo along with the sashimi lunch set. The miso soup tasted substantially better than what I usually get. It was smoother and though I'm not a miso expert, I dare say it wasn't made from an instant powder. The spicy rolls came packed with fish and tiny tempura bits. Being a spicy maki  connoisseur I'm often disappointed with rolls that skimp on fish and load up the rice. 

The white and red tuna from the sashimi set came slightly seared which was a nice surprise. The raw fish was very fresh. 

It was a standout lunch. Will have to try dinner some time."}
{"text":"Been waiting to try this place out and it didn't disappoint! We went on a Saturday around 1pm and it was quite busy so that was a good sign to start off with. We got the salmon lover's bento, an Orangeville roll and a lunch sushi set that came with 5 pieces of sushi and a golden dragon roll (dynamite roll topped with salmon). Lot of food for two people since their portions are generous. Salmon sashimi was sliced thickly and was so fresh and buttery. My favourite was the Orangeville roll, so many flavours and textures! The bill came up to be around $58 before tax and tip so a bit more expensive than your average sushi lunch but definitely worth it once in a while. Can't wait to return to try the rest of the menu :)"}
{"text":"came for happy hour time which is at 2:30-5. i ordered tempura appetizer, mushroom soup with hot stone, Orangeville roll,smoky roll and hamachi sashimi. Mushroom is very hot and tasty. The portion of tempura is huge, it's worth for $17. Hamachi sashimi should be 3 pieces but they gave me one extra piece so I got 4 pieces and it was so fresh. The rolls were great but could not finish all of them. I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Solid quality for sashimi and sushi for the price you pay. Went during lunch, found their lunch specials to be reasonably priced. I got the sashimi bento box, which was not bad with 13 pcs sashimi for $13.95. Sashimi slices were fresh and nice and thick, just the way it's supposed to be. I also found their sushi rolls decent - not too much rice and a decent chunk of filling. I also liked that the complimentary miso soup was not overly salted like in many other restaurants.

It is a small Korean-run establishment that can get quite busy and a bit of a wait, though service was attentive enough. Location is also a bit out of the way for me. If you are a large group, this is probably not the best place (tables are for about 2-6 people).

Otherwise, I think this is a great place to get your sushi fix. I would love to try more rolls next time!"}
{"text":"Good food, but service is hit or miss. Sometimes great sometimes really bellow average, even rude at times. They are stingy with their ginger when you ask for extra. Used to be an A+ place for food AND service but due to management change that is no longer the case."}
{"text":"Loved it!
As far as I know this place is the best sushi place in all of the GTA.
Prompt, friendly service. Fresh delicious sushi and huge portions."}
{"text":"It was my first time at this location. I usually go to the Markham one and this one in comparison seem to be much smaller in size of the restaurant.

Food quality is pretty consistent. Always love Mi Ne for its gigantic maki rolls. I like that their rolls are mainly ingredients instead of rice. I came here for lunch and I like that they are organized and have a separate menu just for lunch specials/combinations. Also, meals comes with complimentary soup and salad. 

Service was slow as they only had one person serving the entire restaurant. When we arrived, it wasn't busy but tables definitely filled up by the time we finished. Overall, had a pleasant experience. One downfall was they miscalculated our bill and gave us incorrect change back."}
{"text":"Mi-Ne Sushi never fails to disappoint with their food. Both R-Hill and Markham locations are always consistent with their sushi, being fresh and generous in portion size. It's easy to think that a non-AYCE place won't be as filling and pricey, but Mi-Ne is quite the opposite. One golden dragon roll is enough to make me full in a matter of a few pieces. 

For the first time, I've tried their lunch special bento box with salmon teriyaki. Again, the sushi that comes with the meal is super big in size and fresh. But I must say, I was slightly disappointed with the bento box. The salmon was super small, and the rice was barely enough to get two spoonfuls out of. They also gave a sample size portion of mushrooms and zucchini... which I thought was really random. 

Regardless, I still love this place and it's definitely my go-to when I'm craving for some sushi. Their sushi boat is seriously the best thing ever. Usually I'd give 5 stars but the bento box has caused for the loss in a star. I would definitely recommend this place anyways!"}
{"text":"One of the best affordable Japanese restaurants in GTA. Its not AYCE but its not as expensive as highend places like Nami in Toronto and yet satisfaction will be guaranteed. Properly prepared sushi and higher quality than most restaurants I go to."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of sushi places in the GTA and so far this has been one of the better I've had.

I'll admit, I rarely actually order sushi or maki because I'm more of sashimi person but this has been the first time I'd take their rolls over their sashimi (not that their sashimi is by any means bad, but let's just say if I only had $20 bucks on me I'm getting the green dragon roll.) The first time I took a bite out of that roll, all I could say after was, \"wow.\"

The sashimi is delicious, almost buttery. The surf clam sashimi is not all chewy like you'd normally get most subpar sushi places and the salmon is soft and and has a smooth taste. The rest of the sashimi dinner was just as good, definitely worth the $22 price tag.

Even the salad was good. Even the salad!

I wouldn't recommend  this is a place for serious sushi enthusiasts as everything is pretty saucy but as an average Joe who likes to eat good tasting things, this place gets 4 stars because its that goddamn tasty.

As for the restaurant itself, it does get really packed during dinner. Expect to wait. The restaurant is small  and the seats are really crammed together."}
{"text":"Sushi used to be just an average experience for me. Although I quite enjoyed it, I never quite experience such good quality before which made me fall in love a little deeper. They have a very authentic feel of the culture with booths and traditional decor. Overall It's very tasty and filling. I don't usually return to restaurants unless it's that good. I usually order the Orangeville and sushi/sashimi combo. It comes with soup and salad. I can never eat at all you can eat or average sushi places again. When I'm stuck in that situation I'm always day dreaming about MI NE"}
{"text":"On a recommendation of a good friend for dinner, and the fact that my wife LOVES sushi, we came here for a change and that it was close to our movie theater. I had the lobster/shrimp tempura rolls ($22) and my wife had the sushi/sashimi combo ($15). Both the presentations and serving amounts were more than impressive, I'll never get tired of sushi set ups on platters or plates and how they go such lengths to make it artful, to the point that you don't want to ruin the beautifully decorated plate. Except that hunger calls and things MUST come to an end, and it did! With every savoury mouthful, dipped in a mix of soy sauce and wasabi, OMG! I'm not much of a sushi freak, that I won't go out of my way to have it or find it, but I ate my words and every bite this evening and probably will be back for more. As for my wife, aside of offering some pieces of her plate, there wasn't a word throughout her whole meal. If you feel or CRAVE sushi, I recommend Mi Ne for a memorable experience as well as personable service and ambiance."}
{"text":"Mi-Ne hasn't disappointed yet. All their sushi and sashimi are fresh and presented very nicely. 

If I had to complain, I'd say that their seating is a bit cramped, and they NEVER have the sesame ice cream available!!! We go to  so far to Mi-Ne juuuuust for the ice cream.

Otherwise, it's a great sushi restaurant to go, reasonable prices and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hmmm, seems like I must have had a stroke and forgotten to review one of my favourite hometown sushi joints ever. I've been here so many times and yet I've forgotten to give them some review love? For shame Kris U, for shame.

I'll start by letting you know, this is NOT AYCE, it's quality, sit down, take your time and enjoy your Japanese eats and sushi, not just eat as much sashimi as you can before the next order arrives. It's awesome, so pay the extra $$ and enjoy every bite!

It's been awhile since I've been back and I had heard that the original owner had sold off his interests in this location before opening the Aurora location - could be true, can't verify it so if the team at Mi Ne is reading this let us all know. 

Regardless of change or not I've been before and after the apparent shift and I noticed no change in quality - still superb from your first sip of Miso soup and salad to you last shakey bite of your love boat. 

Let me tell you about the love boat actually. Two kinds of people eat the love boat in all it's glory. 1) People in love and friends who can share (I can't share), and 2) People sad that they don't have love, so they eat this solo and cry into their green tea about how their life has gone wrong. Kris U (aka me) in 2012/13 was definitely #2 (single tear). On more than one occasion I fat shamed myself after taking down a love boat and a specialty roll. I'm not sad that it happened, I'm actually kinda proud.

If you're into quality cuts of sushi and trust my memory of this place, pay them a visit, just north of Elgin Mills and Yonge in Richmond Hill!

Oh yeah and....

EATCREST OUT!"}
{"text":"Mi-Ne is my go-to place for sushi in Richmond Hill. It isn't necessarily cheap but I think you get what you pay for. The spicy salmon rolls are THE best. 

Not a fan of the service, it's pretty sub-par. I don't think I've ever not had to stand up and ask for my bill when we're ready to pay. I enjoy getting take-out from here much more for that exact reason. Also, the seating is quite limited (although I've never experienced a super long wait)."}
{"text":"As Mill Pond area resident - this is our favorite sushi place. Food always fresh and prices are very reasonable eapecially at lunch time. Service is very good and quality is much better than in all-you-can-eat style places."}
{"text":"This is my favourite and go to place for rolls.  I'm a regular here whether for dine-in or take out.  

This is a small Korean run Japanese restaurant with some of the freshest rolls I've ever tasted.  My favourite is their California roll: the seaweed is fresh and the cucumbers and tobiko make it nice and crunchy.  Portion size for these rolls are quite decent as well.  The price at this restaurant errs a bit on the high side, but the quality is well worth it.  Service is... meh.... you always have to get their attention to refill your tea.  however, the food is good enough for me to come back.

Tip:  on fri/sat nights, make reservations by phone in advance to guarantee a spot, I believe they have a 1 hr or 1 hr and 30 min maximum sitting time.  You can also request for a booth for a bit of privacy."}
{"text":"Been here many times. I have to give them 5/5 for food because it is the best sushi place I've ever been to. I guess you get what you pay for. It is definitely a pricier sushi place but it is definitely worth it! The restaurant is very clean and looks like a traditional Japanese restaurant. Even the workers are Japanese! The only thing I didn't like was the service. I had to tell the waitresses 3 times that I wanted my bill (waited 30 mins in total for my bill and no they weren't busy. I just felt ignored). Minus the service, it's 4/5 overall"}
{"text":"Mi Ne is easily the best Japanese restaurant in and around Richmond Hill. The food is always delicious, fresh and well prepared.

We  revisit this restaurant all the time and not only enjoy seated dining, but also love the take out for gatherings at home. 

We always feel very welcome by both the hosts and the chef's, whom are never too busy to graciously accept our compliments.

I particularly like their version of Spicy Miso Soup, which we never find elsewhere. We usually follow the soup with an Enoki Mushroom Yaki and a roll. All are perfectly prepared.

We rarely find any rival to Mi Ne, with the exception of a couple of very upmarket restaurants with prices that far exceed Mi Ne."}
{"text":"This A La Carte restaurant gets 4/5 stars in my books. As I've been to plenty of sushi places all around Ontario this one definitely sets itself apart.

There are 3 locations for Mi-Ne which I've visited and each one does well each time. 

The service is not always on point (differs from location) but is good enough, depends on the day.

Also, in some locations the waitresses/waiters can be called through a pager which is convenient.

Prices are decent as they are equivalent to what you are receiving. The rolls are larger than most normal roll and have a very distinct fresh taste to them

This location has a good atmosphere and has amazing quality sushi along fresh rolls.

Definitely recommended and something to check out while in Richmond Hill



Toronto Food Review"}
{"text":"Spicy Salmon is amazing if they make it well with not too much salmon. Yam roll is great (especially when they give you some sweet potato fries and spicy mayo on the side. Great place, great environment (especially the booths). Only downfall is no delivery, only pickup."}
{"text":"I've been in this Japanese Restaurant couple of times in the past couple of years (last time yesterday).  

Same good sushi and rolls.  May be the size is a little too big for my taste, but yummy.  This place is a bit on the pricey side, but quality of food is good.

Overall the place is good."}
{"text":"The sushi was very, very fresh. The service was friendly. Decor is cute. Food is reasonably priced. 

Only complaint would be the \"Kenny G Covers The World's Sappiest Songs\" musak playing in the background. But the food is so good it's easily tuned-out."}
{"text":"We ordered lunch from here to go. Quick and good customer service. Food is delicious and correct. The presentation of the food look amazing. I'd definitely recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Average for me. Sushi was definitely fresh but I don't like the over sized rolls at all. Don't get me wrong, I love big portions :) , but the large rolls fall apart and become too chewy. Sashimi was also thick if you like that. Service was on the slow side but polite. Went mid-day and the place was full."}
{"text":"Mi Ne is our go-to sushi restaurant in Richmond Hill and has been for years. The quality is absolutely unmatched. They use great quality ingredients and the presentation is top notch. The prices reflect someone who is looking for sushi that isn't a \"fill up my food bucket to the brim\" kind of person. Every time I order from here I never think I've ordered enough, but by the time you get to he end of your second roll, you're quite happy with the amazing quality and enormous size of each piece."}
{"text":"Food is very fresh and big portion but too many people. I have to wait more than half a hour for just a take-out. Maybe I came a bad time. But I still recommend this place."}
{"text":"I visited this place base on recommendations.  It isn't as close as \"Gal Sushi\" (downstairs of my building) but it's worth the drive.  Call me lazy :)  I'm kind of close to Elgin Mills and Yonge St. but I would come again and again.

My girlfriend and I visited on Family Day...Yes, they're open on Holidays.  Don't think Asians care for Holidays...a plus!

As told from our waitress, they've got a new menu.  We were impress with the choices.  Great lunch menu alone that had its own menu.  They have sushi, maki, sashimi, rice, and udon bento combo.  Also, a menu with dinner specials, a la cartes, and couple combos.

We decided to stay away from their specials cause we wanted to try something unique.  We ordered Oyster soup, Unagi (Eel) Roll, Yam Tempura Roll,  and 14 assorted Sashimi.  They threw in 3 pieces of California and spicy rolls.  We loved the oyster soup, very flavourful and filled with good portion seafood.  Spicy roll and unagi roll was delicious, tightly rolled to perfection.  Sashimi was fresh and cut perfectly.  

Service and decor was cute.  Private areas with Japanese separators.  They've got a great selection of food, which is always good!"}
{"text":"Came for Friday lunch specials (woot woot). 

Got the impression that this was gonna be mind blowing since it's been number 1 on Yelp in Richmond Hill for a bit. When we got there it was full and VERY busy. Waited around 10-15 minutes for a table. The person serving us was quite friendly so that's good. Ordered the Chicken Teriyaki Box (only $7.95! where can you find that now a days for jap food?) and Sashimi box. 

Food tasted fresh and was overall quite delicious with the exception of the noodles. They just tasted off. 

Prices are good, food is good"}
{"text":"Mi Ne had very original decor with Japanese inspired seating booths with bamboo drapes to allow for privacy! Too cute, would be an ideal date spot.

We came here for lunch when it wasn't too crowded, I tried the shrimp tempura (4/5) which I have an allergic reaction to this dish (which is random for me as I each seafood all the time- broke into light hives on my skin) but that's not to deter people from trying this wonderful dish.  The sushi is of good quality and pretty large for its portions, so 1 handroll is plenty for each person. The service is quick, they also do take out."}
{"text":"It is usually a good place to eat sushi.  But I booked a takeout once with all the brown avocado inside California rolls. Takeout doesn't mean the client won't know what inside the food. Felt be cheated!"}
{"text":"Great, delicious sushi! No AYCE and quite expensive for the value, but definitely a good choice if you want to have some delicious sushi! Cool decor and nice staff. Wish there was AYCE so I could go here more-- been there only once but was good overall!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients , great taste ,
service is good , reasonable prices 

restrooms need updating

will come back"}
{"text":"First time having lunch with the family. Food was great. We ordered bento boxes which was amazing and tasty. Service was also excellent. Very recommendable. Price was good for the food we ordered."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Richmond Hill. Best signature rolls. Good service. Always come back!"}
{"text":"Parking in the little mall is pretty limited with tight spaces.

Went for dinner and luckily no lineup but the 2 waitresses working was too busy to acknowledge us standing and waiting to be seated. Even after getting seated, it took them forever to come take our order. One was too busy on the phone while the other was making sure another table was paying by hovering over them and to clean off the table. Suffice it to say, service is not up to par.

Food wise, the sushi and sashimi was fresh but not excessively better than most places. Will give marks for the rolls though, a wider variety than most and taste was pretty good. 

Overall at this price level, it didn't impress enough. No dessert with the meal where most places at this price point for combos would atleast give you small green tea ice cream. Rather pay a few dollars more for Inatei or at similar price point, Gal's sushi."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here recently and this is still my favourite sushi restaurant in Toronto. The maki rolls are made well, as always, with little rice and generous amounts of filling. I am always impressed with everything I order - maki roll varieties, sashimi, chirashi and their crispy, flaky tempura batter."}
{"text":"I've been here around 7 times, and each time their sushi is up to par. The fish is fresh and the rolls are always well made. The restaurant itself is cozy and cute, and the service is good too. :) 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Cosy atmosphere and attentive service
The special rolls are very large! (Don't over order those)
Mushroom soup is nothing special, a bit too salty (good for sharing among 2 ppl)
Oyster soup has slightly less tasteful broth than mushroom but has plenty of seafood"}
{"text":"Had the uragi sushi and the sashimi platter. While it is on the expensive side, the portions are quite large. Really enjoyed my meal and will be coming back in the future!!"}
{"text":"I didn't really like this place. Maybe I'm just picky about my sushi, but I felt like it was one of those places where their rolls are too big. There was too much rice to everything else ratio. Aside from that, the prices were good and the food was good. I do like my maki rolls, but this place made them with too much rice."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I've had. I even crave their California rolls because they take it to the next level. It is pricey, but this is an example of you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I've been going here for months. It's amazing. 

I hate their parking lot because it's hard to get in, out, or find a spot at busy hours of the day (when everyone's off from work). I easily resolve this problem by parking at Leon's, it's directly beside Mi Ne. 

There's something in that sushi because I wake up in the middle of the night and crave it. Okay fine. But I definitely salivate just thinking about that salmon.

My favorites:
-spicy salmon pizza
- spicy salmon hand roll and maki
- mushroom soup
- tempura (shrimp)
- green salad (with avocado and tangy sauce)
- kanisu salad (this is delicious!! You've never had anything like it.
- orangeville roll. 

Wish they had
- spring rolls and glass noodles. I know it's not Japanese but it would be a great addition to the menu.

Chefs are friendly and while it's a small place, it's cozy and the food is amazing. They must put crack in that sushi because you'll be thinking about it later... I warned you."}
{"text":"Big size sushi with good quality ingredients. Id say it's pretty cheap. The service is kind of slow"}
{"text":"I went here on a Wednesday night with a couple of my friends. The place is pretty small but cute because of the sectioned booths around the sides. There was definitely some effort put into decorating the place. 
We sat in one of these very comfortable booths. Only downside is that the waiters/waitresses avoid you when they clearly see that you're calling for them...
We ordered assorted tempura, udon, green dragon roll, avo-q (avocado and cucumber), and a shrimp tempura roll. The tea was kind of cold and didn't have much flavour to it. I was hoping for either green tea or rice tea.
The tempura and udon came shortly after we ordered. The tempura was crispy but I would've liked larger vegetable pieces and maybe not pepper. 
After waiting around 30+ minutes and noticing that the restaurant wasn't too busy either, we decided to ask for the other rolls. They did come after another 10 minutes but I think this was because they wanted to serve all the rolls together. The rolls were delicious and very filling. 
We had the bill split into fours so it was $13.50 per person. This place is kind of pricier than most restaurants but its good for the quality. 
Will return."}
{"text":"My favourite Japanese/Korean restaurant in the city. Fresh and done just right.  My faves include sushi, sashimi and the yummy salmon/avocado rolls."}
{"text":"I had a lot of trouble deciding whether to rate this restaurant 3 or 4 stars. I went with 3.5, rounded down because service or ambiance didn't stand out to me as being above ordinary.

In terms of food, we got the kalbi beef appetizer which was very tender. We also tried the orangeville roll, caterpillar, and torched roll. My favourite of the three was the torched roll, followed by orangeville, and then caterpillar (least unique one). The rolls are huuuuge, which some enjoy - but I find that it makes it hard to eat one piece altogether. When you have to eat your piece in two bites, you don't get the full flavour combination at once. Nonetheless, I found the rolls to be very tasty and certainly wouldn't be opposed to coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times and it never gets old. You can't go wrong with the rolls. A good amount of selections and so far I haven't found a bad one on the menu."}
{"text":"It's a great restaurant with amazing variety of sushi and rolls. Don't order the spicy chicken. It was disappointing. Just plain, unseasoned piece of chicken drizzled with Tabasco sauce. I expected better from this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed when I come here! We were a group of 7 and ordered the large sashimi boat (60pc), (from left to right in pic) spicy salmon roll, Alaska roll, Tuna Lover roll, EST Roll, and four Uni sushi pieces. All the sushi is good, but I absolutely love and recommend their spicy salmon (that's my fav sushi roll anywhere tbh) and the EST roll. I don't like uni, but my friends say it's really good here! The sashimi boat also came with 2pc raw oysters and they were huge so that's a plus for whoever likes oysters. 

We also ordered the Agedashi Tofu which comes in 6pc (also recommend) and an order of 6pc Shrimp Tempura, it's good but very pricey at $15. 

The service is great and although the restaurant was full with people waiting for tables that night, our orders came pretty fast. The sushi is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Nice little booths, and suishi was delicious and presentation was great! Hot sake came in a lovely tea pot where it kept nice and hot"}

Strikeouts-0/3

We've been here twice and each time, and each time it's been a pleasure. Exceptional service, and people here are actually Japanese. This place isn't that large, but don't let that deter you from making group plans. They were very accommodating for birthday parties and such. The specialty here is the rolls, the size is HUGE. Much bigger than your typical restaurant and the taste is there to back it up. The rice is done right, the seaweed actually sticks, and the roll actually stays all together. Quite honestly, We've never seen a restaurant make rolls this well in all of the GTA. This exact location is actually worth the travel if you're not looking for the authentic Japanese cuisine, but the westernized Japanese cuisine. That is why if you compare this place to any other just normal mom&pop japanese restaurants, this one takes the cake.

Definitely come to this restaurant! I would definitely book ahead if you go during prime time."}
{"text":"Always happy to eat here! Awesome quality sushi. Slightly higher on the price side though.

I usually come at lunch when it's a little cheaper. Overall at least 9/10 for the taste."}
{"text":"Probably the best rolls I've ever had, we order in from here frequently but rarely dine in. My partner and I came here after a massage for lunch and had a delicious and very filling meal. The prices are quite affordable too especially for the value you get, and the high quality of every roll. The food also came unbelievably quickly. The interior is super small and at times even feels a bit cramped but for a quick and delicious bite, it's nothing that'll keep me away from my sooshee. After a super filling meal, we paid about $20 each for lunch, not too bad at all. The only complaint I have so far is that some of the wait staff can be quite unpleasant and abrupt. Some of the looks I got made me feel unwanted there. But otherwise the food is hard to beat, a great place to order for pick up and have a nice party tray at home that you'll never forget."}
{"text":"Alright we kissed and made up... The mushroom soup is the best of its kind anywhere... Solid sashimi... Maybe I have to just get over the fact when I go there all sweaty after yoga these dudes aren't interested in providing me good service... Is that like yogi discrimination or what... Anyways all good.. Really a toss up between TOMO and MI-NE"}
{"text":"They were used to be my fav sushi place but after the owner/manager changed in 2011 I found that quality & taste is no longer is the same. Still one of the better sushi restaurant in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Excellent, very quick and courteous service, and very good sushi. The wait staff were very quick to respond. Rolls were large and did not include too much rice."}
{"text":"Went here based on Francie F's glowing reviews of this place in both the Richmond Hill and Aurora location. Aurora's a bit too far from me and I'm never there, but was in the Hill to visit some friends.  

I had maki combo lunch I (8 pcs lobster roll and 3 pc California rolls) - about $15 and unagi maki hand roll - $5 , I think.  

Maki combo lunch I - excellent presentation as they deep fried the lobster shell and put it within two rolls, so you know you are eating lobster (lol).  California rolls were average, but really, that's all you can expect from California rolls. 

Unagi hand roll - I absolutely LOVE eel. I used to hate it because we always bought it from T&T and had a very stinky fishy taste to it, but I'm glad this place did it justice.  Eel is an acquired taste, but this hand roll was nicely wrapped, crispy on the outside and easy to eat (I hate it when you get hand rolls and they are hard to eat because the seaweed is too chewy).  

Overall, good place and will try something different next time."}
{"text":"I've only gotten take out (due to a early to bed toddler), so I can't comment on service.

But the rolls and sushi are HUGE!  Almost too big.  But fresh and delicious!  I love the orangeville roll.  I haven't had anything bad yet!  We way over ordered the first time.  But now we know, 1 roll each and a few pieces of sushi is more than enough."}
{"text":"I stopped eating to rate them.
Amazing! Great quality, good portions, warm decor, good service.
It's not the fancy sushi with Instagram models kind of clientele, but it's honest and real.

Well done guys."}
{"text":"Rolls at MiNe are huge, although they used to be bigger than what it is now. Thay being said, the give the quantity and quality. My favourite is the orangeville roll with spicy scallop. The other specialty roll i would go for is the torched one, but other than those two, the others were nothing special in my opinion. 

Their sashimi are served at the right temperature, and their tempura batter has a taste that sometimes remind me of mcds mcnugget batter (which i dont mind at all!). 

I usually go for their set 2 dinner for two, which includes two seaweed salads, lobster and shrimp tempura, orangeville roll, sashimi and another roll (i forgot which one), teriyaki dish, mushroom soup, and dessert. Not bad for a bit over $60. 

Staff has been working there for a while now, but I find their service varies, so a bit inconsistent but overall good. They also have some good lunch/ afternoon tea deals."}
{"text":"Really good sushi here! its definitely been a family favorite sushi place in richmond hill. the staff is really friendly too :)
its a little bit pricer for the speciality rolls but they're delicious--i like the lobster roll and the caterpillar roll..aaaaaand a bunch others 
their tempura is sweet and crispy so anything with that is yummy :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Medium combination platter (mixture of nigiri, maki and sashimi) with 2 friends which came on a Sushi boat. Came up to about $1 a piece

++Acidity of the rice was done correctly
++Fish was decently fresh for the price
+Good amount of variety 
+Food came quickly despite it being a busy night with many take out orders
-If you're expecting superior quality, this is probably not the place for you. Mi-Ne is more of a \"fill-me-up\" sushi restaurant that doesn't sacrifice too much quality for volume like most AYCE
--Gave us too many California rolls - accounted for 12 of the ~80 pieces

Note that the restaurant is ran by Korean folks and not traditional Japanese sushi chefs so you will taste the difference in style."}
{"text":"Well well well, two dozen more visits/orders later and this is literally King of the Hill when it comes to sushi! I must have tried (in vain mind you) probably 10 other decently rated places around RH in search of a slightly cheaper alternative and suffice to say I just decided to stop wasting time and money cause when it comes to quality or portions nowhere comes clise north of Steels St.

Updated rating to 5 star as their moody head waiter seems to have left, replaced by a much friendlier fella."}
{"text":"I've come here on many occasions and the lunch/ dinner specials are to die for. The prices are a little high but the portions more than make up for this. The sushi is fresh and the rice is always perfect temperature and consistency (not hot and too vinegary). Service is fast and I always leave so full!"}
{"text":"Love the sushi and rolls platter! We ordered the large size for 3 people. Huge rolls and it includes complementary miso soup as well. I like it how the server asked us whether we wants wasabi inside the rolls or not. Service was good. A must try restaurant!"}
{"text":"I had a good time at this restaurant. However, I expected a bit more after reading many exciting reviews. The food was tasty, but the service was just average. It's a bit pricy, but I'd say it's worth it. I had the Course D dinner meal for two which came with 2 wakame salads, mushroom soup, 18 pcs sushi and maki, 20 pcs sashimi, and 2 ice creams. Also ordered the Orangeville roll on the side because it's a popular item. The food came out in a boat which was really neat and presentable. It was all delicious and fresh, but my favourite was the Orangeville roll - so yummy!"}
{"text":"Number 1 sushi place in Richmond Hill! The food never disappoints when I come here!
It tends to get very busy on Friday and Saturday nights so I recommend making a reservation unless you want to wait a long time for a table.
I ordered the beef teriyaki combination dinner with shrimp/vegetable tempura, and 6 pieces of cucumber sushi. 
This place is more pricey however, the food quality is fantastic
Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I ordered my order to go on New Year's Eve and www happy that they answered their phones as it can get extremely busy.  The restaurant itself is very small and so we prefer to take out. 

I ordered the spicy roll set which includes a spicy California roll, spicy salmon roll and spicy tuna roll.  We also ordered the sashimi appetizer.  Over the phone I requested that they include the Korean hot sauce but found when I got there that the person who took my order hadn't done so.  It also took the person a while to locate my bag and I finally had to point it out to them.  To add a little bit of insult to injury they actually charged me for the hot sauce so I was not entirely impressed.

When we got home they had included with our order one miso soup and one salad.  The miso soup is always great there not overly salty and not bland.  The salad isn't the usually Japanese style and includes a cheaper tasting version that uses oranges rather than ginger.  The sashimi appetizer was beautifully presented with a wide assortment of fish which al tasted fresh.

The spicy roll set is little bit less than stellar.  The California roll was so so and cut way too big.  They definitely go for quantity over quality.  The spicy salmon roll was oozing some sort of oil.  I personally do not like how they do it at this restaurant.  They mash up the salmon almost like they blend it and so you don't get to actually enjoy the texture of the salmon and he spicy flavours as it's just one big mess.  They could definitely do better with their rolls and this would make it a class A sushi restaurant.  Despite everything it is one of the better sushi places in York region."}
{"text":"came here at night craving sushi and from a recommendation of a friend 
it was pretty quiet that day and the interior decor of this restaurant looked like authentic Japanese restaurants 
we chose to sit in a booth that was enclosed by wood so it looked like a room
for 3 people we got set C that had 8 piece 
dynamite roll and 8 piece spider roll for $25 and included the standard miso soup and salad
and the tempura yam roll that had 6 pieces for around $7 
the service is pretty good and the food came quickly

the yam tempura was very good and had fries at 
the top. it also had a sweet sauce combined with the crunchiness of the yam one of the best sushi's I've had. I love it !!!!! 5/5 

the dynamite roll had raw salmon avocado cucumber and some other toppings. It also tasted really good and came in big pieces. better than the average dynamite roll and I would get it again  4.5/5 

the spider roll had crab. I wasn't too big of a fan for this because it was a little mushy from the crab also I don't really like the crab mixed in sushi and had a little fishy taste but it wasn't bad 3.5/5 

Overall the sushi here is very good and price is average expect to spend around $10-$15. I would come again to try more !!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant. The gyoza udon is very tasty. The first time I came in, I tried ordering a bento box, this was around lunch time. They said it wasn't offered. I'm now seeing people that have posted photos of lunch bento boxes. 
I've ordered one meal that came with rolls. The rolls were well presented, very tasty and quite big in size. 
The service is good however refills on water is only served when asked. Will continue to visit and I do recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent food, clean restaurant, great service!

They all greet you and welcome you as soon as you come in, likewise when you leave they all say goodbye and have a good day!

Lunch specials are great! I've been to this place 2 times, and I've always loved the prompt service and amazing food. Very consistent quality. The chicken teriyaki and beef teriyaki portions of the lunch special are a good large amount, compared to other sushi places I've been to.

I will always be a regular customer during lunch hours as I love their lunch specials, good price and good portions for what you pay.

This place is always busy when I go, but not too packed that I had to wait to be seated.

Over-all very clean restaurant, nice service, and good food. Definitely one of the best places for sushi in the GTA!"}
{"text":"Brother of my fave restaurant, same name but diff location. This one is in Richmond Hill, I was excited to try this place out because I absolutely love the downtown location one near Rogers Centre( or Skydome too :p) it's so healthy, fresh and monster size. It's made right in front of you, you can see the good quality ingredients. The Richmond Hill location lived to the expectation of its sister. The portions were fresh and large, I didn't dine in, got take out. The roll size is quarter sized of my palm. Absolutely huge for sushi size and almost embarrassing to eat in front of a date haha, open wide literally LOL my only complain would be, sushi taste soooooo good, size is too much, you almost get full in seconds :( lol 

The bill was a bit below 50$, we ordered 1 ginger ale, 1 coca cola, 1 set of lobster roll, 1 spider roll, 1 spicy scallop roll and 1 dynamite. The plating, even for take take out was so pretty, I call it sushi art. 

Great place, fast service, delish food! If your in the area, yonge and Elgin mills, check it out."}
{"text":"My favourite place to go for lunch and dinner.

They have a very affordable lunch menu! I usually get the chicken teriyaki & sushi combination combo ($11.95). For dinner, I usually get a Love Boat ($53.95) which is more than enough for two to share; I usually have to pack a bunch to go!

Highly recommend their spicy salmon/tuna rolls, and their fish is so fresh. All of their rolls are super big and filling."}
{"text":"This is our go to Japanese Restaurant, food is always fresh and good.   Especially like the Spider, Green Dragon, and Caterpiller Roll....and sashimi/sushi is always on our order"}
{"text":"I come here quite often, and it is the favourite sushi place of my friends and family. The sushi is delicious."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my parents and my grandparents. We had the hamachi kama yaki ($13.95), the Mi Ne special tempura dinner ($27.95), the torched rainbow dragon roll ($15.95), and some sort of sashimi platter which costed somewhere in the high twenties to mid thirties. It was just enough food for the five of us.

The hamachi kama yaki (yellowtail collar, for those of you who are unfamiliar with the term) was decent in portion and was cooked very well. It was still very juicy. Good stuff. I wish it didn't have the sauce on it though. It masked some of the natural seafood taste of the hamachi. 

The Mi Ne special tempura dinner came with 4 really small lobster tails (think large prawns), assorted seafood (artificial crab, fish, scallops, shrimp), assorted veggies (peppers, onions, broccoli, mushroom skewers, sweet potato, zucchini?), and chicken katsu. It also came with salad and rice. The tempura was fairly well done, but the lobster tails were underwhelming.

The torched rainbow dragon roll was on the pricey side for 7 pieces, but there was a distinct torched flavor, so I'll give that to them. It was a tasty roll, but I can't justify the price.

The size of the sashimi pieces was generous, although not quite so much as last time. The selection was not too bad, although I wish there was hamachi (If I recall correctly, there wasn't any in this platter. Should this prove otherwise, I'll update this review). There was one sweet shrimp, and it was the worst sweet shrimp I've ever had. Thankfully, it wasn't bad, and it didn't give me food poisoning. However, it had no taste. At all. The rest of it was quite tasty though. They also gave us a spoonful of ikura (salmon eggs) on one of our selections of sashimi, and the ikura was delightful.

All in all, a fairly decent meal.

Side note. It can get difficult to put a wheelchair into one of their private rooms."}
{"text":"Has been a goto place for sushi for my family. Their rolls are really good. It is not a big place and it gets busy on weekends but it is not hard to get a table on week nights. We also do a lot of take out."}
{"text":"A couple of days ago I strayed from my favorite sushi restaurant and visited Mi Ne Japanese Restaurant.

I'm on the fence.

The sushi (4 out of 5). Its good :)

The sashimi was beautiful! The portions were very generous. Much larger than most other restaurants (5 out of 5). 

I only became disappointed when I was told I could not exclude the surf clam from my 12 piece assortment. ( 4 out of 5).

Than, when the dish came, 4 of the 12 piece assortment were surf clam....... (3 out of 5)

A 12 piece assortment costs $17.00 so I'm kind of disappointed that they wouldn't accommodate or at least reduce the amount.

Those surf clams haunt my dreams..."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with friends (medium party 6ppl).  I found the sushi to be not bad at all for the location being far up in the suburbs.  The amount of rice was a thin layer which is how it should be with fresh raw fish.  The service however wasn't great as we only saw the waitress once when she took our order.  The price could be a little lowered for sushi these days being a lot less - spent $30+ for two rolls."}
{"text":"Decided to see what is all the hype about. The place was absolutely packed for lunch, and you could easily see why - it doesn't have a lot of seating. 

There are quite a few, very cozy (if a bit dated) booths. 

The food was ok. I can't say it was great, because I was expecting more out of this place. 

The rolls are absolutely huge, so you get a lot of food for your dollars. 

Not sure if I will repeat."}
{"text":"This isn't AYCE but you can bet that the price you pay for the food is worth it. A local favourite that gets packed during dinner time, Mi Ne offers fresh and great-tasting sushi and sashimi. The rolls are pretty big too - even at 8 pieces per roll, portion isn't a problem. My friend and I ordered a jumbo dynamite roll (can't go wrong with this classic!) which was only a dollar more than their regular-sized dynamite roll and had a double portion of shrimp tempura, fresh salmon, avocado, toboko, & cucmber, an orangeville roll (spicy scallop, tobiko, avocado, cucumber, crab meat, & fresh salmon), and 3pcs each of sake sashimi (salmon) and albacore BC tuna sashimi (unfortunately they ran out of tuna belly sashimi so we got this one instead). My fave roll was the dynamite since it had a sweeter sauce to top it off and I usually lean towards sweet things plus the crunch of the shrimp tempura is always so delicious! I'm not the biggest sashimi eater but my friend is and she said that the sashimi they serve is really good and fresh. I'm glad we found this sushi place! While not a cheap option, you won't go wrong with their quality. It's a definite recommend! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yum! Who knew such a gem was in r-hilly?! Apparently a lot of you do, because I am SOOO late on this one. Again, the amazing Kris U introduced this beauty of a sushi joint and I AM IN LURRRVE. 

Service is on point = quick, friendly and ears of a hawk - they had new chopsticks brought over to our table before the original ones barely hit the ground. The menu is huge and there are a lot of veggie options that are actually FILLING. I had the yam + avocado roll on the lunch menu and it was super filling.. it was actually a struggle.. like, survival of the fittest. It wasn't just the yam, but they had this entire heap of yam tempura on top of the yam rolls. Nom. The speciality rolls are larger than life and piled with all sorts of ingredients. The sushi boat looked gorgeous - seriously, I love when sushi is put on boat plates. So cute. It's enough to fill two people, I think. 

I also love sitting inside the little traditional japanese booths. They even have a little curtain that you can pull down to protect yo' privacy. 

This is only 10 minutes away from my house and I just discover it now?! I feel like I've missed out on a lifetime of delicious and fresh sushi."}
{"text":"Disappointed at this place and there's much better spots around. 

Came here with the family for lunch today, got seated in a booth and was asked to move to another smaller table when there were other booths available. Not a big deal overall, but worth a mention. The place is pretty small and the decor and booths are awesome. 

We ordered the love boat - 20  assorted sashimi, 8 nigiri, 20 rolls - which included dynamite, california, and spicy salmon rolls and the orangeville special roll separately. First things first, the sashimi was cut really thick and the quality was just average. I expected it to be more fresh. I'm not a big fan of this, I wish they were smaller since it was too much fish in one bite. The sushi rice was fine and adequate, although it could have been more warm. The selection of sashimi in the loveboat was pretty good. The orangeville roll was really good and was the highlight of the meal. Really well constructed with lots of flavours going on. I kind of wish we strictly ordered special rolls, and I think if I had, I would have had a better experience here. However, they are kind of pricey with the more expensive ones coming in at $15/16 for 8 pieces. The spicy salmon was good, except where's the salmon? Really, it's almost all breadcrumbs. I even took it apart and pretty sure I didn't see any salmon. Dynamite and california rolls were average and nothing special. 

Service could have been a lot better, the waiter did not check on us the entire time and although we didn't ask to refill our tea, it should be offered.

I don't know what happened because there are so many overwhelming positive reviews, but I just didn't find this place that good. Maybe it's just a one-off thing?"}
{"text":"My all time fav Japanese restaurant. Everything is fresh, high quality and delicious. That fact that its always busy demonstrates their commitment to quality. Remember to make reservations as the wait could get quite long given the size of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice place to have good quality Maki sushi, great service, decent privacy and excellent food. The only reason it's 4/5  is that had to wait for desert for half an hour since they got so busy. Check out Mi Ne Sushi in Aurora is great too!"}

Stopped by while we were in the area to give this place a try. We weren't too hungry but in the end we ordered the Mi-Ne dinner for 2.

As soon as the food came I knew I was in trouble... definitely got more food than I had expected. The food came out really fast, I had barely cleared the last dish when the next came out. The sunomono salad was good, very little vinegar in the salad. Honestly not a fan of tempura already so the tempura was just ok. I found the lobster tempura to be interesting, but nothing special. The sushi was good, reasonably fresh and they gave a decent variety. The kalbi was well done. Cooked just right and very flavorful.

They have a bunch of rooms and booths and the look is pretty typical of an older a la carte Japanese restaurant. The plating and presentation of the food is done well.

The service was good and the staff were friendly 

I don't often come up to this area to eat, but the value for the food is good. I would recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"Party of 2, ordered two lunch combos to share ( Mi-Ne Bento box, and the spicy salmon+spicy scallop rolls) and it was wayyy too much food. Everything was fresh and delicious, the rice to fish ration was perfect. IMO, ordering just the bento box would have been enough food, and price wise that would have been perfect as well. Total for the meal was around $40, which was fair for the amount and quality that we were served."}
{"text":"I usually get takeout, but it is nice to go inside and sit down once in a while, it's a very nicely decorated place. My favorite things to get are the shrimp tempura and the beef teriyaki. The sushi rolls are all very good, hardly every a disappointment. Overall a very good place to eat."}
{"text":"Taste wise, pretty standard. This place is certainly pricier than other restaurants, but the portions are massive! At least their rolls are. I am writing this while taking a break. 

Ordered the make set F ($19.95) which consists of 6 each of salmon, California, and tempura shrimp rolls. Their salmon roll is PACKED with salmon and their filling to rice ratio is really spot on (thin layer of rice). Even so, not even half way through and I'm full. Easily shareable between two average eaters. 

Food came out in less than 10 minutes despite the place being pretty busy and their hefty orders of sushi boats. 

Overall, 
Taste  7/10
Value  8.75/10
Service  8/10"}
{"text":"The fish is really fresh and tasty.  Many unique rolls to choose from.  Tempura Lobster tails could be a bit more flavorful and that is the only reason my rating is not a 5."}
{"text":"3.5***

Made reservations in advance and they clearly told me that I can only be there for 1.5 hours max...which was kinda a turn off..

Sashimi was quite fresh yet the Uni slightly did disappoint me considering that the price was 8.95$ for 2 pieces.. hmm....

We ordered the sushi platter excluded tuna sashimi as we were all not tuna fans..presentation was good and price point was acceptable...

service was a little bit slow to be honest maybe due to the fact it was a Friday evening...all in all, a place that I will come back when I'm in the area..It's kinda out of the way to come here for me.."}
{"text":"Ok so we were trying to make the Aurora location for the lunch special but it wasn't to be so we tried  this location and were a bit surprised to find out they have different menus and also don't have the 10% off when paying with cash. The differences didn't end there it wasn't horrible but not worth my hard earned cash the staff seemed nice but nothing above and beyond and if you ask me when we the people go out and eat it should be worth it.
Just to be clear the fish was clean and fresh tasting but compared to the Aurora location well below par in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best sushi restaurant in York Region. The fish is always fresh and they serve real rolls which are large and tasty. Spicy salmon and Tuna Lovers rolls are my favourite items. One special roll and a maki is more than enough to satisfy an adult man. The yaki udon is also very tasty and recommended. They also have some Korean good as well as the place is run by Koreans. But the sushi, again I cannot stress enough, is amazing. The sashimi is also very fresh and served in thick slices. None of the sick inducing aftertaste that comes from all you can eat sushi.

They also have locations in Aurora and downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"The sushi was delicious! Extremely fresh and ...big! Mushroom soup was good, and so was beef teriyaki. The portions are huge, so we couldn't finish everything. 
Good luck getting a table without a reservation, as this location is pretty busy. The service was pretty chaotic, but I can't blame them because as I said they get pretty busy. The food came out fast, though. 
Probably not a good spot if you want to sit down and relax or for a romantic dinner, but if you want good sushi for cheap -that's the place to go!"}
{"text":"We wanted some sushi in Toronto so after reading the rave reviews here on Yelp, we decided to check out what Mi-NE was all about. We come in on a Friday night and it was packed. I suppose that's a good sign... probably had to wait 15 min or so, not too bad. Once we sat down, we ordered the age dashi tofu for appetizer. When the appetizer came, the dried shaved bonito on top was still moving! (Or the heat or a/c was blowing hard in here). Anyways, I can tell you that this was one of the better age dashi tofu I've ever had and I've had some pretty crappy ones. For sushi, we ordered a whole boatload of raw fish, quite literally! I forgot how many pieces we had ordered but it was more than enough. I was quite full at the end. The sushi was really good here too. Fish seems fresh. Pieces nicely cut. The makis tasted good. Mmm nom nom nom! We had ordered so many pieces that I'm not even going to try to break down what we ordered individually mainly because 1.) I had forgotten what we had ordered and 2.) there's just too much to list; I'd still be here tomorrow writing this if I were to list everything out. All you need to know is this place does live up to its rave reviews and awards it had gotten and for sushi, it is reasonably priced as well.

Sidenote: we did take much longer than expected to get here though, because we took the \"scenic route.\" By the time we got here, everybody in the car was ready to gnaw each other's limbs off and more. Luckily, it wasn't too long of a wait inside. I guess that's what we get for being tourists hah. On the other hand though, I did get to see a lot more of Toronto than I would have ever imagined. Now I know that there is a \"Korea Town\" there--or at least a Korean section of Yonge Street."}
{"text":"Food portion was good but service was bad.  Food was slow to come and rice was not cooked properly for the sushi.  This made the sushi tasted not as good it's supposed to. Waitress didn't to bother to ask us if we wanted more tea or if we wanted anything else.  Instead she just brought us the bill and expected us to leave. How rude?!"}
{"text":"Speed Read:
1) Lobster Roll - like, big portion
2) Sushi boat - OK
3) Not AYCE
4) Price: A la Carte sushi price

Please tell me if you like or hate my review.

I went with a couple friends for dinner.
I noticed the lunch menu offer better deals than dinner.

We order 2 rolls and a sushi boat.
Similar to other review, we like the rolls.
The lobster roll is huge with lots flavor and ingredient, with real lobster meat.
Maybe it's my taste preference, but I found the roll to have too much sauce and the sauce overpowered the roll ingredient taste.
Go light on the sauce and let the ingredient shine!!

The sushi tray/boat is so so.  I kind of expect better salmon than what I get at AYCE.

Customer service is great.

I like the layout of the restaurant.  The layout provides a lot of quiet and private tables or booths to have a good conversation."}
{"text":"Mine sushi is great, it is by far the best sushi place in Richmond hill.
The bento boxes are great, their handrolls are amazing specially the spicy tuna handroll which I order every time I am there, and their sashimi is fresh and tastes great.
Price wise they are reasonable not really cheap and not really expensive either right in the middle."}
{"text":"Decent sushi at an affordable price especially their lunch menu. The server can get very busy and took a bit longer to requests for certain things. But not a big deal as long as the sushi is good. Been here many times and the taste never fails."}
{"text":"Mi-NE Sushi

This place was pretty awesome! Everything's fresh, and you can tell because it takes them about 10-20 minutes to prepare your food. You have to call in and reserve a place. It's a nice cozy little place, and if you'd like privacy, there's a little curtain which you can hang from the entrance. Really isn't comfortable for more then 5-10 people, but great for small get-togethers! Not too expensive, and has reasonable prices! Over all, i highly recommend this restaurant. Staff are very friendly, and have great English, which is a must! If you decided to come here, you will have come to the right place :) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been here again, however, unfortunately it was a not so great experience. 

I don't know what happened this time but the service and food was not so great. I had a pretty bad stomach flu the week after, and I felt the sushi boat we ordered could've been made better as it looked a little sloppy and unclean. 

As for the service, although the place was full when we arrived, I felt it was hard to get their attention. My friend and I were totally okay with sitting at the bar, since we did not want to wait for a table however, I felt we were ignored as they were too busy seating the larger parties who  came later."}
{"text":"Finally had the \"courage\"  to try a non AYCE place and wasn't disappointed. 

I say courage because usually you get to a point where you are spending more than if you had went to an AYCE. Usually you get the safety net of being able to try a lot of different things with AYCE Vs a la  carte which has this \"finality\" for each decision you make. 

This place tries to emulate those Japanese a la carte places I used to go to downtown. Lots of traditional looking design and table space including semi private dining booths. I believe this is a Korean place based on the language I hear being spoken but I could be wrong but that doesn't affect the quality of the food at all. 

Very high quality cuts of sashimi and maki. Reminds me of a place I used to go to alot when I was in school south of Bloor street near Charles. Tasty lunch specials made with care."}
{"text":"Delicious! The rolls, the noodles, the salad, the soup !
The atmosphere isn't the coolest, and the service sometimes is slow but it's the best sushi on the planet.
Start with mushroom soup, and house salad.
Then go for the Kamikaze roll!
Don't forget the green tea

However, I would have to say that MI NE AURORA is the superior location."}
{"text":"The restaurant is quite small so you may have to wait a bit to get a seat depending on the time you go, but the two times we went (which was late) we had no problems getting a seat. 

The servers were very friendly and accommodating by helping us choose items from their menu. From the two times we've been to this restaurant, we've tried their Love Boat (sashimi, nigiri sushi and rolls), Ocean Smoke Roll, Golden Dragon Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Kalbi appetizer and spicy chicken dinner.

All the sushi rolls were huge and packed with deliciousness!! I highly recommend their Ocean Smoke Roll because it's one of their most popular items and definitely was our favourite roll! 

The Love Boat, which is for 2 people, was perfect because it had a variety of different kinds nigiri and sashimi which was more than enough. Also included were California, spicy salmon, and dynamite rolls. For the price of $53, it was well worth it because we were stuffed!

The kalbi appetizer was very tasty but there was hardly any meat on it and mostly bone. If they're going to serve the kalbi like that, they should at least give more pieces because it was definitely a rip off.

The spicy chicken dinner definitely had some heat and was pretty good. I probably wouldn't order it again because I would rather eat their rolls and sushi.

Overall, I would say this restaurant is by far my favourite place for sushi rolls! Even though this restaurant may be far for some people, I highly recommend people to check it out because you won't be disappointed (maybe just their kalbi)."}
{"text":"So disappointed in the service and taste. Had dinner here with a friend and we ordered an appetizer, 2 rolls and some sashimi / sushi. The waitress didn't bother to tell us that maybe the amount of food would be too much for us because their portions are HUGE (now I see from others on here that the roles are huge), nor did she tell us that the 2 rolls we ordered were practically the same (one didn't have a description in the menu and is typically made in another manner).  We had to ask for drink refills so many times before it happened and asked for the bill 3 times. 

We paid way too much for dinner and the food wasn't very fresh - not sure what everyone is ranting about on here about good taste. Definitely not a 4-star place."}
{"text":"Just wanted to start off by saying this place is simply amazing!! The sashimi dinner is second to none and the rolls are gargantuan and artfully crafted. The private booths are a nice touch! The saki is served warm and is of high standard!! It is my favorite sushi restaurant in North America that I have been to. I have been to many over the years!! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had weekday lunch with my friend. We both ordered lunch special \"spicy tuna & spicy salmon rolls\" and \" teriyaki chicken & tempura shrimp rolls\"

They come with soup and salads. 
Dishes are in big portion and we ended up getting a container to take home. 

Not enough parking in the plaza tho."}
{"text":"It is really 3.5 stars.

I visited as per the many positive Yelp reviews.  We ordered a Small Sashimi Dinner ($28) and a Lobster Roll ($17) to share.  The sashimi was fresh, big, tasty.  In other words, it was excellent and worthy of the pretty pennies.  The accompanying salad and miso soup were average.  The Lobster Roll was underwhelming.  I saw the lobster shell in 2 maki pieces, but when eating the other pieces, I could not taste the lobster.  My BF had to locate the lobster meat in the maki and showed it to me.  In other words, if I didn't know the maki had lobster meat, I really wouldn't figure it out by taste.  I am familiar with the taste of lobster meat, so something has gone amiss with the lobster meat."}
{"text":"By far the most delicious, fresh sushi and sashimi I have tasted in GTA. Not only that, the pieces are huge , barely fit my mouth. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"SNEAKY SERVICE

Me and my s/o started going here frequently last year or so. We would go just the two of us, and we spent a lot so they started to remember us quickly. The sushi was good, expensive but we did like it. 

THE BAD
After Christmas, I had a visa gift card given to me as a gift. I paid for the meal with it, (you just swipe it) the server noticed the card, (he knew us) he then asked me \"How do you know the balance of this card?\" I said I figure it out. My partner looked at me, I could tell from his eyes he thought what he said was odd. We ate at lunch time, that week I grabbed my receipt and I check my card balance online, I saw my bill for there was time stamped FOR MORE MONEY than our bill and now timestamped at 11:30 at night. I tip very well too, for them to sneakily add/steal another $20 is disgusting. 

Of course now we will NEVER go there again."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5
Service: 2/5
Location: 3/5
Decent sushi at a great price in the Richmond Hill area, but it wouldn't be my first choice. The first thing I noticed when we walked in was how cute the décor was. The booths situated on the perimeter of the restaurant were separated by wood panels into tiny private rooms in a Japanese style. They had curtains that, once lowered, divided you from the rest of the restaurant and gave you much more privacy. I liked the idea of it, but it made it very difficult to catch the attention of the servers. Even when we first walked into the tiny restaurant, it took so long for a server to even acknowledge us, let alone seat us (NO CURTAINS INVOLVED)! 

As for the food, I had the Sushi lunch special $12 for 7 pieces nigiri sushi and 6 pieces spicy California roll. The fish is relatively fresh and size-wise the sushi is larger than usual so it feels like a great deal, but the taste itself is nothing special."}
{"text":"Im not sure why this place gets better reviews than Hibiki or even Gals because they are far superior. The sashimi here has no taste and is akin to eating flavourless jelly. Fish quality is sub par. Their saving grace is the rolls - which are numerous in selection and well sauced. The portion sizes are also good. If you are looking for anything other than chefs-special rolls, I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The place is alot smaller than I thought. The place was full when we arrived but were were seated within 5 minutes. I thought the service would be slow because I only saw the one waitress serving the whole restaurant but everything suprisingly came pretty fast. 

I got the Mi Ne lunch bento box special $18.95 - it was the largest lunch bento they had and so I ordered it because I knew the other ones would not fill me to satisfaction. This one was just right for me. I went with salmon teriyaki. I found the portion on the salmon teriyaki on the small side but the bento box also came with sashimi, sushi, glass noodle, veggies, shrimp and veggie tempura. Everything tasted great. The meal also came with the standard salad and miso soup. 

My mom got the beef teriyaki bento box $11.95 - beef was nice and tender and portion of beef was decent. It also came with rice, salad, glass noodle, veggies, shrimp and veggie tempura.

My dad got the salmon teriyaki $8.95 - came with rice, salad, glass noodle, veggies and tofu. Great value for less than $9.

My sister got a sushi plate $12.95 - came with shrimp tempura sushi and a variety of sushi.

All the sushi and sashimi tasted fresh. I thought service was excellent and the lone waitress did an excellent job. Price is competitive with other Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"Went here when Tomo (down the street) was closed for reno's....

Food came really fast.... space was over-crowded and the servers were rude.  I am not sure if they had a really 'off' day when we were there as I am not sure how they have received high ratings....

The rice in the sushi was HOT.  If I think of it now, over a month later, its gag-inducing to me.  Blech.  Sushi rice should not be HOT.  It made the whole roll taste unappetizing.  It seriously put me off sushi for awhile.

My husband had a soup and it was so salty he drank what seemed like ten litres of water over the course of the remaining day.

Avoid.  Unless you like hot sushi rice and salt water soups coupled with rude servers."}
{"text":"If I could I would give this place a 3.5 stars out of 5 but unfortunate yelp doesn't offer half stars. Anyway, dined here with a friend on a Saturday afternoon. Surprisingly it was not very busy, maybe two other tables were occupied. It was also freezing the restaurant which wasn't very pleasant.

The food was pretty good in terms of quality, price and overall taste. I have no complaints with the food but wish our server had been more attentive. 

Would I come back? Maybe if I'm in the area, the price is a bit high for my liking."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! High quality, good tasting fish, reasonable service. Tried a lot of things here. My personal fav- Boston roll and beef short ribs."}
{"text":"This Japanese restaurant is a bit higher in quality than some of the other Japanese non-AYCE restaurants out there. They make large rolls, and their spicy salmon rolls are excellent! Their rolls are not covered with too much rice. The prices are a bit more than the average sushi restaurant and they do not offer AYCE. However, they have many set meals/dinners that will definitely fill you up! It's not a large restaurant, so be sure to make reservations on a weekend as it can become quite busy."}
{"text":"Food quality: 3/5  (quality is good, the taste and the sauce is 3/5)
Service: 4/5

The rolls here are fairly large. There specialty rolls are very good, my go tos are orangeville and catepillar roll. I also have gotten the sushi nigri set and the quality of the fish was ok and the taste was only ok as well. I'd recommend trying something out of their signature rolls if it's your first time there and not sure what to try. Their spicy salmon roll had oddly too much may in it and wasn't that good. This place used to be better with the old owner, the quality has gone down since the switch. Overall it's not bad but not good either. However, there's not many good places around that area, so this is really your only option."}
{"text":"I have to edit my 5 star review below. We went there on Sat and all three of us got food poisoning... :-(
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This place is AMAZING! I love their food and it is totally worth the drive from Thornhill. Our favorite there is Unagi Lovers Dinner - it is so good that we had it last three times we visited :-) 
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"At the top of the Richmond Hill mountain you will find Mi-NE, and all the sushi and sashimi treasures it holds! I'm all about the food, so they get 4 stars for the level of yumminess. I was just here with the hub on the weekend, but we have been here many times before, and the food never disappoints. We have tried many signature maki rolls, and a large variety of sashimi including toro and uni, and it's always nice and fresh (we were scolded once by the waiter for not eating our uni fast enough!!).

Ok so why the 4 stars? If I was to consider things like the size of the establishment, or the waiting for service, or having to request more tea, or having our names on sticky notes outside the booth stating how long until we get booted for the next seating, well then maybe they would get 3 stars overall. However, the food is the law, and their black sesame ice-cream is just the cherry on top of the mountain!"}
{"text":"best sushi in gta...not just richmond hill.
go for kalbi, spicy roll, red dragon roll"}
{"text":"There are few Japanese sushi restaurants in the GTA that compare to the quality I've experienced here. Whether it be their mouth watering crunchy noodle soup or their signature Orangeville roll, you're guaranteed to experience top notch flavors. I've often described the experience here as a culinary symphony in your mouth thanks to the chefs that work here. No where else I've ventured has had chefs this dedicated and technical in their approach to sushi. This must be the reason why the chefs are front and center here and it shows."}
{"text":"Food is decent, but for the price there is better value around. Clean and bright."}
{"text":"Mi Ne is a popular sushi destination in Richmond Hill, and deservedly so. I came in on Valentines with no reservation and ended up waiting for about 35 minutes to get a table. 

A key part of sushi experience is the presentation of the food. Mi Ne's presentation is off-the-charts awesome. 

The menu is on the pricey side and they don't give you any \"on-the-house\" freebies like soups or deserts. Anything you want to eat, you have to pay for. 

The menu has no pictures at all. All black and white, in accordance with the high-end restaurant image they strive so hard to maintain. 

If you don't know how big their maki rolls are (and they are big) you may have a bit of a sticker shock at first. We ordered three roll for the two us and that was enough food to fill us up and then some. 

There is another Mi Me in Aurora featuring the same menu. For some reason, and I can't quite put my finger on it, I like the Aurora version of the food better. For some reason, the Richmond Hill food tasted a bit off a couple of times we've come here. Maybe it's the sauce, who knows. Even their veggie rolls have an odd smokey-fishy finish to them. Maybe their chef likes it that way (I don't). For some reason, both times we've been a bit underwhelmed here.

All in all, a safe place to bring your friends to and look like you know a thing or two about picking a good sushi place."}
{"text":"Mine sushi is honestly some of the best sushi I've ever had. The quality of the fish is amazing and although it's a bit pricey, you're absolutely getting what you pay for. The salmon sashimi melts in your mouth. I am also certifiably addicted to their mushroom soup."}
{"text":"Ughhhhh just so good! The rolls were decently sized. At one point I was concerned that my mouth wouldn't shut while chewing (thank goodness I was a loner in my car). Sushi Chef in Beeton is temporarily closed due a fire - so happy I found this place in lieu.

I've settled my sushi fix by coming here!

Can I also just say that I adored that the chefs all sang hello to me as I walked in? Nice touch!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here last night for dinner. It was before 6pm on a Monday night and the place was mostly empty. We tried the lobster roll ($18) and orangeville roll ($16) based on yelp reviews. They are good size rolls. That orangeville roll was top notch though they could ease up a bit on the sauce. My last piece was a bit salty. Presentation and quality were excellent. The lobster roll was good. I as surprised that no miso soup was provided while we were waiting for our rolls. I don't think I have ever been to a Japanese restaurant where soup was not provided regardless of what you order.  Going to come here for lunch next time to try some other stuff."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi and sashimi with skilled chefs in a casual environment. The food is great and the service is polite but not always attentive, as it's a busy place and the wait staff get spread thin."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Toronto and The GTA - hands down. The amount of fresh fish in the rolls is hands down fresh and plentiful. Super impressed. Love this place as a regular stop."}
{"text":"My go to sushi place in Richmond Hill! Service is friendly, rolls are delicious and great quality. Not as much rice, more seafood and other ingredients. Everything I have ordered I have loved (except for the crab salad). Will be there again soon."}
{"text":"Always such quality yummy sushi!! This hidden gem is amongst all the car dealerships, make sure not to miss it! Hands down the best spicy crispy salmon I've ever had! I love how the rolls are large and the seaweed is on the outside! This place isn't overly expensive but it's not something I can afford weekly.  You can't go wrong with anything off the menu- the fish is fresh and they're generous with the thickness of their sashimi! I've been here on several Occasions and it's always been 10/10!"}
{"text":"I definitely wouldn't not go there. It's just that there are better places in Toronto/Richmond Hill.

It's one of the better sushi places in Richmond Hill for sure and the atmosphere and the quality are authentic and consistent. 

The food is OK. Not fantastic that I have to go there on a daily basis.  

I usually end up getting the Yam Roll, Vegetable Tempura and California rolls. Sometimes the Vegetable Udon Soup (which is impressive to see them bring out)

In a pinch it is a good place to go but not fantastic. 

I also enjoy the orange dessert that comes at the end of each meal. It is a nice touch."}
{"text":"wow. i didn't think this place was this awesome until i got here. The fish is so fresh, they didn't overkill it with rice and if you get a little bento box they have really yummy noodles in there! 

I tried the dragon roll it was delicious and the salmon teriyaki lunch box. A good portion of fish and a wonderful experience! 

definitely coming back to try more delicious sushi!"}
{"text":"This place continually impresses me.  It's a bit pricey, but boy do they give you a lot of food.  Every time we order takeout, I'm surprised at how much stuff they give you and we are always full afterwards.

On top of that, the service is great, food is fresh and delicious and the menu is very creative."}
{"text":"The best sushi restaurant in Richmond Hill hands down. Been going here for years and have not found a better sushi spot. Fish is always fresh and order prepared to order. 

One of our favourites is the miso soup. They will even do a spicy version which is delicious. We also love the Enoki Mushroom Yaki. It comes on a sizzling plate on a bed of onions and peppers. We get this for take out too but it is best eating in restaurant. My favourite roll is the caterpillar roll, although it is quite substantial. Another favourite is the shrimp tempura hand roll. 

The service is always excellent and it is frequently busy. We also tend to order by phone and pick up. Orders are always accurate and ready in a reasonable amount of time.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The best (non-AYCE) sushi spot that I've been to in the GTA. I've been dining here and getting take out for years and am never disappointed. I don't just crave sushi, I crave sushi from Mi Ni. I love my salmon maki and tuna maki rolls. They are always very generously filled with the freshest fish. This place is worth the higher price."}
{"text":"The sushi here is always consistent and delivers on taste and quality. There's nothing different or particularly interesting about this Japanese restaurant, but they do all the classics pretty well. The fish is always fresh and flavourful, and the décor is very traditional. They run lunch combos that offer some superb value as well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to this place pretty much on a weekly basis. The food is delicious and the service is great. We always end up getting the sashimi appetizer, Orangeville roll (a must-try!!) and a different roll, as well as the teriyaki set (chicken and beef). My sister usually orders the seafood teriyaki set and she absolutely loves it. Pretty much everything that I've tasted on their menu has been made to perfection, so I don't think you can go wrong with any choice.

This place is very small, so it's much better to get a reservation, as this place gets very busy. If you really want a booth, then you most definitely need a reservation. I celebrated my birthday here last month and they were able to accommodate 10 people, though the space was very tight. 

Their service is very good. They always have someone come and check to see if you're doing okay. At times we've had difficulty flagging someone down, but that is due to how busy they are most of the time. 

I will most definitely keep coming back, as I crave their food all the time!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Richmond Hill by far. Portions are big and sushi is always fresh."}
{"text":"Commonly referred to as the best sushi place in the area and I agree. The attention to detail is really here and the ingredients are as fresh as they come. I've tried a few different items and I've always been impressed with the quality of the rolls and sashimi, even their avocado is somehow more delicious than other places. The rolls are large but never heavy on rice or seaweed. Service is always prompt, it's never particularly memorable but maybe because the food is so good it distracts from the service. The restaurant itself is really cute and clean, it has a very Japanese feeling to it. The price is generally above average but it's worth it. The lunch specials are fantastic value and I really recommend them if you're not looking to break the bank."}
{"text":"Good quality dine-in or take out.  A couple of years ago they wanted to charge me for an extra tempura sauce.  Boycotted for two years and then decided to come back."}
{"text":"I've been here three times in the past month or so and I'm very happy to have discovered this place.  I am totally over AYCE sushi places.  The food is worth the price you pay.  I'm hooked on the spicy salmon roll.  They stuff all the rolls with more filling and less rice.  The location is clean and the service is efficient.  Parking is a bit of a pain but I'll survive."}
{"text":"This location is just ok, maybe I was unlucky and had a bad chef, cuz I had the sd-16 Spicy roll Set and the spicy Salmon and tuna roll were pretty bad. I unrolled the 4 pieces I had left to look for the bits of sashimi mixed in with the crispy rice and mayo to be disappointed that it looked like one normal sashimi piece was chopped up so so tiny and rolled into that entire roll!
Very disappointed for those 2 rolls, Cali roll is good though.

I feel like this place used to be good but it's decreased it's value and quality.
Also I talked to 2 servers at Tomo sushi who both used to work here and he said the owners were very rude to staff =("}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi restaurant, and i have been going here for 18 years and was always given nothing short of the best sushi in this city. For the past month their quality has really dramatically began to deteriorate. My aunt got extreme food poisoning when she went in a couple of weeks ago and my mom and I left with intense stomach aches from the bad quality of fish that they have started using. The fish from the Orangeville roll was very smelly and bad quality. I am very disappointed in their recent quality decline."}
{"text":"Still great but not that great for groups larger than 10. They had this awesome huge boat though which is sure to impress. Great presentation.

Good break from all those ayce places"}
{"text":"Mi Ne is the perfect name for this place, it's small. Make sure you call ahead and try to make reservations. 

The wait for a table wasn't terrible for us, but if we got here any later, it could have been 30+ minutes. Keep In mind this was a Monday night, not a weekend. That should speak highly about the place. 

The food was delivered in a respectable amount of time and the staff were all friendly.   I wouldn't say they were the friendliest but enough to make this a pleasant experience. 

We each started with a soup. I had the spicy Miso soup, a nice change from your tilt all miso found at all Japanese restaurants.  It was spicy enough to tickle my throat it not overly hot that I wasn't able to enjoy it.  

My wife had the gyoza soup (wonton soup). This would have been perfect if not served boiling hot. We love hot soup but this was a bit too hot to enjoy until it cooled down.  Needless to say, it tasted delicious!  Definitely recommended both of these soups. 


We then shared a few rolls.  Presentation was nice and they added a nice side of yam tempura fries as a bonus. The rolls were good and fresh.  Not the greatest but better than average. 

I'd go back on a Monday when my regular sushi place is closed."}
{"text":"VERY busy around dinner time, and for good reason (had to wait about 20 minutes for a table for two).  It was probably the best sushi i've had uptown.  Everything was super fresh and very nicely prepared/presented. They dont have very many large tables so you might want to call ahead if you're going with a group larger than 4 or 6.

Got the course dinner for 2 (around $55 or so) that included so much food we had trouble finishing (miso soup/salad, couple maki's, a variety of sushi, a chicken teriyaki entree, and icecream for dessert).

Also a really cool/nice setup with the samurai figure in the entranceway."}
{"text":"I used to really love this place and frequented it often but I have recently grown disenchanted.  While the food is fresh and good, I am consistently disappointed by the service.  Perhaps it is a cultural divide but I find the servers to be unfriendly if not out right rude."}
{"text":"The food is so good, try to make a reservation or arrive early, we waited 20 min but I don't regret since the meals were amazing."}
{"text":"I used to love this place a lot. In fact, it used to be my favourite place in Richmond Hill...until my last visit. Their food is still really good, but they've increased prices quite a bit over the past 3-4 years, making it a not so obvious value proposition to go there. They have a good variety of rolls, sushi and sashimi, along with other main dishes. These guy definitely deserve 4 stars, but I won't be going back there. I'd much rather prefer Ichiban Fish House at 9425 Leslie St. They offer better value for your money IMHO."}
{"text":"I've been to this sushi joint quiet a few times... there is a reason. Coming by a decent sushi joint in Richmond Hill honestly isn't bad but if I had to choose what lies in the top 5 percent; Mi Ne does hold a spot. So why 4 stars?? Simply due to the space. Considering Richmond Hill is a suburban area and not so crowded; you'd think when you step into this place; your in core downtown due to lack of space and seating. Saying that; does not mean slow service. Also the ambiance isn't really set due to the cramping of space; surprisingly this spot does attract couples...simply for the food i'd presume. But in terms of quality and your bang for your buck; this place is so worth it. The quality of fish and sushi is hands down great and VERY filling. Its hard to find sushi places that don't load up on rice rather than filling and this place satisfies me 100 percent. The rolls here are hands down some of the best rolls I've had... If you've been eyeing this place.. trust me its worth the wait time.. and yes you will probably have to wait.. no one gets a table just walking in unless lunch time is 4pm for you. Either way definitely a spot on place to have sushi. Do not rolls are HUGE so order cautiously... unlike other places; 1 roll can and will fill you up :)"}
{"text":"Their sushi is great they have great rice to fish ratio and its fresh.

My issue with them is that they don't give complimentary miso soup for any platter orders which is strange. You're in there spending $100-150 on a platter and then for a $20 Chirashi order they'll give you miso soup and an abundance of soy sauce if you're doing take out at no extra cost? I've also had an issue once when the platter order had an overwhelming amount of salmon sashimi more than a variety (Lack of consistency)."}
{"text":"While I adore Mi Ne and swear by their orangeville roll, I have no choice but to deduct 2 stars for really poor service. Arrived at 6:30p on a Friday night with reservations and we were guided to our table. After that, our waitress must have vanished into thin air. We sat for almost 30 minutes with nothing but the menu. Not even a glass of water. Eventually another server who just happened to be walking by asked if someone was helping us. I understand the dreaded friday evening rush of diners but Mi Ne is only so big! I can't possibly understand how servers in such a small establishment can get so overwhelmed to the point that a table is ignored for 30 minutes. To be completely honest, if not because I knew I wouldn't be disappointed by the food, I would've walked out. While this is not a deal breaker because like I said, the orangeville roll is out of this world, ill probably stick to takeout or resort to visiting during off-peak hours."}
{"text":"Always come here for the Alaska roll and their tempura upon is great!  Kanisu salad and spicy salmon roll is delish too!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places I've been to in the area! The prices are reasonable and the sashimi is very fresh. We ordered the love boat, which had the perfect combination of sashimi, nigiri and rolls. The sashimi was cut super thick and was very high quality. The spicy salmon maki is the best I've ever eaten and deserves a special shoutout. They stuff it with a generous amount of spicy salmon - there was definitely more salmon than rice. The menu says that the boat is for 2 people but I feel that it's more than enough for 2 people. We were a party of 3 and ordered an additional torched rainbow roll, but I was stuffed by the end of the meal. 

The torched rainbow roll is something that I haven't found in too many restaurants. I'm a huge fan of seared sashimi but the roll is covered in teriyaki and spicy mayo, which made it very flavorful but hard to taste the seared sashimi. 

They have better service than most sushi places, it's really easy to flag down a waiter. All in all a great place, and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite uptown sushi restaurant! The sashimi is always fresh. The chirashi dinner is my fav! Portions are very generous."}
{"text":"Back here Mi-Ne Japanese for dinner and really enjoyed my

Chirashi ($17.95) has such good selections of fish: BC Tuna, Tuna, Salmon, Salmon Roe, Tobiko....

All nicely presented and artfully waiting for me to enjoy!

One of the best Chirashi in the area at this price point!! 

Now I know where to fulfill my sashimi craving! Mi-Ne is the one!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with this restaurant. The service was very poor. And the food was not great. The chicken katsu was very oily and served in a bed of raw cabbage. The seafood udon noodles had only 3 shrimps and only a bite of lobster. Totally not worth the money."}
{"text":"Mine is a nice authentic Japanese restaurant owned by Koreans. They have some nice cozy booths with curtains for privacy. Their menus has a huge selection and there is honestly too many combos and choices to choose from. They have a lot of special rolls and I recommend you try at least one. The prices are a little on the high end.. So be prepared to spend $$$ to be full! The service was fast and waiters are responsive. 

We ordered sashimi and sushi combination for 25.99 and another sashimi appetizer for 13.99. The mushroom soup with gyoza is also really good! This restaurant doesn't give out free salad or miso like other Japanese restaurants. It was super flavourful and had a lot of mushrooms in it. The sashimi was fresh but I would say it's pretty on par with other restaurants, it doesn't strike me as anything special. The sashimi dishes we got consisted of the usual fish, salmon, butterfish, hamachi, yellowtail and tuna. The other dish we got was the tornado roll which has cream cheese and overpowered everything, I'm not into it but I think some might feel the combination is perfect lol."}
{"text":"With all the Japanese restaurants around the GTA, this is probably one of those that makes me feel right in a small village in Japan because of the interior.  And my kids were fascinated with the Samurai armour that greeted us at the door.

For the menu price we were hoping to be quite impressed or surprised with something out of the ordinary.  But we had some setback with the quality, consistency, and wait time.  In spite of these, there is so much to like here and some cute finer details in food presentation.  

The Lobster Roll and Spider Roll are good and the Sashimi at par.  The Shrimp Tempura is brought in like a delicious sierra of pretzel treats.  The variety of Sashimi in the boat that we ordered that included a nice serving of salmon roe, white tuna that's slightly grilled or charred at the top yet fresh and succulent in the center; the soft white strips of squid, is also noteworthy. 

Although I noticed some fishiness with the salmon sashimi  (good seafood should taste like seafood and not fish or scale), the rest were well made, slices and portions were generous.  But with that price we could have had a better dining experience in another Japanese restaurant.

Its probably worth a second visit.  ;)"}
{"text":"Closest sushi restaurant that is delicious. Expensive but very tasty.  I liked the fact that the rice is done perfectly al dente and the sashimi are thick cuts, roughly 1 cm per slice.  I hate sushi places that cram your sushi with rice and give you a paper thin fish.

Chirashi is my favorite, basically sashimi on a bowl of rice.  I love that they sear the outside of the white tuna while keeping the inside still raw giving it a duo texture and adding a layer of flavor to it.

Rolls are delicious and the plating is well done.

Place is small and Friday nights are brutal.  Orders can take a very long time and by the numerous reviews on the side, one can tell how popular it is.  So make your reservations or order take out like I do."}
{"text":"Great service. Fresh food. I'm a Wednesday patron every week. Much recommended for all sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Left a BAD taste in my mouth!!!! 

So I arrived with my party at 9:20pm Sunday night and was immediately told after sitting down that the restaurant closed at 10pm sharp.  We ordered our drinks and food within 5 minutes and waited till 9:45 for our food to arrive.  We only had our boat of sushi for approximately 5 minutes before the waiter came with the bill and asked us to pay so they could of closed the cash.  I have frequently this restaurant a few times and personally if they were trying to close up, they could of just said the kitchen was closed and not sat us at all.  I would of appreciated that a lot more than being rushed out the door.  I did not enjoy the experience at all and would have to think hard about attending this restaurant again and recommending it as the best sushi restaurant in Richmond Hill.

Not a good experience"}
{"text":"I. Love. This. Place.

I live about a 5 minute drive away from Mi Ne so I've been here a lot, and as someone who has eaten a lot of sushi, I can tell you, it's still my favourite. The fish is super fresh and the sushi is on point. I'm not someone who can tell always tell a difference in the quality of sushi, but I can tell you when there's a big discrepancy between amazing and mediocre. This place is amazing. 

I try to order different menu items each time, but if it's your first time coming and you're with a group of 2-3 people, I definitely recommend getting one of the boats. They're huge and have a fantastic variety (also very, very instagrammable). Although each boat is approx. $60, it's well worth it if you split the price. If you're coming for lunch, I highly recommend CL-2, an amazing combo with a tempura bento box (super cute small dishes!), 3 pieces of california roll, and 3 pieces of nigiri sushi. Best part is, you get a HUGE meal under $20. 

Mi Ne also has an amazing atmosphere. Although it's small (don't worry, I've never had to wait for seats and I've been here probably a million times), it's very quiet and offers these adorable little Japanese style booths which have curtains you can pull down. Whether you're with friends, family, or on a date, it allows you to set the mood. It's perfect for conversation!

Service is great - very attentive and careful. I have no complaints there.

Make sure you visit Mi Ne if you're looking for some quality sushi in Richmond Hill!"}
{"text":"Wow just wow! Didnt plan to review this place since it already has so many reviews but I just had to after eating here tonight. It was much better than the Markham location (they have different menus so maybe they aren't connected). The Orangeville roll blew my socks off. It was topped with these amazing crunchy seeds and stuff that just exploded with flavour in your mouth. The rolls are cut quite big so it barely fits in your mouth which gets unenjoyable. The fish seems fresh and the food came out quick. The restaurant is limited on seating so make sure you come early or nab a reservation. For a family of five our bill came out to $160."}
{"text":"I have eaten in and got take out from this location, and I definitely tell my friends that this is a MUST visit in Richmond Hill.
What I really enjoy about the rolls here are that they are not stuffed with rice. From the pictures, you can see all the ingredients they actually put into the sushi. I appreciate it as I am watching my carb intake, and this also makes the price a little more acceptable. 
But speaking about money, this place is a bit pricier than normal Japanese food, but I can totally accept it with the quality they provide.
The portions are very generous, and definitely fresh.
Take-out is very quick, we would order before the place opens, and we could pick it up 20 minutes after it opens. Even though it is take out, the food is very consistent. 
One downside, parking. This little mall is definitely very popular, and parking is definitely not sufficient. But there is no room for expansion, so I guess they are stuck with it.
Do give this place a try if you get the chance."}
{"text":"Mine is small yet cozy with fast service and amazing rolls and karaage. It's a shame that their menu has too much variety that it may make you indecisive. But this is a place I'd definitely visit for quality sushi."}
{"text":"I tried Mi Ne for the first time on New Year's day. I had a big craving for sushi and figured this would be one of the few places open. To my luck it was! I came here due to a friend's recommendation. She raved about the size of the rolls and how they are stuffed with fish and have very little rice which immediately caught my attention

I went with my boyfriend and we started off with soups. He got the seafood one and I got the wild mushroom. Both delicious and they stayed hot for a very long time so we were able to eat other things and come back to the soup without worrying about them getting cold. 

We also got the spicy combo which came with a spicy salmon and tuna roll,a and California. To be honest I'm not a huge salmon fan but I found both salmon and tuna tasted very similar. Maybe they were both tuna? Who knows! We also got the orangeville roll which was huge but delicious. Sometimes the fun rolls are really pretty but hard to eat but oh well at least you know they're filled with awesome stuff. Not gonna lie, part of the reason I ordered it was because SO many people posted it to yelp so I knew it had to be good!

I will definitely be back! My boyfriend who's not nearly as big of a connisseur as me said it's the best he's ever had! Maybe next time we'll check out the downtown location :)"}
{"text":"The best Sushi I've had in the GTA. 
Always fresh and the people making it are always friendly. 
Often do take out here so I can't comment too much on the restaurant itself but the food is fresh and excellent!"}
