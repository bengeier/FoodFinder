{"text":"Just a great place in general (: I've been coming here for over four years, never fails to disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, used to come here everyday for lunch. Ted, the owner is so energetic and fun, and the food is good"}
{"text":"Large variety of delicious and wholesome food. Warm, friendly staff. These two factors, along with a nice area to sit down make this place a definite win! (I particularly recommend the No.3 Sandwich and the home-made beef patty.)"}
{"text":"Mother's Deli is a fantastic spot owned by Ted, a guy who always has a smile on his face. Ted offers up great options for breakfast and lunch on the go as well as prepared meals for dinner. I always hit Ted's for his fantastic Roast Beef for sandwiches, but he has lots of options for a hot lunch. Definitely a local favorite run by a guy with a big heart!  Ted also offers up fresh Turkeys for the holidays, which are free range; freshly prepared and bottled pasta sauce at harvest time and fresh Tzatziki that is killer."}
{"text":"Great place! Homemade beef patties not very traditional but spicy and amazing ! Chocolate chip cookie is also very good. Owner is super friendly, will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This is the best deli you'll come across.  Low priced, great tasting, and good attitude.  Every thing you'll get is fresh and home made.  The owner (Ted) is nice and friendly, welcoming his guests with a wave and serving you with a smile.  The specials are to die for, usually pasta of some sort with Ted's homemade sauce for only 4.50. If you're not for pasta try something new and buy a beef patty, spicy or not, for 1.60.  Located right beside a school, it tends to be busy around 1, but this is the only downside. A nice family run place to eat in a nice neighbourhood with a friendly atmosphere. Though the kids can sometimes be loud and rowdy (I should know, I was part of them), it's still not a place to pass down. if you're in the area, go for it."}
{"text":"Ted is amazing, he and his wife know everyone in Unionville and we love them back. They also love ALL the kids who walk over from Berczy school next door for lunch and treat them all w just as much respect as a VIP - once my 11 yr old was $2 short on his lasagna meal ( I wasn't there ) and Ted said don't worry about it. The food is incredible especially veal sandwiches and those amazing shortbread desserts - I wish them all the good fortune they deserve- sincerely Trish"}
{"text":"Best roast beef sandwiches and falafel! Ted is so nice and really makes the place special. The roast beef is homemade and doesn't taste at all like the stuff you get at  grocery store. He freshly fries the falafel for each order and paired with the spicy sauce they are amazing."}
{"text":"Mother's Deli is a medium sized family-owned place, with great food for amazing prices. Their main draws are catering, lunch, and pre-cooked meals. There's an amazing assortment of options, and something for everyone, vegetarians, picky eaters, and those with allergies. Mother's is a nut-free environment, which is great for students at the school close by. For lunch, there's some great options, the special (pasta, turkey, poutine, etc.) that is only served on weekdays, pre-cooked options (homemade beef patties, sausage rolls, pockets) that are heated up for you, and sandwiches/wraps (which are fully customizable). I highly recommend the falafel wrap, a great choice for vegetarians, and the sandwiches, which are loaded with meat. Some of my personal fave meats are the homemade roast beef (a must try if you're new to mother's), the Montreal smoked meat (arguably the biggest portioned), and the spicy calabrase (That's off the standard menu, but you can order a sandwich with any meat on the deli board, just ask the price first). Ted (the owner) and his wife are friendly, and make sure you get what you want. The catering is also a big draw. I haven't had the catering, though if it is as good as everything else on the menu, you will enjoy it. They also have great free-run turkeys for the holidays (the stuffing is to die for!) and tomatoes from Mark Cullen's (a famous gardener who writes for the Toronto Star) garden. As well, check out the drinks, which are cheaper then the equivalent next door.  Considering the price, I'd say the service is the best I've had at a place with such a cheap menu. Overall, Mother's is a great lunch place with a good bang for buck.   Service: 5/5 Food: 5/5 Value: 6/5  Tips: Located fairly close to a school, it will be very busy between 12:50 and 1:50 on weekdays.  Get drinks from here instead of Daisy Mart (A convenience store next door). It's cheaper and you're supporting local business! Sandwiches can be ordered with any meat and most cheeses that are on the board. Specials are always $4.50"}
{"text":"Amazing service with a smile every time. We have been long time customers (over ten years). Ted, the owner, is great! Their beef patties are our favourite."}
{"text":"Went in for the beef patties that were sold out at 11:45am. Ugh! I went for the veal sandwich & 6.50 and the sausage roll $2.50.  The veal was dry but the rest of the sandwich was great with grilled veggies and lots of tomato sauce. The sausage roll was fantastic, especially if you like sausage rolls. Service was pretty friendly. Would go back and try the roast beef and beef patty!"}
{"text":"What a great deli should be like. Fast and friendly service and quality meats. Owner goes out of his way to make you feel like you belong and the option of picking your own buns for the kind of meat you want in your sandwich is great. Will certainly return, often."}
{"text":"My vegan buddy has been raving for months over the falafel sandwiches served at Mother's deli so I finally swung by one afternoon.   Ted, the owner of the deli is a really friendly guy who greeted us with a warm smile as soon as we came in.   I waited about ten minutes for the falafel sandwich as the falafel was being made fresh.   My buddy was right, the sandwich was delicious. The spices blended really well the toppings and the sauce that Ted added.    I was still a little hungry so Ted suggested I try one of the beef patties, which to my surprise was larger than both my hands and only $2. It was a little spicy, but Mother's deli is definitely my new go to place for falafels and beef patties."}
{"text":"Mothers is one of my go to places since he has been on Carleton. Ted contributes to the community and is a true family run establishment.  Great turkeys, fantastic tomato sauce and much much more!"}
{"text":"Really good made to order sandwiches! Basic, fresh, and uncomplicated. The beef samosas are perfect for a snack. Staff are very friendly, especially the owner.   If they had a few other sides for lunch, the seating area would be a bit more inviting."}
{"text":"Yep, I live nearby in walking distance and I have always said for years we need a bakery and deli on the strip. Great sandwiches at a good price, nice staff. Time to diversify a little with more of a selection of whole wheat and additional styles of bread products, for starters. Consider opening on Sundays 1/2 days, in order to minimize stale dated potentials and allow us more shopping opportunities"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and great service! Ted is super friendly and the prices are very fair. Definitely recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"Hands down legit roast beef sandwich!!  Ted is super friendly and eager talk, prices are fair!  This place has foodie written all over it!  Tee tells me they are know for their roast beef sandwich,  I saw the massive chunk of roast roast, home cooked, medium to medium raw, and Ted was feeding through a Deli slicing machine. The roast beef is legit, no preservatives, home cooked roast beef.  $6.50 plus Tax."}
{"text":"Best deli ever great sandwich's and also amazing assortment of cheese and meat and bread.They also have a great selection of take home appetizers like samosa and patty which are delicious.The Thursday special sandwich was philly cheeseteak best sandwich i have ever had definitely would recommend"}
{"text":"I was really sad when I found out that my favourite Raymerville Deli and Bakery closed down after 35 years. It was a high school favourite back in the day, so off I went to go find another deli for my sandwich cravings.  This shop popped up on Yelp and it was Italian as well so I had to go try. I ordered the Fight Club, Homemade roast beef, and the Falafel (vegan). They don't exactly tell you the ingredients of the Fight club, but upon eating it, it looked like a mixture of prosciutto, black forest ham and another type of ham? (not sure). All the sandwiches were delicious with the option of adding red peppers, and other condiments! You are also able to pick the type of bread you want (from rolls to pizza shaped to bagels) Simple and lots of meat for the price ($7.99). I just wish they had a little bit more options for types of deli meat, but I will return again for my fill."}
{"text":"Wonderful bakery with delicious sandwiches!  Mother's bakery is small local bakery located along Main Street which has an easy to find red sign. As you go in, you will be greeted with a tasty dessert case with about 4-5 tables for seating. But the back is where the magic happens! At the rear, you will find loaves of fresh baked bread, buns and bagels along with a deli counter. They have a standard daily menu with funky names for sandwiches along with the daily specials on a chalk board. To start, you grab some tongs and pick your bun, next up decide on your meat, cheese and topping. They also have a small prepared salad area to go with your sandwich. I ordered the chicken parmigiana and a falafel pita. First up, the falafel was nice and crunchy in a soft pita - great taste at a a great price. But the winner is the chicken parmigiana - inside I had 2 big slices of crispy breaded chicken layered with a sweet tomatoes sauce and sweet peppers. The bread was soft and chewy which was perfect to absorb the sauce - overall an excellent lunch! I also noticed they have a variety of cold and frozen entrees like stuffed peppers, eggplant parmigiana, soups and etc. I will definitely come back to try others. Great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"I've been here for years, ever since I was an elementary student at the school nearby. Not only is the boss there friendly and eager to make conversation with you, the food is great and cooked with a lot of favour. Always a plus!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness if I could give a thousand stars, I would. My family and I have been eating the roast beef sandwich for over 20 years. It is absolutely delicious in every way. We are not talking cold cuts - this is FRESH BEEF, they make in-house and slice to order. It is perfectly medium-rare EVERY SINGLE TIME. Equally amazing is that the owner is gracious, friendly, and unendingly hospitable. Worth the trip every time!"}
