{"text":"This is a very cool new bar and restaurant.  The atmosphere is fantastic, but I can't recommend the food.  On our first visit, we got the giambotta: the pork was very salty, and the chimichurri was even saltier. Worse, I kept pulling out unchewable pieces of gristle--AWKWARD!  We decided to give it another try, but the second time was not the charm. The chicken parmigiana sandwich my sister tried was overcooked and REALLY dry, the sugary sauce tasted like it came out of a jar, and the Mac and cheese side was soupy. Based on a previous review, I had the build-your-own ham and cheese, which was nothing special. Yawn.  Again, great atmosphere and beer selection, but we will not be ordering food here again."}
{"text":"The food is fine but the waitresses are terrible. Went in at 4 when it was not busy at all. Sat and ordered food immediately and didn't get it for 40 minutes. It was annoying but if the waitress would have at least acknowledged  that it was taking longer it would have been ok. The staff stands around and talks to each other. I witnessed a guy waiting to pay for a carry out order for 5 minutes before someone acknowledged that  he was there."}
{"text":"Update:   Went today for lunch, and decided to try something different. Got the Mac N Cheese, and a salad. Neither were good. Mac N Cheese was lacking cheese and flavor, and the salad's chicken was way overcooked. What's up with that? Hope that this was just an anomaly."}
{"text":"Had the Buffalo wings and cheese sticks off the appetizer menu. Everything was great. Food, service,  and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My low rating is not due to the food, which everyone in my party considered to be decent, but the poor etiquette of the management.  One of my friends has a critical dairy allergy, and when he asked the manager how they prepared their mayonnaise, the manager replied \"do I look like the ****ing cook to you, buddy?\"  Then he left in a huff.  Whether he was having a poor day, I can't say, but this is no way to treat customers."}
{"text":"Food was great! We had the black and yellow sandwich, burger and sweet potato fries which were all excellent. Service was so-so and there's no changing station for little ones."}
{"text":"Roast Public House is my favorite place to go grab a healthier meal on State Street. It has a very casual ambiance and great locally sourced food and drinks. Its perfect for a laid-back lunch or fun date night, because everything is reasonably priced but made with high quality ingredients. It serves as a nice getaway from all the fast food spots on State Street, as long as you can beat the crowds since it is a smaller venue. The staff is friendly and they put a jug of water on your table so they don't have to keep coming back to fill drinks. It is definitely worth trying their slow roasted pork shoulder, and be sure to get the cheese curds as an app and the sweet potato fries for your side."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. It's decent food at a decent price. The beer selection is pretty good, and their sandwiches (the Grateful Red, White Cap Roast Beef) are also pretty good, though they always seem to be missing something. For example, their Grateful Red sandwich includes a Stella Cheese Bread bun - which was unavailable the second time we went. That is disappointing. Service was okay both times, nothing to write home about. I'll go back if I'm in the mood for roast beef."}
{"text":"The roast beef was bland and boring. It took a long time. Didn't love the ambience.  I always get a little annoyed when I see someone review a fancy restaurant (that I love) and criticize them for their $20 hamburger, so perhaps I should be a little kinder here given what might be appropriate expectations - but honestly I expected something...more."}
{"text":"The sandwiches and burger were tasty but smallish for the price. The choice of bun/bread was a very nice option. The sweet potato fries were delicious according to my daughter. The regular fries had a seasoning two of us didn't care for and the chips that came with the sandwich were crispy but totally tasteless. Service was okay but had to ask for napkins and utensils. With so many choices out there I doubt I would return."}
{"text":"They told us the wait would be 45 minutes, so we put our number down and went home, 15 minutes later they texted us and told us our table was ready and that we had 10 minutes to get there. We got back 7 MINUTES AFTER THE TEXT WAS SENT and our name was taken off the list and we had to go back at the end of the list. Complete bullshit and they didn't even care to accommodate. The management sucks."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed in Roast. Being a big fan of unique and specialty sandwiches, I had high hopes for Roast. I ordered their Cajun Brisket sandwich, which was $10.50. I thought a sandwich for $10.50 was pretty expensive, but figured it would be a decently sized portion and would be of high quality.  I was wrong on both accounts. There was probably 4 ounces of brisket and some slaw on a normal sized pretzel bun. The meat wasn't tough or anything, it just didn't really stand out in any way, nor did the sandwich as a whole. Very frustrating, given that I wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Good fresh food and great portions. I should have paid more attention to the menu, but I ordered the sandwich and the waitress asked what side I would like, she rattled them off - I picked the fries. The she recommended a dipping sauce, I picked one. Then the bill arrived and I was charged separately for the fries and $.25 for the sauce - rather irritating that she made it sound as if these items were included. Very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"It's good but I expected so much more, given the hype that I had heard from other people.  Me and my sister went when it was slow so the service was great, no fighting for seats, quiet, nice, etc.  Good decor.  So that was a plus.  But I couldn't understand why they had a college baseball game on TV. Couldn't they find ONE pro game, even if the Brewers weren't playing?  The food was good, but it wasn't what I would call great. It didn't knock my socks off. The mozzarella stick appetizer was supposed to be \"Buffalo stuffed\" and they were good, but again: no strong buffalo stuffed flavor except in the dressing on the side. I had the Bacon and Pesto grilled cheese. I couldn't really taste the pesto. And the cheese was nothing special. But it was okay.  They also don;t put any salt on their homemade chips. Once again they were okay but not great.   2 sandwiches, a beer, a soda, and the Buffalo Stuffed Mozzarella sticks appetizer came up to $32.23 with tax so with tip about $40 for 2 people. A little pricey.  My suggestion? Get the sandwiches to go and save yourself the tip and the extra over-priced trimmings."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is deeeeeeeeelicious!  I went traditional and got the roast beef sandwich with mozz, grilled onion jam, brown gravy, and fries on top. The onion jam is so tasty. I really love the concept of this place, and I hope they continue to do well. Boy got a pork belly reuben and found the bread to be a bit too greasy, but he agreed that I ordered better. Sweet potato fries and regular fries are standard Sodexho fare, but the chips that come with the sammies are quite good. I'm sure we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Clumsy ordering system with no help from hip hop wait staff only to receive dry, burnt food. Pass."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for good sandwiches, HUGE servings.   the menu is composed primarily of burgers and sandwiches (with a couple of salads for good measure), which are served alongside home-fried potato crisps.   it's a decently long, spacious place - fancy high seats in one half, and more family-oriented booths on the other. service is young, and sometimes attentive, but you can go a while if you're trying to grab their attention when they don't expect it (I. E. in between ordering and paying).   almost everything we had was good, like the mozzarella sticks we started with, which were crunchy outside and satisfying oozey within - and the pulled pork or bruschetta chicken sandwiches. my sister was particularly enamoured of the roast burger, which was juicy, properly cooked pink, and topped with bacon.   but I liked my harvest salad, which was more fruit salad topped with my add-on of grilled chicken (only $2.50, but it's a large amount of meat).   this place is also good for imbibing one of the wisconsin new glarus beers, such as the spotted cow."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places for business lunches on state street. Fairly standard pub and BBQ fare with a gourmet twist. The prices are slightly higher however and the quality of service has been variable. Overall, I recommend. Really good soups in the winter."}
{"text":"Some of the best and most creative sandwiches around.  Had the cajun brisket and the Roast beef dip, both were fantastic. The cajun had incredible flavor and the BBQ sauce was clearly homemade. I subbed the house cut fries and sweet potato fries and would recommend both.  service was good (you order at the counter and then the food is brought out to you)  decor is fun and inviting  Definitely coming back to try more of the sandwiches.  PS, ask for a side of their Siracha Lime Aioli to dip your fries in."}
{"text":"There are reviews about the bar and about the food, this one is about the food at lunch time.  I had the signature Roast Dip sandwich with homemade chips and a pickle.  The bread for the sandwich was stale, the beef in the sandwich was OK, the dip, well, the dip was not dip, it was THICK beef soup.  There is no way this dip can be described as any sort of dip for a roast beef sandwich, again, it was THICK goo.  The pickle was withered and dry, the chips were OK, but I could taste the burnt oil a little.  The service, what service?  I was told to seat myself, the waitress took the order, somebody else served the order, after I was done I waited a while and the finally got the check.  So, all the waitress did was take the order and give me a check. Great Dane, Hawks, you name it, they all have better bar food!  Not going back!  Oh, and it smelled of Lysol."}
{"text":"I come here almost exclusively for the sweet potato encrusted chicken tenders. They are hands down the best chicken tenders I've ever had. The two dipping sauces they come with are incredible. I usually order this as my dinner even though it's an appetizer and it's enough for me. The salads are kind of bland, not too special. I order the harvest salad and it's pretty decent for the price. I get the small and it is really quite tiny. The service isn't the best but they're always super friendly. It does get pretty crowded-- always full of students and has a really fun, casual vibe to it.    It's a good place to go for an inexpensive bite with friends. Just don't hold everything up to the chicken tender standard and you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon in October. We were seated promptly but the place was about 80% full. Our server, Jake, was friendly and efficient. There is a wide variety of sandwiches and beverages. I had the \"Beef Dip\" - an. outstanding roast beef sandwich that had very high quality beef and a great bun along with sweet potato fries.   My wife had the \"California\" which was a combination of veggies, avacado and other tasty ingredients along with homemade not at all greasy kettle chips - about the best we've tasted.   There was a nice size bar that had a handful of folks quietly having a cocktail. The place has a large selection of local beers although I wimped out and had a light tapper.  All in all - we thoroughly enjoyed our meals and both agree we'd be regulars if we lived in the area. Highly recommend for lunch or a casual dinner."}
{"text":"I eat here once a week.. Gets better and better every time I go. I love it! Great ambiance!"}
{"text":"I had the ham sandwich a few months ago and mouth is watering just thinking about it.  I am mad at myself for not making it back here yet.  The ham was AMAZING and full of flavor.  I savored every bite I took.  I think it took me like 30 minutes to eat this sandwhich simply because I didn't want to take my last bite.  Congrats to these young guys who started this place.   They had a quite a few tv's.  We were there in a big group to watch the Big 10 championship place.  I would definitely go there to watch a game again.  Get there early though for tables.  The bar and other tables were filled with college kids but the place is probably more meant for them (location on state st and owned by 2 recent college grads) so it was nice of them to \"share it\" with us 25-35 year olds."}
{"text":"This place has a great location on campus and serves pretty tasty dishes, although a little greasy. I pretty much agree with everyone else, except that the food isn't worth the $8 or $9 they charge you per sandwich, and the food isn't anything new. You could go out for a larger meal for the same price in other location close to campus. It's worth one stop, but I wouldn't go back again unless someone invited me."}
{"text":"A great new place on state street to check out.  The owner and bartenders were friendly and happy to talk about the establishment.  We just had drinks but the food looks and sounds bomb.  Great place for after studying/work cocktails for graduate students."}
{"text":"11/26/2016 Terrible service by Nick T. More concerned with chatting with his friends then checking on his table. Waited for close to 15 minutes before he noticed we were finished eating. Then waited another 10 min for the check. Literally sat there for 25 plus minutes waiting to leave. Food was basic and cold. Cold soup, fries, sandwiches etc. Couldn't get Nick's attention from his friends to ask for the food to be warmed. He never stopped back after we got our food etc. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I love this place! Most places I like one or two items on their menu. I have been going here since they opened and usually have something different every time as they have daily specials as well. Never left disappointed"}
{"text":"Exceptional allergy assistance and accomodations. Had gluten free bread and didn't make me feel like a pain in the butt."}
{"text":"Despite claiming I would not be back after my last review, a friend talked me into having lunch there again.  They have pared down their menu considerably even since last fall (it seems), and they have also pared down their portion size. My friend had a wrap that was clearly made with the smallest tortilla possible (it wasn't even the length of my hand), and my cup of chili was smaller than the average coffee cup.  There is quite a bit of chicken on the lunch menu but only two meat dishes:  the pulled pork sandwich and the \"barely naked burger.\"  (I really miss the steak salad!)  I guess lunch isn't their emphasis anymore."}
{"text":"Came here twice. I ordered mac n cheese on both occasions and they're either a hit or miss. One day they're flavorful with an assortment of melted cheeses, the next, they're goopy and severely under seasoned.    I tried their roast beef tip sandwich. Wasn't a big fan at all. Their bread is just way too thick and hard when toasted. The roast beef tasted like plain ol' warmed up deli beef.   If you're going to order anything, order their wings. They're delicious - especially their maple sriracha sauce. It has the right balance of heat!"}
{"text":"I honestly wasn't that impressed- I had high hopes after seeing everyone loving on some of my favorites: buffalo chicken and sweet potato fries. The wrap was nothing special, and they brought me regular fries. The wait time was incredibly long and the guy waiting on us (we sat at the bar) could barely take his attention away from the drunk coeds sitting a few seats down long enough to get our order. Overall disappointing food and service, but the Spotted Cow was delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is not that great. The mac and cheese had absolutely no flavor, and the salad I ordered was nothing special and looked like something I could have made at home myself. My friend ordered a salad and didn't like it, so she sent it back. The waitress asked if she would like anything else instead and my friend declined. When the bills came they charged my friend for the salad. The waitress explained that her manager said that since there was nothing wrong with the food that he was not going to take the salad off of her bill. The waitress was very polite and felt very bad for my friend, but stated her manager refused to allow her to take the salad off of the bill.   Way to have crappy customer service on top of not so fabulous food that is served on PLASTIC plates. I will never go back to this place ever again. Have fun serving students that are ok with flavorless and not so fabulous food. This is probably the only way you will end up staying in business."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a late Sunday lunch there with the hubs. The space is really cool- love the exposed walls- don't know if they're faux or not but they're beautiful. The TVs were on showing a game, but the sound was off- perfect! He had the Turkey Spinach Dip panini, I had the pulled pork on a pretzel- both were great. Our server was friendly and responsive- no complaints there. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Update: the owner of The Roast got back to me through yelp and was very apologetic and very responsive toy complaints and is workong to ensure there are no further issues.  Thank you very much!"}
{"text":"You order at a counter and that is just weird.  The sandwich was mediocre, but the Mac and Cheese was good.  I probably will not be back."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've felt compelled to write a Yelp review, but I felt like more folks should know what a fantastic meal I experienced at Roast. Probably would be a five star review but for one minor detail; we (my daughter and I) were somewhat unsure of what to do with ourselves when we walked in & it took a few minutes to figure out that we should go to the back of the space to order at a counter.  Some signage, or someone letting us know, would've been great.  But all in all, who cares- everything else was remarkable.  Love the interior- brick walls, hardwood tables, terrazzo floors, and cool vintage maps.   Sorry, Roast- I had low expectations.  That far down State Street I worried I'd be wandering into a raucous college bar with food as an afterthought.  Even though the Pearl Jam in the background gave me slight pause, I am happy to say I was 100% wrong.  The menu was tantalizing.  Literally everything on there sounded creative and delicious- and still somehow cheap! All $8 or less. I was particularly intrigued by the pork shoulder/cherry pepper gravy sandwich and the \"Gialla Rosa\" (free range turkey, jalapeno cranberry relish, and brie... mmm) Since I don't eat wheat, I figured I'd be relegated to a salad- not to worry, there were many options.    My daughter and I ordered- she got a Boylan soda and one of the specials of the day (a guacamole burger) and I got a diet Coke and the Asian Chicken Salad.  We sat down and our food came out in less than ten minutes.  The server was friendly and prepared- he had napkins at the ready before I even asked for extra napkins- and the food looked and smelled great. My salad was enormous, beautifully plated and colorful.  Best of all, it was composed perfectly.  Equal parts Napa cabbage and romaine, with loads of fresh chopped bok choy.  Plus purple cabbage, shredded carrots, lots of pea pods and red pepper, cucumbers, and cilantro.  On top was an obviously freshly grilled chicken breast, still slightly warm, seasoned well and cooked perfectly- neither rubbery nor dry.  The dressing was a zippy peanut/sesame vinaigrette served on the side.  I could not believe the flavor and freshness of this salad.  It surpassed any salad I've had at fancier establishments up on the square in portion size, amount of veggies, and taste- and it was only  eight bucks.   Meanwhile, my daughter was enjoying and devouring her burger, which came on a clearly homemade brioche bun, with shredded lettuce, a generous slather of what looked (and tasted) to be just-made guac, and a perfectly balanced chipotle aioli.  I cannot forget to mention the bacon- two huge slices in an X across the burger, thick cut, smoked, and cooked just right.  I was able to steal two bites of the bacon and if they're not using local bacon, it's definitely a higher-end bacon.   She had a side of their house hand cut fries, which were also wonderful, looked like the frites at jacs or Brasserie V but tasted even better- and not greasy! $2.50 for a side of these is a freaking steal.    All in all, I want to give these guys kudos and hope they do well.  I used to work on the square and had lunch at the restaurants near my office all the time (Merchant, Graze, Marigold, Coopers, etc.) and what Roast is accomplishing regarding sandwiches/salad seems a notch well above any of those offerings; if I worked downtown now, those other places would be a distant second choice."}
{"text":"I've been to Roast a handful of times, and their food is pretty standard in terms of their sandwiches, but in this time I have found the dishes that to me, stick out and make Roast worth a visit.  Let me start with these pulled pork nachos; this is not something you will regret except maybe being really full after. They use a white cheese and it is absolutely delicious. The giant dollop of guacamole on top does not disappoint, but the pulled pork is a little bit dry. The nachos could use a bit more of a kick perhaps in the queso, but they are a little pieces of jalapeno sprinkled throughout, although a bottle of Cholula at the table wouldn't be a bad idea.   Secondly, these sweet potato fries are some of the best around the downtown area in that they are thick cut, but crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. A giant plate of them came with some kind of mayonnaise based sauce with a little bit of a spice, and it complimented the fries well.  Service is nothing amazing, but during busy hours, it's a little chaotic for my liking. Roast is worth a visit during off hours if you'd like to enjoy the company you're with over a beer and hot food."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre and food was tasteless. I ordered a cheese steak like sandwich.  I should have known that I was not in Philadelphia.  The only times that we say our waitress was when she took our order and brought our check.  No checking in to see if we wanted refills, if there was anything else she could bring us, etc.  Won't be returning!"}
{"text":"Heard of \"lipstick on a pig\"? If you like decor and beer, then...sure.  Service and food,  absolutely NO.  Took the family and grandma out to Roast before going to a show at the Overture.  35 minutes after ordering our food (and a messed up mohito and a hungry kid's head on the table) we inquired about our order. Waitress told us a cook didn't show up but she would check on the status of our order (Btw never saw her again). We waited 10-15 more minutes and had to leave, hungry, to get to the show.    After giving feedback they comped our drinks. Decor is nice, service was terrible, and for our food...don't know we never got any nor were we offered anything while we waited. It's a \"Lipstick on a pig\" establishment for sure."}
{"text":"Food was underwhelming and a bit overpriced. Ambience and service were OK. It's possibly the nicest \"creative pub food\" place on State Street and as another reviewer points out -- a good man-date level of decor.  Fries, sweet potato fries, and aoili were very good but sandwiches were generally blah.  I had the Bucky Burger ($11 w/ fries). It was pretty small and didn't come with any fixings aside from a really blah pickle spear on the side -- it was just the burger, sauce, slice of cheese, bit of beef brisket on top, and bun (the bun was very good). The patty was too densely packed and came well-done (i.e., they don't come medium or medium rare nor did they ask how I wanted my burger). Were the burgers pre-made? They source most of their meats from Black Earth -- generally a good sign because other delicious places in town do, too.  The place was bit nicer than Dotty's Dumpling Dowry but the food definitely didn't compare. A decent place for a meal if you want a place to have a conversation. The more artisinal, original sandwiches that my friends ordered seemed interesting but I figured it'd be easier to judge the merits of this place on its burger.  It's kind of \"seat yourself\" with a bar, long row of bar-stool tables and a few booths."}
{"text":"Clueless staff. Ordered to go. Had to ask for my card back. Then had to go back because there was no dressing for the salad and no fork. Frist and last time."}
{"text":"Roast is one of the best places in Madison to get cheese curds. The menu is always packed with delicious options for everyone. I like to come here to catch up with friends or to sit at the bar to watch a Badger football game. The service is also amazing, always the nicest staff."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: cool, trendy restaurant/pub with promise.  I wanted badly to love Roast Public House, and admittedly we came after a Badger home game to this State Street hangout. That's probably our mistake, but that being said my impressions weren't great.   It's a cool space, and would be extremely comfortable if it hadn't been so full. While waiting for a table the hostess let us go to the bar and get a drink. This actually caused more issues, as the bar area became so packed that servers and guests couldn't get through. Plenty of local craft brews, most around $5-$6.  Once we got a seat our food came out quickly. We started with Chips and Guac ($7), which was just okay. This isn't a Mexican restaurant, and you could tell it was kind of hastily thrown together. I ordered the soup of the day, which again in hindsight was a poor choice considering how badly the waitress explained what it was. My bowl ($4.50) of Chicken Black Bean soup was unbelievably watery and lifeless. It was like spooning water that had had some black beans sitting in it for a while into my mouth. The chicken pieces were small and almost too symmetrically cut, like they were from a processing plant.   I did get to try some of the homemade fries from a friend, which were delicious. And their burgers looked totally right as well. I made the wrong food choice, obviously, but I didn't find much in a reason to come back to Roast either. Maybe I'd try again on a calmer day, and stick to pub food."}
{"text":"I love Roast, I've eaten here a few times and it's definitely a good place for casual night out or  date night. The cheese curds are great. (I mean I really haven't had bad cheese curds) The Bruschetta chicken is really good. Their house made bruschetta makes the sandwich fresh and the pesto aioli makes it savory as well. I always get them with the sweet potato fries with the sriracha lime aioli. This restaurant also keeps things fresh and new with specials of the month. I will definitely come back here"}
{"text":"great sandwiches. Fun location on State St. stack up the sandwich with all the meats and cheeses!"}
{"text":"Really good cubano sandwich and cheese curds. Server was friendly. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"Super yummy! We had to get it to go, but the service was speedy. Would tell anyone to go there and get the cheese curds and the sweet potato fries. I ate the avocado smash burger and it was very filling. Also took a bite of the pineapple pork sandwich and it was the perfect flavor combination. Would return here if we were in Madison!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and an impressive local tap list make this place worthy of a mandatory once a month visit. Friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"The food & atmosphere is great, but the service was horrible. There was only one waitress covering the entire restaurant, and she had to do everything. We saw several people come in and leave because there was no one helping them for up to 10 minutes. I don't know if it was an off day, but they need to hire more help & have better customer service. I would try it again because of the food, but hopefully with better service."}
{"text":"Roast is one of THE BEST sandwich places in Madison. Not only do they have great food, but a really fun vibe as well. They have a bunch of beers on tap as well as bottled. You can find many different Wisconsin beers there.   Any of their sandwiches are great.... But the best is the turkey spinach dip panini. They changed the bread on it recently, so now it's just a sandwich and not a panini, but it's still good. I also love the black and yellow.   For sides, make sure to get the French fries and the sriracha aioli. So good. Their sweet potato fries are also great.   The only major downside is they normally have a wait.... Especially on the weekends. I would recommend getting there earlier rather than later... They can accommodate pretty big groups if there's space though."}
{"text":"Roast is a decent place for lunch, and I would be up for going back here to grab a few beers during happy hour.  I've eaten here two times. I don't care much for kettle chips (without a lot of salt), which are normally served with the sandwiches. The second time I had the prime rib sandwich (the special) and it was decent. I think a side of au jus would have kicked it up a notch. The side salad was fresh with a nice balsamic vinaigrette.   I don't plan to come back but it's a decent spot for a quick bite on state street."}
{"text":"A vintage Wisconsin place! The cheese curds are some the best I have every had. The same can be said about the sweet potato fries. There is a lot of variety on both the food and drink menus, which is always a plus. A must-try when in Madison."}
{"text":"I'm really sad to write this review. I don't like writing bad reviews.   My friend and I stopped by here to eat last night and it was very disappointing. Our waitress was great; very friendly so no problems with service, it was just the food.  I got the pulled pork nachos and my friend got a sandwich and sweet potato fries. She enjoyed her dish, so that's awesome! My nachos were bland, the homemade cheese sauce, while decently tasty, was a liquid at the bottom of the dish and the pork just tasted like boiled pulled pork. The guac tasted kind of like olives but was also bland. I added salt and pepper, didn't help much. I also got the fries and a side of the lemon-garlic aoli which was also bland. The fries were fine; cooked well and I got a big pile of them.   I also ordered an old fashioned and maybe it's my fault for not specifying what kind of liquor, but it was made with whiskey and I couldn't drink it. To the bartenders credit, she remade it without asking and it was better but I still couldn't finish it. They did comp the drink though, which was thoughtful and I tipped extra for it.   Overall, I don't think I'd come back."}
{"text":"Roast is a new spot to State St., taking the old Buffalo Wild Wings' location. I had only heard good things about the place, so I decided to give it a shot.   I went with the Turkey Spinach Dip Panini, and it was amazing. I had a couple friends who went with the Brisket, and they only had good things to say.   The service was great as well, they offer a really simple order at the counter - sit down - have your meal delivered system that makes it really easy on the customer.   Everything else aside, they have something no other place in the area does; ping pong. That's right, they have a ping pong table in the basement. Coming from a diehard fan of the sport, this aspect completely sold me.   No doubt I'll be back just to play a little ping pong, and can't wait to try the other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Super loud, pretty dirty, and overstressed servers make for a pretty unwelcoming experience.   The sandwiches look pretty good, but I wanted some cheese curd and was disappointed there was none to be found.  They have a respectable number of beers on tap emphasizing microbreweries and local favs which was nice.  Otherwise I don't see much reason to return to Roast Public House."}
{"text":"Our party of 2 had a good lunch.  The Cajun  sandwich was great,  and surprisingly not to spicy for a wimp like me.  The sweet potato fries were amazing and totally worth the upcharge.  The Mac and cheese,  however,  was more expensive and definitely  NOT worth anything extra.  Overall pretty good,  especially for a drop in lunch."}
{"text":"This was a surprising find on State St. I had heard that it was good but when the food came out I fell in love with my sandwich and our waiters beer pairing suggestions for our food was spot on.  The service was great, the bartenders friendly and I cannot stop raving about the food."}
{"text":"Roast Public House is doing something right because I keep coming back. The decor is contemporary and the staff is friendly. My favorite sandwich is the Black and Yellow. This chicken sandwich is full of flavor. The aioli and guacamole really take the sandwich over the top. I've ordered the mac and cheese as a side twice. I do recall enjoying it more the first time. The second time the mac lacked flavor and in general was a bit on the greasy (not cheesy) side. That's okay, I'll just keep ordering their homemade chips which are bomb. On my last visit, I was lucky enough to enjoy their patio seating with my pooch. A dog friendly patio is always a big plus in my book. The server even brought out some water for my dog. This place is on my \"frequent visit\" list!"}
{"text":"Great, place to get a burger. Atmosphere is very cool. There is outdoor seating on State that's a great place to people watch. Guacamole burger is fantastic. I didn't like homemade chips tho. Service is intermittent. Took a long time to get a table but to was game day. Once we got a table it took forever for the waitress to show up and take our drink order. Food came out quickly tho. I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Always the worst service and food is always subpar, never great. Drinks are overpriced for what they are (cheap rail)"}
{"text":"Delicious drinks. Great service. Homemade soups were amazing.  Pulled pork melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"The pineapple pork sandwich was delicious! Chips are ok. Could use flavor. Server was great. I'd come back."}
{"text":"I almost never write reviews and write negative ones even more rarely but this was a bad brunch.   It was our first time at Roast and we were seated at a high top (probably good for drinks, too narrow for food comfortably but not a big deal as long as you're with people who are okay with occasional accidental footsie). It must have been really close to a speaker because the music was loud, especially for an early Sunday afternoon.   The wait staff was clearly slammed and trying but couldn't get to everything. We ordered coffee after about 10 minutes and put in our food order at the same time. 10 minutes later, I asked about our coffee and was told they didn't have any cups. Shortly after, we were informed that they didn't have decaf at all. A few minutes after that, I had a cup of regular coffee. Fortunately, I prefer my coffee black because that was my only option.   Our food came out relatively quickly and was fine but a little on the bland side. I didn't get everything I ordered but what from what we did get: eggs were fine, potatoes were a little under seasoned, toast was 100% plain and, since the wait staff was busy, it took a while to ask for butter or anything else. When it did come (quickly after asking), the butter looked like it was scooped and smushed in plastic cups and 3 jam packets were thrown in a juice cup.   I asked for a refill of coffee when we were offered the check and was told they were out (with an hour left on their brunch menu). I was admittedly a little startled and that was probably apparent.   Check came and was incorrect (kind of a good thing in this case since if I had gotten everything I ordered I would have been charged $2 for 4 tiny slivers of avocado as a \"side\" to my eggs). We spoke with the server and, after some clarification on some apparent kitchen confusion, she removed both the $2 avocado surcharge (which I requested because it was incorrect) and the $3 cup of black drip coffee (which I did not request but I appreciated given the situation - also why this is a 2 star review instead of 1 star).   Despite receiving some attitude for the last couple interactions, it's just evident they really need more help.   Given how many good places there are to eat in Madison for brunch, I'd recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"I visited Roast on a weeknight with some friends. We were attending an event later in the evening, so we opted for a lighter fare. I chose cheese curds (still on a mission to try every curd in Madison) which were very good - tasty and well-cooked - and a small southwest salad. I am not a salad person by nature, but I really didn't need a full meal...and everybody else ordered a said, so I just followed suit!  The southwest salad usually comes with chicken, but I opted for a vegetarian version, which was delicious. It almost made we want to be a salad person! I ordered some kind of yummy cranberry apple beer that was delicious. I am not enough of a beer snob to remember the exact name. ;)   Our server was exceptionally friendly and helpful when we were trying to make our dinner decisions. The bar was decorated for Christmas and just overall had a fun, laid back atmosphere. I will definitely be back to Roast the next time I'm on State Street!"}
{"text":"This place is WITH-OUT-A-DOUBT my favorite place to grab a bite on State. While I'll lean towards other places for a more formal dinner (i.e. when my parents come into town), I can't think of a place I'd rather go to with my friends on a Saturday afternoon. The list of sandwiches is just right: not too short, not too long. I never have trouble deciding what I want. Roast takes classic flavors and elevates them just a touch without added pretentiousness. My favorites on the menu include the California Avocado and the sweet potato fries with Sriracha-lime sauce (obviously). If I'm feeling like going a little healthy...I'll grab a side salad. The sweet balsamic vinaigrette is to-die. I'll even ask for a little extra to dip my sandwich in.  Overall, it's a great establishment and an excellent addition to the area. The only reason that it doesn't get 5 stars is because it's a little pricey and service up front and at the table tends to be abysmal when it's busy."}
{"text":"Casual dining close to UW Madison.   Very personable servers. Ambiance is comfy but with a very cool vibe. Draft beer options change, many locals and craft brews available. I had a Spotted Cow. Why mess with what you know is good?   For food we shared cheese curds. They were great. I had the Grateful Red, which is a buffalo chicken sandwich with home made chips. I only finished half and took half to go as it was filling. Good sandwich with quality ingredients.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This is a good place to meet up with friends, have a few drinks, and eat some decent food. We had the Sriracha Lime Wings and the Sweet Potato Crusted Chicken Tenders. Both were good. The Sriracha Aoli dipping sauce for the tenders was good.I tried a friend's fries and they were really good (twice-fried). This is not a craft cocktail gastropub as I initially suspected from the website. The tap list is good and there's a decent selection of booze but the college-crowd probably doesn't demand more than a Jack & Coke, so the bartender we had was not phenomenal. I had two Manhattans and they tasted very different. Also, the beer pours were all short (like almost a full inch short of the rim of the glass).   Still, a comfortable atmosphere and a step above most of the dive bars on and near State Street."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch - place caught our eye with a little area of our door seating and an interesting menu.   Walking in we liked the decor, were greeted nicely - but their was this smell of cleaning chemicals that was a bit strong. I'm a bit sensitive to this, affects my appetite, but I was happy to know the place was clean.   We sat up front so we could people watch out the window. Server was nice and fast. I ordered their Guinness Brisket sandwich and my wife got the hummus salad. The sandwich was good, but the menu said it was on sourdough - and it might of been - but tasted like a hamburger bun. I've never had sourdough with sesame seeds. The horseradish sauce on it was ok, but not very hot. I think most people see \"horseradish\" and expect a little zing! Chips were great and not too salty which I love. Wife's salad was good too, though it didn't blow her away. Portion was big which was nice.   We didn't get to try the taps, but you could see there was a substantial selection. Ok food and nice staff good atmosphere. We will most likely try again sometime."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience with the family, visiting my UW Madison student.  Prior arrangements fell through and we had to bring the dog along. The Roast had seating set up outside and we were allowed to have the dog sit with us. We all just had a wonderful time. Very nice post game atmosphere."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a Sunday and we were blown away by the service, beer selection and the food.   My boyfriend's curd burger was amazing and we'll definitely be back just for that burger.  The sweet potato fries are the way to go."}
{"text":"Awesome experience.  Was in with a group of 8 from New York from Homecoming and this place couldn't have been a more perfect fit.  Went for dinner on Friday night  and then came back during Freakfest.    The food was great.  I had the meatball sandwich but as a group we sampled a bunch of things.  Mac and Cheese side is a must.   Drinks also really good.  Get the Farley - trust me.    The entire staff couldn't be nicer.  Chef came out and is incredibly passionate about his food.  Doug, the co-owner, was incredibly friendly and helpful.    This place is a perfect addition to State Street.  We'll be back.  Jason"}
{"text":"Came for lunch and to watch a game. Nice atmosphere. Food was decent. Bar had a nice beer selection. However, my husband and I sat at the bar and both bartenders were extremely unfriendly and offered poor service."}
{"text":"I would rate their food and menu quality a 5. Seriously awesome and diverse choices and they have never disappointed me.  It keeps be coming back.  However...90/100 of the times I have gone to Roast it is packed and the service is horrible. In most of my experience, I was lucky to see your server twice. I get it, the place is hyped. But I would definitely go like once a week if this weren't the case. Don't go for the service... go for the sweet potato fries. Or Grateful Red sandwich. Or anything. But expect to wait."}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch the other day. I'm a fan of the concept: coffee bar, beer bar, local food, sandwiches, salads, etc. I got a soup/salad combo and really liked both although the sizes were a little weird. Tiny bowl of soup, huge side salad. Makes me wonder how enormous a regular size salad is.  Anyway, the only reason I'm rating this place a three is because of its location. If it wasn't right on State St, I would probably be a repeat customer for sure. But because it's ten feet from campus, it's filled with a very high concentration of bros and dudes and sorority girls. No offense to any of them, it's just not the vibe I'm usually looking for when I want to sit down for a meal."}
{"text":"Yikes.   I've been to Roast twice, and after similar experiences both times, I won't be back.   The food is fine - greasy, somewhat bland. Nothing to get too excited over. I've had comparable burgers and wraps at Wendy's.   But where Roast really comes off the rails is the service. Being in a college town, Roast seems to have really taken the atmosphere to heart, with wait staff that seem to have had no level of training and even less coordination. The host is just a rotating wait staff member, who has a minute of downtime. There's lots of \"have you already been helped?\" and \"did you need a table?\" since you could deal with the multiple \"hosts\" before you're found a table.   Both times I've eaten at Roast, the waitstaff somehow manages to ignore all tables. If you look around it's common to see tables sitting for +10 minutes before water arrives. Did you finally get your water? Need a refill? There's a sink in the bathroom, or they sell bottled water at the 7-11 down the street. Ready to pay? Light yourself on fire - maybe someone will notice you.   It's a bar - I get that. But this reminds me more of a airport terminal grab and go that tried to turn into a State Street establishment."}
{"text":"California sandwich was great. So filling and just what I wanted.  Decent happy hour: $5 Margarita's were refreshing and as authentic as it gets outside of Mexico.  Clam chowder was one of the more different kinds that I've had but not in a bad way.  Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Must get the sweet potato fries. Cesar salad and Black and yellow sandwich are also great."}
{"text":"I really like the food here, but sometimes things aren't as good the next time you visit. Sweet potato fries here are to die for though!! I've never had bad service until tonight.  I have worked at a busy restaurant and understand how stressful it can be, but the lady tonight who served us was not friendly. She sat us without menus and we were sad that we didn't get the usual jug of water with our meal. When we asked to get refills on our waters she filled them back up for us and slammed them on the table and stormed away. Me and my friend looked at each other and was like \"did that really just happen?\"  I'll probably be back because the food is good but I'm hoping the service will be better next time!!"}
{"text":"We were recommended Roast by our friends over at the Sammy house. Fortunately we got a table quickly, but the music was TOO LOUD and we were very CHILLY. The GUAC portion was tiny but fresh. The chicken cutlet is the only reason to come back, the fries were soggy and the Mac N Cheese was not up to Wisconsin standards."}
{"text":"For what should be pretty busy Beer fest Friday and Saturday nights, l love that the place was NOT packed, so bar and booth availability came and went and the patrons that WERE there were an eclectic and spirited bunch (and that was before we arrived). And I LOVE the same qualities in their robust tap handle selection. If I lived here, this would be my kinda Madison haunt.  I only  wish we were hungry enough to even look at a menu to see if the glorious trend continues.  Next time.  Till then, 4-stars strictly on pub merits alone!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent spot for sunday brunch, since it's not as packed as some of the other places downtown. It is highly affordable and you can't go wrong with ordering either breakfast or a pulled pork sandwich! The wraps are also excellent."}
{"text":"I have to deduct a star. This shouldn't take away from the excellent beer or food selection.  Roast on a weekend--I know that State Street is filled with a ton of loud, annoying brobag undergrads, but Roast? Come on.  Hey, Roast: Did you really need to turn the music up to ear-splitting levels? Did you really need to serve the craft beer I ordered in a plastic cup? Why is a White Russian one of the saved favorite cocktails?!  Seriously...Friday night at Roast? Awful. Plastic cups for craft beer? Awful. Loud music? Awful.  Roast: You aren't Whiskey River (or whatever it's called now). You're better than that. A lot better. Stop it. Stop it now!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, slightly overpriced, close to campus.  My expectations were fairly low being how close this place is to Memorial Library, but I give Roast a high recommendation, especially in comparison to other sandwich and burger options near campus.  The brisket sandwich was a little on the small side for its hefty $9 (with fries) price tag. I understand that they're using one of the top local meat suppliers but it's about $2 too high for the serving. That said, it was delicious. Genuinely -- I'd eat it again and again. The beer braise was perfect and the meat was tender and not too fatty.   The roasted eggplant sandwich was good and quite hearty for a vegetarian serving. Fries were excellent, by far the best next to campus. Their nacho fries was huge and features fries that somehow outshined their rich toppings, which is pretty rare."}
{"text":"Very pedestrian sandwich for a high price. I could have bought a can of chicken noodle soup, grilled a breast of chicken, dressed it up and put it on wheat bread for $5 at home. At Roast $12 plus tip. The metal tray is supposed to be a cool presentation but it's emptiness is just a reminder of how little food you are getting.  It just seems that this place is trying to hard to be a hip restaurant without focusing on why people go to restaurants, which would be the food."}
{"text":"We tried to go to this place three different times and the fourth time was the charm.  Two times were on weekends, and you'll need a reservation.  This place gets packed.  The other time was between semesters and they were closed.  Finally, we had a weekday afternoon off and decided that we should go!  There weren't many people there on a random Wednesday afternoon.  Now, with all the hype and needing reservations, we assumed this place would be stellar.  It's really just ok.  There were only about 10 beers on tap.  One of them was the Duchesse de Bourgogne ($10!), which is a bit hard to find on tap.  However, the rest of the beers weren't that special, and only one of them was dark.  The rest were IPA/pale ale/hoppy stuff.    I had the 2-cheese Appleton sandwich.  Sadly, there wasn't enough cheese or apples in it.  The sweet potato fries were $2 extra and plentiful.  I got the chipotle ranch dip, which was delicious.  Luckily I had that to dip my extra bread in from my sandwich.  My partner ordered the pork sandwich with pineapple salsa.  He gave it 3.5 stars, he liked the combination of the pork with the fruit.  He was given a generous amount of kettle chips.  Service was great.  Attentive and friendly.  Worth a reservation and fighting others to find an open bar stool?  No.  Worth a Wednesday afternoon trip?  Sure."}
{"text":"Roast has a great State Street location in the thick of the hustle and bustle.  I have been there 2 times and if you're in the mood for sandwiches and beer, its your spot.  They have a plethora of sandwich choices, mostly for carnivores, but they do have a few veggie options.  The sandwiches come with chips (with an add-on $ for fries) which always kinda bugs me because who doesn't like fries more?  The choice of tap and bottled beer is extensive with an emphasis on local crafts- love it.  The prices are mid range, the decor is obvious, and I would recommend it as a solid lunch option."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Manager is a jerk. Not willing to cater to dietary restrictions. Would not go back nor do I recommend anyone go here. Food mediocre."}
{"text":"Two simple things equalling one great little hole in the wall on State - amazing sandwiches, and amazing beer selection.  This was the only place nearby with relatively affordable food where I could get my favorite craft beer this winter, and in the process, I ended up trying their breakfast sandwiches. It is, hands down, the best I've ever had. Golden, liquidy, white hot egg yolk, local sausage, and a buttery, crisp bun that had obviously been toasted on the griddle. Amazing.   Only downsides are, as it's a state street place, it can be loud and obnoxious if you go in during games on the weekend. Not a place to eat and study, to be sure, but a great place to grab a lunchtime bite. I have yet to come by in the late evening, but I imagine it's perfect for those who like better than average food with their brew, something sadly lacking on most of State."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch yesterday, around 1 PM.  Sat outside which was really nice, though I think it's harder for the servers (they have to navigate the traffic on State Street sidewalks).  According to the menu, the place prides itself on using locally sourced ingredients as much as possible, which is fantastic!  We started off with two fantastic Long Island Iced Teas (hey, we're on vacation!).  Husband had the Ode to the Paseo sandwich, which was really good.  I had the White Cap Roast Beef sandwich, which was ok.  The beef was a little tough.  The whole sandwich could use more seasoning and gravy.    Fries were phenomenal with a great seasoning, and they were HOT!"}
{"text":"Not sure what you all are thinking...just went to Roast and while the outside looked nice, it was pretty grungy inside (tables with layers of grease etc). Good beer selection, but hard to get one, because the staff were checking in with each other about how high they currently were. I was served food without cutlery or napkin. After I asked, the guy repeated the same delivery to the person next to me. Is a fork so much to ask, guys?  Food was really oily and chips tasted many days old. They must have fixed the salt issue, but I found the food not salty enough. I fear that I might have food poisoning."}
{"text":"After a campus tour of UW Madison we stopped here for a late lunch/early dinner. Our expectations were not only met, but exceeded. We each got a beer, my fiancé got the \"space cow,\" which was a mix of their Ace Space blood orange cider and spotted cow. It was delicious and refreshing. For a starter we got their cheese curds- the order size was generous and the taste was delicious. My fiancé for the French dip sandwich, the sandwich and sauce it was served with was delicious. The one thing we would change is the fries, they were homemade, a little soggy, and overall mediocre. I had the sweet potato sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. I added bacon, I wish I hadn't though, because the sandwich was perfect as is. Served on a ciabatta bun, there is a layer of blueberry jam, fresh arugula, a hearty slice of roasted sweet potato, and a generous smear of goat cheese- the bacon was just a bonus. The mac and cheese was a good size for a side and very satisfying. The prices were very reasonable as well. I can see Roast becoming one of our regular dinner destinations."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch during restaurant week.  The space is beautiful. I love the booths right by the street and the high ceilings and exposed brick really elevates this spot.  That said, I wasn't a fan of their food.  My friend and I shared their poutine as an appetizer.  I enjoyed the fries, but I found the entire poutine to be a soggy mess.  Things were congealed.  It just wasn't particularly appetizing.  Then I had their chicken bahn mi.  I feel like if you're going to call it a bahn mi, then it should be a bahn mi, or at least something that reminds me of one.  Instead, what I got was a curried chicken sandwich on french bread.  It lacked the freshness of an actual bahn mi, and instead felt heavy handed.    I would come back again for drinks since their space is great and their staff friendly.  I'm just not a fan of their food."}
{"text":"Very mediocre food. My roast beef sandwich was supposed to be piled high with meat, it wasn't. It was supposed be served with giardenara, it wasn't. The iced tea had a strange grape flavor was it good? It wasn't. My wife's salmon salad had so little flavor she used all her salad dressing on it. Was it worth the money? It wasn't. The service was fair, to poor. When I asked for my missing giardenara it took at least 5 minutes for our server to appear with a small PC cup of it.  My recommendation is to skip this place altogether."}
{"text":"who is writing the majority of these reviews? hungover college kids?  i don't get it. sure, this place was nice looking enough. nice enough to entice us to sit outside at their tables and try it out. the waiter came up fast and got us our drinks. we took a look at the menu and were like little kids on christmas. everything on PAPER sounded like the most delicious food EVER. we got three different meals. the crispy chicken caesar wrap, the giambotta, and the chicken francese. wait time wasn't too long for the food to come out. enough time to finish your first beer or two.  after taking a close look at the food that came out, i kind of lost my appetite. the \"pork shoulder\" meat on my giambotta was pretty much pure fat strips....they were not edible and tasted like perfume half the time. i kept trying to make it work with my tastebuds, but could hardly swallow a bite without wanting to spit it out. the meat was AWFUL. the rest of the stuff on the sandwich did nothing to compliment it. my sister and i traded half of our sandwiches with each other right when we got our plates and she ended up giving mine BACK to me. i don't blame her. i left almost the whole sandwich untouched. fries were ok- but annoying to have to pay a $1 extra to avoid the cheap kettle chips. KETTLE CHIPS, GAWD. i really feel like i'm going to get sick from that sandwich later.....  the chicken francese was also gross. the spinach was wilted, stringy, and soft. didn't compliment the weird looking chicken chunk they put on the sandwich. weird breading and cheap chicken. it had way too many flavors going on in the sandwich that didn't compliment each other.  the chicken ceasar wrap really had no ceasar dressing on it..and once again- the overly seasoned breading on the weird thin cheap chicken didn't help.  SIGH. i'm not a bitter diner. really.  if a place is good- i have no problem admitting to it. but when you order THREE different entrees and they're ALL REALLY BAD, i can't help but wonder what there is to like about this place?"}
{"text":"Delicious food with local ingredients. If you like restaurants that use local ingredients, Roast is more accessible than, say, Harvest. That said, their prices are a little steep. I had the sandwich special with beef mushroom soup and it was $11. The soup was awesome!  They have a decent selection of beers on tap as well as a ton in bottles. I would go here to grab a beer and an appetizer again or maybe a bowl of soup. It is not going to become a regular stop for me, but it was a nice first-time visit."}
{"text":"Roast has a nice variety of sandwiches, wraps, burgers, and salads. I have been here on several occasions and haven't had a bad meal yet! Great food! Great service! And a cool atmosphere.   I would recommend the sweet potato fries and the shiracha lime aioli is a must!   Can't go wrong with the Mac n cz!  Grateful red, California avocado, and white cap roast beef for sandwiches   Avocado corn salsa burger  Southwest chicken salad"}
{"text":"Roast is cool. The cheese curds are amazingly smooth and salty, although kinda spensy at $10 a plate. I've had the southwest salad twice, and it's safe to say it ROCKS. You get a ton of chicken and almost a whole avocado! It's filling and tasty and fab. Roast will always be a state street go-to!"}
{"text":"As a very picker eater, Roast gets me trying new things! The mac n cheese is delicious (although portions could be a little bigger) and sweet potato fries are to die for (portion is huge!). Prices are definitely steep and there is usually a wait time during dinner. Only other complaint is the temperature - the place is always so cold! Very nice option on State St."}
{"text":"There are a couple sandwich places on the campus end of State Street (Potbelly's, Subway, Jimmy John's) but you would be amiss to choose a chain over Roast.   Roast has a fairly extensive list of sandwiches as well as some tasty sides to round out the meal. I highly recommend the buffalo chicken wrap, which has a bit of a kick to it. We also tried the mac and cheese (very creamy) and the sweet potato fries (absolutely must order). We did not enjoy the dixie sandwich - the meat tasted a bit too much like soy sauce.   You order at the counter - something I actually like - and then a server will bring out your food. I do think the sandwiches are a bit pricey considering the atmosphere and food presentation. You end up paying a couple extra bucks for some of the sides like sweet potato fries, mac and cheese, regular fries, or soup/salad. The default side is chips.   I recommend stopping by Roast for lunch or dinner if you're on the campus end of State Street. It joins Mediterranean Cafe and Sunroom Cafe as one of my favorite lunch spots in the area."}
{"text":"not crazy about the sandwiches but the wings alone earn them 5 stars. BEST BUFFALO WINGS IN MADISON."}
{"text":"Was not pleased.  Been there three times.  I wasn't expecting much since it's Madison on a saturday night.    On a slow weekday afternoon the service was slow because the bartenders were talking to each other instead of the customers.  They used homophobic slurs.  It seemed like the guy hired all his frat buddies to work the place.  I try to steer people away from there."}
{"text":"PULLED PORK: was kind of fatty, not very flavorful, with some limp dick cole slaw on top :( RED & YELLOW (?): Can't remember the exact name but it was a grilled chicken avocado sandwich that was actually really good SWEET POTATO FRIES: These were on point but to be fair, I'm such a slur for sweet potato fries DOG FRIENDLY: Yep! The patio is! SERVICE: Who cares? You can't eat the service"}
{"text":"Birthday girl's choice and I won't be back. Everything was bland. I never salt a thing and was salting this food like crazy trying to coax flavor out, from the black bean, guac, and chips starter through the salads. App dips weren't full (it was lunch time) and just uninspired. Guac needs something in it - this was just like fork mashed avocado. I could go into detail about the salads but I'm leaving this where is to say the food is super bland so take your chances if you dare."}
{"text":"Great for groups good burgers curds and traditional Wisconsin fare. Great location to go out to bars after."}
{"text":"Ohhh how I wish Roast wasn't nestled into the heart of college stuff. Because other than the location, I loved it!   The name, ambiance and superb (read: incredible!) beer selection on tap and in bottle are a tad more sophisticated than your usual campus sandwich shop. But it works! Sometimes I want all that without getting fancy and spending a ton.  Also, from my one experience, I didn't get any of the \"new restaurant vibe\" that most spankin'-new places emit like toxic radiation. This crew already seemed to have a good handle on their sandwiches and beers.  If you'd like a casual but delicious dinner and a glorious craft beer on tap (i.e. New Belgium, Three Floyds, Founders), ignore your instincts and head out to State Street."}
{"text":"My sweet potato fries weren't all that good. Maybe because the expextation was too high from the previous reviews. BBQ pork in the BBQ pork sandwich was dry. My cajun brisket was pretty decent. Mac and cheese was okay. Nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"Visiting Madison, hit this gem on a recommendation from our student tour guide.   Great, clean, bar & grill.   It was crowded for a 2pm lunch. Abt 10 minute wait.   Cheese curds were a good app.  Good Wisconsin curds.  No breading.  Melts in your mouth.   A surprise hit was the spicy mozzarella sticks.  Wrapped in a fried tortilla with a bit of hot sauce inside, I've never seen Mozz sticks prepared this way.    They were really good.   The Greatful Red sandwich was delicious.  The pretzel buns were very tasty.  Better than the zesty pulled pork which was a little dry.  Might have been better on the pretzel bun.   Sweet potato fries were worth the upgrade.   The homemade kettle chips are good, but you have to like kettle chips (not so much).    Local spotted cow beer was a nice pairing.    Service was friendly and prompt, but with a heavy rain outside, we weren't quick to move and no one rushed us."}
{"text":"Sassy cow cheese curds are a must.  The California sandwich is outstanding as well.  Laid back staff ands atmosphere. Loved it"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, small uncomplicated menu and attentive servers.  Really enjoyed my meal here. Get their chicken wings, they're on point.   My salmon in my salad was over cooked, but i'll look over it because everything else had great flavor."}
{"text":"Roast Public House seems to set the bar for inventive sandwiches and food in Madison. The meats they use are house roasted and I like the wide variety of bread choices from @Madison Sour Dough. They staff there is very friendly and the vast selection of draft beer makes it a easy choice for a quick dinner. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork sandwich which was very good quality. It was a busy place for a Wednesday night, but service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but what a disappointment! The service was awful! And it appeared not to be just us. Several tables around us received wrong orders. Our order came  without the side we paid extra for and after waiting 15 minutes for it we gave up. It seems like you need to be friends with the waitstaff like the table behind us in order to get good service. The food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Restaurant Week is upon Madison once again. To start the week we decided to try Roast Public House and focus on their Restaurant Week menu.   Roast Public House should NOT be your choice for Restaurant Week. It may be a thoroughly enjoyable spot for lunch or dinner but they should abandon what they're \"not\" (a Restaurant Week restaurant) and focus on what they are (which looks to be an average State Street food and drink spot).   The drink menu is ho hum. A mix of decent draft beers and good signature cocktails. After looking at the 5 options for wine I inquired if there was a wine list or other options. I received a \"That's it\" from our server with a giggle. $8.00 cocktails it would be. Watermelon Mojito (where's the alcohol in this drink???) and the Something Awesome (let's rename this to the Really Sweet Drink With Little To No Alcohol). I kind of felt like we got the virgin styles of these \"cocktails\". Not good.   Let's move on to Restaurant Week!!! I went with the Panzanella Salad, BBQ Ribs and Grapefruit Brûlée. My wife ordered the Pretzel Sticks, Confit Chicken and Chocolate Mousse. I'll stick reviewing my food except for one plate from my wife's selection.   My Panzanella Salad was good. This is the only reason for two stars instead of one. Really solid starter plate that duped me into believing the rest of the food would be good. One other note - service has been very good so far. It helps that there were only 4 other tables occupied. My wife ordered the Pretzel Sticks. There were no \"sticks\". In fact, this was simply a frozen pretzel from Sysco or a Super Pretzel placed on a large white plate. Really???  Main course - BBQ ribs. The vegetables were good. Great mix and nicely roasted. Cornbread was bad. Dry and it pretty much fell apart after picking it up. Let's say that there was no benefit from having the cornbread on the plate. Ribs were very well cooked but there was something \"off\" with the sauce that I couldn't quite figure out. I wanted BBQ sauce. That's what I ordered. BBQ ribs. The ribs were garnished with scallions and sesame seeds. Are they Asian ribs? BBQ ribs? Asian BBQ ribs? None of the above. They are ribs with an identity crisis. Although they are cooked well and presented well they are not BBQ ribs. Let's give them a new name and describe them differently on the menu. My disappointment has passed \"brewing\".   So we're finishing up the main course. Finishing not finished and here comes dessert. We're not done eating yet but I guess it's dessert time. The server displays the chocolate mousse and asks \"who ordered the mousse?\" We didn't answer because we're trying to scoop the last of our food in to take on the new plates. So, we're asked in a Mommy Dearest voice (from a college aged server) \"WHO ordered the mousse???\" We did. Add it to the table I guess...  Dessert - Grapefruit Brûlée. I was thinking of the best three words to describe this \"dessert\" and I came up with them fairly quickly. Yuck, yuck and yuck. This was awfully horrible. It was really, really bad. Pieces of grapefruit (if I'm being too hard I'll say something nice - they were fresh and juicy) covered in sugar that was hit with the torch. There was maple syrup, salt and pink peppercorns. It all came together on a small plate and tasted like something that I never want to put in my mouth again. Ever.   As I first said, Roast Public House may be a great State Street restaurant for lunch or dinner. For Restaurant Week, the only good thing about Roast Public House was the fact that we were on State Street and close to the Union for ice cream and maybe a snack... I may give them a try for lunch or dinner sometime in the future but would never consider them again for \"something special\".  UPDATE - The owner of Roast Public House took the time to reach out to me and communicate after my review above. I think it says a lot when a restauranteur does something like this. Kudos for connecting with your customers and taking the time to open a dialogue. That effort exceeded expectations!"}
{"text":"I finally made it out for lunch at Roast last week. It was busy but not too crazy and much brighter than I imagined it in my head. We were seated at a small two-top; adequate for our food but way too cozy for our lunch meeting.   I went with the pulled pork sandwich. Delicious! The apple slaw was the perfect bright note against the roasted pork. I'm not often a fan of sweet in a savory setting but it really worked and was probably my favorite BBQ/slaw combo in a long while. My only complaint about the sandwich was that my first bite was a large chunk of fat. As mentioned, I was in a lunch meeting, so I just powered through; normally into a napkin it'd go. Blech.  Our server was great and checked in to make sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive. Service was also quick in terms of getting our food and check, a boon for a quick lunch if you're popping out of your office.   During the course of our meeting the lunch rush cleared out and we were able to move to a large booth. After my meeting buddy left I stayed to listen to a conference call and wasn't hassled for hanging around. The bartender did stop by to make sure I was good on my water and to see if I needed anything else.   Prices were reasonable and I look forward to returning to try their sweet potato sandwich."}
{"text":"To whom it may concern: They do not serve sugar-free red bull.  And while the above statement doesn't affect me in any capacity. I took great pleasure in hearing it repeated over and over and over again by the bartenders of Roast, as they hurriedly worked to serve alcoholic beverages (and one hell of a fry basket) to bar full of patrons while surrounded by walls covered in a masterfully compiled craft beer list... for a college bar, that is.   It was in this moment that I finally came to appreciate the phrase, 'with age comes wisdom'. I was older than everyone in this bar and for one of the first times in recent years, I was okay with being the grandma of the bar scene as I sipped my tastefully brewed draft beer amongst the stacks of Bud light left on the tables and otherwise tasteful and trendy decor.  Now, I told myself I wasn't going to review any of the bars I went to during Freakfest, but Roast managed to avoid the holiday hell and promote themselves in a way that seemed like it was fairly representative of what a normal night out here would be, and I appreciated the heck out of it.  Of all the many bars and businesses we went to that evening, Roast was the only one you'd find me patronizing on my own volition on a regular day... plus, (as mentioned earlier) basket-o-fries. Yes. Count me in and count me in balls deep. Fry me."}
{"text":"I went to Roast twice in one weekend while I was in Madison... it was that good! I was told to try the Turkey Spinach Dip Panini and it was absolutely delicious! The bread was crispy from the panini press and then shredded turkey was tender. The side of mac and cheese was a great addition as well. I dont think that $8 is a bad price at all for the sandwich because I know I would go to Chipotle or Potbelly and spend the same amount on my meal there. I can't wait to go back to Madison just for another sandwich at Roast."}
{"text":"Excellent food with a pleasant atmosphere.  For lunch it's a winner.  I have not experienced this place after dark."}
{"text":"The sandwiches, the service, and the concept are all great.  If they can keep this up they are going to do very, very well.  Edit:  So I think I owe it to the fantastic guys at Roast to expand on my review and explain exactly why this place is going to do so well.  In no particular order, here's what makes Roast a fantastic addition to State Street.  1. The Ingredients Apparently, most of the stuff is locally sourced.  Personally, I don't care if they fly it in by zeppelin from Timbuktu, the important thing is that the food they are serving is fresh and high quality.  And the bread... oh, God, the bread.  Let's just say it's good.  2. The Sandwiches Every single sandwich is brilliantly designed on a conceptual level.  They're all based on traditional favorites, but most have a slight twist that really brings it home.  All the ingredients make sense; none is randomly chosen.    And where lesser restauranteurs might slap all their sandwiches on the same roll, that's not the case here.  Each is perfectly paired with the right bread for the job.    Also, I have to mention the absolutely ingenious decision to include a layer of lightly friend cheddar mashed potatoes on the turkey with cranberry-jalapeno relish special last week.  Brilliant!  3. The atmosphere.  They've really done a nice job reshaping the Buffalo Wild WIngs Space.  It's more open than it has been, the color schemes are great, and the whole space is inviting.  Definitely check out the basement (you might not even realize it's there)-- it's a really fantastic lounge area with a ping-pong table.  It's awesome.  4. The service  It's incredibly consistent, especially for such a new place.  I stopped in last week and the place was packed with drunken undergrads and yet I still managed to get in and out in a few minutes with my takeout order.  It seems like they can prepare a whole order in the amount of time it takes Hawks to spoon out a bowl of chili.  5. The Owners These guys really deserve a round of applause.  They're all young guys, they're all taking a big risk, and they are all working their butts off. To top it off, they're all incredibly nice and sincere.   These guys aren't playing at being restauranteurs-- they've thought long and hard, come up with a really great concept, and are doing everything they possibly could to make it succeed.  State Street is lined with restaurants that are poorly conceived, poorly-run, badly-valued etc. etc. and yet somehow still manage to stay open.  WIth the addition of Roast, the bar has truly risen.  Thanks for bringing your incredible work to Madison, guys.  I really think you're going to make a well-deserved mint off this place."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed to say that Roast has gone pretty downhill since my last visit.  Not trying to *roast* the place here (hah), but the quality and selection of food is really lacking compared to what it used to be (which was still only pretty good, on a good day).  I recently came in to find the menu had been completely redone, with so many sandwiches taken off the menu; now there's about one vegetarian sandwich option.  The menu has shifted towards grain bowls and salads, when their whole premise used to be about having artisan sandwiches.  Seriously, if I wanted a grain bowl, I'd go to Forage.  Both restaurants are owned by the same people which has become painfully clear.  However, I tried to have an open mind about the new menu, and ordered the salmon sandwich, which was just plain unflavorful and on top of that, expensive-not a good combo, in my book.  I literally feel like the chef forgot to season the salmon filet, which was tossed upon a dry bun with no sort of sauce to make up for the dryness or lack of flavor.  Fries were OK, but even those seemed to be different than what I remember-not as crispy, and pretty bland as well.  Although I understand when restaurants try to go for a new image, the changes should be positive ones.  Unfortunately, that wasn't my experience at the \"new\" Roast, and next time I'll be sure to save my $16 meal for something actually good.  Recommendation to the owner-go back to the old menu with quality sandwiches instead of trying to hop on the health food trend.  But hey, Roast has unfortunately always been that mediocre place on State whose pricing tells you it should be good, but whose food says otherwise.  But, they've got prime real estate, so I can't foresee any changes coming anytime soon."}
{"text":"So I had the veggie burger. Nothing remarkable except the slaw which tastes close to sauerkraut and is yummy. Kind of middle of road overall for veggie burgers. Sweet potato fries were very good. The wait staff was attentive, but it was really quiet on this summer weekday. Price was fine-about what I expect. Overall a one time. There are so many choices on State Street next time I'm here I'll hit up other ones."}
{"text":"Thank You Yelp for helping me discover this hidden GEM that I will secretly refer to as ROAST House of perfectly crafted sandwiches. On my day off, I headed down to state street to give it a try. I ordered the CAP WHITE HOUSE Roast Beef Sandwich. The thing was the size of a softball and probably weighed about a pound and a half. Roast Beef, Cheese, Caramelized Onions, All on a perfectly toasted hoagie. I Tried the sweet potato fries which were out of this world. This place is a must try. I would encourage you to wear some pants that will stretch a little!"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate with this place.  We frequently go here after the Badger games because it is so close to the Kohl Center. I was really excited that they have a veggie burger, but have been disappointed each of the 3+ times I have tried it, with different toppings each time. I then moved onto trying the southwest salad, and after requesting no chicken, no to tomatoes and dressing on the side.. The salad was just awful. The dressing had spilled all over the bottom of the bowl, and apparently saying no tomatoes meant I got no avocado or black bean salsa. The sweet potato fries are very good if you eat them at the restaurant but they don't heat up well the next day. They do have a good beer selection, and I can imagine the food with meat is probably a lot better."}
{"text":"When it says goldfish cheese sticks, i think they're gonna be shaped like a fish. Nope...they use goldfish crumbs.  I got the chicken sandwich with the spinach. Its a weird, hard patty. It's salty and flat. Not something you'd expect. The sweet potato fries were dope. My husband's burger was not impressive, he didn't say much about it.  The atmosphere is very white \"bro.\""}
{"text":"Great decor.  Good selection of micro brews.  The pulled pork items are great, so is brisket.  The wings and nachos were average imop.  Wings were not fresh, tasted, and had consistency like they had been sitting for awhile.  Come here for beer and pork items.  Seems to be their strong points.  Staff was friendly and prices are fair.  I'll be in again."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed with anything I get here. The harvest salad is really good. I recommend getting chicken with it because it's a nice touch. The Mac and cheese is a good side. The breadcrumbs on top are my favorite. Friends have raved about the turkey spinach dip sandwich and all of the wraps. The people are always nice. I wish they took reservations, but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I've really liked this place every time I've gone. Great place to go if you're looking for casual bar food that's better than your typical casual bar food.  Also have a good beer selection. One thing is I would like to see more variety on the food menu."}
{"text":"Always trust the \"Yelp Loves Us\" sticker. I stumbled in this place after wondering around Madison and not being able to make a choice on food. If it wasn't for the Yelp sticker I would have walked right by it. This place is a true college spot. Most of the people were outside on the patio since it was a really pretty day. You have to order inside, and I was too exhausted to move after I sat at the bar.  Solid move!  The bartender was kind of precious, so he gets 5 stars all on his own. He plugged in my iPhone behind the bar, and had good sandwich and beer advice (Get the Octoberfest). I ended up with some roast beef sandwich bigger than me and my appetite. It was good, and my only complaint is they didn't heat the meat long enough.  Anyway stop in and trust me, or Yelp, or, the precious bartender that understands the need to recharge your device."}
{"text":"If you are looking to take that special guy friend on a man date, this is the place! Solid taps and specials? Check. Variety of gourmet sandwiches? Check. Intimate but not romantic atmosphere? Check. Rhetorical questions? Check.   Are you are looking for a new restaurant on state to explore? Try Roast and let your bromance flourish."}
{"text":"\"Coopers meets Frat House\".   The food was good, but service was lacking.  Not really clear whether there's wait service or whether you're supposed to go to the counter and just pay there. It would be nice if someone came to greet you as you arrived. I didn't get the feeling that any of the staff had worked in the service industry before- they all looked like 'someone's girlfriend' filling a shift.  One side of the pub looks like a cosy, sophisticated brick house brasserie, the other side looks like a student's bedroom wall- goodness knows what goes on in the basement where the ping pong table is...  While the food was tasty, the young staff should work on their interactions with the customers, engaging with them more to make us feel more welcome.  That being said, I'd come back for another sandwich if walking along state st."}
{"text":"The food is great here. Ownership clearly has decided to ignore customer and employee satisfaction by not staffing adequately. You have a great restaurant, treat it that way."}
{"text":"The food was underwhelming compared to the decor and aesthetics of the restaurant. The food is served on plastic plates suitable for a play set.   We ordered appetizers including wings, curds and nachos. All were mediocre. My sandwich was served on a burnt piece of bread accompanied by cold fries.   I would come here for a drink at the bar but don't expect much from the food."}
{"text":"SO MUCH LOVE HERE. I love this place to death. The cheese curds are INSANE and there are so many different sandwiches and I always get something different. I'm going to miss this place a lot when I leave Madison!"}
{"text":"Went in for brunch at noon. Party of...3 on a weekend day. Not that busy.  Right now this is some of the worst service and food on state steet.  All of my party is out First time here, not like anybody would ask us.   Seated and greeted. Ordered some drinks, soda, coffee, cocktail. The coffee was awful, it was sitting for a few hours and kinda cold. The second cup, which I had to request since nobody was going to ask for refills on their own accord apparently...(wait..is this brunch?) Was *hotter* but still bad and tasteless. Seems like they use real cheap stuff. I had to get a real cup of coffee after we left.  One person in my party thought they cocktail tasted like \"cheap rail\" and was done really poorly. That person didn't order a second drink. Not worth the 10-13$ that i'm sure it as.  Food took over thirty mins to come to the table. Bacon was chewy and in my opinion, simply gross. Eggs were bland, the toast wasn't even toasted, and the potatoes were just okay. The other people in my party did not enjoy their meals and I'm not even sure if we were asked how it was overall.  Definitely will not be back or recommend. Maybe they should focus on operating only in the evening and using higher quality products."}
{"text":"In a word, delicious.  With a changing and diverse tap list, a rustic yet eclectic look, and some seriously flavorful sandwiches, I keep going back. The bartenders are attentive and knowledgable, it's clean and well-maintained, and the food is fresh, offering up great options for every taste.  The only downfall is the usual wait time of 30-45 minutes for a table. But if you don't mind eating at the bar, it's usually just a few minutes to find a couple of empty stools. Totally fine by me.  I have to recommend the Grateful Red buffalo chicken sandwich, too. And the house chips. Fabulous."}
{"text":"Obviously I love this place; great quality food and an absolutely incredible tap list... what's not to love?"}
{"text":"I want to preface this with the \"I've only been there once\" statement.   Unfortunately, it didn't live up to what I had hoped and dreamed it would be. After a month long strict paleo diet, I dove into the grilled cheese with bacon & tomato. It was simple. Not inedible but nothing to rave about. (I heart raving about food.)   My co-workers were equally \"ok'd\". I'll give it another try but I won't go out of my way.   (As a note, I had a side salad for my side and it too, was nothing spectacular.) I think I just expect too much in Madison."}
{"text":"We can start by saying that we have been here five times and are always incredibly disappointed with roast.  The food is good, I'll give them that. The sweet potato fries are great and I do really like their burger specials.  That being said, no matter how busy or empty it is, we have never ever gotten good service. Just today we waited in line for ten minutes behind three people with open tables everywhere. Apparently it takes them ten minutes to process a to go order and they make everyone else wait.  Don't expect to get your water refilled, don't expect to get visited by wait staff during the meal. Don't expect to get visited when you're ready to pay. Get used to walking up and asking for everything.  Decor is cool and the food is great but bad service is inexcusable and continually prevents us from eating here.  Edit: have eaten here recently and gotten much better service."}
{"text":"I've visited Roast Public House twice in the past couple of months and have had mixed results.  While my Restaurant Week visit came close to attaining rarified 5 star territory, a subsequent lunch time visit fell lamentably flat.   Since I do enjoy the welcoming setting and the friendly service, I'm willing to return with hopes that the quality of the food becomes more consistent.  While the decidedly mixed Yelp reviews initially gave me pause when considering Roast as a lunch option, their enticing Restaurant Week lunch menu was too tempting to keep me away. The appetizer course, Braised Pork Belly (roasted heirloom carrots, blood orange vinaigrette, toasted cumin crème fraiche, warm baguette) got things off to a rousing start.  I could detect the unctuous pork aroma as my server approached my table with the dish. The meat had a gorgeous sear, which boosted the already luxuriant flavor of the dish and paired wonderfully with the roasted carrots. Unfortunately, the baguette was no longer warm when it arrived at my table and would have benefited from more toasting and a more generous application of the crème fraiche. Wonderfully composed and expertly executed and plated, this dish showcased of the talent of the Roast kitchen staff.   The same platitudes apply to the main course, the Roasted Pork sandwich (whiskey lime pork BBQ, maple glazed onions, ancho chili slaw on a toasted ciabatta roll). Roast did a fantastic job of optimizing the flavors from each of the sandwiches components.  The addition of the maple glazed onions were a brilliant move - creating an intoxicating interplay between the richness of the pulled pork,  the subtle sweetness of the onions and the tanginess of the slightly spicy slaw. While the generous portion of the pork was a wee bit dry, that problem was solved by the lightly dressed slaw. The satisfying ciabatta roll was the perfect foil for the rest of the sandwich, providing appreciated flavor and texture.    The homemade potato chips that came as a side deserve a separate paragraph.  Perfectly browned and seasoned, they make me want to swear off grocery store chips for life.  It takes extra effort for a restaurant to make their own chips but the results for the dining experience made it oh so worth it.   Unfortunately, Roast kind of crapped the bed with the dessert course (a blueberry rhubarb crumb bar with vanilla ice cream). It was like 50 shades of bland, under baked and lacking any crunch. They went overboard with the citrus component, but even that could not overcome the blandness of the cream cheese and flavorless vanilla ice cream.  Come on Roast, go big or go home. You offered big, bold flavors for the first two courses, why did you wimp out with a weak-ass dessert?  Weak execution also plagued my subsequent visit to Roast, as my chicken tacos (a lunch time special for $2) suffered from dry, under-seasoned meat and a bland corn tortilla that fell apart when I attempted to pick it up.  It appeared very little thought went into the composition of the dish, no attempt was made to dress up the chicken with any technique or seasoning.  The potato skins we ordered as an appetizer were under-salted and not all that memorable.   My dining companion did enjoy her Bacon Swiss burger though.   I know some of my fellow Yelpers have had less than kind words for the service they received at Roast, but I've experienced friendly, attentive service during both of my visits.  This was especially true during my Restaurant Week visit where my server checked in after each course.  I'm also a fan of Roast's rustic chic interior, with the exposed cream-colored white brick and natural wood highlights.  The use of brown as the main color theme was apropos, as it reminded me of the color of roasted meat.  While the back of the restaurant is dark, the front benefits from the natural light from the front windows facing State Street.  Overall, it is a comfortable setting for a meal or a couple of beers with friends at the bar.  While the food can vary in quality, the potential of the kitchen for inspired cuisine will draw me back from time to time."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere. If they had free wifi, I could totally see myself camping out in a corner of the dining area for an afternoon.  As a first-timer to RPH, I ordered the giambotta but chose not to switch out the side of chips. The meat was well-cooked, but it definitely did not constitute what I'd typically consider pulled pork...this was the first disappointment. Second, it was WAY, WAY too salty for my taste, and I'm not usually very sensitive to sodium. Blech. I had half my sandwich and I couldn't have anymore (it wasn't because I was full, it was because I could feel my taste buds shriveling..). Thus, RPH lands a mere three stars in my book.   I'm not willing to discount it just yet because of all the other rave reviews..but I'm sorry to say that RPH did not live up to the hype! I think I'll give RPH another go at a later date. I'm really hoping that another sandwich (or the sweet potato fries?!?!) will redeem the giambotta. Crossing my fingers!"}
{"text":"When we got to the restaurant, we were immediately sat at a table and then no one greeted us for 10 minutes. No water. No \"Hey guys, thanks for waiting. We're super swamped and it will be just a minute.\" Nothing. They were decently busy, but like I said - there was no wait and a handful of empty tables when we walked in.  The menu looked enticing and we knew what we wanted to eat and drink by the time someone greeted us. I ordered a chicken bruschetta sandwich with sweet potato fries and a side of lime aioli sauce.   Our food and beer came out very quickly once our order was placed, which was nice. The sandwich was average at best, and about halfway through the sandwich, I realized the chicken breast was probably 50% cooked. What the heck ....  I stopped eating it and had the rest tossed, but was very underwhelmed. Additionally, my fries were served with a chipotle ranch sauce, which was tasty, but not what I ordered.  Meh, I'll try something else on State St. next time."}
{"text":"Take note that I never actually ate AT the restaurant, only ordered my food to go, so my rating is for the quality/price/flavor of the food. When I lived in Madison, this place was on the regular rotation for lunch, about once every month. It never disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a handful of times, and I've always been pleased with the food and the service. However, my experience at brunch this morning was not so enjoyable. The food was excellent as per usual; I would highly recommend the \"sassy sconnie\" as it was packed with flavor. Our waitress on the other hand was complacent. When she placed things onto our table she did so aggressively and seemed hostile. She did not ask how we were doing after serving our meals, and took forever to refill my sisters bottomless mimosa. When I paid in cash and asked for my change she didn't return the correct amount to me, and in fact short-changed me. I would totally recommend giving this place a visit, but just request to have any server other than Silvia."}
{"text":"I have to confess something...  I hate eating on State St. There.  I said it.  I feel better.  I don't know what it is, I really don't. Maybe it's because when I moved here so many people warned me that it's a bit of a dump, overloaded with college chains and suggested I avoid it? Whatever the case may be it's really hard to get me excited about anything over there... except Roast. It's a little weird that you have to walk to the end of the restaurant to order, but if you can get over some of the structural things (and get over them, they just won't change) it's  amazingly good. I've worked my way through the menu and can safely say everything I've eaten has rocked... the crispy buffalo chicken wrap topping the list. Whatever you decide to get, add the sweet potato fries - they're some of the best I've eaten in Madison; hot, crispy, and deliciously fluffy on the inside. And the bbq sauce they're served with?! Don't even get me started, I would drink it if I thought nobody would look at me and judge.  Only flaw? What's with the lack of locals on tap dudes? There are some solid Midwestern beers but when it comes to the Madison specific options, there aren't many. Wah, wah."}
{"text":"Fried chees curds were decent but really greasy and I found it hard to eat very many. Kale ceaser was okay but bland. The portobello sandwich was a disaster and I sent it back. Couldn't bite or cut thru the thick sourdough crust without the contents bursting out all over the place. Was very sloppy. Whole roasted red peppers on top of portobello mushrooms made it very slippery. I get that this isn't there specialty, but take it off the menu if you can't execute it correctly. Good beer selection. Really unenthusiastic wait staff on my visit that seemed like they were awaiting execution. I could see it being a great place if they worked on a few areas. For what it's worth They did take the sandwich off my bill without me even asking that's not always the case with some places."}
{"text":"Roast is a great addition to Madison's ever growing food scene.  Good sandwiches are sort of lacking in the city, so Roast helps fill some of that void.     First off, it was a difficult decision on what to order!  Roast offers probably over 15 different sandwiches, all of which looked delicious on paper.  I finally opted for the white cap roast beef - a roast beef sandwich served on a quality baguette and topped with caramelized onions and mozzarella cheese.  The beef is also drenched in its own drippings.  Overall, I was a pleased customer, as the combo of the items complimented each other well.  The meat was, however, slightly overcooked.  All sandwiches include chips, but I paid an extra $1 for a huge serving of their hand cut fries.  The fries were super good, hot (which means fresh), and included a side of a Siracha lime aioli.  Generally, sandwiches run from $8-10.  Didn't get to slam a beer down since I had a lot of obligations.  Showing up to a meeting with my faculty from my department with the Asian flush would given them cause to revoke my diploma.  However, they do seem to have a large selection of beers.  I'll have to return at a later time!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Staff is friendly. Food is good but the menu is limited. Sandwiches are much better than the salads. When they first opened they had a ping pong table downstairs but it has sadly disappeared."}
{"text":"I have to agree with just about all the other reviews here - great food, great beer list, but not 5 stars as a little help with how the whole place works would be nice.  Better signage maybe?  Anyway, we had a turkey sandwich with brie and a cranberry relish (I think), fries, and a salad.  It was all excellent, including the fries, and the salad had a nice variety of fresh greens with dressing on the side as requested.  Overall I'll go back, although it'd be nice to have one tab - food and beer all together - instead of ordering food and then turning around to the bar and ordering beer."}
{"text":"Oooh, I love Roast Public House! A sweet spot, a little hard to find in the middle of State Street, but maybe that's why it's so cool...most tables were full but not packed and it wasn't loud at all. I liked the vibe...not commercial at all and a little bit of a cozy feel, but spacious.  My friend and I sat at the bar. The bartenders were awesome, super nice, and attentive. They even gave us Hershey kisses after our meal!   My Roasted Eggplant Napoleon sandwich was delish! My friend had the daily special sandwich which included pulled pork with some sort of bruschetta topping. She loved it! Prices are reasonable, sandwiches are big and filling, and they have daily drink specials. We got a pitcher of New Belgium seasonal beer for $9!!!  Roast has a downstairs area with ping pong, darts, and a large TV. Plenty of TVs upstairs for game watching as well. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Really good food, atmosphere, but terrible service. We did not really have a consistent waiter the entire time, and we ordered 3 soups, yet none of them ever came. However, the food is very good and their house chips are amazing!"}
{"text":"They charged 21 dollars for a pitcher of flat Guinness. The food is not bad but I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Over priced; soggy sweet potatoes fries, half the pulled pork was straight fat, and the \"apple\" slaw tasted nothing of apples. There are a lot better options to eat at in this area."}
{"text":"Nice looking place with outdoor sidewalk seating. Menu was small but did offer some healthy choices all around $10. They had a very big alcohol selection to offer with the menu. Overall would say the food was average."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese with avocado. Awesome. Service was fine. My glass was always full. Only complaint would be I sat at the bar and wouldn't have minded chatting a little but the server didn't seem to feel the same way. Otherwise friendly environment."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches and cocktails. Clearly they put a ton of thought into their menu and execute everything quite well. Sometimes the difference between a good sandwich and a great one is just the bread, that's what puts them over the top. One of the better Cuban sandwiches I've had in a while. Solid service as well."}
{"text":"This has always been a go to place for me. The place has all of the beer and food you could ever ask for. The menus get a 5 star the service is pulling it down though. They are nice servers but they are slow and not the brightest.   It's a couple of young guys owning it and it seems like they are hiring based on friendships not competency. But even lack of service can't put a negative spin on this place. I am obsessed with their beef brisket. And don't forget the sweet potato fries. I'm salivating just thinking about it."}
{"text":"ARE YOU OUT OF CHEESE?!?  THIS IS WISCONSIN!!!    Ordered the chicken nachos thinking they sounded delicious...I was wrong. I ordered them without lettuce and olives (my girlfriend is allergic to olives) and went to pick them up ten minutes later. Got home, opened the box, and BOOM olives. No big deal these things happen, but after looking closer there was two chunks of tiny chicken, barely any cheese, and cold. I called the guy at the checkout (Adam was his name) and explained to him what was going on(he was kind and took the ticket correct) he handed the phone over to his manager Spencer who seemed very short and not to happy to talk to me. (Mute the phone when handing it over cause we can here ya, brah)       Yada yada ya they replaced the nachos. I Pick them up, get home, open box and the nachos still suck. No cheese, bland dry chicken, cold, and one big piece of lettuce mixed in I feel just to spite my complaint.        I was super excited to finally try out roast and was severely let done...twice.  This is clearly \"nacho\" thang. I'll be going to brick house bbq for my nachos from here on out."}
{"text":"We are visiting Madison and were excited to try this very crowded and popular place. We waited about 30 minutes, no problem. Staff is friendly and the cheese curds were delicious. The burgers were unfortunately terrible. We ordered 2 medium rare and you could tell that the patties were probably cooked in the morning and were extremely over cooked and barely edible. Disappointed..."}
{"text":"Food is great, service is lacking. I've been going to Roast every now and then over the past few years, and I've come to terms with the fact that their service is very hit or miss.   I was super bummed on my last visit - a friend and I were there for brunch, and the only people in the restaurant. Our waiter was friendly, but didn't write down either of our food orders. Usually I don't mind this, but once he got to entering them in a few minutes later, he had to call over and ask my friend which of the scrambles she ordered. And when our food was brought out, I noticed immediately that I did not get what I ordered. I felt bad saying anything because I didn't want to make them rush to remake something, and I didn't want to make my friend wait to eat, so I just ate what he brought. But that was really disappointing. At least my friend got the right scramble!  If their service was just a little better I think I would definitely visit Roast more often, because I really do like their food! They seem to have changed up their menu quite a bit over the past year or so -- they used to have mainly sandwiches where they were split up on the menu by the type of meat they were made with -- beef, pork, and poultry. Now they've moved to less sandwich options but other options, like bowls and salads. Thankfully they kept those Sweet Potato Fries on there -- because wow those are up there among my favorite sweet potato fries ever (DLUX has good ones as well)!! They're more shaped like traditional chips, flatter and just a bit wider, and when you get the chipotle ranch on the side... oh man they are SO GOOD!   I like how at Roast you can switch up your order and turn a sandwich into a wrap or vice versa! I really liked doing that with items on their old menu, but a lot of those items are sadly gone. However I'm eager to try some of the new menu items, like the Pigs Fly and Supper Club bowls and the Guacamelt.   I know I'll be returning to Roast (and ordering sweet potato fries, obviously), but with a little more hesitance now due to their unreliable/inconsistent service."}
{"text":"This place was great, definitely worth checking out on a game day or hitting up if one of the nicer places downtown has a long wait.  I went for brunch with a friend on a Sunday to catch the beginning of some NFL games. The space is bright and open, but lacking in some areas that could easily be improved. The bar: impeccable. The awkward space between the bar and dining room that has random wires/storage sticking out: not so much.  As far as drinks/brews go, they had a pretty nice selection and I enjoyed the Oberon I got. My friend got a Bloody Mary, which he said was also pretty good.  The selection of breakfast items was a bit weak, as it seemed most of them were just different combinations of the same 5 items, but my egg sandwich with avocado was really good when it came out. I was impressed that they had the veggie options they did with a name like \"Roast.\"  I would definitely go back but wouldn't put it high on the list. Fun for a quick lunch or dinner before hitting the town."}
{"text":"The Roast is a nice place in State Street to get a better meal than your average sandwich.  They have a good variety of food, but the wait can sometimes be long.  The food itself is pretty good, but I have had better in Madison."}
{"text":"Roast has a great variety of delicious sandwiches and wraps.   Every sandwich I've tried has been very good.  The sauces are also very good...zesty lime aioli, imperial stout BBQ...YUM.    The sweet potato fries are awesome.  They are a thicker cut fry with a crispy outside and a soft inside. I would definitely recommend.  The service is OK, but not great.  I've had better luck with service when I sit at the bar, so I tend to grab a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"We stopped in this place on a Saturday and saw that you order at the counter, so we grabbed a couple of menus and started deciding on what we wanted.  While we were looking, an employee stopped by to ask if we had been there before and if we knew how it worked.  Appreciated that he made sure we knew what we were doing, instead of letting us fumble blindly through the experience.  I ordered the Jersey Joe - turkey, roast beef, Swiss and coleslaw on a marble rye with a Russian dressing/sauce on the side.  My partner got the Cuban.  Sandwiches come with chips and we ordered a side of fries to share.  The sandwiches were HUGE and great!  They were both piled high with meat, and the meat was tender and delicious!  The fries were not for me, they were the hand cut type, but I am more a fan of the McDonald's french fry...crisp and golden.  Just personal preference, and I always try to sample the fries where we eat.  They have a huge beer selection, and surprisingly, some of the best iced tea I have had in a long time!  We will definitely go back and try another sandwich, since there are many to choose from.  There are also salads and some appetizers.  The staff were all friendly and efficient, no complaints there.  Great place to grab lunch if you are on State St."}
{"text":"Having gotten food-poisoning from Jimmy John's on State St. and undercooked chicken from the Chipotle, I am very careful about where I'll eat near campus; I never worry about Roast!  Their beer-list and menu are thoughtfully crafted and their atmosphere is warm and inviting with a touch of shabby-chic.  They generally offer pub fare with an innovative twist that rarely disappoints.  The disadvantages, however, are that around 10:00 on Thursday (perhaps Friday as well?) they try to turn themselves into a dance club, rendering all conversation impossible.  Furthermore, they are a little pricey for the amount of food you get, thoughtfully prepared though it may be..."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now, mainly for brunch, but also dinner.   Brunch is amazing. Every time I have been in for brunch I have been able to get a seat right away. Service has been great. And the food, SO GOOD. I am a huge mimosa fan, so the bottomless mimosa is pretty great. $15 is a little steep, though, I must say.   Dinner was great, too! They have a \"breakfast all day\" sandwich (can you sense a theme here? I am a breakfast food kinda girl). I have had this twice now. I really, really enjoy it. They allow you to sub for avocado if you prefer at no extra charge which is nice.   I am docking one star just because on one occasion that I was there, a friend who I was dining with had to send their meal back as it came out cold. They fixed the mistake, but by the time the hot food came back, everyone else was nearly finished. I'm sure it was just a fluke. I will still continue to eat here for sure."}
