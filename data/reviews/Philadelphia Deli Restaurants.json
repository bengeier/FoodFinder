{"text":"Great food! Best Phili Cheese Steak I've had anywhere but Phili! Fries were cooked perfect too.   Service was just fine, they are polite and cordial, and asked me to please come back.   I've seen negative reviews but I call BS on most of them. To many times I've seen people refuse to eat somewhere and then slander the place based on appearance alone. I get it, it's a hole in the wall/dive. Typically where the best grub is in my experiences!   Don't worry about the look of the building, go in, say hello, order something epic, and enjoy. Because you certainly will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I've been driving past this restaurant for awhile now but finally decided to go inside (and I'm happy I did)! Sure the outside isn't that appealing (and neither is the inside) but that's part of its charm. I went on a Saturday morning with a few friends. Three of us got omelettes (the Philly and Greek ones were delicious) which were awesome and one of the guys got a Philly cheesesteak and said it was great too. I have come to learn that Greeks know how to cook a darn great breakfast and this place just proved it even further. Go here and support a local business!"}
{"text":"Went here as an alternative to the hospital cafe. Wow, the building is scary looking from the outside but we already had the walk invested so we went in. I got a cup of coffee to warm up. I have to say that this has to have been one of the worst cups I've every had. Makes a circle k cup upscale by comparison. We all had the cheese steak which was touted as original philly. We heard so much about the best cheese steak wars in Philly, we actually went there for four days to settle it for ourselves ( Tony Luke's btw), so we have some idea of \"original\" philly. These were terrible. See pics. Steak-ems at best, canned mushroom, peppers, and the cheapest cheese you can buy and it still pass FDA standard. I couldn't eat it. I ate the crinkle fries, fresh cut, frozen shipped from wherever for direct distribution through Sam's club. The hot sauce was in Texas Pete as well as other Brand's bottle filled with white vinegar and hot sauce mix. Looked watered down until further inspection revealed the vinegar. Now the owner/servers look as if they may be from philly! Best thing about the place was the owner (mom maybe in her 70's) had the heat up and it was warm in there. I was told by a nurse the place has looked the same for 30 years with zero upkeep. The real estate being dead smack in the medical district has to be worth 1000 times more than this place can produce in a year's time. Think the boys may be hanging in there out of respect for mom since they didn't seem very enthused to be in the restaurant business. They may be just waiting to have a real estate auction some day soon then retire to a beach somewhere. I feel terrible saying to steer clear of this place as I'm assuming it's her life, but maybe it will help the boys escape"}
{"text":"Only been here once. I only tried their breakfast sandwiches (egg/bacon on rye & egg on rye). The egg/bacon was actually pretty good, straight egg/bacon, nothing else inside. Nice and fatty and is filling.   This place is definitely no fancy hip breakfast place, more like a dingy outdated diner, but somehow it really has character. Kind of like a museum exhibit of an old diner or something. And that's what I liked about this place. The old lady working there was SUPER nice. I'm assuming this is a mom and pop shop. I really liked the old lady working there. Not that the service was extraordinary or anything. Just one of those shops that makes you want to support them and wish them to do well.  Oh, I should also mention, the prices are extremely reasonable. Like, price hasn't changed in 20 years kind of cheap. I'd much rather go here than McDonald's for breakfast."}
{"text":"Philadelphia Diner (my name for it) is a throwback's throwback, in all the right ways.  Convenient, inexpensive, family owned, good food, fast service, good people....unfortunately places like this are a dying breed -- long live the Phildelphia Diner!  Alice and her 2 sons are just good folks.  Mr. Drosinis passed away last Christmas Eve (RIP) but the rest of the family soldiers on...and in good fashion no less.    I only go here for breakfast and it's always good.  When I order 3 eggs over-medium, invariably I am served 4...and seems like there's always an extra piece of bacon too.  The coffee isn't the best I've ever had, but it's coffee.  Grits are a large portion and the toast is good!  These are good folks, please support them.  PS....I am loath to call out another reviewer but the review below by Wes G. includes a lot of false information, including the health score and the comments about smoking.  The Philadelphia has an A rating with a score in the 90's, and no smoking is allowed...shame on you Wes G."}
{"text":"Basic diner with good food and no frills. My husband had the breakfast sandwich with ham, egg, cheese which he enjoyed . I had the toast which was made with Texas toast and very good. Home fries were seasoned well but would prefer they had been a little more crispy and cooked longer. Decor is dated but has charming character."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim just was in the area and was looking for a quick breakfast.  I will say like others have said the look of this place won't sell you at all so don't let that stop you from giving it a try. This was my first time coming in so I had no real expectations.  It wasn't packed at all so I didn't know if that was a good or bad thing but people started to roll in as we sat down and placed orders.  The staff is very friendly and seems like the place where they treat everyone like regulars.  So we ordered it only took about 10 mins for the food to come out. I got a pancake breakfast with bacon and eggs it was good! Idk what type of bacon they use but it sure is good. My girl had an omelette which she enjoyed. If you are looking for some place not super expensive and good food check this place out. I would try it often if it was on my side of town but I would recommend if you are at the hospital and looking for a nice quick lunch or breakfast"}
{"text":"It is what it is... Looks old from the outside and appears even older when you walk in.  Dropped ceiling, musty, strange decor, and wood paneling.  Almost walked out we were the only 2 people there at 1PM on a Tuesday, but after seeing that a Philly steak sandwich was only $5 and it came with fries, had to give it a shot.   It wasn't a Philly steak sandwich but it was edible and the pulled pork seemed ok.  Bread was awful, probably stale as it was toasted.  Fries were good and service was very friendly.  For a quick bite on the cheap tip, I'd say go for it."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, very friendly service! A great place for lunch, they make a mean Philly cheesesteak, and have breakfast all day!"}
{"text":"Don't let the  modest appearance have you not taste some amazing food and great prices. The owners have run the restaurant since the 70's and offer excellent diner food and great sandwiches. I highly recommend the Reuben or any of their subs. The meats and veggies are always tasty and this time of year they make delicious soups. They make great fried squash if you are lucky enough to have it on the menu when you come.They make a great Greek Salad with their homemade Greek Dressing. You can get breakfast all day. They bake their own cakes and baklava. They are generous on the proportions."}
{"text":"Like Chad said, if you are in the hospital or just getting out, it works, but otherwise I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.  I had just gotten out of a 3 day stay in the hospital across the street where they forgot to tell the people in charge of food that I was only on the liquids diet for the first 2 days.  I WAS HUNGRY!  I walked in to see that me and my mom were the only people there.  A nice lady at the counter told me to seat myself.  I asked for a coffee and it came relatively quickly.  My and my mom both ordered your pretty much run of the meal breakfast, 2 eggs, choice of meat, choice of bread.  I ordered my eggs over medium, they came out borderline hardboiled.  The meat was edible but nothing worth noting.  Our waitress was prompt to refill the coffee throughout the meal.  Then it came time for the check.  Not sure what happened here.  We waited on the check and it never came, when I finally saw the waitress again, she said you pay up front(I assumed that, I just thought I needed a check to give them first).  I went up the register and the other person working there asked where my check was, we were the only people there, it can't be that hard.  After the cook/cashier found the hostess/waitress we were rung up and on our way.  Relatively cheap, but nothing special, worth the drive elsewhere."}
{"text":"What a great diner and a fabulous find! 4 of us came here yesterday after taking care of some business at the medical center and you better come here with an appetite - because the proportions are healthy! Everything is made from scratch here. We had meatloaf, meatball sub, a Reuben sandwich and one guy had a slice of chocolate cake ala mode - which would have been 2 slices anywhere else - it was huge. Prices are great and I saw one review that lamented the decor and suggested they put some money there. Buddy, of they did that the prices would go up and the portions would decrease. Mom opened this business 41 years ago and still works there - it's a family affair - and I for one will come back here again and again."}
{"text":"The decor makes it obvious this place has been open since the early '70's but the nice thing about it is they aren't pretentious enough to change anything.    Service is steady and friendly.  It's pretty quiet in the evenings because their main rushes are breakfast and lunch.  But they're open late compared to the higher end (and snobbier) restaurants nearby that close mid-afternoon.  The BLT Club is good, the french fries are always hot and soda refills are free.  They also have a standard selection of bottled brews."}
{"text":"the food is okay and the prices are really inexpensive. the staff and the vibe is peculiar and charming"}
{"text":"After passing this little place for years  I stopped for a late breakfast.  I was starved after a 12-hour fast for blood work at CMC across the street.  There is little to draw you in, but once inside the staff was friendly and efficient--I like that.  Prices are dirt low and the food is basic diner fare.  My low score comes simply from a lack of investment into the property.   It needs a lot of TLC and one wonders if the owner is waiting for the hospital to buy him out.  Location is killer, ample parking, credit cards accepted, and you can be in/out in under 30 mins.  The diner game in the QC is competitive; Philadelphia is getting clobbered by its peers."}
{"text":"Like others have said, it's decent food at inexpensive prices. Typical Greek family run place like many others in Charlotte. I had the Philly Cheesesteak, and it was a far cry from an authentic version. But it was decent. Fries were good. Older waitress wad attentive and nice. Decor was horrible. Table was \"sticky.\" If this place invested just a few hundred bucks it would make a world of difference!"}
{"text":"This restaurant provided a good hearty meal.  The food was tasty and the proportions were large.  If you are looking for a fancy restaurant, then you will not enjoy this establishment. I enjoyed the nice staff and good meal.  You can not beat the prices either.  It is a good place to visit if you are visiting loved ones at the hospital across the street or if you are a healthcare worker and need a break from the hospital, you can't go wrong here with their hearty meals and prices."}
{"text":"Don't judge the book by its cover as the interior and exterior is a wee bit outdated. The food was very reasonably price and plentiful."}
{"text":"Nice family owned spot that serves breakfast and a variety of  american and greek/italian foods all day. Very cheap as well and good tasting! Fast service as well."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and love it. It's a hole in the wall spot with cheap & hearty meals.   I've had breakfast here and the amount of food they give you is awesome. Served on huge plates containing eggs, protein, hash browns and a ton of toast. Plus, they serve livermush, if you grew up liking that sort of thing :)   Also tried their steak sandwich and loved that too.   The service is average as well. They take your order and leave you alone till you need something, which I prefer. Everyone here working is nice.   Sure, it's definitely not the prettiest place to eat in Charlotte, but if you're ballin on a budget and want a big satisfying meal, come here to eat."}
{"text":"Nothing about this place should surprise you, particularly a fast basic breakfast for about $4-5. If you have to go to the carolinas medical center but want a quick breakfast beforehand this is probably the best (or only) reason to go here."}
{"text":"Philadelphia Deli Restaurant is your classic mom and pop deli. Nothing fancy but good prices, plentiful amounts of food, and great service.   I stopped by here to continue my Reuben adventure around charlotte. I hadn't looked closely enough at the menu - for $6.95 I got a double decker Reuben and a side. I had only expected to get a single decker? sandwich. It was huge - far more food than I needed for lunch (although I'm me and still managed to eat it).   The Reuben itself was fairly average. Corned beef was pretty standard although lacking in flavor a bit. The cheese said Swiss on the menu but I don't think it was - seemed more like American, led to a creamy type taste that you wouldn't expect from a Reuben. The kraut was also lackluster. However, the bread was a good seeded rye with an absolutely perfect crisp and the proportions were spot on. In the end it was about what I expected from a mom and pop deli.   If you're looking for a good bargain on an ok Reuben with great service while you're there, Philadelphia Deli Restaurant is worth checking out. If you're looking to find the best Reuben in Charlotte, there are other spots to check out."}
{"text":"If you're at the hospital and want something other than hospital food, this place may be the ticket.  Right across the street, you can get a good variety of food.  It's quick and easy and not too expensive.  Just don't go for the atmosphere because, well, there isn't much.  But keep your head down and that won't matter much."}
{"text":"Having grown up in Charlotte is surprising I've never been here. I've been missing out! They have a huge menu of good ole home cookin and Greek style food. I keep ordering the Philly cheesesteak it's so good! For the price and the amount of food you get, this is my new go to place!! Oh and your food comes out piping HOT! I can't wait to try other things on the menu and breakfast!"}
{"text":"A old school Greek diner with great food and very reasonable prices. They have a wide variety of subs, pitas, and other meals."}
{"text":"Sorry to see it go...   wish they got more money on the sale...  I think they were snookered....."}
{"text":"Not sure I will be coming back here ever.  Yuck all around.  I Dare say McDonalds might be better."}
{"text":"Service was very good but i must say, the decor is a real turn off. If i wasn't feeling adventurous i may have walked right back out the door. I ordered two pancakes,eggs, sausage, and grits. They weren't the best I've ever had but were adequate. My wife had the philly steak and cheese. She thought it was \"ok\". She actually needed to add salt. Even though it wasn't top notch chow, i am glad i came because nothing beats trying new places in your city."}
{"text":"I pass by this every day on my way to work and always have pondered going in.  My brother and I were hungover this morning and in the mood for a greasy spoon.  The moment you walk in the door you're greeted by the family I assume owns and operates the place.  After walking through the sons cloud of smoke and dodging the fathers rude snarling stare you're smacked in the face with a musty mildew smell.  You expect a place like this to have an old time feel with decor, but not like it hasn't been cleaned since 1969.  Okay, they're in business because the food is bananas good and people keep coming back to keep the place alive, right?!?!?!   Wrong!!!  I had a double cheeseburger.  The fries were stale and tasted freezer burnt.  The burger was a hot mess and tasted off.  I've been feeling ill since I left.  The mother was extremely rude and particular unhelpful. Now every time I pass I'll not ponder what if, but how the hell is this place still open...  87 health score."}
{"text":"Passed by this place on my runs forever and finally decided to stop in.  Food was excellent and very reasonably priced.  The potatoes were great and the omelet was fantastic.  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Lots of food for a little price. Place is scary looking but food was good. Classic place."}
