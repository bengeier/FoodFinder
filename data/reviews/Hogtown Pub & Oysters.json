{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend On a Sunday afternoon, I had the best server ever Christine!!! And the food and atmosphere was absolutely amazing!!!! This my favorite place to come and hang out :)"}
{"text":"Had bad service from one of the older waitresses. Wanted to combine two items of different prices but still have separate bills, and she gave me the dirtest stink eye. (Ended up with a combined bill.)   Also, the mussels were not very fresh, had a slight funk to them, but I didn't die eating them. The white wine sauce was light.  Nice atmosphere to watch Canada lose the men's 4 by 100m relay race sigh"}
{"text":"Great gourmet pub.  I feel like they have the best fish and chips in the city.  Amazing poutine as well.  It is a great casual dining experience.  Love it here."}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight and sat on their brand new patio! It's a small space (one 3-seater table) but it's lovely. We ordered fajitas because they were 2 for 1 (Tuesdays), had a couple pints each, and enjoyed the view of College Street.   They also have a daily fish taco special. One lucky night they were octopus tacos, 3 for $10, and they were incredible. So tender, perfectly seasoned, slightly spicy but not overwhelming. I raved about them for so long the guy at the table next to us ordered them as well.  Anything not on special is a little pricey but the food is delicious and the service is great. This is somewhere I'd take my parents when they come for a visit, or a group of friends before a night out, or a date for a romantic meal with live music."}
{"text":"Have been there twice. The atmosphere, music, tucked in tv (playing sports) is all fantastic.  The food is great. The oysters are delicious. Must have the burbon wings (extremely hot). YumO! The staff are non stop and extremely attentive. A must visit!"}
{"text":"Wandered into this cozy bar on a Wednesday, where they have half priced pulled pork nachos if you get a pitcher. The underwhelming oyster selection (3 types)  wasn't what I expected from a place with \"oyster\" in its name.   We only had a few oysters, which seemed to be a bit pricy in comparison with other oyster bars in Toronto. Also had the truffle tater tots, which were delicious. I would recommend ordering from their daily menu on the chalkboard instead of the normal menus. The portions were very generous and the staff was very courteous. Overall, I would say that Hogtown Pub and Oysters is a great place to hang out with friends and enjoy a beer, but there are better places for oysters."}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday with a friend for dinner. Lighting was dim and remiscent of candle light. Servers were all very friendly and enthusiastic. The atmosphere and vibe seemed casual, laid back, chill and had an old tavern, country look to it with string lights and wooden accents.   I ordered the black and blue burger ($12.50) which comes with sides such as salad/fries/etc at an extra cost. To my own negligence, I was a bit disappointed my burger didnt come with fries but realized after that I had to order them. Nonetheless, my burger was very juicy and filling. Definitely not first date food as things will get messy but sooo good! The patty was a bit too salty for my liking but the blue cheese chunks and caramelized onions balanced the burger very nicely. I also ordered 9 oysters ($3/each) from BC and PEI but they had a deal for a dozen at $30 that day. The mignonette tasted fantastic and the oysters although on the small side were very delicious and fresh.   Overall, I liked the ambience of the place and how friendly and comfortable it felt. Looking forward to $1.50 oysters on Mondays and Thursdays!"}
{"text":"A nice casual local pub in the heart of Little Italy with decent food offerings and good varied selection of beers including many local craft beers.  Service was friendly and quite attentive, but not overbearing.  Since it was a slow night, servers were able to chat more than usual which I don't normally mind. Definitely a place for service with a smile and the comfort of a local friendly pub.  Menu prices are quite reasonable with portion sizes a bit on the small scale, but daily menu specials are probably the best bet.  Probably not the best tasting food I had, but for a pub, it works great for me.  Daily tacos 3 for $10, oysters galore ($1.50 each on Thursday) and they have drink specials as well, just look at the blackboard or wait until a server informs you.  If you want a no fuss type of place with a variety of food selections and beer choices, then this place is for you.  Bonus if you love oysters because they're not too bad."}
{"text":"Fantastic vibe, really good cocktails, the bartender came upto to take my cocktail requests. The chicken wings are huge n so yumm. What a fun place to hangout!!"}
{"text":"Service is good - friendly, reliable. However, the place is not a good value - quality-quantity-price do not balance.  $7 for a bowl of taco chips and a spoonful of bad guacamole. Been here several times because of the location but the sticker shock is not justified by what we get. Too bad."}
{"text":"I had a very nice and casual dining experience here yesterday.  Love the dark pub atmosphere and the restaurant is very thoughtfully decorated.  A decent selection of local beers on tap, and the chalkboard menu of specials was fab!  We started w the octopus appetizer.  Good thing we only ordered 1 app because it was a huge serving and came with sides (fingerling potatoes and spring mix).  Very yummy, although wished it was a bit more charred.  For the entree, I got the Arctic char fish with butternut squash purée and asparagus, which was a chalkboard menu special, and it was simply perfect!  My fish was tender, while the outside was crispy!  Loved it!  My boyfriend had the duck breast and it was good too although he wasn't a fan of the apricot purée (think it's just his personal preference).  We were too full to have any dessert, but the selection looked yummy.   Prices are very reasonable, and our server was very attentive and friendly.  Overall - fantastic experience.  Would come again!!"}
{"text":"The friendliness of everyone we have meet is beyond Hoosiers so far. And Poutine! I'm sold."}
{"text":"My friend and I were walking around on a rainy Tuesday night looking for beers. We stumbled upon Hogtown and were not disappointed. $2.50 tacos (favourites being spicy octopus & pulled pork). The service was amazing. Christine, our server, was friendly and attentive! Beers were decently priced. I would definitely recommend taking advantage of one of their nightly specials!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went there for a drink to cool down on a very hot day. We didn't order any food, but the Sevice there was amazing!! The waitresses were nice! And the atmosphere was great! Our waitress stopped me from ordering a beer and asked if I like them hoppy, but I don't! So I'm very glad she asked me! They all knew their menu inside and out. Very impressed !"}
{"text":"Too hyped. Not really a seafood spot. Seafood was overpriced and not that good. Staff was somewhat friendly"}
{"text":"I ended up at Hogtown Pub & Oysters randomly on a Friday night to celebrate my birthday. The original plan was for everyone to meet at NightOwl but because of how crowded and loud it was, I decided to scout out nearby places in -30C, and stopped by this gem!   The host was very quick to set us up for a table of 15 without any problems at all. The wait staff was super friendly, patient, and professional! I seriously haven't experienced this kind of service in a while. Our waitress even split our bills in the end, which I understand can be a headache with big groups.  I ordered Oysters and they were pretty great. I enjoyed the West Coast oysters more than the East Coast ones. Their fish tacos are a pretty great appetizer too.  The atmosphere is very cozy, with beautiful twinkling ceiling lights, small booths for if you're on a romantic date, and a bar in the back.  If you're in Little Italy, definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best way to cap off our trip to Toronto!! Chrissy was such a joy to have as our waitress and made our evening! Also the food and drinks were delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I have always had friendly service here. It is a great neighbourhood spot with a great interior perfect for a casual drink and appy."}
{"text":"I wish I was able to say something positive.  My story...well on their actual website, I clicked the reserve button.  I was so happy to see that I was able to reserve on boxing day, my birthday.  So I reserved a table and received a confirmation number.  My husband and I got ready, took a cab ride and ended standing in the rain outside a closed restaurant. Thanks so much for nothing....well we ending running in the rain and had a great dinner at Vivoli.  Thanks Vivoli for a great dinner and beautiful dinning experience."}
{"text":"Currently at the Hogtown pub, everyone is super friendly/chills and nice. Perfect atmosphere. The bartender comes over and he is so nice, made us the best drinks, exactly how we like them!! We ordered our chicken wings/drummies a little obscure as to how they normally do them, but they joked with us and ended up accommodating us amazingly. The crispest chicken wings i have ever had. I will bring anyone who complains about \"not well done enough\" chicken wings here; (aka my dad lol). Then we each had an amazing AAA burger with the crispiest most beautifully presented onion rings. Im very picky about garlic aioli and it was wonderful.. Amazing and fast service, so friendly and relatable; Im definitely going to reccomend this place to everyone. Please everyone try it!  A+!!!"}
{"text":"Easy to get a table on a Friday night with great service. We ordered the fish and chips, which was pretty good - beer batter was crunchy and inside was moist and tender, not too greasy for my taste. Also got the grilled salmon off their daily menu, which was alright, nothing amazing but I still finished my plate. Pitcher of white sangria was tasteful and surprisingly very big, but I would say it's more of a day drink than for dinner."}
{"text":"Hogtown on College is a great pub.  My friend and I ordered a burger and the bacon mac and cheese.  Both were good portions and tasted good.  The beer selection is ok as well.  I've yet to sample oysters but I've heard they're tasty here.  The server was a friendly, attentive guy who gave recommendations and seemed to really enjoy his job.  I would definitely visit Hogtown again if I'm in the area.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Update on my review! I went back with another friend and the server, Christine I believe was fantastic! Same lady that served us the 1st time. I could not believe she remembered me. The place gets busy, she must see a million faces! She clearly loves her job and the patrons that visit. Service is always on point. Love the vibe here. Food and the wine pour are great! I only wish I lived closer.  Review #1   My friend and I went here last night, and loved it! Great vibe and the girls that worked there were super friendly and service was great!  Had the Salmon with Arugula salad. Delish!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a Friday night...basically I was meeting friends nearby and did not want to hang out in the cold.  It was fairly quite but in all fairness it was early (6 30) on a Friday night. I settled at the bar and was greeted by a very welcoming and friendly bar tender. I decided to have a scotch and they have enough of a choice that I was not disappointed (if you want a huge variety then visit the Caledonian which is further along College near Ossington).  The scotch was served to my request (upon asking). I then decided to try some oysters; I had six and it cost $18 which was pricey compared to other places. Oysters  came with the usual enhancers such as lemon, horseradish and Tabasco.   The bar is warm and inviting and meals being served looked good. You can see in to the kitchen; which I quite like.  The bar tended advised me it is $1.50 oysters on a Thursday night.   Will certainly return!"}
{"text":"Fish Taco was amazing! It's salmon on Saturday, really well cooked.  A dozen of oyster using a coupon cost $25. Well, price is quite fair, oysters tasted pretty good. Though I'm still in love with the oysters I tried in Montreal.  Chicken Nachos didn't impress me a lot, but it's okay."}
{"text":"We had a really great lunch here on a Sunday. Let me just say that Hillary, the bartender was AWESOME. We were visiting from LA and were the first ones at the bar when the restaurant opened. I found it on yelp and was excited to see that it was in a lively area of Toronto with lots of places to walk to! Hillary chatted with us and gave us a bunch of ideas on where to go and what to see.. she was hilarious. Sometimes a person can make your whole dining experience, and she definitely did so for us. She told us all about the different beers on tap and where they are from, and even let us taste any we were interested in. She also revealed to us her mad hate for the Toronto street cars even though she uses them often. ;) hahaha she was a riot.     Ok ok I'll get to the food... it was fantastic!! I was craving oysters so when I found this place I was super stoked! We ordered a dozen oysters which came with some amazing home made sauces for them. The vinegar (red one) was sooo good I wanted to steal it! The other one was a lime ginger sauce which was so unique and original, I had never had anything like it with oysters before! Yum!!! Oysters were fresh and tasty. Then we ordered their grilled squid appetizer and the pork belly mac and cheese to share. The squid was amazing!! What a well put together dish with flavors that compliment and elevate each other! The mac and cheese was good but I would have called it Mac and Cheese with Park Belly bits rather then Pork belly Mac and Cheese.. the pork belly was an afterthought in this dish. It had a thin crispy pork belly slice on top, but it was more bacon then the standard thick melt in your mouth pork belly I imagined. Still delicious AF.. I was just craving more pork belly! We washed it all down with a few different beers that Hillary recommended.    The decor of the place is super cute! I loved the twinkle lights on the ceiling and the warm, homey atmosphere. I wish we could have stayed for trivia that night! I bet Hillary would have made it super funny. The other blonde bartender was sweet too, she came in as we were leaving so we didn't catch her name.   We had a great time here and next time we are in Toronto, we will for sure stop in for some great food and conversation."}
{"text":"Had an absolute blast there for my birthday last Friday.  All of the staff were incredible, the food was amazing and the environment was super laid back, but really, really lovely. Great for a small to medium-sized group.  Try the oysters!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but the ambiance is pretty old and staid. if that is what you are looking for then cool. Otherwise I would say it is a pub that fun forgot. The pub is a bit uptight."}
{"text":"My first time visiting since this was the second location of the Auld Spot Pub. So it's been a few years and the name has changed, but everything else looked pretty much as I remember it. Literally the booths, the wall art, and the beer options, all seem very reminiscent of what I remember it to be under its previous name.  Beer selection is a bit laclustre (big brands and European heavy choices, save for a few Mill St choices and Junction Brewings Conductors Ale) but averagely priced in the expected $7-$8 realm. Comparatively, $9.50 for a glass of wine seems extreme, but it is a 6.5oz glass so at least its a bit larger than the usual 5-6 oz.  Food wise, everything is under $20 unless you upsize the steak size of the steak frites. I had a pulled pork sandwich that I did enjoy thoroughly. I'd say its snuck its way into my 10 Pulled Pork Sandwiches in the city.  In the end, its not the most exciting menu or dining experience, but its a safe bet and will give it the same rating I did years ago under its former name. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely Friday evening here with my mom after a long work week. We had decided we wanted to go somewhere casual with seafood on the menu and Hogtown came up in my Yelp search : )  The night we visited they were offering a lobster boil meal for $50 which included a whole lobster, corn on the cob, herb roasted potatoes and a glass of wine or craft beer. A great deal but we weren't in the mood to mess with our dinner (taking a lobster apart takes a bit more effort then we were willing to make at that point lol). That having been said, would love to come back again some day to try!!  We sat at the bar and the bartender (Hillary?) was super lovely and attentive. We chose an order of white wine garlic mussels to share to start. The mussels were cooked perfectly and we didn't find any closed shells (yay!). IMO, the sauce was a bit too light on the flavour but the dish was very tasty overall. I think next time I would try the curry version.   We both ended up ordering a plate of fish and chips for our entrees. The portion size was massive! I ended up taking my leftovers home to my fiance who promptly devoured them. The fish was fried very nicely - light and crispy, not greasy. Both the fries and tartar sauce appeared to be home made, so so good. Very satisfying with a nice pint of craft beer!  Overall, we had a great experience. Definitely will return again someday!"}
{"text":"The food was really great, but the service was very slow. Food wait times were quite long, and when we finally ordered dessert, it took nearly a half hour to arrive. By that point we were having to leave for an event and were asking for the bill. Ended up having to ask for our dessert to go, which came after our request for the bill, and was missing the ice cream that was supposed to come with it. Again, the food was really very good, but 25+ minutes for a deep fried Mars bar is an unreasonably long wait time. Maybe the kitchen didn't get the order in time, or something. Very slow (though still friendly) service."}
{"text":"This place definitely deserves a higher rating. Incredibly friendly people, nice atmosphere, good service, great food, reasonable prices, lots of beers. I had the blackened catfish with penne (a special) and my boyfriend had steak and poutine. Both of our meals were particularly delicious. And when we got our bill we were given not lame mints but turtles! Win! I'd definitely go back here."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, lovely atmosphere. Not \"too cool for school\" or intimidating, just warm and welcoming (literally, warm: they have a fireplace)! It's a pub but it's a little bit fancier and  has fewer blaring TVs. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I found the beers and wines a little pricey and I have only tried the Nachos (which were TO DIE FOR)."}
{"text":"Nachos were really good! Beer selection selection is good, service was good.  Would go back but it's not that special really."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with oyster night! Just came back on a Thursday night with some friends, I believe Monday's they have the special as well. $1.50 per oyster and great beer selection!  I smelled the delicious food that was coming out to other tables, next time I'm coming on an empty stomach and going to try out the burgers! Will have to give an updated review once that happens. ; )"}
{"text":"Oysters were great (and cheap on Mondays) and I surprisingly loved their curry, great flavours and great beers too."}
{"text":"As good as you can get for the price. Great service, high quality well prepared food and cold craft beers. Fresh oysters, amazing octopus and tasty tacos!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on recommendation from 2 local baristas, who we asked \"where can we get a good meal with good craft beer?\" It was a welcome hit. Walking up and down college st. can be overwhelming as there are just so many options, doing that during a Thursday afternoon, even more intimidating. The restaurants and bars don't fill up that much so it's a crapshoot but I've learned to ask locals (so thanks to the guy who recommended).   I'll spare you a photo of the food since I see plenty of them already, and food was just sustenance for our pre-concert drinking but it turned out a highlight. My buddy got the pull pork sandwich for $10 and I got a burger with double smoke bacon (strips), aged cheddar and French fries on it (I asked them to hold on the green onion. Very good. Not the best but one of the better places to eat and drink in West Toronto (and maybe even all of).  Great atmosphere, the woman bartender/host was super welcoming and we gabbed for a bit, very nice staff. The beer was almost all local brews (some Ottawa brews too).   Would return here to eat or drink any day!"}
{"text":"Last stop of the night for the two of us. Man, Thursday nights are absolutely bumping in Toronto. Every bar, club and restaurant that was passed was packed with people enjoying the perfect summer weather. Our last stop ended up being at Hogtown for some good 'ol wine and oysters. Because who can say no to half price oysters?  The inside is dark, intimate and just gives off good vibes. Everyone inside seemed to know each other and from what Ju told me, it's very friendly, family oriented here. I dig it.  Oysters ($18.00 dozen) - That's right, half price oysters on a Thursday! Yes please and thank you. These were fresh and came with a three different sauces to try (can't remember them now) but I think I prefer them in a traditional fashion. Put a bit of horseradish and squeeze some lemon on. Nothing more satisfying than tasting the actual oyster."}
{"text":"This is a decent little place in the heart of the Little Italy area. It was a very busy Friday nite crowd, lots of people.   Bartender & waitstaff were very friendly & we were seated at the bar almost immediately (I like that). I enjoyed the atmosphere & customers...even the transsexual that I had a conversation with.   The food was solid. Salad with house made dressing was very tasty & fresh. The wings could have been cooked more (but I didn't ask for that). The taste & size of the Wings was definitely there. Had a Steamwhistle IPO that went very well with the meal. This is a definite do-over but I'd be more clear on how I want my wings. BTW...great selection of fresh oysters on the menu. I'd try next time."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Everything I've ordered has been so great. Their pulled pork nachos are the best I've ever had. Plus the have a good selection of drinks. Very friendly staff. Casual atmosphere with fun decor. Good place to eat before or after a movie at The Royal Cinema across the street."}
{"text":"We had supper at the Hogtown Pub and Oysters.  Gord ordered Bacon Mac & Cheese ... he said it was delicious and would get it again.   I ordered the Hogtown Beef Burger with bacon and fries ... the burger and fries were good!   Lauren was our server and she took good care of us."}
{"text":"So yesterday I was looking for a place to enjoy some taco tuesday action. Yes, everyone I love tacos and know good one's from bad.   First of all on the website for the business it states that they have Taco Tuesdays. While it does not list the price, I got the price from all of  the wonderful reviews on other review sites.   Taco Tuesday no longer exists and the restaurant would not honor the claim saying that dine TO was the problem. Clearly they haven't checked their own website.   I looked at other food that was coming out and it did not look great, but I decided to try some of the tacos. First of all the restaurant claims that they have been told that they have the best tacos in Toronto. I would like to clarify things by saying that these were some of the worst tacos in Toronto.  Hogtown is a low end oyster bar. These two things shouldn't mix. Judging by the quality of their cooked food I was reluctant to try the oysters.   This place needs a new cook and a new manager, one that will take ownership over his mistakes.   With all the other great places in little italy, be sure to take this place off of your list as it is nothing but a waste of time.   If you are only drinking the beer, enjoy as they do have a great selection."}
{"text":"We had an amazing time. Food was absolutely amazing and service was perfect. What a great place ! Try their Poutine !"}
{"text":"This is little spot was a great for cheap after work veers and... oysters. Yes I surprised at how good the oysters were and they had a great enough selection of hot sauces and toppings for my oyster to keep me satisfied. The waiter was friendly and funny enough to keep us longer than required which in my books is a great plus."}
{"text":"Holy God, I love seafood more than life itself. So when we walked passed this place it was impossible to fight temptation. The interior is pretty and decorated with stone, brick, tree branches and Christmas lights. The server was adorable and the perfect kind of friendly.  I ordered the PE.I. mussels in a wine and garlic sauce ($12). This sauce was the greatest mussel sauce I've ever had. I was actually drinking it after I finished my mussels. They also came with two pieces of delicious bread so if you're here for lunch, that might be enough food to feed a hungry belly. That said, I was still pretty hungry afterwards so I ordered two oysters for $3 each.  The oysters were fine. Nothing special. Two is just not enough. I want to come back here on Wednesday (or Thursday?) when mussels are $1.50 each.   My boyfriend ordered a $9 burger with a side of poutine, which was an additional $6... And a complete joke. The portion was tiny and it was not hot enough for the cheese to melt. The gravy was delicious though. A pitcher of Moosehead cost us $15.93, which is pretty standard.   I would come here again for the mussels and $1.50 oysters.   To be completely honest though, my bf and I were still hungry after and ended up going to Duff's for wings. LOL."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pub in the city. All food is made in house and delicious! Always a friendly face at the bar!"}
{"text":"Real low key place. Good location when everything else on College gets too busy. I didn't think much about their food or drink menu.   Would give it 3 stars, but the facts they judged my Quebec drivers license and medicare ID's as somewhat invalid appalled me. Canadian citizens should not be required to walk around with their passports when they have valid pieces of identification."}
