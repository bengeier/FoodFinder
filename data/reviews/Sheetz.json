{"text":"It's tops on my list.... You can get 3 cents off a gallon of gas if you have a Sheetz card.."}
{"text":"It is always nice when you are in a quick jam and see a Sheetz. The gas station has lots of pumping stations to keep customers moving in and out quickly.  The best part is what is on the inside.  Full kitchen, beer caves, and food selection that outdo any station there is. They have a wonderful made to order cafe which is all computerized. You use a touchscreen to pick your options customizing the order.  Best of all they take pride in being CLEAN!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a quick lunch. They have a large variety of sandwiches and they are always made the way you ordered them from the kiosk"}
{"text":"First, their gas prices are as low as any in the area. This is a great place for a quick sandwich and coffee, too. I stop here fairly often going to or from work."}
{"text":"I stop at this Sheetz every morning to get coffee or a fountain drink on my way to work.  On one occasion the Diet Dr. Pepper was out so I got a different drink and went to the register.  While trying to pay I mentioned they were out of my original beverage just to let them know so they could fix it.  He apologized and told me my drink today was on them.  Another time the cappuccino machine spit the hot beverage out onto my hand and not in the cup.  Once again I let the cashier know and again she apologized and gave me my coffee on the house.  While this only probably saved me about $2 between these two visits, their commitment to customers spoke volumes to me.  Way to go, Sheetz!"}
{"text":"Done trying to get a decent salad from there. Lettuce is always wilted and they use parts of the romaine stalks that should never go in a salad. Other food is OK. For the price I would rather spend my money on better quality product."}
{"text":"This is a nice sheets. They have plenty of drinks smoothies coffees as usual and food. I love the  birthday cake creme , it's one of my favorites definitely will be back here again"}
{"text":"This place is just as nice as it was before \" wish I knew why they took it down! It's close to home. And always open. Staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Yea, yea.... I know some folks believe Sheetz (or Super Sheetz to Matt M, hehe!) is the sign of all evil.   But when you live in Ohio City and your closest gas stations make you feel like you might get mugged, stabbed and left to die on a daily basis, this little gem in Mentor can seem really nice! This coming from someone who choses to live in an urban environment and runs scared of suburbia.   I'm not sure what other gas stations (other than the sub shop at GetGo) let you punch in your food on an ordering screen, just the way you like it, and get it made for you within 5 minutes. Also, love their healthier food options, like to-go fruits and veggies. Check out their wall'o slushies and milkshakes, too. Occasionally they have a low cal strawberry banana slushy that is heavenly. They also have a large wine selection, for a gas station, that is. How can you beat that? Also, I'd don't think I've seen so many different fresh, hot coffee varieties in any gas station before.   Are you savoring fresh, locally-grow produce and nibbling on vegetarian-fed, cage-free meats? Probably not. But is it better than the ghetto, scary gas stations and even some of the nicer ones out there, combined? Yes.   Double bonus? No ATM fees on their end! WOO!"}
{"text":"Gotta love their f'real smoothies and shakes as well as their made to order selections.  You just can't beat 2 hot dogs for $1!  I don't know how long they have had salads, but I made a custom salad and was impressed, especially for a gas station/convenience store.    They even have kids meals!  Granted, you won't get a toy, but do you really want another toy to step on anyways?  Skip the mac n cheese, mac n cheese bites, and despite the pretzel bun, skip the steak n cheese too.  Extra star for clean restrooms!"}
{"text":"My husband grew up on MTOs (Made To Order food that you select on a screen and then they make it for you) and every time we're in the vicinity of a Sheetz, he loves to pop in and get one. It's a fun experience and this location was great. We were both very happy with our meals."}
{"text":"Stopped here to get gas during our road trip. Loved seeing SO MANY slurpee flavors. I've never seen Marshmallow slurpees before. I also liked seeing that they had a grape slurpee which is never to be found where I'm from. Cool place. Lots of options."}
{"text":"They do a good job in service of food quality but they are slow. We go to a sheetz often because we travel and this is the slowest one we have been to."}
{"text":"I never thought I would be telling people that \"yes, I think eating at a gas station is awesome.\" Sheetz has everything from quesadillas, Deli Sandwiches, Salads, Wraps, Grilled Chicken Sandwiches, Pretzel Melts, and awesome fries.   They have 4 touch screens you can use to to customize your made-to-order item. The place is a near zoo no matter what hour of the night you stop in but service is always fast!   Did I mention they are open 24 hours and are perfect for those nights you can't make it to Taco Bell :)"}
{"text":"Yep, as good as it gets fits the title perfectly for this unique gas station. It practically has everything and sadly at nights turns out to be the mentor kids hang out... ya know.. those kids who think they're so cool with their car, parking out front with their music on and large masses of teenage kids. Honestly that seems to only be to downside, but you dont really notice them that much. This sheets is quite big, and it has alot, let me stress, alot of stuff inside it.   I failed to whip out my phone and snag a pic, but next time I'll be sure to take a couple. This sheets even has one of those press coffee/ sandwich /soup/food tablets there you can order up stuff while you go and look around at the shop. The service when I went there was fast, and the lady was quite friendly, mostly because I had to grab a carton of eggs there. Over all, this is one of my favorite stop to go to if I need something quick up the street or passing by.... plus gas prices are not bad there ether!"}
{"text":"They have organic options. They have vegetarian options. They have all of my favorite teas. They're open at the random times I get hungry. They're cheap. I'm so happy lol"}
{"text":"As far as the MTO food goes i have this to say. Be careful ordering the salads like taco salads and whatnot because if you don't pay attention some of the girls won't put the toppings on right. twice i've driven home and found out they didn't put my meat on it. Also they will hand you the bag with the salad stuffed in it sideways (they do it with nachos too) so everything just lumps together in a mess. Some of the sandwiches are \"toasted\" whether you like it or not i found the hard way so when id pay i would ask at the counter for them not to toast it only to find they did anyways many times. Now do you like bacon ? Awesome so do i just not here. They never cook it. They just toss it in a sandwich and toast the sandwich without pre cooking the bacon so it's always uncooked chewy garbage. Which is even more irritating when you pay for double. The worst time to go here is anytime after 10pm. ive gone here repeatedly between 10pm and 4am and it's just the worst.  theres this one girl who just literally screws everything up, even when she's at the counter........i often think she's just stoned out of her mind cause how could you screw up simple things like that so badly ? And don't even get me started on how long it takes."}
{"text":"How does a gas station get four stars?  By having everything you need.  Drinks, food, fresh made sandwiches, coffee, beer, etc etc etc."}
{"text":"I love Sheetz!!!! So many options for such good prices!  I had 2 chili cheese dogs and fries for under $5! Everything about this place is perfect in everyway and may anyone who ever tries to change it in any way burn in hell!!"}
{"text":"A lot of employees working at one time.. the one perk is the food and drinks you can buy from the touch screen. It is prepared quickly. The place was clean. I had no complaints."}
{"text":"The best gas convenience retail outlet!  They take quick trip format to another level MTO made to order food better than subway Jim johns pot belly penn station jersey mikes etc  Fast quality great assortment  Great sheetz!!"}
{"text":"People look at this place as a gas station with decent food. I tend to look at it as a great place to get fresh food, MTO (made to order) that just happens to have a gas station attached. All the food is made fresh after you order it on slick touch screen devices. Sure, you wait a little longer, but it's worth it. They also have great coffee and specialty drinks. Oh, and they have a huge frozen yogurt stand! Gas is decent quality and they have a touch less car wash out back. They also have charging stations for the fancy Tesla car owners! The beer cave in the store offers a good variety of beers including some great craft beer selections like Rhinegeist and local offerings from Brew Kettle and Great Lakes Brewery. I come here for breakfast on weekends once a month, the food is that good! If you need gas and your belly is grumbling, come here and kill two birds with one stone!"}
{"text":"I've come totally full-circle with my relationship with Sheetz.  I'm totally against bigger and better company/stores/gas stations coming in and taking all the business away from the little baby stores across the street.  When I moved home from overseas, I was disgusted at the huge red mushroom lights that was Sheetz that I passed on my way home from the airport.  I said \"I'm never going there, I'm a loyal Speedway customer!\"  But then, I started going, and can't stop.  Their 'My Sheetz Card' is the ONLY card out of 25 on my keychain that I use.  You actually get stuff with it.  About 2-3 times a month, they place an e-coupon on your card, notify you via email which product you can receive free with your Sheetz card, and you just go get it.  Like that.  In the past, these have included: Bag of coffee, made to order sub, Simply Lemonade drink, and many more.  They also have a huge variety of better than average food; tons 'made-to-order' and also a couple coolers of pre-made sandwiches/salads/fruit...etc.    On a lazy day, I recommend ordering some delicious food food then move on to the car wash line and surfing their free internet while enjoying your made-to-order turkey sandwich on pretzel bread.  I'm so thankful to have this new Sheetz near my home.  I'm not even sure if it's my guilty pleasure anymore.  Just a pleasure."}
{"text":"Fill up your tank and your stomach in one quick stop.  Not much to say about the gas station part, but the quick mart is large and any food ordered is made your way.  If something you want is not offered on the touch screen, they can usually add it if you catch the person making your stuff.  I've never had a problem with service and the food is good.  Better that some fast food joints!"}
{"text":"The best sheets I've been too. Always so quickl on all of the food orders. Staff is pretty friendly too."}
{"text":"I love Sheetz, because we have nothing like it at home. The problem with this one is that It's not clean, the inventory was picked over and sparse, the coffee was cold, and the made to order food takes forever."}
{"text":"This is your typical convenience gas station about the level of a pilot gas station. They have plenty of options for snacks food and drinks."}
