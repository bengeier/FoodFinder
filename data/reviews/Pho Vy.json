{"text":"A nice little hole in the wall palace. The inside is decorated nicely, and we were seated immediately. The food took a while to get out. They shrimp salad rolls we're great, and so was the peanut sauce that came with them.  My sister had to wait an extra five minutes after everybody else to get her food. I got the seafood with crispy noodles. The seafood was okay, but the noodles and sauce were bland, and my brothers chicken was charred.

Would go back, but order something different."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pho restaurants in Calgary, they're small quaint location is very comforting and their service has never let me down. I really do enjoy their soups as they are indeed packed full of flavor and you can tell that they've spent time on perfecting their broth."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed anything we have ordered and concur with the previous reviewer, friendly and accommodating staff."}
