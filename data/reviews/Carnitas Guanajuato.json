{"text":"My wife and I went here because we had a Groupon for this restaurant and, we're always looking for good places that we haven't tried. when we arrived, we were a little unsure about the place.it's right off highway 74 in an area that features several hispanic businesses . it sits around behind a tienda in what looks at first to be the basement. well, don't let the looks fool you. this is probably the best authentic Mexican food that we have found in the carolinas. now, the menu is in Spanish but, they were more than happy to help sort it out for us. my wife had a shrimp dish that came with pico de gallo  and I had the pollo chipotle . the servings were more than generous and the flavor was out of this world. my chicken had this wonderful smokey flavor with just the right amount of kick. the service is great and the staff is very friendly . we will be going back and probably taking some friends along."}

{"text":"There are a lot of Mexican restaurants in Charlotte, but this is the only one I have found that has pork skin tacos. That's right, cracklins on a taco. It doesn't get much better than this. Crispy fried pork fat on a taco. Yum. Hubby had the BBQ lamb plate and all that was left at then end of the meal were some licked clean bones.   They also offer \"fruit waters\" which are excellent. All they need is some rum to throw in the pina one and they would have a great Pina Colada."}
{"text":"Real carnitas! Cactus salad, rotisserie chicken; other than Mexico there's Catnitas Guanajuato. Authentic & extremely good! Nice people as well..."}
{"text":"This place is legit.  Best carnitas in town, without a doubt.  The refried beans are also excellent as is the guacamole!  Packaged all together inside the homemade corn tortilla and it is heaven.  Go there."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food located in a very oddly placed  area underneath a grocery store. You have to drive into the parking lot, with the location on the corner of the buildings bottom floor.   If you don't find it, keep looking! It's worth the treasure hunt, as the food is very good. The Carnitas is delicious, and you can get it two ways... With all the trimmings (aka ears and other assorted pieces of unnamed pork) or just the meat. It comes with Nopales (cactus) which pairs well with the food."}
{"text":"Not closed- just moved to Albarmarle Road, in the shopping center where the Dollar Tree is near Sharon Amity."}
{"text":"This restaurant defines the locals term \"sketch-mex.\" but in a good way. Nestled beneath a Mexican grocery store, the fluorescent bulbs crackled and  I was instantly transported back to old Mexico. Instead of the simple chips and salsa, I was greeted with a smorgasbord of salsa delights. The waitress spoke about as much english as I do spanish but I recognized the restaurants namesake and went for the carnitas.  They were very good especially with the salsa verde. I'd like to go back sometime and try something else."}
{"text":"Located in the same building as El Ranchero hispanic supermarket, but on the back side of the building, ground floor, separate parking lot. inside is decorated like a standard mexican restaurant.  I only tried the tacos, but they were very good.  Soft taco tortilla was soft and chewy, irregularly textured so i'm assuming hand made, and the lengua meat was well seasoned and tasty, came with cilantro and onion.  Hard taco shells were filled to the brim with lettuce, crema (the crumbly cheese), tomatos, and meat.  The namesake carnitas were delicious, very full of porky flavor, not over done or dry, i highly recommend giving this a taste.  I had the verde salsa, which was also good and well seasoned.    dont let the location dissuade you, the service is good and friendly and the meats were particularly tasty. tacos were reasonably priced, cost about $8-9 for my 4 a la carte tacos, and took less than 10 min to prepare my takeout order."}
{"text":"Excellent new Mexican restaurant located off Highway 74 in Monroe. In my opinion, it is probably the best Mexican cuisine in Monroe and the surrounding area. Carnitas Guanajuato takes the chip and salsa experience to another level.   The chips here are fresh and do not taste like reheated, store-bought tortilla chips. The tray of salsa comes with 5 different varieties! A few of which include tomatillo, mild, spicy, and pico. They have lunch specials for around $6-$8.   I would like to revisit to try one of the specials! This place is producing delicious, authentic Mexican specialities. The flavors here are bold and unique. I loved the green chile salsa. The rice and beans tasted fresh and not out of a can as most places seem to taste. I will definitely be back here soon."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall. It's in a basement underneath a grocery store. But oh my was it amazing. Literally one of the most flavorful places I've ever eaten at in Monroe. Menu in English but the ladies didn't really speak it. But it was amazing I cannot stress that enough."}
{"text":"New location   2300 A West Roosevelt Blvd, Monroe, NC 28110  Is the same one from Walkup Ave.  In a newer much nicer building.  This is a nice place with the most authentic Mexican food."}
