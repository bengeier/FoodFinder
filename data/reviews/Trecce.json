{"text":"Great seafood and great place. The service is amazing and the staff is very friendly. The wine prices are quite reasonable. I really like this place!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal - had the Mediterranean pizza and my wife had the grilled calamari and rapini. Delicious. Service was excellent- decor is clean simple and elegant but not pretentious."}
{"text":"Came once with a group of friends for dinner and had a great meal. My friend and I split the Mediterranean pizza which was pretty good and the ricotta ravioli in Gorgonzola sauce which was excellent. All homemade and great quality. The homemade tiramisu for dessert was also really great. Tried a bite of my friend's Margherita pizza and thought it was excellent too. Service was friendly and prompt! Came back another day for a takeout meatball sandwich and it was AMAZING. Wow. Best $9 lunch ever! So filling and all homemade and super fresh. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I and my friends ordered Margarita and mushroom pizza, it was horrible. It was the thinnest pizza I've ever had. There was not enough cheese nor sauce on it, too dry. It's way too expensive for that quality. I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Generous rating. Hate to do it but.... Not sure out of the three things I ordered what I liked. Took it home, no better the second day. Sorry but there are so many better options on the D, like right next door. Turn left on exit."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to check this place out for the first time today (June 1/2018). we love close by and have been waiting to go. We're certainly going to go back, it was quite nice. Here's my take on the place - in the form of the story of our dinner.  We brought our 10 mos old daughter with us. Not a big deal but we had to lift the stroller up one step.  Trecce lacks a ramp into the store unfortunately. The front entrance is tiny, barely enough room for two people to fit by each other - however the rest of the restaurant is laid out really well. We sat at the very front of the restaurant off to the right and our stroller folded up fit well behind the table.  Our server was great - from looking at the other photos here on Yelp I think her name was Sabrina. She was quite attentive and knowledgeable.   So we sat down, got a high chair for the little one, was served some nice fresh bread. We had grilled calamari (which tasted GREAT but was slightly rubbery) along with an arugula salad (see my pic). Wifey had the margarita pizza and I had the fettuccine a la vodka with shrimp. Overall the food was quite good. The ambience, the price, the service and the layout made this place an overall joy to be had.   Oh yeah and we really liked how you can see the pizza oven too. That was cool :)"}
{"text":"We came here at Thursday afternoon for lunch. It's decorated very trendy and the waitress was very pleasant. I had a chicken sandwich which was an amazing deal it was a big piece of chicken with a nice crunchy coating with herbs. My boyfriend had the meatball sandwich which came on an a nice ciabatta bun. I ordered a sign of rapini and he had the stretchela (sp?) soup which were both nice and homemade. The food took a while to come consideing it wasnt too busy but it was hot n fresh.  Will come back to try the pasta!"}
