{"text":"Classiest bar on Madison.  Nice patio when it's warm too!  Even a fireplace.  I've only had their burgers with sweet potato fries - half off on Thursdays!  ALSO, my most valid reasoning for loving this place is that they offer both $2.50 beers AND craft options.  It is great."}
{"text":"I guess it's because I never go here during the busiest times/days, but I never have anything less than a 5-star experience. The service is fantastic, and although I'm honestly not a fan of Irish food, everything I've had here is very tasty. Oh, and you should definitely try the brunch!"}
{"text":"Sullivan's is a good Irish pub in heavily Irish Lakewood. I came on a Friday night and was surprised at the lack of crowds in the place. I agree with some of the other reviewers in that there's something about the way the place is set up that keeps it from feeling like a neighborhood pub. You choose your own seat upon entering and a waiter will come to your table. My biggest complaint of the whole night was how slow the service was. The pub wasn't very crowded at all and yet, our waiter took forever to take our order. He couldn't be any friendlier and pleasant, but for some reason, he just took forever. Also, the tables are too low to the ground for someone who's 6'2\" like me. I felt cramped in the table. However, in disagreement with some of the other reviewers, I found the food to be pretty good. I had the smoked salmon torte as an appetizer, which had an excellent combination of flavor, between the slices of smoked salmon, the herb cream cheese, the horseradish, and the red onions inside a puff pastry. It was really good, and it wasn't as rich as it could've been. For my entree, I had the Shepard's Pie, which I thought was excellent. It was a very traditional Shepard's Pie and it definitely tasted good. The only complaint was it took forever to cool off. For dessert, I had a decadent slice of the Turtle Cheesecake. It was large, rich, and sure felt good. It had chocolate chunks, pecans, and caramel on top as well as whipped cream. I'm sure it was about 1100 calories, but it was worth it. Overall, Sullivan's is a nice place for Irish food, but be warned; the service is slow and there isn't much of a pub feel."}
{"text":"Unlike the moronic previous reviewer, I've actually patronized Sullivans.   It's a good place to eat and drink.  The Monte Carlo sandwich is great."}
{"text":"My favorite Irish-styled pub in the area.  Lots of great items on the menu.  You can't go wrong with the huge portion of fish and chips (my favorite), or any of the boxty dishes (all delicious). Try the cheddar dip with boxty wedges - simple, but awesome.    Cool, interesting decor.  Look up at the ceiling.  I like sitting in the 'library' section with the bookcases.    Lots of good music over the PA too  - a mixture of traditional/modern Irish/Celtic + related pop artists.  One of the few places in town where you'll hear music by cool bands like Great Big Sea.  A nice selection of beers - Irish, English, Scottish + more.   I have to laugh sometimes when I hear someone at one of the other tables ordering something like a Bud Lite, when there are all these other great  beer choices!  Sullivan's - don't ever change.  Love the food and service, that's why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"I would have-enthusiastically and without reservation-given Sullivan's 5 stars only a few months ago. Alas, we befell a small tragedy that removed this fabulous local establishment of the final feather in its cap.  My man had a rather unfortunate bout with what we can only guess was food poisoning after a visit to Sullivan's. We were there with a good friend, and the three of us ordered different things. Tyler got fish and chips, I got the Apple Cider Chicken (more on that later), and John got the shepherd's pie. When we came home, he said something didn't feel right. He spent the next 24 hours violently ill. I am sure it was a fluke; we've ordered the shepherd's pie dozens of times in the past to no ill effects.  Needless to say, neither of us plans to order that particular dish ever again. :(  But, on the plus side, there are so many positives that I could never write off this restaurant entirely:  1) The ambiance is incredible. The interior is gorgeous and (to my less-traveled self) looks just like I would imagine a real Irish pub to be.  2) They have the world's best root beer. Seriously, try ordering it next time you visit. It comes in a huge frosty stein and has such a crisp, complex taste. I am a connoisseur of good root beer, and this is one of my all-time favorites.  3) The Apple Cider Chicken is the only reason I need this restaurant. Sure, it has amazing fish and chips, and the boxty wedges and cheddar dip, and a fantastic Guinness BBQ sandwich, but the Apple Cider Chicken is a deal-breaker for me. I rarely order anything else. It has an incredibly creamy apple cider sauce, and is topped with the most flavorful combination of dried cranberries and mushrooms coated with more of the sauce. Seriously, order it. It takes a lot for me to wax poetic about a freakin' chicken breast on a plate, but this dish has it all.  4) This restaurant has ample floor space, and is fabulous for groups. We have brought as many as 25 and they have seated us and taken care of us with no trouble. They placed us in the back section, which has shelves and shelves of old books and knick-knacks. I believe they referred to the area as \"The Library\"  5) This is a perfect spot for a date. It's large inside, yet it feels intimate and cozy and warm, and it's casual while still feeling special as a date spot. We've gone several times on dates here.  All in all, the food is fantastic, the decor perfection. I hope this place continues to thrive and remain a part of our community."}
{"text":"This is one of the best all around great bars in Cleveland. It isn't too \"hip\" even though it is classy, clean, and authentic, so you can actually meet up with your friends and just chill. It is definitely not  pick up spot, but it is always a great time."}
{"text":"Love the Pub Toasty. Nice atmosphere and lots of room to stretch out."}
{"text":"Pretty good and authentic Irish food and pretty well priced"}
{"text":"\"Authentic\" can sometimes mean \"bland.\"  THE UP-SIDE:  Big, open space with some character.  Nice staff and a good selection of Irish dishes.  Clean and family-friendly.  THE DOWN-SIDE:  Maybe it's just me...  The food lacks a certain oomph.  I suppose it may be \"authentic\" but it still is kinda bland at times.    THE SUM-IT-UP:  If you're in the mood for Irish food and a decent selection of beer, give this place a try.  You definitely won't \"hate it.\"  You may, or may not, \"love it.\""}
{"text":"Ah, Sullivan's.   If only you were a few streets closer instead of the twelve that you are, I imagine that I'd stumble home many more times than just March 17th. Each time I walk in, I'm transported to a simpler time, where Murphy's Oil Soap was akin to Febreeze, the waxy, lemony smell of church pews. It is without a doubt one of my most favorite smells that exist in this world, and I knew immediately this would be a place to imbibe and imbibe well. In the winter, the pot bellied stove crackles to life, adding the wood smoke to the air in perfect balance with the Murphys and the aromas of the foodstuffs in the kitchen.   The atmosphere is as laid back as could be. Thick, plush benches look like something -- quite possibly -- out of eighteenth century Ireland and are perfect for sipping a Guinness or three. Even the short wooden stools are surprisingly comfortable, even for someone with a large posterior, such as this reviewer. The walls are covered in murals, and the posters for Guinness are the envy of some collector friends. I'm dissapointed everytime the waiter(ess) doesn't speak in a thick Irish brogue I barely understand.   There is one downfall to Sullivan's, however, one that I'm remiss to speak of -- The food. Don't get me wrong -- it's far better than most of your run of the mill chain restaurants that spend millions to have their finger directly on the pulse of a focus group, forcing flavors and tastes on an American populace that could care less about nineteen hundred calorie salads. The Monte Cristo is wonderful, and the Fish and Chips are as authentic as this never-ever-left-Ohio guy can surmise. But, there doesn't seem to be anything that screams out and begs you to try it. There's nothing eye catching or out of the ordinary.   Truth be told, that downfall is forgivable. Try going sometime with a group of friends, and I dare you not to feel like you're at home, kicking back a few drinks and transporting yourself to a different time. I dare you to try and keep track of time. You won't be able to."}
{"text":"I have been to this Pub three times, and finally I am calling it quits. The first two times the food was average, nothing to write home about. The third time, the food was terrible! Everyone's food was extremely salty. When we told the waiter about the issue, all he did was shrug his shoulders and say \"I'll tell the cook.\"  That is terrible customer service in my book. He should have offered to replace the food, or even offered a complementary dessert.    I feel I gave the place a fair chance, but the quality just kept going down hill. It is a shame as it is very cute inside with nice woodwork."}
{"text":"Place has been closed for months. Perfect example of bad management"}
{"text":"This place gets so many things right!  It has an amazing atmosphere, and and old pub feel, and it is really much larger than it looks from the street!  Their food is really great as well!  I had a corned beef and cabbage boxty--delish!  They also have a really descriptive beer menu that lets you choose based upon name, serving type, and alcohol content.  Another cool thing is that you can join their club, and get your own personalized beer mug, which they will display in the pub when you aren't drinking from it.  AWESOME.  One thing that I wish were different is the food running.  It seems that serving an entire table at once is a lost art.  Some people at my party of 8 were served long before others."}
{"text":"I don't know a lot about this place so let's focus on what I like:  The inside is really nice! They have a big bar, a big beer selection, it's nice, open airy.  The patio is really nice too!  The fireplace is huge and warm and there's just the right amount of tables so it's still intimate.  I've only tried a couple of the food items but both were about as good as it gets!  The Irish egg rolls were like crispy stuffed Reubens and oh so good!  I got the Apple Cider Chicken at the recommendation of Yelper Dana P, you know what you're talking about!  This chicken is amazing and you have to try it!  One would never suspect a cranberry and mushroom combo to be this delicious but I loved every bite.  The carrot mash thing that accompanied it, that I could do without.  I should have gotten some potatoes or something!  My only complaint, and the reason I gave it 3 stars is that I thought it was over priced.  My entree (the chicken) was $13, and it was just one small chicken breast.  I don't know, maybe my expectations are skewed because I could have eaten a whole plate of it!  Or maybe I'm just poor.  I probably will go back this summer, but I think as more of a beer and appetizer place!"}
{"text":"If it's not good irish food, it's authentic.   Having said that I really like  this place. Great bar to hang out at. Good atmoshpere, friendly service. I wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"This place is really great but I don't come here often enough. The food is yummy for Irish food. There's something about it though...can't put my finger on why it's not more popular. Is it because the tables are too far apart? Too much bare floor showing? Needs couches? Rugs? Better location? I dunno. Something keeps it from the being the comfy cozy bar that you think it should be when you walk in. Maybe it's just still too \"new\" feeling? Well, see for yourself. I still like it though!"}
{"text":"Good as drink is, it ends in thirst.  Great place to grab some grub, hang out with a group of friends and drink one of the many Irish beers on tap."}
{"text":"This place reminded me a bit of Flannery's Downtown with its fun and modern Irish pub feel.  Unfortunately I didn't get to experience the inside much - we sat out on the back patio. Our server was super friendly and the prices were good.  I'd love to come back and experience more of this place!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and great patio are worth one star, the beer selection another, but the food is hit or miss at best.  It's utterly average and barely worth the price when there are so many terrific restaurants in Lakewood.  Everything we had was underseasoned, the mussel appetizer was overcooked, and the slices of avocado on my salad had a gelatinous texture that might only be explained by pre-cutting and a long soak in a bowl of icewater before plating. The salmon sandwich I got as a replacement was nicely cooked, but the accompanying \"lemon mayonnaise\" was really tartar sauce. My husband's corned beef was bland and sliced with the grain so it was a tougher chew. Overall, we were left with the impression that the kitchen is cheaping out on ingredients - maybe the money went into the decor? But the fries were good, so there's that.  There's a reason Sullivan's is nearly empty on a Friday night..."}
{"text":"Sullivan's is a place that I really enjoy going to hang out.  The setup of the restaurant is very open and informal.  You seat yourself in a variety of tables or booths, and there is really nowhere in the place that you feel cramped.  On the downside, it can be a little difficult to seat a large group together, but it can work.  There is a great selection of beer and a friendly staff.  The food is pretty good but nothing stellar.  I'm a fish and chips fan, and they do it well here (again, not outstanding but very solid).  I did enjoy the Irish Egg Rolls, but that could have been because of the beer that was accompanying them.  It is the atmosphere that draws me to Sullivan's rather than the food.  It is a laid back, easy place to spend an evening."}
{"text":"I was in a really bad mood a couple weeks ago. I didn't really want to be around anybody or do much of anything. One of my closest friends called me up and said that he and his wife were heading to Sullivan's. My old man's retirement/going away party was here. Bitter sweet memory. I sampled a lot of appetizers on that occasion without eating an entrée. When I returned with my friend, I decided on eating some big food to ease the pain. A little conversation, jokes, laughter, IPA buzz and I felt recharged and ready for the world! This was a very family friendly business. There was some crazy kid in a Raiders shirt scampering around being wild. His parents could not control him too well. An older guy who was a regular almost knocked into some cute girl who was out on a date. The bartender told him it was time to go. There was a nice fire burning inside. Overall, the atmosphere was great along with the service and food. As much as I like going to the Harp, I may prefer Sullivan's."}
