{"text":"Love this place!  Food is consistently great, the staff is always friendly, the prices are reasonable.   One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I went to Thirteen North on Saturday, June 6th with three other people in the party.  We called ahead to see if we needed to make a reservation, and we didn't.  When we arrived, we were greeted by a young, but friendly hostess.  She lead us out to the patio and let us configure our table however we liked, which was nice.  The patio was well lit, with nice greenery, and faces Northern Avenue.  The noise level was less than what I expected, and I liked the ambiance.  It was actually kind of nice to watch all the activity on the street.  Our server came over right away to drop off waters, and provided us with menus and a wine list.  He also asked if we saw the specials on the board, of which there were about 6, and asked if we needed to hear them again.   I really appreciated the wine list.  It was short, and very accessible, with nothing over $50, as I recall.  Most notably, they had Erath, an Oregon Pinot Noir, and my favorite.  I also believe that all the wines are available by the glass, as well as the bottle, which is nice.  One of my dinner partners ordered the house red, which was really delish, and a bargain!  I ordered the 7 oz Gorgonzola crusted filet with mashed potato (which was on special), others ordered the stuffed sole, New York Strip, and the lobster mac and cheese.  I was really pleased by my dish.  I also enjoyed a bite of the stuffed sole, served with orzo.  I'm not one who would order fish, but I would consider ordering this dish next time.  The lobster mac and cheese was also very tasty.  Sometimes, I find Mac and Cheese to be too rich, or overpowering, or downright glopy and unappetizing, but this dish had the right balance, and you really got to enjoy the lobster as well.  My dish was perfect!  Cooked well, served beautifully, and portioned properly.  The service was excellent, and as mentioned in other reviews, a manager came over to see how we were doing.  I was very happy with the service.  It was attentive, friendly and informative, without being overkill.  (Sometimes, I feel that there can be too much service, and I feel like I am taking my SAT's / being stalked.)  I felt very welcome.  Overall, I was really happy to find this local gem.  I guess as a final note of approval, I will take my mother here when she visits from out of state.   I agree with poster Jen H., that I will update Thirteen North tot 5 stars after I go there a few more times, which I plan to as soon as possible."}
{"text":"This was a challenging rating. We were a tough group to handle, and they handled it with mixed success. I was at dinner with my family; a group of nine with three kids ranging from 3-10, a vegan, a vegetarian, and a meat eater. So finding a restaurant is no easy task.   We made a reservation for 6:30pm, in hopes it would be early enough that the kids would not be too tired. Unfortunately, that wasn't necessarily the case, so we were not the most ideal family to be around. The wait staff were gracious, they were patient with the kids and were sure to bring out their food before ours. They even made a dish special order for one of the kids since there wasn't anything on the menu he wanted. They also offered a kids sized plate of mac and cheese rather than the full order.   Unfortunately, other aspects were more of a disappointment.  After they brought out the kids meals, we had a good 20 min wait before the adult meals appeared. And one order was even later. The food was ok, but nothing that would entice me to necessarily return. The fish taco and the bruschetta were the highlights. And they were really good, the lobster mac and cheese was a bit underwhelming and the tilapia was overly salty.   I really wanted to like this place, but in the end, it was just ok."}
{"text":"Ok, so we never made it back until now.  Better late than never?  The restaurant is under new ownership so new menu, upgraded decor, etc.  The minute we walked in we were greeted by multiple members of the staff.  We were dressed kind of casual so we sat at the bar rather than a table.  There was a funny regular sitting at the bar that helped us choose the first course:  The Parmesan Tuile.  We were very hesitant (hubby is not a fan of cheese) but the regular told us we wouldn't regret it. Well that didn't suck!  It's essentially the leaning tower of pisa made of cheese.  You know when the cheese in your grilled cheese sandwich oozes out the side right onto the flat top? That's what it's made of.  So hard to explain.  Just try it.  It comes with marinara and poblano dipping sauces.  The marinara is killer but the poblano...yum!    We decided to split a wedge salad.  They gave us the option of having it served chopped or the usual style.  I asked for it chopped but with the onions on the side.  The bartender said they use kind of like a pico de gallo so it's impossible to separate the onions.  No problem, I'll try it as-is.  Holy crap it was THE best wedge salad I've ever had!  Even with onions!  No joke.  Who knew pico would work that well on a wedge.    So many good choices for the main course!  My hubby chose the meatloaf, I chose the jambalaya.  (I'm a firm believer in the only thing that should come in a loaf is bread.) I did ask if they could spice it up a bit.  They were able to and it worked!  The meal was full of shrimp, chicken and sausage with a good heat and great taste.  Took half of it home and had if for lunch the next day.   Oh, almost forgot, the rose on the menu was killer.  We'll def be back!"}
{"text":"Great open faced NY strip sandwich.  The homemade chips were especially impressive!"}
{"text":"Late dinner on Monday: excellent & friendly service from Clay and other staff. Had the Cheesesteak au jus, whose flavor was a perfect balance of delicate flavors, and not greasy. Other items ordered were the hamburger and Philly steak, which were equally good; great fries. Great ambience to hang out and talk."}
{"text":"Sorry for the two stars because the food was not bad. We went in for breakfast. The restaurant was so dark. The floor was even too dark to tell where to walk as you could not see if there were steps or bumps to watch for. The place was not busy but our food was still barely warm. You get one piece of toast for a dollar.  The bloody Mary was pretty good. Five bucks."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a terrible review for a restaurant in our neighborhood, but unfortunately, the following is what they earned. We drive by Thirteen North often as it is located near our home. We love to eat local and tried this restaurant once many years ago, but for whatever reason never returned.  More recently I noticed they were offering Groupons, so I made a mental note that the establishment may be struggling and that we should go in and support our neighbors.  Big mistake. Upon entering (myself, Husband, and 3 year old daughter) we were walked toward a 2 person table and offered a high chair. Possibly the hostess has never had children...possibly?...so I kind of understand why she may have thought that a 3 year old will sit in a high chair. Mine definitely does not. We declined and she was so kind as to offer us a larger table so we could all sit in a chair.  When our server arrived we each tried to order a drink. She had no problem with my tea or Husband's water, but when we asked for milk for our daughter she replied \"this is not Denny's\". (WE SHOULD HAVE LET AT THAT MOMENT) We stayed and ordered our food. While waiting for our mediocre entrees to arrive, the server yelled from a few tables down that we \"need to drink in unison\" so she doesn't have to fill my drink and then come back to fill his later. It was most likely meant as a joke, but that is the type of thought she should not articulate. (I told her she does not need to fill mine anymore...wouldn't want to take time away from her leaning on the bar doing NOTHING). When we were finished eating (I only ate half of my pasta) she took the plates away quickly, did not offer a box, and dropped the check. We will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"Order a side of the hot - sweet & sour sauce with anything you order. It is the BEST!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Mac & Cheese is one of the best I've had.  Blue Bayou burger was done perfectly rare as requested with the right amount of pungent Blue Cheese."}
{"text":"We will give them another chance -- had a nice conversation with the owner who said they are reviewing and revising policies to be sure they are \"neighborhood friendly\".  The food was definitely good enough to make it worth the try, so we will.  Watch for an update when we do."}
{"text":"Great food and they have a weekend special $6 burgers! Mac and cheese is good here too"}
{"text":"Burger was perfect!  Wedge salad was yummy...only thing we'd skip was the crunchy ribs. Not as good as they sounded.  Service was great, good wine choices & priced right.  Oh & homemade chips are YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. Someone called this a bar. It's not a bar. It's a modern, classy, but very comfortable & casual restaurant with a bar in it. There's a lot of grey slate used as part of the decor. Very attractive restaurant, bar, &  atmosphere. It's cool, has different areas to sit in the restaurant, as well as seating at the bar and to the side of the bar. They have a great outdoor patio covered with pretty red tarps for outdoor seating. I liked the entire layout & atmosphere.   We went on a Sunday. We just missed happy hour. They have happy hour every Saturday & Sunday until 5pm. They have a $6 special on a 1/2 pound angus burger, and you build it with whatever you want. Great deal! Appetizers & drinks are reduced. They have a short reverse happy hour from 8pm-9pm on weekends.   We used a restaurant.com, and got $15 off our bill.   All burgers are 1/2 pound angus beef. . I ordered the patty melt with very sauteed onions and mushrooms,and melted cheese. Very good. The onions & mushroom were fantastic.  It needed no condiments. My burger was $9 and came with a great variety of side choices, I got the sweet potato fries. Good, with a light flavor.   My husband ordered the steak wrap which was served on a healthier wheat tortilla, with sliced steak, and lots of sauteed vegetables in it. Very good, too.   We ordered the hot crab dip appetizer. This is a must buy. Fantastic!! This comes with home made potato chips, and a bowl of delicious hot creamy crab dip. This was awesome. $9.00. They serve it with way too many chips, but you can always bring them home.   For a Sunday, the restaurant & bar were busy. We got there just after happy hour ended, so there were people there from earlier taking advantage of happy hour food and pricing.    The service was outstanding. The wait staff were very attentive and constantly refilled our drinks.   Everyone around us was having a very good time. Definitely a great place for food, atmosphere, modern, cool, and comfortable. It was interesting to see all of the high end cars in the parking lot - Escalades, BMW's, Porsches....yet they were all there drinking the cheaper drinks & food on happy hour.   The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the lack of tvs. There was one in the bar area. I didn't see another one. I'm a big sports fan, so I would want to be able to see a tv here or there in the restaurant or a couple more in the bar area.    Highly recommend. Great food. Great atmosphere. Very casual, but modern and nice. Prices for entrees range from $7.50-$22. The average prices were $8-$11."}
{"text":"I went in for the $5 burgers today, the blonde server gave us awesome service, i was very pleased all around"}
{"text":"Best WEDGE salad TOPPINGS!  I know a wedge is just a wedge of lettuce. But this particular wedge had the best amount/size and flavor of toppings: bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, diced tomatoes, then it was drenched in bleu cheese that for us being here the first time, made the dinner fantastic.   My son had the steak dinner with mushrooms, mashed potatoes and gravy, and ate the whole thing.   I liked the quaint setting, in a strip mall, and I think it will be convienient for us since we just live up the road."}
{"text":"Fantastic! A great place for any occasion, terrific food, great service and an appealing setting. I went with the open face ny steak sandwich topped with cheese and sautéed onions on a slice of French bread.  I was a little skeptical at first as I'm use to a true steak sandwich but eating this with a fork was perfect, the bread was the perfect texture with a lil crunch,  the steak was oh so tender and the onions had great flavor. This is a MUST have.  I went with a side of pesto pasta which also was delicious and filling and I was not let down from trying something other than my favorite sweet potato fries.  My wife went with the French dip and was raving about it. Definitely give this spot a try you won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review. I am more satisfied with the service and food has been great. Just a little comment, the chef should be a little more willing to accommodate special orders that are easy to do. Weather is perfect for their patio! I also recommend the burger special on the weekend."}
{"text":"Larry - the owner- treats my friends and family like VIP every time. The food is good and made to order. Try it once!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my daughter and girlfriend. It wasn't busy at all and there were several staff just  standing around. Our waitress was nice but not very professional. I ordered the Prime Dip with no onions or cheese, my daughter got wings, and my girlfriend got the Chicken Marsala.   A food runner brought out the Prime Dip and Chicken Marsala, and the first thing I noticed about the Prime Dip is that it had cheese on it! I feel like the waitress wouldn't have made that mistake if she was more focused on doing her job instead of being social with the rest of the staff. The waitress apologized and took it back to the kitchen to get me a new one. While I'm waiting for my food and my girlfriend is eating hers I'm wondering where my daughters wings are.   When the food runner brings back my Prime Dip I ask where my daughters wings are and she said she doesn't know. Then I see her talk to the waitress who took the order and the waitress goes to the computer to enter it in. She forgot to put it in!   My Prime Dip was very disappointing. It tasted decent but barely had any meat on it. For a $12 French Dip it was pathetic. Honestly you could go to Stumpy's a couple stores down and get an awesome French dip for less money.   By the time I'm almost finished eating, the wings finally came out. I wouldn't eat here again.   P.S. My girlfriend enjoyed the Chicken Marsala"}
{"text":"It's too bad too... the menu actually looked pretty good... been here for 55 minutes waiting for our food with two kids under 5... only been asked if we needed waters once... and there are only two other tables with people... the restaurants practically empty... and there are 5 servers on the floor..... this is the worst wait and service I've had in a long time.  I won't be back...  and just to add insult to injury they got two orders out of four orders wrong and forgot the kids pancakes...  I had their huevos rancheros and my mom had their Eggs Benedict...i expected it to be at least above average... and it was hardly edible.   Don't waste your money trying to eat here... there are way better options close by."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome! I love the crab dip and the sweet potatoe fries are excellent with the chili dipping sauce. I always sit at the bar and Jeff is great!  Recommend highly for the service and the food!"}
{"text":"We had our work Christmas party here.  The BLTA sandwich was awesome...best I ever had."}
{"text":"A unique take on some of America's favorite foods. The honey garlic wings were some of the best I've had. My husband loved the lucky 13 burger, sweet potato fries and accompanying sweet chili sauce. The staff was friendly and helpful in accommodating my gluten free request for the 3 cheese Mac and cheese. The atmosphere was comfortable and every staff member helped to ensure a good visit. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Basic American-style food done well - sounds easy but how often do I actually find that?  I do at Thirteenorth (yes it's one word, not too).  In the last two months since the opening I've probably been there a dozen or more times (it's close, good, reasonably priced).  Everything is fresh made and I've enjoyed eery meal.  Consistency goes a long way for me.  The burgers are outstanding - and apparently it CAN be hard to make a good burger because I don't find them many places.  The cheesy version is a bit over the top with cheese for my personal taste, so I go for the plain and simple beef/lettuce/onion.  Mmmm.  Other favorites of mine are:  salmon flat bread, lobster mac & cheese, sweet potato fries, ahi appetizer or salad, creme brule, cheesecake.   The French dip was fine but not fabulous, as was the pan fried walleye.    I've had great service every time I've been there.  I do eat at the bar most times so I'm less familiar with the table service.  the staff has been pleasant, quick, and courteous.  One night I pulled in around 9:55 after seeing Brophy H.S.'s production of Hairspray - I was famished because I'd missed lunch and dinner and was desperate for food - the kitchen was closed and the chef was socializing at the bar - but he went back and made me a burger and fires anyway.  How many places would do that for a customer?  The atmosphere is little cold and industrial, with busy Northern Ave and the ugly apartments across the street in full view - ugh.  Good thing everything else makes me not care."}
{"text":"Our large family came on Mother's Day.  We felt really at home, not rushed as you can be on a Mother's Day.  The service was above and beyond what was necessary.  The food was good too!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Larry, Becky, and staff were very helpful- and friendly! I went in for lunch with an employee and thought it would the perfect spot for a group lunch with my Production Team. I made a reservation that day with Larry for the following Friday.   Now, trying to please 15 people (with no complaints at all) is very hard to do. To be honest, we've never ALL be pleased with one particular place.   Well, my staff was so please with not only the food, but the outstanding service; they were blown away by this amazing restaurant. I highly recommend stopping by. You will not be let down. Thanks again Larry!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, service, and the food was amazing! Becky was awesome at accommodating our large party for lunch in a timely manner. Will definitely have to go back to check out brunch!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times with friends over the past few months and food is good along with wine bottle specials. Large menu selection so will be back to try some more items."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a Friday night date with the wife!  I had the Hot Mess burger ... just right in terms of so iciness. Got the sweet potatoe fries in the side. I could have had them as a meal in and of themselves, but sadly there weren't very many. $9  My wife had the cob salad and clam chowder. The salad was almost orgasmic ... it was like the risotto scene from Seinfeld. She was in heaven. $11  Our waiter was friendly, attentive, and helpful.  Overall, a great place for a night out."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area so my wife and I tried to Thirteen North. Kind of an older crowd. Nice decor on inside. Service was very friendly and welcoming. The food was just okay. I had the walleye pike and it was cooked well but nothing to write home about. Wife had the mac and cheese, which was pretty good but I've had better (there are just a lot of places serving mac and cheese now so the market is pretty competitive). And it's not crazy expensive, but it's not cheap either, so there are a lot of restaurant options at this price range. I'll definitely come back, I'm just not busting down the door."}
{"text":"I have dined as a member of the Over 50's Singles  group, also on an individual basis.The food has always been very good but if you arrive on days when specials are available be prepared for a real treat. I reveled in meals that were nothing short of sensational; highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was checking out the area and got starving. I was going to get a meal... Instead I had crab dip with homemade crispy chips (how could I not?!) I also had a Santan brewery Oktoberfest beer (2 of 'em) and all were delicious.  Seems like a local fave because everyone knew each other and then then I got to know everyone.  Jeff is great!   I'd go back and order real food like an adult next time. Everyone else was eating wings or a burger and loving it.  It was a tasty and positive experience. That's all."}
{"text":"Tanya was amazing!  She found out it was my birthday and surprised me with a chocolate brownie and vanilla ice cream! Absolutely amazing!  Food was phenomenal! ! Service was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome price, great service...it's funny cut its hidden so well in the area it's in, I've passed this place and never knew about these awesome burgers"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food!!! Best steak I've had in a while and the blue cheese salad dressing was delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I had the grilled vegetable salad for lunch. It was fabulous and would highly recommend it. This small restaurant continually puts out great quality and the prices are very reasonable. Recommend giving it a try!!!"}
{"text":"Open for breakfast on the weekends! I don't come here nearly often enough for lunch and dinner, so I was surprised when I looked at their website to see that they have a weekend breakfast menu. I kept it simple with an omelette (with brie, bacon, and sausage). It came with choice of toast and breakfast potatoes. It was really, really good, even if it was just an omelette. Same quality food and great service as I've come to expect here, but now for breakfast. I'll definitely be back to try the other breakfast menu items!"}
{"text":"Went out based on a recommendation by a friend we were not disappointed the hamburgers were delicious will be going back again"}
{"text":"13-North is an amazing little restaurant with a chef that delivers the BEST in soups, salads, brushetta, with the LOBSTER mac-n-cheese being my ultimate favorite.  This place somewhere where everyone can feel like they can \"duck out\" of their busy day and truly....relax.  They have a small outdoor patio with palm trees lit at night where again; allows customers even options for something hot or cold to drink...and continue to enjoy the dining experience.  I love their $6 Sunday burger platter which is...HUGE.  The staff is always attentive, and sitting at the bar is always a pleasure.  Wonderful place and one of my favorites in this area."}
{"text":"I love this local eatery and will always support the local guys over big box chains!  I have not had a bad experience here and have loved the food every time.  My only comment would be that they could add another vegetarian or pescatarian (fish) option or two.  I am a huge fan of the vegetarian wrap and the fish and chips (fish and chips not on the regular menu, but the specials occasionally).  The crab cakes are to die for as well as the bruchetta.  Will frequent this place again and again."}
{"text":"Being new to the area, I finally checked out this neighborhood restaurant. It was much more spacious and had better atmosphere than I had expected from the drive by each day. Lunch was great! The best NE clam chowder I've had in a long time! My burger was fresh--great char taste, good tasting and good sized side orders. Can't wait to check out the breakfast and happy hour. Super friendly staff-Shout out to Emily H-our waitress."}
{"text":"The food was okay and decently priced. I had the Build A Burger wrapped in lettuce with the house chips. Burger was average and the chips lacked flavor. I tried my friends sweet potato fries which were really good! My friends burger was burned (they cooked it on the fly because it somehow disappeared and didn't come out on time). Another friend never got her salad appetizer- think this was the waitress (see below).  Our server was polite but seemed annoyed that a group of 6 ladies stayed for more than 2 hours... In a practically empty restaurant. Wonder how she would have acted if it was busy?!?   Inside is nice and inviting. Patio looked like a great place to be when its cooler outside :)"}
{"text":"Excited about Shake Shack? Don't bother Thirteen North Grille has the best burgers in town!  Their menu has a lot of variety and all of their food is excellent!  From bar food to artisan salads to pasta, sandwiches and steak everyone will find something fulfilling and leave wanting to know when they'll be coming back for more!  The atmosphere is pleasing and quieter than most.  Great for date night, girls night or upscale family gathering.   Try it - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The owner also owns Stumpy's which is also a favorite of ours. The food is great and the service is too. Not bad prices either. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"This is my second time here at thirteen! My last visit was great! Food was great! As well as the service! From what I heard they have a dog friendly patio!!! How awesome! Would recomend this place to anyone in the area! They always have great lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Casual bar-type of place. Friendly service. Ordered the recommended burger with brie and sautéed onions. I loved it. Side salad and balsamic dressing. Fast, delicious lunch. A nap is recommended after eating there. Go there for their burgers."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I took a recent vacation to Phoenix, and decided to give this restaurant a try after seeing the good reviews. Our waitress was super nice and talked to us about menu questions, the restaurant itself, and even asked us about ourselves! She was extremely friendly and made our dining experience wonderful. I had the seared ahi as an appetizer, and it was to die for; it practically melted in my mouth! My boyfriend got the steak which he looked like he was in heaven while eating, and I got the shrimp scampi, which was different from any shrimp scampi I'd ever had, but was still pretty great. We skipped on desert because they serve large portions for reasonable prices. I would definitely come again if and when I visit Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Don't have enough good things to say about these folks! My wife & I are regulars there with our service dog, and we absolutely LOVE this place! The beer is amazing, the food is somehow even better! You have to try their Mac & Cheese, plus their brunch menu is AMAZING!   I can't tell you how great the staff is, they always treat us like we own the place, and could not be more attentive & helpful. This is our favorite bar out here!! You HAVE to try it out! They have Stella on tap!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Thirteen North is fantastic! Great food, great beer, friendly staff, and they only charge me $1 for suggestions."}
{"text":"I really love this place! I come here quite often with my family being that it's done the street from our house. The service is quick and friendly and we've grown seriously attached to our favorite waiter.   I always order off of the specials menu and have yet to be disappointed.  The food is always served fresh and hot! The portions are also pretty large, so I always end up with leftovers. This is a great place because their menu is diverse and can accommodate all types of eaters.   I definitely recommend this place to a local NoCenPho or anybody that may be in the area!"}
{"text":"This was one of our favorite neighborhood spots, but after our last visit that is no longer the case.  We have always sat at the bar and received great service.  On our last visit the service started out OK, but as the restaurant neared closing time (9 PM) service became nonexistent.  The bartender started taking down the bar one hour before closing service stopped and completely ignored our empty drinks. After waiting for five or more minutes, I asked if the bar was closed. As the bartender continued to clean, one of the owners who happened to be behind the bar helping himself to a drink happily tipped his glass to me and said in his best frat boy voice, \"the bar is definitely not closed\". He also completely neglected the fact that we had been sitting with empty drinks for quite some time.  We asked for our check and took our business elsewhere and don't plan on coming back.  Had one of the owners acknowledged the poor service this might be different.  If they are more interested in pouring their own drinks than keeping regulars coming in then it's not the place for us."}
{"text":"New favorite burger joint!  Bartender was awesome service the same and the good was delish!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday afternoon.  Normally I'd be wary about an empty restaurant, but it was in between lunch time and happy hour, plus I had a groupon so I was going regardless.  I drank a wheat beer.  Didn't even ask what brand but it hit the spot.  I started out with the crab dip; delicious!  Moved onto the Hot Mess burger; it was good, but maybe a burger with spicy cheese sauce isn't for me.  I definitely look forward to trying their other burgers."}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  Great happy hour, The mussels in white sauce for $6 were so good we had to order more. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Worst possible meal experience in the valley. Met old friends at this new place with great expectations.  Started with a possibly inebriated waitress and ended with an apology from the owner Larry. Our party of four arrived at 5:45pm when we were informed that they were out of most entrees and sandwiches. Eager to forge on, we picked our way through the menu trying to find something \"in stock\".  An hour later, we chased down the waitress to order more drinks which came quickly due to a great bartender. Finally, frustrated, we decided to leave. On a positive note, Larry was willing to engage in my feedback and admitted losing his chef at the last minute. From his response I think that he is earnest in making things better."}
{"text":"Not good for vegans for vegetarians. They don't serve breakfast on the weekdays which was why I went there. Not good for kids. Good for meat eaters who want a bar."}
{"text":"I had a long-time friend in town over the holidays and we chose 13 North because it was in a perfect location. Wow! We both had the daily salad special which was truly amazing! We were greeted warmly and did not feel at all rushed as we caught up over a long lunch. Our server was fantastic. Thank you, 13 North, for a delightful and tasty meal! I am looking forward to checking out their happy hour as they have a lovely patio and full bar."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch, had the hot mess burger, had Maria put the crispy fried jalapeños on the side, by the way she was fantastic, she also suggested the the roasted veggie salad, changed out balsamic dressing for blue cheese dressing, so glad I did because the blue cheese dressing had big chunks of blue cheese in it.  I found this to be the best burgers and the veggie salad was yum yum.  You must come here, everything is so fresh."}
{"text":"Food was great, very tasty. Burgers were large and well prepared. This place is a great value with the Groupon. I would definitely come back. Margaritas were strong and well prepared. The Apple cobbler for dessert was just okay. My only complaint is that the waitress was absolutely clueless. She got the order wrong multiple times and when it was time to pay was nowhere to be found. Other than that, this is a wonderful little restaurant."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered the cheese dip. I was okay. The chips were The only good part. My friends grilled cheese sandwich was not even melted. Come on! It's was like a warmed up cheese sandwich. she said the only thing that was decent were the sweet potato fries!! Therefore the 2 stars!!"}
{"text":"One of the best kept secrets in Phoenix, 13 North hits the mark for great food, and perhaps more importantly, hospitality. The staff bends over backwards to ensure your satisfaction, and prior to departing, will have made new friends. The food delivers, with the sliders, and Parmesan twirl great starters; and the jambalaya and walleye entrees amazing meals. Can't wait for our next visit - a fun atmosphere for any night of the week."}
{"text":"I was going to give them a few more stars for decent enough customer service and better than I expected decor, but I'm watching the waitress argue at length with a nice family of customers on combining a Groupon with the $6 burger specials they ordered from their waiter, and telling him she has to re-ring them as $8 burgers.  Bad customer service.  Down to one star!  The french fries are really awful.  Not juicy, very dry, and definitely overcooked.  They were actually inedible when they cooked off, as they became rock hard with no taste.  I'm assuming they're frozen, which explains why they had to cook them for so long and the lack of taste.  The Patty Melt's burger was overcooked and tasted too charred for my taste.  It was also bland, and salt and pepper didn't help much.  It was thick and perfectly round, like a frozen Costco burger.  The sourdough was good enough, though greasy.  The cheese was too salty when I tasted the bread and cheese alone without the burger.  The waitress was okay (a bit snarky at first, taking off the lemon from my water instead of getting me a new one), but even if I hadn't seen the Groupon fiasco, I cannot recommend this place when I paid over $11 for what I could get a much cheaper and tastier version of at Jack in the Box."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this neighborhood spot! Unfortunately the kids' chicken kabob was cold & chicken was dry, the kids' cheese burger was served w/o cheese & we ordered apple slices & got French fries. The grilled cheese I ordered was supposed to have bacon & tomato and was made with neither. The French dip my husband had, he rated a \"C\".   When we first sat down I was given the happy hour menu to pick a drink & was charged the full price for the drink. I asked the server to adjust the price & she told me the price depends on when the drink is rung into the computer...seriously I ordered the drink at 6:15 pm & happy hour ends at 6:30 pm. I was also charged for the cheese appetizer thing & I told the waitress I had a coupon free a free on from Yelp. She did take that off our bill and DID NOT adjust the price of my drink!   Needless to say, we will not be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here multiple times and I've taken several friends here for lunch.  It's been excellent every time and the service is always friendly and informative.  I guess it's not perfect judging from some other reviews, but you just can't please everyone every time.  It's great neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Ordered the Philly Cheese steak.  The meat seemed to be of high quality, but there wasn't a flavor explosion in my mouth.  I'm thinking they may have missed seasoning in it.  Sweet potato fries...YUM!    My wife liked her 3 cheese Mac and Cheese and the grilled chicken wedge her friend got was good too.   The staff were VERY attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I just left Thirteen North after having lunch there for the first time. I had $30 to spend via my Restaurant.com certificate and planned to pack some of my leftovers for dinner tonight.   Here's what I ordered: Calamari, Glazed Salmon (which comes with mixed veggies, garlic mashed potatoes or orzo pasta or side salad) and sweet potato fries.   What I received: A side salad, a piece of non-glazed and dry salmon (I NEVER told her I didn't want my salmon to be glazed) with a full plate of sweet potato fries.   I have friends that work in the restaurant industry and I also work in retail part time so I understand how people can get crazy about the things they spend money on. With that in mind, I really try to make it a point not to complain or ask for TOO much while dining.  But me + no food since 7:00AM = HANGRY. Today was NOT the day to mess up my order.  I just want my food, as I've ordered it. That's all.   My waitress, Jessica, was polite but when I asked her about the rest of my food she said she forgot my calamari and thought I only wanted fries with my salmon. At NO point did I tell her I didn't want the mixed vegetables or the orzo pasta with my food. She offered to have the veggies made, I said okay, but with my limited time due to my 1 hour lunch break and my extreme disappointment, I canceled it a few minutes later. She brought out my veggies anyways which I didn't bother to touch.   I literally paid $20 for a dry piece of fish (which was decent and I ate ONLY because I was very hungry and out of time) and fries (which I took with me to go because they were pretty good). I was visibly VERY upset. Jessica said she wouldn't charge me for the veggies and she didn't.  I'm usually a excellent tipper but I left her a $1 tip, wrote on my receipt why she only received a $1.     Customer service is everything to me. This was not a good experience. Never again."}
{"text":"All the food was very good. The service was great. I am giving it four stars instead of five because of the restaurants condition itself - It's a bit shabby.  We also used a coupon here and so was actually a great deal."}
{"text":"Ideally I would give this place 3 1/2 stars, but since half-stars aren't an option on Yelp, I decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt, in no small part due to the great service we received. We decided to try Thirteen North for a late Sunday lunch. We'd read good things about this place in Phoenix magazine and decided to give it a try.  The first thing I noticed about this place is that it was more busy than I expected for 2:00 on a Sunday. The second thing I noticed is that it is really loud. Part of what made it so loud is that there was a crowd of about 10 people at one corner of the bar who were watching a football game. My fault for visiting during a playoff game. Fortunately, when we arrived there were only a couple minutes left in the game, so the obnoxious crowd quieted down after a while, but while the game was in progress, i could hardly hear myself think. The vibe thus was more sports bar than I was expecting, which is fine, but they only had one little TV in the bar area that all the fans were crowded around. If you're going to put off a sports bar vibe, I think there should at least be more TVs around the place so that we could have watched the final moments of the game too, instead of just learning the outcome from the screams of the obnoxious crowd. (Our server, who was incredibly sweet, told us that it normally isn't so rowdy and attributed the obnoxiousness of the crowd to the fact that it was a playoff game, which is fair.)  Even after the game was over and the crowd had quieted down, the restaurant was still pretty noisy. Must be something about the acoustics of the building.  My husband and I decided to share the ahi tuna appetizer to start, and we were not disappointed. The sesame seed crust was the perfect compliment to the seared ahi, adding a touch of nuttiness. The accompanying sauce was also very good: kind of a soy sauce, but thicker, only not too thick. Also on the plate was some kind of carrot and squash slaw that went perfectly with the fish. I would definitely order that appetizer again.  We had literally just put down our forks after finishing the appetizer when our server was at the table with our food. My husband wanted to try the Sunday $5 burger special, and he loved it. It looked huge. I tried the veggie wrap, which was sauteed broccoli, squashes, and other veggies along with a smokey white cheese inside a tomato basil tortilla. It was pretty big. I got the sweet potato fries on the side (not salty enough for my taste, but that was easily fixed with the salt shaker), and between the fries and the appetizer, I was only able to eat half of my wrap. It was pretty good, nice and hot, but due perhaps to its size, it wasn't wrapped together very well, and so fell apart pretty quickly making it kind of messy. My wrap also came with a side of what appeared to be a sweet chili sauce, which struck me as odd, because the sauce seemed more like something to dip an egg roll in. But still a decent lunch.  Both my husband and I left Thirteen North feeling pretty stuffed.  Overall, the service was excellent--friendly, helpful server, and the food arrived very quickly.  The reason I would rather give this 3 1/2 stars than 4 is because the whole meal seemed relatively average to me. The ahi was very good, but I've had lots of good ahi at many places. My wrap was also good, but not anything mind-blowing. I will be back though, not just because it is close to my house, but also because I think it has potential. There was a mac & cheese on the menu that I would love to try. Also, another reviewer commented about the sense of community among the patrons and the staff, and I have to say I agree. We were probably there about an hour, and the majority of people who were there when we arrived were still there hanging out when we left. They seemed to just enjoy being there, which doesn't happen just anywhere."}
{"text":"Had a drink while I waited to take out dinner. Liked the environment. Prices are normal tor a bar and restaurant. Good selection of drinks and was treated well by both hostess and bartenders. Definitely going back for happy hour. I ordered a burger with fries to take home and it turned out really good and no mistakes."}
{"text":"I picked up my little local neighborhood paper and read a great review on this place.  Since, I am a foody and prefer to spend my money in a locally ran restaurant I choose to not make my crab and shrimp capelini, which I had planned on the day before and postpone it till the next night.   We arrive and were greeted by a young high school boy who sat us at a table near the window.  The food seemed diversed and had something for everyone on it.  The waitress tells us that they have only been open for 2 months.  I'm  thinking cool....I choose the 13 north blue burger and a house mojito.  When the burger arrives it was insane and awesome - when the mojito arrives it was truly the nastiest tasting mojito I have ever graced my lips on.  It tasted like soda water with a little ick.  I was looking forward to the taste of rum, sugar mint and the combination of sweetness, refreshing citrus and mint flavors, intended to complement the potent kick of the rum.  I walked it back to the bar because the waitress was texting on her smart phone and did not come back to check on us.  When it returned (supposedly) new and improved it tasted more of the same.  I told the waitress I would pass on the drink all together and move on to my lemon water and amazing burger. I take a bite and try to move on and realize that \"Oh, well, maybe I wasn't supposed have to drink tonight\"  When all the sudden me and I my companion here loudly the bartender say, \" I am not making him another mojito, I know my mojito's rock and are always fucking amazing\"; screaming  loud and echoing off the walls of this small little place that was almost empty.    I called the manager over and even though he comp our entire dinner he handled me and my guest like a used car sales person, wheeling and dealing with me to forgive his \"Bitching Bartender\" for her explosive and reactive outburst. As a person who knows excellent customer service you don't make excuses for your employees who scream cuzz words across the restaurant so everyone can hear them. To say the least we won't be back.    Now, on a good note:  The food we did have was very, very good, however its not hard to make a good burger.  My challenge to you would be to plop down at the bar and have hissy fit drama queen, \"Bitchy Bartender\" make you one of her \"Always fucking rocking perfect mojito's\".  And, if you don't like it send it back and watch her react and tell you that you are wrong and she is always right.  It's very interesting.  Steve:  If you believe this is the kind of person you want to work for you, then I am almost 100% sure your doors will be closed with the next 10 months.  Good luck 13 North Grille - you lost my vote and dollars!"}
{"text":"Bland Mac n cheese, ordered it with green chili and onions and had to dog to find any. Meat loaf too drenched in red chili sauce, uninterested waitstaff and fairly unprofessional. Drinks were good though. Pricey at $65 with tip for the experience. Also one dimensional menu. Won't be back. Addendum: we both got sick as well. Obviously without testing the food we can't say definitively it was from 13 north but we were both fine before. A yelper sent me this link. Explains why we got sick. this is probably why you guys got sick.... maricopa.gov/EnvSvc/OnlineApp..."}
{"text":"You MUST try the home made crab dip and home made potato chips.  Any salad here with blackened shrimp and the bleu cheese dressing is fantastic.  The best lemon drop of any bar in the valley.  We drive out of our way about once a month to come here even though we no longer live near this neighborhood.  We discovered this place when the wait at the nearby Vig was too long...and we're so glad we did.  Nice patio atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Found this through groupon.  Great happy hour specials..huge burgers..all around tasty food.  We definitely will be back!  It was worth the half hour drive!"}
{"text":"We came for the guest chef night, he is a friend of ours. I had never heard of 13th North, so this was our first visit.  It was cool to walk in the door of a place we've never been to see more of our friends.  Our entree was great (nice job, Mark!), but also the lentil soup, the arugula salad and the 13th North margarita.  The host, waitress, server... Everyone was super friendly and accommodating to a bunk of folks that were first-timers.  It was impressive how social and comfortable they were for such a high quality restaurant (would have expected more stiffness).   Not only were they friendly to us, they were a cohesive team; which contributed to a comfortable environment. We will look forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I had the $6 burgers with sweet potato fries here on Sunday and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!!  'It hit the spot' and that's what counts!!   This was our first visit and I have no real complaints....  The waitress was reasonably friendly, the food came out in pretty good time, the burgers were good (not amazing) .. the sweet potato fries were tasty...  (I really liked the sweet chilly 'dipping sauce') ...  overall, seems like a good little local spot!"}
{"text":"I travel very frequently for work and rely on Yelp to help find good places to eat. I came across this one, with a co-worker of mine, and decided to give it a try.   Initial greeting: We stood at the door/ hostess booth for several minutes before anyone noticed us...after that, we were seated promptly.   Drink order: My co-worker and I sat for well over 5 minutes, before the bartender finally left his post to come to our table and take our drink order. He explained that our waitress would be with us soon. We ended up putting in an appetizer order, while the wait began for the waitress.   Food order:  After 15 more minutes of waiting, the waitress finally showed up to take our order. Once the orders were submitted, it was a short wait for the food to come out. The bartender showed up again to refill our drinks, after the waitress went MIA again.   Food taste: Considering that I was hungry when I went in and starving by the time the food made it out...I would have eaten anything. However, the food taste was very good and recommended.   Overall, good food, but the length of time it took to be seated, get drinks ordered and get service in general...way too long. Not sure if this is the norm here, but if you've got time...good food at least."}
{"text":"Best turkey burgers and sweet potatoes fires in Phoenix. It's easy to drive by this little gen of a restaurant. It's on Northern with lots of traffic whizzing by. But slow down and pull in on 13th and E Northern. The staff is friendly and great service. They have a cute bar area if you just want to have a snack and drinks. I love coming here. They have more than burgers but like I first mentioned-best turkey burgers in Phoenix-so that's all I ever order. Hey 13North...bring back Blue Moon on tap and I'll give you 5 stars next time"}
{"text":"Coincidentally I came here on the 13th of August and they have awesome specials on the 13th (due to name 13 North)...I think the special was: buy any glass of wine and get one for 13 cents (or something similar to that). Anyway I had the large house salad with ahi tuna added on top; it was AWESOME! They do their tuna very well here! It is covered in tons of sesame seeds and lightly seared to perfection! I had the balsamic dressing with it and the salad was fabulous! I should also note they use GOOD Parmesan cheese that is shaved right from the block, YUMMY!   Our bartenders were very attentive (we sat at the bar). One of them could tell I was a hungry mungry, after I devoured half of the salad in about 5 minutes, so she brought me out a fresh basket of bread to have with my salad , so two thumbs up for service.   I have come here a few times since then and I would love to report on other menu items, but I just can't get passed the delicious sesame seed crusted ahi tuna salad! But, I can say all the other entrees I have seen look very tasty as well."}
{"text":"I like the food. So it's worth coming but the service is horrible. It might be the management or that they just can't find kind friendly wait staff. I'd rather drive a bit further"}
{"text":"Good service and food here! Nothing bad to report here. Had the philly and it was done right and flavorful."}
{"text":"What a great local spot! Have been here several times and have never been disappointed. Took a good friend here from out of town a few weeks ago and he still goes on how great the burger was and how awesome the prices are!  Make a visit you won't be disappointed!  Waiter also told me that the patio is dog friendly,which I will try when the weather gets better."}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  The prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is nice.  You can't beat the $5.00 burgers on Sat and Sun afternoons.  You can get meals like this, or you can get fancier dinners.  It's so nice not to have anotehr chain."}
{"text":"Finally! Another  decent restaurant in this neighborhood! Located at !3th Street and Northern, this location used to be an Italian restaurant which was a little pricey if memory serves me right. Now it's a family friendly sports bar...meaning it has a nice open space not necessarily focused on TV;s. We ate there fairly early on a weekday and got seated immediately. Our waitress was very sweet and accommodating...even going to the kitchen and bringing us a nice little sample of the poblano cream sauce which they serve on fetticine. I had the street tacos for an appetizer and the veggie wrap with sweet potato fries. Companion had a daily fish selection. Quite good. The veggie wrap was a little soggy with too many green bell peppers (it could have had red peppers and asparagus).  But it was better than I expected. Larry, the owner, came about and chatted making sure all was to our liking. I mentioned to him that we had been there a few weeks earlier and did not feel like it was welcoming for kids and a waitress had given us a rather rude reaction to our request for apple juice. He said he could not imagine why since he has two kids himself and they do have high chairs. I guess we will just make sure to bring our own juice! (BYOJ) I took an order of the afore mentioned poblano chicken fetticine home to hubby, It was very good but the cook was way too generous and the pasta was swimming in sauce. Either less sauce or add a lot more pasta.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great place with great food. I got a BLTA with extra crispy bacon. I was happy that my bacon was actually crispy! (That never seems to happen anywhere else when I ask for it!) My sweet potato fries were crispy, salty and yummy. Happy hour beers were tasty. I recommend checking this place out, if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great food. Nice atmosphere. Restaurant is small & I would imagine it gets real busy at peak hours. Wayne at the bar did a great job. 3 groups came in at off time & he handled the rush all on his own. Would have given 5 stars but a couple things we tried to order they were out of or didn't have all the ingredients. Our burgers were all very good. Hand packed & cooked exactly as ordered."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, amazing ambiance. We had the bruschetta and lobster Mac and cheese. D'lish!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family for lunch today and we had a very nice lunch! We were seated immediately and the staff were so friendly.  The restaurant is casual, clean, nice and pleasant.  We were greeted immediately after we sat down. There is a check in offer for a Parmesan tuillee which is delicious! It's basically a baked Parmesan crisp that you can dip in a delicious and flavorful green chile sauce.   For lunch I had the patty melt (added bacon) and sweet potato fries. The patty melt was really good--flavorful, hot, patty cooked perfectly. The sweet potato fries were very tasty and the perfect level of crispness. We all split the green chile chicken mac n' cheese and this was delicious! The green chiles bring this mac n' cheese to a whole new level. I highly suggest it! The only thing is that the food seemed very salty but everything was so delicious!   The staff were super friendly to us. They were very good with refills and very attentive--also just very genuine.   The price was very fair and they have a build your own burger deal on Saturday's for $6.   Overall, clean/casual restaurant, attentive staff, great service, fair prices and excellent food!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  Great service, had a table of 13 with split checks, no problem.  Dessert was dangerously tasty!  Kid friendly."}
{"text":"Two months later and the burger still remains solid. Perfectly burnt and White American and bacon were a good choice. Orange beer for 4 bucks and out the door for a total of $15 with tip for nice bartender. Bar gets crowded near end of burger special at 5pm."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch w/ family. Friendly service.  Food was very tasty and priced right. Large portions and very good quality ingredients. Salad dressing was fresh,  good and house made. Only had sandwiches but they were great."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, lunch and dinner spot.  They also make a mean bloody mary. Outdoor seating makes them dog-friendly. Service is excellent and prices are very affordable."}
{"text":"Good not great. This place is near my office so my coworkers tried it. Great looking interior, the waitresses were great but the manager seemed put out that we had to keep asking to top off our tea and water. The Cobb salad was good but not $11 good. I pay $10 at Chipotle and there's more flavor."}
{"text":"Had the Prime Dip. Very dry. Over priced.My wife and brother enlaw had burgers. I did taste the burgers and they were very good and cooked as ordered.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Me and my wife, Terri had an hour to kill and stopped in at 13 North.  Larry came over and spoke with us and he is quite the charmer. We had lemon drop Martinis and sliders. Great food, atmosphere and great happy hour. Definitely Recommend."}
{"text":"Went on recommendation from a co-worker. Was very pleased. Coming from MN I have not been able to find a place that serves walleye pike. I have now found my place for walleye pike, My parents visiting from MN said it was the best pike they have ever had. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday and it was empty. Only 7 regulars and it still took me 12 minutes to place my drink order at the bar. Took another 10 minutes to order chicken Marsala. Taste was marginal at best. I had to order another beer to wash down the taste which took an additional 15 minutes to get because the bartender wanted to talk with the old drunk lady all night. Save your time and money go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is a cute neighborhood  restaurant,  their  menu has a nice variety.  I tried their jambalaya  , the portion  was a little  small  but it had a lot of meat and good flavor  , the servers  were friendly  and helpful"}
{"text":"The gorgonzola burger here is awesome, and that alone is enough to draw me back for repeat visits. It certainly doesn't hurt that the staff is very friendly and there is a good beer selection. Prices are good for the quality and quantity of the food, and the restaurant itself has a very pleasing, casual vibe."}
{"text":"13North is pretty much amazing! The food is always delicious. I love the Mac N Cheese, Fish Tacos, and of course the Burgers are so good. They do a weekend special where the burgers are only $6!!! It's a half pound burger served with fries for 6bux. The burger special and weekend happy hour run from 11 to 5pm! ThirteeNorth is really one of those friendly neighborhood places. It kind of reminds me of that tv show \"Cheers\" ya know...where everyone knows your name. Many of the loyal patrons are greeted by their first names. I can see why people keep coming back, super friendly staff and amazing food. It's a total no-brainer, we will definitely be back for more goodness! Too good to pass up!"}
{"text":"Friendly people, but man, food is marginal at best and seating is not comfortable.  It's like they spent $500 buying furniture for the place.  Don't take your best guests here.  Not hitting the mark for me.  This was my second try, and that will be the last."}
{"text":"This quaint little neighborhood restaurant has been around for many year's.  However, it's been owned by a different owner for over a year now. Larry is the nicest, kindness, and accommodating, professional  individual you will ever know! I've had the privilege to know him for many year's. I think he's done alot of amazing new changes to the place. From the decor, to the food  ..... Fabulous!! The staff treats you like family, they're truly a bunch of lovely people.  I can honestly say that EVERYTHING I've eaten over the year's is absolutely delicious, and the service is spot On! As I write this, I'm enjoying a delicious Cobb Salad, just in time for a slimming  \"Summertime\" bod ..... check back on that one.  So get your rear in gear and get down there. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Actually the best food ever. Get the blue bayou, the pepper bacon is incredible. Julian is also the best and most attentive server I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Wedge salad. A lot of toppings, drenched in blue cheese, like what a wedge should be everywhere else."}
{"text":"The service and food was excellent! I had walleye and mashed potatoes that were perfect. We ordered as a table chips to share....if you like salty, this would be the seventh wonder of the world for you. There is a great dipping sauce to boot. This is a welcoming neighborhood pub with food that is  much better than your standard bar fare. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Not to many people were there but was a nice local place to have a decently priced meal. Would go again."}
{"text":"I think I have gone past this little gem a million times.  Sitting unobtrusively in a strip mall on the south side of Northern off 13th street (hence the name) is this wonderful little bistro style restaurant.  Our eau, Jeff, guided us through the menu, from great burgers (and each one can be changed to a turkey burger or a grilled chicken breast) or build your own, including a lobster or brie.  Each sandwich comes with your choice of home made potato chips or sweet potato fries.  Lots of choices for a fun lunch with the girls.  They have a full bar...and make a mean Bloody Mary.  We finished off with a warm chocolate brownie topped with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream, compliments of chef for a fun birthday.  There's definitely a reason to go back and try them for dinner.  These little places need to rely on word of mouth traffic...so help me spread the word."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere with outdoor patio.  We ordered prime dip and hot mess burger. Prime dip au jus was excellent.  Hot mess was good. We ordered a side of chipotle to dip our fries which was excellent. While I would like a 10 craft beer list on draught, the 4 beers were craft or Stella.  Wine list looked good. Service was really good. We didn't sit in the bar but the bar space looks fun. We will come back."}
{"text":"A friend invited me and I definitely missed it the first drive by. Also the name on yelp will only come up if you spell out 13 as thirteen. Duly noted. (Owners you should fix this)   The burger \"the hot mess\" - no comment please  Was delicious cooked as I requested medium rare and the Italian old fashion I ordered to drink went down like water on a hot day. the waitress/bartender was very attentive to our needs and I was happy with the visit. I'll be back at least a few times. Thank you Danny for inviting me to this hidden midtown gem!"}
{"text":"So, this restaurant sits next door to the business that literally says \"European Hoes\" on the front.  Yeah, Thirteen North's location is shall we say, a bit quirky.  In some ways its a wonder people can even find this place.  Set in a row of tiny businesses, each with signage begging for attention from those en route to or away from the 51 freeway, Thirteen North doesn't stand out in opulence or even its menu really.  But it suits the neighborhood well as a friendly hangout with a friendly staff and a super laid back atmosphere.  My Dad wanted to grab dinner and loved their burgers so I joined him here on a Thursday after work.  Despite its appearance as a small hole in the wall on the outside, the interior restaurant is surprisingly spacious with room for probably 50 or so inside and another dozen or so outside.  It was a light crowd tonight so my Dad and I go to it right away.  While my Dad raved about the burgers, one menu item caught my attention.  I haven't had Walleye fish since I lived in Minnesota over 11 years ago.  It was genuinely shocking to see that on a menu in Phoenix.  So what the hell, let's see if its as good as I remembered.    The Walleye came with a beef and veggie soup to start and the fish itself was accompanied by steam veggies and mashed potatoes.  The beef and veggie soup was pretty tasty and came with some nicely charred bread with butter and garlic.  A nice start.  When the main dish came out I was pretty impressed by the size of the fish.  I've seen some pretty big walleye back in Minnesota, but this was huge.  The fish was light and flaky just as I remember and the lemon butter sauce was a nice unobtrusive accompaniment.  For dessert I went with the brownie with ice cream.  This was a disappointment.  For starters, the amount of whipped cream on this was way over the top.  The intent of using a whole can of whipped cream was clearly to make the dessert look gargantuan, but it just looked silly.  The ice cream was fine, but the brownie itself was airy and bland.  I prefer a more hearty brownie with plenty of chocolate flavor (or even chocolate chunks for bonus points).  Aside from the dessert snafu, my first experience here was a pretty positive one.  Total price for all my food and a glass of water plus tax and tip came to about $28.  As mentioned earlier, the staff was incredibly friendly and my Dad and I felt completely relaxed here.  Would certainly come back to try more of the rest of the menu.  Maybe I'll pick up a European Hoe while I'm at it (kidding, probably)."}
{"text":"I drive by this place on my way to and from work, and for the longest time, I thought, \"What is this restaurant with the sleek logo, located in what appears to be a lower rent strip mall?\" I finally decided to check it out... Places named after their cross streets are all the rage, after all.  It's a small place, to be sure. Quaint. It's nothing more than a charming neighborhood restaurant.   It's unfortunate, then, that the food is so mediocre. It's trying to be good, but it falls short. I had the Lucky 13 burger, which is topped with a tasty mix of brie, bleu cheese, and grilled onions... All on a grocery store-quality bun.   When you think about it, it's really interesting that the difference between what would be an amazing burger and a completely underwhelming burger is just a bun. That's it.  The food isn't bad, but I really have no reason to go back here, with all the great options popping up around the N Central area."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places to eat! Great atmosphere but the best is the food! We were in there on a Saturday night and ordered the ribeye steak... It was cooked perfect! If you want great food cooked perfect this is your place! Our compliments to the chef."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great place to eat with a very relaxed atmosphere and freely prepared, mouth watering food that is prepared Only after you offer (no frozen meat or pre cooked items) then I highly recommend thirteennorth in phoenix off of 13th street and Northern. The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable while Larry the owner is a super friendly guy. I ordered the hot mess sandwich and it was Absolutely phenomenal and had incredible flavor."}
{"text":"Food was excellent... Large enough to share. Mom and I had the club sandwich. Split it. The sweet potato fries we awesome. And the dipping sauce was fantastic. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice dinner here last night.  The patty melt was great, as was the Mac and cheese.  Add in the good wine, good service and friendly staff and you've got a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Wish I could give them Zero Stars but I can't. My Co-Workers and I all ordered Different types of Mac & Cheese. The Lobster Mac & Cheese was Way Over Cooked and had a funky taste to it. Love paying almost $20 for something I will have to throw away.  I Would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This was our second visit.  We didn't think it could be better but it was!   Kelly was our waitress and seemed to be the only one working on this Sunday.   She didn't skip a beat.  She gracefully took care of 6 tables including  ours.   Our food was outstanding made with fresh ingredients and tasted made to order.  The music was a soft jazz. The other customers seem to be happy with their food, no complaints or trying to track down the waitress.   We live 2.5hrs away and defiantly worth the drive. When we check into yelp a pop up appeared and we received a free appetizer.  A pleasant surprise.   We will be back"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, even better service. The food, however was terrible. I had the open face steak sandwich which I didn't eat because it was so fatty it wasn't edible.   Because it is locally owned, I would like to say I would be back,  but that would probably be a lie. There are too many locally establishments in Phoenix to return to one with mediocre food."}
{"text":"Drinks are great! Service is very attentive and chill atmosphere. Didn't try food today just day drinking but so far sooooo good. Great SATURDAY happy hour."}
{"text":"Really fresh food . Huge portions . Awesome service . The owner came over and introduced himself . Would recommend this restaurant  To anyone !"}
{"text":"I was recently invited to lunch at This place. I had been once before and recalled the burgers being wonderful.   This time we had the prime dip sandwich and the Philly cheesesteak. Both were in small hoagie rolls making for a small lunch. The prime dip was served with au jus and horseradish and was very tasty. The Philly cheesesteak had about 1/2 of the meat served in the prime dip.  Ingredients were good, portions were small  We did see several people order burgers and they all looked very tasty and were huge.  I would return- perhaps for a burger"}
{"text":"The worst service I've received anywhere in a very long time. I went there for a happy hour as part of a large group. Our visit had been scheduled well in advance and fully anticipated. Yet the service was extremely slow and negligent. Some items were simply forgotten and never brought. And no apologies from anyone. My glass of wine never arrived. I eventually got up from the table and went to the bar to get it myself. Empty dishes were never cleared from the tables. No manager or owner seemed to be present, although it was a Saturday evening, and no one ever came out to check on us. Our waitress seemed to be suffering from a hangover and had a clear \"don't bother me\" attitude. And they added an automatic 18% gratuity to everyone's bill. What a nerve! I would not have given 2% voluntarily.  I give this place a 0 (zero) rating."}
{"text":"I tried the restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. First time was Saturday morning I ordered one full breakfast and another to go. The food took forever to arrive. No water nor coffee refills after my request. It was not even busy at the time. Second time I decided to do a takeout. When I got home both orders had items like missing. Since we did not have time to go back picking up the missing items that day the manager promised to send us \"restaurant credit \" in the mail. That piece of mail had never arrived. Needless to say we won't be going back. We will travel a little distance to other American restaurants that provide superb service."}
{"text":"Armed with a $30 Local Dines gift certificate ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ), I went here last night for dinner with a party of 4.  It was the 13th of the month which is the day of the month when they have extra super deals on certain things.  For example a few entrees were $13 and your second bottle of wine is 13 cents.  It was pretty busy and loud but we were seated right away and our waitress was fast and friendly.  Food was also delivered relatively quickly.  All the other tables around us were offered bread to start but we weren't asked and none was given to us which ticked me off.  We ordered a bottle of wine and a 2nd because, hey it's only 13 cents.  Then, for an appetizer we shared the calamari.  It was very good and perfect to share even though I could have eaten it all myself.  I loved the spicy sauce stuff.  I ordered the wedge salad for myself and it was not very good.  Well, it could have been very good had the thing not been warm.  They must of had the lettuce and other toppings out of the fridge for a few hours.  Bummer.  For my main entree I ordered the burger and it was excellent.  I loved the toppings and the burger itself was cooked perfectly.  I ordered the plain fries and they were just ok.  Nothing special.  I should have ordered the sweet potato fries or chips instead.  The only thing that seriously pissed me off was that our waitress refused to honor my gift certificate.  I was going to start a fight, but I was with friends and didn't want to be rude.  Instead I'm taking to Yelp to vent my frustrations.  Anyway, I sort of understand why I cannot use a coupon for happy hour stuff or a 13 cent bottle of wine.  What I don't understand is why I can't use my gift certificate for the other 80% of the bill which came from full price items?  I've purchased about 20 gift certificates over the years from Local Dines ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ) and this was the only place to give me a problem.  So, while I do highly recommend getting one, be prepared for a fight.  All-in-all it was a good meal and a solid neighborhood spot.  If I lived closer I might give it another shot, but the food and service aren't good enough for me to make the 15 minute drive."}
{"text":"lunch -- burger and sweet potato fries. real good burger and fries that were as good as i've ever eaten: light, thin, crispy, a nice seet/hot asian chili dip -- great! will go again soon."}
{"text":"You had me at the meatloaf! Better than mom use to make. Also tried the French dip. Super solid! Nice tight draft selection. Had the Scottish which was really good. The painkiller was a nice lunchtime cocktail. Not to mention the wings good and crispy, but then again I am a European Hoe for a good wing.  We will be back"}
{"text":"I called and asked if we could get the lunch special to go and the manager Jeff was a douche. So we ended up paying regular price and picking them up. Well the manger( JEFF ) was a complete A-hole. It wasn't that hard to tell us that the special wasn't available for take out. He hung up on me twice. Definitely not recommending this place to anyone. The food may be good but the service I am unimpressed with. From one business owner to another, get a new manager. I will be looking for a new location to host my holiday parties.  Ok so after I left this review the manager called me. Instead of trying to fix the problem, he attacked me verbally and said that I needed to take the review down now. I couldn't believe that he called me . I told him that this whole thing was petty, that if I wrote the review, it was because that's how he made me feel. I then hung up because at the time I was driving. He called and left a rude massage threatening me. He said that if I did not take the review down he would contact the authorities. Does anyone know how I could get ahold of the owner? We have our holiday lunch every year and decided to go somewhere else based on the over the phone experience."}
{"text":"A friend and I tried Thirteen North for dinner last night for the first time, and we were so pleased with our experience.   Service was very personable and engaging. We had conversations with most of the staff and it definitely added to the experience. The atmosphere at this restaurant is very ambient and inviting. Great patio area as well.   For dinner we both opted for seafood entrees. I had the pan seared Walleye pike and my friend had the salmon. We swapped tastes of our dishes and both were fantastic! Each entree was accompanied with a sautéed veggie medley and orzo. Yum yum! Dinner entrees also come with choice of soup or salad. All of this was under $20 each and well worth it!   Will definitely be returning to this great find. Hoping to try their breakfast soon as well because it looks very tasty!"}
{"text":"We just had to come back cause the original experience was so good. We both did the Saturday Build A Burger. Hubby got green chilies, I got green chilies with cheddar cheese. Both yummy, but ya know what, these burgers are sooooooo good they stand alone! !! No need for any garnish, just perfect plain. Most of the time,  I order garnish on the side because the burgers are just not that great and I need the add ons.  But, boy, these burgers are big, juicy, seared on outside and perfect -- best word for them -- perfect.  Ordered the sweet potato fries cause of all the Yelp recommendations. Boy, am I ever glad!!! Great dusting of salt with chili powder for a subtle bite, but pair that with the Thai Sweet Chili sauce and WOW! !! Best ever!!!  We're going for the Bread Pudding for dessert, so hold on for that review...  Well, now,  that is bread pudding! ! Hubby just remarked, \"Oh, wow, probably the best I have had\"  There ya go... another GREAT experience at Thirteen North! !!"}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend on Tuesday.  From the moment we left the car, as we greeted just upon entry, to settling the bill, the staff was amazing!  The meals were just as described on the menu, but, better than we expected!  I am going to go back again.  Local food, local owner beats chain locations anytime!"}
{"text":"A cute little gem. On our first visit, my fiance and I got some kind of fish dinner (good, not great), ahi tuna (great), side salad (great, they make all their dressings- try the blue cheese!) and sweet potato fries (AMAZING! I am a huge sweet potato fry fan, and these are hands-down my favorite. The dipping sauce is also great). Also finished with a very good coffee amaretto.  Next visit, we tried the 13north burger (again, AMAZING) with sweet potato fries (see above. Also eat them because once you do you will know that your life has been incomplete without them.) However, the mac and cheese was just okay. I was hoping for creamy and cheesy, but what I got was more oily and cheesy. I probably wouldn't order it again. On Monday most wines are $13 a bottle.   As for service, both times the servers were very nice and attentive, but seemed like they were new. The food is very good, but can be inconsistent. However, with some very awesome choices (did I mention the sweet potato fries?), nothing bad, friendly service, and decent prices, I'm willing to put in the detective work to find out exactly what the top dishes are."}
{"text":"This is a little hidden gem in an area I rarely frequent. Came down here with a buddy and voila, checked in to get the free Parmesan Tuile. This was something I have never experienced in my life. It was awesome, go check my pics. Here is where I get frustrated and gonna be an honest guy here. They said if I wanted the free app from my check in, \"I had to leave a review\" and I was like right now? So I said I would later and here it is later.   The food was good. It really was and I want to give it 5 stars but come on, you say you have to do a Yelp review to get the free app. That defeats the purpose of it all. And honestly if I was to give the review right then and there without even trying the food or letting my experience resonate, then I would have given it a 2...max. This is a grace review with the stars I'm giving. I mean come on guys, this isn't how Yelp works. Unless I'm fully mistaken on my purpose for being on Yelp?!?!? I didn't have time to do it right then and there, nor did I want to even if I did. And I have time now a few weeks later so here it is. This was insane and the more I think about it I want to give it a 3 for wasting this whole review on leaving a review to get a free appetizer.   Ok the parm was amazing and it is a must to get if you check in or not. I had the sliders and they were also good and the ranch they had was perfecto. The ambiance was eh, I give it a 3. Our waiter was super nice and so was the manager/owner. They did what they needed to do. I will honestly be back if I'm in the area, but it will not be first choice. Just don't ask for people to write a review to get an offer. It doesn't work like that and you will tilt customers out big time.   I know this all might seem crazy to an owner or someone reading, but it's the truth from my POV."}
{"text":"Last Night, I had less then one hour to relax before Working a Late Shift.   I called into the Restaurant and A Owner/Manager (most likely) was very nice reassuring me that He could have me in and out quickly.    I sat at the Bar and introduced myself.  He made sure that I was taken care of by both the Bartender .   I enjoyed 2 Vodka & Cranberry's.   Although, The Dinner Specials looked incredible, I ordered the Open-faced N.Y Strip Sandwich -  7oz with Swiss Cheese, Grilled Onions, Tomato and mixed Greens on French Bread w/ Dill Pickle Spear $12.00  which would be my 11PM Dinner.  The Steak was a True New York Strip and nice size portion.  It was cooked perfectly Medium rare.  I requested it without the house-made Chipotle Mayo or Habanero Mayo .   The French Fries were also great which I ate immediately before Work.  I will definately visit again.   Also, If you need a delicious Meal ToGo this Steak Sandwich far exceeds a Fast Food Combo for a few bucks more.   You may want to order it for a Romantic Picnic Meal just ask them to Cut the Sandwich in 1/4's or 1/2's. John Phoenix, AZ"}
{"text":"New favorite joint!  Great food and service!  Nice wine and beer selection too.  Angila the bartender is terrific!  Go check it out.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"OMG best meat loaf ever and the chorizo mashed potatoes that comes with are excellent. The mixed veggies  were great too. Service was excellent and the price is right, well deserving of 5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm a cheap bastard with expensive tastes.  So my reviews are geared toward getting somewhat \"foody\" dishes at what i consider reasonable prices.  With that said, Thirteen North gets one of my very rare 5 star reviews.  I only dined there once, for lunch.  It's set in a strip mall, and easy to drive by without noticing.  But inside, it's very nicely decorated for a great lunch or dinner place.  Relatively modern, clean, welcoming.  We ordered the chips with crab dip ($7).  Easily enough for 2-3 to share as an appetizer.  It was terrific, with freshly fried chips heavily seasoned with something zesty, similar to Old Bay seasoning, with a nice portion of crab dip.  Felt it was an outstanding value, and we cleaned the platter.  I next had their 13 North Burger ($10), cooked well done.  It was a healthy sized burger, cooked perfectly, with a nice bun.  The blue cheese really popped and gave it a terrific flavor, and the mounds of perfectly grilled onions complimented it nicely.  I was stuffed.  The french fries that came with it were fair, neither outstanding nor bad.    My lunch companion ordered sweet potato fries that came with a sweet chili sauce, which was a surprisingly good compliment.  Three daily specials for lunch all sounded great and were a very reasonable $8.  Look, when you can get away with $30 for two for a two course lunch and are nicely full and feel the food was upscale, I consider that a great value.    I will be back for lunch, and probably also for a casual dinner.  If I lived around here, this would definitely be a neighborhood gem, and on a short list of reasonably priced lunch or dinner rotations.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I am a picky foody as you can read from other reviews I've written about other places.  I will start with the vibe: very quaint but modern feel. I really enjoyed sitting at the bar and the staff was very professional. It's obvious that the other customers come often, and they do for a good reason.  Food quality and presentation: I had breakfast and I ordered the frittata  which was absolutely amazing and not at all greasy. The frittata was perfectly presented with a \"no fuss\" pico salsa on top and had a variety of healthy vegetables in side. On the side I had the potato casserole which was cut in a perfect square and tasted kind of like an au gratin...excellent. I also had a side of beans and they had a nice slow cooked flavor. My sister ordered the pancakes and they were very fluffy and tasty. I would order it all again.  Price: Extremely fair. You are getting gourmet cuisine for a low price and the environment is hip with a neighborhood feel. I can't wait to return for dinner."}
{"text":"So let me pose a question.  You go into an establishment for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  You order two of their \"$6 Burgers\" and two mimosas.  You get your food and drinks and you and your girl are content. Burgers are good, a little messy but its a burger so who cares.  Then as you are 3/4's through with your meal you decide that its time to take a fork to the rest of the burger and eat it that way.  So you take the bread off.  You grab your fork and take the mushrooms off and you see it...  A single curled hair in the mushrooms.  At this point I am completely done with everything.  Our server comes by and I let her know and she apologizes and says to me I will bring the check over.  She does, and doesn't even take the hair burger off the total.  So at this point I am starting to get upset and it is showing.  We get another server by the table and I tell her what happens and she looks at the plate and goes to the bar.  A couple minutes later our server comes back and tells me \"we're taking $3 off your burger\".  Now I am amazed I didn't say something when she said that but honestly I was more stunned than anything else.  Why would you not offer to take the entire item off of my check?  Why would I even need to ask that?  Common sense and good business do not go hand in hand.    Lets be honest, say I am two bites in and I find a hair, what would they offer to do?  Most likely they would offer to bring me a new one to which I would have declined because I do not want hair in my food and because of that I am done with my meal and have lost any semblance of an appetite.  So for them to charge me half price for a burger that had hair in it is beside me.  Its a shame to, I have a restaurant.com coupon for this same restaurant and now it will be thrown in the trash because I am completely done with this establishment and will not go back.  Way to go Thirteen North Grille for a horrible dining experience and for completely turning off a returning customer from ever wanting to support your local restaurant again."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast and thought the food was ok. Not great but the server (woman in her late 20s) was so slow in getting our drinks and once she got help she still completely got our order wrong. I understand the wait to get served or drinks and for somebody to come get our order. But when she came to get our order she had already received some help from I think the owner and still got our order wrong. The older gentleman was nice so we decided not to say anything but not sure if we would return."}
{"text":"Amazing sliders! To die for. Great neighborhood place to go for great food and a comfortable atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch today and was extremely satisfied with the food, service and overall atmosphere.  The restaurant is spacious, yet has the right amount of tables to provide an intimate feel.  The lights are dimmed even during the day.  I was seated immediately and the waitress provided me with a listing of happy hour specials.  Most of the specials cost $5 with exception of the seared ahi tuna.  I had a $25 dine in credit so I ordered quite a bit of food since I was alone.  I started out with a pasta dish with sirloin tips in a creamy wine sauce.  It was simply amazing.  It came with a cup of New England clam chowder and bread; both excellent.  I still had some funds available so I tried the ten chicken wings.  I must say that these wings may have been the best wings that I have ever eaten.....and I have some experience eating wings!  Next I had the seared ahi tuna.  It came with a soy dipping sauce, a wasabi cream sauce and ginger.  I did enjoy.  The ahi was cut and seared correctly and the sauce was a unique compliment.  Overall, Thirteen North was my finest dining experience in at least five years in Phoenix.  The prices are reasonable, service is excellent and the ambience works.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Sooo good. Good sweet potato fries. Good Mac n cheese with bacon and mushrooms!!!  Honey garlic wings too!!"}
{"text":"We drive this place pretty much everyday and kept on wanting to check it out.  Now I'm disappointed :(.  And we're not even picky!   We ordered Fries Calamari as an app and it was completely tasteless, it was like chewing a rubber band.  Per the waitress recommendation I order their Prime Dip, it was not bad, simply not as good as advertised, hence the 2 stars  My wife ordered the Turkey Club, it was big and filling, but the veggies (lettuce, tomatoes, pickles) seemed and tasted as if they were cut a week ago, not fresh at all.  I'm giving it 2 stars because the service was that bad and the prices are descent.  Sad to say I won't be coming back, specially since it's almost walking distance from home."}
{"text":"The 13 North Grille is a really nice little casual neighborhood restaurant. This is a casual restaurant with a full bar. They offer a long list of happy hour specials and offer a nice American Food Menu with lots of variety. The owner was friendly and welcoming and our server also was very professional and gave us the best service I had anywhere in a long time.  We started with the Parmesan Tuile (that at this time was complimentary with a Yelp Check in). It's a TOWER OF CRISP CHEESE! It made a great presentation and came with a very tasty poblano dipping sauce. It was pretty neat...and different. I wondered what was coming next.  We added on tossed salads for $2.@ The salads were made with fresh mixed greens and the dressings we used were tasty. I added some of the parmesan crumbs from the tuile to my salad for fun.  For dinner I tried the Pan Seared Walleye Pike. It is priced very reasonably on the menu for Walleye so I know what kind to expect. The walleye was cooked nice till it was flaky but the skin was left on before dipping the fish in a light coating so the skin got soggy and is not yummy to eat. This fish can be elevated many different ways. One way might be by removing the skin or pan searing on the skin so it is crisp. My plate came with fresh summer vegetables and a good size mound of tasty mashed red potatoes garnished with parmesan cheese.  My husband had the Seasonal Meatloaf that came with fresh seasonal vegetables and mashed red skin potatoes.  This is a nice neighborhood restaurant.   The food I tried was sort of homestyle like a relative prepared it. A-OK for the price point.  Prices are reasonable and portions are large."}
{"text":"Love this place. Me and my husband go there alot and is definately a favourite local.  Great food, great prices and we love Terri the Bartender.  She makes the best Margaritas in town."}
{"text":"Yelp wins again! Heading home from the airport, tired and grumpy, my hubby and I were undecided on dinner. The burger and honey garlic wings were delicious. The hostess, owner and waitress were all very kind and helpful too. Great find!"}
{"text":"I stop by Thirteenorth every now and again on my way home from work.  I've noticed a new manager around who is very friendly and energetic and will always stop by for a quick hello when he sees me.  In the months since this change, morale seems to be extremely high which has created a wonderful environment for a meal.  The food is simply as good as it gets.  Highly recomended"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been dissapointed with the food. I had Salmon with spicy Asian sauce. The sauce smothered the Salmon flavor. I couldn't even tell what I was eating.   My friend had the Prime Dip. It was more bread than anything. Not kosher!   The server was very good. He was pleasant, checked on us many times. He has a laugh you can't forget.   Whatever changed, please change it back."}
{"text":"We went for the weekend breakfast. It was super yummy! I recommend getting a side of biscuits and gravy, they're home made with a little spice, very unique. The waitress was very sweet and attentive. They have great breakfast drinks like Bloody Marys and Mimosas."}
{"text":"Omg.... this place is awesome we had wonderful service the food was so good and Marie our bartender was marvelous.  We met Larry the owner,very nice guy. This place was the old Avanti's that was here forever. Atmosphere is is casual but warm, old blue eyes playing, lovely!"}
{"text":"If you want to go where everybody knows your name...A great neighborhood bar restaurant. If you haven't been since chef Chris took over then you should come back and try it again. The staff is super friendly and I haven't had a dish yet that wasn't great. Super comfortable atmosphere. You can't beat the chicken quesadilla for $5 during happy hour. Well you could but you would need a big stick. Build your own pasta on Tuesday's is a favorite. One of best turkey burgers I've ever had. And you have to check out Dinner With Dave that usually happens once a month. I had a blast last week dining with new faces enjoying great food and wine pairings. One of my favorite places to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner tonight-my hamburger was excellent and my son's chicken linguini dish was also excellent. We topped it off with a fabulous brownie sundae-with a surprise in the middle. This place is really beautiful and had a great atmosphere with great service.  Recommend this restaurant strongly."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place when trying to find something to eat around my neighborhood. The outside could use a little something to make it stand out more. It's tucked in a corner spot in it's complex. I've lived right down the street from this location for a year now and never noticed it. I chose to sit outside because of how dark and gloomy the interior design is. My boyfriend got 'The Hot Mess' and I the 'Bayou Burger'. The burger patty itself could've used seasoning and cooked to the temperature we asked for. Well done will never be able to pass for medium rare. If it weren't for the toppings on the burgers, house made chips, & hot wing sauce... it could've been a complete bust. I MIGHT give this another try, no promises."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a great rating but what happened at the end of the meal won't allow me to.  Good food, good service.  However, we were approached by the bartender at the end of our meal and asked to keep our children quiet.  Keep in mind that the adults had to speak in very loud voices to be heard over the music!  Our children were actually very well behaved (and I would be the first to hop all over them if they weren't!).  It was a very disappointing end to the evening."}
{"text":"Try the chicken poblano pasta!!! Yum! Don't forget to check in yelp and get the parm tuile. Friendly small neighborhood place, good food, good value."}
{"text":"The perfect sesame crusted tuna on my salad and a French Manhattan (a Manhattan with some Chambord mixed in) that will keep me coming back for more! Fair prices as it is but if you want to save some dough, keep an eye out for 20% off coupons in North Central News and specials on the 13th of each month!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped into this location tonight for dinner. It's a small locally owned business with a nice atmosphere. It was a little dark with mood lighting. Our server Kelly was friendly and very honest when we asked her about the food.   The crab dip was ok there was shredded crab in it had some crab flavor. I think it could have used a little more crab and some old bay myself but that's probably personal preference. The home made potato chips were thick, crispy, lightly salted and tasted good.  We both ordered the Frisco Patty Melt. I got regular fries and my wife chose the sweet potato fries. The burger was cooked a great medium throughout with just the right amount of seasoning. It was nice an juicy when you bit down into it. The peppered bacon I added was a good balance of bacon, thick cut, and hint of pepper so it was not overwhelming. The mushrooms tasted great as well. The sweet potato fries came with a sweet Thai chili dipping sauce which my wife really enjoyed.  We also tried the apple cobbler dessert. This was a bit of a disappointment compared to the rest of the meal. Its made in house and is apple cobbler made in ceramic ramekins topped with vanilla bean ice cream. This is not a dish I believe should be served COLD. Most of the apple cobbler or style desserts are made warm. The cold cobbler with the cold ice cream made for a weird mixture. We each only eat half of the dessert mostly the ice cream which was good. The apple cobbler was a swing and a miss in my opinion.   Overall it was a good visit and the main meal and appetizer was good, the service was great, and the only let down was the dessert. We would visit here again if we are back in this area."}
{"text":"Great happy hour with a friendly bartender named Wayne.  TV showed sports, the crowd was mostly locals and the menu had some good selections.  We tried the quesadilla with homemade salsa - yep, homemade.  The salad dressing is also homemade and is a must try.  Will definitely come back and try out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Wow! One of the best burgers I've had in Phoenix, and I'm a burger snob!  I never noticed this place, until stuck in traffic today, with a growling belly. Walking into Thirteen North, I could see plenty of seating, a bar and kind of upscale decor, also some sweet 80's jams were playing. I was sat relatively quickly and brought a menu and my drink order.  Glancing at the menu, there were so many items that made me salivate, but I decided to focus on the burgers. All unique takes on the traditional hamburger, including the Pizza Burger with pepperoni, smoked mozzarella and marinara. I decided on the Hot Mess burger, an Angus beef patty crowned with jalapeno cheddar sauce, fried jalapenos and crispy fried onion strings. For the included side, I chose sweet potato fries.  When my plate arrived it was massive, my burger overflowing with tasty toppings. A stack of fresh pickles, red onion, tomato and shredded lettuce sat beside the burger. A generous portion of perfectly cooked sweet potato fries with a chili sauce (made in house) nestled in the midst of it all.  First I dove into the sweet chilli sauce with a fry, it was amazing, full of flavor not heat, and paired the sweet potato blissfully. Next a bite of the burger, the cheddar sauce was tasty, the crispy jalapeno had great texture and the onion straws made for a prefect crunch before sinking into a very flavorful Angus patty.   I cleaned my plate and sat with a very full belly while talking to my friendly server Wayne. The portion was large and all that for under 10$ a great value. Honestly I can't wait to be hungry again so I can try something else. They have delicious looking appetizers, chicken and steak wraps and complete dinner options as well.   Well done Thirteen North, truly a hidden gem amongst a rotting strip mall."}
{"text":"Went the 13 North on the 13th of October, so on the 13 the of each month drinks are buy one, get a second for $0.13, basically 2 for the price of 1.  The burgers are phenomenal, a tip I may suggest, order med rare if you like med.  I suggest trying the different aiolis they have to offer.  Wings are fantastic and they have craft beer to go with them, an IPA called hop rising on draft at 9.8%. All dressings are homemade so they are delicious! The lettuce wedge is scrumptious with large amounts of crumbled bacon...the brownie sundae and crème brulé are homemade and delicious!"}
{"text":"Nice little pub. Great steak for the money. 18 bucks for a flat iron cooked just right. Friendly service.  Very comfortable"}
{"text":"Great beer paired with a delicious burger and served up by friendly staff.  Double IPA on tap, awe hell yes.  The burgers did not disappoint, great options to build your own burger or mac n cheese.  The server and bartender won me over though, great attitudes and fun to chat with."}
{"text":"My co worker and I came here for lunch on a Wednesday and it was bad!!!!! It's not a big role to begin with and they only had 2 servers. It was really bad service!!!! I had the special which that day was the hot ham and cheese with bacon and fries. My meal was very plain nothing to write home about. Definitely will not be going back here. Bad service is the worst at restaurants!"}
{"text":"We have been to ThirteeNorth a few times now and have wanted to wait until writing this review, just to make sure we were accurate.  Well, we were!  This place is just what the North Central area has needed for a very long time.  The food and service are exactly what you would expect from a restaurant.    You are greeted right when you walk through the front door (usually they open the door for you) and you are promptly given a table or a bar seat (if you are lucky enough to be there at the right time).  Your beverage order is taken immediately and the dinner and specials menu is to die for.  We have had the Steak Wrap; Delmonico Steak; Prime Rib Sandwich plus various appetizers and salads and all have been fabulous!  We are people that love to dine at the bar so that we can people watch and have conversations with others.  The bar staff are some of the best that we have seen in years.   The young lady with the long dark hair knows how to serve a drink.  She knows how to make whatever you want and always serves it with a smile on her face.  The owners are eager to learn what you like and don't like.  I believe that ThirteeNorth will be around the North Central area for quite some time and I am very happy about that."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. It's a local business, everything that I want to spend my dollars supporting. I came in with a groupon certificate. I like the low lighting and the atmosphere however, the noise level is pretty high and that detracts from the atmosphere. While carpeting the place would solve the problem, the floor in there is SO awesome that while it contributes to the noise level, it is too cool to cover with carpet....so I guess we'll have to live with the noise. I can't fault the service one bit, our server was wonderful and very attentive. The food however was a bit disappointing. It wasn't bad but I guess I had really high expectations that unfortunately weren't met. I had a New York steak that was a bit on the dry and tough side. It wasn't the worst steak I'd had by a long shot, but it failed to impress. The best thing about my meal were the sides. My mixed greens were great and the garlic mashed potatoes were the highlight of my main. This place has promise and while I wouldn't necessarily make it a point to return, I would really like to see places like this succeed.The service was definitely first rate and the overall enthusiasm of the staff is apparent when you walk in the door. If I find out that they've improved their mains a bit, I can definitely see myself coming back again."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant this evening.  The decor is  not anything extra ordinary. Service was polite and not too intrusive. Gave us time which we like when we go out. Dining out should not be rushed. We chose this restaurant because they serve Walleye, a fish not found on menus in Phoenix normally. The clam chowder was very good, the salad also good. We both had the Walleye - we liked it. The portions were very good. It is a restaurant is in a strip mall. Clearly it is a neighborhood restaurant/sports bar. There are some other items on the menu that looked interesting. A return trip is in order in the future."}
{"text":"In our neighborhood and now our go to local haunt! Great, consistant, friendly staff and talented chefs. Love the specials, love the burgers! Not the least expensive place, but fair priced. Can get loud, but worth every visit. We've probably tried the entire menu with few let downs. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've tried so many dishes and they never disappoint! But I would say my favorite is the weekend breakfast and amazing Bloody Mary! The atmosphere is warm and friendly and the owners make you feel at home and welcome. You have to try  it! Neighborhood ambiance with Fantastic menu choices."}
{"text":"Great food, nice wine and beer selection. Happy hour is a great deal. Mussels and clams in red sauce are soooooooo good. (sometimes I get 2 orders) This is a cute little neighborhood secret...."}
{"text":"I live right down the steet and went many times with my kids.  The last time I went my son and I got the French dip.   We both didn't eat any of it because it was so bad.  Hi do you mess a French dip up like that.  Never again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant. Support small local business! Great food and very accommodating to any allergies or preferences."}
{"text":"2nd time INDEED was a charm!  Went in w/kids on a Friday nite, we were  seated immediately in the upper bank.  My son had a turkey burger, daughter had the Mac & Cheese, and I had a salad...all were really nicely presented and tasty!   Will be back :)"}
{"text":"I visited your Thirteenorth Grille for the first time today.  The food and service were outstanding.  There is not enough positive feedback that I can provide regarding Terry and Wayne, Bartenders/Servers.  Terry and Wayne are extremely dedicated team members who exceeded my expectations.  I highly recommend visiting Thirteenorth Grille.  Thank you."}
{"text":"My first time in this restaurant, which it's a surprise to me because my wife and I lived so closed to it, and we are always looking for local restaurants. Well, first we just walked in, and for my surprise it was pretty busy, it's a local place, so there was a lot regulars there. Which to me is a good sign. We were a party of 3, the host told us that it was going to be a little bit of a wait. We want it to stay, so we did. Not even 10 minutes passed by someone went to get us at the door and asked us if we wanted to sit down by the bar, we said yes. It was a very good table by the bar. They were very courteous, amicable, and very good service. We ordered the Calamari, it came with a really good sauce, two different ones, good portion. We had some drinks as well, and on Friday they served Fish and Chips, which it was what we order, (we split our meals because the portions are usually really big). I will come back to this place, I love it..."}
{"text":"When a restaurant manager says \"Of course we can make a grilled cheese sandwich for you, even though it's not on the menu.  We have cheese and we have bread.  What type of cheese would you like?  What type of bread would you prefer, sour dough or wheat?\"  I am forever sold on this place.  Customer service lives and thrives at Thirteen North !!!  Chili Chicken Mac and Cheese was very, very tasteful, while entirely different than I expected.    Beverages were refilled before we knew we wanted more.  I will go back to try the Ahi Tuna salad.  Long live excellent food coupled with divine service!"}
{"text":"Thirteen North is that place, which must appear in travel guides of Phoenix area. It's cheap, delicious and here you can get something to go, but it's not classic junk food, but something, which is worth to try by locals as well! I think everyone can find something fulfilling here. Steaks, sandwiches, pasta, salads and delicious bar-all those and even more you can find here. I like this establishment due to its quiet and pleasing atmosphere. Thank you for such upscale family gathering place!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever had a bad experience at 13 North. Usually the food and service is extra good but today...No. We went for breakfast and was extremely disappointed with the food and service. Waitress was just inattentive and and didn't seem to know what she was doing. First cup of coffee almost lukewarm. Not good. Place wasn't busy but food took a really long time to show up.  My table mates food was fresh and hot but mine was cold. Had to send it back. Other customers were having to go and get their own toast from the kitchen. Will be going back there very soon because the food and service at dinner time during the week and on the weekends is great. Breakfast? Not again."}
{"text":"Eh...it was ok.   When we first arrived it was during lunch time and there were a bunch of \"suits\" eating lunch. That seemed like a good sign since we had more than $20 for lunch and these guys looked like they did too.   After looking over the menu, nothing seemed out-of-the-box. Seemed pretty standard fare. Mind you, they all looked tasty. We ordered the salmon flat bread (which was LOADED with creme fresh, making the dish glucky). Also, the sliders with sweet potato fries and chili dip (fries seemed generic and I swear they buy their chili sauce at Safeway). Lastly, the spinach salad (pretty good sized salad & tasted good too).   But, the ultimate part of the meal, which really ruined my desire for ever going back there, had to do with a glass of Stella Artois. The waitress asked which size we wanted - 16oz or 22oz. We asked for the 22oz size. She brought it out in a regular glass. Apparently, this type of beer comes in a very specific glass. I didn't know this, but my husband did. To my embarrassment, he asked for the correct glass for his beer. She explained that she had noticed the incorrect glass but didn't think they had the correct size of glass needed for the 22oz size. Since my husband and I were going to share the beer, we told her to bring out the correct glass and we would just pour the beer into the correct glass and leave the remaining in the current glass that I would then drink. She said that she would take care of it and took the beer back to the bar.   This time she returned with an actual Stella Artois glass of beer.  She explained that she \"didn't think the beer would have fit, but it did! Yay!\" (Her words) Because this seemed jenky, we double checked to make sure she had filled the glass with the 22oz that we had asked for. She said \"absolutely, yes, yes\". But, my husband and I weren't buying it. Awesomely, on the glass, it shows a measurement of where you are to fill the beer  - 40cl. We checked on Google to see what a conversion would be into ounces. Turns out 40cl is not 22oz, instead it is 16oz.   We called this to her attention and she said \"oh yeah, i was gonna change the price to the 16oz size.\" What? Did you not hear our order? Did you not confirm 5 minutes earlier that it was a 22oz?  Super shady.   Often times I think our tattoos give off the impression that we are trashy and somehow have never been to a restaurant before or (in this case) can't do math. Which is kind of what I felt happened here.   So, with the waitress and the beer situation coupled with a lackluster array of food... I wont be headed back. Although the aloof homeless man who runs the restaurant did come out and asked how we were. Cherry on the cake for me!  Not one of our better lunches."}
{"text":"The food is good, very good and prices are reasonable, BUT on Mothers Day the service sucked.  The resturant was full granted, but there are not that many tables in there and nobody was at the bar.  What looked to be two managers were useless, didn't do anything to help, the bus person didn't bus tables or help and the waiters ignored the customers and spent more time chatting with each other at the register than paying attention to their tables.  We had a table of 5, and the food was brought out in three seperate trips, and we ordered straight off the menu. Extremely slow.  My god, if its a holiday gear up.  I'd go back but only if it wasn't busy,"}
{"text":"I love this place! I met a friend and took two of my dogs. They have a very dog-friendly patio. First the waitress brought a water bowl, then she brought the menu. Sold!! The food was amazing and cooked well. I ordered a medium rare steak and it wasn't overcooked! Service was great. My friend loved the calimari and the dogs loved their fries! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area decided to try out TN because it was close. Interior nice and clean modern welcoming patio is cute. I came during happy hour and ordered the seared ahi tuna the sliders and sweet potato fries. Food was delicious fresh cooked to perfection flavorful and presented beautifully. My only critique would be that the waitress had to ask me what was in a vodka press but I didn't mind and the drink was perfect she was very helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"I have been here several times over the course of a year.  The food is really good, great service.  One of the best hamburgers I have ever had.   The macaroni and cheese is to die for, so leave the diet behind."}
{"text":"CLOSED. Now a Taco Mich location."}
{"text":"Service is Amazing and the food is beyond delicious!! Lean Turkey burger is now my favorite hands down in all of Phoenix area! You can't go wrong for a relaxing five star meal with a hip low key environment I would highly recommend to anyone! There is something on the menu for any palette!"}
{"text":"What an amazing find! Fantastic food made fresh each meal. Service was wonderful. We took a friend here from Seattle and she enjoyed every minute. We will be back for sure to try all menu items. Love local spots!"}
{"text":"My mother-in-law invited me out to Thirteen North a while ago for happy hour when my husband was out of town.  Northern is a little bit farther than I normally like to go for happy hour but I made an exception.  I was so glad I did.  First, the place was packed.  Second, their food was wonderful.  I specifically remember the mozzarella and tomato bruschetta.  I'm not a huge fan of tomatoes but I liked this bruschetta.  Our waitress was really helpful and attentive even though the place was packed.    The thing I do remember is that on that day - the 13th of the month -  they had a crazy special.  You buy a bottle of something and get a second bottle for 13 cents.  That's right.  Thirteen CENTS.  And our waitress let us take the second bottle home after we had opened it.  I hope this special is still running because I'm dying to go back."}
{"text":"This was the type of restaurant that we always look for but don't always see. We found it by chance and had such a great experience! The calamari was so delicious! We got the salmon and steak and they both were melt in your mouth gooooood! The waitresses were all so nice and sweet! One said I looked like a \"movie star\" haaa I have told many about this place and will for surly be back again!!!"}
{"text":"I had a good lunch here this past Saturday thanks to I think a Monsoon Deals coupon (locally owned) .  Service out front was friendly and  very attentive without being intrusive.  Our glasses never got dry, and that's an accomplishment in itself the way I drink.  My chicken wrap was will-filled and the sweet potato fries done well.  My companion did the weekend build-a-burger special with the same sweet potato fries and a cocktail.  Inside looked cool and inviting but under the shade, out front was quite comfortable.  Somewhat hidden by patio landscaping, I'd probably never have stopped but for the coupon - but I would go back again.  It's not really on my way to or from anything, but I'd make an effort to try a few more things on the menu, though I'll have to watch the prices as lunch, even with the weekend burger special and me drinking water, came to what I thought was a slightly hefty $36 for the two of us before the coupon.  Indoor ambiance dark and woody with polished concrete floors, brightened by large plate glass spanning the entire front of the restaurant tucked in this little strip center beside a defunct camera shop, and some doors down from Stumpy's Pizza, which has the same owner.  Watch for specials, both food & drink on the 13th of every month, including 13 cent cocktails, and check out the entire menu at: http://www.thirteenorthgrille.com/menu"}
{"text":"I am a fan. The location is in a strip mall so (as an out of towner) I passed by it the first time. So glad I turned around! I entered and was immediately greeted, when I said I would like to order to go the friendly waitress handed me a menu, let me sit wherever i wanted, and offered me water while I made my decision. She even put it in a to-go cup! I ordered the mac-n-cheese with no add-ons, and the prime dip. Best.mac-n-cheese.from a restaurant.EVER!!! I only ate half because it is such a generous portion. Prime dip sandwich was equally amazing. Fresh au jous that was NOT salty, and the sweet potato fries - yum! Half the sandwich and all the fries rounded out my meal.  I hope to go here again before my vacation ends, because I REALLY want to try a burger~"}
{"text":"What a great experience! The waitress was on top of her tables. Above and beyond. Had the french dip sandwich and it was one of the best I've had in a very long time. The decor inside is modern. They have outdoor seating as well. The sweet potato fries are awesome and you can't help but keep eating them!"}
{"text":"This place is Forkin great! Extream Chil atmosphere. Very laid back cool vibe! You don't even realize that your in a store front/strip mall. Chef & owner operated, I believe by the same folks that own Stumpies. All fres!, All tasty!! basically.... It's All Good!!! Just a bit pricey, if your not use to real food made by real Chefs, but I don't think you'll be upset paying your bill. Shop smart, take a friend and remember to share, portions are generous. I had a prim rib beef sandwhich, w/some great aujus, got a side of garlic aioli....50cent more, came with lots of choices, nice big plate of food w/salad like $10BUCKS Great wine & beer selection and on the thirteenth of every month, by on galss of wine get the second for just .13CENTS!"}
{"text":"It was just ok.   We went here on Saturday night for the first time, I drive past it every day on my way to and from work and wanted to finally try it out.   It was fairly quiet in there and there were a bunch of wait staff just standing around at the edge of the bar.   Our waitress was....odd. She didn't seem very happy to serve us. Asked us weird questions and then would just stand there and stair us down. When my husbands steak came out, he asked for steak sauce and she acted HIGHLY offended. Like seriously.   I got the egg plant parm and the eggplant was rather tough. We got the house made chips with crab dip. The chips were RAD the dip however, was left almost untouched, it was sooo not good. If they switched the dip up to something else or heck did something like Corbin's does they would have a great app on their hands!   Would we go back? If someone invited us and that's where they wanted to go, then yes...but to pick a place on our own and want to go there...no not really."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place. The food was excellent from the appetizer to dessert. I really enjoyed the steak wrap, especially because of the Chipotle Aioli. It made the meal. Yum!"}
{"text":"I ordered take-out from Thirteen North, and it was A-OK for me, but excellent for my partner.  I got the chicken Caesar wrap and I was not impressed.   It lacked flavor but it filled me up.  I wonder if they forgot the Caesar.  I loved my sweet potato fries, though!  I ordered my boyfriend the Prime Dip sandwich and he LOVED it so much that he forgot to share. The waitress was really great.  She asked me to check out my order and make sure everything was there.  That was a nice time-saving gesture and I appreciate the kindness.  I also really like the location.  The big windows bring in nice light on a Sunday morning.  If I could afford it, I would eat here again and try a different sandwich."}
{"text":"This place has been open for almost two years and my husband and I have finally dinned here! This place used to be an Italian spot that shut down and was quickly replaced by Thirteenth North. It's close to home but for some reason we kept passing it up. What a mistake!  I was starving the other night and wanted to eat somewhere close, so my husband suggested we finally give this a try. The parking lot is rather small and appeared to be packed, but luckily we found a spot. There's some nice patio dining out front (albeit a bit small) and the inside is on the small side too. However, this place was packed! The bar was full and there were only a few tables unoccupied. Everyone seemed to be in a good mood too.   Our hostess was quick to seat us and it seemed forever for our waitress to make an appearance, but when she did she automatically brought us waters. We were ready to order by then and once we ordered our salads appeared almost immediately. They were house salads, but I got mine with blue cheese and my husband picked Ranch. Both of us really liked the salads! They were rather large with fresh ingredients that included tomatoes, cucumbers, and had large parmesan slices. Yum! Shortly after we finished our salads, our meals came. I ordered the ribeye with mashed potatoes and my husband chose the filet. The mashed potatoes and vegetables were delicious. I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes - they had scallions and cheese. I normally don't enjoy them that much at restaurants but I brought my left overs home for dinner the next night - they were that good! Unfortunately, the ribeye was a letdown. Sure it was 14oz and covered the plate, but it was really thin and extremely fatty. I've had ribeyes at other restaurants where the steak is the same 14oz, but it is much thicker. I really prefer the thicker cut, even if it appears to be a smaller portion.  However, my husband's filet was really good. It was thick and juicy. The seasoning on both steaks were good, but needed a little salt.   We'll definitely be back to try some of the other menu offerings."}
{"text":"Cute little bar with some really good food and great waitresses.  This strikes me as the kind of bar maybe your parents would like alot: clean, good service, good food....oh wait! That's me, I'm a parent, and I say I like this place.  Nice, decent crowd. Yup, this is not the place for rowdy folks but just has the right amount of noise. Now, back to the food:  Fish tacos were good, a friend orders the same Cobb Salad each time and raves each time, the $6 burgers from 11am-5pm on weekends is really good-great meat. I like this place alot (can't you tell)."}
{"text":"Been twice and both times it's been just wonderful.   Tonight we went and once again sat on the patio. It has decent lighting, tables aren't crowded, and dog friendly. I would suggest some cushions as it's hard to sit on those mesh metal chairs too long and it's a great place to hang out.   If you check in you get a little bonus so don't forget to do that.   Tonight they had cream of broccoli soup that was so good I could've eaten a bucket.  I also had the pablono pasta. It was very flavorful and fresh. Not a heavy cream sauce. Quite nice. My friend had the green chili Mac. Very good too. My favorite part was I could tell a difference between the pepper sauces. The chef has created some nice touches here.   Last time we were here I had the pork and apples. It was such a perfect blend I felt like it was fall. The Cobb salad was just tasty and not over dressed at all.   The service is always spot on and so dang friendly. I love good service. I had heard that this place could be hot and cold however, it's only been hot in my opinion."}
{"text":"Small place with a pleasant atmosphere. The owner/manager came by to introduce himself and check on us to see if we needed anything and asked how we liked the food. Mike had one of the specialty burgers with sweet potato fries (very crispy!) and I had a Cobb salad with a glass of wine, and all were excellent!! They have a good Happy Hour also."}
{"text":"I was not impressed.  The atmosphere is alright, but nothing special. The service was alright, and our waitress seemed to be a little off.  She was unsure on what came with different entrees.  The pricing seems a little high for the area too.  I had Lobster Mac N Cheese and it was pretty good. I felt that there are other places I could have paid the same price and enjoyed myself more."}
{"text":"Super yummy burgers definitely will be back. Service was really good too.  Was here for a late lunch."}
{"text":"We went to Thirteen North today. I tried the fish tacos- Delish!!! Crispy tilapia - It was so good. Came with 2 different salsas. My husband had the $5 burger- It wasn't a premade burger patty. Looked fresh and I think it was 1/2 pound. The burger and fries was a great deal! We also shared the brownie dessert. Everything was tasty and the waitress- Kara? was on my Ice Tea refills. We will be going back!!!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly and pleasant. I really enjoyed the lemon drop messy slider also got my attention"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have always wanted to cone here and the only regret I have is that I wish we would have  went here earlier!  The place was pretty, really liked the atmosphere, and LOVED the food. We'll totally cone back here because we live down the road and because I can't get over the awesome food!"}
{"text":"I first visited here 2 years ago while in town for work upon my hotels recommendation.  I finally made it back to Phoenix and brought my husband with me this time.  Once again...it didn't disappoint.  I had the flat iron steak with garlic mashed potatoes and it was as I remembered from before.  The steak melted in my mouth and the potatoes were creamy and delicious.  It came with a side salad which too was great.  Our service was outstanding and our server took great care of us."}
{"text":"The owner Larry is very passionate about his restaurant and the food. They will even have a guest Chef make an appearance once in a while, but the food is consistently delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped in again for drinks and dinner as I heard there had been some changes. Happy to report all is still great at 13 North. Wayne is managing and bar tending. Always a great meal or just drinks and apps!! Don't let the strip mall location fool you! The food and drink here are the real deal!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's a hidden secret.   You may drive by and miss it, don't. This is a place that can make meatloaf gourmet. Yes, you read that correctly. I tell all my friends to try it, and they do, and they gleefully thank me. Trust me I was skeptical, too. How can meatloaf be so delicious?! But it is so freakin delicious.   Not only is the meatloaf delicious but they manage to do well with everything they put their knife to... Case in point: potato tacos. \"What?!\", you say? Yes. Try them.   I may be slightly biased because I live near by and this place is my go to, but seriously give it a shot. I frequent Joyride, Windsor, Flower Child, Joe's Midnight, etc. I'm telling you, don't overlook 13N. It's a hidden gem, and they will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Food was great. Server not so much. Argued with me after I requested a replacement glass of water with lemon after she replaced the lemon onto the glass as it had fallen onto her serving tray. Said her tray was sanitary and btw that's how she was trained. I will definitely go back; it's in my neighborhood and locally owned but I will not sit in Bree V. section again if I can help it."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch recently. Not too many tables busy. Somewhat small dining area, we were served quickly by very pleasant staff. Took a chance with my favorite sandwich, French dip. Great choice, served with lots of meat and melted cheese & a side of sweet potato fries. Yummmo!  Two complaints - noise level - a bit loud & distracting even with few people, not much to absorb sound of other guests. And the ladies restroom door does not shut! So strange. Nice happy hour menu, looks like a good option to try in the future."}
{"text":"We stumbled across Thirteen North having gone to the predecessor high end Italian restaurant they took over a couple of times - and were curious to see what replaced it.  We have been going back ever since, typically once a week and sometimes more frequently.  The food is always consistent, and sometimes the Chef specials are down right spectacular.  Cocktails a wonderful bargain, aside from their promotional specials on their namesake day of the month.  Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of the dining experience beyond the food (which is reason enough) is the commraradie among the patrons and the friendliness of the staff. We prefer the bar for maximum impact on both fronts.  You feel that the the owners and their staff all genuinely enjoy working there, and they make the guests feel very at home.  Bill and Bob, Phoenix"}
{"text":"Glad we decided to try this tonight. Nice unpretentious neighborhood atmosphere and good service. We had the crab dip, which is quite good, and served with a large portion of homemade potato chips. We ordered the burger with bleu cheese and the patty melt, both of which were solid. We had salads on the side rather than fries because of the big appetizer so I'm looking forward to trying the regular or sweet potato fries on future visits, as well as the different entrees. We ended by sharing a nice coffee creme brulee. Only minor complaint is that I'd like a larger draft beer selection but I can live without that."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on a Friday which was lucky for us because the fish and chips were the daily special and delicious! The cod was super fresh and the batter was not the same ol' greasy beer batter you usually get, it was light and had a great flavor. Also, they make their own tarter sauce and it had a pronounced dill flavor which I thought was great. The fries were good, but nothing special. We also got the green chili chicken mac and cheese which the waitress said was great but we found it to be....meh. The menu wasn't big but they covered a lot of options. You will definitely find something to please everyone."}
{"text":"Received a gift card from a friend to 13 N since it was one of their local favorites. My wife and I went here for our first time and were well pleased. There is a nice kind of local bar/pub/grill vibe going on and they have some pretty great daily specials. A nice selection of $13 bottles of wine was on the board as well as $5 burgers and other dishes. My wife had the Cobb salad with grilled chicken and I had the lobster mac n cheese. Both were excellent and the portions were on the larger side. My wife enjoyed it so much, she took our son back there the next day. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I like Thirteen North.  Convenient location, good atmosphere, friendly bar, outside seating.  In the words of Tracy Chapman: Give me one reason to stay here, oooh I'll turn right back around.  Reason:  Veggie wrap and sweet potato fries  Tracy:  I told you that I love you, and there ain't no more to say.   True love F O R E V E R."}
{"text":"The food is ALWAYS top notch. We are regulars and have had most menu items. One better than the next.  My biggest problem is with service. Our favorite server is Kelly. She is amazing. However... everyone else falls short.  We were there on Friday night. Kelly was off. .  Our server was not engaging.... really didn't check on us... ( someone else brought our food out and asked us). Time for the check.... dropped it off..... no words spoken. No thanks for coming in. No good bye. Oh and wasn't busy."}
{"text":"13 North has a hip vibe and a great patio for these lovely summer evenings. I hope they'll continue live music on every 13th! The meatball trio, just to die for! We'll be back soon. Great for a date-night go to."}
{"text":"Went here after finding on YELP. We were looking for a good Caesar salad! We found a great one!! We had a Cobb salad and the special blackened prawns! Delicious. Our server was Lisa and she took very good care of us. Everything is homemade! Delicious place, blood orange lemon drop was great too. Great prices!"}
{"text":"We had the mini hot mess jalapeño and crispy onion sliders, the quesadilla appetizer and lentil soup. Five stars Is all I can say. Service was amazing, excellent wine list but most of all the food was top notch. On our way to the bathroom we peaked in the kitchen and it was clean which is everything to us. The ambience of the restaurant itself was very nice. We will go back time and time again as this was our first visit, thank you very much."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always good, consistent and much of it is made from scratch. It is a big step above food normally associated with a small neighborhood restaurant.  Not many vegetarian choices on the menu but the veggie wrap is superb!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! It was our first time in and my wife and I built or own burgers. The burgers were made perfect, cooked perfect and tasted incredible. Everytime I go to squaw peak I will stop in from now on. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!  Oh, and the service was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Had one of the specials for the day: Pepperoni mushroom mac n cheese. Terrific!  I have to mention that the server was great!  There were 6 of us and even after we paid, and stayed and stayed chatting... she actually filled up our waters again!  I know that if the place was crowded, she couldn't have done that, but it's been many years since a server gave me refills after we had paid the tab.  Servers usually act as if we were invisible, even after our 20% tipping and the place isn't busy.  So I give 13 North great credit for that!  Everyone else had the turkey burgers and they all loved loved them!"}
{"text":"I usually prefer more \"plain\" kinds of restaurants and don't visit places like this too often.  This is a bar and grill of the fancier sort, with more specialized kinds of foods.  Usually, when I see \"pastas\" on a menu, I tend to think that they'll serve a few different kinds of noodles/gnocchi/stuffed pastas with a selection of sauces.  Here, you only get a few selections like three cheese mac and cheese, basil and chicken linguine, or shrimp scampi.  The menu's range is not broad, but they still offer an interesting selection.  For those a bit more cost-conscious, there is a \"happy hour\" menu where you can select things like wings, fish tacos, or chips with dip for only $5 at a certain time during the early evening.  There are also deals to be found elsewhere, and one special being offered the night we were there was an 8 oz. steak with fries and veggies for only $9.  My wife and I both opted for this with a soda, and we ended up with a total bill under $25 with drinks and tax.  Nice, and the steak had a good flavor.  We left full and satisfied for fewer $$$ than most places would have asked for.  My wife and I liked Thirteen North, and will return again.  I've got my eyes on the fish and chips for the next time. . ."}
{"text":"Wow. What a wonderful experience. Great food, great service. My meatloaf was amazing and everyone I dined with loved their meals. We will definitely be back. Very soon!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the family ate everything. The  cheese tuile was yummy for sure. We will come bavk and try a few more things."}
{"text":"Even though the food was good, and delicious; my husband had The Big Mess, with fries, and I had a Turkey Club, on 12-grain bread, hold the bacon, along with a side of cole slaw, that was yummy. The turn off, to me, was when I ordered a glass of club soda, or sparkling water.  In almost all restaurants that I patronize, even the little rinky-dink ones, they serve club soda \"on the house\".  Or if there is a charge, they tell me up front, so there is no surprises. Like the $3.00 charge, that 13 North charged.  Really?  I didn't dare ask for a refill, as the glass was so small.   $3.00 for a glass that was the same (small) size as my husband's water!!  Lesson learned.  Editing on:  I did receive a nice note from the owner.  I appreciate that.  It's the little things.  Maybe the waitress can be a little (a lot!!) more polite about my asking about the charge.  :)"}
{"text":"Visiting for Fiesta Bowl. Stopped in on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. Great food & service!  Parm cheese \"cracker\" with poblano sauce was awesome! Stop in! Worth it!"}
{"text":"the best food, staff, dessert and everything.  WONDERFUL to have the great ambiance, but, the food it amazing.   DO NOT BRING BABIES OR KIDS HERE."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate breakfast at Thirteenth North shortly after they opened on a recent saturday morning.  He had the pancakes, which were good but otherwise unremarkable, while I ordered the chicken hash. Both the chicken hash and its potato accompaniment appear to have been prepared casserole-style but tasted fantastic. The portions were smallish but good value nonetheless, as our two breakfasts plus my bloody mary came to just under $26 after tax and tip.  The bloody mary was also one of the better ones I've tasted recently.  My only real peeve with my experience here is that they advertised (and our waiter reiterated) that second drinks would only cost 13-cents, but when it came time for my second blood mary the waiter said no because my bloody mary was supposedly discounted already.  That's pretty bad.  If not for that and the fact that our waiter was a little weird and annoying, my rating would probably be 4 stars easily"}
{"text":"I don't know about this place...I've had very mixed experiences. It's just a simple neighborhood place and really nothing special. If you live nearby and want a salad or sandwich or drink, sure, drop in. But don't expect anything amazing, such as timely refills, or servers who can answer even simple questions like \"what is the sauce like?\""}
{"text":"If the food is as good as the service then I'm gonna love this place. We sat at the high tables in the bar and Terry brought it!"}
{"text":"I came here with my entire unit for a unit lunch.  The entire team was iffy about this place because the person that picked to go to this place failed miserably when picking last time.  But something told me to trust him this time.  And I'm glad I did.    The place was pretty clean and very inviting, they had a pretty cool bar too.  The service was a little slow, took them a long while to get the food out to us.  Literally my subordinate was able to do a two in their super clean loo, and the food still was not ready!  The staff was super attentive and super friendly.  I ordered some Potato Tacos and their Mac and Cheese.  Their Potato Tacos was good, honestly I could of made better, but their Mac and Cheese was amazing.  There is truly no equal to it..  it cost an arm and a leg, but I would love pay for it again!  An absolute must try!!    Overall a fun and great place to eat at, I'll definitely be back again!  Did I tell you the Mac and Cheese was amazing?  Well it is!"}
{"text":"Very good neighborhood joint. The service was amazing including the manager that greeted us as well as checked on our satisfaction. There is a decent variety of American style food. I had a burger and it was great. Large parking lot, but it was pretty full when we arrived."}
{"text":"Clean, nice atmosphere, VERY friendly/prompt service, good values on menu. However, I found the food a bit uninspiring. When I go to an independently owned restaurant I want food that isn't chain-esque. I will definitely be back but it's not a place I will visit regularly."}
{"text":"Much love for thirteen north grille. I support most local, owner operated restaurants when the atmosphere and food quality work synergistically. This place may be hidden among the hustle of \"uptown\" but you won't be disappointed is you give it a try. Best neighborhood hangout, meets quality care for menu items, meets non pretentious environment. 5 stars forever."}
{"text":"Groupon is Poopon. Seems places nowadays aren't really trying anymore. Seems all I can do is leave negative because I can cook better at home. Got the Groupon and was dying to go here for three weeks. It's close and loved the reviews and online menu.  Below Mediocre ambiance for the prices. Paper napkins always bad with $18 entrees. Battery operated candles at the tables, which I turned on to set the mood. Whoopee!  Tim the waiter was good. Two tvs with sports on them at the bar, which is in the dining room...kinda weird.  Ordered the fish fry cod and pork tenderloin for the adults. Split a burger and Mac and cheese for the two girls. Oh, and fried calamari and wine and beer. Soda in styrofoam cups is good at Juliobertos...not here.  Calamari sauce was great. But, Better calamari in the frozen food section at frys. Chewy and tiny. I was betting the girls $5 each to take a bite. They declined. ($10) added to the bill.  Waiting on that fish fry ($14) and everything took about 30 minutes...and two beers ($11). Finally...everything shows up and I cut into one of the fried cod \"balls\"....cold and raw on the inside...I had so been craving fried fish and my dreams were ruined.  Showed Tim the waiter and he apologized and offered to bring a different dish. Well...you all know what happens to your food when you send it back.  I opted for another beer instead of dinner. $5.50 drafts.  Mac and cheese = great. But for $9?  Not so much.  Pork good, mashed potatoes cold. Who is cooking here?  Mashed potatos stay HOT for 20 minutes when I make them!  Green beans were soggy thin worms. ($19 special?) Burger:  had to cut off the bottom charcoal piece and the girls couldn't eat it. Who's cooking here?  Showed Tim again and he apologized and took the burger and fish off the bill.  No other comps for the waste of time and money. Maybe it's normal here? So, we got out with two out of the four of us actually eating for around $75, with the Groupon. Still gave Tim a 18% tip for him trying.  My advice:  ASK GROUPON FOR A REFUND BEFORE GOING.   Tim said the cook apologized and was training a new cook, so things were not as usual. Check your product BEFORE it goes out to the customer. Cook is not a Chef.  Cooks make dollar menu items. Chefs make pork tenderloin in a bourbon sauce as advertised. Please, it's Friday, get your stuff together. If you absolutely kill a burger, make another and serve it right.  Please don't serve your horrible mistake to my kids.  I'll see what the one bite of raw cod does to me in a few hours. Thanks for the beer ($17.50)."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great prices and friendly staff...   They have specials on the \"13th\" of the month. I got a half-rack of ribs, salad and 2 sides for $13....the taste was amazing.   I also had a side order of steamed clams, I couldn't find these anywhere else in Arizona...they were great.   Easy access off the 51 freeway and Northern, I drove all of the way up from South-East Chandler to eat here and I would definitely do it again."}
{"text":"We were here on a late Saturday afternoon.  We ended up sitting right near where the bored servers hang out,  We cared.  They didn't.  It was really irritating because it was already hard to hear in the restaurant.  I think the high ceiling must make voices carry...  Our appetizer was the house made potato chips with crab dip.  It was weird.  They would have been ok seperately but they just do not go together at all.   The $5 burger was fine.  I live pretty close, so I wanted to like it.  But it was just a weird experience.    Maybe it was just an early Saturday night thing - but it looked like a elderly HH hot spot at the bar."}
{"text":"Service 5 stars Food 3.5-4; 13 North is located right of Northern is a Shopping plaza, by the way looks can be deceiving.   My server Kelly was AMAZING - never did I have an empty cup..  We came for brunch; I had the traditional egg breakfast which was tasty.  The Parmesan Tule you must try it was delicious.   The owner did come over and was very nice and made sure we were ok, which gives it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Umm.. here we go. It was a nice restaurant to sit down with the family and enjoy a good meal. The food was great, everything went well.. but our waiter didn't seem too happy about taking our orders or even working. He looked so annoyed and was rushing our orders. When we asked for condiment,  he looked all stressed out. By the way, HE WAS THE ONLY ONE ON THE FLOOR."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place for almost two years on my way to work and each time, planned to stop in. Finally made it on a day I was in the mood for soup. The place was empty when I arrived (they had just opened) and was spotless and welcoming.   The waitress/hostess was very friendly, provided the day's specials and offered a few of her favorites. I reluctantly ordered the jambalaya. Generally, as a woman with southern roots, I'd only do that at a place known for such dishes but I was very, very pleasantly surprised at how good 13 North's dish was! Perfect amount of heat, not too salty, good amount of sausage, shrimp and chicken, and a satisfying (but not so big to put you to sleep) lunch portion.  Definitely plan to come back and try their Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"There is a variety of selections to choose from. The restaurant has entree salads, sandwiches, a daily rotating soup and several other meals to pick from. There is a full bar available.  Sometimes there are creative specials available.  The thirteenth of each month can be a fun day to visit Thirteen North. There are usually some fun celebratory specials to pick from. I have seen them priced at $13.  Hopefully you can find something you will like here."}
{"text":"This is such a delightful neighborhood restaurant with staff that make you feel so welcomed! But what really sets this place apart, is the Philly cheesesteak. It is truly the best thing on the menu. Now I know what all you northern transplants are thinking, oh my God someone who doesn't understand cheesesteaks has the audacity to think a Phoenix restaurant somehow got it right. In my defense, both of my parents are from New Jersey so I know a least a little bit about good cheesesteaks and this one is really good. (Ok it's NOT Pats but it also doesn't require a plane ride to Philly!) It's now the only thing I order when I go in and there are a lot of good choices on this menu. The wine selection is decent as well as the beer selection, which they carry not a ton of options on draft but generally have one or two solid local draft options. They offer brunch on the weekend and outdoor seating so during the perfect Phoenix weather in the fall and spring you can enjoy sitting outside. If you're in the area give this one a try it's a winner!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed myself when I have come here and in fact have taken friends here, Their food was delicious and their martinis were very good, However I was surprised by the customer service on this visit, When we sat down we asked about the 12.00 to 5.00 special in regards to $5.00 burgers. We were about 15 minutes late, The waitress said it was no problem and we proceeded with the order.      The waitress then came back after about 5 minutes and proceeded to tell us we needed to order a drink with our meal. Which was fine, so we got some beverages. The waitress came back again to tell us that we could not get the deal and we would have to pay full price. After I complained the manager gave us a couple dollars off but I feel that it was not enough and we should have received the deal.      I did not complain further at the table and we ate our meal which was above average; however I feel that our business was not really valued and will not be dining there again.  I understand that mistakes happen and the waitress was new but if we  ordered alcoholic beverages that we were not going to order and then we have to pay extra for things. The service was meh . . .  That's all there is to it,"}
{"text":"Thirteen North is a restaurant that I frequent often. The food is always fresh and then make your own sauces and dressings from scratch .. I own a business a couple doors down called Lifestyle Pilates at 1321 East northern... I recommend the restaurant to all my clients and they have all been very happy and I would highly recommend them for you if you haven't already tried them"}
{"text":"After hiking North Mountain, I wanted to get a light lunch. Thirteen North really delivered. My step mom and I shared their chicken caesar salad with grilled chicken (11$ ish). This salad was giant.... easily enough for the two of us... and was very tasty. The chicken was perfectly cooked, the salad was fairly standard, the croutons were crispy and well seasoned. I would like to come back to try their burgers or mac and cheese or brunch!"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews. (I know I am a terrible person!!!) I got the Thirteen North menu in my mailbox and was dying to try the chicken ceasar wrap. I had one years ago that was outstanding and I've been looking for one just as good. Well after weeks of driving by but opting for one of my regular eat-out spots I went into Thirteen North with my mom and we decided to get a few different things and split all of it. We ordered the shrimp scampi and of course the wrap. I LOVED EVERYTHING. The pasta was light and full of flavor. Just the right amount of everything. My mom also had a long island that she raves about.   The next day we decided to go again and try some different things. We brought along a few more people. The Prime Dip sandwich was out of this world. The soup of the day was great and our service was top notch.  I consider myself to be an eat out guru. I love this area and I've been to all the great spots. Thirteen North is my new favorite place. I am writing this review to make it completely clear how great they are. I want them to succeed and stay open forever (selfishly so I can keep eating there).   I've been telling everyone I know about Thirteen North and will continue to do so. GO THERE! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Was looking for a non-chain restaurant & this is the jewel i found. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal plus they gave wonderful suggestions for wine.  All was wonderful plus great personal service."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late lunch recently and were super impressed! Our family had met up in Phoenix and we are a bit of a crazy bunch but 13 North was super amazing about accommodating us and getting us all setup.   Our server walked us through some favorites and got us started with a cheese crisp right away. That crisp was amazing, a giant cheese cracker in a roll and the dipping sauce was out of this world. We got the mac and cheese too to share because it used some of this same sauce!  I think we pretty much got burgers all around and they were great! Everything came out promptly and everyone was on top of everything!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is very delicious they also have a special menu and the enchiladas are the best here they only serve them on the weekends I believe"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Close to home with quality food.  I usually get the salmon and out never disappoints.  Comes with delicious mashed potatoes and fresh grilled veggies. Yes please! Cute outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Tried this little neighborhood place with a Yelp review and certificate.  The young lady who seated us was the best part of the visit.  Met a former coworker there to have a light meal and conversation early in the evening so we could catch up while the place was quiet.  Enter pushy waitness without basic knowledge of menu items. \"Nearly traditional\" or something like that prompted me to ask what made the deviled eggs special.  She could not answer. After a long pause she said,\"I think maybe bacon bits\"  A new server could say,  \"I am not sure, let me ask.\"  She then came back no less than four times in a fifteen minute span to take our order.  The first two visits were before we opened the menu.   As I mentioned, the goal was a light meal. The food was in no way remarkable.  I have nothing to say except the burger didn't sit well (3/4 of it was too much) and the sandwich appeared greasy.    The highlight of the experience was the young woman who seated us, she also kept the drink glasses full.   I am glad the neighbors had a better experience.  There are two better places in the strip mall I will visit again before I return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Husband and I tried it for the first time last night and loved it! Our server, Lisa, was welcoming, funny and helpful in recommending cocktails and specials. I had the rib eye special served with a squash I'd never had before and it was delicious. Served with a wine sauce, sautéed mushrooms, onions and jalapeños. Husband had the pike, which was summery and bright, also very delicious. Shared the mac and cheese, built on it with sautéed and crispy onions and pepper bacon--it was killer! They use 3 cheeses so it's rich and creamy. Had a lemon drop cocktail which was super yum, and husband had a Kickin Mule, their version of Moscow Mule, also great. Other servers stopped by our table to check on us which made us feel like we were truly in a neighborhood restaurant. Can't believe it's taken us this long to eat there--definitely will be repeat customers!"}
{"text":"$5 burgers on the weekends (11am-5pm I believe). Great burgers. Also have the no cost option of chicken boob or turkey burger (which was surprisingly juicy), different flavored mayos, and fry options. I have only been there for the burgers so far, so that is all I can comment on. Service has always been good. I hope more people start taking advantage of the burger special to keep it going!"}
{"text":"We bought the Groupon and so glad that we did.  They had mixed reviews but we thought we would give it a try.  Service was wonderful!  Everything we had was yummy.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I live right up the street and were looking for a restaurant to support in the neighborhood. We pass by Thirteen North everyday, and finally decided to give it a try. It was Sunday evening and North was fairly empty. Yet, it took the server 10min to ask us for our drinks. A server should welcome you and take your drink orders in the first 30-45 seconds upon sitting. That was the customer service.   I built my own burger, and asked for it be done medium. I also asked for garlic fries. The burger was extremely greasy. As soon as I pressed down on the soggy bun, the grease immediately ran down my wrist. I don't mind a juicy burger but a grease dripping burger is not okay. I would say the same thing for the garlic fries.   My hands were so greasy, I couldn't get it off after washing it twice in the restroom. I also felt sick afterwards - the same feeling you get when you eat a large popcorn bag drenched in butter.  Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Wow!  Found a real neighborhood gem.  The hot mess burger was delicious.  We also shared a Cobb salad which was the best one I have ever had.  We will definitely be back and often.  Great food, great service."}
