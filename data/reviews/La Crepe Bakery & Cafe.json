{"text":"I told my boyfriend I wanted breakfast and he surprised me and brought me to this wonderful little place. I was SO pleased with everything about La Crepe I can not wait to come back. The staff was super friendly, and the food was positively delicious! I had the breakfast crepe and my boyfriend had the pastry creme crepe and we absolutely loved them. Mine came with a small tasty side salad as well. The coffee was good and the atmosphere was relaxing and calm. I think it's safe to say I've found a new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"We love this place and go at least once a week. The roasted chicken, breakfast, mushroom, and strawberry and Brie are our favorites! Photo is of the Strawberry and Brie crepe."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  Such a lovely little getaway!  The food was great!  So nice to find a place that serves crepes!  The atmosphere is charming.  Just lovely.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and can't wait to go back! The crepes are incredible and the staff are all very friendly. Each crepe is stuffed well; they are not skimpy on their ingredients at all! You order your food and pay before you pick a place to sit so tipping is optional. You can also watch then make your crepes. The decor is cute."}
{"text":"I hate to write a review like this with so many other glowing reviews, but we just did not have a good (dining) experience.  The folks who work behind the counter were very pleasant and the food items were clearly made from scratch...unfortunately that did not make up for dishes that no one at our table really cared for.

I ordered the ham and brie savory crepe which was served with a small side salad.  The crepe was stuffed with large pieces of ham and melted brie cheese, but the entire thing was fairly dry and monotonous and was served with a small dish of ranch dressing (for dipping the crepe I suppose?).  I was an odd combination, and others at the table had the same small dish of dressing on the side.

I will say the the side salad was good, though!  It contained a nice mix of greens, tomatoes, Parmesan flakes and a light dressing.

Wish i could be more positive about the food experience, but others at my table confirmed the same feelings about their dishes as well, so I know I was not alone."}
{"text":"The place is awesome, the food is something amazing. I am crepes fan and I was waiting for place like that for long time 
PS breakfast crepe and strawberry banana the BEST"}
{"text":"Wow! We had the Squid ink salmon, Breakfast crepe, and House Super. The flavors are amazing. You must eat here! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place with a friend yesterday, and it was great. Their chicken crepe was very good and came with a very nice salad. The desserts looked amazing and I plan to come by and try some one day."}
{"text":"Visiting son at school, followed Yelp rec for breakfast and very happy- delicious breakfast crepes and sweet ones, cappuccino perfect- quiet and small and could be slow if busy. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place.  Welcome to Berea!  Stopped on a Sun. before they closed.  They were packed, so we went back the next morning to avoid the crowd.  Owners were very personable and engaging.  We had the potato pancakes that, I think, they were adding to the menu.  Coffee was magnifique.  Great to have both classy and culture with a great price right here in town.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Randomly walked in here with my wife and we're pleasantly surprised. Owned by actual Europeans. I don't trust a crepe place unless there's Europeans working there lol. In Europe people grow up eating all kinds of crepes more so than in America so they're familiar with a proper crepe. They do make a proper crepe here in this wonderful establishment. Environment is very chill and people are super polite. In the heart of downtown Berea, the location is prime! Love it and recommend it to everyone and anyone."}
{"text":"Finally, an amazing creperie in town!  Beautiful cute French themed cafe in downtown Berea.  I have had two of their sweet crepes (brie and strawberry and brie and pear).  Both were DELICIOUS and made fresh.  The crepes are also a decent size so I actually felt like I had breakfast.  There's also coffee, savory crepes, and a few other tasty menu items.  My fellow diners had a savory crepe and one of the crepes with dates - both were thoroughly enjoyed.  I wouldn't think this was a great place for children, but we made it work and there are high chairs.  Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Still LOVE this place.  I probably stop in once a week for a cappuccino.  Every crepe is great though."}
{"text":"Delicious, homey, and fast. Enjoyed a lovely morning here amidst a blustery day. Great coffee and crepes!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dropped in here and we were pleased with the coffee and the roasted chicken crepe.  People were very nice and the place is well maintained. 

Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim while running errands. Quaint little place and the young lady working was nice and professional. I ordered the Brie & Pear crepe and it was AMAZING!! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The savory ham and Brie crepe came with a dill cream dip, and a nice bright tasting salad that was a perfect pairing. And the bite I had of my wife's sweet pear and Brie was definitely delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow what a place. Nice atmosphere. Great service. The house super creme crepe was wonderful. Nice little cafe that you should try out.  I know I will be back"}
{"text":"I ordered the soup of the day, chicken noodle, and a Nutella crepe with strawberries. The soup had a bit to much pepper for my taste and the crepe was okay, all other crepes I have had are much softer. This one was a bit crisp, and the fruit was mostly in the center so when I ate it the further I got the less fruit was present."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place in Berea. Everyone is friendly. Great French toast and delicious desert. Definitely be back."}
{"text":"We happened upon this cafe by chance, with me searching for the best macaroons near me and stumbling upon La Crepe. First, the atmosphere in this little cafe is amazing. You step down in and it's got this beautiful dessert case on display, you can see the set up for the crepes and it's just so pretty. Second, we didn't just stop at macaroons. We also indulged, buying a peanut butter cheesecake for him and a l'opera cake for myself. The macaroons; amazing. I just wish there were a few more flavors so I could indulge more! The desserts were just okay, overall a little dry and nothing impressive. We are stoked to come back and try out the crepes, as I love making them at home and they look delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, incredibly reasonable price for an outstanding breakfast! I got the breakfast crepe and couldn't have been happier with going out of the way to stop by this bakery. If only I knew how to cook like this at home!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my family. Our little one had some French toast and it was a hit. My wife had a vegetable crepe and was really pleased. I had the breakfast crêpe. Anything with a fried egg on top is great!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast around 11:15 Sunday. Small place busy, but seating still available. Waited in line behind two other customers about 10 min. We asked for two breakfast crepes and two coffees. We were told it would be about 40 minutes. The person ahead of us ordered, no wait. Absolutely ridiculous. Left without eating."}
{"text":"Nice crêpe place right in downtown Berea. Nice place to stop for lunch if you're downtown. They have both savory crepes and also sweet desert crepes, plus soup."}
{"text":"Excellent quaint little shop in the middle of Berea with good coffee and delicious options. From savory crepes with ham and spinach to sweet Nutella and strawberry choices, there is something for every palette. The dessert options are homemade and plentiful from ice cream to bakery. 

I'll definitely be going back, whether for breakfast or dessert or whatever. Another great place in Berea, who has suddenly gained several quality eating establishments."}
{"text":"This is a cute little cafe. They serve a coffee, tea, smoothies, and soft drinks as well as food. Unfortunately for me, they don't have a lactose free milk substitute to make the specialty coffee drinks, so I had to settle for Snapple. 

I had a caramel pear and Brie Crepe. It was wonderful. 

The service we got was excellent. The owner was very caring."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was great the servers were extremely nice and helpful. I recommend this place to anyone in Berea or passing through Berea"}
{"text":"Extraordinary! Service and food was amazing. The four of us had breakfast crepe, Nutella crepe, chicken crepe, and a panini. If I lived around here we would be a frequent visitor."}
{"text":"Great food, Strawberries and Brie was great, as was the breakfast Crepe. Good portions that are light and fluffy withOut feeling too full. Great coffee and staff, very relaxing environment. Will be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I ordered the Bailey's salted caramel crepe and it was tasty, but not the best I've ever had. I think it had more to do with the flavor combination than anything else. It was topped with dollops of whipped cream and sliced cantaloupe. The place itself is cute and is in a cute part of town."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast crepe; crisp, dry salad greens (hate when salad is water-logged!); pretty presentation of food; pleasant, friendly staff; good coffee! The desserts looked incredible, though I was too full to sample this time. My only suggestion is that you take a jacket - it was quite chilly!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place to have right here in downtown Berea! Tried it today for the 1st time and it was delicious. We had the savory roasted chicken crepe, which was amazing even my 6 year old loved it! We also had the savory ham and Brie crepe also very good! My kids had the maple syrup French toast they loved it so much I had to get them a second order. The crepes we a great size and they came with a side salad that was also delicious and nice touch. My kids are already taking about going back soon!"}
{"text":"Every crepe I've tried is fantastic and the recipes taste like they're straight from Europe. They're so unique and you'll never try anything quite like them anywhere else in Cleveland. The food is as authentic as the wonderful ladies who own it!

My favorites are the squid ink smoked salmon and house super cream with strawberries and bananas. The smoked salmon has cream cheese, caviar and the crepe itself has squid ink mixed into the batter and makes every bite burst with flavour. The house super cream is a passion fruit cream-filled crepe that has an unbelievably fruity flavour unlike anything I've ever had. You can also ask for samples of some of the crepe fillings before ordering.

It's a nice, trendy restaurant when you want quality food quickly in a cozy atmosphere."}
