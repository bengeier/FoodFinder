{"text":"Taking a bite of their sweet potatoes is like taking a bite out of heaven. Their chicken is fried to perfection and their Cobbler was made to a standard that only Chuck Norris could possibly compete with."}
{"text":"Everything was sooo sooo good!!! We had ox tails, fried chicken, greens, black eyed peas, cornbread & the kool-aid was on point and we can't forget the peach cobbler. .. May God continue to bless this place!! :)"}
{"text":"Ew.. Let's start with that. I went into mrs whites skeptical of the help reviews. I figured I would either love it or hate it. I walked in and the staff could've cared less that I was there. I was yelled at from the counter to see if I wanted anything to drink. The sweet tea is very good, I will give them that. The staffs clothing was dirty and unkept. It looked like they hadn't brushes their hair in days. We were pretty neglected and got no useful tips from ordering off of their very limited menu. The food was okay, the cornbread and canned yams being the best. It was good to go see what everyone was taking about but I will not be back again."}
{"text":"Okay, so I am rather new to town and have been to very famous and not so famous soul food restaurants around the world, and this one is to me, only decent.  I decided to try this restaurant out today after visiting an historical church for Sunday service, that is right across the street.  

As I walked over to the restaurant, I got giddy inside thinking that I would be welcomed by absolutely amazing down home soul food that I have experienced in Harlem, Houston, St. Louis, New Jersey, and even Philly, but I was not.  I knew that the ambiance was not going to be upscale, which is fine with me, but the food is not as exciting as the previous reviewers make it seem.  Maybe my taste buds are a little too snobby, but like I said I have had amazing soul food in other places, not just the South. 

Moving on, I had the fried chicken, mac n cheese, black eyed peas, cabbage, and corn bread.  I must say that the black eyed peas and corn bread were pretty good, but the cabbage lacked lots of flavor, and so did the fried chicken.  Also the fried chicken was very salty, but lacked flavor, which to me is a little oxymoronic. 

The waitress/waiter were very nice.  I will not go back because I do not feel like the meal was worth the $13.00 plus tax.

I will go over and try Lo-Los Chicken and Waffles soon and hopefully there, I will find delicious soul food that I left behind on the East Coast in New Jersey, NY, and Philly!"}
{"text":"Such wonderful humans and delicious food. We ordered the fried okra, macaroni and cheese, black eyed peas, and green beans as our sides and had the golden fried southern chicken (regular and smothered) for our main. All of it was cooked to perfection and fed our souls. Their fried chicken beats Lolo's any day and rivals Roscoe's in LA."}
{"text":"This place is heaven on earth. I tried the fired chicken and it was absolutely amazing. They give you good portions and always made to order. If you like Lo Lo's then you'll love this place too!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely AMAZING! If your looking for authentic soul food, look no more. I literally travel around the country to seek places like these. Mrs. Whites Golden Rule Cafe will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak with yams, green beans, cornbread,  and sweet tea. The best!! Service isn't the greatest,  but that's not why you come here. You come to get your grub on ;)"}
{"text":"Best soulfood in Phoenix..The Service was great .The greens ,sweet potatoes &  fried chicken was amazing .besides the dry cornbread everything was on point . ill definitely come again .."}
{"text":"Food was OK. The staff was overwhelmed by a half dozen customers. They were watching the Jerry Springer show in stead helping the PAYING customers. Would not return to this restaurant.
The legacy of Mrs. White has been wrecked."}
{"text":"Drove to this place from Glendale this past Friday. Got there about 5:30pm and not that many people there.

We ordered. Had to remind the waitress about the lemonade since it took awhile and she was texting at the counter. Thought it would be freshly squeezed because of the wait time---nope.

Took hours for the food. Waitress and cook yelling at each other in the kitchen. Someone forgot one of our two orders. Insincere apologies followed.

Food was OK. Agreed with the previous reviewer...Fry's fried chicken is way better!

If you want attitude while they forget your food, this place is it!"}
{"text":"Waited a long time to order but waited forever to get our food. The food was just so-so and not worth the wait.  The one good thing was definitely the kool-aid."}
{"text":"This review is from someone raised in Phoenix, so my taste for heavy fried food isn't so accurate compared to my southern counterparts.  I give this a solid rating, if not just for the atmosphere.  Not your typical Phoenix establishment...very friendly, very homey.  I did feel like I took in more salt than I usually do in a month, but the greens were fabulous!  The chicken wasn't my ultimate favorite ever, but still better than anything you can find in the valley."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I'm from Georgia and I know good soul food with a mother from there and grandmother from Mississippi. The fried chicken was crunchy and well seasoned. The mac & cheese was great also. My girlfriend had the smothered pork chops with cabbage and rice and gravy. The pork chops were very good. This is overall a good place to go eat to have the southern home feel."}
{"text":"Everything here tasted like fried chicken, which is a good thing if you like fried chicken.   The catfish I had also tasted vaguely of chicken...also Mrs White used the same batter for both...very light and crisp...though I must admit to preferring the touch of cornmeal like the way that they do it at Lolo's.    Mrs. White's also got some mean chicken fried steak here.

All the meal platter work out to be $11 (after taxes) and you get choices of 2 sides.  

Good solid rendition of soul food:  3 stars place with extra points for longevity."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and well.....it was the most disgusting soul food I've ever eaten in my life!!! I ordered fried chicken, sweet potatoes, & red beans. The chicken had no seasoning or flavor. I bet my 10 yr old brother could cook better chicken. The red beans same thing, no seasoning & nasty at that!! Sweet potatoes, where's the brown sugar butter cinnamon/nutmeg?? The soul was definately missing in this so called soul food. If u like wasting $$ on crappy food, then this is your place! Frys deli chicken tasted better than this place lol"}
{"text":"Well me and my friend from work tried this place out, and others we talked to gave rave reviews.  Both of us though walked away and were not impressed with the food at all.  The only thing that we both liked were the sweet potatoes.  I had the Chicken Fried Steak and it was very salty then after a few bites was very very soggy and gelatinous.  I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The best fried chicken I have ever had
pork cutlet is not to be missed either
the collard greens flavor is unbelievable and purely vegetarian broth if you can belive that - absolutely no sourness

I regular have to make pilgrimages for my pregnant wife here.

Negative - cash only"}
{"text":"OK, the fried chicken her is legit. Juicy, tender on the inside. Skin was nice and crisp as you bite into it. The sides were nothing spectacular however I did enjoy their coleslaw. To bad they don't sell just the chicken by the piece because I think people would go their just to buy a bucket of chicken and nothing else. They sell their food in plates. Pick a protein, choose two sides, and you get a piece corn bread. They cost about $13. I feel like we definitely got a lot of food. The place it self looks very old. Not well kept. Appears dirty. The servers were nice but the guy in charge seemed like he didn't care much about the customers. He was watching TV most of the time. Food also took a very long time to come out. Fyi they sell kool aid if you like to drink that with your meal."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!

We can't go back there. Went there for the first time tonight and was expecting great food. We walked in, no one came up to greet us. Instead they stayed back behind the counter and told us to sit anywhere without any kind of courtesy or etiquette. Our waitress definitely did not want to be there and had an attitude. We picked a table and sat down. They were slow to give us our menus. We got our food quick enough and it was tasty but definitely not better than Lolo's. The waitress never came back to ask if we need anything else or to fill our water or lemonade glasses. We had to shout across the dining room to get her attention for more lemonade. The absolute worst was when we went up to pay, they never handed us a bill and overcharged us. The old man at the register didn't even know what we ordered and when we told him, just spat out a number \"$33.16!\" without doing any kind of math. He was very rude to my boyfriend who tried to pay with a credit card. Instead of just asking my boyfriend if he had cash, he barked, \"Didn't you see the sign?! We take cash!\" We didn't make a scene but it really pissed us off. Their signage is confusing. There was a broken machine sign on the wall but the menu said \"we are now accept credit and debit cards.\" 

Also, the place is filthy. Dirty floors, walls, and windows. The bathroom smells like hot ass. For some reason, the bathrooms don't have AC but the rest of the restaurant does. Absolute worst! We've had great food and service at Lolo's! They definitely know how to make you feel welcomed. I love the servers at Lolo's; they are attentive, friendly, and helpful. I can't believe the two families are related. WE WILL NEVER GO BACK!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate there today. The chicken was okay. What I did like about the chicken....it was not greasy. What I didn't like, no flavor. We weren't told until after we ordered that they were out of macaroni and cheese and coleslaw . They brought us cornbread with no honey. The service was less than average. They took our order for drinks but did not bring them in a timely fashion. We then placed our order. While waiting we asked for refills . We had no napkins or forks at our table. We had asked the person who refilled our drinks but he never came for them. As we ate the cornbread we had to wipe our hands on our pants due to ,no napkins. Our food finally came but as the people who brought our food were leaving we asked for napkins and forks. My daughter in law ordered pork chops but the plate came with no knife. The server did come immediately to bring forks and napkins but we said we needed a knife. No knife came. We're eating and enjoying our food and a server came to the area for another table as she was leaving we asked for a knife. No knife was coming because this server started waiting on another table. my husband then gave his knife he had been eating his chicken fried steak with so she could eat her pork chop. Then he finally went to the front to get a knife. Just because you are a Phoenix staple from back in the 60's does not mean service should lack. It seems unorganized. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because my daughter in law and husband said the pork chop was tasty, the green beans and potatoes were good, so was the catfish. I know inside is dated but it was like you were stepping back in time. My suggestion would be for the staff to take a trip to Amy Ruth's in Harlem. Eat there for breakfast , lunch and dinner and take note of the food, the cleanliness, customer service, and organization of the staff."}
{"text":"Um, yeah. Very yeah. Mrs. White's may be a dive but what a dive it is! The fried chicken and smothered pork chops are so ridiculously good that it's hard to imagine visiting Phoenix again and not heading back there the moment I land at the airport. I would give it 5 stars but the atmosphere is...um...an acquired taste."}
{"text":"Don't understand the hype about this place. Went in today only to be disappointed.  Nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"The food is definitely a 4. One of the best fried chicken and greens in all of Phoenix. The staff is definitely friendly. It's a little too pricey for almost $20 per person though."}
{"text":"Great, great food. Lousy service. You are treated as an aftertought. Mr.White is constantly correcting the kitchen staff. If you don't mind crap service+great food....this is the place."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hole in the wall.  Don't expect fancy furnishings.  The air conditioner was not functioning or they just didn't want to turn it on because there wasn't that many people at the time.  They did bring an electric fan out.

I had the oxtail special.  The waitress said it was cook in its own sauce.  I suspect that it was slow cook or braised with very little liquid.  It was tender but with just a right tad of chewiness left in it.  So, the texture was perfect.  You had to work it just a little bit in your mouth and that's when the flavor releases into your senses.  The ligaments near the bones were just out of this world.  Yes, you have to gnaw at the bones to get to it.  The portion is generous.  I have two sides, green beans and yams.  The yam was good but the beans tasted like canned beans.  The corn bread was gritty and nice.  I also had a lemonade which was cool and sweet.  

My friends had fried chicken, catfish, smother pork chops.  We all finished our plates cleaned."}
{"text":"Read about Mrs. White's online and figured I should give it a try. I wish I had found it sooner. I had the chicken fried steak with rice and Mac and cheese. The portions are generous and the food is tasty. Sadly I didn't save room for dessert, but the peach cobbler looked very tempting.  I will try to remember this when I go back next time."}
{"text":"I have to admit that the 1st time I was taken to Mrs. White's, I was a bit hesitant about the place. However, once we were in, seated and placed our order, I was thoroughly comfortable and enjoying the vibe. It was lunch time, it was crowded and it reminded me of a family reunion. Everyone was enjoying their meals and each other. The staff was busy as bees and enjoying themselves as well. 

I had the fried chicken, green beans and corn bread---all perfectly cooked and seasoned---just like Granny used to make. Huge serving sizes, had to take most of it back to my hotel because I also wanted to try their peach cobbler.....yummy for the tummy! 

It has been about 10 years since my 1st introduction to Mrs. White's and 
I have visited many times throughout the years and have had most everything on the menu, never been disappointed. 

Best soul food in AZ      
I love, love, love Mrs. White's"}
{"text":"First off, I'm going to start by saying that the service was an abomination. We went on a Saturday afternoon, Maybe 10 people in the whole place. From start to finish it took almost 3 hours. Three of us ordered drinks, waited 15 minutes. Not too bad I guess, But then the food service happened. 

3 Orders. Every single one was messed up. From wrong sides to whole wrong orders. 
One order was completely wrong to the point my head almost exploded and worst of all, nobody cared. We received two side for one order before the protein, Then my order came, which had a wrong side 20+ minutes after the other's sides. Then a 3rd plate came that was wrong entirely. Which they took back and fixed after another 20+ minute wait. So once they've fixed my sides and another person's whole meal the waiter goes \" Okay, we're all good here?\" .......At this point we are still missing the Main protein from the very first dish, who at this point has eaten her sides because it's been just under an hour later. 

The cook came out and gave the most half-assed apology I've ever heard and moved along with her day, She couldn't have cared less. I was told this place was great but our experience was terrible. The chicken was decent at best and the side were underwhelming. I wanted to like this place so much, But Alas I cannot."}
{"text":"I can only give this 1 star and that's because the gentleman who checked us in and out was so kind. The food was awful, and our waitress was so nasty. I grew up on soul food and this doesn't come close to what i was raised on. I was so looking forward to a good home cooked meal, yuk, no flavor, such a disappointment, oh and if that's cornbread, then i don't know what to say.Oh and i forgot, they were out of dessert, how does that happen, not one dessert, that's one of the reasons we went. never again."}
{"text":"Fried chicken was great, cabbage was great, potato salad was great, cornbread was good.  This is a good spot to check out, doesn't look like much on the outside, but the food is great.  I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I cannot speak to the experience others have had but for me - lawd Jesus this food is GOOD! I've had the fried catfish, black eyed peas, cabbage and corn bread. Planning soon to return and try the fried chicken and smothered pork chops."}
{"text":"Listed on Phoenix top 50 things to do, well take it off.  Sat at the counter, watching an interesting news story. Young guy comes and changes channel to sports then walks away (really). Alot of young people working, guy sweeping the floors then picks up plate from window to serve.  Catfish was ok, greens all stems, mac n cheese no flavor, black eye peas mushy like they were old/reheated. Lemonade good, not too sweet. Left disappointed, would not go back or recommend."}
{"text":"If you want a great home cooked meal...then eat here. The place is real small but the food is great. For 10 and some odd cents you get a whole lot of food for little money.

For drinks they have  Iced tea, lemon-aid, coffee, kool-aid, water. The outside and inside do not look like much, but it's the food that is great. Try it, you'll go back!"}
{"text":"Moved to PHX a year ago and this is one the best meals we've had, definitely the best FRIED CHICKEN!  We had their fried chicken meal.  I also had the green beans and macaroni and cheese.  Both were wonderful.  My husband had the sweet potatoes and cole slaw.  We were there for lunch and am ready to go back for dinner!  The sweet tea was perfect, not too sickly sweet and the peach cobbler was perfectly homemade.

Can't wait to return to Mrs. White's!"}
{"text":"If this review was only for the food i would give it a higher score. Over priced but very good. Waiter seemed a little overworked but he did a fine job. However, when we went to pay we were stuck standing there for about 10 minutes until an older gentleman finally came out and barely said a word to me. He pulled the receipt and tossed it at me without saying a word. I signed it only to make sure the waiter got his tip and the man tossed my copy at me the same way. The man was incredibly rude and i will never ever return. Ill stick with lolo's."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed today in the service,food overall & the long time to get our food. (1.5 hours). There were only two other tables & they were served before us. The five dinners were brought out one by one. To think I came here on my birthday to celebrate?! Should of gone to Lolo's as the rest of the gang wanted to. At least Lolo's can say thank you & sorry.
And....no cooler or A/C in the back part of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Well, where to begin. The place isn't anything fancy. That's probably a major understatement. If you are looking for ambience this isn't it. However, it was full of people from as diverse of cultures as possible for somewhere this small. Also, nobody is any hurry here which feels like a southeastern thing. 

So why five stars then?  Well, I found this place on Yelp and was aware of all of the above. People still raved about the food!  I ordered the fried chicken meal with mixed greens and red beans and rice. Wow!  I had no idea fried chicken could taste like this. Super crispy and flavorful breading and very moist chicken. The highlight of the meal may have been the mixed greens. They were fantastic. Got a peach cobbler for the wife on the way out. Did it all for $20 including tip. Won't miss this place when back in Phoenix!  

Matty approved!"}
{"text":"Not pretentious, not fancy ....... But the food is awesome!!
Found them by accident the first time BEFORE I knew they had been featured on The best thing I ever ate.  My wife and I felt welcomed even though you could tell the restaurant was filled with regulars. Straight forward menu, everything is the same price except the daily special, did I say unpretentious?  Not fast but friendly and GREAT food, no ambiance but friendly and GREAT food. We haven't tried everything on the menu yet, however:
Fried Chicken 10
Chicken Fried Steak 10 (gravy was wonderful)
Catfish 10
Mixed greens 10
Rice & gravy 8 (sometimes not as hot as it should be)
Green beans & Taters 10
Black eyed peas 8
Corn bread 10
Mac & Cheese 3 (sorry).

Great food from fine folks since 1964!"}
{"text":"I spent many formative years in Eastern North Carolina & I can certainly appreciate some good home cooking - this place definitely satisfies that craving. I had the most amazing smother/friend pork chops (their seasoning is delish), mixed greens & black eyed peas - sweet tea and the only reason I can't give more stars is because they were out of the peach cobbler I have heard so many great things about - however, the apple pie I had instead was definitely yummy. I plan to make this a reg spot once I move uptown - :)"}
{"text":"Actually found this place on Yelp! while reviewing another place. Saw all the good stuff said about the place so I gave it a shot since it is real hard to find soul-food in Arizona. Granted when I hit the parking-lot there wasn't a car out there besides a couple of vehicles parked near the back for the staff. When I walked in, the place was empty except for this kindly older gentleman who sat at the counter reading the paper, I assumed he was the owner or had something to do with restaurant because he greeted us as we walked thru the door. Turns out he was a customer like myself but must have been a regular as he played with the kid behind the counter and talked with staffed as they worked. Now remember I said it was empty but as soon as we placed our order it kinda started getting busy and when they brought our meals I seen why. I had the catfish with greens and red beans and rice as my sides. Mrs. White's hit me with 3 big pieces of catfish piping hot and crunchy on the outside flaky on the inside, and a big bowl of red beans and rice which were good with a hit of sweetness to them, never had red beans with a hint of sweet like that and then put me down with a big side of greens. My Wife had the fried chicken with mac&cheese and yams as her sides and she loved it! Needless to say neither one of us could finish had to get take home trays. Could not believe the portions for the money we paid! If you want the \"Itis\" this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Like most people in the restaurant last week, we saw them on travel channel. They have a lot to learn about customer service and cleanliness: not clearing plates while customers were waiting for dessert (up to 15 minutes). There were no paper towels in the bathroom and crumbs \"from the night before cause no one's sat there today.\"  No thanks."}
{"text":"We called in an order from Scottsdale and when we arrived we were not pleased. Not only was our order not ready, they were out of the item we ordered - chicken fried steak. When we chose the second option, the fried fish, we were told they were out of that option too. The owner was at the store shopping. Jamal told us that we could get a steak burger so we agreed. After offering free drinks while we waited, we paid and left. When we checked our order in the car, the order that was ready was incorrect. We ordered the three piece chicken dinner with an extra piece on the side. We went back into the store only to be told that we weren't charged for the chicken and that we'd have to wait... Again. Jamal came out of the kitchen and asked if we wanted a big wing... That's not what we asked for. After waiting an additional 15 minutes to cook one piece of chicken, Jamal tells the waiter, from the kitchen, that we didn't pay the $2.50 for the piece of chicken.... Like are you serious??? Jamal then told us that he had to cook in the kitchen because the cook had to pick up her kid from school... Like we didn't have plans....

Not only did they get out order wrong, we had to wait TWICE and they had the NERVE to ask for an additional $2.50?!?! 

I really like Mrs. White's but this is THE worst service I've experienced.

Lessons learned: 
1. Don't order ahead.
2. Check your order.
3. If you place a to go order, make sure you know what they are serving THAT day."}
{"text":"Pork chops are off the chain good. nice staff and the gravy and rice keep you happy"}
{"text":"Posh to anyone who rates this place anywhere below 5-stars. Mrs. White is a sweetheart. The passion of everyone in the kitchen comes through in all their dishes. I have had just about everything on the menu, at least once, and find that it is still worth the drive, no matter how far out of the way I am to indulge in some of that delicious home cooking. Peach cobbler is an amazing aperitif when there's room or if any is left. However, it does not travel by plane well as we very messily found out one afternoon."}
{"text":"in the words spoken by Aretha Franklin (one of my favorite singers) from the movie the Blues Brothers:  \"best damn chicken in the state!\"  Sweet potatoes perfect, green beans/potatoes outstanding and the chicken........WOW DELISH!  I drive from Scottsdale because we just don't have it out here. oh and the corn bread is great.

To drink I had sweet tea, yikes, it was sweet but worth it.  They also have kool-aide.  Heads up no alcohol."}
{"text":"I loved eating here! It's VERY casual and the servers are super friendly. They made us feel very at home and did an awesome job. I think we tipped them a little more than 30%. The food is delicious, but very unhealthy. Don't go here if you're on a diet of any kind - I'm guessing that it is all very high in sodium, fat, etc. If you're in the mood for a treat, or if you love Southern food like me, it is perfect. I had the fried chicken, which was pretty good, and my date had the smother pork chop. I wouldn't recommend the pork chop (it was pretty tough) but I would absolutely 100% recommend the smothered chicken. They gave us a piece of smothered chicken with the pork and that was delicious. The restaurant itself isn't exactly beautiful, but the food is tasty and inexpensive and the service is wonderful."}
{"text":"My dad first showed me this restaurant when I was around 10. 20 years later and I am still in love with their catfish. Today I had the chicken for the first time in a few years. Still delicious, but it wasn't as flavorful. However, the blackeyed peas and cabbage haven't changed. This makes me happy since they are my staple sides. The only reason I can't give a five star is the last two times I have been, it hasn't been the same quality that I once found to be so consistent. However, the service has been just as warm and friendly since I first walked into this unique Phoenix establishment."}
{"text":"The chicken and sweet potatoes were good. The corn bread was terrible. I loved their cornbread years ago and couldn't wait to eat it when my co-workers went for lunch. It was terrible and stale. It is definitely not the same. Me and my co-workers went for lunch and placed a to go order. Normally I check my order before leaving anywhere but they put all 4 of our boxes in the same bag so I didn't get to check the food. I got to work and one of my sides where missing so I called to let them know. They asked the people who packed the orders if they forgot my side as if they didn't believe me and didn't even apologize all they said is \"oh ya you can come get it\". So me and my co-worker went back to go get the side and she ran in and I stayed outside with the car running. She said the lady in the front was extremely rude and rolled her eyes. She did not even offer to help or say sorry. I will not be back especially for a $15.00 meal that comes with an attitude."}
{"text":"Only giving one star because no stars are not an option. Food was horrible very bland! I have never tasted cabbage so bad! They literally just cut some cabbage up, cooked it and served it like that. Say far away from the cabbage.. Not was seasoned good at all

The staff was nice that's probably the only good thing I can say about this place! Besides the fact that a lady came outside in the rain to tell me the other lady in wanted me because she didn't charge me right! I go back in and she says I owe her .82 cent! WTF!!!!! I even tipped them a few dollars. I ordered my food to go which took forever! What a bad first impression! I will never go back to this place or recommended it. I spent $42 on two regular meals and a kids meal. I probably took 4 bites of the food!!! 
Lo Lo's is wayyyy better!!!!!!!!"}

{"text":"This is not good soul food. I would not recommend. Service was okay, but the flavor of the food... isn't there. Yams taste canned. Baked mac and cheese didn't taste authentic and was very salty instead of cheesy. My cornbread was hard as a rock and burnt. The catfish I must admit was very good. Overall, I would recommend LoLo's over this any day. Also, the man that took my order didn't come back to my table to see how everything was. I just moved here from Chicago and this was just a disappointment."}
{"text":"My first soul food experience and I'm hooked! Had the smothered fried chicken, black eyed peas, mixed greens, and fried okra. Everything was fantastic and I was most surprised by the greens. Super tasty. We'll be back again the next time were downtown."}
{"text":"Before I moved downtown I had never heard of this place.
Chicken... Seriously.
I really don't need to talk about any of the other items on the menu but everything I have eaten has been amazing. But the chicken is unlike any other fried chicken i have ever had. It is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The badder they use is fried to perfection and expertly seasoned.
This small yellow building could pass you if you are not looking for it but please trust me when I say, you will regret not eating here."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for years!  I just want to say that it takes a lot for me to complain or for that matter to write a negative review...I would rather not say anything at all.  You know...that whole \"if you have nothing nice to say don't say anything at all\" rule!  That being said...we were so disappointed.  Customer service was hit and miss...the waiter was nice enough...the waitress was...ummm... lets say rough around the edges.  As for the food....seriously bland.  Not gross....but not good by any means.  Mediocre at best.  Some cornbread showed up out of the blue when we were almost done with our meals.  The waitress seemed  offended that we didnt eat much of it.  Oh well...we will be marking this one off the list.  : /"}
{"text":"First time customers--came for their famous Catfish. Excellent--not disappointed! Definitely will return to try Fried Chicken soon, and bring friends.

{"text":"It's not 5 star dining but it's exactly what I was looking for. Some good food with a simple menu, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Don't come here. They are out of everything by 6pm. Staff seemed angry the place was full. Pork chop was cooked enough for a whole pig."}
{"text":"Can't get enough ... Taste like grandmas cooking 

My order -catfish (which is to die for) 
Mixed greens & Mac & cheese DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"Tried their 3pc fried chicken with colliard greens and green beans with potatoes.  Wife had the same but with mac and cheese.  In a word, \"fantastic\".  Reasonable prices, too.  Wish they had white bread as neither of us can stand corn bread.  This place is a winner."}
{"text":"We ordered the fried and smothered chicken, chicken fried steak and smothered pork chops. Everything was delicious - fresh and cooked to perfection. All the sides an cornbread were great."}
{"text":"I recently recommended Mrs Whites to a couple of co-workers from the south, and I made a PROPHECY! I said, \"don't eat this shit at work! You will go into a food coma and take the best nap of your life afterward!\"

They didn't listen. And the food coma got them fired. Well it didn't, but they were so useless the rest of the day that they should have gone home anyways. 

Chicken that could drowned a baby with it's juiciness! OH SO GOOD! Red beans, rice and gravy that made my heart beg for mercy after my blood pressure shot up to like, a million over eight hundred thousand...in a good way though. If you've ever gotten the meat sweats, it's a similar feeling. You finish eating, completely satisfied and relaxed, and then THE FUCKING FEVER COMES!! I don't think your body can handle what just got absorbed through your intestines, so it flips out. I went into fight or flight mode, hard, and I didn't come down until I slept it off like a food drunk little baby. 

Like J.C.M. said, it hurt so good."}
{"text":"This place used to be so good, not anymore.  We went on sunday and waited an hour for dry small fried chicken.  They were out of many items we ordered.  We felt very bad for the server who had to deal with many customers."}
{"text":"I have read some pretty negative and hateful comments about this place.   I personally liked this place and will return.  Coming here, you can see there is zero ambiance, but its the food that counts.  I know when I walked in the ambiance would suck.... Service wasn't the greatest.  What counts for me is the food. Portions were huge. My plate overflowed.  I ordered  fried chicken and boyfriend had catfish.  Both were extremely delicious.  Had a homemade quality and much better than fast food.  I will return and try other dishes.  Don't expect great service and don't expect the prettiest place to sit, expect good home cooked food. I think we were supposed to get corn bread but it never came either...."}
{"text":"Smothered porkchop was great. Environment reminds me of a country old joint mom and pops shop. I reccomend.  Very authentic look n originality"}
{"text":"Don't let the façade fool you!  Mrs. Whites serves up some good home cooking.  My go to dish is the veggie platter, no mac, no rice, and two chicken wings on the side.  The veggie platter consists of every side dish Mrs. White serves.  The usual is mixed greens, cabbage, green beans and red potatoes, red beans, black-eyed peas, and yams.  Comes with corn bread.  The chicken platter comes with three pieces of chicken and two sides.  I would recommend either platter.  I get the Tiger Woods to drink.  A thirst busting concoction of red Kool-Aid, lemonade, and unsweet tea.  The lunch time crowd is a little daunting so go for a late lunch with plenty of seating."}
{"text":"overpriced for overfried food. We went about an hour before closing and they took forever to bring food. just no customer service it was like you were inconvience to them being there.. I'm sure at one time this place was great at one time but no longer."}
{"text":"He confidently pushed the menu to the edge of the table with a hand calloused, wrinkled and bent by time and years of hard work fixing cars and pushing brooms. \"I don't need the menu. I have been coming here for 30 years and they have the best chicken fried steak I have had in my life.\"

\"Hey, I know better than to doubt you, grandpa.\" replied the young man with the same face, minus 40 years and 30 lbs but with the benefit of an extra 4 inches in height.

The old man ordered a lemonade to wash it down and the kid took a sweet tea, both ariving in giant plastic cups that reminded the kid, now nearly 30 of his childhood summers spent with his family in El Paso,Texas with his father's family who had moved with the army from Mississippi many years before he was born but brought the traditions of cooking for taste and comfort and damned be anyone for telling them it wasn't healthy.

They sat quietly, tired from a morning of moving furniture into the young man's new home, reading the signatures on the wall. The old man pointed out and explained who some of the old-timers were, mostly polititians and actors who, while big in their day, were not legendary enough to cary into the vernacular of pop culture 30 years later, and the young man pointing out and explaining the athletes and musicians of his era.

The waiter dropped off their chicken fried steaks along with their sides: Red beans, rice with gravy, greens and potatoes. They grinned in acknowledement of having made the right choices and began to eat.

\"You know, her son opened a chicken and waffle place not too far from here.\" ther kid said, \"but you are right; this place is better. Thanks for your help today grandpa.\""}
{"text":"WHAT???!! You don't serve breakfast????

I'll be back for dinner and update my post!"}
{"text":"This place is truly amazing! I had always heard about how good it was and finally had the opportunity to eat here the other night before attending a show at the Orpheum. I went with the Fried Chicken and had the rice-gravy and mac & cheese as my sides. With the complimentary corn bread to go with it you can't go wrong. The service was very good and I will hopefully be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"Someone PLEASE explain to me why this place gets written up as one of Phoenix's best. So disappointing! 

I was really eager to try it out. My husband and I stopped in one Friday night hoping for some kick-ass Southern (he's a Southern boy, I've eaten in joints all over the South). We got a waitress who was dumber than a sofa cushion (bless her heart) who took our order verbally, then had to come back and ask what we'd ordered. I suggested that she get a pad and write it down. She still screwed it up. We waited ... and waited ... and waited ... and finally asked for some cornbread to keep the ol' blood sugar up. Took three times asking the server and the cook who also seemed to be a server. Oy. So heavy if it fell off the table it would kill the cat.

He had the chicken-fried steak, a favorite of his. He gave it a 3 out of 10. At least it was hot. He gave the sweet potatoes higher marks, but was put off by the amount of liquid butter in the bowl (and this is a man not afraid of butter).

My pork chops were lukewarm, bland and tough - they reminded me of the old Shake N Bake, except they had no seasoning that I could discern. I'd asked for the gravy on the side; it was okay, like something you'd make at home. But it took four requests for a spoon, and then I got up and went to the counter to ask for one. What really chapped my britches was the rice: plain white rice, like Uncle Ben's Converted, with not a speck of flavor. No seasoning, not even salt that I could taste. I was having school cafeteria flashbacks.

Okay, the cole slaw was respectable, but I've had just as good from a grocery store kit.

Atmosphere is supposed to be quaint and authentic - I call it grubby and beat-up, and not in a cool, hot 'n happening way.

Go to Welcome Diner if you want good, cheap Southern-inspired food, or if you don't mind a bit higher check, go to Lolo's Chicken & Waffles (which, BTW, is owned by the grandson of Mrs. White)."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know how anyone can rate this restaurant more than 1 star.  We saw this restaurant featured on Check Please Arizona and being from the south, we were excited to try it.  I decided to take my husband there for his birthday.  Let me start off with the review of the food - it was terrible.  The chicken was greasy, and had no flavor.  The sides were as bad as a school cafeteria.  But the service is even worse!  We arrived around 1:30 on a Saturday.  There were 2 large tables of people and a few other tables but still lots of empty tables (the place is pretty small).  We chose a table in the back - huge mistake, because it reeked of the smells from the bathroom.  But I wanted to try to stay positive since it was my husband's birthday.  We waited only a few minutes before a waiter came by to give us menus and get our drink order.  We ordered non-sweet tea - however, we got one sweet and one non-sweet, we were able to get that remedied, but when the waiter came back to give us the tea, he wouldn't take our order even though we said we were ready.  He said he had to get a pencil and paper and would be back. Well, he didn't come back for almost 45 minutes!  That's not to say he wasn't around, when the large table's food was ready, the brought out the plates one by one - several minutes apart.  Several other tables came in during this time, while we were still waiting to order, he actually took he new tables orders before ours!  Finally, I spoke up next time he was in our vicinity and told him we still hadn't ordered.  Even after this, it took him about 10 minutes to come back!  We should have walked out, but now it was a mission to see how long it would take.  After we ordered, we waited again.  At some point, a man came out and asked a table near us, but who had came in well after us, how long they had been waiting, and this nice lady told him that our table had been waiting longer than hers.  Turns out, they got their food before we did!  In fact several tables that came in after us got food before us.  Finally, we got our food and let me say that I have had better fried chicken from KFC - I actually think they might have gotten the chicken from KFC, because I don't remember the smell of chicken frying in the restaurant.  And of course they got our sides wrong.  At the end of our meal, a lady came by again to the table near us and apologized for the delay and asked if she could provide a dessert on the house, again the nice lady customer informed the employee that in fact we had been there much longer than them, The employee then just looked at us and reluctantly came to our table and asked us if we wanted dessert.  Having lived in the south, I am familiar with racial tensions, and I have read the other Yelpers mentioning the disparity of service for non-dark customers, this place is worse than anything I have ever experienced.  Two hours waiting for a lunchtime meal!  That's CRAZY!  I felt unwelcome and unimportant to the business.  I will never go there again.  And after all of that, it was $34.00!!  Maybe they charge by the number of minutes you occupy the table?  I think I owe my husband another birthday dinner...."}
{"text":"The original chicken that started it all and spun off LoLos. Amazing, quirky, hole in the wall. Bad staff, lousy seats, super slow service...it's all part of the, charm? Always. Love it."}
{"text":"This place was off the hook with Flavor. Takes a while to get the fried chicken as they cook to order. Very rustic place, it is family owned.  The mixed greens were SOOO full of Flavor and the Black eyed peas were some of the best I've ever had. I left there totally stuffed. Nice portions. Many NFLers, MLBers, and musicians have signed the walls. Cool reading."}
{"text":"The food was great! I am sorry grandma, but Mrs. White has got you beat. The fried chicken is incredible and the sweet potatoes and  greens were fabulous. Its not a fancy place, but the service is great and they made me feel welcome. I left stuffed and happy!"}
{"text":"My wife nd I went to Mrs. Whites yesterday for lunch. My wife had the fried chicken, candied yams and macaroni and cheese. She said the fried chicken was excellent and the candied yams were the best she ever had. I had the smothered pork chops and cabbage. The pork chop was absolutely wonderful. We had sweet tea and lemonade to drink both were outstanding. I would go back for sure. My only complaint was the place is a little dirty it would be nice if they would clean the tables, sweep the floor and  just do a little better job of cleaning. I was thinking if they did such a terrible job of cleaning the front of the house I wonder how thorough they are in washing the plates cups and utensils."}
{"text":"Great greens, sweet potatoes, and Mac and cheese.  Chicken was flavorful and crispy but unfortunately dry."}
{"text":"Visited again but seemed the menu is limited during the weekday."}
{"text":"If I could give minus stars I would. The service there is the ABSOLUTE WORST!!!!!!

Now I am in the middle of packing to move to Portland but I am taking the time out to write this review because this is how bad this place is. I have been to Mrs. Whites on several occasions and the service has always been pretty crappy but today took the cake. 

Breakdown of events:

1.Call in my order at 5:30pm. The woman that answered the phone had no business telephone etiquette at all. 

2. Arrive at Mrs. Whites after going through the maze of the light rail and one way traffic...I digress that is not their fault. Anyway I walk in and I am cheerfully greeted by a young lady that is sweeping. A woman (I am sure the one that answered when I called is on the phone). She is on the phone with her boyfriend calling him out for cheating on her. Using all sorts of profanity while doing so. 

3. I state that I am there for the to go order and that is it. No one says it will be a few more mins or anything. Now mind you I live on 10th St & Camelback so travel time to Mrs. Whites should have been sufficient time to prepare...fried fish, mac and cheese and mixed greens. 2 of the 3 dishes are cooked already I am sure. 

4. I wait for about 10 mins when a older gentleman that works there reminds the phone lady that I am waiting for my order. I assume she is the cook. Well phone lady never even started my order. She did not start my order until 10 mins after I walked in the door and she was done calling out her boyfriend on the phone.

5. In my 30 mins of sitting and waiting. There were 5 employees there and the owner was one of them. He did not acknowledge me or anything and sat across from me watching tv and then left. Why does it take close to and hour to make my order with that many people there in the kitchen?

6. My food finally arrives, only to be dropped down in front of me...no words...just nothing. So I leave my  $10.18 for my meal as it states on the website since nobody came to take my money. Bad enough I have to wait for my food but I be da@#$ed if I will wait for you to come take my money. So I left. 

7. I barely get my foot in the car and phone lady is out the back door saying that I did not pay the total for my meal. I said that the website said the meals were $10.18. She tells me that the price on the site is wrong the meals are now $14+. So I give the extra $4. Now why could she have not been that quick with making my food?

So save yourself the time and headache of this place. It is not worth it. I don't care how many celebrities or what Food Network show they were on. I have been to plenty of famous soul food places in Harlem NYC and never would anything like this ever happen.  

If you have a jones for some soul food check out Lo Lo's in Scottsdale. The food is basically the same and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Good Lord!!! Good greasy, grandma tasting, filling, soul food. Seriously good. The items are made daily so it's likely your favorite dish maybe be sold out by time evening comes. 

My significant other and I had Mrs. Whites Monday night. He was craving something filling and filling, I wanted Mac and cheese. 

On a Monday there were about 5 couples dining, including us. I ordered smothered chicken with Mac and cheese and green beans win potatoes. It came with 3 huge pieces of chicken. He ordered ox tails, sweet potatoes, and rice and gravy. Both dishes came with cornbread. The ox tails were cooked to perfection, very little fat, very meaty. OMG!!! Delicious!! I've probably had Mrs. Whites only 3 times since I've been in the valley (almost 3 years). It's definitely something you shouldn't be eating all the time, but when you want some go ole fashioned, filling soul food. You better head to Mrs. Whites."}
{"text":"well here is the thing...i have had some damn good soul food coming from la..the thing is i read the lots of reviews and so i went there with an open mind. ok i get there hard to find but once found ample parking in there lot and it was packed during lunch hour. i wanted the oxtails but all they had were chops and chicken. so chicken it is...very tasty, and crunchy. the sides were yams which were griss and canned for sure. the greens had sugar in them and i could not stomach them. the peach cobbler had just come out the oven. guess what? they burned it! the bottom was black! the inside was doughy. this is not good except the chicken. but than again i went to her sons spot ..lolo's chicken & waffles and it wasnt good.:(  if your ever in los angeles...go to m&m soul food and roscoes chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by my chiropractor...we were coming from an event downtown and were talking about soul food and peach cobbler...he said that i should try Mrs. Whites and I was like ok lets go!  It is definitely not fancy but that is ok...its not meant to be...I love smothered chicken so when I saw it that is what I ordered!  It was awesome...then I was super excited for the peach cobbler and the owner said there was only tomato cobbler...I was like WTF?? Tomato cobbler?  He was like I bet that you will like it just as much or more then the peach cobbler...I was in the mood to try something new so I said bring it out...lol...they brought it out with ice cream on it...and it was nice and warm...I was still skeptical...I had never heard of such a thing!  I took my first bite and i was in heaven it was AMAZING!!  I cleaned the bowl!  I then apologized to the owner for doubting him...I still to this day have never had a tomato cobbler but I will always remember that it was awesome! This is not the place to go if you are on a diet...but try it...its right near downtown..."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed. I've come here several times but my last two times were terrible. 
Last time my Mac and cheese taste burnt and my greens tasted like someone accidentally dropped all the salt in them.
This time I was charged for two sides but didn't get my second side (Mac and cheese).
Sucks cause when the food is good, it's good. This place is just hit or miss."}
{"text":"Ahhhh.... the fried pork chops. I hadn't been to Mrs White's in about 5 years and was pleased to see that fame hasn't gone to anyone's head in there. Still the same wonderful homemade, fresh food that it's always been, served in the same comfortable atmosphere. I was surprised when the server handed me a menu, but happy to see that my old standbys - pork chops, cabbage and black-eyed peas - were still there and just the same. Yes, it's slow, but good homemade food takes time, people! Nothing here is microwaved, frozen or pre-prepared. It's exactly what \"soul food\" is supposed to be... food that feeds your soul. Thank you, Mrs. White's, for keeping it real."}
{"text":"yes, yes yes. Exactly what I was hoping it would be. I've been waiting to try this spot for a  VERY long time, but wifey doesn't eat fried chicken much but a friend invited us so it was a perfect time to check it out. It's exactly what I expected in a Soul Food restaurant. Small, friendly and great food. Now I will say to bring a bushel of patience with you as everything moves kind of slow here but that's okay with me, I came knowing that so no issue. The menu items are all $13 and you get your main dish and 2 sides. I went with the fried chicken with mac and cheese and mixed greens. Wifey had the Chicken Fried Steak, okra gumbo (awesome!) and mac and cheese. They also brought out fresh corn bread. Not my thing, but wifey really liked it. I also was able to get a big ole glass of Kool Aid with my meal, score!  The chicken was super fresh, juicy and perfectly seasoned. The greens and mac and cheese were also done to perfection. All in all, a text book Southern meal. I'll for sure be back when I'm in the mood. Nicely done Mrs. Whites, you have a new fan"}
{"text":"I've heard such amazing things about this place that I couldn't wait to try it.  I finally did and it was okay.  The service was sub par.  Waitstaff were chewing food while serving my drink. They ran out of food and forgot our cornbread.  I liked the lively crowd.  Location is tough to get to with all the one way streets.  I probably will not go back."}
{"text":"This place has the best fried chicken in town. The chicken fried steak, smothered pork chops, and fried catfish are also favorites. The sides are great also, my favorites are the black eyed peas and greens. The cornbread is sooo good here, it just melts in your mouth. Try the home made lemonaid, it is very good. 
Service can be slow at times but it is worth the wait! 
This place fills up so you have to get there early or you might have to wait for a table.  
Remember it is cash only."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times over the past 6 years and absolutely loved the food every time.  Never had better fried pork chops anywhere...sweet potatoes are awesome too!  I've been bragging about this place to my family out of state for years....while the family was in town yesterday, we stopped in for lunch anticipating a wonderful meal.  There were only two booths seated when we arrived...the two young men that waited on us were pleasant and attentive, but the meal we got was just ok.  The moist succulent (fried) pork chops were not either.  Typically you get two nice bone in center cut pork chops that are juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  What we got were two chops (one boneless chop and one super thin bone in chop). One was tasty and one like jerky.  Sweet potatoes and greens were great, gravy on rice was watery and flavorless, same with potatoes and green beans.  Corn bread was served cold and chewy, not made that day.  Things have changed and not for the better....they have never been known for their service, but the food had been so good I was willing to overlook this.  I hope this was just a fluke and the once wonderful food returns soon!"}
{"text":"Came today for lunch w a co-worker...SOOOO DELICIOUS!!!  The place is a cute little restaurant w lots of personal photos, writing on the wall; very cool to see all those who have eaten and left reviews on the wall!!  For lunch we both had southern fried chicken but we chose different sides.  She had the cabbage and red beans/rice, I had the mixed greens (collard and spinach) and the green beans/potatoes.  Both were served w corn bread.  I had iced tea, she had koolaid.  

The food was FANTASTIC!!!  Everything we ate was soulful, delicious, and comforting to the max!!  On top of that, service was great!  Our waiter mentioned he was there alone today and he was BUSY.  He kept our glasses full and kept us informed...he was fantastic.  

This is likely the best place I've eaten in months, for sure the best of its kind in Phoenix.  A definite must!"}
{"text":"I walked to this restaurant from my hotel, on the advice of www.roadfood.com, for carry-out. I love soul food, and had the St. Louis Sweetie Pie's standard in my background by way of comparison. Sweetie Pie's is much better, faster, and cheaper. I had the chicken, which was good. I also ordered collard greens and green beans. The collard greens were excellent, but the green beans were pale and mushy, as if they'd come from a can. The restaurant wasn't crowded, so I was able to observe a customer at the counter successfully negotiating with the restaurant staff for free carry-out food for her family function. Meanwhile, that same staff forgot that I had already paid for my food, and tried to charge me twice. I had paid in cash and had been given no receipt or bill, so I couldn't begin to prove my honesty in the matter. A little uncomfortable, needless to say."}
{"text":"Yes! I am giving it a 1 star. 

I think I am a bit biased though because I have had Sweetie Pie's (being as I'm from STL) so I know good soul food PLUS my aunt owns a bakery and is a awesome cook when it comes to southern food. 

This place? Absolutely NOT! The meals should NOT be 15 a plate.. it's not worth it at all. People always put this place on a high pedal stool and I don't know why. Me and my BF decided to try this place on a whim and I was greatly disappointed. I got the smothered pork chops... cold, bland, and looked old. Let's not even get on the corn bread... super dry! I seriously don't think this place is worth 15 bucks a plate. 


On the other hand Lo Lo's (DOWNTOWN location) it's GOOD! So good when my cousin was in town for a day I suggested this place of ALL places I know. And she is a harsh critic but she approved! I know for a fact she would not approve of this place. Neither do I. 

Thing is... this place is owned by Ms. White and Lo Lo's is owned by I think her grandson or something so you would THINK the food and the way it taste would kinda coincide."}
{"text":"This place was great!!!  Yelp led me here & I'm soooo glad.  Had fried chicken that was moist but crunchy outside. Mac and cheese w/mixed greens were the perfect sides. Young gentleman w/braids did a great job.  Can't wait to take my husband back to try pork chops & fish before we head back home to FL."}
{"text":"Stopped by one day with a friend on mine because we wanted to try some good soul food. I ordered chicken, pork chops and Mac and Cheese. First off the Mac tasted like it came from a frozen package. My chicken, I couldn't tell what piece it was. My boy was like \"Is that a chicken back?\" People trip me out me when they say this is the best soul food. This stuff come from boxes. I'd rather take the drive and get some real HOME COOKED soul food from The AZ FRY GUY in Avondale! No out of the box crap there!"}
{"text":"My son and I were downtown and I decided to introduce him to Mrs. Whites, a place I had not been to in several decades. We ordered the fried chicken and the pork chops. We never got any cornbread. I got maccaroni rather than the requested rice and gravy. The photos on the menu implied a pair of bone in chops rather than the boneless pieces of dry pork loin in a flavorless crust I was served, one at a time. The fried chicken was inconsistent in that some parts were rare and others overcooked! Finally we were charged an additional 70 cents for the luxury of using a credit card. So the meal was $13 a plate plus two and change each for weak sweet tea and lemonade. The biggest waste of $38 in recent memory. The servers were surly and disinterested. Mrs. White would be embarrassed at what has transpired since her departure. 
I long for the days in the 70's when Lucille's Soul Food Cafe was on Washington with her 'real deal' oxtails and genuinely delicious food. This place is the WORST!"}
{"text":"Down Home in Phoenix!
Be prepared for some culture shock and forget about your diet for the day.

Great southern cooking in a funky building... interesting atmosphere, with customer graffiti on the walls.

Worth a try for the experience!"}
{"text":"Want authentic soul food? This is the place for it. We had a great time - the food was amazing, loved seeing all the writing on the walls, and the staff was super friendly. This place is a repeat to me for sure!"}
{"text":"Service kind of sucks. You'll definitely be hungry while waiting for your food but it well worth the wait. Menu is simple and easy to navigate. Two sides come with anything you want on the menu. Anything you desire comes with the same price. I like their motto , \" Food is not cheap because cheap food is not good.\""}
{"text":"The food is downright down home good southern cooking. But don't expect any frills... At all. 
If you get an $8 sandwich, it's just a piece of bone-in chicken on a slice of bread. Nothing else at all. But this is some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. The chicken fried steak was also delicious! Can't say much for the sides.

It's a hole in the wall with graffiti everywhere. I think they've kind of made that they're thing, just letting people write on the walls. It was probably meant to be artistic but it just looks trashy.

Come for the food, and the people are pretty friendly too :-)"}
{"text":"Stopped by one Sunday morning around 11am.  I was the first customer there so I was looking forward to fast service and hot food.  I ordered the chicken, sweet potatoes, mac and cheese with cornbread.  The chicken was great, crunchy nicely seasoned and the portion was large.  Thus the 2 stars.  Everything else was unimpressive, mac and cheese was not creamy, potatoes were off, still cant put my finger on what it was but not good.  The cornbread was dry and had no flavor.  The atmosphere was blah, looked dirty, and the food should have made up for it and didn't.  Can't say I will try it again."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!!  This place left me feeling fat & happy!!  We originally were heading some place else, they were closed, then we headed to a second option which had an hour & 1/2 wait, so third time's a charm, and we found Mrs. White's!!  This place is an old, small, mom & pop diner, but the love in the kitchen is there.  Everyone was friendly, from the guy in the parking lot taking a break, to the wait staff, & even the cook came out to see how everything was.  The most fantastic, rib sticking, cornbread came with the meal.  We ordered catfish, green beans, mac n' cheese, smothered pork chops, gravy n' rice, fried okra, & a hot link.  Everthing came out hot, hot, hot & was delicious!  My boyfriend even finished my plate.  We will definitely be visiting again.  The food was 4.75 stars - I didn't care for my rice & gravy.  My only con of this place was the decor felt dirty, & the bathrooms were hot as hell.  I didn't mind the graffiti signed walls, it gives the place character & allows the patrons to participate in a little bit of history.  I can't wait to go back & try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"I wish there could be negative stars because this place would receive probably a -2. It's perhaps the most disappointing dining experience of my life. The food wasn't good. The service was worse. I really don't have the words to describe how awful our experience here was. How this place keeps making must visit lists is beyond me. No joke Churches is a better fried chicken experience, at least you don't have to wait 45 minutes for slop."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!!!  I am a very picky fried chicken person--- Mrs. White's is hands down the best chicken I have ever had!!  LOVE it!  The mixed greens for my side were also very yummy!  I'll be back often, thanks to the awesome staff that made my visit absolutely heavenly!  :)"}
{"text":"Nothing friendly about  the staff to start. I came here ordered Togo, food took forever. I guess  I should've  checked  it before  I got home  because  there was half a spoon full of each side. But I should've  known  better  considering  the dirty looks from the counter person when walked in. Funny thing is a semi famous  celebrity  comes in and gets his food in five mins flat.  Had the waiter actually  done his job he would've gotten  a good tip but I left him $2 anyway as he was more helpful  then the asshole old man at the counter.  Never again"}
{"text":"MMM, southern fried chicken... but I was really disappointed that they didn't have a boneless option.  Unfortunately, I can't each meat off a bone, so no chicken for me :(

I loved the unsweetened iced tea!  It had such a good flavor.

They did have a vegetarian option, a vegetable plate that came with all the vegetables.  The portion was huge.  The flavor of all the vegetables wasn't the greatest; it was rather bland.  Plus, I noticed standing water at the bottom of the plate, so I'm not sure if the veggies were drained properly.  

They accept credit cards, but only Visa and MasterCard."}
{"text":"I have vascillated on Mrs. White's for a few years now. Today's visit sealed the deal for me on why I won't return. 

I got a to-go order of fried chicken, black eye peas and rice with gravy (since they were out of mac & cheese at 11:30 am). As I waited for my order, I watched several plates of chicken being delivered to customers eating in. The pieces were so huge they were half falling off the plates and towering above them. I looked forward to the same as I drove home, especially since I paid $14.81 for my lunch- and that did not include a beverage. Imagine my dismay as I opened my box at home and discovered three tiny pieces of underseasoned not-so-fresh tasting chicken. What the hell? You give the sit down customers the best you have to offer because they might complain otherwise? You give me some bullshit chicken because I am doing carryout? The peas were mush, the rice & gravy was bland, and the cornbread was overdone on the outside and heavy and underdone inside. I guess you're overcharging your customers to bank-roll your retirement, which will surely come sooner rather than later since I can't imagine how you're keeping customers."}
{"text":"Went about 3 years ago and I have not considered going back! Just nasty to me. Enough said!"}
{"text":"Okay, I was born in southern Indiana and my best fried chicken originates with the aunts, grandmothers and mom who knew how to cook fried chicken!  This chicken reminded me of some of the best I have ever tasted.  The porkchop was VERY good also (I had the combo meal) and my cornbread, redbeans and rice, and the sweet potatoes were all quite good.  Service was polite, quick and attentive.  The sweet tea was refilled several times and on time, and overall I enjoyed the meal.  In read with interest some of the recent 'poor' reviews and have to assume that they just have good days and bad days...hard to say, but I was definitely here on a good day.  I hope you experience is like mine and if it's not...sorry, but they CAN do great chicken!!"}
{"text":"Never again.  The actual restaurant was absolutely filthy and the staff was super slow and had an excuse for why everything was behind.  I sat in a booth that was broken and everything on the menu, magazines, picture frames, table, and wall that butted up against the table had grease splattered all over them ...yuck.  The walls were dirty.   

The entree food was very greasy and tasted mediocre.  The piping hot temperatures took away from the flavor.  The peach cobbler was tasty, but not necessarily any better than how one might expect a decent peach cobbler to taste."}
{"text":"Great southern style Soul food. Chicken was moist and the mac-n-cheese was hot and flavorful. Throw away your \"count the calories\" cuz it's all about \"Yea Baby\"! when you take a bite of the chicken."}
{"text":"Lunch: Out of friend chicken. Only pork chops available. Two of the side dishes I wanted to order were \"out\" too. Me thinks not. Didn't order anything. Left and went to LoLo's. 

The owner of LoLo's is Mrs. White's Grandson. At least he knows how to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service, I liked the taste of the fried chicken and pork, it was moist and succulent. The collard greens were good, the macaroni was kind of dry. I think it's a little overpriced, but overall a good experience"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Mrs Whites 3 times and every time the food was amazing and the service was friendly. I got my old co-workers hooked on this place. They were shocked by how good the food was.They continue to come to Mrs. Whites till this day. The fried chicken is the best I've every tasted."}
{"text":"My only southern source of down home food and service. Try the catfish or fried chicken and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Mrs Whites for years now. We would go there as a treat every so often because there food was fantastic. Unfortunately it has really gotten pretty bad in the last year or so. Its really sad to, we loved Mrs Whites but not anymore. 
    The last couple times we went the food was pretty sub par. The portions were much smaller and the quality and taste was rather poor. A couple of times ago we went with myself, my mother and my brother. I dont want this to sound racist but I feel it needs to said. I felt like we were definitely the wrong color to be eating there. 
   The service was ok but i noticed it was much better for the \"locals\" who were there at the same time. We ordered and sat and waited for our meal. I watched as some of the people around me were brought the same thing I had ordered and it looked fantastic. Nice big pieces of chicken with large portions of sides. 
    Well finally our food came and what a disappointment. Our portions were MUCH smaller then everyone elses and the sides were about half the size. My mother ordered catfish, (her favorite thing there) and it looked like it was half a filet. My smothered chicken was 2 very small wings and one small breast, (I had ordered all white meat) and there was very little gravy and cabbage. 
     I went ahead and tried Mrs Whites one last time a couple weeks ago and it was more of the same thing. I ordered the smothered chicken again and when it arrived I received 2 small wings and a back bone with no meat. The table right behind me had the same thing and received 2 large breasts and a nice sized wing. After attempting to eat the skin off the back bone I gave up and ate what little else there was on the plate. My mother did get a nice sized catfish filet but both our sides were very small. 
    I no longer recommend Mrs Whites. It looks like the kids have taken over running the place and I think thats the problem. The gentleman who was always in the kitchen did a wonderful job of making the place a great choice for fantastic food but i dont see him there much anymore. 
   Stay away from Mrs Whites unless you happen to be the right color. Very sad."}
{"text":"Best Fried chicken & gravy! Im from California and I never drive through phoenix and not stop to eat"}
{"text":"Excellent soul food!!  Mrs Whites serves up amazing soul food which gets then 5 stars in my book. There is nothing elegant about the restaurant. The menu was written on the wall with magic marker and their signatures from happy patrons all over the walls. I have been going here for years and I must say that the service has improved drastically and they now also take credit cards which is a plus. I love all of the sides so much that I always order the vegetable plate which consists of as many of the side items as will fit on one plate.  From fried chicken to smothered pork chops to chicken fried steak- it's all delicious.  The cornbread is also outstanding and if you somehow have enough room you can enjoy one of their amazing desserts or give it to go and enjoy it later after you're done with your food coma.  The sweet tea, lemonade, and super sweet koolaid are excellent for washing down the food.  
The transportation and parking situation is a little challenging due to the close proximity to the light rail and the congested downtown area. If you can score a parking spot in their small parking lot that is the way to go. The lunch rush can be difficult and time consuming, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  The real deal!

I was traveling in PHX and someone recommended we try this place out.  We did and went back three times that week.  I was back for a conference and I dragged a group there and they loved it too!

The fried chicken and the breaded pork chops were amazing.  I really enjoyed the mac and cheese and there is nothing like washing it down with a hugh glass of ice cold fruit punch.

I can't wait until my next trip to PHX...this will definitely be a stop!"}
{"text":"I haven't had real, good soul food since I lived in New York and to be honest I never expected to find it in Arizona.  Mrs. White's was stumbled upon by pure happenstance.  A friend that had eaten here before, decided upon the Golden Rule as the best place to eat dinner before seeing the Diamondbacks play.  

The menu is very simple, but that's never a bad thing when the food is as good as they offer here.  I ordered the chicken fried steak, macaroni and cheese, and green beans (with potato).  My order was delivered last out of our group, and the anticipation grew and grew as I saw my friends get their heaping plates of fried deliciousness.  When they placed my plate in front of me the first thing that shocked me was the sheer size of the portions.  Even the rim of the plate was covered in food.  

It was refreshing to see chicken fried steak that wasn't pounded into a flat, tasteless filet.  The breading was crunchy, crispy, and crazy good.  Also excellent was the gravy that covered every inch of the steak.  The green beans were seasoned perfectly, but I do wish there had been more potato included.  And the mac n cheese, forget it.  Creamy, cheesy, a slight crunch thanks to the baking, and perfectly cooked noodles.  Easily the best I've had outside of my own house.  A few dashes of hot sauce over everything and I was in heaven.  

Now I have yet to try Lo-Lo's, which I hear is the best in the valley, but Mrs. White's has set the bar very high.  Very high indeed."}
{"text":"Outside of building is plain and doesn't pull you in but the food was really good! It is soul food and home made fresh as you wait not sitting in a pan waiting to dish up so it takes some time to get your order. I had the chicken fried steak you could cut it with a fork, Mac and cheese that was very creamy and much better then anything I have had in a while, Sweet Potato's that had flavor all the way through soaked into each spud. Yummy I couldn't finish it all there was so much, lots of food for a lunch so be prepared to take home a container. Corn bread was a little dry but you are suppose to use it to soak up your gravy as they do in the south so remember that it is not to be eatin dry as I think most are trying to do.

Staff is not overly friendly but they are not rude by any means. Good home cooked food which are the basics of the southern soul cooking.

If your looking for a high priced upper scale place this is not it! It is home cooked food in a basic diner feel that you would find in Alabama or a small town in Georgia  

Worth stopping by for good home cooked meal done southern style!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best southern-style food in all of Phoenix. I've been here close to 10 times now and there is absolutely no doubt that it's the best. 

I've gotten the chicken fried steak, smothered chicken, pork chops, and catfish before and you absolutely cannot go wrong with any decision. 

With that said, you are coming here for the food, not the venue or the service. The venue is clearly old school, but I think they've avoided changing anything to keep in touch with their historical roots in Phoenix. To my knowledge, this place has been here for decades. 

The service can be a hit or miss. There is a chance you will end up with a server that you'll never see again after you get your food so if you want to get something else or just get your refill you'll be out of luck. However, that is not a reason to not check this place out! I'd highly recommend it just based on the food alone!"}
{"text":"Mrs. White would turn in her grave if she knew her establishment was run so dishonestly. 

I came in with family to Mrs. White's Cafe hoping to get our fill with some authentic soul food. The service was lackluster and very very slow. We weren't greeted warmly as someone had said in the previous reviews instead coldly, we then proceeded to seat ourselves because no one greeted us. 

...15 minutes later after sitting down, a server finally came over and took our drink orders. Then another 30 minutes to get our drinks. Service was very very slow. We sat patiently then the server came around and I asked her were were ready to order. She replied rudely \"I'm the only server tonight so your going to have to wait!\" 

15 percent has just been deducted from her tip I thought in my head.

So wait we did.

Finally, we got to ordering. We ordered 2 catfish ($13 with 2 sides), oxtail ($16+ with tax), 3 drinks ($2.15 each). Food was ok. I've had better soul food having been in the South recently and eating at Chicken Box in Charlotte,NC.

When we finally got around to paying, we never got a check, and were never told we would have to pay at the checkout window.  I asked my mom for my phone to use my calculator because I know I was going into battle (these places usually think money grows out of my ass because they think I'm a stereotypical high maintenance Asian girl). The man at the window totaled our order and charged me $66.00. I begged to differ. I got my handy dandy calculator and we should have been charged $52. He apologized and said he was confused because the server was yelling over him while calculating our order. BS!

Stay AWAY!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!!!! the service wasn't great. They messed up our order multiple times and by the time some of us got our food others had completely finished. Regardless, the food was so good that I STILL give it 4 stars. AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Amazing fried chicken! The staff is friendly and welcoming. They have kids' meals, which include fried chicken, one side (macaroni and cheese was a favorite), and drink.  My kids can't stop raving about it! My chicken fried steak was delicious and the gravy was perfect-smooth and creamy. We will be sure to stop in the next time we are in Phoenix. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Just Like the South

We love your typical meat-and-three type restaurants across the South.  We never expected to find such a place in Arizona.  At Mrs White's, you would think that you were in Nashville or Birmingham.

The fried chicken was delicious and the mixed greens very nice.  I do wish that they had mashed potatoes.

Unfortunately, they had run out of their famous peach cobbler, so we'll have to go back."}
{"text":"We went about 3 pm on a Saturday, place was close to empty. Not sure if that was bc of the heat or recent negative reviews but either way it was nice for us. 

FOOD: I'll start with the most important part, the food!!! For the food alone, 5 stars!! I got the catfish sandwich and cabbage, so delicious. My hubby got fried chicken, mac n cheese, and sweet potatoes. Everything tasted great and the portions where big. My picky 2 year old ate half my catfish and his dads chicken, we were amazed at that alone. As others have said, the food took a long time to come out, about 30 to 45. When it came out, it was hot and fresh. Quality food will only cook so fast so I'm not going to complain too much about the wait.

SERVICE: Staff was prompt, friendly and very polite. Everyone seemed down to earth. To some they may seem a little too laid back which may come off as unprofessional, but we didn't mind. The food is southern style soul food, it isn't suppose to be served by uptight people in a suit and tie. 

ATMOSPHERE: Its a small establishment which is cool but it still could use a little work. Booths were loose and barely enough room under the table. We kept stepping on each others shoes. For people with little kids this may be important. They only had 2 high chairs, both were dirty and could have used a quick wipe down by staff before being put back. Bath room could use a little remodel and felt like a sauna. I washed my hands and ran out. It was also warm in the dinning room. In a triple digit summer quality AC is a must!! 

Overall, we liked it even with some issues here and there. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing. This is one of those, \"Don't judge a book by it's cover\".  The outside may not look like much. But you get that scrumptious food in your mouth and down in your belly, you won't be sorry. 
I had the Southern Fried Chicken. WOW! It was so tender & juicy with a crispy authentic batter. Also had the yams that made me want more & more. This is a MUST. Try it and you'll be craving it again and again."}
{"text":"As I've heard many say before, if your not looking for this place you would easily pass it, and while that is true, I'm glad I was looking for it! This place is a hidden gem, awesome home cooking type would food. If your looking for awesome service with an aesthetically pleasing decor this is not the place. With that said, our server was very polite and attentive despite what some of these other reviews on Yelp have said about the service. Our food came out in a timely manner, especially for items like these that are cooked to order. The fried chicken was fantastic, and authentic to a home cooked soul food meal. The sweet potatoes were great, not too sweet with just a touch of cinnamon and brown sugar flavor. The Smothered pork chips were awesome and my pregnant belly was very very pleased with them! The green beans were also soul food style green beans and exactly what I wanted and would have expected. The mac n cheese was also great, again home cooking soul food style. All these reviews on here that complained about the food looking like slop I think is just silly and clearly they don't understand what home cooking soul food looks like. This is a hole in the wall mom n pop place. Soul food isn't particularly aesthetically pleasing food so to expect it to look like a trendy restaurant in old town's food would look is just silly. Close your eyes and taste the food if you need your food to look like something off of top chef. I enjoy a fun trendy restaurant as much as the next foodie but I also enjoy a hole in the wall mom n pop and this fits that bill. The amount of food you get for the price is awesome, if you think this is pricey then I guess you should stick to the fast food dollar menu. Oh and the kool aid and corn bread was on point as well! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, the best place in Phoenix to go for soul food.  If you have good manners, you'll get good service( yes mam, please, thank you...etc)"}
{"text":"Best friend chicken, greens, cole slaw. Friendly staff a bit slow relaxed service so don't come if you're in a hurry. Completely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Is good to see somethings never change. Mrs Whites makes some of the best chicken and chops in the area. It was great in the 90s and still tastes great today. The service hasn't changed much, still slow. The other tables got drinks before we did. The food was delivered and service didn't ask OR follow up. I had to get up and go to the counter to get silverware and napkins. No drink refill, no dessert that I ordered at the beginning. I tried the chicken sandwich... Fried chicken on a piece of plain bread. It worked, I didn't want to much food. I was racing room for the peach cobbler I didn't get. And what restaurant runs out of coleslaw at 11.30am. Well, I'll try them again in 20 years."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and had the chicken fried steak (about the size of my head), cabbage, and red beans -  add a drink and it was still well under $20. Food was hot and flavorful and seasoned just right. A little bit  rough setting but more than made up for it with the food and ultimately that's what you're there for right? 

Staff seemed a little overwhelmed and probably could have used one more person. 

Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Whoever's got the Gold makes the rules and Mrs. White makes gold in that kitchen.

While I'm pretty sure that's not the golden rule Mrs. White is talking about, I think this one is more fitting! Her Smothered Chicken Fried Steak, dripping in gravy might as well have been dripping in gold, it tasted awesome! I ordered mine up with Mac N Cheese and Sweet Potatoes, deciding on those over the okra and the collard greens was tough, but worth it.

Unless you're on one of those reverse diet plans eating a minimum number of calories like an Olympic swimmer, you had better check you diets at the door; this ain't no place for calorie countin'. I told mine I was going out for a light jog on my lunch that day; \"You really don't need to come along.\" I told her; I hope she bought it! 

The ambiance here is likened more to a waffle house experience than 5 star dining, with old school fast food type booths and seating. While you're here, read the wall closely enough, and you will find many Cool signatures penned right on to it. Famous musical entertainers, local and nationally accomplished athletes, and other famed diners can all be found to have dined here once upon a time.

Our waitress was surprisingly fit and trim for someone who serves food at a Soul Food spot. I had to ask, \"Just how do you keep that girlish figure while working and dining here?\" which she replied with \"running back and forth with orders all day\" and \"hiking my favorite trails\" on her off days. I have to note that she is now my new inspiration. Maybe I need to get a job here. I wonder how that would go over for my diet plan? Hmmmm.

Happy Yelping Phoenix, it's time to go for gold!"}
{"text":"We decided to checkout Mrs. White's for dinner a few weeks back since we hadn't visited since we first moved to Phoenix...13+ years ago!  The restaurant is nothing to look at, but what comes out of that kitchen is all that matters.  I thoroughly enjoyed the smothered pork chops with mac 'n cheese and green beans with potatoes...probably my week's worth of calories, but worth every bite!  The staff is super friendly and the food is pure comfort - a winner in my book!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent! It reminds me of my grandmother's, aunts', and mother's home cooking. The customer service while we were in the restaurant was pretty good. The reason I cannot give them a five star review is because of something that happened immediately after we left the restaurant. One of the students we were dining with left their to-go container of food in the restaurant on accident. Our server brought it out to us and said, \"Do y'all want this sh**?\" That's not how you should speak to any customer, let alone a group that has children with them. My experience was dramatically soured by this. The other employees even recognized the inappropriateness of the statement because she asked him, \"Why you say it like that?\" Although I really liked the food, I don't think I can return because that sends the message that it's alright to speak to customers in this manner, and it is not."}
{"text":"really want to like this place...and honestly the food is okay, I would give it a 4.5. 
I was really excited to find another soul food resturaunt because they are so hard to find in Arizona and it's down the street from work so that even sweetened the pot. I'm basically going to list the pros and cons of this place.

Pros: 
-Free/ convenient parking
-Quality food 4/5 ( 4 because my fried pork chop was SUPER salty and my neck bones were not seasoned enough)
- Very friendly staff
- small mom and pop restaurant ( not a chain, so the location still has that homey feeling)

Cons:
-SERVICE ( there is something DEFINITELY left to be desired)- I've been here twice and both times my order was made incorrectly... 1) a coworker and I placed an order.. we pick it up to find they placed my fried pork chop with her sides and her smothered pork chop with my sides. Instead of offering to fix it, they told us to just swap everything around ourselves. So messy! 2) I ordered neck bones with cabbage and yams as a side and a separate side of yams for someone else. I pick it up and there are 2 sides of yams in my container...keep in mind one was for someone else. Before fixing it the argued back and fourth a bit and asked me if I clarified over the phone that it was for someone else....I DID, I even asked her if she understood to put it in separate containers and she said yes. Obviously not. 

-somewhat over priced.

All in all I really want to support this place... a homeless man around 19, walked in and said he was down on his luck and wanted to know if they could help him out. The owner (I'm guessing) told him to have a seat, she asked what he wanted to drink, went to the kitchen and returned with a full plate of food for him. It's not often that people express this amount of kindness for someone that can't do anything for them in return. 

So I would give the food a solid 4 and the service a 3...making that a 3.5...but since 1/2's don't exist on yelp I will give it a 4. With better service this place could be amazing!"}
{"text":"We came there on November 5, 2011 and the service was very bad. The worst I have ever seen and we were treated like shit. We came into town from LA and Vegas for the NFL game and seen Mrs. White's cafe on Foodnet Work and knew the food had to be great. The chicken was great, but the customer service was so bad we will never return again.  We got a refill on our drinks and the guy poured sum of our drinks on the left overs so we could not take our food back to the hotel. Foodnet Work shame on you for recommending this place. Just because the chicken is good, does not mean you treat people like shit. 

We had to remind the staff over six times to get our order. We waited over 40 minutes to get the other 3 pieces of chicken to finish our meal. We don't mind waiting but it was pretty rude when you are watching other peolple are getting their meals when they walked in after us. The Mac and Cheese did not look like everyone else's order- it look like it came out of a box. You can tell it was far from homemade, it cleary was not bake, no crust. The gravy was watered, missing favor. Corn bread was over cooked under salted. The cornbread sure as  hell did not look like everyones else's cornbread. I felt like we received the leftovers. 

Truly the worst service we ever received. The place needs to learn how to be respectful and just be nice."}
{"text":"This place has been here forever! Used be open only 5 days a week and cash only. Now open 7 days and take cards. Some of the best home/soul food around Everything is made when ordered so it comes out hot. All the visiting pro athletes come here for homestyle cooking when playing in PHX. Not a big place, so it can get busy at lunch. They're open for dinner now, too, but I have not been here for dinner. I typically get the fried pork chops, greens, and sweet potatoes. The fried chicken is really good too! All the Southern staples are available; red beans, black eyed peas, green beans, sweet potatoes, mixed greens, catfish, pork chops, and chicken. For dessert, peach cobbler. Not fancy but has never disappointed with the food. Family-owned and all very nice people."}
{"text":"AMAZING food AMAZING service. Anyone who gives this place a bad rating is just crazy. Would recommend this place to anyone. Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"The quality vs value of this place has completely plummetted in recent times and I had a very disappointing visit a few weeks ago. I had met a couple of friends for lunch who had never been here before. Told them that it was one of the best soul food places I've ever been to, which at time of stating had been quite true. I've been coming here for about seven or eight years and I remember when the food used to cost $8.80 per plate - AND after your meal someone was always walking around offering the dessert of the day to everyone. Quaint and tasty and decently priced. Now, everything is almost double that, over $14 per plate. And the flavours have gone downhill. I told these guys the cornbread at Mrs White's was all-world. Out comes stale shitty cornbread that I guarantee was made the previous day - we got there at just after 11am so I KNOW it wasn't fresh. One of my friends asked for mac and cheese, they didn't have it. Also didn't have red beans and rice, which is what I normally order. Um, ok. I asked for smothered chicken. The other two asked for fried chicken. Out come three plates of fried chicken. I was too hungry to care. Then the guy comes out and says they DO have mac and cheese. Whatever. Collard greens aren't flavourful at all - almost like something steamed out of a Green Giant freezer pack. Fried chicken was okay, but not anything better than Church's and three times the price. And nobody offered any dessert, not that we would have had it anyway.

The bill for all three of us came to $48!! For basically something I could have cobbled together myself and I'm not even kidding. Kraft mac and cheese would have been tastier. Fried chicken takes a little while but isn't rocket science. Collard greens are a twenty-five cent side, and I almost broke my tooth on the cornbread. This place went from a treat to a disaster in one horrible visit. Won't be back unless and until they literally halve their prices and go back to the quality hole-in-the-wall they used to be. At least they accept credit cards now - only took them a half century to figure that out. And to top it off, their website is just as jacked up as their prices. 2 stars."}
{"text":"When you first walk into this place, it might scare you away. But don't leave! There are about 4 things on the menu but they're 4 little pieces of heaven! This will be some of the best souls food you've ever eatin! Get ready for some unreal food!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but I just cannot get past how horrible the service was. It took us almost 2 hours to order and eat our food, what were they doing? The restaurant was not full, it was not busy. Probably will not be going back."}
{"text":"I came in with my friend who hyped it up. I had high hopes for the Mac n cheese and ordered the cobbler first. Which had what looked like a hair. Which was apparently from a brush the waiter put it in his mouth to prove it wasn't a hair  they brought the food it was way too salty and the macaroni in the mac and cheese was over cooked. They used cheese sauce and not cheddar cheese to my disappointment it resembled KFC Mac and cheese. I ordered a sandwich which ended up being just a piece of country fried chicken in sauce no bread. I asked the  waitresses if I could get the bread and she asked if I wanted bread or corn bread I enthusiastically said corn bread which didn't come ever until my friend went and asked for it. Which all together took about 30 minutes. All together the service was horrible the food not very good. I tasted the greens which were tasty.

Ultimately I was disappointed on top of that I got over changed. But I decided to just call it a night. 

They didn't seem to care too much about anything. 

I most likely won't go back again. And it sucks. I really wanted to like this place but it just didn't happen."}
{"text":"Mrs. Whites makes genuinely good food that you can't pass up!  If you live in Phoenix and have never tried it, you're doing yourself a disservice.

These guys are best known for their fried chicken, and for good reason!  It is always fresh and super crisp on the outside but nice and juicy on the inside.  It is cooked to absolute perfection.  It is handily some of the better fried chicken I have ever had.  I wish the batter they used for the coating had a bit more seasoning or spices since I like my chicken with a bit of a kick, but they have plenty of Louisiana Hot Sauce to dump all over it if that's your thing (it's often mine).

Chicken isn't all they do, however, and if you're just not in the mood for fried chicken, they have plenty of other southern staples to satisfy your appetite, including fish and pork chops.  They also have solid homestyle sides and very yummy cornbread.  On the weekends they make a knockout okra gumbo that is to die for.

The place itself is a dump, but that is actually a good thing in this case (at least to me).  It has tons of character and charm and it really feels like it has a history!

One tip: don't bother unless you're hungry.  The portions are huge.  REALLY HUGE.  I've never left here without a distended stomach...  It's not the cheapest place to eat in the valley (plan on nearly $20 for a lunch with tip), but the food is generally worth it, and if you're hungry enough to eat it all, it's a decent value."}
{"text":"Served Southern style meat + 2 sides. Very good fried chicken and I like the veggies better than those at LoLo's. Very nice wait staff but haphazard service. No rhyme or reason to order taking, bread delivery. Some served cornbread immediately upon arrival, but I had to ask for some 10 minutes after food delivered. Waited 20 minutes before tea arrived and 30 before food arrived. Still, I would come back. Interesting that you walk up to cash register in front and tell the guy what you got. Really old school. But that's another reason I like it here. Just be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was great!  They have the best collard greens I've had since I've lived in Az and the macaroni and cheese was creamy and so good.  
The service was great and the staff was super friendly.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the service as well as the food today. I have been a couple of times before and I have never had a complaint about the place. But today the service was pitiful. I am hoping that it was just an off day and not the way things are going to be in the future. I will give it one more chance just cause I have had such good food in the past."}
{"text":"It was good but not great.  Went there for an early lunch at 1130am.  The chicken was great.  Lots of big pieces.  However it tool almost 45 minutes to get served and I thought it was a bit expensive.  The 3 peice meal and a drink came to over $17 plus tip."}
{"text":"I wanted to hit up LoLos one day but somehow I ended up here. 

There is something about this food that makes you want to roll yourself out of the building and take a nap for about 3 days.  I mean, smothered pork chops! Who does it better? The cornbread....oh the cornbread.... *smile*
The portion sizes are generous without being overboard. You'll most likely finish your plate if you bring an appetite. 

The ambiance is perfect for what's being served and the people running the joint are super friendly.
If I ate here every day I'd for sure need a bypass within a year....that means yummy."}
{"text":"I will never drive an hour to go to a restaurant, how many people would?  Muchless driving two hours.  However, for Ms. Whites I would - and do - drive 2 hours for a meal!  This is one of the last remaining institutions in town and I am honored to attend.  Amazing real food."}
{"text":"Good fried chicken, not the best though.

DDD, you've disappoint me.  I went to this restaurant because it was featured on the Food Network channel.  I should have left when I walked in and saw the \"dining room.\"  And when I say \"dining room,\" I mean a dirty, take-out, greasy space with small tables that looked like they were thrown away by the public schools cafeteria.

But hey, at least I can say that I gave it a shot."}
{"text":"OH YEAH...I chose to eat here because I read about it in some magazine and it sounded unique.  My husband and I took our real estate broker with us, a guy a little younger than us who loves to eat as much as we do. I ate the catfish, black eyed peas, collard greens and yams...I ate it ALL! We all shared the peach cobbler. I think I scared our RE Broker who was with us...he said he had never seen a regular sized woman eat so much at one seating...yeah, I can eat! 

I don't remember what my husband or our friend had but we were all happy and it was all amazingly good...I love soul food and this was the best I think I've ever had."}
{"text":"AmaIn food fast service great environment amazing woman killing it service wonderful I will be backing"}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place so decided to to it for myself. 2 words - never again. First of all, there was a sign that said \"Parking $1 plus $9 Tip.\"  I don't know if it was a joke or serious but I was NOT parking there. I parked on the street. When I go inside, the place is empty. (I'm not going to go into detail about the horrible decor)  The hostess gave me a menu since I wanted it To Go, but also gave me a book of oils... Hustling OILS as I looked over the overpriced menu. Wow. Ghet-to.  The meals were $13 for an entree and 2 sides. I got the smothered chicken with gravy on the side, black eyed peas and rice, and macaroni and cheese. After waiting about 30 minutes for my $15 meal, I left. (They forgot my gravy. I went back for it)

The Meal: Chicken was incredibly fatty. Lots of parts I could not eat. The black eyed peas and rice were flavorless. No seasoning. No salt. The macaroni and cheese was clearly BOXED! Cheap, sad excuse for a soul food restaurant to have boxed soupy Mac and cheese. The meal came with cornbread which was hard and heavy and absolutely inedible. Overall, I was very disappointed with my meal and the service I received from Mrs White's. I'm not fond of LoLos either but I would GLADLY eat there before spending another dime at Mrs White's. The search for good soul food in Phoenix continues..."}
{"text":"Simply delicious!!  So good, I have to stay away or I would be on the Biggest Loser, lol."}
{"text":"Disappointed at the service. After going to LoLos for years, finally brought my family to Mrs Whites.  One server working on a busy Sunday (post church), and waited (along with the rest of the restaurant patrons) for almost two hours! Food quality was less than par (going to LoLos from now on.)"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried at this place has ranged from excellent to phenomenal.  It's a very simple place with a limited menu of fried chicken, pork chops, catfish and other basic Southern food.  The catfish dinner is one huge(!) slab of fish with a really tasty batter.  The okra gumbo, available only on weekends, is excellent (try a couple dashes of hot sauce to liven it up).  On top of that the prices are cheap.  Service is friendly, and while sometimes they get really packed and it's a bit slower, it's never bad."}
{"text":"Having heard so much about Mrs. Whites, had to try it.

Known for its Fried Chicken, on my first trip I asked the Counter Waitress (very helpful by the way) what she suggested and she said \"The Pork Chop.\" Well I came for the Fried Chicken so she suggested a \"Combination Plate\" with both. Glad she did!

The Pork Chop, thin and apparently pan fried was absolutely TERRIFIC! If I could have, I would have eaten the bone! Obviously a combination of coating and temperature, which is able to partially caramelize the small amount of fat on the Pork Chop, make it delectable. The Fried Chicken was a bit of a disappointment on both occasions. NOT the best I have had and honestly, I could almost do as well at home. Additionally, the breast piece (on both occasions) was anemic without much meat and skin. Sides? Mac and Cheese and the Cabbage are addictive. The best? CORNBREAD! Wonderful, hot, full of flavor and no butter is needed.

NOT a bargain at $13 without a drink for lunch (they are only open until 7 PM) but lots of choices besides the Pork Chop and Fried Chicken."}
{"text":"Convenient spot diagonal from the stadium. Great place for smothered pork chops... Greens and sweet potatoes like gma made... Check out the autographs on the wall."}
{"text":"I am Southern, born and raised. This was the best fried chicken I have ever eaten outside of my mom's kitchen.  The vegetables were delicious   We were too full to try any of the desserts.  Amazing that the best Southern food I've eaten in a restaurant was in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Yes they are family but Mrs White's is BETTER than LoLos!!! Bigger portions and less $$ not to mention less wait time and better parking. $13 gets you a 3 piece meal with two large sides and cornbread. Mac n cheese and greens are THE best sides. Drink water instead of Koolaid or Tea and save the sugar for dessert with her famous Peach Cobbler with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Oh my I am salivating ;)"}
{"text":"Chicken could have been a little less salty  but the service is HORRIBLE!!! They are so ghetto and rude waitress never came back to the table food took 1hr to come out no one ever said sorry for your wait. It's just beyond HORRIBLE! I would never eat there again! Just another ghetto black owned restaurant."}
{"text":"I was trying for 3.5 stars, not quite 4, def not 5...
Was visiting from out of town and stumbled on this place on one of Phoenix to-do list website. The service was quick, young lady taking our order was very friendly and made us feel welcome, our food arrived hot and fresh, I had pork chop platter potato salad and Mac n cheese, chops were delicious, seasoned and fried well, my daughter had country fried steak which was fabulous. Wasn't the best soul food I've ever had but it passes..."}
{"text":"Food took forever. Came out bland, and tasteless. Mac and cheese was mush. Yams were mush. Ordered smothered pork chops, received one pork, one beef. I didn't get sick from any cross contamination, but I didn't eat the beef chop. They were two completely different colors, but they insisted it was pork.$16 and all I ate was a pork chop, two bites of each side. None of the burnt cornbread.. and two glasses of koolaid."}
{"text":"Lots of famous people have eaten here and there's thank you notes written all over the white patched walls to prove it, along with hand written menus on the walls.  

I came here after watching The Best I Ever Ate on the food network.  So maybe my expectations were too high because I don't think it was the best fried chicken I've ever had.  Don't get me wrong, it was good but I hate to admit that I've had better.  I would say this fried chicken ranks in my top 5 for fried chicken.

The staff is friendly and the lemonade is good.  Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I just ate here. OMG! The food was delicious. I had the juicy chicken fried steak, Mac and cheese,cabbage and a piece of corn bread. I almost finished everything. I would recommend this place to everyone. The service was really friendly too. Thank you for a wonderful meal. I will be back.."}
{"text":"Looks like I'm still in search for the best chicken in town. Since I have moved here, I have been searching for food that can replace my favorites from Long Beach area. 
I came here after reading all the great reviews, and hearing about it in the news and tv shows. All I can say is their chicken is good. Nothing I haven't had before. Very crispy, skin had a lot of flavoring. The chicken did not. I also had rice and gravy, potato salad, corn bread, and lemonade. Their potato salad was great, reminded me of our family bbq in the LBC. Rice and gravy was ok, not much flavor. Especially when you are eating chicken the gravy becomes a beverage. Corn bread was really good also. 
The pros:
Lemonade
Service
Potato salad
Cornbread

Cons:
Prices
Size of the chicken
Rice

Again, this is not a bad place. Probably come back again. However, I am still looking for that great fried chicken!"}
{"text":"I always make a point of visiting a Fried Chicken place every time I am in a new US City and Mrs White's was up there with the best! I ordered the Golden Fried chicken which came with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 sides and smashed it down. Bit too expensive for me to give 5 stars (it came to nearly $14) but still a good place to go for a treat."}
{"text":"Warning, this place is NOT good for your diet. But for your soul, it's perfect. Great homemade cooking that is flavorful and filling. The fried chicken is the best I've ever had. Seriously. The sides are wonderful, the drinks are what you'd expect to have if sitting on a wraparound porch in the antebellum south. 

The service is slow, but go expecting that, and go with cash, because they are old school and don't accept plastic. It may take awhile, but they're cooking this from scratch, so enjoy looking at all of the famous autographs scrawled on the walls, joke around with your host, and be ready for a week's worth of calories in one sitting. You'll surely be glad you did, shug."}
{"text":"I went to the establishment as a expert of soul food.  If Mrs White's was anywhere in the south, it would not have gotten any accolades.  Don't get me wrong.  The fried chicken was good, with a perfect texture and crunchy outside.  And if I was only grading it on the chicken, she would have been \"movin on up\" status but the mac and cheese was a poor excuse.  Bland and as close to store bought without purchasing from KFC as you can get.  The red beans and rice were worse.  But what was I expecting in Phoenix as far as soul food goes?  I have seen 3 african americans since arriving to PHX and 2 worked at Mrs Whites.  I suggest sticking to the tex-mex..."}
{"text":"I tried this place tonight after hearing how great the food is. I had fried catfish (awesome, awesome), fresh fried okra ( yes, it was fresh not frozen) black eyed peas (kinda blah), mixed greens (flavor wasn't great), corn bread and sweet tea. The tea tasted like my mom's. This is kind of a country hick place. Nothing fancy, far from it. Dingy and dirty; hasn't been cleaned in haw many years? There are a lot of autographs from famous people and athletes on the walls. The server (a nice young lady) was also the cook. If you are looking for ambiance this is not the place to go. If you are looking for good food, go to Mrs. Whites. There are no prices listed and I was a bit surprised at our bill. 2 dinners and 1 glass of tea and 1 glass of koolade (? spelling) $34.00 No breakdown of charges. All dinners are $15.00"}
{"text":"I wish I would have read the reviews prior to taking my party of five, especially since this was highly suggested from a friend that used to live in Phoenix.  

Similarly to the other reviews, service was unspeakable slow, tall-giant woman was extremely rude (of course she finished her meal at the bar prior to taking ours), literally got our meals one at a time over a 30 minute span, mac and cheese for three of the four meals came well after all the meals arrived, etc., etc., etc.  

If I didn't feel really bad for the owner just losing his daughter to a long battled illness, I would speak to their unacceptable standards even more.  Don't waste your time; their heart is not into making sure your experience is a pleasurable one.  I don't care how good the food is."}
{"text":"Clutch af.  A rickety little yellow building nestled in a downtown ghetto comprise what I assume most pass by without notice or the eventual intent to enter.  
Please believe: YOU SHOULD.
Mrs White's is by far THE quintessential soul food provider of the entire valley.  I highly recommend you surrender all paper money to this women if your in the area.  If you are in the area I also recommend the wet pork chops with mixed greens and sweet potatoes. 
Happy Dinning."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars, minus .5 for atmosphere.

This is a low key spot (albeit crowded at times) with not much in the way of decor...  But the staff is friendly, and food is delicious!.  Rarely do I compliment others on their fried chicken (momma gets the top spot in my book) -- but I must admit, this place give my mother and grandma a run for their money.  And to top it off, the sweet potatoes are simply divine.

After you throw in some good old fashion sweet tea and moderate pricing, you know you've got a winner.
 
If you are looking for a trendy spot to dress up and people watch, this is not the place.  But if you are desperately in need of some down home southern treats, visit Mrs. White's."}
{"text":"Very friendly and fast service.  We were greeted with a smile and good ole southern hospitality.  From reading some of the negative reviews, it seems like those reviewers aren't too familiar with soul food. In a soul food restaurant \"sandwich\" is open faced with no garnish.  Condiments available by requests.  And chicken will always be served with bones.  LOL. The fried pork chop sandwich and 1 side is just enough for a mid day lunch."}
{"text":"Southern Comfort Food

I have wanted to try Mrs White's for some time, so today I put Mrs. White's on our agenda for lunch. We arrived about noon. We were greeted, seated immediately, and given the one page menu. 

I  had already planned on ordering the chicken after reading all the yelp reviews however, I  was  unsure what sides to have. Mrs White's offers so many southern style sides, black-eyed peas, cabbage, collard greens, mac & cheese, rice and gravy, potato salad, and so much more.

 On this visit I order the 3 piece chicken, potato salad, and rice and gravy. Our waitress reminded us that the chicken is made to order so may be a short wait.  As we waited we were treated  with cornbread and honey.  The cornbread was warm and made with real course cornmeal not processed cornmeal, it was very good. 

Our chicken arrived in a short time and was served piping-hot.
The chicken portion are big, three large pieces. The skin on the chicken was very crispy and had a lot of flavor. However, the chicken was just average, maybe I was expecting more and the gravy and rice lacked flavor, but the potato salad was delicious.

While dining, we noticed  that the tables were filled pretty regularly and the seats at the counter were filled the entire time. I like that the walls at Mrs White's were covered with white boards and felt pens were  available to leave messages on the boards. Parking is tight at Mrs White's but it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"The soul food at Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe is so delicious. Super friendly people work here and they have kool-aid! Good spot, I recommend! No wonder it's been around for more than 50 years! I had the fried chicken, mac n cheese, and greens! So tasty!"}
{"text":"I've attempted to visit this restaurant twice with them being on vacation both times. I can understand the first attempt because I didn't call ahead but not the second. I called 8/31/2017 at 3pm to insure they were open and answered woman assured me that they would be open 9/1/2017 from 10:30am-7pm. I tried to go 9/1/2017 around 11:30am and to my surprise they were on vacation again... I give up...
9/29/2017 I called ahead and they were actually open. The Juicy Chicken Friend Steak was amazing and made me change my mind. The service still sucked but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"Service and location not desirable what so ever. Food pretty darn good. Had pork chops Mac n cheese and green beans with taters.....man was it good. Mac n cheese I've def had better but it wasn't bad. Corn bread was not great at all...terrible. Can't believe they serve it...may be it was a bad batch? My friend had fried chicken greens and Mac n cheese. Fried chicken right on! But greens were awful. No flavor what so ever. Out of a can possibly? Waitress was odd and seemed to care about herself and the locals at the counter more than us, even tho we arrived well before them. Took a while for the food considering the joint was pretty empty. Worth the wait tho. I shall return!!!"}
{"text":"The reviews were spot on. Great Fried Chicken. Nice friendly staff. The Sweet Potatoes were awesome as were the Black-eyed peas. I will be back"}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic soul food.  This restaurant is an old Phoenix institution and a hallmark of our city's relatively small African-American community. If you can't guess it already, you'll figure out why it's called the \"Golden Rule\" cafe when it comes time to pay the bill. My cholesterol level can't afford frequent trips to this place otherwise I'd be here far more often. The gravy is yummy."}
{"text":"My impressions are lasting ones is all I can say.  I ventured off to try Mrs. Whites yesterday and was very disappointed.  The service was horrible, out of half the menu at 5pm, and just unprofessional.  

The only bright spot was my fried chicken and black eye peas which was delicious.  

That being said someone needs to take the lead and get restaurant back on track."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for lunch after doing The Urban Slide (large slip n' slide) event a block away. It was Sunday and about 1:20 and still had quite the crowd. I decided to order the Fried Chicken with Cabbage and Mac n' Cheese and my boyfriend ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich w/applesauce. Well, we got our food and I had PLENTY of chicken (3 pieces) and good amount of sides. Well, my boyfriends chicken sandwich was two pieces of wheat bread with two pieces of fried chicken (leg and wing - with bones) on top of the bread. It really wasn't a chicken sandwich which was kind of disappointing. I gave him my chicken breast and took his leg. We both had ran out of water and asked for more but the server only brought us one glass so we shared that. While the chicken was very good and so were the sides I would be back but maybe not have the chicken sandwich (since it really wasn't a sandwich)."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is awesome and the portion sizes are huge. The only thing I didn't like was the peach cobbler. It was like eating peach soup because it was watered down."}
{"text":"This place has potential. A restaurant doesn't need to be beautiful or spotless to be great. You can do without friendly service. All you really need is good food. 

Myself, Dining Partner, and two others came around 12:30 on a Friday afternoon. We were maybe 1 group of 4 in the place. We got the 3 piece fried chicken with mac and cheese and collard greens as our sides. It took awhile but once it arrived, the food was good. We ended up getting a free piece of drenched chicken because the waiter couldn't remember who it went to. The drenched chicken was better than the fried chicken. They ran out of ice, so we had room temperature water and our cornbread came out after we had already finished our chicken. Maybe the waiter was new; he was definitely overwhelmed. I probably wouldn't return to eat-in but I think takeout would be the way to go."}
{"text":"R U N!!!!!!       R U N !!!!!!      I repeat run!!    Atrocious and utterly  Disgusting customer service......even for simple  to-go orders!! I stopped by to place an order for lunch.  A polite young lady greeted me at the door and once she went behind the counter to take my order,  a large unkempt wholly mammoth looking creature with a grey beard came up also and demanded that I take a seat and the young woman tried to explain to him I was getting a to-go order.  Ignoring her comments......The guy begin to filibuster about how they have to cook the food. (And I guess hunt for it).  It was very bizarre and I didn't feel safe ordering anything from here,  (given the owner would  let  someone with prison inmate like customer  service skills manage the front counter....heck maybe that was the owner, that's usually how it is).   Also, no reason to go somewhere where you feel as though you're in apprehension of receiving a battery.   This was my first visit here and  I sensed the business owners play off the fact that AZ doesn't have many soul food eateries,  so they feel  they can treat customers anyway they want and they will keep coming back.   Not I.  Being from the south, im use to soul food restaurant staff having  a lil rudeness or curt like customer service skills.....but this situation was more like a scene from the tv show \"OZ\". If you don't mind being spoken to like you're on cell block d, in a restaurant that is seemingly unsanitary,  with numerous safety code violations on the outside...eat here.  #buthideyourspoons 

#lowdowndirtyshame"}
{"text":"I just came here on a Sunday after talking this place up  only to be disappointed. We not only sat for 30 plus waiting for our food but they decided to tell us after placing order they didn't have chicken!!! So when did you figure that out? They offered some peach cobbler as a peace offering but we declined. I don't see myself EVER going  now."}
{"text":"Just a simple little place with a wonderful dynamic that is hard to find. Their food is made just as Mrs White wanted it and you can taste the love that the food is made with. I had the fried chicken and it comes with two side but you can't just stop at two. I had the cabbage, macaroni and cheese, Cole slaw, black eyed peas, greens, and sweet potatoes. So much flavor packed into each little bite.

I have to say if you are bougie and need a classy place, please go elsewhere. You do not come here for the service, Make sure you get it to go if that's the case. This is what Mrs White wanted and it's the way the place will stay. 

It's about the food not the ambiance:"}
{"text":"First time eating soul food... my fabulous boss brought me here for a lunch meeting. Needless to say, the \"meeting\" went out the window and we just chowed down for a good hour. Red beans over rice, mac n cheese, cornbread, catfish... I felt like I was in the movie, Soul Food (can I be Nia Long for a day?) 

Five stars based on food only. Service wasn't great... girl at the counter had an attitude problem, or maybe just had a bad day - but no excuses for trying to mess up my experience! Go here anyway!"}
{"text":"All I can say is \"What the hell\"? I'm so embarrassed by some of the reviews that point out this is the best soul food they ever tasted.   They only could justify that untruth if they did not grow to in a family that cooked with love or never been to  a Kentucky Fried Chicken.  The food and service was horrible.  My guest and I had to ask for silverware, cornbread and refilled....again \"what the hell\".   I was raised on soul food and know the difference between store bought and homemade.  Oh sure they doctor it up but totally got the prescription wrong.  The food has absolutely no flavor, lacks salt, lowreys seasoning, black pepper, garlic powder, mind you these are staples in cooking soul food especially Fried Chicken.  I'm African American so this next statement is not intended to be racist but come on black people, how can you tout yourself as the best Fried Chicken and truly taste horrible.  Again, \"what the hell\".   It's very easy to make gravy....especially if you have the drippings from your fried chicken so why did this gravy taste like it came from a can.  What surprised me most was to see the tourist eat their food like it was the best food they ever tasted.  Poor visitors, this is not soul food.  Save your 17.00 per plate and drink  and go have Kentucky or better yet Jack in the box.  Yes almost $34 for two plates of chicken and two drinks.  Honestly people \"what the hell\"?"}
{"text":"It is true that service can be slow and some orders get mixed up, especially during the lunch hour rush BUT THE FOOD IS REALLY GOOD!  Well worth the wait. If you're in the mood for some good fried chicken or fried catfish this is the place to go. The place is a bit old so don't expect a shiny new place but it definitely has character!"}
{"text":"Food is bomb!  The atmosphere isn't the best; but the food definitely makes up for it. I will definitely go again. I've gone just to get the peach cobbler."}
{"text":"So let's see I had heard great things about the Fried Chicken here....well it was true.

Sides (Mac n cheese & Coleslaw).....very good.....homemade even.

Lemonade Kool-Aid.....hmmmmm.....a little to sweet for my taste but wasn't bad

Free Refills.....very nice......ummmmmm.

Service.....good....staff very friendly.....but don't really earn there tips.

Location right across the street from Chase Field....perfectly awesome for me.

Parking Lot a bit small....but there is street parking....however be careful of that.

The building itself is very small.....like a shack almost....but not terrible.

Public Transportation nearby....that is a plus for those who live downtown.

Pricing could be better.....3 pieces of chicken....2 sides.....and Cornbread....13 bucks.

They do take debit but there is 1.00 charge I think to use it.....that is pretty terrible....but since everything was pretty good we didn't complain. We also had a groupon deal 10 bucks we paid for 20 bucks worth of food....but with the pricing of the food we barely broke even....so don't know if it is worth it. All in all in was a pleasant experience....but unless you live downtown or are attending a game driving here just for soul food....might not be your best option. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"I truly loved this place.  The people are so friendly and it reminded me of being in New Orleans in terms of the food and the attitude of the place.  It's not the cleanest restaurant but it has charm and authenticity.  I had the fried chicken which was delicious.  My friend had the chicken fried steak which was also great.  There are no soft drinks other than lemonade and sweet southern tea.  If you like southern comfort food in a very casual and friendly atmosphere then this is your place."}
{"text":"Whenever I feel the urge for a gravy fix, I head straight over to Mrs. White's. I almost always order the pork chops - smothered. OMG gravy goodness running all over the plate! As for the sides, just pick one - they are ALL good! 

There isn't much that I can add to the other reviews, except that I have actually called Mrs. White's before holiday potlucks and had them whip up some extra cornbread for me to take. They always seem a little tickled at the request, but have never refused and it allows me to focus on the festivities (not to mention everyone expects it now).

If you are looking for really good food in a unique and relaxed setting Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe should not be missed."}
{"text":"Came here based on Foodnetwork's  TV show: The Best Thing I Ever Ate. The fried chicken was ok, skin was nicely crisped, but the seasoning was not marinated through the meat itself. So, it was rather bland. I really liked the side dishes, though."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're worried about cholesterol levels.  This place is delicious and unpretentious.  Bring cash and an appetite.  You can't really get better fried chicken or waffles in town."}
{"text":"This place sucks ass! For one the staff is rude! Completely rude! They act as though it's an inconvenience to be serving you. As if since their food is good they can treat you any kind of way. Hospitality will not be found. Second their food is not all its made out to be. Sorry I'll never give this place my money again. I've found me a awesome spot somewhere else in the east valley."}
{"text":"This is not only the best Soul food that I've ever had, it's the Best fried chicken, macaroni and cheese and cabbage I've ever had in a restaurant!  The chicken was cooked to perfection, crispy, moist and flavorful. The cabbage was so good that my sister ordered a double of it. The Mac and cheese was just as delicious the last bite as the first. Each cheesy mouthful gave a burst of sharp, yet smooth heaven.  I can't describe it any better.  It's just that good!    
     It's a 'hole-in-the-wall, but don't let that deter you.  Like so many others it's worth checking out.  Your taste buds and purse will thank you !"}
{"text":"Real southern style soul food that is reasonably priced. The kool aid is sweet, and the staff have the right attitude."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is simply incredible, possibly outdone only by the smothered pork chops which were among the most delicious thing I've ever eaten! The chicken fried steak was also good but nowhere near the rest. Sides are fresh and just about everything is a good choice but the sweet potatoes were addictively awesome. 

Servers were very attentive and friendly. I did get a weird feeling when paying after getting absolutely no response to signing the credit card slip and leaving a 20% tip. The gentleman who seemed initially full of smiles very obviously examined the tip line then set down the slip and gave us no further acknowledgement as we turned away and left. It just felt weird and was an unfortunate closing experience."}
{"text":"When I first discovered this Cafe, I thought it was a typical Diner Cafe. You know, breakfast and brunch type foods. When me and my son arrived we discovered it was far from that. But it was a pleasant surprise. Their food is downright delicious! I had their catfish the first time I was there and I was in heaven besides that I got were greens, cabbage, and sweet potatoes , yes I got three sides. The second time I was there I wanted to order catfish but they were out. That is the reason for the four stars. I feel like a restaurant should be eat fully stocked at least till a couple hours before closing time. But I got the fried chicken instead. And it was just as delicious. If you're in the mood for soul food and good soul food you will have to check out this Café."}
{"text":"This place was a staple in the community. Food use to be on point and delicious. Now the service takes 20 minutes cause a lady is talking and taking her time. We waited for our food for over 30 minutes and it was over fried. Come to find out they only have 1 deep fryer and use that for everyone's order. Empty tables with dirty dishes on it. Won't be back until they can turn this hot mess around."}
{"text":"Overall, this place is pretty good.  The price is a bit high, but I enjoyed the fried chicken and chicken fried steak that I had here.  On the down side, the black eyed peas tasted like the canned variety and I felt the cornbread was a tad too dry.  I would also avoid this place on a busy day - fresh fried food takes awhile.

I think Lolo's and Golden Rule are run by the same family (or are related somehow) and the two are quite similar. In my opinion Lolo is a full star better though, and if you are reading Yelp to decide between the two then I would recommend passing on Golden Rule."}
{"text":"we love going there. food is super..fried chicken great and all sides perfect.
nice staff. we met the REAL Mrs. White and she is so cute and very nice.
we go as often as possible.  real soul food baby..nothing like it"}
{"text":"This was one of the better soul food places I've visited since I moved here. The food was excellent! I ordered the catfish, rice with gravy and cabbage. My girlfriend ordered the chicken-fried steak, rice and mac and cheese.  Both dishes were tasty, and the only reasons I give this place 4 stars are because of the lemonade and the hired help. With all of the homemade dishes, you'd think the lemonade would be as well. Instead, it tasted like that Tampico mess that Fry's carries. As far as the staff...they were friendly to customers, but horribly unprofessional toward each other.--at least the two younger staff. Although I'm all about feeling like I'm \"at home\", I'd rather not hear people bicker back and forth in the kitchen, shouting all the foul language you'd hear at a playground. (wish I could attach soundbytes)--In all, I was impressed and neither of those two complaints could keep me from going back. :)"}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough. Don't let the looks fool you, the food is delicious! This is my Favorite soul food restaurant in Arizona. I live in Tucson but I always stop here whenever I'm in Phoenix. It's my understanding that LoLos chicken and waffels is owned my the son of Mrs. Whites. I discovered Lolos first, then heard about this place and I make sure to stop here whenever I'm in town! Cornbread comes with every meal. And the sweet tea and Koolaid is SWEET lol. The staff are always nice. I love the fried chicken and yams."}
{"text":"The 2 piece chicken entree consisted of a back and a wing.  I'd have been okay with that if the price hadn't been $13!  Service was slow, at 1:20 pm the ice tea and cole slaw \"hadn't been made yet.\"  The fried okra arrived after we were done eating."}
{"text":"I had the chicken fried steak. It was bad. Thick. Not pounded out. Leathery. The coating fell off. They gave me sweet tea twice. I asked for unsweetened. Not sure if they were playing with me or simple. Even if graded on a curve, that dish wasn't good food or even soul food. Folks around Phoenix must not know better if this place has such a good and long reputation."}
{"text":"Okay, this is not the friendly confines of Lolo's Chicken and Waffles and does not appear interested in trying to be.  We visited this somewhat historic spot after a play at the nearby Black Theater Troupe's Black Nativity production, which was great by the way. 

Okay, the confines are rustic in the sense that it has absolutely no frills about it.  You get the feeling that not much has changed whenever it opened, whether it was in the 60s, 70s or 80s.  Where its progeny, Lolo's (grandson of Mrs. White) has developed a Phoenix soul food favorite replete with friendly confines in phoenix as well as Scottsdale Mrs. White has kept it very simple for only those very comfortable with a non dressed up locale. 

Finally, the food.  I was skeptical initially.  The décor made me assess and reassess whether I wanted to give it a shot.  The menu, very limited.  They do a couple of things and they do them very well.  Fried chicken, smothered fried chicken, pork chops, catfish, corn bread.  We had a fried chicken dinner, a smothered chicken dinner and two veggie dinners.  

All were excellent.  The veggies were cooked in a clear southern tradition to the greens and black eyed peas.  

If I'm down town and have a yearning for fried chicken or great collard greens (better than Lolo's by far) this is the place to trek to.  Take it from a native North Carolinean.  Worth the visit."}
{"text":"Took my girl here when she was in town and the food was great. The cook kept coming out to make sure we were ok. Not sure what the waitress was doing because she disappeared for a little bit but overall I would definitely recommend this place. Not too many soul food places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I'm giving Mrs. Whites one star because of the nice waiter that we had. I'm from Mississippi and this definitely wasn't soul food. Soul food speaks to your soul at first bite. This food was under seasoned to say the least. Black eyed peas when prepared correctly have a gravy to them, these had water. Yams have a caramelization of goodness and brown sugar, etc that cause your yams to separate  and these were whole sweet potatoes in water. Now to the Mac and Cheese... My grandmother would be mad. The highlight was the fried chicken which was okay to say the least.  Maybe soul food in Arizona taste differently from Mississippi. If you want  authentic soul food go check out J's Chicken and Waffles in Tucson. The best yams, fried chicken, greens, etc I've tasted since living Mississippi. His chicken is the best I've tasted in my life."}
{"text":"The wings were seasoned well but they were jumbo, I like my wings smaller. The rest of the food was nasty. The mac and cheese taste like KFC mac and cheese and the cornbread was dry and hard. I came here because it was on the Food Network. It was far from what I expected. Do not believe the hype."}
{"text":"Great soul food. Pork shops smothered in gravy were awesome. Fried okra, Mac and cheese, and cornbread were fantastic as well."}
{"text":"I gave it a one star for the food only because the service is horrible I repeat horrible the lady that works there should be fired we waited two hours like idiots because we were so hungry and we came from California to eat we have eaten there many times throughout the years and it was never this bad they need to hire a new help this goes to Larry the owner you should care for your business so you should hire people that are on top of things I don't think your mother would be happy with that kind of service they forget to give all customers that I seen forks and knives to eat with everybody complained about how are they going to eat without silverware the food is good but that's because of the owners but the help neeto go Doris"}
{"text":"Food coma?  Ohhh  yes!  My sister and I went here for lunch today.  I thought she would be afraid of the Sharpie menu on the wall and low key tables/booths, but she was up for an adventure in delicious southern cooking.  The walls are covered by autographs of athletes, musicians, and others.
The menu consists of Fried Chicken, Chicken Fried Steak, Catfish, Pork Chops, Meatloaf, Neck Bones, and Ox tails.  Sides include black eyed peas, cabbage, green beans and potatoes, yams (they were out by 12:30 today!), collard greens and rice smothered in gravy.  You usually have to ask for cornbread.  The sweet tea is just like mom used to make when we were kids.  You basically get a meat and two sides.  We have never had room for dessert, so I have no idea what is offered.
My sister had the Chicken Fried Steak which was humongous and the perfect saltiness.  She had rice and cabbage.  The cabbage was spiced up with hot pepper.  I had the catfish which was a generous portion perfectly breaded and fried.  The green beans and potatoes were peppery and yummy.  The cornbread is spread with butter and very dense and delicious.  

They only accept cash, so come prepared about $13 bucks a person.  They won't give you a check, so when you are done, just walk up to the counter and pay.

There is a small parking lot in the back of the restaurant.  They have always been friendly to us when we visit, and we will always go back for delicious southern food!"}
{"text":"I drool at the thought of their chicken fried steak, cabbage, and sweet potatoes. I've been eating at Mrs. White's for 16 years, I only wish I lived closer. 
Mac & cheese, fried chicken, greens, the cornbread is the best I've ever had, oh I'm hungry now. I think it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"I went in before closing to order lunch for work the next day. Black eyed peas, Mac n cheese, fried chicken! Let me tell you who ever made the cornbread is a BOSS it gave me strength after a long morning! And to the cashier Big Uncle  $14.50 in my mike Epps voice  salute much respect"}
{"text":"We didn't eat here, but used the parking lot; $10 for Friday and $15 for Saturday. Sunday would've been $20 but we didn't go then. Just a few blocks from the 'Con...worth it!"}
{"text":"I have been visiting Mrs. White's going on 30 years, but after looking up the phone number this afternoon to verify if they were open and still had fried chicken, my wife started reading some of the reviews following a recent Food Network recommendation - I almost got cold feet.

Good thing I didn't. The food is as awesome as ever. The service is much as it has always been. Be forewarned, trendy restaurant goers, who glom onto TV reviews, Mrs. White's is not trendy; there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you. The service is matter of fact, no goofing around, you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing - this is the way it has always been at Mrs. White's. If you are looking for others to pamper you, this is not the place for that. Mrs. White's is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food. If you want Scottsdale ambiance, again, this joint won't work for you.

When you go, be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit. There are no corporate owned semi-trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day. This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it. In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants, this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen. If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival, there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes. 

I often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 12:30 they would be out of half of everything on the menu, which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then, Mrs. White's was open Monday through Friday from 11:00 till 3:00, but I'd swear you'd be lucky to get anything after 1:00 - and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers. I'd just come back on another day. 

To say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement, today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below. I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe. They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations. Funky little hole-in-the-wall family-run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone, but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesn't always come wrapped in a sterile designer package, then you might get along with Mrs. White's.

I love this place and hope I always will."}
{"text":"Chicken - so good!!   It's definitely a hole in the wall but our service was great and friendly.  Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner.  I'm not a cornbread expert - but, damn it was good. Worth the trip to enjoy great southern fried chicken."}
{"text":"Sorry, I see some \"rave\" reviews but this place was not even up to \"Dive\" standard for me.  I had been by this place, read reviews, was so excited to try it and finally got a chance to go in and eat...so excited...and then, SO DISAPPOINTED! Went there during a Diamond Back's game, no one in there except one gentleman sitting at the barstool waiting for his order.  Got in there around 1:12 p.m., and we didn't get our food until 2:20. So wanted to leave but we felt uncomfortable leaving when we had already ordered, I had waited so long to try it and we were the only one's in there for the last half hour...awkward.  We could not believe it took over an hour to get our food, AGAIN, we were the only one's in there for over a half hour! We ordered the chicken and it came with two sides and a piece of cornbread. The cornbread was so dry my 9 year old niece almost choked trying to force done a small bite.  I didn't believe her so I tried, it was so dry I put it down without finishing; note to restaurant, YOU CANNOT microwave corn bread back to life!  I will say this, I did finish it only because I was waiting over an an hour for food...it became a \"eat in hunger desperation\" thing.  

Once the food finally came, and AGAIN, still the only customers (that should have been my tipoff...UGH), it was not impressive.  The chicken was nothing special, nothing.  I make better at home.  The side of Mac n'Cheese was good and thank goodness something was good...not great, just good.  I had the green beans, again nothing worth remarking that another restaurant could not do.  I don't know if it was just because I was so hungry or whatever, I ate all my green beans and Mac.  Nothing spectacular, and nothing I will ever go back for.  

Service was horrible, they were not even ashamed of the crap service, didn't even bother to give us another piece of dry-arsed corn bread and only checked on us once.  I went, I ate and was NOT impressed.  

Go, judge for yourself.  Sadly, I know you will probably be disappointed.  You will have an appreciation for the expression \"Meh.\"  They are over-priced and over hyped.  Glad I got it out of my system.  I could give them more than 1 star but that would be dishonest."}
{"text":"Both times we've been there the food was amazing!  Keep in mind if you're concerned with ambiance & great service this isn't the place for you.  Just plan on overlooking or not caring about great service because the food is DELICIOUS! The chicken fried steak is the absolute best we've ever had, the mac & cheese is amazing as well as their known favs fried chicken & pork chops."}
{"text":"Damn. That chicken. The mac and cheese. The best I've ever had. And I'm old. I've had a lot. The cabbage. The sweet potatoes. The gravy. I wanted to cry it was so dang good. We're literally getting take out for dinner tonight even tho we just ate lunch there."}
{"text":"Great stuff. Will not leave hungry or didappointed. Get the pork chops and mac n cheese!

Word of caution: you may need a designated driver. No alcohol, just a great food induced fatigue."}
{"text":"Want dinner like grandma cooked?  Want comfort food?  This is the place.  Might be a little more than you expect to pay but well worth it and tons of food served.  Love the Corn bread!  Fried chicken, yummy veges and mac and cheese!  Try it soon!  You wont regret it!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday, pleasant atmosphere not much in the way of art but signatures of those that had been at the place. Ordered the chicken, with black eye peas, mustard mixed greens and fried okra. It was great, food was really hot and the server was good. The server Carlos came around often asking about drink refills, I even inquired about the Oxtails which I have never had, they brought out a sample and it was really good.I'm not sure why there are numerous 1 or 2 stars but I thought the food was good. The building has been around for a long time and not modern but it doesn't matter when the food is this good. At least my opinion!"}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME!!! 
Unfortunately I've grown a bit jaded by soul food joints. Typically a cafeteria style-set up, with grouchy, attitutde-y women working the line. Even if you try to be fun, you won't be able to crack a smile. 

Mrs. White's is not that. 

The first soul food joint that has it all! The employees were so SO nice. Engaging in coversation, our waitress was very articulate and so cute. The bus boy was engaging, and the owner/manager, was just a hoot! 

The food! Delicious, large portions!
1. Fried chicken- mmmm mmmm, big chunks, well-spiced, finger lickin good, and no skimping!
2. Sweet potatoes- sweet, sugary, good
3. Mac n cheese- pretty standard
4. Red beans and rice- this was a twist to the usual red beans and rice. 
5. Corn bread- would've liked some butter or honey butter. Yum

The ambiance is killer--tagged up all over the walls! Super cool!

I hope to go back when I'm in Phx. Great service, people, and food."}
{"text":"I will start this review off my saying I lived in Georgia for many years and I know what good, down home cooking should be. Mrs. White's is the best you will find in Phoenix, hands down. The fried chicken and mac are great but what I really love is the catfish, it is fried to perfection. The sweet tea is also sweet, something I can't say about a lot of places. Check it out!"}
{"text":"The best fried chicken & fried pork chops in town. Ox tails is one of the specials, a very tender meat. Corn bread, and the tastiest mac n cheese ever."}
{"text":"Mrs. White's was EVERYTHANG and more! I was ordering for 4 adults, had two fried chicken plates and two smothered pork chop plates. The pork chops were so tender that they could be cut with a plastic knife. The fried chicken was crispy. Make sure to go before closing. We went an hour before closing and they were out of many sides that we wanted but that wasn't their fault. We had orders of mixed greens, sweet potatoes, black eyed peas and rice and gravy. We also ordered banana pudding. It was watery but again because I went before closing, I won't subtract a star for that. Everything tasted so good. I imagine we were getting the bottom of the barrel! All and all great spot and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Mrs. White's is the biggety bomb! 

I don't know how else to say it. I can't believe there was only one review so far. This place deserves better!

If you like southern aka food, this is the spot. It is 100% authentic.

My favorites - anything on the menu.

The collard greens are perfect.

The okra gumbo is perfect.

The fried chicken, plain or smothered (in gravy) are perfect.

The pork chops are perfect. Just don't tell my Rabbi I said that. ;)

The catfish is perfect. DOn't tell my Rabbi about that one, either, mmkay?

The cornbread is perfect.

The red beans and rice... perfect.

Starting to see a pattern here?

A few tips:

Get there early. They start to run out of stuff if you show up too late.

You can order a meal and then things by the piece. Like, order the catfish and a chicken thigh or something.
 
They don't have soda. They do have tea. Sweet tea (already sweetened - too sweet for me but very authentic southern) or unsweetened.

Order extra cornbread. It comes with the meal but you'll thank me.

If you don't have room for dessert, get it to go. The peach or whatever cobbler they have is kick ass, as is the bread pudding.

You will get seated and then order. They don't bring a bill to your table, you go up to the counter when you're done, tell them what you ordered, and pay there. That's why it's called the 'Mrs Whites Golden Rule.' Make sure to leave a good tip. They deserve it.

Being a regular will get you better service, but you aren't going there for the service. You're going there to eat. 

There's a good chance you'll spot some Phoenix sports stars. I don't know who they are because I don't follow sports, but you can pretty much pick em out.

They are only open for lunch. 

That's pretty much all you need to know. Bring your friends or coworkers, enjoy, and plan to endure a 3 hour food-induced coma when you're done."}
{"text":"If you want to eat fried chicken the way southern black people eat it at home with all the fixings this is where you need to go. Collard greens, black-eyed peas,  and Kool-Aid to wash it down. A calorie infusion that will put a smile on your face and cholesterol in your bloodstream. Food the way it used to be. Don't go for the atmosphere, go for the food.  I see some people don't appreciate it. Not only did we, but apparently it's still loved by many since LoLo's opened up. Same people."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but the restaurant was very unclean,please do not go into the restroom you will lose your lunch. The Waitress was less than enthusiastic about customer service. Not to mention the prices are ridiculous for the scene and the food. Save time and money go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food was delicious fried chicken cabbage and black eyed peas were darn good chicken fried steak green bean with potatoes were out standing everything was served timely and steaming hot corn bread was a treat."}
{"text":"This place has been around since I was born and critics seem to love this place. I am a big fan of Lolo's so this place should be even better right? I brought two of my foodie friends and we were excited about trying this place. Our high expectations were shattered with the worst service I've ever had and just downright lame food. The \"world famous fried chicken\" (which took 20 minutes to bring) tasted like Banquet frozen chicken. The server brought our cornbread 10 minutes after our lousy chicken. We had no silverware for a while.  My other colleague ordered the special ribs. He compared them to the McRib sandwich which I thought was an insult to Mickey D's. The men's bathroom didn't have hand towels to add to our misery. The coup de gras was we paid $16 for a crappy chicken plate and an iced tea. 
Everybody has a bad day but if you've been around for 48 years, you have no excuses."}
{"text":"I love me some Mrs. White's. It's been a few years since I've eaten here and boy have I missed this place and their delicous food.
On my recent visit I ordered the catfish with green beans and okra gumbo (a Friday only special) and to drink sweet tea.
The sweet tea was just right. It wasn't overly sweet, it was perfect. 
The food was just as great as I remembered. The catfish was seasoned just right. The okra gumbo was yummy with lots of okra, black eyed peas and corn.
I had remembered that the menu was written on the wall, but to my surprise they had printed menus. 
I noticed that they seem to be open on weekends now which is awesome because now I can enjoy Mrs. White's more often."}
{"text":"Ok the food is worth trying I will give them that. But the way they lie and treat you the customer is just awful. We originally ordered catfish and they came back about 4 minutes later and told us they didn't have catfish. A customer walked in about 20 minutes after that and when the waitress said they didn't have catfish the big man that runs the place spoke up and said \"yes yes we do have catfish\". I think he only told that customer they have catfish because he is biased. I am white and they didn't want to serve white people the good stuff it was only for their special guests or other black people. The waitress didn't smile once; when i asked if they had coca cola or dr. pepper she said \"NO!\" in a very hateful tone and looked at me like i was scum. I felt like I wasn't welcome there the whole time I was there. Gave me the suspicious eye. Let's get rid of the prejudice people. We. Can. All. Get. Along. Anyways if your black, they will call you brother or sister and give you the royal treatment but whites should stay away unless you want shitty ass service."}
{"text":"O-M-G!!! I LOVE MRS. WHITE!!! (And her chicken)

We actually saw a brief piece on the Food TV channel about Mrs. White (The Best Thing I Ever Ate Show... on Fried Chicken). So we knew we had to go. We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!

We got there about 7PM on a Friday night... and the place was really dead. Only one other table...there was also a lot of writing on the walls... so I was a little \"nervous\". But Deseree (our server) made us feel at home. 

The menu is easy... ALL meals are $13 buck. You choose from several main entrees... and about 8 southern soul food style side (you can pick two). 

I ordered the fried chick, sweet potatoes (yams) and the black eyed peas. My wife got the same but had the mac and cheese. 

You must also order the Kool-Aid... HUGE glass... and many childhood memories. 

You get three ***HUGE** pieces of PERFECTLY seasoned (and cooked) fried chicken... and the two sides... unbelievable! The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL! 

We could not even finish half of our meal... and we took home an order of Mrs. White famous Peach Cobbler, which we enjoyed with coffee after we got home. TO DIE FOR!

In summary... GREAT MEAL! Great casual (almost divey) atmosphere. It was fun reading all the famous signatures on the wall. 

Thank You Mrs. White!!"}
{"text":"When you go to Mrs. White's you will get down home food. You will also get down home service, which means prepare to be ignored while the staff talks and laugh among themselves.

The food was good but the only problem is if you go two hours before closing time they will be out of most (if not all) of the side dishes and desserts, which is very odd. You rarely find it crowded (except maybe on Sundays after church) so it seems as if they would rather have less sides or just enough than too much. I can't imagine a restaurant constantly \"running out of food\" all the time.

It took us about 45 minutes to get our food and only after the waitress told us every 15 minutes they had no more mac and cheese, then no more sweet potatoes, then no more greens. 

The chicken was very good and so was the cornbread, but I've been here several times and the service is the same.

As we were looking to pay our bill the owner (or someone related to Mrs. White I assume) was on the phone talking to someone about going out that night, over charged us, swore we owed more than we did (all the while he's still having a conversation on the phone) and when we finally told him he over charged us he just said \"oh\".

The food isn't enough to make up for the service and vanishing dessert and sides options, so I think I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Mrs. Whites food is awesome. Homecooked meals, all delicious and mouthwatering. Service can be a little slow at times, but it's worth the wait, so if you don't have any patience in waiting for your made to order amazing food, then you may want to go when you have time. It's a very small place so you may want to take that into consideration if you are going with a large party. Only complaint, is that one waitress messed up on my drink order and forgot to bring us our corn bread (which is amazing btw). I didn't bother to mention my drink order mix up because it was getting pretty packed and she seemed overwhelmed, so I drank my lemonade that was supposed to be tea. Which was good too, so I didn't mind. I give the food an A+++, Waitservice (on this day) C-.  I'll always go back when I'm craving homecooked southern/soul food."}
{"text":"First time today and was very happy with the food.  Good portions, well done and we really enjoyed it.  A tad over priced, however. Everything is $13 and not sure the reflects the portions etc.  However, I will be back"}
{"text":"Oxtail. Collard greens. Yams. Fried pork chops & red beans - cabbage, golden fried chicken, & sweet Kool Aid. Need I say more? A Valley original! 808 E. Jefferson! Downtown Phx. You won't be disappointed by the hot juicy fresh gelatinousness!"}
{"text":"Service takes a minute so chill. They're not in a rush. 

Food tastes homemade and isn't loaded with sodium so go here if you don't want the itis from eating at Lolo's. #botharebombthough 

Can't go wrong with fried catfish or the fried chicken. Their side options are simple but simple & delicious, similar to boston market sides minus the processed taste. 

Been meaning to try their chicken fried steak for a while but they close hecka early. Biggest con. 

This place isn't going to WOW you, but 
If you're craving fried chix or a thanksgiving plate during the day, this place is a solid option."}
{"text":"I went to visit my daughter in Phoenix, I search Yelp to find a good restaurant to take her to since she is new to the area.  I came across Mrs. Whites and read all of the GOOD reviews!  Boy o Boy was I VERY disappointed.  I did not find the chicken good at all, service was slow and the plates came out one at a time minutes apart.  It was Friday night 10/21/11 abt 9pm and they were out of a couple of dishes.  When I think of Kool-aid (growing up Black) i think of it as flavorful and to be honest, a little too sweet. It was neither.  I had the chicken with sweet potatos and cabbage, the cabbage looked nice but was, oh so bland, i did like the sweet potatos.  To be fair let me tell you what my boyfriend and daughter thought...they LOVED the chicken.  So to each his own, they are not writing this review.  I would not go to this place again"}
{"text":"Downhome feel aka not pretentious and you don't have to dress up to come here. The owner is certain to drop by your table with \"How you doing baby,\" and well it gives me the warm and fuzzies.   Walls are tagged by customer's praise. Seriously just pull out a marker and write lol.  Not fancy at all. But what do you expect from a restaurant who offers koolaid as a drink? RED Koolaid lol.

Servings are eye opening.  I was expecting the usual servings but based on the amount of food on my plate I was wondering if they were implying that I needed fattening up. 4 chicken wings sides of cabbage and yams YUM!

The Food Channel happened to be filming \"The best I Ever Ate.\"  Seems someone sent  a word of praise to the network. It was interesting to witness the production process.  

Havent had such a down home feel since I left charlotte north carolina. And it felt good. I'll be back...for the chicken and waffles ;)

pros: sit back \"and rest your nerves\" feel. Decent servings. Koolaid. Not pretentious at all. Opened to 2am Fri and Sat..come right after hitting up the night scene. By the light rail too!

cons: The heartburn that soon occurs.Pepto anyone?"}
{"text":"Went here for my lunch hour, catfish was the bomb! Better than momma made it! Lol service was quick and friendly, will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Let me lay this out: Come here for the food. Not the service. Not the cleanliness. Nothing else, but the food. This has the best friend chicken in all of Phoenix. 
I heard of this place when talking to a few people around the area. They warned me that it a little run down, but its all about the food. 
We ordered smothered fried chicken, green beans and mac and cheese. BEST FRIED CHICKEN IN PHOENIX... idk what they put in the breading, but its amazing. The mac and cheese is the cheesiest. I honestly couldnt tell you what was better, the chicken or the sides. 
The service is a little slow, we had a few different servers during the meal but they were all so friendly. 
Again, come for the food, because in the end, thats all that matters!"}
{"text":"It's not just soul food. It's AWESOME SOUL FOOD!! This is home cooking and comfort food at its best. Dieters are not welcome here. I was in Phoenix for 4 days and ate here 3 times. Their fried chicken, smothered pork chops, collar greens, black eyed peas and rice were fantastic. The service was slow because of the place being so busy. But, their customer service made you feel like you were waiting for a meal from grandma. (the waitress kept on calling me \"darlin'\" and \"sweetness\") The decor consisted of autographs written all over the walls of famous people ranging from professional athletes to President Bill Clinton. On my last visit, I scarfed my food down so quick that the waitress felt like they didn't give me enough food. So, when I paid my tab. She gave me a to go box of dirty rice, fried chicken, collar greens and velvet cake for free. I think she did that because I told her it was my last night staying in Phoenix and that we didn't have soul food this good in the Bay Area."}
{"text":"Where to start? 

Let's start by addressing the false advertising on their website.  After hearing a few people talk about how good the food is there , we wanted to give it a try.  We viewed their website and if you look under Entrees, you will see the meals are all priced at $10.18 per plate.  Good deal! 

We arrive at the place and our first impressions are, the place needs cleaning and a paint job.  Most anyone can look past how a place looks if the service is great and the food is really good.  Most dive places I've been to have both... so the decor isn't something I get hung up on. 

Service...  marginal at best.  Some guy... guessing the owner... arguing with the staff, singing... just doing whatever.  I guess this is acceptable since he owns/runs the place?  Not the best thing to do in front of customers. (again... it's a dive... not expecting 5 star services)

Server---  stops my wife in front of the bathroom door to ask if she knows what she wants to order.  Maybe wait until we are all seated and ready to order?  Thought this was pretty strange! 

Now the food comes out.  Chicken wasn't horrible, wasn't great.  The canned mac-n-cheese... right up there with the best High School cafeteria mac-n-cheese.... not good!  Right from a box or can... no flavor... not homemade.   Very disappointing to say the least.  The greens... again... from a can... maybe some additional seasoning added... but.. odds are... if they were too lazy to make real mac-n-cheese... then they were too lazy to make real greens.  Gravy on the chicken... same sad story... from a box/can.... just not good or great. 

Dessert--- sweet potato pie   not bad... probably one of the better things ordered.  What was crazy... if you can imaging this... take a normal/decent size slice of pie... now cut that in half and this was the serving size we got.  All for $4.99 a slice. NUTS!  $10 for two slivers of pie. A joke! 

Remember I mentioned the FALSE ADVERTISING at the beginning of this review.  All meals $10.18.  NOT TRUE!  The site hasn't been updated in who knows how long? 

You sit down and the menu does not show the pricing... only mention of pricing is the Ox tales for $15.00.  So... you would assume from the website the meals are $10.18 each.  WRONG....  for  two meals, two very sad/small slices of pie.... $41.00 

No breakdown of the pricing ... the owner/manager just punched up some numbers on the calculator and that was the bill. 

All in all... this place needs new management... some passion put back in to  the kitchen... and they need to update/clean the place.  Not to mention... in this day and age... no excuses to not having an updated website.... to properly reflect your business and pricing.  I have a feeling when Mrs White was running this place... it was awesome... not anymore. 

Bad experience.. not even close to being worth the money spent. Avoid this place...save your money....

Will not be going back... will not recommend this place to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Okay here's an update. I've been back to Mrs. White Golden Rule. I can admit the food was becoming very inconsistent in its flavor but this weekend I had a veggie tray and it was done just right! Please keep whomever is back there... they have something right! This is the 2nd Sunday's that we've been blessed with this cooks exquisite fine cooking of soul food! As much as I'd love to give 5 stars, the cornbread is still lacking something but this minor setback won't stop me from visiting Mrs. Whites Golden Rule"}
{"text":"As a die hard Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles fan, I was highly skeptical to try this place when my coworker raved about how good it was. So standards were set pretty high... we went for lunch on a weekday and I was prepared for a laid back atmosphere and probably not the fastest service but that \"the food makes up for it\". We ordered sweet tea and waited about 10 mins until another server came by and asked for our drink orders again. We both said we ordered the sweet tea and she responds \"sure, I'll bring it out\" to my surprise I get handed a regular unsweetened tea with SWEETENER PACKETS!!! What kind of sweat tea is this?! But I decide to not say anything and just wait for our food. So our food comes and we never receive the corn bread which is supposed to come with the meal so I'm just not very impressed at this point. Then ANOTHER server asks to refill our drinks and we say we had ordered sweet tea, SHE COMES BACK WITH SWEET TEA!!! Like where was this tea when I first ordered it and why didn't I get it???? Very disappointed in this place to say the least and I have to say that I make better greens than theirs tasted"}
{"text":"A True Phoenix land mark for Soul-food. I've been coming here for almost 30 years. A lot of history here. Food is excellent, but service can be slow. I'm a Big fan of their smothered liver and onions. Catfish was also good, as was the chicken. If you enjoy Lo Lo's, try the original. (Lo Lo's Mama)"}
{"text":"I'm a huge proponent of The Golden Rule. Ever since I was a little girl the words \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\" has resonated with me. Clearly, to Mrs. White The Golden Rule goes a step further to making truly delicious soul food.  The place is quaint and feels like you're sitting down to eat at somebody's home or at a church dinner.  There is simply no substitute for Mrs. Whites.  From the cornbread to the catfish everything is seasoned superbly.  Real soul food with real soul. Guaranteed."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5
I ordered the chicken fried steak. It was delicious, enough said. 

Service: 2/5
One person got their food within 15 minutes, the next couple got it 10 minutes later, and we finally got all of our food after an hour had passed. They are very slow at cooking. 

Atmosphere: 2/5 
It's kinda cool seeing the signatures.... but it's not great looking in there; kinda divey.

Waitress: 5/5
Doris was amazing. 

Value: 3/5 
A little pricey but not too outrageous. 

Overall I would say 4/5, definitely worth a visit for the food."}
{"text":"Proper southern food like fried chicken and fried pork chops. If you're someone who likes collard greens and okra and such, then you're home.

I went with the regular fried chicken, which was a good portion of three pieces, properly battered and very crispy. As good as any chicken I've had in the Southeast. The green beans were a little overdone but the mac & cheese was excellent. Firm, tangy, and some of the browned edges in my bowl. Yum!

I was a little worried that they were cash only, but yes, they *do* accept cards."}
{"text":"We came here to try what a soul food means and the outcome was tremendously great, exceed our expectation, this was 2 years ago and now we are back to Phoenix just to watch football game and heading back to California, and there is no way that we won't stop by at Mrs. White to grab something to munch..... This definitely complete our day specially the fried chicken and the banana pudding.... plus the amazing people that makes your day !!!"}
{"text":"This chicken was awesome. It was pretty darn delicious. HOWEVER, the inside of the chicken, how disappointing... It taste like the chicken hadn't really had time to marinade? The skin was seasoned perfectly and crispy so I made sure to get a bite of that in with every piece of meat.

The mac-n-cheese, mushy and not very tasty. The potato salad, yums!! Very good on that mix. And the corn bread, how disappointing. It was dry and tasteless. I was really looking forward to it too because corn bread and soul food, hand in hand right?? Not so much here :-\

I wanted to try Lolo's up the street but I think they were closed for construction or something. For some reason I have a feeling that place would be more of what I was looking for."}
{"text":"It's a shame I'm not allowed to leave NO STARS because that is what this joint deserves.  Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe isn't \"golden rule\" at all because if this group of people came to my place, I'd feed them better and treat them friendlier then they ever did me. 

After the New Times Best of 2011 came out, this place won(!) and  I made note to visit the place soon and  the best it got all night were two female dishwashers, in the parking lot, smoking, who could not have been nicer with their welcome.

But that, my friend, is as good as it got.  The waitress, and calling her a waitress demeans all perfectly good servers across the valley, she would not get up from her seat at the counter to serve me!  She merely slid the menu across the counter to me and said, in a very unfriendly voice, whaddya havin'?

The owner sat behind the counter counting his money -- SERIOUSLY -- and bragged to no one listening how he'd seen the same Casino-B Act three times in a day the day before.  Wow.

The chicken came, it was good.  I paid $21 for a plate of fried chicken, all white meat, black-eyed peas and another memorable side I cannot recall.  They were out of mashed potatos.  HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF MASHED POTATOES?  OH, WAIT, WATCHING A B-LIST CASINO ACT 3 TIMES IN A DAY MIGHT TAKE AWAY FROM KITCHEN PREP DUTIES, NO?!!!!!

I told my friend on the way home what a scam that was.  I said one original recipe whole breast from KFC would be as good or better.  We stopped at the next KFC...and I was right!  $2.47 for one whole breast from KFC vs. $21 --- PER PERSON! -- at Mrs. White's.  STAY WAY AWAY FROM MRS. WHITES!

This guy, this family should get down on their hands and knees, every night and thank God for Jerry Colangelo, the Diamondbacks and the gentrification of their neighborhood.  It allows, at least, a couple of casino shows per night!

The sycophants who've written before me must want to misinform you:

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  I WASTED MY MONEY FOR YOU!

update 1/20/13-a private message from Tony accuses me of racism.  Really?  What did I say here that was racist?  That I didn't like the food?  That's not racist.  That's the food. That the owner was counting his money?  Again, not racism.  The only thing racist here is Tony.

The food here is VASTLY OVERRATED!  I'M TELLING YOU, EL POLLO LOCO has better chicken than this DUMP, by FAR!  And you don't have watch an extremely fat waitress refuse to get up...oh, wait.  She can't.  She's too fat."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken anywhere in Arizona and the service is great I will definitely be back here once a week"}
{"text":"I kind of experienced some reverse racism here.. and it really pissed me off... yeah, I'm white.. doesn't mean I don't crave some great soul food once in a while.. thought the whole point of the golden rule was to leave your money on the table.. as I'm leaving.. dude asks me if i'm going to pay? tld him money was on the table...did'nt question any of the african american folk...  really ticked me off.. plus, cash only, real limited menu, no waffles, corn on the cob, mashed, really limited sides..and kind of mediocre IMO.. Staceys and lolos kick its ass... (Shrug)"}
{"text":"We wouldn't have Lolo's if it wasn't for Mrs. White. This food is amazing and a Phoenix institution. Great chicken and feels like momma made it. But you know your momma can't cook so go here! Lol. Sides like homemade and dessert that you catch the itis from."}
{"text":"The pork chop and country fried steak were amazing.  The Mac n cheese was pretty special too.  I prefer my Mac n cheese to be really creamy and cheesy.  Their Mac was neither but just had a solid seasoned and cheese flavor.  The gravy was awesome.  I had rice and gravy also and I loved it. It's a must do.  Just don't look for soda.  You'll be drinking sweet tea or kool aid.  Great place!"}
{"text":"I had been hearing about this place for a long time and since I was downtown with my wife decided it was time to have some fried chicken and black eyed peas. Just to let all of you know you can order healthy from the menu, which is written on the wall but really what would be the point of excusing you from the best fried chicken in Phoenix? 

The drink menu is not vast, 3 different drinks and that is it. I suppose the charm of the place is that, well, it is what it is, its a good eats in downtown phoenix that does not try to be anything else. Its not heart healthy but who wants to live forever and its not as it your going to make this a staple in your day to day eating."}
{"text":"Good food with piss poor customer service. Will not be returning or bringing my out of town guess."}
{"text":"The food was ok..the service was terrible. They forgot to bring out full order several times. The wait time to get their attention is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I would've given it a 5 if it was just based off the food. The food was delicious, no complaints about the food at all. The service was HORRIBLE, absolutely horrible. We waited about 15 minutes to even get acknowledged. They gave one of us tea instead of lemonade and waited about 10-15 minutes for them to bring us the lemonade. One of the people in my group only ordered Mac and Cheese. We all received our food but they didn't bring her Mac and cheese. We waited another 15 minutes and asked three different people for the Mac and cheese before receiving it. Also, two of the guests had a side of red beans that was not brought out with their meal. We asked all three employees at least 2-3 times for their red beans and rice. Finally one order was brought out but not the other. So then we had to wait even longer for the second order to come out. This was after asking another 2-3 times about the red beans. 
 If I ever eat here again, I'll see about calling ahead and ordering for takeout. Like I said, the food was delicious.. I ordered the vegetable plate and it was amazing. The service just made this a miserable experience though."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Had the fried chicken, sweet potatoes and Mac n cheese - everything was really good. When I am back in Phoenix again, I will be coming back."}
{"text":"The topic of Mrs Whites would frequently come up in the office place by a coworker who used to work near there, at the New Times. This past week though it came up quite often, often enough that on Monday, when we were planning our lunch out together for Thursday, we were so hungry by talking about Mrs Whites that it only took until shortly after 11 for us to pile in her car and head out for some good ol' soul food. 

I can't even begin to tell you how wonderful this place is. It's like walking into Grandma's kitchen and getting all those great meals you used to love and enjoy. My mouth was watering and my stomach was singing before I even had a chance to sit down. 

I like that all the meals are the same price. It makes it so much easier. I also like the selection of sides and dishes. The red kool-aid was delicious but not in a mason jar like Lolos.

The staff was very friendly. One of my coworkers was craving ox tail and it started a big discussion between us and our waitress. She mentioned that Mr. Larry might know when it was available again (they were apparently out of it that day) and he even came out to the table to talk to us. My friend also then got his ox tail. I tried it. It's really damn good. I'd probably order it if it was available the next time I came around.

I went for the 3 piece smothered chicken (fried chicken and gravy) and red beans and rice. Wow that is a lot of food. I devoured the chicken fairly quickly. It was delicious. Best friend chicken I've had aside from my Grandma's. The red beans and rice I had to package up and bring home. I had them for dinner tonight and they were just as delicious as I imagined. 

I also tasted one bite of the peach cobbler a la mode. Peaches are not one of my favorite fruits but damn did they do it right. 

If you haven't been here, it's a definite must. I'm not sure why you're still reading this. Pack up and go. Move it."}
{"text":"Fastest food I received. Literally I waited about 10 minutes for my food and it was hot and fresh. Food was delicious. Not overpriced."}
{"text":"On a spring break trip with our son who wanted fried chicken. We googled \"best fried chicken in Phoenix\" and this place was #1 on the local paper's \"Top 10 Fried Chicken spots.\"  They weren't wrong. Chicken is succulent, tender and flavorful. I got the chicken fried steak which was so yummy. These people know what they're doing. Between us, we got the red beans, Mac salad, potato salad and Mac-n-cheese as sides. All were fantastic. It's small...maybe 12-13 tables. Basically, you feel like you went to somebody's house for the best, home cooked you've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Had the pork chops, which were very good.  Meat was tender and the gravy smooth and tasty.  Had the mixed greens and sweet potatoes for sides.  Greens were cooked well and spiced, the sweet potatoes melted in your mouth.
Good food, try it."}
{"text":"Hearty meals and very filling. I prefer baked mac, but all else is pretty good. My only issues is that they're always out of desert...it's like just take desert off the menu LOL. I'd say at least try them out!"}
{"text":"Golden Rule is on point. If you're going to go on a Sunday (after church) be prepared fot a wait. Legit soul food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"looking for a modest dinner with a Louisiana bayou feel. Location was right downtown, the servers were a hoot and the food was amazing. The fried chicken was delicious with a crisp crust and moist and tender meat, the cornbread was cake like and the mixed greens and black eyed peas were the jewel on the plate ...great flavors all around."}
{"text":"Warning: this is not a fast food establishment. If you want cheap and greasy go to churches. 

This is the best soul food spot in the valley by far. Everything is made fresh to order. So you are going to have to wait for it to be made. In the meantime kick back, sip your sweet tea and take a load off while the talented chefs cook your food with love and the friendly waitress with the pretty smile pours you some more tea. The humble yet comforting atmosphere with all the great autographs are a great touch as well. If you want real soul food look no further. 

Slow down and eat, or go to Churches for mystery meat."}
{"text":"Could this have been any better?  Only if they came home with me and cooked for me everyday!"}
{"text":"DE-LI-CIOUS!!

I was about to leave for a road trip from the Bay Area all the way to Dallas. Of course, I noted all these places I wanted to stop to eat along the way.

At the last second, I decided to watch the episode of \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\" in my DVR about fried chicken. Thank goodness I did!! Or else I would have never discovered this restaurant.

First off, they sell all their meals for $10.18 (plus tax). It comes with an entree and two sides. It's a HUGE plate of food. You could really eat it for two meals. The size of their drinks are monster, too. And for only $2.17! It'll make your plate full of food look small.

I went for their infamous southern fried chicken and sweet potato and green bean with potatoes for my sides. It was the best fried chicken I've ever had! There's just enough batter to chicken. The skin is crispy and the chicken is actually moist! I could pass on the green beans (they tasted like canned green beans), but the sweet potato was awesome. The sweet potato had just enough sweetness, but you have to ignore the (possibly heart stopping) liquid it sits in. Sometimes it better not to know how some stuff are made. =P

My hubby tried their chicken fried steak with rice and gravy and potato salad. The chicken fried steak has a flavorful, thick batter but it's still crispy. It totally looks homemade. The rice is your standard stuff, but the potato salad is yummy. 

They're open 7 days a week, but they close early at 7PM, so plan an early dinner! But on Fridays and Saturdays they reopen at 9PM for their Late Night Munchiez session. It's a different menu and made up of burgers, wings and other good late night munchies. 

Come here for the chicken first though. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My sister and brother-in-law suggested we try this place for a to-go order of fried chicken. Although it took a bit to figure out what menu item/items were best for the occasion, everyone I spoke to was just AMAZING. It goes without saying that the chicken was delicious but the reason I give this place five stars is more about the people. Service with a smile, for sure! Thank you, Mrs. Whites!"}
{"text":"Terrific soul food!  They were out of chicken.  So we have to come back.  This pic is what the table should look like when you're done!"}
{"text":"Food is 5 star, if I could give service a minus I would so combined a 2. My wife and I are frequent diners here going back over 20 years and when we went on Wednesday April 11th it was the worst service ever people that came in at least 10 minutes after us were served and almost done eating before we got food. If not for the fact that I know how good the smothered pork chops are I would have walked out."}
{"text":"Interesting concept of customer service. No refills, didn't ask if we needed anything, didn't even ask how our meal was. Couldn't get the orders correct. Potato salad has to be store bought, tastes like Resers. The cabbage and greens were bland. Disappointing because they have a decent reputation.,"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my meal. This place is the real deal Holyfield, of you want some soul food with some soul. Courteous and prompt attention, my food was out on less than 10 minutes. Had the smothered chicken, greens and Mac and cheese. My compliments to the chef! Will be back to try other items such as the pork chop, chicken fried steak and meatloaf."}
{"text":"Best Fried Chicken I've ever had. I pass by this place every day when I go to work and I've been dying to try it. Came in yesterday with my bf for dinner. We both got sweet tea (which wasn't sweet enough in our opinion, but we've been spoiled by South Carolina sweet tea) but it was still good. 

I got the Fried Chicken plate with sweet potatoes and mac n cheese, he got the pork chop plate with green beans and coleslaw. When it came out, the chicken was still crackling from being taken out of the fryer. I had to wait for it to cool down, so I dug in to the sides. The sweet potatoes were delicious and the mac n cheese was so good. I tried a bite of the pork chops and almost thought I had made a mistake in ordering the chicken since they were that amazing. The coleslaw was also excellent in it's vinegar-y goodness.

But then I tried the fried chicken...and went to heaven. I couldn't stop eating it. Finger-lickin' good. They gave me a huge serving so I took the leftovers home and had them for dinner tonight. Normally leftovers don't heat up well, but these were an exception. All that remains of my dinner yesterday are the chicken bones and cravings for more. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This has got to be my worst experience in any type of restaurant or cafe ive ever been to... i brought my family today at 1230pm and decided to leave at 3:10pm because we didnt get served and we saw atleaast 4 families get served and we had got there before them. We waited 2 and a half hours to not get serviced and wasted our whole sunday afternoon in this establishment...im not the one who usually complains but this was fucking ridiculous and felt i had to complain to what we experienced today."}
{"text":"Went back today and took out another 10 vehicles as I rammed into the left lane to make the turn into the lot...
I meant to try pork chops, or catfish...nope, I couldn't get past the chicken.
Once again, this chicken did not disappoint.  I had an annoying end to this long work day when I got home with this chicken.  But as soon as I picked up the drumstick and took a bite, it ALL washed away...seriously.
Let's back up.  
When I opened my styrofoam container, I noticed that the chicken had gotten slightly moist from the being closed up for almost an hour after I got it.  I thought the experience was going to be lessened.  No.  
The drumstick was a bit soggy on the bottom from sitting so long, but like I said, I bit into it and all the annoyances of life went elsewhere and bothered some other guy.
Perfection.
Even when soggy.
Even when sitting for over an hour.
If fried chicken remains absolutely delicious even after all that, you know you've got some special stuff.
What gets me is that I saw some young folks in the kitchen, I don't know if either of them fried the chicken, but if so - someone has been teaching them the real deal.  This tastes like some old woman who has been through years of hurt and pain but also joy and love has cooked this.  Someone who KNEW what bad chicken was and KNEW how to avoid that at all costs.  Someone who cared what their food tastes like.  And if youngens' are producing this kind of fare, that deserves proper kudos.
I notice there is not a 'professional' atmosphere here.  Like another reviewer said, anything seems to go.  
Honestly?  So what.
The food is too friggin good.  Yes, we are entitled to good customer service as customers.  But like I said before, you get what you put in with the people here.  You come in with an attitude, that is what you get.
I know some people put a high high value on customer service and how staff presents themselves; I do, too.  But chicken THIS good, and I mean specifically THIS chicken that is THIS good...I can accept the very casual atmosphere here.
Yes, I wish they would put a bit more pride in their professionalism.  
But I promise you, this chicken will make lovers of fried chicken not give a flying flea's fanny about anything else.  In each experience I've had with it, the chicken is THAT good."}
{"text":"This is the worst place I have ever came to eat! Honestly I don't care about the food tasting \"good\" when the service is horrible! Ide rather pay for mediocre food and have friendly non racist servers! My husband and I came in (he's black im Mexican) and the server right away just told us to sit down anywhere and came to get our drink orders soon after two more people came in after and she took their order first!!! Left us hanging! It wasn't until I told My husband what she had done that he got her attention and had to yell across the room that we were ready to order she right away looked at my like she knew what she did . She came to take our order and took my husbands first and then I ordered and she pretended i didnt say anything! She said \"are you going to get your order?!\" With and attitude I responded I had just told her my order she responded with a oh I couldn't hear you! And the food took forever to come out! Honestly I could care less about the food after all this crap! I wish yelp had a negative star review!"}
{"text":"I came here years ago before a lady Gaga concert (great show). It was empty when we walked in and we ordered some drinks. We ordered our food and it took literally 2 hours for it to come out. There was no one in the resturant so I don't know why it took so long. I think whoever was working left. I won't come back here"}
{"text":"If you crave good ,and I do mean scrumptious,  authentic Southern comfort food, Mrs . Whites is the place to go.  The Southern fried meal is mouthwatering and you cannot go wrong with your choice of two sides...save room for desert....family homey atmosphere. ..great service...wonderful and friendly staff...am definitely Coming back next time I am in Town!"}
{"text":"This is a tough one.  I'd found out about Mrs. White's by way of Lo-Lo's, and thought I'd try Mama's food before Son's.  It was good, I'll say that.  I had the smothered chicken and regretted it immensely - fried chicken covered with gravy amounts to a mess of watery breading.  Between that and having to dig through the mess to find the bones, it wasn't exactly a lot of meat down my throat.  Mac & Cheese and white rice as my sides were good.

The ambiance?  There IS none.  I found more entertainment from the writing on the wall, which had clearly been painted over MANY times since the 60s, and the open/close sign which reads, if closed, to contact \"Jesus\".  LOL.

Unaware of the church across the street, I arrived right after Sunday services to find the place fairly full - some churchgoers, at least one newcomer party, and several regulars.  Based on the caloric content of the entrees, I wasn't surprised to see about 50% obese customers, while the rest were inexplicably thin.

As a Whitey, I can't say that I was comfortable.  Clientele is almost all Black and while they are some of my best friends, I only felt welcome because of the cordial words spoken by our waiter and the cashier at the checkout, who clearly could have beat the crap out of me with one punch.  Other than that, there were a lot of \"what are YOU doing here?\" looks from fellow customers.  I kept wishing I had brought my sista friend with me, who would have loved this place.

I'd go back, but it's not a perfect choice.  Perhaps on a Saturday when church hadn't just let out.  Also, the price is extreme - it's almost as high as Knott's Berry Farm which gives you more food for only about $2 more, and that's at theme park prices.  This is just dumpy outskirts of downtown..but again, I don't wanna judge.  I love small business and I'm proud of Mrs. White for making it this long; hope she continues for a long time to come."}
{"text":"Another great trip to Mrs. White's!  Had the southern fried chicken with mixed greens and Mac n cheese.  Everything was fresh and crispy. Chicken was crunchy but not greasy and the greens, well they were phenomenal!!!  Mac n cheese is always creamy but not runny like some. Washed down with a great glass of red kool aid and I drove home drowsy!!!  
Thanks again to the staff!!!"}
{"text":"Go there for the food, not the ambiance.  I am an expert on Chinese restaurants so no problem for me!

Four drunk conventioneers decided on a Wednesday night in August to do Soul Food.  Two starched white guys both formerly from Texas made the suggestion.  One black dude formerly from South Carolina, and me a Hong Kong Chinese who grew up in Detroit.  Quite a foursome.  We stumbled into this place near downtown while the sun was still up.  Very spartan diner with counter and a few tables.  Sharpie autographs on the wall from the famous to the not so much.  It was near closing time because we ordered and ended up being the only ones in the place when food arrived in a trickle.  I had the fry chicken with collar greens and mac cheese sides.  Wonderfully crunchy and moist inside chicken.  Sides were perfect just like my childhood friend's Mom use to make.  My buds went for the steak fried chicken and two had the fried pork chops.  I only need to say that all plates where cleaned out.  No booze.  The ice tea had me worried, but I was told its made from Phoenix's famous tap water which is full of minerals.  The was the only downside.  Don't know but if they are okay with BYOB, If so, I will return someday from San Francisco.  Recommend this place if you need a soul food fix near downtown.  Close early around 8 pm."}

{"text":"Who's got the munchies!!!!! Friday and Saturday nights till 3 am, Mrs. White's is servin' up some yummy munchies including Fried Zucchini around $3 and entrees for $13.  I had to have their fried chicken , pork chop and some gravy and rice at 12am! The fried chicken was cooked perfectly.  The skin is crispy and tasty.  The meat moist and tasty.  The portions are huge and you will not go home hungry.  The staff is friendly and helpful; always a pleasure to talk to them.  Skip Filibertos or Jack n' Box after the party..movie..concert..and go to Mrs. White's!"}
{"text":"The most amazing soul food I've had in AZ yet!! The fried chicken was perfect and not made until it's ordered, Mac and cheese was homemade and incredible and the cobbler....delicious!!! The best part, kool-aide was one of the drinks available. You get TONS of food for not a lot of money. It is absolutely worth at least one trip to try it for yourself!!!"}
{"text":"This place looks as plain as the food tastes. I could get a 3 piece meal at KFC with a drink for half the price of what  I paid for lunch here. 14.00 vs 7.00....

Just because it's homemade doesn't make it better....

The only thing good here was the Coleslaw (taste like KFC).

Keep your money and move on. There are plenty of places besides this one that serve much better food and service it's just not Mrs Whites :-("}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim after a friend in my car said that she had been dying to try this place for the longest. We figured that we had a couple hours before we had to be anything to do, so we might as well stop in for a lunch.

We walked into the old restaurant and the first thing I noticed were the walls; they had signatures of famous celebrities, artists, and athletes who had stopped by for food scrawled in every corner of the place. There were only two other patrons in the place at 2pm on a Wednesday, so service was snappy and quick. 

We were waited on by a couple waitresses who were pleasant and recommended us different dishes. I ended up getting the country fried steak and my friends both ordered the famous fried chicken. You get a couple sides with each order, and I figured I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't give their sweet tea a try. No more than 10 minutes later, our food came out and the portions were HUGE. My friends got three gigantic pieces of chicken each, and my steak seemed bigger than my face. We have a ton of black eye peas and mac & cheese scooped onto each of our plates; even the sweet tea came in a bigger-than-normal glass!

None of us came close to finishing our plates. The food was tasty and we were definitely happy that we stopped on by. The plates are a little expensive at $13, but the ridiculous portions more than make up for that. I would definitely come back again (next time, I'll have to try the catfish and okra gumbo)."}
{"text":"Three words: Incredible Fried Chicken!

Just visited this place for the first time and the food is amazing.  It's only a block from Chase Field where the Diamondbacks play and they were open until 7:00 pm on the Wednesday that I visited.  I visited in the afternoon around 3:30 and it wasn't busy.  There were three or four people at the counter and one guy in a booth.  I grabbed a booth (very comfy by the way) and was served right away.  

Their menu is very basic  (main dishes, side dishes & desserts).  I ordered the Fried Chicken dinner, which comes with two sides (described below).  My beverage: a lemonade.  They don't have soda at this restaurant, which was a bummer, but the lemonade is tasty - not too tart, not too sweet.

The fried chicken is the best I\"ve had in town.  The meal comes with three juicy pieces of mouth-watering chicken and the flavor is the best I've had in valley.  This isn't fast food fried chicken.  This is fried chicken your mama would make.  Yummy!

One of my sides was green beans with potatoes.  I've never had this combination of vegetables together before and it was really tasty.  I think the green beans were from a can but I'm not sure about the potatoes.  Regardless, this was a nice side dish.  I put a little pepper on it and I was good to go.

My other side dish was rice with gravy.  I guess I'm new to soul food because I've never heard of this combination before either.  The rice they use is excellent.  I'm not sure what it was but it had a better flavor than Uncle Ben's rice.  Some kind of gravy is mixed with the rice and the two together gave me a whole new yummy experience. 

I couldn't finish the whole meal and had to get a to-go box.  If I hadn't been so full I would have loved to try their dessert of the day, peach cobbler.  

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to people.  It's really close to downtown Phoenix and the ball park and the food is made with a lot of love, just like Mom would make."}
{"text":"This is the best comfort food you will ever have !!! The smothered chicken is the bomb - and the cornbread is the best"}
{"text":"Went on the 4th of July with only 5 others in the shop.  Beware on the one way road in front of the cafe, my GPS had me driving down the wrong way!

The staff was friendly and amazing that all entree dishes were $11.  Ordered the pork ribs and links with sweet potatoes, came with corn bread and ordered sweet tea.  The meat fell of the bone and the links were spicy.  The sweet potatoes were sweet and yummy and the greens, not too salty.

The staff was friendly and attentive and the owner's son owns LoLo's Chicken and Waffles. http://www.yelp.com/biz/lo-los-chicken-and-waffles-phoenix#hrid:KN-j7PyAgt4EGCnjUMCHTQ"}
{"text":"A colleague and I had lunch here recently.  We were both confused when the 'sandwich' he ordered off the menu was brought out; the fish was breaded but no sliced bread (explains why I didn't rate it 5 stars.  Really it's more like 4.5 stars).  Apparently the fish was good though!  I'd ordered the smothered pork chops with black eyed peas and coleslaw for sides.  To use Guy's terminology, both the chops & the gravy were \"On point!\".  The same could be said for the coleslaw ~ it had a great kick to it!  The peas were good, but not outstanding (can you make them outstanding?  I'm not so sure.).  Will be returning with The Boyfriend to try other options.  

And have more of that coleslaw."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Mrs. Whites for some time with all the great reviews. Very friendly folks with super service was a plus but sadly the food was just ok and not worth the price. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak which was tender and had a nice light coating of Gravy. It was good but not great and lacked a little flavoring or at least some salt. For sides I opted for the green beans with red potato and the Mac and Cheese. The Green Beans were directly from a can with the same juice with a crushed red potato, again no flavor or spice, really? The Mac and Cheese was a huge disappointment having had better at a Walmart Deli. I wish my phon battery was not dead as the tiny slice of stale cornbread made me chuckle, exactly 1 inch by 1.5 inch. :)  $15.86 for a lackluster meal is not what I was expecting nor would I go out of my way to go back, even to see the happy waitress."}
{"text":"A great family business run by great people. I walked in late tonight to try and get some dinner to go only to find the business was closed. However the owner (I am assuming) came to the door and asked what I wanted and then invited me in and saw that I was able to get my food still. A really classy thing to do when she could have just said they were closed for the evening and my food was still fresh and amazing. You won a customer for life in my book :)."}
{"text":"Oh my god.

Seriously.

The fried chicken is so light and crisp, I thought this dead bird was going to fly right off my plate.

The collard greens--you'll want to slap someone for serving you greens that didn't taste like this.  They are a gift from on high, and the black eyed peas are insanely good.  Redolent with pork and seasoning, they trump any black eyed pea you have ever had.  

Cornbread is grilled and isn't the dry, crumbly, cakey crap some places have the gall to give you, and the macaroni and cheese is soupy, cheesy and perfectly cooked, just like you wanted.

I saw plates literally overflowing with smothered pork chops and chicken, and if I hadn't been full to the point of a coma after eating all the chicken and greens and mac and cheese I could hold, I would have ordered some.  Or catfish.  Or neck bones.  

Desserts offered by one of the ladies who cooks walking through the dining room going \"Who's gonna have peach cobbler?\".  Who??? ME!  That's who!  Peach cobbler...are you kidding?  Do people say no??

Meals are ONE PRICE, period, ($10.18 with two sides and cornbread)and you better bring cash.  The lemonade was excellent ($2.37).


Oh my god, what wouldn't I have given to be a cow, with four stomachs.  It's worth going back to Phoenix for.  Stop here before you drop off your rental car.  You'll thank me.  So will your cardiologist."}
{"text":"The chicken was good and fresh off the frier. The workers were friendly but had to mention that our waitress needs a little \"waitressing etiquette\".  I asked her if the okra gumbo is spicy and she replied that she doesn't know 'cause she doesn't eat the stuff!"}
{"text":"Great southern fried chicken! 
Simple menu with standard options.
I ordered the regular chicken plate with black eyed peas and mac n cheese. 

Can't wish to go again!"}
{"text":"Mrs. Whites....
Mrs. Whites....

I. WOULD COMMIT A CRIME FOR THOSE COLLARD GREENS

2. Fried chicken... I dug the remnants out from under my finger nails and ate them...

3. Red beans and rice. Damn.

Old school feel, old school food, better than than any new school BS that some yuppie is eating at his local vegan restaurant.

Be bad and order some good.

Get the Golden Rule."}
{"text":"First off I would like to punch the dip Shit on the food network who said this was the best chicken he ever ate. Yeah the place is filthy, but how they operate their business is redicolus. Service sucks, 49 minute wait for the food sucks, waiting 20 minutes from the first  entree being dropped off until the last person luckily receives their food sucks, being told on the 59th minute of a hour wait for your food, that they are out of your side dishes, sucks, spending my hard earned money at a place that is Ass backwards in any kind of business sense, sucks. At first our group thought it was a joke, then the reverse racism theory was brought up, then we noticed that every table was experiencing the same lack of service. Black, white, purple,orange. They just sucked."}
{"text":"This place charges $15 a PLATE for a meat and two sides....that would be fine if it were in a comparable location and somewhere you wouldn't mind eating in...instead the place is dirty, old and they charge for EVERYTHING....debit card usage - there's a charge for that (which is illegal)..if you specify which pieces of chicken you would like instead of what they give you - that's a extra charge...if you use the ATM machine located inside etc....

The food itself is BLAND...in case anyone hasn't noticed, the candied yams and greens are from a can - called GLORY, yes you too can have this at home, the gravy is bland and lack seasonings...if you get red beans and rice - there's your 2 sides...it's not a combo like one would expect.

Overall the chicken and anything else here fried is great, but the box mix cornbread (May be Jiffy but it taste like Glory also) and \"urban\" decor is a no-go. If you spend $50 for 2 ppl to eat (which you will here if you get a drink) you're better off going for a descent steak dinner instead.

I'm sure these folks have remained in business due to the businesses in the surrounding area and \"other\" folks that don't know what true soul food tastes like (see Amera's review lol) so they are more than happy to hand over their money and call it THE BEST THING EVER...But Mrs. White and her friends/family (whoever works the place) would be laughed out of other authentic soul food/Southern areas of the country..

This is the equivalent to Taco Bell serving Mexican Food and calling themselves Carolina's."}
{"text":"The best breaded catfish ever, collard greens were on point  and the corn bread was real corn bread. Fried chicken was a little to over fried for my taste but the chicken itself was great"}
{"text":"This is nice hole in the wall with a lunch counter place. The menu is solid soul food. The mixed greens and sweet potatoes were ok but that cornbread was great!! I wanted the cabbage but it wasn't ready when I ordered :(. The fish that I tasted on my friend's plate could have used more seasoning. Rice and gravy needed more seasoning too. If I ever come back to Phoenix, which I probably won't I would try a different restaurant. But if you are close to airport and want some soul food this a place to try out."}
{"text":"Stopped into Mrs. White's Golden Rule the first time in a few years. This local joint has been a staple in Phoenix since 1964!!  I use to stop in here several times a year when working in the downtown area. 
Today I opted for the same dish I use to always get: Catfish, rice w/gravy, and green beans w/ potatoes.  Just as good as I remembered and what I was hoping for.  Portion sizes are smaller than they once were but are now a perfect portion size for a full meal. Catfish had a good crunch with the fish still being moist and tender. The gravy could use some more salt & pepper but the green beans with potatoes were great. 
Decor wise: this restaurant is about as simple as it gets. Plating is also simple but has improved over the years. The real star here is the food as it should be. Highly recommended this Phoenix staple when in the downtown area."}
{"text":"My wife & I only ate here once but it was disappointing in comparison with all the high accolades given. While the service & pricing was fine, we were not nearly so impressed with the quality of the food. I certainly would not rate it to be poor, but it was nothing worth repeating. We both felt it was just typical diner quality food. The fried chicken was similar to eating Church's. Sorry folks, I have no desire to return."}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch before the Diamondbacks game.  Despite it being close to 2:00 PM, it was pretty busy. The waitstaff was very friendly, but overall I found them to be quite slow and inattentive.  We were waiting for what seemed like an eternity when one of the waitresses (not the one who took our order) quipped \"Are y'all movin' in or what?\".  She immediately went to check on our order and brought it out a couple of minutes later. I had the fried chicken with macaroni and cheese and green beans as the sides. My companion had chicken fried steak with mac/cheese and black eyed peas.  We both agreed the food was OUTSTANDING.  Kick up the service a couple notches and I will gladly give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went back to Mrs. White's for lunch yesterday.  The food is to die for, best fried chicken this side of the Mississippi, & the Mac & Cheese melts in your mouth.  What I love just as much is the friendly staff, they remember your face, make sure you feel welcome & go out of their way to make sure your food is right.  We took 2 people who had never been there before with us & both said they can't wait to go back again.  Do not head there if you are in a hurry, good food & good friends take time. This is not upscale froufrou food, this is good for the SOUL food, like eating dinner at your best friend's (or Gramma's) house!"}
{"text":"This is old school food in an old school building. You can almost glimpse the Phoenix of days gone by and it kind of makes you feel good to know something has withstood the test of time and the rush to make corporate eateries seem small time local (Postinos, the Yard etc.) This place is small time local and you can tell from the food and service.

Key things to note:

Menu is heavy southern fare - so come hungry
Entrees are $13-15 including 2 sides
Sandwiches are around $6 and have one side
No alcohol
Credit cards accepted
You follow the golden rule and honestly report what you ordered when you pay
They close at 7pm

My friend and I opted for sitting at the counter. Only complaint is the chairs were horribly uncomfortable. Being closer to the kitchen and staff you could see this is a family place and everyone takes care of each other. Staff was very pleasant. Bridget took good care of us.

Both our main dishes were delicious. One catfish and one fried chicken. The green beans were good as was the mixed greens. 

I read some of the bad reviews on this place and most seem unfair or specific to one encounter. Do not go into this place expecting glitz or a modern slick feel that so many \"hip\" restaurants in Phoenix have of late. This is a family run establishment that serves old fashioned food. Respect who they are and what they are doing and you'll have a good experience. If not, go wait 3 hours for a pizza at Bianco's down the road."}
{"text":"The food was great! The seasoning on the chicken was superb. The fried okra is good and the Mac n cheese is very rich and creamy. The chicken is good both smothered and classic."}
{"text":"THE best of everything, their chicken is not like any other, everything is to die for.
Their tea is freshly brewed, sweetened and unsweetened, their beans and rice are amazing.  It is across from CHASE FIELD, they have autographed ceilings, floors and walls, you never know who will show up.  It closes at 1:00p.m, so, get there early."}
{"text":"My wife loves soul food.  When I brought her to Mrs. White's, she was sold.  The atmosphere was small and felt quite authentic.  We sat and ordered fried chicken.  I had Kool -aid (red), which I have not had since I was a kid.  I forgot how delicious the red concoction was.  About 40 minutes later, our fried chicken platters came out.  My wife first said \"We could have split one\"  (\"No we could not...get your own\" I thought to myself).  The chicken was divine.  My wife magically ate all three pieces by herself.  She believes that her hands grew a mind of their own and force fed her all 3 parts, but we know better.  She raved about how delicious everything was.  I liked the chicken a lot.  The only thing that would have made the place a bit more authentic would have been some jazz or blues playing in the background.  OK, the place was fine.  Not fancy or frilly.  In fact, you can pull out a pen and leave your mark on the wall as many others have.  Try it.  Its worth the drive downtown."}
{"text":"I picked up to-go orders today for myself and my co-workers.  I have worked in down town PHX for almost 20 yrs and missed this nice place until now.  This is the first time any of us tried the food.  We all enjoyed the it, we had the pork chops and the chicken.  We loved the cabbage and the cornbread as well.  The employees here were happy and they had great customer service, and made you feel welcome. All the girls want to start ordering from here now."}
{"text":"This place is so cool! The menus are on the walls in sharpie along with signatures from a lot of local athletes. They will not present a bill to you, but rather trust you to tell them what you ordered and pay the correct amount. The food is great, artery clogging, and comes in huge portions. I like the smothered chicken with yams and green beans, and order it every time. I always want to sleep off the rest of the day too. Saturday they do a great rib plate. Good spot for those working or living in the city."}
{"text":"Well I have not been here in a while. One thing I do remember about my last visit was when you're food is ready. They would not remember to  bring the corn bread until you have eaten you're meal. I remember it took about 20minutes for you're food to be ready. This time it was about 5 min. I was shocked ut came so quick.

I see the price has went from $10.00 to $13.00. I notice the portions have decreased. 
The greens lack season per a black operated establishments.

Season the CALLARD GREENS my people.
keep enough corn bread cook.
I heard the cooks were out. 

One is having a child. The other cook is out of town.
Now Carlos was on his job trying to make sure everyone he served was happy.

It shows in the flavor somebody missing."}

potato salad....great 
service....fantastic...i mean really good...the hostess was a sweetheart...she greeted me with a smile and sat me right away...brought my drink and the cornbread immediately and the entree within 5 minutes...i was very pleased with my experience"}
{"text":"Tried for first time today after hearing a lot about it and seeing in local TV show.  Not at all impressed -- probably won't go back.  Chicken ok.  Pork chop overcooked and dry.  Rice and gravy bland.  I understand that the place is 50 years old but it really needs an overhaul. Floor, seating and all.  Bathroom definitely needs updating."}
{"text":"Great food. Good prices. Friendly service.

My friends and I ate here while attending the Phoenix Comicon not knowing anything about the place. We were pleasantly surprised. We weren't expecting soul food, but the chicken fried steak smothered in gravy and side of green beans hit the spot. 

Don't let the appearance of the building fool you (the windows are all barred up), the food is great."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what is worse; ordering my food to go, eating fried chicken, eating fried chicken in the heat, or all of the above. 

Well, rain or shine, I love eating Fried Chicken and nobody can take that away from me. So I saw this little bungalow-like restaurant, which is located a block away from Chase Field and also not far from my hotel, that serve authentic Southern and Soul food. But my dining experience and decision-making has costed me my hopeful solid meal.

I ordered the Fried Chicken dinner-combo for $12.00. The combo includes two sides with a slice of cornbread and I chose Rice and Mixed Collard Greens. I made a big mistake and opted to take my meal to-go to stuff my face with the fried chicken like a barbarian in my hotel room. My side of Collard Greens were very tasty and full of flavor, but a bit too watery, in which caused my side of rice to taste like a soup-like side and my monster-pieces of fried chicken's crispy skin and piece of cornbread were soggy. The fried chicken were very tasty, but it would've tasted a lot better if it wasn't for my misfortune. 

This restaurant accepts only cash. I should've ate in the restaurant, because the friendly workers treated me very well and strongly convinced me to eat in. I'll definitely will eat in the restaurant  next time.

The restaurant has numerous awards from various sources including having the famous Yelp-sticker posted on the front door. The restaurant is also a favorite of the NFL's Arizona Cardinals, and NBA's Phoenix Suns with numerous pictures posted all over the facility."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Fried chicken was crispy and not at all greasy. Cabbage was a little sweet which was different but good. Sweet potatoes were just sweet enough. Mixed greens were delicious! Chicken fried steak was awesome! Smiling tummies all around. Carlos and Doris were so nice and took such good care of us. Definitely recommend for a great dining experience!!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to complain that it's not a 5 star restaurant, but I figured that a Soul Food restaurant across from the oldest Black Church in Phoenix had to have good soul food! Catfish is my weakness and this place has it! Delicately fried and moist and tendered on the inside. It was perfection. I had it with mixed greens and Southern sweet tea. My Soul food cravings were more than satisfied! I WILL be back again and again!"}
{"text":"The staff is sloven and lazy. I waited 15-20 minutes to check out. The wall is covered in magic marker graffiti. The food was blah. If I was a homeless man starving and someone offered me dinner here I would refuse. Dirty floor. And bland food. They must be a place where people go once WHILE ATTENDING A DBacks game . Never again. NEVER. At most I would order a coconut and a hammer, provided they touched neither. Soulless food served slowly. Oh and the tea was rancid. From a couple days earlier. Nastiness reigned."}
{"text":"First time here. Literally everyone that came in after us got their food before us. There were a few of them who actually were able to get their food and eat it all before we were served. It was freezing and I wouldn't not recommend coming here. The food is good, but not good enough to sit around for an hour and a half while everyone around you gets there food before you. Also they were out of like half our their menu which is only like 6 items."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! The food was incredible. Chicken was hot and crispy and fresh...my son missed his drumsticks but he ate everything. Macaroni and cheese was creamy and sharp...cornbread fresh and hot out of the oven! The best cabbage EVER!!!! How can simple cabbage be soooo good? Greens were tasty and not over cooked. We didn't have room for dessert but I loved that it was free on Sundays! Service was polite and attentive. It's worth the wait if you love fried chicken. Lots of folks ordered pork chops too!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and the food has been great. The chicken is fired just right and is so juicy and tender. The mac and cheese is delicious. Their sweet tea hits the spot. My only gripe here is the decor off the place. It's looks like it could be spruced up a bit."}
{"text":"The 2 times we have gone there, they were closing.. What type of restaurant has soul food hours from 10:00-7:00? The average person gets off work at 5:00, that means you only have about a hour to get over there and eat. I will not be going back...ever."}
{"text":"Seems they got their AC fixed. Nice and cool inside. Server was so nice and polite; chicken was as amazing as always."}
{"text":"This is the first five star rating I've given on Yelp.  I have never had anything there that I didn't absolutely love.  Do not be fooled by cheap imitations (Lolo's...oh please!); nothing compares to Mrs. White's.  

Main courses:  their chicken fried steak is the best I've had and the smothered pork chops are excellent as well....extremely moist and flavorful.  

Side dishes:  I am a fool for their mac and cheese.  Mac and cheese is probably my all time favorite food and Mrs. White's is the best I have ever put in my mouth.  I also love the fact that they serve rice and gravy as a side dish.  The green beans are delicious (I rarely say that about a vegetable).  The greens are fantastic. 

Dessert:  Their peach cobbler is the first dessert I've eaten there and I won't try anything else because I would gladly eat my way out of a vat of their peach cobbler.

The ambiance may not be to everyone's liking.  I don't care.  When the food is this good, the rest of the world fades away and it's just you and the deliciousness.  Try it for yourself if you don't believe me."}
{"text":"THE BEST CHICKEN IN TOWN!  Now I've read reviews about the service and how long it takes...  Mrs White's is a hole in the wall place to eat where you feel like your neighbor is feeding you.  Very, very down to earth people you would sit down and have a beer with after a long day...  This place is not known for their fast service, like Capital Grill, they are known for their damn good food.  I don't know what they cook their green beans, but it's soooo good.  It reminds me of a fresh pot of pinto beans made with ham-hocks, amazing.  I recommend getting the chicken \"smothered\" or you will be picking off your friends plate for some gravy.  My second favorite side is the Mac and Cheese, let me top it off with some Koolaid! Again, if your looking for a place with fast service try elsewhere, but if your looking for some damn good food, this is the place that is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I loved this little restaurant. I was visiting my boyfriend for the weekend and googled this place. It had the best fried chicken we could ever want. It was really moist and juicy, but crispy. The service was good and consistent. If you want soul food that is mouth watering then this is the place. I will definitely return here in the future. Didn't have room for desserts, but I'm looking forward to the peach cobbler."}
{"text":"Greeeaaat food!  Nothing like southern home cooking.  Thank you Doris and Carlos for your hospitality"}
{"text":"Drove into Phoenix today and headed straight to Mrs. White's.  It seems we were a bit early, and we had to wait outside while it opened.  An employee came outside while we were waiting to grab a smoke.  He was friendly and started up a bit of conversation with my husband about the place.  It turns out he was one of the cooks.

When were able to finally get in, we were offered drinks, and ended up getting sweet tea, which I don't care for.  I got the smothered pork chop and two sides, the mac and cheese and the black eyed peas.  

We got a corn cake to eat while we waited and when the meal came it was pipping hot and very good. Service was excellent and prices were reasonable.  I recommend this place for some true southern food."}
{"text":"This place is home.  The epitome of southern cooking.  The food is top notch.  The staff is friendly and very attentive.  So make yourself at home and stay a while."}
{"text":"So I admit I am a food network junkie and I honestly only went to this place because I saw it on best I ever ate fried chicken episode but come on best I ever ate fried chicken in Phoenix I had to see for myself.  

Well Mrs. White backed it up with some amazing chicken and I don't know what previous reviewers were talking about with the sides because my grandma from North Carolina was in town and her and I both liked the red beans and macaroni salad.  

The staff was friendly and even sent me home with two extra pieces of chicken for later.  This place is awesome and I will for sure be a repeat customer.

Also whoever said KFC has chicken as good and it's cheaper well keep going back to KFC and stay outta places like this cause you don't belong.  Just sayin'.  KFC aint got nothin on Mrs. White."}
{"text":"I'm from the south so I know good
Soul food. Not only is this great soul food but it's possibly the only way lace in phoenix that knows how to season food correctly. Don't let the decor turn you away. What they lack in ambiance, they make up for in flavor. This is a must go!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Ordered fried chicken and pork chops. Mac and cheese, apple sauce, and rice with gravy. Sweet tea and koolaid. We may as we'll have licked our plates. Everything was absolutely delicious. And everyone working was so friendly and welcoming. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken is perfectly fried at Mrs. White's.  It's probably the best soul/southern food I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I love getting my sooooul food on occasion. (Yes, I usually leave wearing a little of it too. I really should carry a bib with me.) 
On my last visit I decided to go with the catfish and I was craving veggies so I waited on some greens and I also decided to try the cabbage. The greens were tasty, the cabbage...I guess I was kind of expecting a sauted/fried cabbage with a little more flavor, it was good but a little bland. The catfish on the other hand was perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside moist on the inside and a nice big slab of it. Sooo good. 
I rarely pass up the Kool-Ade, but occasionally get the sweet tea. 

I have enjoyed my time there and usually go when I have plenty of time to enjoy my meal. While the food is served relatively quickly, I don't know that I would recommend it for someone looking for a quick downtown lunch time fix. For me if I am going to go enjoy some home cooking, I take my time and enjoy."}
{"text":"I had dinner here one night last week. The restaurant is located very close to Chase Field and has its own dedicated parking lot in back. There is also a rear entrance if you use the parking lot or you can walk around and come in the front door. I ordered the 3 piece fried chicken meal with sides of black eye peas and rice and brown gravy for about $13. The meal came out in about 15-20 minutes. The fried chicken was very good along with the peas and rice. I really enjoyed the meal. My only complaint was that I was given 2 wings and a thigh. I can understand 1 wing but not two.give me more meat! I mentioned that to the waitress and she agreed that the kitchen made a mistake and gave me my drink for free. 

I believe this is a very good soul food restaurant. The fried chicken is scrumptious and I recommend you try it. They have a dining room to eat in and the table service was friendly."}
{"text":"We drove all the way from north Scottsdale to try the legendary peach cobbler and voted best in the southwest southern comfort food. Server was a nice man who immediately greeted us and got our drink order. Wail waiting for our order to be taken we looked around the restaurant and noticed countless awards and magazine articles about the wonderful southern comfort food and we thought we had gone to the right place. Sadly all three of us received meals that made our tummies turn. Poor Mrs white would turn in her gave if she new what had happened to her souther food dream.The chicken sandwich is two pieces of small wings that is over breaded, dry, greasy, mostly bone fried chicken put on some dry bread with a side of your choice. Who put chicken wings on stale bread and calls it a sandwich? And the fresh caught catfish is a breaded and deep-fried disaster. The Mac and cheese was okay but could have been microwaved longer and the sweet potato were tasty but very sweet. However the black eye peas were a gummy mess and the cornbread was very disappointing and covered in grease. Not to mention wail eating the employees were cleaning around us, sweeping dust up, cleaning with dirty mop water, and washing their hands in the sanitizer water gross. However we decided to still stay and try out the peach cobbler that was award winning. Hahaha it was the worst soupy mess we had had. The dough tasted like undercooked frozen dumpling that was then covered in can peach soup and heated in the microwave. After all that the total came out to 50 bucks and 10 to the server not a meal worth 10. This place might have been good at some time but the reviews are very outdated. It is sad to say that the Kool aid was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"I can't understand any review of less than a 5 for Mrs Whites! We love the food so much we had our wedding rehearsal dinner there!! Get the smothered chops and the rice with gravy - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I've never actually stepped inside the place but I had a few take out meals brought to me by my folks over the years. Whenever I bit into a piece of fried chicken or breaded pork chop, I get an image of a motherly woman painstakingly cooking for a large family."}
{"text":"My order....Red Kool-aid, chicken, sweet potatoes,   mac n cheese and corn bread. Asked for honey and hot sauce on the side. Hubby ordered the cat fish, green beans and mac n cheese.  Verdict.....same as usual. ...it's fricken delicious. Love sitting at the counter where you can catch the smells of food cooked with love wafting from the kitchen. Pricy but with it."}
{"text":"I have been to Mrs. White's twice now and I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit.  My first time I ordered the cat fish.  It was good, but really needed to douse it in hot sauce to really enjoy it.  My husband ordered the smothered pork chops only because they didn't have any fried chicken available.  I was really bummed since the fried chicken was really all that I wanted.  Service is friendly and fairly quick.

On our second visit we had the fried chicken.  I'm hoping our first visit was a fluke because the flavor and crunch on their fried chicken is to die for! We also ordered oxtail, which I had only ever tried served in a peanut butter stew (Filipino dish).  Don't let the looks fool you.  Their oxtail is so flavorful and tender.  Deelish!  For sides I had rice with gravy and greens.  You have to order the greens as a side!  I think it compliments any of their entrees.  My husband was disappointed to find that they were out of okra on this visit.

It seems that there is always something not available when we go.  I'm not too bothered by it.  I think of it as someone's home kitchen.  You eat what's available and it's almost certainly going to be comforting and delicious."}
{"text":"I'm not really big into soul food, but someone told me to come try this restaurant. Legend has it that the owner found the restaurant back in the 1910's and has kept the family business for over a century. The restaurant isn't really big, but it is a good place to have lunch if you're on a work lunch break.

I had the fried chicken with spinach and a side of macaroni. The chicken did come with some seasoning flavor, which I thought added some flavor and kick to it. I was impressed with the way the steak was cooked, and it was tender. The spinach was also good, but the macaroni seemed a little bland. However, this was a good meal to have just for lunch.

There is also chicken served here, steak, potatoes, black eyed peas, and more delicious soul food here. My mother enjoyed it and I may now be on the hunt for more soul food places. I would say the service needed some work, but the food was spot on. I would definitely say to come try it if you have an hour to spare."}
{"text":"First, all lunches are $13.00 each plus $2.15 for drinks. Too expensive for lunch.  The green beans/potatos and rice wer very good.  Generous  quantities. 

the chicken was miserabe. over cooked, dry, the crust was almost without flavor,.  There no redeaming factors. If this is true soul food, I am not doing soul again."}
{"text":"OK This cafe surprised me. I rarely give 5 stars but I had to. 
They say it on the sign \"great fried chicken and pork chops\" and they are right. I loved it. 
I was never a fan of collard greens until today. These were not the best collard green I have ever ate but the best side dish I have ever eaten. I can't stop thinking about them. The deserts were to die for. I had 3. Yes 3 deserts. Bread pudding, peach cobbler, and banna pudding. All awesome. The fried chicken was one of the best and I have had many trips looking for the best fried chicken and to think I found this one by surprise. I like the way they serve you. It's called the golden rule because you tell the cashier what you ate and he pulls out some price from his head. Funny but it was fair. I did not care for the BBQ though. Sauce was great but the meat was not up to my standards. Braised not smoked. I think it should only be smoked with a dry rub. They do take credit but a charge is added."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Best food Southern you're going to find this side of the Mississippi

Try the sweet tea. I swear I go there just for the sweet tea and catfish alone"}
{"text":"Big portions.  Really good chicken!  Not the best I've ever had but it's up there in top 3 for sure.  

Everything was nicely seasoned and the veggies were delish - I opted for the greens and the blackeyed peas.  I would actually consider the veggie plate and skip the meat because the sides were soooo good.

The cornbread was really, really good crumbled into the peas.  

Gargantuan size kool aid too!  A worthwhile stop!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few months, but tonight was just perfect.  I always get the same thing - chicken fried steak (gravy is so bomb), cabbage, and red beans and rice.  Yum yum yum.  With a drink comes out to just under $17 - so worth it.  Staff has always been very friendly, and Mr. White is hilarious."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere were perfect. We ordered standard southern comfort food and it was true to taste, not overly salty and sweet. It seems others have bad service but we were there during a weekend lunch rush and were seen in a timely fashion. It was fun reading the walls of all the famous people who had been there. My only complaint was that the bathroom wasn't air conditioned (it was July) so when I walked in, the stifling heat and \"bathroom smell\" hit me. Glad I'd already eaten! Will definitely go back when in the mood for collard greens and fried chicken."}
{"text":"Not only was the food amazing here. It was so great to have the story with a picture book told to us by our waitress. She was kind hearted. She loves her job you can tell. She told the story about the business with so much love and heart. The guy with all the tattoos like myself. It's amazing to see people not judging him and he loves his job as well. We own Rusk Lock & Key. And I run the marketing team for my husbands locksmith business and it's hard to work not knowing if people are going to judge with tattoo like myself. And I find it very cool to see businesses hiring people with tattos. Because he cares about his job. Thats the type of people you want working for you"}
{"text":"Although I'm happy I checked this place out, I'll probably never be back. The atmosphere is fun and casual and I kept feeling like I was at a diner in Memphis. The server was extremely friendly (although she forgot to bring my husband's drink even after numerous reminders). The menu is very limited. Usually I can respect a place with a limited menu because they typically do the few things they offer very well. Not so here. We had a group of about 7 and all ordered different items. The only thing that unanimously received praise were the porkchops and sweet potatoes. The mac and cheese, corn bread, and chicken all needed seasoning."}
{"text":"This is probably the best fried chicken i have ever eaten in my life. I dont know what they put in the breading but it is so crispy and addicting. I ordered the fried chicken with mac and cheese, green beans and rice and gravy. I think everything complemented each other and I am so eager to come back to try the catfish. True southern comfort food. $16.47 for the entree with a drink. Cant wait to return."}
{"text":"The food is sooo good... it makes you want to take a nap afterwards....The service was fantastic... They give very large portions ... I had to take half of my food home... I had the smothered pork chops, mac and cheese and green beans.... the Cafe reminds me of being at someone's home in the south with Southern hospitality.... It was a very sociable environment I really enjoyed my lunch there ... I didn't want to go back to work"}
{"text":"Stopped by last week.. first one in the door. I had fried chicken with greens/potatoes and buttered cabbage...I had a bowl of their creamy gravy on the side and dipped chicken pieces. The gravy went so well with everything that I ended up smothering everything. Came with freshly baked cornbread. 

Excellent meal.. Try the smothered pork chops.. or the Ox Tails. Lots of side dishes

It's simple to order, look at the mural on the wall. No checks, just tell the cashier what you had on the way out. 

Smothered chicken (two large pieces) cost $14. Entrees come with two sides and corn bread. Fast service. Mrs. White (in her 90s) still bakes pies for the restaurant... try the peach.

Her son, Lolo, has branched out and has three upscale restaurants scattered around the Valley: Lolo's Chicken and Waffles."}
{"text":"My first time visiting this establishment, and wow what a place. This place lives up to it's to it's reputation for soul food! I enjoyed the chicken fried steak, with a side of collar greens, corn bread, and a fresh glass of lemonade to wash it down. I noticed alot of writing on the walls from some famous people, and I enjoyed the overall spirit of this place. Taylor greeted my uncle and myself, and quickly helped us find a booth to sit at. Carlos brought our food to us, and I was highly impressed at his soft nature and beautiful attitude. I am sold on this great place, and will definitely make an effort to visit this awesome place, whenever I visit phoenix!! Kudos to the whole  Mrs. White' s team!!"}
{"text":"The Service from the waiters is below average ... they are not polite at all, they are nonchalant about issues patrons had with their food wait times... I even heard the waiter argue  with a table saying he's just the waiter and not the cook. the Mac n cheese is artificial and NOT homemade and looks and tastes identical to KFC Mac n cheese, it's Super yellow in color which would not be the case had it been homemade. I'm southern and the food is subpar. The yams were dry, the greens were ok there was no meat in them though ... the catfish was great though... And it was hot as hell in there...I know it's cooling down outside but the place is tiny and packed... I'm from the south so this place did not meet my expectations by far."}
{"text":"First time today for lunch. First class fried chicken. Best I've had for a long time. Mac and cheese and fried okra very good. Slaw was good but needed a bit more sugar and then it would have excellent. Like the touch of Kool Aide, nice on a hot day.

This place is uber casual. Service was very good and friendly. Will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"There's something about Mrs. White's that no other place has.  It's not something you can bottle up and sell.  It's the love they put into every meal.

I have to tell you... when a friend suggested we go to Mrs. White's yesterday when our plans were changed, I was ecstatic.  I had not been in quite awhile.  I could already imagine myself eating those green beans and potatoes, sweet potatoes and fried chicken.  

Once we got there, that is exactly what I ordered!  

I could tell, too, that my chicken was made with an extra side of love.  It was phenomenal.  

The people that don't like Mrs. White's don't get it.  I heard a lady complaining yesterday about how long her food was taking.  It kind of made me smirk.  Food this good is cooked to order... and takes time.  I knew it would be a long wait for our food, but I wasn't on a lunch hour.  I feel like anyone who is on a lunch hour might be better served hitting Mrs. White's another time.  

The people there are all great.  If you take the time to talk to the people who work there, you will see how nice they are.  We got to talk to \"Wink\" about how he got his nickname from his grandma in St. Louis.  I told him about how I got my nick name, too.  

I love Mrs. White's and I hope to visit again soon."}
{"text":"Wanted to eat here for a long time, was not disappointed. Large portions, great comfort food the way it is suppose to be. Shared the Moist Pork Chops, Fried Catfish, Fried Chicken. The sides are great also, cornbread, potato salad and mac & cheese and of course kool aid. We were fortunate there was no wait and also had parking available. The portions were very generous and actually made 2 1/2 meals. The staff was friendly and very helpful on deciding what to order. Can't wait to go back. You have to try this iconic place."}
