{"text":"Like everyone says, this place is great! Chicken smells and tastes so good! Friendly owner, takeout only with 2 park benches to sit in and wait for your order."}
{"text":"I'm salivating as I write this. I recently moved into the area, and found this place through Yelp. Got the whole grilled chicken (he recommended it over the rotisserie) and a large half potatoes half rice box. I will never be going back to Swiss chalet again. My order only came to a bit over $20, and was perfect for 4 people."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for over 4 years now but the quality has went down hill and the owner cooking the food doesn't care at all about how long his customers are waiting as he will continue to have long pointless conversations with other friends in the establishment for 20 minutes at a time. The last time I was here he literally gave me 6 potatoes and the chicken was so small it didnt even look like chicken.   On the plus side they have a pretty good sauce, but I will definitely be finding other Portuguese chicken places to go to instead as there are quite a few in the area.  BBQ Express on hwy 27 and Langstaff is way better."}
{"text":"This is a take out place, they dont have tables to sit and eat. However, the food is delicious! I love their chicken, rice and potatoes.  Their vegetables are great. The owner is really friendly! This is one of my favourite take out restaurants."}
{"text":"Very good place when you just do take out. But catered food is pathetic, got chicken from them for a party, the chicken was bone dry with no sauce. Ordered 3 of their signature pollo loco sauce, and when got home realized he gave us just 1 and the other 2 were just red hot. Disappointed especially with the support I've given him."}
{"text":"Alot better than nandos and many other places there. The potato balls could have a bit more seasoning but the chicken and rice is soooo good! It isnt cheap but it isnt crazy expensive.. so i love eating here when i can. I will travel from markham to maple just to have this chicken. Not kidding."}
{"text":"This is the best chicken in Vaughan.  I have tried many around town, however I still believe this recipe/cooking style is the best."}
{"text":"How have I ordered from this place dozens of times but yet to review it?  This is a great Portuguese chicken take-out joint. I usually get the 1/4 chicken combo that comes with potatoes and rice.... and their totally delicious, mouth watering, sauce. You need to get it spicy (or at least mildly spicy) for the full experience.  The rice is usually moist and tasty and same with the chicken and potatoes albeit a bit dry if they're not fresh. However, I keep coming back several times a month so I must not mind.  Is it weird that I'm salivating at 2:50AM thinking about this? Nah."}
{"text":"One word: AMAZING!  I never had such yummy food in my entire life, i just wish they would open a bigger place so people can dine in."}
{"text":"stumbled upon this place visiting Canada's wonderland, and we fell in love immediatly. we live downtown so it's a trek to get out there since we don't have a car. but anytime we are going in that direction we  stock up on chicken.  The sauce, the potatoes, the rice, and the moist chicken, all so good."}
{"text":"Attracted with the smell of the so many chicken on the grill.  This is a small store in a street mall.  If you don't know the place, it will be easily missed as it is hidden in the corner.  It is a take-out place and there is no table available.  The people there is nice.  Don't know how they can survive BBQ the whole day in front of the grill.  You can order mild, medium or spicy.  I dare only to try mild.  The chicken is wholly BBQ, then cut into quarters.  Those not yet ready will be thrown back into the BBQ pitch.  When every piece is ready, they will be put into a stir bowl to mix with the sauce and oil.  The chicken is then packed into foam boxes.  Yes, foam boxes.  I think the box deforms a bit with the hot chicken.  Next time I probably will bring my own container (but I forgot every time).  The chicken is very oily but tastes good.   Not for anyone that cannot eat lots of oil.  The potatoes are awesome.  There are times that potatoes are sold out and substitute with more rice.  The Saffron long grained rice smells really good.  It closes at 7pm.  So pick your meal up before dinner time."}
{"text":"It's an alright choice but found the rice mush, think uncle bens, and the chicken dry (ordered white meat) they slathered sauce on top of the chicken and the rice for taste, but it couldn't hide the fact it wasn't very good.   I did like the potatoes which were not too salty and cooked properly.   It's a popular place for the high schoolers to hit up for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to for lunch and dinner take out - quick, simple, Delicious!! I always get the whole chicken with loco sauce. Just absolutely delicious and tasty! Sometimes I feel like the chicken is small but for the most part taste makes up for it. Glad this place is close by!"}
{"text":"The chicken was pretty good, even the chicken breast was packed with flavour. I bought a 1/2 chicken combo the first time then went back just two days after to get a whole chicken. The price is very reasonably and the owner is friendly too, I would recommend this place to my friends too."}
{"text":"Best chicken in town by far, good empanadas as well. Try the chorizo empanada, amazing. Ask for the loco sauce for your chicken, it's a mix of hot sauce and chimichuri sauce, it gives the chicken a great flavour. This place isn't Portuguese, its South American, same idea though. Take out only"}
{"text":"Great Portuguese chicken! Friendly owner. Take out only and probably a good idea to call ahead. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"This is a take-out place and there are no tables. The food is great (Way better than Nando's). If you live in the area (or have to drive by it to get home) this is a great place to stop by and pick up dinner for the family.  We got the 1/2 chicken combo with potatoes and rice ($10) with both sauces. The chicken was juicy and tender (albeit quite oily) and the little potato balls were great. We also had a beef empanada ($3), which wasn't as good as the chicken.  They do paellas on the weekends, but they run out early. They also have soups (lentils and pork was the soup of the day when we visited)."}
{"text":"Love this place, it is by far the best chicken in the entire city. We drive from Thornhill  to pickup and its worth it.  Prices are very reasonable, chicken has a great flavor and is always moist. The owner is friendly and appreciates business. Well worth it, place is small and hard to find but worth the effort to find it. We like the chicken grilled with loco sauce, rice and potatoes."}
{"text":"I'd rate this place 4.5 stars! Super great grilled chicken!  Food: I purchased the 1/2 chicken combo with rice and potatos! OH MY LORD WAS IT YUMMY! The chicken was a great crispy char and super juicy with bursting flavors. Very authentic flavors, not overly salted or anything. Their rice is great, not mushy and I absolutely love their potatoes. They're actually CRISPY AND BROWN, not just boiled and drenched in a red sauce. Their green sauce is soo good, not sure exactly what is was but it complimented the chicken, rice and potatoes beautifully. The prices are pretty affordable too! The only thing is portions are a bit small (maybe because I love a lot of food) but once I'm finished, I'm disappointed because I wanted more and didn't want the food to end ahaha.   Service: Great service. Greeted by a guy at the front who was cooking and on cash, he made sure to change gloves and everything. He asked and made sure I knew what I was getting and if I wanted sauce or anything like that. Super nice guy. I recommend this for some great grilled chicken that is quite affordable!"}
{"text":"I use to come here a lot when I was in high school, then moved away and recently moved back to Maple, and after 10 years, the food here is still great! The chicken is always fresh and tasty. The service is great...the owner/ manager is extremely nice and friendly. He knows how to provide excellent customer service , so that customers always come back! That's how you run a business! Awesome food and excellent service..it's just too bad they close early 7 - 8pm closing time every day."}
{"text":"Picked up some Portuguese-style chicken to go the other day! So this is pretty much just a take-out restaurant. There were no tables inside. I came in an afternoon during a weekday and the line was not long at all. The chicken was delicious. Probably the best one in Vaughan so far. The sauce was just right. I did ask for medium hot sauce but it wasn't spicy at all. I'm gonna have to come back and try it! I will return!"}
{"text":"Nice little take out place. Good food and prices. Got the 1/4 white meat chicken combo. Will definately be back."}
{"text":"Chicken wasn't very flavourful and the grease seeped out of the take-out bag and onto my car seat. There was just so much of it."}
{"text":"This place might look like a hole in the wall, but the food is second to none. Eat here you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt one of my favourite lunch take-out spots.  It's a tiny take-out Churasqueria place where once inside you can see a bit of charming decor but what's more is the smell of the bbq flying out the door when you enter.  OMG, the smoke surrounds you as if you become one with the bbq.  The menu is small but what they do have on the menu, they do quite well even though I haven't had a chance to try all the items yet because I'm ADDICTED to the Quarter Chicken meal (Chicken Leg, Saffron Rice, and Potato) for roughly $6.00-7.00.  I LOVE their spicy sauce, so when they ask if you want spicy, say YES!  It would soak into the rice and turn it into something amazing you would lick every last drip.  From time to time, I will get their Daily Special item such as Jambalaya which was priced around $7.00-8.00.  This is the place I first tried an Empanada, which is not a bad snack for the price ($3.00 or so) but then I can eat lots at times.  They are not open Mondays and sometimes that's how I disappoint myself when I don't realize it when I go.  It is right across from Canada's Wonderland for some that wish to take a trip north of Toronto.  The owner wearing glasses will be there most of the time and is quite friendly... Always asking me, 'What would it be today, boss?'"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Half chicken with chimichurri sauce, rice and potatoes filled me up! So good we Had this for lunch and might need to have it for dinner before we head back home."}
{"text":"The chicken was decent. 3/5  Piri piri or whatever it was, was very oily and not my preference.   I am sure there are some who may prefer it that way but Id prefer franks red hot over what I was given.  The olive oil type sauce was tastier but when I look for Portuguese chicken I am looking for hot piri piri not Mediterranean style olive oil infused chicken.  Great staff and I do suggest at least trying it out to see if it fits your pallate,"}
{"text":"This is my goto place for Portuguese style barbecued chicken but this chef is spanish. So what he makes is a south american styled chicken which is just barbecued chicken  I always get two chickens and one with chimichuri sauce and the other with loco hot sauce  He also does a juicy rotisserie chicken as well  The sit down space is limited and usually every evening there could be a line up for dinner.  This is a popular spot for the Wonderland Park crowd to come grab food and have a rustic picnic on the grassy knolls.  Empanadas are thick and full of good stuff to add to your meal along with the Parisian potatoes.  Its a chicken place so no wifi  use your data plan while waiting for your order.  I have no idea if he is open for lunch as i have always come here for take out dinner"}
{"text":"Very good... very tasty... both the chimichurri and hot versions were delicious. The service was friendly the prices aren't bad.  Great for catering."}
{"text":"I used to go here years ago when the chicken was edible and has some flavour. Now it's dry as hell and tastes like cardboard. The rice is the only thing I enjoyed. Owner needs to buy bigger chickens and hire a chef to cook not over cook chicken while he's yapping to customers.   I'll go back to Costa Verde."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since 2003. My go to Portuguese chicken spot, they have the best sauce, fresh chicken with potatoes and rice. I've tried so many different places and they can't even compare. If you are going to order whole chickens you're going have to wait he does it by order and not by leaving it out to dry on the grill so it's always fresh. Don't know how people gave 3 stars."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on Jane St in the same strip mall as Katrina's Greek Restaurant. It is not a large place...it's probably the size of a small convenience store, so you really have to look for it.   I prefer my chicken extra spicy, and while the chicken is not cooked that way, sauce is provided to take it up a notch or two. I always get a whole chicken, quartered, potatoes, rice, veggies and more of that delicious chimichuri sauce.  They are a tad more pricier than other Portuguese chicken joints, but if you like all in all it's not a bad little place.  No place to sit inside...it is only a take away place.  Helpful Hint: Call in and pre-order your food....didn't one time and the wait was ridiculous."}
{"text":"First time trying it out and didn't have high expectations. When I left the shop I told the owner this and he said \"Oh you'll be back\". The man was right! The chicken is very tender and has a really nice grill taste to it. The potatoes are what you would expect from a potato but the rice is superb. I got the half chicken combo with spicy sauce (around $12 all in) and it's a winner in my books. Will and have go back again."}
{"text":"We drove up here to try some Portuguese style grilled chicken! :9 The store is in the Norwood plaza just across from Canada's Wonderland, and it's right beside the Becker's. The place was small and smelled so yummy. We ordered the whole chicken grilled ($12.95) and a large box of potatoes and saffron rice split ($7.25). There were some benches to sit while they made our order. It was packed up neatly in two styrofoam containers and tied up really well in a plastic takeaway bag. On our drive back I noticed the sauce was escaping out of the box, luckily it was in a bag. Best to have someone hold onto this securely on the drive back. The chicken was really good. I think the sauce (we got medium spiciness) is what makes the chicken so good. The chicken itself is more on the bland side, but it's perfect when dipped or covered in their tangy slightly spicy sauce. Love the sauce it came with.  I was not too much a fan of their saffron rice. It was over seasoned with salt in my opinion. Overall though, very good value at $22.85 (taxes all in) for a family of 4. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch all the time, and I love it. The food is excellent, and they have a deal for students."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Tucked away in a strip plaza, this small takeout place delivers on flavour and the guys working there are great.  The restaurant is a bit rough around the edges but I think they prefer to let their food speak for itself. We ordered the grilled chicken (we wanted the rotisserie but they were all out), a large box of rice and a medium container of their loco sauce. The chicken was delicious and juicy, the rice was also really flavourful and that sauce just made my day.  The loco sauce is a mix of their chimichurri sauce and their hot sauce and it's really delicious, priced a bit steep at $0.25 per ounce, it's worth every penny. I recommend getting the 12oz for $5, we were almost drinking the stuff.   This is a takeout spot so service isn't quite as important, but the guys working there made us feel like regulars even though tonight was our first visit. You can tell they're proud of the food and have many loyal regulars.   I probably won't be going back to our regular Portuguese chicken spot, red rooster after finding this place! Prices are better, food is better and I like supporting these smaller businesses!   Can't wait to go back to try the rotisserie chicken, hopefully they have it next time I'm around!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS BOMB. The chicken is absolutely delicious, moist and flavourful. They toss the chicken in a bowl of freshly made sauce in front of you. The portions are very generous especially for what you pay. I have to say, it is a bit greasy, but worth clogging an organ for! The medium spice was perfect. It added a little kick to it, but not to the point where you are looking to drink a glass of milk. Highly recommended if you are ever in the area!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here one day for lunch and I was blown away. It may seem like a little restaurant hidden away in a plaza, it's like hidden treasure. The quarter chicken with potato and rice with the sauce is out of this world. Whenever I go to Canada's Wonderland we always leave to pick up lunch here. I would totally recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Sim! Sim! (Yes! Yes!)  Eu amo grelhado frango! (I love grilled chicken!)  Eu amo quente molho! (I love hot sauce)  Pollo Loco Churasqueria really serves up nice tender chicken. My extra spicy request was fullfilled when my chicken was drowned in this orange, hot sauce.. remind me of Todasco sauce but not as sour tasting! Yes, I ask for spicy!  This is really a takeout spots so we ended up eating in the car. The 1/4 combo that nice man gave me is more like a 1/2 combo?? Maybe he feels sorry for me for my poor attempt of speaking in Portuguese!"}
{"text":"Unlike the usual breakdown of my reasons for giving a five star review, I'm just going to go out on a limb and say that this place just deserves it.   After ordering a whole rotisserie chicken, the person taking my order politely asked if I wanted anything else to which I said that I didn't. After my order was placed, she noticed me staring at the wall specials and getting really excited when I saw there was paella. She asked if I wanted to see it and of course I said that I did. It just looked soooooo good!   Moving on to the chicken, this place is a grab and go kinda joint. No eating in.   They sauce their chicken after cutting it in some magical mix and then sell extra sauce for .25 cents.   After getting home and opening up the food, I came to the realization that this place has, by far, THE BEST Portuguese chicken I have ever had in the GTA. It was so flavourful and tender. I'm absolutely putting this place down in the 'worth the drive to....' list!   I'm really looking forward to trying their paella (made on the weekends only)"}
