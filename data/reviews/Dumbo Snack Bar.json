{"text":"Cozy place, friendly cool atmosphere, and the most delicious snacks!!! Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"It was late, I was hungry and thankfully my friend lives across the street from this place! We ordered the deconstructed Caesar stack, Brussels sprouts, Pollo Slider and chocolate chip cookies. My mouth was satisfied, more importantly my hunger. The only thing I wasn't too keen on were the cookies. Otherwise the owners are super friendly, and the atmosphere is cozy, simple and the artwork adds a nice touch!  Thank you for being open until 2am! Def check this place out if you're in the area and want some food but tapas style plates!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Great atmosphere, cool vibe. Had the Dumbo sandwich, tasted amazing. Cool photo booth downstairs. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The satisfaction of waltzing into a place on Saturday night and getting seats right away...  The drinks-from-a-teapot model was cute and the drinks delicious. We tried and liked Photobomb.  Food wise, the Dumbo was rich and well done. The chicken slider, Suprema de Pollo slider, came in a close second. Reminded me of a McChicken.   Loved the portion sizes as my partner and I were deliberately trying not to stuff ourselves."}
