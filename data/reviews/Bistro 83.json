{"text":"Great atmosphere and food.. The wait staff was well versed on the menu and wine selection"}
{"text":"Probably not going back to this restaurant. My friend and I went there for lunch a few days ago. We placed our order around 11:50 and informed the waiter that we had an appointment so we needed to be out of there by 12:50. An hour seemed to be a reasonable time for a simple lunch order in a location that was not very busy.  The customers that came into the patio after we did were starting to get their orders and we were still waiting for our soup. When it did arrive after waiting 30 minutes our soup was cold and we had to send it back. The waiter was not happy about this. He was more concerned about the table of 8 that was wedged next to our table and every time he dropped off their food, he bumped into my arm and never apologized or suggested that they move their table. We finally got our lunch - a salad and a flatbread- around 11:50 but unfortunate we had to inhale it and take most of it to go since we had to leave.  Very poor service (waiter needs retraining on  how to treat customers) , lack of attention to condition and quality of food sent out of the kitchen. First time at the Bistro83 and most likely will be the last!"}
{"text":"Been a few times and the meal is always spot on. Staff is great and you feel you got more quality than the bill at the end of your meal. Atmosphere is also really cool. Very unassuming location and with the stop."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Bistro 83 about 8 times since they opened. The place is beautiful inside with a really nice patio. I can vouch for how great the food is because we have eaten most things on the menu. Bistro 83 is a welcome addition to the area and is unlike anything else. Now that the they have been open for a few weeks, the service bugs should be worked out. I have NEVER had Anything but amazing food at the bistro. Happy hour 3-6 Every day with food and drink specials is another great thing they have going for them"}
{"text":"What a crummy experience we had today for lunch at Bistro 83.  We were only the 2nd twosome on the patio when we sat down at 11:50am. Our server Trent didn't even identify himself when he first came over. We both ordered the soup of the day (French Onion) and I the Chefs Flatbread.  Five minutes later a business table of 8 came in behind us. It took us 30 minutes to get our soups which the cheese wasn't even melted (it was torched to look brown) and it was cold. We both sent our soups back to get warmed up and cheese melted. It was another 20 minutes before we for our entries that we couldn't eat because we had to get out of there for a meeting. All the while the 8 people behind us had their appetizers, chips and salads served. I guess the 8 top was of more importance to him to us. Poor service!!!!!  Poor time to get food out. Not happy at all."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time tonight and it was very good. Our waitress was knowledgeable and able to make good recommendations. I had a pear martini and cucumber cocktail, both were excellent. For dinner we shared calamari and then I had the pork volcano and my husband had the ravioli. We both really enjoyed all of the dishes. I do wish the calamari had some type of dipping sauce though, it was flavorful but I like a good sauce with that type of dish. We had maple crime brûlée for dessert which was amazing. I gave it 4 stars because I've had better of each of those dishes at other places but it was consistently good enough throughout the meal that we would definitely go back. They have a nice happy hour here too."}
{"text":"Great find in a \"sea\" of mediocre dining choices! Probably one of the most sophisticated spots in the area. The mezze platter of hummus and tzatziki with pita triangles and fresh assorted veggies was an ample serving for two. Lots of choices for gluten-sensitive palates and vegans too. I enjoyed the snapper on quinoa with a mango salsa. Main room seating includes window-side high-top tables, bar seating, and rather large banquettes. We sat outside on their covered patio and enjoyed the late-August warmth and sunset."}
{"text":"Most disappointing. After slip sliding (due to plastic wood like floors) to our table in a back room, the friendly server delivered wine, cocktail and dinner menu. Mark ordered a cocktail and I ordered the driest bubbly. Which arrived in a wine glass! Only to be told the bubbly is purchased in single serve bottles so as not to waste. Really? On to the app of crab cake stuffed artichokes. Deep fried inside and out. Not very tasty. Mark ordered paapardelle with mushrooms, arugula and salmon. Tons of mushrooms. One note flavor. Pasta and salmon nicely cooked. Mac and cheese - yuk! Globs of cheese, boring . Good service didn't make up for slippery floors, bad bubbly and mediocre food. We won't return."}
{"text":"First off, the staff is amazing. Our waitress was awesome and extremely knowledgeable about wine, beer and food. She alone deserves 5 stars.  The food on the other had was very average. I had a vegetarian sandwich, which was plain and  boring. The marinated seared tofu (a supposed highlight in the dish) was bland and left a lot to be desired.   The others in our group purchased the scallops, due to so many people raving about them. The consensus in the group was that the dish was average and over hyped.   None of the people in our group said they would be excited about coming back.   It is a shame since their staff is amazing."}
{"text":"Short version: excellent! Will come back.  Not so short version: My wife and I moved here about a year ago and never tried this place until now. Everything we ordered came out perfect and was super good. And everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their food as well. We could not help but look at other people's plates and they look very nice. Now I want to come back!"}
{"text":"Flatbread pizzas are delicious! The wine list is great. :) we have sat outside twice and loved it. It is nice to have a wine bar so close to home!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!! Don't let the location fool you this place is top notch. Been there a bunch and we'll definitely going back for more!  The service was quick, professional and made for a great night out.  The food was out of this world, the chef there created and maintains an excellent menu, I haven't had one thing that wasn't excellent yet.  Great wine, beer and liquor selection with some very nice high end liquors.  Couldn't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Knowledgeable and accommodating for those with gluten sensitivity! We had a great meal and will return."}
{"text":"Just had the grilled tuna at Bistro 83. The tuna was prepared perfectly, grilled and seared with a medium to rare finish. One of the best pieces of fish ever!"}
{"text":"First time at Bistro 83 for me last night. Dined with 5 others that had been there before. They had raved about it to me and I now know why. A very pleasant dining experience. Our server Laura was outstanding and she had served my friends before. Food was very good and properly seasoned with a very nice presentation. Apps were 4 cheese flatbread with a lovely drizzle of honey. Figs on Horseback also tasty and recommended. For entrees we ordered scallops, pierogies stuffed with butternut squash, the Bistro steak and a burger on a pretzel bun. Every dish was very good and all of us were very happy with our choices. For dessert we were offered a choice of three beautiful cheesecakes. I chose the key lime cheesecake and it was delicious. Laura was attentive to our needs and our wine glasses were always topped off. I would return again for the excellent service and for the opportunity to try different menu items."}
{"text":"We love this place . The food is good and the atmosphere is great . The pork chop is my favorite . They always have new specials and the servers are knowledgeable ."}
{"text":"After hearing about the exceptional quality of the food and service for so long we decided to try Bistro 83 for our 27th Anniversary. What a wonderful experience!   The space was ample yet intimate and warm. Woodsy colors, leather, brick fireplace, accompanied by unique displays of wine screws and specialty taps displayed in attractive collections. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the expansive libation and gastronomical offerings. It happened to be National Beer Day so everyone was treated to a beer sample which was accompanied by a mass tutorial on how to pour and appreciate the complexities of beer. When the bartender asked if there was a special occasion in the house my Husband revealed our Anniversary. A wonderful toast was made and the entire restaurant wished us well.   The pour of my Husband's Guinness would bring a smile to any Irishman and my glass of  Custard Chardonnay refreshing. We each enjoyed pairs of cold water lobster tails that were perfect in both texture and sweetness. My Husband enjoyed perch tacos that were lightly breaded and sauced in a way that enhanced the flavor of the fish versus detracting, which is so common these days. The half-size side salad easily fed two. The texture of the spring lettuce both crisp and flavorful. Bread accompanied the meal with a dip oil that hid a surprising but appreciated hint of fire.    At the end of our meal we were beautifully presented with a chocolate molten lava under glass. The moist semi-sweet cake was accompanied by an Anniversary card signed by every member of the staff. We had hoped for a special evening and Bistro 83 certainly delivered."}
{"text":"Made reservations on Valentine's Day and was seated after a couple who hadn't made a reservation.   The couple who didn't have the reservation got a table inside, and we were seated on an enclosed patio!   We stayed there because we felt bad for the server in that patio section who kept losing tables because everyone else who was seated out there either left or complained and moved inside.   The food wasn't bad, but the whole experience was pretty much ruined by being thrown on the patio after going to the trouble of making reservations for the holiday."}
{"text":"Pros:  Nice decor, easy to get a table, fantastic pretzel rolls Cons:  Very slow service:  Waitress said she \"didn't want to interrupt our conversation,\" so we waited for 20+ minutes for her to take our order.   Food was good for the price, but not amazing.  We'll probably go back because of the location, but if I had to drive a distance, I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We had the tuna and scallops for our entrées and they were spectacular. For an appetizer we highly recommend the figs. Great customer service and friendly people."}
{"text":"This restaurant far exceeded my expectations. The service was near perfect and the food was fantastic. The Reuben pierogies were so delicious. The flatbreads and mac&cheese were also very good. I'll be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Love this little gem of a bistro! Beautiful restaurant, always delicious food and drinks, friendly, professional service. Very clean and full of beauty and class. A special spot and I'm so glad we found it. Keep up the great work. Highly recommend Bistro 83!"}
{"text":"I called Bistro 83 to book a reservation for a last minute going away party. They set up a private room and offered to have wine waiting for us etc. They went above and beyond with service!   The food is very good also and a very unique beer list. The patio is great and they have a fire to sit by as well.   My only downside for Bistro 83 is that it can be pricey. There is a happy hour, which would be a great time to try it out."}
{"text":"This was my second visit here, and it was just as good the second time around. Well stocked liquor and wine selection including tequilas I am quite fond of. We had a party of three people. started out with pretzel and  fried green tomato caprese. Both delicious.    I don't remember the exact names for meals, but it boiled down to the cedar planked salmon, and two orders of red pepper ravioli (1 minus sausage). all amazing dishes. The staff is extremely friendly, and knowledgeable in anything we asked of them. I sat at the bar the first visit, high top second visit, and was comfortable at both, and the ambiance is quiet and nothing too crazy. My only problem are the hours, but I tend to be a late eater, so it probably only affects me..    I would certainly recommend this place to anyone. I noticed bad reviews in the early days of opening, and almost went somewhere else, but I think whatever glitches they had are long gone."}
{"text":"This place is OK, A-OK per my rating. It is not horrible, but I am not impressed either.I came here with a friend that lives in North Ridgeville. This is somewhere she has always wanted to visit. So she made us reservations for 3:30 as it was a Friday night and she thought it would be full. It was not there were only 2 other couples in the whole place. Granted it was 4:00pm early in the night to come. Well we stood and waited by the Hostess stand for about 3 min. A few of the workers looked at us, but no one said anything. Finally a young girl came up and said, can I help you?? Well yes, this is a restaurant no, what do you think we are here for.( That was going through my mind) My friend however said, yes I made a reservation for 4. The girl looked very confused and needed to go to get help with that big request. It is OK we said ,we will sit at the bar. We did sit at the Bar and told the Bar tender we would eat there,as they had Happy Hour food. All a pretty good price. Lobster tails for $9.00, Veg. plate for $5.00, etc. It took a very long time to get anything here. Food took forever, and we wanted a long time to get each drink that we ordered. Not complicated drinks either. I was drinking Red Wine and my was drinking Cosmos, and then I think she switched to a Martini. One of the other couples at the bar was someone that worked there and her Male companion and then there were 2 other women at the other far end of the bar. As we sat there for a while a few other people came in to be seated. They too were greeted with the same enthusiasm as we were. This is Friday night mind you. I would think the place would be packed. It was not. Maybe they pick up later in the night.  The food we got was all quite good. Although extremely salty. I mean , I was thirsty for days after visiting Bistro 83!  The service was good, just not great. The food was very good, but the Ducks wings were far too salty, way over salted. It is decorated quite nice, and it is very clean. So those are all good things. Plus you can eat outside when the weather is nice. It was far too hot and humid the day we were there.  Parking in the front. Nice clean rest rooms."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places, a true hidden gem. But, my past two visits have been less than great so it makes me sad to give this place 2 stars when it should have 4. I went here for my anniversary and was hoping to have a nice but chill meal. instead we sandwiched into a back area that was cramped because the table next to us was filled with larger drunk people who kept hitting us with their chairs and kicking our legs when trying to get out of the chair. I also have an allergy to seafood, which is normally not a problem, but this entire table of 5 had seafood appetizers and seafood meals. It smelled disgusting and even my husband who doesn't have an allergy was ready to get the hell out.   We were halfway done with our meal but I asked him to get boxes and to meet me outside by the car. We have planned on getting dessert because their cheesecake is awesome, but I just wanted to leave.   I figured this was just a fluke, but it was still so off putting. We decided to go back for my birthday, which was about 3 months later. Well, that trip was on a Tuesday night and it was also disappointing. The family next to us had four children, I am not good with estimating ages but two of them were too little to wander around and the other two were mobile. These children were screaming and crying and the mobile ones kept running into me and the one even tried to dig through my purse, twice. This is not acceptable behavior and this is not the type of place that is family friendly. I used to love this place because it was a laid back atmosphere with high quality food and good value. But, the other guest are ruining that experience so I guess it's back to the search to find a new place."}
{"text":"The employees were nice, and the food was very good.  We had a 5:00 pm reservation which we were seated once we arrived.  However, once we were seated the hostess comes up to our table and tells us that they overbooked and will need the table at 7:00 pm.  So basically, they are telling us that they will toss us out at 7pm if we are still there.  Now mind you we had no intention of staying there for two hours but that is the first time I was ever told that I had to leave by a certain time.  It's not my problem they overbooked and I found it tacky for them to tell us this."}
{"text":"I've been here three times in two years while visiting the area, but I will not return. The first two times were for lunch. The last time was this past Friday for dinner. Each time the service was very slow. The entire staff seems unhappy; not a single smile from anyone: neither the host, manager, server, or the very grumpy lady who walked around filling water. This last visit we were greeted by a hostess who told us they had no tables available and we would have to wait. We pointed out the three empty booths and were then seated. I'm not sure what that was about. But we were then made to wait about 20 minutes for drink orders to be taken. The server didn't seem interested in serving anything. We had to ask for an appetizer that never came although the server did apologize and made an effort to make up for it. The food here is very good, but the general demeanor of everyone involved in its operation each of the three times has made the visits unenjoyable and for that reason I won't return. I don't require over-the-top service, but when you're made to feel like your business and presence is unwanted and unappreciated then I can not justify giving further consideration when there are plenty of other options in the area. Other reviews give high praise of the service so I guess it's a matter of when you visit. Unfortunately, my experiences were all negative. If you happen to get good service then you'll probably like this place."}
{"text":"I recently dined at Bistro 83 for lunch as my mom wanted to go here for her birthday. It's not located immediately off the highway, but isn't difficult to find. It's located in a small shopping center/development.   It's a nice place. Classy looking interior. The building/space looks newly built. Attractive bar with 15 seats or so. Restaurant seating is several very large booths and a decent number of tables.   Service throughout our meal was great. Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable, professional and patient. The people with me were slightly difficult customers. I won't go into details because I would be disowned, but the waiter was really great. There were a few items that we didn't like and they were taken off the bill without any of us asking for the same.   I'll avoid listing every item we ordered and just hit the notable parts:   We ordered the langostino mac and cheese. None of us liked it. It was bitter somehow and not enjoyable in the least.   I had a quattro formaggio flat bread and I would do some dirty things to eat that again (or just go again and pay for it like a normal person, i guess). It was perfectly cooked and was drizzled with honey which made my mouth sing. The cheese itself was not overwhelming, which is important on an item such as this.  The menu description reads: cream sauce, brie, parmesan, local goat cheese, mozzarella, chives, and honey. It worked. It worked really well. We all agreed it was the best thing that arrived on our table.   I think the prices are a little high. $10 to $14 is the cost for a flat bread. $15 for a mac and cheese \"small plate\" appetizer.   Conclusion: I'd go again despite our relatively inconsistent lunch. It could have just been a bad day in the Bistro 83 kitchen. If I can con someone into driving me, I'd love to go to one of their wine tastings. I see online that they have a room just for wine tasting.  Bonus points: on Bistro 83's menu online, they show pictures of almost every item."}
{"text":"We are blown away! Can we give this place 6 stars?! We stopped in randomly and we're overly impressed from start to finish.   Decor: Intimate bistro with ambiance lighting  Service: EXCEPTIONAL! Candess was our server and she was delightful. A credit to the restaurant!!  Food: The menu is diverse and extensive. We chose the Bacon Wrapped Dates, Bistro Side Salad, Pork Shank and Lava Cake. Everything came out super speedy, piping hot and BEAUTIFULLY presented. See the pics! (And that doesn't even do the dishes justice). Wow wow!  Overall fantastic. Can't WAIT for an excuse to come back to here. If only we didn't live 300 miles away :/"}
{"text":"New favorite place!!! Service was top notch! Calamari was great! I had the salmon and my husband had the pork volcano! We both loved our meal and the other meal! The drink menus were overwhelming with choices! We had dessert which was also fantastic! We will be back!"}
{"text":"An excellent first experience at this restaurant. Greeted by a gracious host who seated us in the Wine Room. It doubles as a private room for large parties but it was much quieter than the Friday night noise level in the front. I will ask for it again. Our server (Laura) was prompt and professional throughout the meal.  When asked, she suggested the Pork Volcano which was tender, flavorful and worth going back for! Extensive wine & craft beer selection as well (I enjoyed the Bell's Two Hearted Ale). Portion sizes are reasonable ... they strive for quality and not quantity. A very enjoyable meal at a restaurant I plan to add to my favorites list."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem in Ridgeville. Fantastic happy hour specials and the food is on par with any restaurant in the greater Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the service we received.  The lobster is fantastic and so is the Calamari. I had the salmon as a main course and it was out of this world.  I would give more than five stars if I could. I live a few hours away or I would frequent this place all the time. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We walked into Bistro 83 on a Saturday night without reservations. The staff managed to fit us in and was surprisingly accommodating for a busy night. I would have to say Bistro 83 is well ahead of peer restaurants in this aspect. The staff was also quite attentive and all were very friendly. The atmosphere is dimmed but not too dark.  We ordered the olives and wanton tacos. The olives were amazing. Served in a martini glass and slightly warmed which gave them a buttery texture. The wanton tacos were very good as well. I wouldn't have expected BBQ pork mixed with blue cheese and wantons to fit in this place, but they were good. As a note however, we ordered two drinks when we first arrived. I had a bottled beer while my wife had a glass of wine. For some reason, the appetizers made it to the table before our drinks. Not that this was bad or good, just strange.  For our main dishes I had the pigs in a blanket and my wife had a pasta dish. The pigs in a blanket were ok. The pork was a little dry and the risotto though good was undercooked. It is actually the first time I have had risotto where the rice was still uncooked in the middle. It was still good though for taste and I finished my plate. My wife's dish actually was pretty poor for the price. It actually tasted like somebody opened a can of spaghetti o's and poured onto the plate, then charged almost $20.   We didn't do dessert because everything on this night was cheesecake and my wife doesn't like cheesecake. However what they offered sounded good. Overall it wasn't our favorite place and we wouldn't go out of our way to stop by, but we would come back if the mood was right. It is a nice addition to the North Ridgeville area with a serious lack of nice places to eat. Compared to many of the restaurants in the Cleveland area however I feel the three stars is appropriate. If there were three and half we would land there.  I would encourage anyone to stop by and try the place out. As I said, not quite what we expected, but worth a try."}
{"text":"We rented the private wine tasting room for a special occasion dinner and were so very pleased!! They set up a special prix fixe menu for our group that was really delicious! People raved about their dinner, presentation was beautiful and service was truly on point!! Can't wait to come back and try more of their food."}
{"text":"Visted last night with my wife. We sat on the patio which was very nice. They had a nice fireplace. The inside attire was very nice though I didn't get a long look at it.   The beer list is quite good. As a craft beer fan they do a very good job with the selection. I'm hoping for a good rotation.  I had the burger and my wife had a flatbread. We both thought our entrees were very good. My only complaint was with the chips that came with the burger. These could have been Lays as far as I know. They surely were not house made and were quite small. We got the soft pretzels as an appetizer. Very good. On top of this bread was served to the table. I have no idea how that butter was made but it was stellar. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, presentation was on point.  Flavorful with many colors and textures.  The dessert was out of this world.  S'mores  Crème brûlée was to die for.  The orange Creamsicle cheesecake was also so good.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now for Happy Hour on Saturdays.  Amazingly delicious food and drinks.  Great service. We love it here!"}
{"text":"Had the cod sandwich lunch special.  The sandwich looked much like a 'frozen' Gortons cod fish. Service was also not good.  Waitress never returned to my table to ask if I wanted another beverage or ask how the food was.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The location is the only reason I could imagine this place receiving a positive review, convenience for those living within walking distance.  I have tried multiple dishes on many visits and my experience is consistently bad.  The food is so underwhelming I felt obligated to write this review.  Do yourself a favor and avoid."}
{"text":"A most excellent happy hour menu. I'd recommend going anytime though.Great selection of cocktails and food. (The outside seating area looked nice too)"}
{"text":"Food is amazing grouper very needed more mango  Shrimp and pasta excellent Red pepper stuff ravioli amazing  Steak made perfect  Definitely will return"}
{"text":"My wife and i went here on a friday night and sat on the patio.  Our initial impressions were good.  Hostess was very friendly and inside decor was sheik.  We sat outside and ordered drinks and dinner.  Food was fair to good.  Only minor complaint was the server did not know the menu very well and was slow, although very nice.  We were going to order dessert, but she took so long to come around we changed our minds.    We will be back.  One minor feature outside I really liked was they have a TV located high up so you can view games if you want, but its not in your face if you have no interest and just want to chat."}
{"text":"I have always had a great time here! Service is a little slow, even on a slow night, but always earnest and polite. The food is amazing! The French pear martini is spot on as well. The chef definitely has his act together."}
{"text":"FINALLY!!!  It's nice to have a place in Ridgeville with a real grasp on food and beverage. Great beer selection, great food selection, great wine selection. They also do beer and wine tastings here. I have not been to one yet but hope too soon. Their prices are fair for what they serve. I only hope it's expensive enough to keep the drunk Ridgeville hillbillies and their Budweiser tall boy taste in the center ridge shit hole bars. The only criticism I would offer is don't be shy with the spices and flavor. A few things I have had there were a little under seasoned. If you season it, they will come. Not that you need my help, the place is full every time I go. Thanks and see you soon."}
{"text":"Awful  Slow. Rude. Noisy  We could not talk to each other without screaming.  Food was brought out separately so we ate one at a time rather than eat cold food together.  Hostess was a smart butt  The food was good as was the wine but offset by bad service and atmosphere.  Avoid at all cost"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a terrific meal here last evening. Warm olives appetizer was a terrific start the shake off the cold. The zesty balsamic bread dip and warm bread was fantastic too! A big thank you to our wait staff for their attentiveness and professionalism! Our server Megan was very knowledgeable about the cocktail and wine list and most expertly poured a Guiness with a perfect head of foam. We each asked for a variation on a menu item and the orders were brought quickly and exactly as we had requested. The Brussels Sprouts sauteed in bacon were delish!!!!  This was a 5 star experience at a beautiful and cozy Bistro!"}
{"text":"Nice place inside and friendly staff, but the food wasn't good and my poor dad got so sick from the mussels and fish we couldn't drive 30 minutes before we had to pull over. Would not recommend this place and definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! FABULOUS fine dining experience. Highly recommend for a special evening out."}
{"text":"We were surprised to find such a gem in North Ridgeville. We took a chance on it after passing it on the way to Avon. The food was excellent and they had a lovely wine list. They brought a free dessert for my husband's birthday as well. We look forward to going back and trying more of what their menu has to offer."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service. Nice atmosphere too.  This was my first time visiting this place. Based on the Yelp reviews, I decided to come and try this new place. It was a Saturday night and luckily that I called to make a reservation before. The restaurant was pretty busy with nice crow. The staffs were so friendly, attentive, and polite.  My bf and I ordered Irish chowder, Black Groupen, and Faroe Island Salmon. Everything was great. My least favorite was probably the Irish chowder though.   If you have never been this place and do not stay too far away, it is worth to visit this place. You will not be regret!"}
{"text":"There aren't too many places that manage to impress me anymore. It just seems as if there's a shortage of restaurants that want to do more than what's expected. I hate to tell them, but slapping the word \"gastropub\" on your menu isn't enough. Luckily, there are still a few eateries that go above and beyond, that take so much pride in what they do that it's practically dripping from the walls. Bistro 83 is just such a place.  The occasion for our visit was my birthday. My wife, once again, placed her trust in Yelp and found Bistro 83. Picked partly because of their unique menu and partly because she thought the beer geek in me would find something to be happy about. She was right on both counts.  As soon as we arrived we were immediately greeted by the hostess. The interior is small but comfortably so. For as cozy as it was it never really felt like we were being closed in upon. We took a seat at one of the tables by the front windows and immediately noticed a minor annoyance in the wall decorations. They are a bit bulky and stick out from the wall quite a bit. They are also hung at eye level by the tables making them a tad intrusive. Not a huge deal, just one of those things.  Our server was a delight. Friendly, prompt, knowledgeable and present in just the right amount. Our waters remained filled without prompting and she had several recommendations for both drinks and food. Not much more could have been asked for in this area. Speaking of drinks, it's worth noting that Bistro 83 definitely has a wine-y feel to it with the decor and expansive wine selection. Hell, the word wine's even in the name. That being said, if you're into beer you won't be disappointed. A well curated bottles list along with several fresh local brews on tap are close at hand. But the real star is the food.  I wasn't sure what to expect when we walked in. Would it be yet another average, overpriced experience that would leave us stuck in the meh zone? A quick look at the menu had us immediately thinking otherwise. Calamari, flatbreads, salads, charcuterie, large plates. This just might turn out well after all.  To get the meal started, the Bistro Salad with it's playful take on what has become the new American standard, was just right. Dried blueberries, candied pistachios, cheese from Ohio goats and ridiculously fresh-tasting mixed greens were happily bedrizzeld in the tart balsamic vinaigrette. I'm not really a salad guy, but I wouldn't kick this one outta bed.  Those of you that follow me know that I'm a bit of a soft pretzel snob. I get them whenever i can and I'm not one to mince words about how I feel about them. Bistro 83 does the soft pretzel right. Crispy, dark brown, salted cylinders of chewy pretzeline perfection. I apologize, when I'm inspired I often lean too heavily on the alliteration. But damn, these pretzels. The house-made Cotswold cheddar cheese dip was a delicious accompaniment.  The wonton tacos. You just have to get them. Trust me. It's like a pulled pork sandwich enveloped in a crispy, fried wonton wrapper. The cool, slightly sweet bleu cheese slaw, the twinge of heat in the pork. Between these and the pretzels I was blissfully gorging myself silly. But wait, there's more.  No longer on the menu (probably a seasonal selection) the double bone pork chop, smoked with Ohio bourbon barrel wood chips and grilled, was so good even a pig would eat it. The generous chop, wearing its grill marks like black badges of honor, came nestled upon a bed of buttery buttermilk mashed potatoes drizzled with a cherry bourbon glaze that brought a one-two punch of sweet and tart to the mix and tears of joy to my eyes. I did find the selection of grilled squash to be a bit sad, especially given the caliber of the overall dish. I personally find squash to be such a worthless creature that should be banned from all menus.  My wife had the smoked mozzarella red pepper ravioli and the constant grin on her face along with her noticeable silence told me she was pleased with her selection. Not normally one to get pasta during our meals out this was a dish that may have me rethinking my hesitance. The freshly-made pasty was cooked a perfect al dente and covered in diced Italian sausage and thick slices of woodsy wild mushrooms. A gentle lacing of balsamic cut through the rich, buttery-smooth sauce like a samurai sword and the subtle smokiness of the cheese filling added an understated nuance.  As far as birthday dinners go, this one was one that will linger in my memory for some time. The service we received was excellent, attention to detail was an evident ingredient in every dish we sampled and yes, Bistro 83 is in North Ridgeville. This is a restaurant that could be located in any of the most competitive culinary markets in the country and they'd fare quite well. Good thing for me, they're not. Now what special occasion can I make up to finagle another visit..."}
{"text":"Have been there several times. There are some seasonal menu items that change. What I like is the quality of food, service, and wines. The only down side for me are the TV. This place is terrific and TVs are a real distraction and lower the ambiance. That being said I ask to be seated outside when possible or as far from the TV. The most recent visit was with friends on Sweetest Day, but none of us knew it was Sweetest Day. We ordered food for sharing: braised beef tacos, mushroom flatbread and Caesar salad. Plenty of food for all. A couple of us got different salads. Consistently good food and great servers who have personality and skill."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a whim one day while out shopping.  I'm glad we did.  The atmosphere was nice, kind of dark inside, but clean and well laid out.  It's bigger than it looks from the outside.  I let our waitress recommend a local beer they had on tap and she was able to ask my personal beer tastes and recommend a beer based on that.  I always hate it when a shop advertises their great beer selection and the staff just grunts and points to the list with no real explanation, so props to Bistro 83 on knowing their stuff!  I recommend their \"Express Pick 3\" or Summer Chicken Sandwich.  Both came out quickly and were well presented on the plate.  Something else I also found out about after leaving is Bisto 83 offers fundraising opportunities for your organization.  Nice to see a local shop help give back to the local community."}
{"text":"Joined the family for my oldest sibs 80th birthday lunch.  The lenten special was our biggest choice. Deep fried Walleye with blue cheese cole slaw and the best potato fries ever!  And i added the $10 lobster tail happy hour special.  The walleye was perfectly prepared.  Followed by the chocolate coconut (and more) ice cream - out of this world.  Our waitress was so much fun. Polite. Efficient. Friendly. No one could ask anything more from a restaurant than extraordinary food and service in a great atmosphere. If you were a friend of mine you would know I am not one to give 5 stars to a subpar restaurant/service. Bistro earned my 5 Star!"}
{"text":"A neighborhood gem! I moved into the North Ridgeville area about a year ago and was just waiting for this restaurant to open. This area is starving for something along the lines of a more premium bar experience. And these guys nailed it.   Their draft selection was well thought out and their wine offerings seemed spot on. I had their version of a Manhattan and it was really good too. I would definitely recommend it and they have a version of a Moscow Mule that I was eyeing up.   We just had the appetizers and they were tasty. The steak medallions were good but I believe the meat was a little bit overcooked making it chewy. The barbarian pretzels were awesome though.   As far as entrées, we only had the flatbreads but they were really good. Sun-dried tomato chicken and margarita flatbreads were definitely some of the best. The mozzarella pieces on the Margherita pizza where large and really really tasty. I will definitely be coming back for their daily happy hour from 3 to 6."}
{"text":"Great food! We were driving from Chicago to Washington DC. In the middle of nowhere found this great place via Yelp. So happy because we were starving and tired so this restaurant made us  very happy. I had the Caribbean Mahi, kids had burgers, flat bread and husband pasta bolognese. Everything was delish!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Bistro 83 approximately six or seven times since they opened. We have thoroughly enjoyed our meal each and every time. The space is decorated nicely, the staff is always courteous and on point, I even asked the bartender if he knew how to make a special drink and he did not, but he looked it up and made it for me. The star of the restaurant is the food. The selection is broad. The quality is good and the plate looks great each and every time. Most importantly, the flavors are wonderful from beginning to end. I highly recommend the Figs On Horseback appetizer and the Scallops for dinner. The Pappardele Bolognese is also quite good. They are closed on Sunday's. Bistro 83 has a private room for private events. Since we live in North Ridgeville, Bistro 83 has become our go to place."}
{"text":"Jessica, Jeff, and Alec are the best. Top notch service. The food is amazing and the new bar is awesome!"}
{"text":"Flat bread was really good to share as a starter. The bistro steak was a great dish, although next time I will try it medium cooked. Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great atmosphere, the food is great, and it's very conveniently located in the neighborhood. I am a big fan!"}
{"text":"There are some very good things and some alright Things and some poorly executed things.  First off the restaurant brick and mortar is nice. Clean decorated well.  Most of the staff is good and knowledgeable.  The soup specials always contai n something great so try one of those.  The pork belly trifecta app is great. Must try.  The salads just ok. Some of the specials are really good.  Price point is high for the area but some items are worth it.  Would have been 4 stars but price point portions sizes need adjustments.  Price high portion small."}
{"text":"We made reservations here a week prior with friends and when we arrived we see a booth which we believed was ours, then overheard a table close to the door complain that every time the door opened they got a blast of cold air so manager moved them to the booth and put us at the cold table. We lasted 5 minutes and asked to be switched. The manager told us to go wait at the bar, it would probably be 20 minutes wait then.  We had to vacate table so he could give to another sap ( I mean customer) I assumed while we were waiting at the bar he would at least comp our drinks... NO. After 20 minutes we were seated on the outside patio which was covered in plastic and had portable heaters! It was warm, but furniture was uncomfortable heavy cast iron.  The previous time I visited I had mushroom flat bread which was good, this time I got chicken pesto flat bread ( which waitress recommended) Was only fair. Everyone else got the scallops and said they were good., but won't be back."}
{"text":"Nice place! Had the blackened grouper with red pepper polenta. Everything came out steaming and well arranged. We were short on time and were both able to enjoy a really good course in under an hour! Will definitely go back for full tour of the menu"}
{"text":"Food was fine. Service was pain fully slow. There were three servers for lunch with another group eating in. It took so long for drink orders and then even longer to be acknowledged for the check. Honestly we were stop disappointed in the service we won't be going back"}
{"text":"Service is above par and the food, although a little eclectic, has been amazing. Drink selection has variety and ingenuity. If you haven't been here, I highly recommend it. If you, by chance, had a bad experience... everyone deserves a second chance and I doubt you will regret it. Prices are a little up there, but come on it's not Applebees."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a bit of a surprise for the location. The atmosphere is lively and the food is good. I've been here a couple of times, mainly because the location is so convenient if you're coming from Avon.  They tend to get very busy in the evenings and on the weekends so I would recommend making a reservation. They have a large menu with a large variety of food options. Great spot for groups since everyone is bound to find something they will enjoy for food or drink.   I'd definitely recommend this to people in the area. It is by far the nicest option you'll find in North Ridgeville or the area in general."}
{"text":"Wow, elegant and innovative cuisine out in North Ridgeville! I had the \"Reuben pierogies\", and the pork belly and bean soup. I'm split between giving four or five stars here; I'll have to come back and see if I can bump it to five!"}
{"text":"I ate here on 9/8/13 during the dinner service.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated.  The restaurant was slow on this evening so we got very good service.   We ordered the cheesy flatbread with honey as an appetizer and I have to tell you that I was blown away by the explosion of favors in my mouth.  We then ordered the bistro salad which was great.  A tiny bit more dressing would have made it perfect.  The salmon was great as well.  Almost perfectly cooked. The dessert sampler was perfect for sharing.  The Lavender Martini was the only disappointment during our visit.  The drink had so much alcohol that I could barely drink it.  I was actually sick for two days:( I would still go back and visit but I'll probably stay away from the cocktails."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time last week and were very pleased! There was a small wait (less than 10 mins) so we had a drink at the bar. I tried the Lemon Cosmo and loved it!  Once we were seated we tried the Bavarian pretzels (very good!) and the figs on horseback (divine).  We shared the Hungarian pepper flatbread and the Bistro Bolognaise. Our portions were abundant and we'd give the food itself 4 1/2 stars if that was possible.  The service was spectacular and the interior very nice. We will definitely return! They've got a great thing going at Bistro 83."}
{"text":"Made a reservation after hearing a couple close friends say it was good. Reasonably priced and excellent food. Our server got tied up with a table cashing out with 8 credit cards so another server stepped in and helped out. I would recommend this place for a nice date night."}
{"text":"What more can I say about this establishment?   Perfection from the time of entry to the exit.   Started with Calamari which was hands down the best calamari I have had in any restaurant. Being a foodie, we frequent many places (no chain restaurants). This takes the cake.   Went with Steak Au Poirve. It was done to perfection! With mashed potatoes that also were some of the best.  Presentation, can't say enough.   Cocktail choices, again A+.  The dessert, Tiramisu.....WOW!!!!!!!  The most important thing we look at is service, as working in the customer service industry, service is everything and word travels if it is good or bad. We experienced top notch. The recommendations given to pairings all the way to the dessert. She had it spot on. Knew details of everything she talked about. Jordyn, you are a gem! A true asset to this beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"In the best Cleveland restaurants this food would be top notch. The only difference is the price. They have great service, great food and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for lunch just after 11am, to avoid the rush. We were one of three tables at first, but it still took over 15 minutes for our waiter to take our order. I ordered the BBQ flatbread, and my husband ordered an Italian sandwich. The food was absolutely delicious. After we finished eating we waited another 15 minutes or so for our waiter to come back with the check. I was only able to finish half of the flatbread, and our waiter said he would box up the rest for me. He came back after a bit to process our payment, without my leftovers. When he came back the final time with my receipt, he still didn't have my leftovers.... he forgot I wanted it boxed and threw it away!!! It was a $13 flatbread so $6.50 of our bill literally went right into the trash.  Our \"quick\" lunch stop ended up being over an hour, and the forgotten doggy bag left a bad taste in my mouth. Bistro 83, your food is spot on, but your service is lacking. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a early dinner every thing was awesome.  Jason our server was top notch! Food, service, atmosphere was great"}
{"text":"Meh, Bistro 83 was just okay. I misunderstood something I read and thought this was a small plates/ tapas kind of place.   It had a casual, mixed menu, but the atmosphere was pretty swanky. Our waiter was great, but that was the only part of the meal that really stood out. I ordered a panzanella salad, which he explained to me was a bread salad. Yes, I knew that. However, this salad came out and it was a little bit of iceberg lettuce topped with huge croutons. Not exactly a traditional panzanella.  I also ordered the wonton tacos and they were pretty good. Nice flavor. We were there in September and I honestly don't remember anything else we ordered, but neither of us were super impressed. Lots of other options to consider before going back there. It was also expensive."}
{"text":"The place is really loud, portions are small, and service slow.  There were a couple of times during the evening where we wondered what happened to our waitress?  15 min at a time and she wasn't on the floor.  We had to give our bill to another waitress to get out of there.  I'm giving it 2 stars to be generous.  We passed 6-8 really great restaurants to try this and left very unimpressed.  We won't be back.    We just found out that friends of ours were responsible for paying for our wine.  The waitress made it seem that the drinks were on the house because we requested to be moved away from the large rowdy table who was so loud, we couldn't hear ourselves think.  In light of this, I'm changing this to one star.  And no, we still won't be back.  For the same prices, we could have eaten at Strip, Nemo's, Fratello's, etc.  We won't make the same mistake twice."}
{"text":"Went here for New Year's Eve and wasn't all that impressed.  Got there right on the dot for our reservation and we were made to wait with a horde of people who also had reservations. Not a huge deal, but it would have been good if there was a place to wait other than on top of the tables already dining.  Once seated, the service was pretty good considering the place was packed and it was a holiday. And, our servers were all very polite and knowledgeable.  Here are my two biggest gripes:   1. The menu was prix fixe, the regular menu was not available even though I had called to specifically ask this question. The dude on the phone said it would be the regular menu with a few specials. It wasn't. The offerings for the entrees were extremely limited.  2. I ordered the pork chop and my husband got the scallops. The pork was really tough, as in, hard to chew. Plus, it was a very 'porky' flavor. I don't know if that makes sense, but it was very strong and almost gamy. The sides weren't bad (sweet mash and brussel sprouts), but overall I thought it was overpriced for the quality.  Because my husband liked his dish and I've heard good things about this place, especially the happy hour, I'll try it again on a non-holiday and stay away from the pork."}
