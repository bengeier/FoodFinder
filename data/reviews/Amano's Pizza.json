{"text":"Wonderful pizza, wonderful people. If you are a Chicago native and like stuffed pizza, order here. If you are not a Chicago native and don't know wtf a stuffed pizza is, order from here. Know that you will be waiting 40 minutes. They make it when you call, none sitting around. I'd pick it up, the drivers will go just about anywhere but you're adding on delivery time that you could be spending eating fresh hot pizza. This is not a sit down place, its counter only, but the owners are pleasant and chatty, the place spotless, and the pizza is awesome. Try the dessert pizza too."}
{"text":"4 of us tried the Wednesday Windy City special. It was a fair amt of food for the price but we all agreed we like Papa Dels better. For one thing bacon is not a topping choice, which the other 3 like and the sausage doesn't begin to compare. On the other hand I like a lot of sauce & this had that where some of the pizzas I've had from Papa Dels have had very little. I always ask them to please not be stingy with the sauce. I personally am not a deep dish lover & wouldn't get bacon or sausage if the pizza was just for me & I saw a lot of other menu items I'd like to try like the veggie lasagna & seafood pizza but for deep dish we'll stick with Papa Dels. The people working there were very friendly."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the midwest! The owners are some of the nicest, most genuine people you will ever meet. The pizza is top notch. This place sets the bar at a new level- from the friendly customer service to the huge menu to the fresh, homemade ingredients. Everything about Amanos is awesome."}
{"text":"A coworker of mine recommended that I try Amano's a while ago and I finally decided to give it a shot.  The first thing to know is that only carry out and delivery are available -- don't try to go in for a sit down meal (inside the building, you'll only find a large kitchen area and a counter).   While there are numerous items on their menu, I decided to try their deep dish pizza.  I am not from the Chicago area but I have eaten deep dish pizza from numerous establishments, both in the CU-area and in Chicagoland.  I would have to agree that Amano's pizza is better than Papa Del's and certainly on par with pizza from a \"real\" Chicago pizzeria.  Additionally, the prices were extremely reasonable.  A medium (12\") pizza with 3 toppings was barely over $15 and will provide two meals for my girlfriend and me.  As with all deep dish pizzas, expect to wait a bit for your pie to be ready (ours took about 35 minutes).    The only reason I did not give Amano's 5 stars is because the dough in our pizza was not cooked all the way through in some of the thicker areas.  I didn't mind but I would have preferred it to be fully cooked everywhere."}
{"text":"My sister came to town from Phoenix, AZ and wanted a Chicago-style, deep dish pizza experience. I was dubious, Champaign/Urbana is such a small town and I was new to the area, having moved here from Austin, TX. So I looked up pizza places on Yelp and it recommended Amano's. I called, ordered a Chicago-style medium supreme, waited 40 mins and went to pick it up. Amano's is located in a sad little half-abandoned strip mall on Philo road. It has no seating and looks like one of those hole-in-the-wall places you'd find out east. We got our pizza, got in our 1999 Corolla, and headed home, the car filling with that fresh pizza smell. When we got home we put in a movie (No Country for Old Men) and got ourselves one wedge each of pizza. If you're a connoisseur of Chicago-style pizza you'll know that there are those who like their crust well done and those who like it just short of fully done. The pie we had at Amano's was just short of fully crisped (but by no means doughy).  I ate two slices and felt satisfied, full even, however I talked myself into a third slice, my sister, a third sliver. We put the 2.8 remaining slices in the fridge and went to bed stuffed, though not in a I'm-so-sick-of-that-now sort of a way.  The next day we both wanted more of that pizza for lunch. We put the remainder in the toaster oven for 20 mins at 250 degrees. This is where having the crust just short of fully crisped made all the difference. When we took it out and dug in we were excited to find that it tasted as good as, if not better than, the night before."}
{"text":"Not sure if these are Amano's employees writing these reviews, but this pie is decidedly average at best. I ordered the stuffed sausage pizza. The sauce is very plain - like plain tomato sauce (as is the \"marinara\" for the garlic bread). The crust is really good and the cheese is not bad, but overall it is nothing special."}
{"text":"I was thrilled when I found out Amano's pizza was moving to Champaign.  I always heard rumors of their amazing pizza, but I never made it over to that part of Urbana to find out for myself.    Now, we order it probably a little too often for it to be healthy for us.  My husband and I just think it is fantastic.  I find myself craving it at least once a week.  We usually get the Chicago Style with pepperoni, mushrooms and green peppers.  It is amazing.  The ingredients taste really fresh.  The dough is thick, but not too chewy.  The sauce is so good.    I think everyone should give them a try."}
{"text":"Amano's Pizza kicks the ass of Papa Del's. Seriously. The people are much nicer, the pizza tastes better (and is more reasonably priced), and it's less crowded. It's in an icky strip mall in east Urbana, which is the only negative. I'm from the Chicago 'burbs, and Amano's reminds me of home. I have yet to try the pasta, but I will get around to it eventually--right now, I'm stuck on the cheese-and-sausage stuffed pizza.  There's no eat-in, and it's completely across town from where I live, so I don't get there as often as I'd like. This may be a good thing, because this is some MONSTER stuffed pizza, and frankly, I don't need all that extra cheese."}
{"text":"The deep dish pizza is fantastic.  We also ordered a salad and it was huge and very good.  The owner is excited to get business and very kind.  The prices are comparable and delivery was very fast.  I would recommend giving this place a chance!"}
{"text":"Staff: Nicest people I have ever met at a pizza place. I wanted to hug the grandma that was helping out for the day. Phone is usually busy when we call (like all other pizza places). Solution: Just drive there and wait for your order- It's worth it! The staff alone made me decide to be a repeat customer.  Food: Absolutely amazing! Fresh ingredients. Reasonably priced. Great daily specials. Smores Pizza = makes me feel fat, but awesome at the same time. I would definitely recommend. Just moved to Illinois a week ago and have been trying out local pizza places. This is definitely number 1 on my list!"}
{"text":"Top quality pizza. A family member recently ordered a thin crust, and it was good. We were told that their deep dish pizza was even better. So the next time, we ordered their deep dish with spinach and mushroom. The order was ready on time. I was really impressed when I went to pick it up and pay: the woman who rang up my order was friendly and helpful. So we got home and had it: might be the best deep dish I ever had. Yes, we've had plenty of Papa Dell's thin crust and deep dish over the years, and ate plenty of Giordano's deep dish when we lived in Chicago. IMO, Amano's pizza is better than Giordano's and just as good as Papa Dell's. Plus, the deep dish prices are Amano's are lower than Papa Dell's. And the folks at Amano's are super friendly and likeable."}
{"text":"I had skimmed the Yelp notices before coming down to visit my youngest son at U of I.  I was looking for a good alternative to the campustown and downtown Champaign restaurants that would be packed with Dads Day crowds, and in my haste I never picked up that Amano's was carryout and delivery only.  We found them in a semi-sketchy shopping strip but thought there must be more to it.  When I asked the owner where their sit-down location was, she responded that this was all there is, just a family-owned take-out  operation, but she did point out a table and chairs in the corner that we could have if we wanted to sit down and eat.  She was obviously proud of her business and could not have been nicer, so my sons and I luckily agreed to give it a shot.   My older son had started an Atkins-type diet and Mrs. Amano was very solicitous of his needs; she produced a bowl of plain meatballs (he said they were great) and a plate of spicy chicken wings which we all shared and which were also quite good.  The Chicago-style half-spinach, half-cheese pizza was wonderfully authentic and rivaled our favorite Lou Malnati's back home.  We pulled bottles of pop from the refrigerator case and called it a meal.  My youngest and I were also able to call the pizza t a late night snack as well as a light lunch the next day.  We do love our pizza, and the bigger the better.  We like to patronize family businesses whenever possible, and Amano's reminded us why.  Contrasting our Amano's visit with the usual Papa Del's Saturday dine-in experience (waiting 2x the estimated wait time...jammed in among other diners...distracted servers...hit-or-miss quality) made the rewards even more clear.  At Amano's they couldn't have been nicer or more accomodating, the food was great, and the value was outstanding."}
{"text":"Way to go Yelpers!  I discovered this fantastic place because of you all. The pizza is a bit pricey but well worth the money.  I was a bit thrown off by seeing a huge rack full of what I thing was canned sauce but that may have been the best thing ever to come out of a can this side of beer!    I ordered a 14' pepperoni, sausage, bacon, onion, and black olive deep dish pie and wasn't disappointed.  I could have done some cheap weight lifting with how heavy this monstrosity of deciduousness.  All of the toppings tasted fresh and the sausage was especially amazing.  I think my taste buds got pleasures to the point where it might have been sexual...I may have issues too but who knows?    Why 4 stars?  Well the first slight problem I had was that they offer free spices such as garlic, salt, pepper, and a whole host of others that I wish they would have told me about over the phone as I would have liked said spices to be heated with the pizza for better integration.  The other slight slip is that my pizza came unsliced.  This meant that I was made to suffer from unbearable hunger until I was able to squire a pizza slicer.  It was as if the pizza was playing with my emotions.  Both small issues but combined they cost a star because 5 stars are awarded for complete perfection.    Awesome grub though and I love to support mom and pop businesses!"}
{"text":"Amazing! This is my new pizza place! The seafood pizza is fantastic; think better than Pizzeria Uno's seafood pizza. We also had an excellent salad, and their Smore Pizza is decadent! The owner was so nice. Definately give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great deep dish alternative to Papa Dels.  Not as heavy and, I think, better sauce.  (But do love PD's too).  Family-run, to-go only pizza."}
{"text":"I really liked their stuffed crust pizza.  The delivery driver was late delivering the pizza because he admitted that he couldn't find my address.  Which is a first.  So I think maybe he isn't familiar with the area."}
{"text":"As a native Chicagoan I can say without question, this pizza is amazing. I am VERY picky about my deep dish pizza and this hits what I crave on every mark. The sauce is lovely and not too sweet, the toppings are wonderful (see: fresh portabello mushrooms), and the crust makes me think of home.  The price is also right and the sampling of non-pizza plates is good. Please please please support Amano's. It's deserving of the attention  I will be returning many times I can promise that"}
{"text":"Best deep dish pizza in town!  Seriously you won't find anything better in C-U. Papa Del's does come close tho. This place is truly a hidden gem! We live pretty close to it and we always wondered if it was any good. It's in the middle of a lonely strip mall. Very depressing.  So we decided to give it a try one night. We ordered the sausage and green olive stuffed pizza. The staff was very nice and down to earth. The pizza was fabulous! Having grown up in Chicago I have tasted some of the best deep dish pizza ever. When I came to Urbana 3 yrs ago I knew I'd never find anything like it. But Amano's has given me hope. Their pizza is tasty, saucy, fresh, cheesy, and the crust is perfect!  I have had many cravings for their pizza ever since. I could almost taste it in my mouth right now!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place has any good reviews.  I ordered from this place because of the reviews and was extremely disappointed.  The crust was the worst I have ever had from a take out place.  We ordered a regular crust and got what appeared to be an undercooked frozen cardboard tasting worthless pie.  I could not believe it.  The service, price, toppings, cheese,  and sauce were all fine but it doesn't matter if the crust is terrible!!!"}
{"text":"First of all, the good: We ordered a Chicago-style with sausage. The sauce was sublime, herby and savory and well-seasoned; the cheese was fine; and the crust was better than decent.  The two guys working when we came in were extremely nice and seemed to care that we had a good experience.  But the bad: The sausage was absolutely vile.  While consuming the pizza fresh, it was possible to pick it off and pretend that it had never existed.  However, an attempt to consume the cold leftovers led to the realization that the cheese had congealed, trapping the sausage and hindering its excavation.  I actually gagged attempting to eat it.  Not good.  Overall, I will probably be going back to try the thin crust and other or no toppings on the Chicago-style; however, I will never, ever get their sausage ever again.  I'm no picky eater, and I have no problem putting away the sub-standard processed meat-like substances that most chain places pass off as sausage, so I have no idea what was going on with Amano's.  I strongly advise avoiding the sausage, but not avoiding the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best chicago style in town.  Much fresher and lighter than papa del's.  Needs a little more cheese possibly, but great fresh ingredients made by a very friendly staff who seems to be mostly family.  We got the windy city special which is a steal for wing/salad, large 1 topping stuffed, a smores pizza(don't diss it until you have had it, the burnt marshmallow and chocolate is amazing!), and 2 20oz drinks all for something like $28!  Awesome! Will be coming back to try some of their unique thin crusts like cajun or buffalo wing."}
{"text":"My silliest housemate was driving us around the other night in late evening.  We noticed this place for the first time because the employees were all sitting out front, smoking.  It looked like a scene from the Sopranos.  The smell wafting forth was tempting; we mentally filed to try later.  Tonight was later.  We got the hand-tossed crust.  It's not thin or thick.  A nice balance.   Other reviewers have noted the sauce being particularly good and I can't disagree.  The pizza was so good and so cheap that after it was quickly devoured we called and ordered another one.  Great value on the prices.  And they delivery was faster than freaky fast!"}
{"text":"To add to my previous review, I hesitantly tried the seafood pizza as my first thin-crust experience, and it was about 10 times better than what I expected. Actually, I guess I'm not sure exactly what it was that I expected since I've never had a seafood pizza before, but the important thing is that this was pretty darn amazing. There was just enough crab and shrimp meat, the white sauce was subtle and balanced, and the cheese was plentiful. Five stars for the crust, too.  With Amano's being this good and inexpensive, it's beyond me why anyone in this part of town would ever order from the likes of Papa John's."}
{"text":"It used to be  that Papa Del's was the only place in town for a really good artery clogging deep dish pizza. Now's there's Amano's.  It's neither better or worse than PD's - just different.  It really depends on your preference on which you prefer.  In addition to the pizza the have some very very good other foods - the ravioli is excellent.    One other very important thing.  They owners are the best.  I would shop here just for them - even if their food were average (which it's not!)."}
{"text":"Wow, another hidden gem of deep dish pizza in the C-U area!  After nearly a 2 hour wait for delivery at Papa Del's we tried to find an alternative for our deep dish delivery craving on a Saturday. Well, mission: accomplished!  Delivery time was less than an hour from ordering and I do believe it cost less than Papa Del's for a similar sized pie.  We got sausage and pepperoni on ours and my only complaint was that there wasn't very much of either of these on the pizza, especially pepperoni. Although they were definitely not omitted, I'm not subtracting stars for that reason because I usually like my pizza very plain (cheese only) so it didn't matter to me.  We thought the sauce was a bit more liquidy than most Chicago style pizzas but actually realized this was a good thing because it dripped into the crust and cheese making it more flavorful.  It was loaded with wonderful cheese! Stringly, hot, gooey and awesome cheese! Yum!  Also noteworthy was the crust, it was not too thick and not too thin, as sometimes deep dish can be.   Overall we were pretty satisfied with our second deep dish delivery in the C-U area and I would definitely like to try some of Amano's other items as well.  Just because Amano's isn't right in Campustown doesn't mean it isn't worth getting!  I will order again!"}
{"text":"All I've had here is the seafood pizza, and it was very good!  Also, the sweet old lady working here just made me want to come back.  She was so friendly, and sincerely seemed to care that we liked the pizza.  Nicely done, Amano's."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but this doesn't hold a candle to Papa Del's. Can't understand the reviews that say otherwise. My guess is that people are tired of being mobbed by frat-douches and whoever else at Del's and want an alternative. So did I; this place did not deliver a suitable alternative.  I'm also from Chicago and used to Malnati's, Giordano's, Uno's, Geno's East, etc. The sauce here is SO bland. It was like eating crushed tomatoes out of a can. Reading the other reviews, it sounds like the sauce is inconsistent. Maybe if I went back ten times I'd eventually get a great pizza, but I've never had a bad deep dish from Del's. Not once in like 100 times.  The guy was friendly, and maybe they're cheaper (I don't really remember stuff like that) but I don't really care. What matters is how the pizza tastes. I can't ever see going to this place while Papa Del's is still in town. The difference in quality is considerable."}
{"text":"The first time I must have gotten an unrepresentatively bad pizza. The 2x times since, I have been very happy. The taste is exactly what I would expect in a Chicago-Style stuffed crust pizza, and so is the texture. While there may be a little variablity in the sauce, the service and value are consistently stellar. They are genuinely friendly here, and I have never seen better prices for the quality delivered. Better than Papa Dell's. I said it."}
{"text":"Talk about a great gem in a small town! Owned by a mom/son combo, this place is amazing. Fresh ingredients, well priced and friendly staff. Don't let this place pass you by. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"People always say that Papa Del's is where the stuffed pizza is at. NO WAY. Amano's is the best here. It's not as doughy and better seasoned. Trust me. Next time you feel like you want Papa Del's, give this a shot."}
{"text":"Deep dish is the best!  Great prices too.  If you have not eaten here yet, go there now!"}
{"text":"I just found my new favorite pizza joint.  Better than papa dels! I ordered the chicago style which i have to say is usually not my favorite, i prefer thin crust.  That said every now and again i have a hankering for chicago style and this one didn't disappoint.  What i don't like about chicago style is its often too doughy.  when i eat papa dels its like chewing on an undercooked dough ball and a lot of it.  not good.  Amano's crust however was fantastic, i ate every bite, not doughy at all with a nice \"pull\" you get from well crafted pizza dough. Nothing is more important than a great crust and they nailed it. Yes, sauce is important too and they have Great sauce, spice, great sausage (though papa dels sausage is hard to beat), just a really well balance pizza which isn't easy on a chicago style.  Family run, very clean, super friendly and fairly priced, go ahead eat great pizza!   As this was my first visit i'll have to update when i get a chance to try their thin crust.  cant wait!"}
{"text":"Bottom Line: Decent Deep Dish at a good price; 3.5 Stars.  Pros: Deep dish pizza (14\") supreme was large and really well priced.  Sauce, cheese, toppings, were great.  Con: It was a good pizza but I didn't really think it was truly deep dish.  I was expecting a thicker pizza.  I'm a huge fan of Giordano's, hence I set the 5 Star standard there.    Being that it's one of the very few deep dish places in Urbana I'd go here again."}
