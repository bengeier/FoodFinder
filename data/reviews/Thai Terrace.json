{"text":"I used to frequent Curry Away and I was highly disappointed when they closed. However, I am grateful that Thai Terrace has opened now in its place. The décor and setup remains practically the same, but my experience so far is that the service seems to be quicker and I the ingredients definitely taste more fresh. My go to meal is the Cashew Rice with Chicken. I ordered the same dish at Curry Away. Although I liked Curry Away's version with the fried breaded chicken, I prefer that Thai Terrace used grilled chicken instead. The ingredients and flavor are great and although the menu is not extensive, I look forward to trying other samples. My only complaint so far was my appetizer order of Chicken Satays. They were the smallest Satays I have ever seen for that price. Almost like 5 grilled nuggets on sticks. I will not order those again but will continue to try this new local Thai spot in Edgewood."}
{"text":"I ordered pineapple curry and Tom Yum soup. The food was really good, the curry was pretty spicy but flavorful.I love Thai food very much, they are delicious!! Also the price here is reasonable."}
{"text":"Worst Thai food I have ever had.  I ordered the Pad See Ew, or should I say Pad See Ewwwwww!  It was gross.  The chicken tasted like poor quality and like it had sat out for a day or so.  The vegetables were very soggy. Everything was caked together like a wad of who knows what..."}
{"text":"Pretty solid pad thai. Lobster rangoon is good too. Decent portions for the price. They never include silverware with my delivery order so that's why they lose a star."}
{"text":"Excellent little Thai joint in Edgewood that is perfect to get your Thai fix on. Nice entrees with your basic choices as far as flavor. Cooked to perfection and as spicy as asked. Ordered with family each having something different. Thai Basil rice with chicken, spicy Thai Basil with beef and drunken noodle with shrimp.  Everyone liked their entrees so I'm happy. Appetizers were great. Had spring rolls and Thai corn fritters. Fresh and made to order. Great service and BYOB! This was a great find in my local area. Will return, see you there!!"}
{"text":"This food was not great at all - my samosas were thin and didn't have potato, salad was soggy, bubble tea bubbles were the weirdest ones I've ever had. Definitely disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been living in Edgewood for over 3 years and one of the negatives about the location is a lack of decent delivery/carry out food options. Yes, Edgewood has a couple restaurants and bars near Regent Square but truthfully there isn't a large variety. Formerly Curry Away, my go to take-out service, and now reopened as another Thai restaurant for dine-in/take-out, I couldn't wait to try their product.

The menu isn't too extensive but offers enough variety. I scanned the appetizers and chose avocado wraps with a mint dipping sauce and chicken samosa's. For an entrée I decided to mix it up and go with a noodle dish; pad thai noodles in a yellow curry sauce, shrimp, bok choy, fried onions and eggplant. I was blown away by the flavor, the sauce had the perfect balance of sweet and spicy, the vegetables added a nice crunch and the portion was adequate for the price.

I did carry out and was quoted 15 minutes. Upon pickup my food was packaged and ready to go, everything hot and fresh to taste. The ambience is indoor/outdoor with a simple, tranquil feel and music to pair.

Truthfully the food tasted on par with dishes that I've had at my other favorite Thai spot, Nicky's Thai. I'm over the moon to have another dine in/take out restaurant near me, especially one as full of flavor as this one. Hopefully their quality continues, keep up the tasty work!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. The best Thai I have had in the Pittsburgh area! I have only gotten takeout so far, but everything I've tried is flavorful and spicy. Amazing."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout via Postmates. Noodlehead is our usual spot for quick Pad Thai, but we didn't feel like having to go in, place the order and then wait for it. Wasn't sure what to expect but it was absolutely delicious! The portion sizes were good too. I had enough for dinner and lunch the next day. We also got the spring rolls which were perfectly done. The only downside is that I didn't specify spice level (user error). I will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area, love Thai food and was looking for a go to place. I found it! Very reasonable prices. Food was delicious. I decided on a level three of spiciness.. it was a little spicer than I like but still delicious. Absolutely will order again!"}
{"text":"Ordered twice (by grubhub). I like their green papaya salad, which is not easy to come by. Crab Rangoon was good. Pad See Ew and Drunken Noodle were pretty good. But I was not impressed with the Pad Thai. (I hope they addressed the bathroom issue noted in the review below...it looks gross)"}
{"text":"Fast, convenient, and most importantly delicious delivery. A hidden gem of Thai food in the burgh."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Their food is always delicious. I usually get the Pad Thai and my bf gets the Yellow Curry and they're both great everytime. I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious. 

I rarely (never) write restaurant reviews, but I had to for Thai Terrace. I've had a lot of the Thai food Pittsburgh has to offer, but Thai Terrace is far and away the best. Their food tastes great, they have a good selection and they're willing to customize to make your order exactly how you want it. 

I highly recommend Thai Terrace."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here. Food was amazing! Everything taste wise was perfect and prices are reasonable. Crab Rangoon, spring rolls, pad Thai, crab fried rice. Generous portions and great flavor. No complaints. Looking forward to ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This place has the best Thai food including our favorite, crab rangoons. They're fast, efficient and friendly and very convenient to where we live. Wish there were more places with outdoor seating we could walk to like this one."}
{"text":"Thai Terrace is delicious and close by, so my boyfriend and I have gotten several meals here already. We've always stuck to the same order, and we've never been disappointed. We usually get a pad see ew each (shrimp for him, tofu for me) in addition to one or two orders of the chicken samosa appetizer. Both the chicken samosas and the pad see ew are very oily, but also delicious. 

As they are called chicken samosas, you'd think that they'd have more chicken inside than they actually do, but don't order them expecting a lot of meat because it's pretty minimal. They are thin samosas and super tasty. Definitely will continue to order them. 

So glad Thai Terrace opened up. It always hits the spot!

{"text":"I have had meals at the thai terrace location and ordered take out as well. This is a small but delicious place with friendly service. My favorite dishes are the veggy dumplings and and panag curry."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here a while back off of UberEATS. The food took quite a while to arrive but it was partially because the driver had a long way to go. I got the curry triangles and the pad see ew - both were just okay. The food was very greasy, but the flavor was alright. Good prices for the amount of food you get. I'm curious to stop in and see if it's any better dining in!"}
{"text":"I loved their food. That is, until I had to use the restroom one day. There was about an inch high of just water and mold everywhere. They didn't even bother to clean up the water. Along with the disgusting conditions there were mouse and roach traps everywhere. 

When I went up to pay, after seeing all this I looked into the back of the restaurant, something I had never paid attention to before & it looked just as filthy as the bathroom. 

One star because you can't just have amazing food and neglect keeping your restaurant clean and maintaining it. Someone could get seriously sick with a restaurant kept in these conditions."}
