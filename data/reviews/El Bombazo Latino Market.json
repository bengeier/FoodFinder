{"text":"The El Bombazo Market on 17th Ave SE offers a somewhat scant selection of Latin foodstuffs. Which makes sense, when you factor in the extremely limited size of the space they're working with.  That being said, they do have an assortment of both white and yellow corn tortillas, as well as a limited selection of canned goods and spices. It is clean, and the staff were friendly and browsing was a breeze, as there just wasn't much to look at.  However, if you happen to be in the area and crave some authentic tortillas, then El Bombazo has got you covered on that front. Or better yet, go next door to their restaurant and have them cook authentic Latin food for you!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say, this place has closed.  Thought they were just closed for holidays, but no - there is no another restaurant going in there (passed by Mar. 10, 2012)"}
{"text":"The only Latino Market I've visited in Calgary so far, El Bombazo is a tiny little shop that caries the staples of Latino cooking.  With shelves filled with black beans, rice, corn tortillas, salsas, herb teas, tamirand paste and Mexican chocolate used for cooking, El Bombazo has got your basics covered.  Having been around since 2002, El Bombazo is a great addition to our city."}
{"text":"I have to say that they have the best Pupusas in Calgary. I have taken friends from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras here, and for takeout. They all have told me how much they enjoyed eating a dish that was as good as at home. Their tamales are excellent too. I must warn you that Central American tamales are much different than the Mexican ones that most people have eaten, as they almost are like eating a delicious sweet corn cake, and they may not have a meat or vegetable filling. They only have chicken tamales on the weekends, other wise they are just plain. The service is also excellent!"}
