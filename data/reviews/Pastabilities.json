{"text":"From gourmet to no way!

Pastabilities started out on King street about 2 years ago. Their vision was to make REAL gourmet pasta and still deliver it fast to meet the needs of the lunch rush. For about the first year and a half, they did a great job - so good that they opened a second location here in Sick Kids Hospital. The Sick Kids location started out just as great as it's King Street counterpart, and I was a regular customer of both locations. Yes, I would go out of my way to go to a hospital for the pasta, it was that good. See Kat T's review for all the foodie details - none of them apply now anyways.

But then something happened. About two months ago, the management changed hands and  I noticed the colorful cast of characters working there start to disappear and all being replaced by some more... \"efficient\" workers. Now, the place has gone to the dogs. You'll never get a consistent pasta there, half of the new staff don't have a clue what they're doing, the quality of the ingredients has gone downhill, and - worst of all, everybody seems to be run like slaves by this short lady who has no problem chewing out her staff in front of customers in what sounds like Bengali. 

Used to be the best, now it's just like the rest. Faster than ever, dirty as a dog and just an unhappy place to be. Skip it."}
{"text":"This bright (yellow!!) little shop at the corner of Church and King just recently opened up. I'd see it everyday from the King streetcar, and wonder.Pasta.. hmm wonder if the food is \"creative\" as the name suggests? Will this go into my regular lunch-spot rotation? Is it a chain?
Well... today I decided to find out, and was quite pleased. As soon as we stepped inside I was greeted by one of the girls working and she asked us if we'd been there before and explained that you pick the type of pasta, the sauce(6 vegetarian options), and the garnish(parsley or type of cheese). I tried the vodka-smoked salmon rose sauce with rotini, and upon the suggestion of the girl working there had some chili flakes added to my pasta (excellent suggestion!). The pasta was delicious! The salmon was plentiful. the rotini wasn't mushy or overcooked & there was a good sauce vs pasta ratio.
Although I loved what i ordered, upon trying a bit of my friends pesto pasta, i found perhaps that not all the items on the menu are good.The pasta was a bit dry, and not as flavourful as i would like. The garlic bread my friend reported was way too greasy as well. I guess I will stick to the salmon pasta for now, before trying more \"pastabilities\".
The larger size ($9, only one dollar more than the regular size) is good enough for 2 servings. I don't know if this will go into my regular lunch rotation, but definitely be visited again.

Had to write something here! I'm really surprised by the comments i read about this fast food place. Maybe a prior poor management issue, but my experience was really good. I work across from Sick Kids Hospital and I just ordered a smoked salmon with rose sauce on fettucine noodle... and I am considering going back for more. today. the dish literally gets made fresh before your eyes (i ordered at 12:30 and my meal was hot and in my hand at 12:33), and you get some fresh toasted garlic bread along with the order. The fella at the register was very sweet and recommended it to me. otherwise i could have made my own, but with those pastabilities already made, I will leave my own concoction until I've tried a few more dishes. the roasted chicken and proscuitto with basil pesto is next. anyway if youre looking for something really fresh and flavourful and FAST you should try this place out. Lots of caf seating, too, so its good for a colleague's dine out,"}

Lunch Pick up from Pastabilities :) Made mine penne with alfredo sauce with chicken and mushrooms. Every pasta comes with 2 pieces of garlic bread. Om nom nom"}
{"text":"Fresh made pasta, good sauce, good service, lots of seating. 
I think their staff needs to all be trained the same way because I have been there on multiple days and each time the pasta I get is all different. Sometimes too watery, sometimes not enough sauce, or too much sauce. The garlic bread is either too garlicy, or not enough. I can't say it has ever been consistent. 
Regardless, on a good day, you can get a great bowl of pasta."}
{"text":"Healthy, hot, freshly prepared food in a hospital?! Unfortunately hospital food has a terrible past as bland and unappealling. However, the food for the guests and staff at Sick Kids just got better with Pastabilities. This place just opened in the location that formerly housed Burger King (really, can it get any less healthy?). 
It's a new take on customized meals in minutes. Choose from the menu or build your own pasta bowl. Portions are pretty huge, and I'd love to have a kids size next time. But, kid-friendly sizes only offer kid-friendly basics like noodles with red sauce or butter. 
I tried the very adult combo of chickpea, Rapini, tomatoes, garlic, basic topped off with olive oil dressing. The ONLY problem was too much food, and by the bottom, my multigrain spaghetti was drowning in EVOO."}
{"text":"I had lunch here for the first time today, and I'm still to full to write a review... but I'll try anyways. For starters, the large is LARGE. When I got back to the office, I poured my dish out of the pasta box into a bowl, and I really  should have used two. And it should be large -- most Pastabilities dishes break through the take-away lunch $10 barrier without even looking back! I had the Arabiatta with spicy Italian sausage, sun dried tomatoes and onions. In true Italian tradition, the dishes are simple are made with high quality ingredients. My dish wasn't as spicy as advertized, but it still tasted great. If you can get over spending $10+ on a take-away lunch, you could do far worse than Pastabilities."}
{"text":"Definitely decent in a crunch. The food is fast and affordable, not to mention quite filling. The Vodka Signature Salmon which consisted of fresh smoked salmon in a ros√© sauce, a mix of classic tomato sauce and fresh cream, with a splash of vodka has been my choice on both occasions. If it ain't broke... 

Pastabilities allows you to consider among six types of pasta, from agnolotti to orrechiette and in addition provides suggestions as to garnishes based upon sauce type. A nice touch. A large, approx $9.99 can be stretched into two mid size meals, and is just as good the next day."}
{"text":"I've since returned to the location and ordered the same dish, but instead with penne, and just wanted to write a follow-up. Much, much better this time around! The service is more fluid, the pasta actually cooked, and I see they are applying for a liquor licence (good on them!). I will now have Pastabilities included in my rota of lunch haunts."}
{"text":"After great anticipation of the opening of Pastabilities, I was quite pleased with the experience I've had there. 

The first time I went, I was welcomed by the hostess, who explained the layout to my group. There are sauce options and pasta-shape options (including slightly more expensive agnolotti). There are also a selection of desserts (the brownies are great!), salads, and garlic bread. 

I've had the vodka smoked salmon with rose, and the spicy italian sausage  - I've also tried the spicy arrabiata, and the cold pasta salad. 

Of these options, my favorite was by far the salmon rose, and second favorite the arrabiata. The sausage option was just okay, as the sauce was almost watery (kind of disappointing after the great first experience with the salmon). Also, the cheese garlic bread is greasy and heavenly (not for those on a diet...). 

Another thing I would have LOVED to know going in, is that I CANNOT EAT A LARGE. I ate it for lunch and dinner that day. The next time I went I opted for a small, but was still stuffed after finishing it - and my friends with less voracious appetites can only get about half-way through a small. Be prepared to take home left-overs!  

What is really great about this place is its charm. I love the decor, and the bench seating. Also, the cooks are fantastic! They make great suggestions and all seem to really enjoy working there. 

This is certainly on my list of lunch places for the school year!"}
{"text":"3 and a half more precisely. Pasta are really fresh and tasty and served portions are really genereous. My point is that they should work a little bit harder on the sauce and meatballs. By doing so, everything would taste fresh and not with a taste of \"just defrozen in the microwave\" before being spread (not as genereously as the noodles, at least if you order metballs - better opt for bolognese, which is served in large amount but is a quite oily) on top of the noodles. It would be much tastier. In addition, it would probably make the whole meal warmer (was just medium hot). FInally, such a place should remain open later in the night (closes at 10PM)."}
{"text":"Fast-food pasta on King West.  The inside is bright with an exposed brick wall and light-wooden benches.  Not a bad place to hang out, but I took my pasta to go.  The pasta protocol is as follows: choose from about ten sauce flavours, then choose your noodle, and garnish to your liking.  They also serve soup, salads and garlic bread.  Of the two take-out sizes available I got the small and it was MORE than enough.  The classic green pesto with penne was tasty, but a bit oily.  Clearly the pasta is freshly made, but not sure if it's worth the bucks.  Still, it was tasty.

Obligatory Title Pun: You'll be SHELLING out for all the PASTABILITIES.

Menu Readability:  Sans serif typeface cleanly spaced on an overhead board. The entire resto smacks of minimalism.  I like it!

Need to mention:  Green pesto is nut-free and they have whole wheat penne.

What this place teaches me about myself:  I'm thinking of converting into a pastafarian."}
