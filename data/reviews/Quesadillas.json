{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic. The food was out right away and it was superb. The only thing better than the food was the service. We had a young waiter, C. Mendez, and he was immensely helpful and patient to us gringos. Well done!"}
{"text":"This place is ahhhhmazing! As a so cal transplant, ive been looking for some bomb mexican food, and I think I just found my spot! Plus, they have 2 for 1 margaritas ;)"}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant in the area! The food is delicious and priced well. The staff is exceptionally friendly and the service is excellent! Their drinks are very good not over nor under poured. The restaurant is clean with a nice patio. The owner is always present making sure everyone is satisfied but also helping in faster  serving.
My hubby and I ended up going there every Friday.
My favorite food there is the Amherst Quesadilla. Their Fajitas is the best!"}
{"text":"Wow. Never have I had such a terrible experience at a Mexican restaurant. It started out as a very nice evening with my family that turned into being yelled at obnoxiously by over-served patrons. Our food took forever to arrive and our drinks were not refilled, nor were our chips and salsa, even after we asked. The food was not fresh and my mom's margarita was full of salt. Then, I asked the table next to us politely to please be quieter and in return was screamed at and called a \"whore b*tch\" with the staff listening. If a restaurant cannot control obscene language screamed by patrons, I will definitely not return. The staff did not apologize- I told a waitress that word-of-mouth was very powerful, especially in a small town and her reply was \"This is my family's restaurant and I really don't care who you tell\". Awful experience and my family and I will not be back."}
{"text":"We usually visit Don Tequilas in Amherst but the wait was too long, decided to give this place a chance and we are so glad we did. The food was very good and the margaritas were even better. Usually the pitcher is all ice but not here. The atmosphere was fun and the server was friendly. This will be our first choice for margarita night from now on. Give it a shot for good food and drink."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  My favorite Mexican restaurant, right in downtown Amherst!  Great margaritas too!"}
{"text":"Slowest service at a Mexican restaurant I have had. When questioned about how long the food was taking, we were told it would be a little longer in an I don't care attitude. Terrible service. Will not return!!"}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow, food was ok, and to top it off we were overcharged for our meal. When we confronted the owner he was rude and had a \"dont care\" attitude. We will never be back"}
{"text":"Very nice Mexican restaurant with a family run vibe. They have some great vegetarian items. I've had the taquitos a couple of times. Not a lot of places offer those around here. This doesn't have the attitude or the high prices that a lot of the \"contemporary \" Mexican food placed have in the area and that is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. I don't think Mexican food should cost $30 - $50! Though I haven't sat out there, they also have a nice patio on the side."}
{"text":"This place is just hands down yummy goodness!!! There isn't a bad thing on the menu and service is always spot on! When you come in sometimes the servers are singing along with the music over head...must say they sing well also :-). If you go in and are a regular they know you by name and treat you even more as family than what they already do if its just your first time. What a great place I always try and make it a first date kind of place because the price is reasonable and the service is top notch!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch when we were in Amherst and loved it! My boyfriend had the vegetarian fajitas and the variety of vegetables was way better than most Mexican places I've been. I had the potato enchiladas which were also very good, and the house made hot sauce was to die for. The service was friendly, attentive, and timely. Would definitely return any time we're back in Amherst."}
{"text":"Ordered: Burrito California
Price: $7.44 w/o tax

Ambiance: Exactly what I expect from a Mexican restaurant, a place that tantalizes the senses. Bright walls of yellow and magenta that grab your attention, South American decorations to keep you curious and bouncy ranchero music filled with brass :) the service was very friendly and the wait for food very short.

Food: You start with a complimentary basket of warm chips served with a fresh mild salsa. Some places stumble here with salsas that taste like jar sauce or Italian tomato sauce but not these guys, it's legit salsa. I got the Burrito California which is essentially a steak burrito with rice and beans covered with a ladle of queso sauce and served with sides of lettuce, sour cream, and guacamole. This is one of the places that marinates their steak well, it was nice and tender and only slightly mealy. The rice and beans were texturally perfect and flavorful although I like my burritos without them. The guac was a little weak, being filled with excessive amounts of onion/cilantro that drew attention away from the creamy savoriness of avocado.

Overall this place is very good, especially when you put it in the context of the Midwest. The food is prepared very well and the service excellent. I'm not sure how authentic it is to serve burritos with queso sauce but I won't argue with the results. I won't get in to how California burritos have French fries in them in California. The main downside here is that the prices were a little exorbitant for the portions but were reasonable once you factor in the cost of the 'complimentary' chips & salsa. Bottom line though, I'd come back here again for my Mexican fix."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get Mexican food in Amherst. The service is very friendly and attentive. The food is tasty and served fast. My only quam is wishing it were bigger. The expansion to the outside patio was a wonderful touch."}
{"text":"They serve pretty darn good Mexican food"}
{"text":"Good service, nice location but parking can be a pain. Ive just had better mexican food elesewhere to ever come back, but if you re in amherst and want a margarita and a burrito, i say give it a try."}
{"text":"Where to start.  First they brought me the wrong food.  Not a big deal.  Just told them to put my correct order in a to go container.  My fajitas were very dry.  But here is the HUGE problem I have.  When I checked my bank statement they doubled my bill and tip.  So instead of me being charged $58 I was charged $116.  I went down three times that day waiting on the owner.  He took all my info then said he would get in touch with me.  He called me one time two days later.  Not a word since then.  So I will NEVER be back to this establishment.  My daughter and I in no way spent $116.  Check your bank statements if you eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town.  The enchilada special is awesome.  You get 5 different enchiladas for under $10 and it comes with rice and refried beans.  I get it every time I eat there.  The carryout is so fast you can order while driving there and it is ready when you get there.  DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten here a lot over the years and have tried a bit of everything on the menu I think! We always have a wonderful time and have never been disappointed with the food! My 10 year old picks this as his birthday dinner spot every year! My favorite is the fajitas, husband usually goes for the platter of several different items and my kids love the quesadillas. Chips are always warm and fresh and the salsa is a perfect blend of mild with just a little kick. I like that they are family owned and operated and would recommend eating here if you want great and authentic food!"}
{"text":"Good food - had the deluxe burrito - I would consider it somewhat of a hybrid between authentic Mexican and modernized Mexican food. Either way, it was good.

Great service - very friendly and attentive.

Good atmosphere - nice indoor seating with Mexican decor. I opted for the large outdoor patio, which was very nice."}
