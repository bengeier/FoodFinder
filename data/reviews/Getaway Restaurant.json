{"text":"I decided to try out this place last week - HORRIBLE. - I ordered a Chicken Clubhouse sandwich & the Wife ordered pasta in tomato sauce. I never thought a Clubhouse could be made this bad, but they managed to do it - the chicken was dry as shoe leather, the bread stale & burnt & the cheese on it, was well beyond it's prime. My wife's pasta, was 7 steps beneath canned. We won't be going back - EVER. - We couldn't Get away fast enough, or far enough."}
{"text":"Yes its a restaurant inside the casino. Yes I saw the low ratings before trying it out.  We were in the casino and we decided to give this place a try. I ordered the noodle bowl with tofu and veggies. It comes with ice cream and cookies but since neither are vegan I asked the waiter not to bring them. I have had better noodles at pretty much every noodle / pho restaurant I have been to.  Maybe there is something else better on the menu. I don't know. But the noodle bowl is surely not worth it."}
{"text":"I co-hosted a golf tournament at a nearby golf course and they didn't have a dining room so we arranged to have our dinner and awards presentations here.  Our guests really liked the venue and they enjoyed the food. Our server, whose name I can't remember (sorry) was excellent. He kept our glasses filled, our tables cleaned, and (along with the kitchen staff) kept the buffet topped up.  Our buffet menu included: House Salad with 3 assorted dressings Caesar Salad Dinner rolls with butter Roasted Chicken Dijon Au Jus Country Roasted Pork Spinach and Ricotta Cannelloni Italian Style Pasta and Meatballs Mediterranean Mashed Potato Rice Pilaf Steamed Seasonal Vegetables Assorted mini cakes, dessert bars, and squares  All of the food was very good but I particularly enjoyed the chicken and the Caesar salad.  Popular opinion suggests that we do this again - same golf course and same dinner. I agree.  BTW, I got a hole-in-one at the tournament!"}
{"text":"Wow been eating at getaway in Brantford for years went for buyers one night.  They were so small I thought they were sliders, we sent them back asked for the manager and he came.  Then he brought the same food back to us to eat nice small and cold.  Went to customer service and they offered us a free meal next time and we took it.     We still go and enjoy the food just will never order the burgers again."}
{"text":"Is there anyone here to serve us? Hello! Anyone??? I'm thirsty and I'd love a cold beer! I think I'm actually being ignored on purpose. Maybe the worst service I've ever had. Wings were good, but they don't make up for the lack of service. I can walk here from home, and I was so hoping I was going to enjoy this place."}
{"text":"I always hate eating here with my family. Service always takes forever. I think they do this because they want you to go back to the casino while you're waiting for the food. I usually have to wait a bit of time to be seated when there are servers that are on the floor that see me waiting. I don't know why they just don't seat me? Also sometimes servers can have a bit of attitude. I hate coming here but I only come because of the food vouchers."}
{"text":"This review is based on their Lobster and Prime Set Dinner Special for $14.99 on Thursdays.  I don't usually eat at Casino's restaurants but this seems to be a good deal as I love lobster tails. Getting a table can be difficult and time consuming as everyone in the area seems to come here for this deal.   Pro-Tip: Either come super early or really late (after 9:30 pm). The hostess would advice you if there's still availability when you check in and pick up your buzzer. Make sure you do have your membership card ready as each diner has to have their own in order to qualify for the specials.  For $14.99, I have no complaints. The lobster tails were sizable and fresh. The prime rib was tender and juicy even without any gravy. And for a complete dinner with salad and dessert??   Would I be back?? I am not sure because we did end up waiting for 90 minutes or so (after you picked up your buzzer, you can just go feed the slots while waiting)"}
