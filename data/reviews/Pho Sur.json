{"text":"Ok, I have a real hard time giving a place a 1 star rating.  I think almost every place has some redeeming quality to it.  I've gone in here a few times for Som Tum which is green papaya salad.  I miss it so much from when I spent time in Thailand so even though it was $8 I was still willing to get it because it was the only place I was aware of that serves it.  I came back after a while and saw the Som Tum was up to $9...man, I already thought $8 was too much.  I come back a year or so later and it's up to $10.50 I think.  OMG!  Ok, fine, I will pay the exorbitant price cause I want it that bad.  I get my Som Tum on a bed of spring lettuce mix that was getting wilty, like I would not notice because it was a bed for the papaya salad to sit on (which is definitely not how it is served in Thailand).  I am trying to enjoy it despite the cost and 2/3 of the way in I find a hair in it.  I don't cause a stir over such things and perhaps I should.  I could have at least had my overpriced papaya salad comped.  The host asked me how it was and I pointed out the hair and he was in denial that it could have been one of theirs...lol.  I can't believe that sort of behavior from a host.  I brushed it off.  My gf and I split a few other dishes.  I got the honey orange chicken which I swear was the easy bake packaged kind from Costco...the kind you just throw in the oven or frier and add the pre made sauce.  I know it was.  The chicken was not even whole meat but some pressed mystery meat varietal.  I had a few bites and that was enough for me.  We also ordered some red curry and some other dish and I swore it was the same dish with exception to a few different vegetables.  This review I am giving is from a year ago, so things have changed,perhaps.  I just felt like adding it to my list of reviews.  I do most of my own cooking and now that my parents regularly travel to the bay area, they pick me up green papaya from time to time so I can make my own Som Tum that is delicious and nutritious.  Sorry Pho Sur but I doubt I will ever make it back...and that's FO' SURE!"}
{"text":"It was...okay.  The fiance and I came through because we're sick, don't want to cook, and I was craving some yummy, healthy, spicy Asian food. We got the yakisoba, Mongolian beef, General Tsao's chicken and orange chicken, and they came with a side of rice. I was most disappointed in both of the chicken entrees; for $10, you literally get nine nugget-sized pieces of overcooked chicken. The Mongolian beef was okay, and the yakisoba was alright. All are basil-heavy, and the General's chicken was almost coated in green onions. Bottom line, it wasn't terrible, but I am not happy that I spent $40 on this. To be honest, I enjoy Panda Express more. However, I think the place has potential and will probably come back at some point and try the pho, Thai fried rice and pad thai, but I don't know for sure. I guess they're one of the better places in Phoenix, but it just wasn't what I expected. Not terrible, but not great. Maybe it was just an off night."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing, but has gotten worse with each time I've visited over the past year. My most recent visit will be my last. The pad Thai was awful, no flavor or spice at all, no garnish to be found and it looked like it was slopped into the to-go box.  It's such a bummer because it used to be the best place to get Pho in the valley."}
{"text":"I am a Pho connoisseur. I have had good Pho and not so good Pho. But never Pho that I had a hard time eating. Maybe they were just having an off day. The broth tasted like a concentrated beef bouillon. Too strong to eat, missing the traditional spices like star anise, ginger and garlic. The beef was dry and didn't look fresh, the jalepenos appeared to have been previously frozen. They served cilantro on the plate instead of basil with a lime wedge and a modest amount of sprouts. I was hungry so I ate the food and left the broth. I had to get a bite down the street to clear my head because I couldn't stop thinking about how bad it was and the taste was lingering on my tongue.  However the server was sweet and cute as a button."}
{"text":"The food I had there a while back was OK. Not awesome, just OK. I have had Pho from some awesome places, include some holes-in-the-wall around LA.   But I am pretty dismayed that you FAILED your most recent health inspection. Not just a low grade... FAILED! Do you know how hard it is to fail a health inspection?!?!? I mean you literally have to INTENTIONALLY not clean the place and have unsanitary conditions. I am so pissed that I ate that food!!  I won't be eating there again until you pass with flying colors... assuming you stay open that long. I hope you do."}
{"text":"One word.... WOW!!! my wife and I went to phoenix to go to one of our favorite spots and they were closed.. So on a friends recommendation we went right down the road to Pho Sur. We ordered three separate dishes. The chicken Pho, mango Chicken and pad thai. The Chicken Pho was amazing. Rice noodles broth bean sprouts basil cilantro... The mango chicken had an amazing sauce and flavor. On the other hand I have had better pad thai so that's why I gave it four stars. Very large menu with Thai, Vietnamese, and Asian selections you are sure to find what you are looking for. Service was a little slow but worth the wait for sure. The waiter also came out and asked if we enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"First time and pleasantly surprised! Extensive menu, moderate pricing, clean and personal service.  My son is a vegetarian and I look forward to sharing this new spot with him."}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant.  It must be under new management because the food has nose dived. It is bland, flavorless and underwhelming. The special beverages like thai iced tea and bubble tea were watered down and we're unappealing after the first sip.   I also have an allergy to certain foods, and the staff did not know their product well.  I ended up having a sever reaction and had to rush out to take my medication.   Take my advice,  go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience ever.  These people have no idea how to run a restaurant.  They prioritize and cater to call in and take out orders over customers in their restaurant, only one server could take orders and she was on the phone and taking take out orders, you try to ask a bus person for another beverage or if you can order and they ignore you and walk away.  They must of brought the wrong food to over 5 tables just when we were there.  The server \"forgot\" to put one of our entree's on her order pad, so my wife and I left that night splitting an entree after waiting over an hour for it.  How do you forget to write down the second entree ordered at the table.  There were only 2 of us ordering!?!?!?  Food was mediocre and I left their hungry as it took so long to get food, and we didn;t even get it all.  I expect and hope to see this place go down in the next 3 months."}
{"text":"Pho? NO! What I had was nothing resembling pho. I took my Vietnamese wife who was very much missing the pho restaurants in Idaho, where she lived before. Come on, Idaho has better pho than here? Even if I had never tried pho before I would have called this just plain bad soup. There is so much bad I could say about it, but there was nothing good. It was almost as watery as my friend's \"curry chicken,\" which did have chicken, but he said there was no sign of the green curry it was supposed to be. Everything was watery. The sauces in squeeze bottles did nothing to improve the flavor of my soup because they were nearly flavorless themselves. My wife asked for fish sauce and the waitress brought out a dish of sugary water that had no hint of any other flavor. We had to actually ask for bean sprouts and there was no basil.   The service was as described in other reviews with the waitress (who also was the cook) trying to tell us what we wanted and what we ordered, as if there was some possibility that we wouldn't know. She was talking so much about things I didn't care about that I couldn't even concentrate enough to order and sort of just let her pressure me into ordering the beef pho, though I was considering other dishes. It was freezing in there and when my wife brought it up, she was told that they could only offer to bring a space heater out, but insisted that there was no place to plug it in even after my wife pointed out the electric sockets. We all agreed that it was the worst ever restaurant meal, and that they should be banned from having pho in their name. My wife said it was a con and that it is giving Vietnamese food a bad reputation. \"It's lost it's soul.\""}
{"text":"Got the chicken pho and wasnt really impressed at all. Really bland flavor but at the same time it is pho and it somehow always hits the spot no matter how terrible it can be. If you can find better go for it but it isnt awful either."}
{"text":"After moving to the Rogue Valley from Portland I was missing my PHO connections.  I am happy and deliciously pleased to have found Pho Sur in Phoenix Oregon.  The PHO is excellent.  The service is wonderful and I will definately be back. So happy to have found this little gem."}
{"text":"Vegetarian pho is made with chicken broth. We were told this after eating there a couple times and being told it was in fact vegetarian. Don't appreciate being lied to about what I'm eating.,"}
{"text":"Disgusting/gross/dirty. After eating Pho in two countries and four states, I can honesty say this is the worst (and most expensive)  Pho I have had.   The chicken pho was made of soy miso powder (miso cloudy) and the beef pho tasted like bullion. There was absolutely no aromatics like star anise in it. My thin rare slices of beef were well done boiled before it was served in the just above lukewarm soup. This stuff although manifesting the image of Pho, is without the power of the magic stuff. I have made far better stuff at home using Pho soup packets from the Asian market.   There is also no rooster sauce! There was some watered down orange chili sauce in a squeeze bottle.   DIRTY!! I had to send back our three Pad Thai plates because they were  Crusty Dirty. The squeeze bottles were so dirty with layers of sticky, I had to use a napkin to hold them. Trust me, I have eaten in dozens of hole in the  wall Pho joints in California and this one wins the NASTY Award."}
{"text":"My wife loved the Pho, and we used to live in a Viet Namese neighborhood. Fresh veggies and really HOT. My Pad Thai was just all right,. But hey, it's not a Thai restaurant,is it? Waitress seemed grumpy, and my dish came a full 5 minutes after my wife's. We'll try it again though."}
{"text":"Something has definitely changed. Very poor pho, watery broth,  little meat and zero service.  First time in my life I left no tip. Bummer"}
{"text":"I need to update this because several people tried this place based on my original review which was back when Pho Sur had different owners. The new owners have ruined this place. The food is terrible now and not at all what it once was. I no longer recommend this place!"}
{"text":"so glad this place is here! the thai iced tea could have used more condensed milk. the pai thai was better than average with huge portions! service was very friendly even with me being in a hurry."}
{"text":"So disappointed. This was very good, but last tthree times were progressively worse.  Cleanliness is a real issue. Food tasted spoiled. Waitress was not accommodating. We paid full price even though we couldn't get through the meal. Another table was having the same problem. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've missed real Asian food since moving to the valley from the bay. Fan Pho ken tastic Pho. We had the traditional beef. Sides were all very fresh. The Pad Thai tasted fine but was a little mooshy. I saw a few other entrees on diners tables and they all looked great.Others have complained about the lighting but the pinkish filters are better than obnoxious flourescents. Maybe they'll upgrade soon. It seems like business is booming."}
{"text":"No more pink fluorescent lighting!  Hooray!  Also had a very memorable dinner outing, but my wife doesn't want me to write about it b/c she thinks it'll reflect poorly on the restaurant.  I think it'll reflect favorably, but wife knows best!  Let's just say the Pad Thai was tasty.  Just don't get it with shrimp."}
{"text":"Pho Sur is a great place to go for its signature dish.  The pho here is great, the broth is not to over flavored and tastes very natural.  I am really picky when it comes to pho and Pho Sur really hits the spot when it comes to it.  I will definitely a repeat customer when I make a trip to Medford."}
{"text":"Every stir fry  item that we have ordered here had a sweet  sauce in such quantities that it overpowered the taste of the fresh vegetables and meat and is served in a bowl rather than a dish. Mainly for too generous and sweet sauce I awarded two instead of three stars. If you like sweet sauces--this may be your type of place.  This evening one friendly but very busy woman was waiter, cook, hostess and dishwasher.  But since most dishes are very similar and the ingredients are prepared, she quickly cooks up and serves.  I had faint hopes that the Chinese new year dish known in Hawaii as monks' food or  jai or  Luóhàn zh?i, would be on the menu. But not so.  It is vegetarian dish favored by Bhuddist monks and the best has a wide variety of mushrooms and fungi along with bamboo shoots and water chestnuts and other vegetables.  The Golden Duck in Honolulu still servers an excellent dish. Be that as it may, for sure you may get a decent under $10 meal here."}
{"text":"Surpised to find this place.....go for the Pho....service good...not the best vibe but not bad for being in a strip mall."}
{"text":"My parents raved about the duck potstickers, and ordered several plates of steamed ones. I also got a vegetarian pho. Coming from Bay Area, I've had many a bowl of pho and didn't appreciate this one. Broth was quite unflavorful and I had to keep adding Sriracha and hoisin and even soy sauce to get some flavor into it. But the duck potstickers are the reason to go to this place! DELISH!! I could eat several plates of them and plan to next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I was sick and their pho hit the spot! Just wish there were more greens. There was lots of soup and noodles and plenty of meat for the beef pho but not enough greens for me =) still great though!"}
{"text":"My daughter and her hubby introduced us to Pho Sur. They raved about the new Asian restaurant within walking distance of their place in Phoenix. Since both Herself and I love Asian cuisine, we decided to give it a try. The moment we walked in we were hit by the delightful smell of fresh basil. All I can say is \"The Kids are right.\"   Pho Sur bills themselves as a Vietnamese Asian Fusion restaurant.  I think that's a fair description. Their menu includes not only classic Vietnamese dished such as pho sur noodles and beef roll with lemon grass but also Chinese dishes like Mongolian beef and Kung Pao chicken, and Japanese entrees such as yakisoba and chicken katsu.  We find ourselves at Pho Sur at least once a month, many times with my mom and niece and/or the kids. So far we have always enjoyed a delicious meal at a very reasonable price.  My 83-year-old mother loves the beef roll with lemon grass. The son-in-law is partial to the beef with garlic and ginger. Daughter favors either the yakisoba or the mixed vegetables with peanut sauce. Depending on her mood, Herself orders the kung pao chicken or the beef roll with lemon grass. I am partial to their General Tao's chicken or the stir-fried meatballs with jalapeno and basil.   Since I usually get stuck with the bill, one of the things I love about Pho Sur is the price. Ninety percent of the entrees are $8 and there is nothing on the menu over $12. Herself and I can have a great meal for under 20 bucks. I don't know about you, but that's a big plus for me.  The service was a little spotty when Pho Sur first opened, but that can be expected with any start up. All I can say is we've had excellent service on every visit this summer.   Granted, Pho Sur is not on par with the great Asian restaurants of Seattle, Portland and San Francisco, but for the Southern Oregon, they are, in my humble opinion, one of the top ten best places for a great meal at a great price."}
{"text":"The Vietnamese Sandwich on the menu \"seems\" like it would be the Bahn-Mi sandwich that one who is familiar with Vietnamese cuisine would be. NOT!  For $8.00 you get a processed log of pork sausage, not the usual roast bbq pork, and mushy iceberg lettuce - the pre packed type (yuk!) - NOT the pickled vegetables, cilantro, and jalapenos that usually come with this type of sandwich...it was terrible.  Along with the sandwich you get a spring green salad, would be okay if it wasn't old and beginning to wilt.  The Fresh spring rolls (also $8!) are mostly made of the pre-packed shredded lettuce, you can count the number of noodles that are in the wrap - you can't even taste the shrimp.  Overall a disappointing experience since I was expecting to walk into an authentic Vietnamese / Asian restaurant.  The only perk is that I was refunded the cost of the spring rolls because I outright said it was disgusting....  Not sure I want to go back there again.  The processed pork sausage log did it for me!"}
{"text":"This place is getting better. Higher food quality, larger portions, better communication, and cleaner environment. My veggie pho was cooked perfectly with a large amount of steamed vegetables. I also enjoyed the fresh rolls with peanut sauce! So far so good!"}
{"text":"We just went to one of our favorite restaurants, Pho Sur, last night and we are afraid it may be closing. There was no wine displayed, there was no heat on, so we decided to take out pad Thai, which has always been delicious in the past. We got the house special that had two old pieces of shrimp in it two pieces of chicken and maybe 12 pieces of tofu. There were no peanuts at all, and no spices. I was afraid all night that I would wake up with food poisoning. Fortunately I didn't. Luckily we have Anya's in Ashland so we won't be missing good Thai food, and Tot's for pho. Too bad, Pho Sur's salmon used to be great. I think they must be in financial trouble and can't afford staff and fresh ingredients. Maybe the food channel could try to save them. Their food was so good in the past I gave it 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place used to be great but it's since gone downhill.  I'm not sure what happened but the pho is no longer worth the money."}
{"text":"I wanted Pho so bad!! So I lowered my expectations because of this being a small town and found this place. As a side note...I have a really hard time finding things to complain about when it comes to places or people... This was a hot disaster.... Straight outta Kitchen Nightmares.    When I walk In the place its hot, like 90 degrees hot. It's 80 degrees outside so I decide to sit outside. The waiter was to the point and didn't seem to be social or seem to care to talk or have a personality. I order the salad rolls. They are $7.99..... Yes you heard me. They must be great? For that price! The presentation was like a 3 year old wrapped these things and the vegetables were brown. Not fresh.   I asked for hot chili paste or hot sauces and he brings me a knock off Rooster sauce that's house made. I get up and ask if he has chili paste and he gives me a saucer of red pepper flakes.... Yes you heard me. Then the chicken pho I crave comes out. I was hoping this would be the savior of my lunch. The broth was murky... Like clam juice. The side of sprouts and jalapeños , few days past due.   Someone please save me from driving my car into a mountain!!"}
{"text":"Waitress seemed mad, noodle was over cooked, price is high.... As an asian, I'd go somewhere else, might be ok for others."}
{"text":"Really impressed... Good food. We had egg rolls and pad Thai and it was great friendly staff but be ready to hang out for a sec because its a little slow w service but worth the wait! Recommended for sure!"}
{"text":"Really good food.  Love their fresh summer rolls and their spicy udon noodle dish with jalapeno... service has improved since they opened and I have never had a bad experience with the food SO TASTY!"}
{"text":"Had the pho soup, could have used more flavor in the broth."}
{"text":"I'm totally bummed. This used to be one of my favorite places and after today's experience, I don't think that I'll be returning.   They hired a new chef who doesn't have a clue about what he's doing. I watched him shuffle around the kitchen and even ask the main woman (maybe the owner?), \"is this chicken cooked?\" Gross.  I ordered my usual, and it was awful. Quite a contrast from something I used to consider one of my favorite meals in the Valley! The tempura vegetables were gross. Super crumbly with excess batter that tasted of nothing but oil. The udon noodles in broth had small chunks of beef floating everywhere. As a vegetarian, you can imagine how put-off I was. I tried to scoop a little broth around the meat and it was so salty it made me cringe! Absolutely disgusting.   My boyfriend was given the wrong order, but the waitress insisted that, that's what he ordered. I asked about the meat in my soup and again, she just told me that, that's what I ordered. My boyfriend's pho was also so salty it wasn't edible. Truly sad to watch such a good place turn so awful because of one bad chef!  We paid full price for our salty/wrong orders and immediately went to Marie Callenders for something at least edible."}
{"text":"If I could give this 0 stars, I would.  Do not go here.  Before you read any of the other reviews, please note that according to Julia M., the current chef is NOT serving the same food as all of the 4 and 5 star reviews are about. I should have heeded her warning.  The food is absolutely AWFUL. I cannot say this enough. It is nearly inedible.   I ordered the special - spicy beef udon. Literally 4 minutes after I ordered (!) I had my food in front of me. We had waited another couple minutes for my wife's food to come.   Right off the bat, my dinner looked exactly like what you'd expect if you went to grocery outlet and got a frozen bag of \"asian\" food and threw it in the microwave. All of the vegetables were in huge chunks, the meat looked like re-hydrated shavings of Jack Links beef jerky, and the noodles were sticky and mushy. The taste? Well, it tasted of almost nothing. What little flavor it did have was from the obviously-from-frozen pieces of \"beef\" food matter which I can only describe as being like if you were to take all of the chunks of beef out of a soup can, rinse them off, and throw it in the microwave for 3 days. EXTREMELY dry, stringy and chewy. Also, for being called \"spicy udon\" there was no spice in it anything except for the 2 or 3 halves of jalapenos thrown in there.  My wife's dinner was just as bad. She had chicken with peanut sauce. The \"chicken\" was like overcooked dark meat chicken nuggets that had, once again, been left in the microwave for far too long. Hers also came with a medley of chunky mixed vegetables which did not complement the dish whatsoever. It's like they just have a bag of mixed vegetables they throw in everything they make so plates can leave the kitchen fast and they don't have to cut anything to order. On top of her pile of nuggets and veggies was a huge serving (HUGE) of melted peanut butter. This wasn't peanut sauce - it was simply melted peanut butter.  We listened to a table of older patrons asking for some new chicken - he kept saying \"This is frozen chicken... it's not good\" and the waitress/owner(?) kept telling him \"Oh no.... you should have ordered something else! That not good chicken! Next time you try something else!\"  Needless to say, after 1 or 2 bites each, we were done. We tried dousing our meals in the hot chili sauce that was left on our sticky table, but it couldn't mask the funk. The waitress came by to ask how everything was and we just flat out told her we didn't enjoy any of it. She did ask for criticism, so I began explaining to her the magnitude of just how bad the food was. Not 3 seconds after I start, she interrupts me and tells me we should have just ordered something else and next time to try something else.  We got the bill for our 5 minute \"dinner\" ~$22. I begrudgingly handed her my card and when she came back she said she had good news! \"Since you didn't like, I give you your Sierra Mist on the house. You are important to us and we hope you come again!\" Ohh... oh boy. The one thing we DID enjoy was the Sierra Mist.  I feel so ripped off and am actually shocked at how terrible it was.   Do. Not. Go. Here."}
{"text":"My one complaint is that the service is super slow...and not relaxing kick back it takes a few minutes slow, but SLOW enough to make me want to get up and total the check myself.   The pho was great, and I liked that there was some sort of smokier chili sauce that isn't something I see normally at my pho restaurants. Also enjoyed the salty warm edamame that we had as an appetizer.   I'm not in Oregon frequently, but if I am, I would drop by again to see if service was any different."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre, rice was served semi cold and their food taste like Chinese food.  Panda Express got more flavor and I hate Panda Express.  When we got there on Monday 9/30/13, there was no one there at all.  Some of their equipment wasn't working and we couldn't eat some dishes mainly because they can't fry anything.  2 stars because they save us time for not cooking, other then that I wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"I'm a pho snob originally from Seattle. I give the broth itself 2 stars. The meat was gross and I took it out of my soup and just ate the noodles and broth that was heavily doctored (by me) with the hoisin and hot sauce to try to improve the flavor. They only offer one size of pho as well: huge. Won't be returning. Plus side is the woman working was a sweetheart with an awesome outfit."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, after a few owner changes, this place has become a real dump.  NOT the same restaurant I reviewed in 2012--those folks are long gone.    My few times going back since the change have been aweful--product often times not available, no basil for my pho, etc.  Also, the place was filthy."}
{"text":"Like other folks have said when this place first opened, the Asian Fusion was the best in Valley. Sometime last year the restaurant was sold to new owners. They kept the same menu but the dishes are now made with low quality pre-made frozen products.   Unfortunately this was just set up a restaurant flip. The original owners, bring in a talented chef, top quality products, build up the clientele and then sell it to the highest bidder.   The restaurant now is completely run by a Chinese husband and wife team, no employees. So the service is poor as well.   My girl friend ordered a chicken dish, which came out with pre-cooked chicken squares. When we got home she open the freezer and pulled a bag out to show me."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill. It's been about a year since were last here and we won't be back. Pho stock is weak and beef pho came with chicken stock. Normally fresh looking bean sprouts and cilantro looked like it have been frozen and thawed and there wasn't any basil. Fresh rolls were ok-ish...and not happy about the extra charge for peanut sauce...that looked like and tasted like runny Jif soup. Server was nice though :)"}
{"text":"I called in last night around 8:25 to ask them when they close and when they stop taking take out orders. The lady told me they close at 9, but she would wait for me to come in.   I jumped in my car and arrived at the restaurant at 8:40. I saw one couple leave as I arrived, two ladies finishing their meal, and a man leaving with his to go order. I also noticed a man in the back as he finished washing dishes. The lady greeted me every so nicely, and took my order, as I paid another customer called to place an order, he was a regular.   Once she put our meal tickets to hang in the cooking area, the man came and started yelling at the lady \"Ahh! You know no what time we close!??!! I'm tired!! I no like it!!\"  The lady and I smiled and shared a little chuckle as I signed my receipt. I felt so bad I left her a $5 tip. This all happened by 8:47. By 8:52 PM, the man left the building; leaving the lady to cook and clean the whole restaurant by herself. She even tried telling him to quiet down because they still had customers and it was embarrassing for her and bad business. I felt so bad!!!   I grabbed the traditional Vietnamese dinner plate with egg rolls. It was so delicious! Not as delicious as the Vietnamese food I've enjoyed in LA. But for now, this will do. I will be back because I've also enjoyed their pad Thai, but again, don't go in there 45 minutes before they close."}
