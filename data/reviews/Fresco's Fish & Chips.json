{"text":"Simplicity is a virtue of life.  What can be more simple? 

Fish + Chips + Tartar Sauce

Freshco Fish and Chips does it right! 

They have two batter options, extra crispy(Ms. Vickies potato chips) and regular. If you're not certain which to go for, ask for one extra crispy and one regular.  

No problem!!

Poutine is a must eat! They make probably the best poutine in Toronto!! And their daily special of poutine and a pop for $5 is out of this world!!

The portions are huge!! 

Words don't do this place justice. If you have one of those cravings that needs to be satisfied, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I go here once in a while with my colleagues. I went there Yesterday for dinner.  The service is  fast and the fish is always fresh.   Oh my! my waist line goes up but satisfied with the meal overall.  Great portion size.   I am petite so most portion sizes I can not eat in one sitting.   Was not to happy with the fries.  I felt they must have either been old fries re fried or sitting there to long.  But the fish was fresh and crispy just how I like it.  I only wanted water after this meal because  adding pop would just be over the top for me."}
{"text":"Omg...so picture the kensington location but much bigger and there are washrooms! Lol! Honestly, everything was spot on. The shrimp po boy with sweet potato fries were amazing and the calamari had the perfect amount of seasoning. A little bit of crunch yet tender still. 

I'll also say there was plenty of seating and the place was super clean. A huge bonus was that the people working there were so kind. Very outgoing. My kids really took a liking especially to the lady in the front. Can't get better service then that. I love Kensington but this location blows my mind!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 years since I've been downtown for a date w/the hubby and where is the first place we go?! OF COURSE...FRESCOS!!! 
It's as amazing as I remembered it! I ordered the shrimp poboy with sweet potato fries and my hubby got the lobster poboy with regular fries. We of course splitted our poboys. 
The sweet potato fries were amazing. Crispy on the outside but tender inside and it paired perfectly with the chipotle sauce. And the shrimp poboy...mmm! Beautiful bread with just the perfect amount of filling and the JUICY SHRIMP!! I can't wait to come back soon. 
Oh and my hubby...he had to come back after a few hours to take some back home for dinner lol 

like I told Michael...YOU NEED TO MAKE A STORE IN SCARBOROUGH! We would be regulars for sure! 

Ps: the owner, Michael, is always so nice to his customers and really values them. It's nice to see that after all this time he still remembered us"}
{"text":"My favourite place to get poutine! It is super yummy, sizzling hot, & just enough to fill my stomach. Bonus, it's only $5 and it also includes a drink. As well, I have heard such great things about some other items on their menu. They have great staff, service, and food. What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of poutine then I would recommend coming here. This is the only place I've been to in Toronto thus far that puts a decent amount of cheese on poutine. And I am a fan of cheese. If you agree that there's never enough cheese on your poutine without you having to pay extra- and even then it's still not enough cheese- then this might be your place. 
I've also tried their fish and chips and they weren't bad. I wasn't particularly fond of the wings I tried but my friends liked it so it's a matter of preference and flavour.

{"text":"Skip the $1 extra crunchy Bucks batter option, it is just a few small pieces of  potato chips on top the batter. Doesn't taste anything special. Definitely does not worth the $1."}
{"text":"tasty fish and chipys.

just too much Beatles in the air. ;)"}
{"text":"Been to Fresco's a few times now.
Friendly service.  Beatles music. Limited seating.
Had the hailbut rolled with crushed Miss Vickie's chips......it works! light, tasty, crunchy
The fish is fresh, and the hand cut fries are yummy as well.  I always get them unsalted. Staff is accomadating to our needs.
One last positive note. it's always made to order!"}
{"text":"It's a small place primarily intended for take out.  There is technically a dining area but it is nothing more than a couple of tables in the corner between the cashier and the window. We ordered the halibut with Miss Vickies batter and poutine and were upsold on crab cakes which were on special that day.  We decided to stay there to dine, not wanting the fish to go soggy on the way back home.  Food was cooked to order and it was about 8 min for the order to be ready.  It was fresh and hot and tasty.  The halibut was the best part.  Poutine was good, but I suppose it's hard to screw up a mixture of carbs, gravy, and cheese.  The crab cakes, I suspect, were a frozen commercially prepared product and were just sort of average.

The girl at the front was friendly and helpful but unfortunately a couple of her friends arrived part way though our meal and we ended up having to listen to their conversation for the balance of the time.

All in all a good place. The fish is worth a return visit but next time it  will be take out."}
{"text":"Love it here. Fish and chips are solid, get the extra crispy! Staff are always friendly. Also, really been into the buffalo wings lately. So good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food, and even better service. Plus points for the amount of Beatles posters on the wall"}
{"text":"Finger lickin'good Wings! Awesome Fish and Chips ! And the Best Calamari on earth lol! 

Verdict: Must Come!"}
{"text":"Being from the west coast, I'm quite picky about my fish.  I usually prefer grilled fish, but it's difficult to find good grilled fish in Toronto so I decided to give Fresco's a try due to the excellent Yelp reviews.

It was so good.  I had the cod.  I have never had such great batter.  It almost seems to melt into the fish, like the batter and the fish were inseparable. While the batter was light and crispy, the fish was tender, moist, plump, and very fresh.  The quality of the cod was top notch.  

The grilled salmon, on the other hand, was overcooked and tough.  
The haddock tasted too fishy for me to enjoy.
I tried the Mrs. Vicky's batter and thought it was thick and gross, sorry.
The fries were bland and not crispy enough.  
The mozzarella sticks were tasty with good amount of cheese inside.
The fried mushroom caps were not good.  Thick batter and the mushrooms inside were bland with the weird sweet taste of the batter.

The place is small with 2-3 tables plus a bigger patio."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for fish and chips I always go to Harbord fish and chips for a few reasons:
They use halibut and you get two nice pieces of fish with fresh cut fries (you can see them cutting them right there) for $15 and they wrap it in newspaper so overall a legit place! 

I kept hearing about Fresco so I thought I had to check it out - the service was outstanding, the fella at the counter was friendly. We ordered 1 piece with fries which came to $16. 
The fish was okay but not that great - something about the oil they use didn't taste very well. Would I go back? Not if I can go to Harbord which in my opinion beats Fresco's any day! The fries were decent as well but not as good as Harbord, overall, I'd stick to Harbord."}
{"text":"A small food stop with patio provides delicious poutine and fish and chips. We order one Qubec style poutine and one Cod fish and chips. This is my first time eating poutine. Amazing, it's terrific. The deep-fried fish is also good with the sauce. The flavor of the small salad included in the box is then your lifesaver after eating too much fries. :-D"}
{"text":"Been here twice and loved the 'Miss Vickys' battered fish. I believe I tried haddock both times and I rarely eat fish.  The fish is freshly fried so its not greasy and the fries are very yum. The order comes with coleslaw which is decent but I'm always too full to finish it. 

Only downside is that its quite pricey for 'fish and chips' ($11.25 including the $1 extra from 'Miss Vickey's batter'). 
But the upside is that its big enough to share with a friend. Maybe add an  order of fish. 
Second upside is that all the containers are biodegradable!"}
{"text":"I never understood the hype about fish and chips. Everywhere I tried it before it was meh. Battered fish which was mediocre at best along with home style French fries. 

This was until I discovered Fresco's Fish and Chips...Their fresh selection of fish along with their tartar sauce is nothing less than awesome. Also I never knew tartar sauce could taste so good. The poutine is another story. I lived my life in Montreal and having now lived in Toronto for 11 years I can safely say that their poutine has been the best I've had on this part of the country. Montreal style. They got it right. 

Tip: Get the Haddock with poutine. Poutine is only about $0.50 extra than having the meal with fries. Thank me later :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on Canada's Day.  We both got the haddock fish and chips.   For $10.95 you get 2 pieces of fish.  We both enjoyed our food but couldn't finish it.  We realized we probably could have split a single order between us.  The fish and chips come with tarter sauce and a small portion of coleslaw.  I didn't really care for the coleslaw and threw mine out."}
{"text":"Ordered haddock fish and chips both trad and crispy! Love the crust- crispy not mushy! Fresh fish, coleslaw is my fav!! Fries are thick cut and just right. Will visit again !!"}
{"text":"So delicious when you're craving fish n chips...definitely satisfied our craving!  Ordered the halibut and the haddock - actually preferred the haddock with their Miss Vickie's extra cirpsy batter.  Loved the poutine - first bite was absolute heaven.  Service was fantastic and friendly.  Enjoyed sitting in the small patio outdoors on a nice spring day with all the eclectic mix of Kensington Market surrounding you."}
{"text":"Great fish & chips. The haddock was perfectly fried and piping hot as were the fries. Very friendly and customer oriented chef. Overall a great experience and best meal we had in Toronto."}
{"text":"After reading all the positve reviews I decided to try this place!

First of all i met the owner who was very friendly and informative. Ordered the Halibut and chips with the Mrs. Vickies batter, which he told me was cooked in some non-greasy oil. Actually the fish did taste very light which I'm not sure if it's a good thing as you expect fish to taste greasy. Kind of like having \"light\" tasting KFC...

The fish and chips was solid, the place was very cozy and chill and I would definitely recommend this place to friends!

Food: 4
Service: 5+
Ambience: 4
Overall: 4 of 5 stars  

*I would give this place 5 stars, unfortunately I have visited St.John's Newfoundland and have been spoiled with the most orgasmic fish and chips ever\""}
{"text":"Got the extra crispy piece of haddock, well done!  Decent size, fries were good, and the service was excellent.  Friendly guy, which I assume was the owner.  Bene here many times already, will definitely go back."}
{"text":"While in Toronto for a few days, I had a hankering for fish and chips.  The majority of other reviews are spot-on -- simply, very good fish and chips.  I had the cod with poutine and breaded mushrooms.  Based on the suggestion of the waitstaff, I tried both the extra crispy recipe in addition to the original recipe.   Definitely try the extra crispy.  Will repeat when back in town!"}
{"text":"They make the best fish and chips. Halibut and cod are both great. Seems like the only place that serves fresh fish and chips."}
{"text":"Called for a delivery, minimum $30 with a $5 delivery fee. Expressed exasperation about inability to generate an order this large from a fast food restaurant. I was told by the lady on the phone that \" it's not her business\" and \"you don't need to be such a jackass\". 
Thanks Fresco for trying to work with the local community. Sorry I tried ordering a delivery. I will never visit your operation again. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Small place a little out of the way compared to some other Kensington places. Good food and quite quick."}
{"text":"Fresco's Fish and Chips is a casual take-out in the heart of Kensington Market. The menu caters to both British and Canadian tastes, offering bettered cod, halibut, salmon, and haddock with chips alongside various poutine types. Fresco's also does chilli bowls and sandwiches. Being from the seaside resort of Brighton in the UK, I do sometimes miss a good battered cod, so I decided to investigate Fresco's claim to being \"the best fish & chips in town\" for myself. 

Although I was tempted by the salmon and chips, I ordered the classic cod and chips. My server encouraged me to try one of the two cod pieces with the crispy batter, an in-house favourite made from Miss Vickie's salt and vinegar flavoured crisps, which cost me $1 extra.


The Good: Everything was fresh and fast; my order was ready within minutes. The chips were hot, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The potato skins were left on, and they were delicious. The fish was tender and moist and came wrapped in newsprint-decorated lining, an affectionate nod towards the British tradition of serving fish and chips in newspaper.  There was an excellent selection of condiments, and the dish came with home-made coleslaw and tartar sauce. The two servers I interacted with were friendly and enthusiastic.

The Bad: The traditional cod was not crispy enough for my taste, and although the Miss Vickie's battered cod was crispier, the addition of the crisps was not worth the additional $1. The fish itself was too bland and could have benefitted from a thicker batter.

Overall: Judging by the quality of the chips compared to the quality of the fish, Fresco's might make a better poutine joint than a chippy. However, the service was excellent and the place itself, while small, was welcoming. Keeping with the British theme, the walls are adorned with Beatles paraphernalia and the same plays in the background. The speed of service means it's ideal if you're looking to grab a bite to eat on your way home.

The Crowd: Two families, a couple in their 20s, and some middle-aged people.

Pricing: $10.95-16.95 for various kinds of fish and chips, $2.98-9.50 for sides, $3.98- 10.95 for poutine varieties."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing.  Seriously the best fish and chips I've ever had.  Got the Halibut and a Poutine.  You will at first think it's pricey, but for the quantity and quality of the food, I was glad to pay it.

Oh yeh, and their Miss Vickie batter (they have two batters to choose from) is AMAZING."}
{"text":"This is by far the best fish & chips in Toronto! I been to nearly 15 fish and chips joints in Toronto and was on a mission to find the best. Well this was the 15th fish & chips joint and I don't need to even bother looking for any others. 

You can just go here for the fries and you'll be floored by just that alone, but put the fish in and well you'll be wanting seconds.

The batter on the fish really separated it from others."}
{"text":"BEST Fish & Chips in Toronto - HANDS DOWN!  There is only one other place that I would go to and now, I probably won't go there anymore!  Fresco's is IT!  It was a combination of the service, the owner and the food that makes it amazing!

The fries are hand-cut and delicious, coleslaw refreshing, and above all the FISH was incredibly amazing!  Not too greasy, batter is out of this world (trust me - go for the extra crispy!)  Price is beyond reasonable - even for the halibut (and again trust me, the haddock was delish!)  I can't wait to go back and try their crab cakes and the lobster bites....oh yeah and their poutine!

All in all, all I can say is 2 enthusiastic thumbs up and 5 stars from me!

Thanks!! :)))"}
{"text":"The BEST fish and chips I've ever had
INCREDIBLE wings (secret recipe he wouldn't share with me!)
and I LOVE Michael's passion for his food and his customers

You can only get this kind of food and passion with someone who loves what he does, and has such a positive and optimistic attitude toward life

Skip the cod and go straight for the halibut - extra crispy.  You won't regret it.  And the fries are unforgettable."}
{"text":"Great little place. Found it on yelp wanted some fish and chips. We came close to closing but no complaints they sat us and made us food. The fish and chips was perfectly cooked- juicy and flakey and crispy on the outside. Chips were like chip truck... my favourite. Hubby had Cod and I had haddock - both were good!"}
{"text":"This is based on my visit for their wednesday special for crab cakes...3pcs with fries and drink for $9 flat. After trying this...The fries were pretty alright, the type you can get at the food trucks on Queen... The crab cakes were not that great for me...Why, because it is not 'real' crab meat...Its imitation meat! You can taste the imitation, and its no wonder why you can get 3 pcs. Usually real crab meat and great quality without much bread crumbs, prob will not get 3 pcs...

Pros: Owner is very nice.
Con: The Cashier girl with the tattoo is not...

Next time will try their signature fish and chips, and maybe their lobster bites...since I see it on their online menu..."}
{"text":"It's good. Not my favourite fish and chips place, but it's up there. I'm giving it 4/5 stars solely based on the food. The place is super casual so I'm not judging the ambiance and decor, or even presentation skills. It's not a hole in the wall, but it's a tiny little take-out joint with like 6 seats. Maybe not the best place for a date, but if you're craving fish and chips and you're nearby, check it out!"}
{"text":"They put Miss Vickies chips in their batter!! I love them."}
{"text":"Came here cuz the GF was craving fish & chips.

Upon arriving saw that it is very 'cozy' seating. Very cozy. Luckily one couple was just leaving and we got a seat in one corner.

We both ordered the haddock (extra crispy for both as well) and chips and ordered onion rings and meat chili for sides.

There were 2 pieces of fish that were good portions. Fish was flaky and moist (night and day difference from the night before). Fries were the chunky type with skin on. Coleslaw was the creamy type, which I prefer, versus the vinegary kind.

Onion rings was not bad but not great but the dipping sauce was very good.

Chili tasted and looked homemade with large chunks of veggies and ground beef.

I would come back again but would aim for warmer weather when the patio is open for more seating.

Would have gotten 5 stars but there are no restrooms available. Somewhat understandable given the area and small restaurant but to direct your patrons to another business for restrooms is a shame.

Would recommend friends and family and people to give this place a try."}
{"text":"SUPER impressed with their customer service. We ordered for delivery through Just Eat and they called to confirm our order and gave us complimentary extra-crispy batter. The fish and chips are delicious and were still crisp and steaming when they arrived. Our side of fried pickles were some of the best I've had in town - hearty, crunchy wedges, perfect with the accompanying chipotle sauce. Recommended!"}
{"text":"- Great balance of batter and fish
- Friendly service
- Generous portion of fries
- Fish: Crips on the outside and moist on the inside


This is a must try!  :)"}
{"text":"I checked this place out because there was a group coupon deal going on ($10 for $20 of food) so I figure, hell, for a $10 lunch, what do I have to lose?

Turns out the place has a reputation for a reason.  I ordered the halibut with meat chili poutine.  The halibut was fried in two different types of batter, one having a slightly more crispy texture (you can request this).  Each order includes coleslaw, lemons and tartar sauce to add flavour.  The fish were crispy and not at all dry on the inside, and the fish did not taste greasy, it was done just right.

The fries were good, definitely better than your run of the mill fast food joint.  I haven't had poutine in a while so I can't compare, but it's definitely not bad at all here.  

Owner is friendly and willing to chat up a bit with you, so that's always a plus, and getting my food quickly and properly done is always huge.  I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I ate the halibut and chips and wouldn't really recommend it - it tasted like fried potatoes. But the tartar sauce and fries were good. And the service was good."}
{"text":"Had the haddock, one piece with the extra crispy chip batter, one original. Tasted great, tons of fries. Not sure I'd pay what they're asking for the halibut but I'll be getting the haddock again"}
{"text":"Now I'm originally a Brit, so the one thing that we take seriously is our fish and chips. Too many of the fish and chip joints in this city are lackluster. Fresco was the first place to really make me think I was getting a piece of home. 

We ordered the cod and chips (2 pieces for $11.95! A great price for Fish and Chips in the city of Toronto) as well as the lobster po boy. The fish was amazingly crisp on the outside, giving way to a tender and meaty (what an oxymoron) core. The chips were crispy on the outside, a lovely golden brown and tasted like potato on the inside (I know it's a strange thing to say but there are so many chips in this city that don't even taste like the vegetable it came from!). 

The coleslaw is crisp and refreshing (it's so good that even I, someone who loathes most coleslaws, decidedly wiped it clean). 

The meal was so great we ordered an extra sandwich for good measure; the shrimp po boy. While my partner couldn't decide which sandwich was better (shrimp or lobster) I am firmly in the shrimp camp. It's made with the Ms. Vickies extra crisp batter (lives up to its name) and is just a burst of flavourful goodness. The shrimp are pretty large too; none of that sad mini stuff that some places serve. That isn't to knock on the lobster which comes with large crunches of lobster, I'm just a sucker for shrimp. 

The atmosphere just wraps up the food experience in a great way. The staff are super friendly. They know how to take care of their regulars, and they know how to welcome new comers whether it's with a cute little anecdote, or discussing the tunes that they play in the shop (we got to request a track which totally made our day). 

As my partner said it's got a small town feel in a big city. If you want the chance to feel a genuine human connection while eating amazing classic food; this is your place."}
{"text":"The place was great. I had extra crispy halibut with poutine. The fish tasted amazing and was fresh. The owner was very friendly.

The only downside is that they only have three tables so you might have to wait for a seat. 

Definitely the best fish and chips I've had downtown!"}
{"text":"Fresco's was recommended to me by some locals when I told them I wanted to try poutine.  It was top notch!!!!!  The owner was extra nice.  He came out and talked to me while I waited for my food, and then came out of the kitchen again when I was done to see what I thought!  I'm only sorry I didn't have more time to go back and try the fish and chips!"}
{"text":"This place has been a fixture in Kensington for a long time and is ALWAYS on point. Ordering can be a little chaotic as you have bike courier orders being lined up with those who are dining at the restaurant itself. The lineup easily extends outside which makes it difficult for in/out through 1 door. 

There isn't a ton of indoor seating space but who cares when you have a decent sized patio outside that is perfect for people watching in this unique hood.

The fish selection is pretty standard but they are battered lighter than other places. The batter is really only there for decoration as you can easily peel the batter off and get at the soft, delicious fish. The fries are also outstanding and the entire meal isn't overly greasy and oily. Kinda makes you feel like you're eating at one of the health(ier) F&S shops in the city."}
{"text":"Have ordered from Fresco's for delivery a few times and oh dear Lord it's good!  I could tell you all about how fantastic the various dishes we've tried are, but look kids: everything's good.  And awesome sweet potato fries too.  And great delivery guys.  Staff very friendly on the phone.  All in all, it doesn't get better."}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love this place! It was quite random of us to head over here..I read reviews about this place and wanted to bring my boyfriend here as he enjoys some good fish and chips..Its this small place in Kensington Market with a bright blue sign.
We walked in and were greeted by two friendly staff members and one of them was the owner..He asked if this was the first time we have ever been here and we stated yes. He recommended some options including trying his famous miss vickies battered fish..so we had one regular battered and the other miss vickyfied..We also ordered a lobster poy-boy..
Its a small place probably able to sit about 10-12 people but when the weather is nice, the patio is opened as well..
The owner brought us our food and we unwrapped the box of goodies..and omg, it was the best fish and chips I had ever had..I really enjoyed the miss vickies as it gave the fish a bit more crunch..mm..the fries, absolutely delicious-or the chips i might say..authentic, chunky fries which were not too crispy but had the right texture! My boyfriend loved the poy-boy..it was yummy and it had a delicious chipotle mayo to add to it..He said that their fries were the best he ever had! 

Afterwards, we spoke to the owner and he wanted to know our opinions of the fish..i thought that was a really nice touch and he seems to remember previous customers names and orders..I really liked that.

Definitely come here-prices are reasonable and the food is just simply amazing!
Staff are very warm and friendly and they just make you feel at home.
We will definitely be back when we are craving some good ol fashion fish and chips.
YUM!"}
{"text":"If you want good old-fashioned fish and chips, go here, ask for the extra-crispy (costs $1 extra) and ENJOY. I ordered the cod version and thought it was some of the best I've ever had. The batter was so crispy AND light, and fish was perfectly flaky inside. It was served with good (above-average) fries and a solidly delicious tartar sauce. I was very happy! I gave the chef a speechless thumbs up (with my mouth full of food), and he thanked me about five times and seemed so pleased... Very sweet. 
Maybe there are better fish-and-chips somewhere in North America, but I am an experienced fish-and-chip eater, and these are my new favorite."}
{"text":"\"YELP!  I need somebody...YELP!  Not just anybody!\"   If you are an adoring fan of the rock group \"The Beatles\" (as I am) and also enjoy partaking in Ye Olde Britishe \"Fish and Finger Pies\" than this is just the \"The Beatles\" themed restaurant for you.  As far as Fish n' Chips go, this place is Rock n' Roll.  The batter is handmade by local potato farmer and micro-brewer Vickie Kerr (the \"Miss\" in \"Miss Vickie's Chips\" !!!)  The fish itself was a whitefish and was moist and lake-fresh.  The french fries were salted perfectly.  The entire dish is wrapped in authentic newspapers from Liverpool and served with a piece of lemon, shredded cabbage salad and a crunchy mayonnaise sauce.  The music they play?  You guessed it gov'nah... It's \"The Beatles!  Pretty much the best!  I guess it's not such a big deal, but one of my only complaints would be that I think it would be cool if the staff were to be dressed in St. Pepper's uniforms or something... or at least had mop- top wigs.  Also, they do not serve ales or spirits of any sort, which made the \"pub grub\" experience slightly odd for me.  Will I be back to Ye Olde Fresco's?  Elementary my dear Ringo!"}
{"text":"So we finally went back to Fresco's and I'm so glad we did. I hadn't been in a hurry to go back because I didn't feel like it was all that special the first time around but it seems they've either upped their game, or my last experience wasn't the norm. Either way, this meal was really, really enjoyable.

This time we ordered the chips, cod, chili, and the haddock. There may have also been a poutine! The cod was incredible. I immediately regretted our not ordering two, because I was really sad I didn't have my own piece. I think we arrived in time for a fresh batch of chips too. They were crispy on the outside and lovely and soft and potatoey on inside. Not too thin either. 

The chili was a nice addition to the menu, I thought, and a great break from the battered burger/battered sausage/battered anything, that I'm used to back in Ireland. When you don't want fish, it's nice to have something that isn't ten times heavier as an alternative.

The difference on this visit compared to the last was like night and day. I think I might need to go back a third time to really be sure...

Oh, and as an aside, just like last time, the staff and service at this place was amazing. They're so friendly, and so nice. I'm glad the food this time was just as good!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing. This quickly became our favourite fish and chips joint in the city, for so many reasons:

1. Fish AND chips are delish. It's so disappointing when you get iffy fries with yer fish!
2. The miss vickies chip batter (for a $1 charge), for when you're feeling extra decadent. 
3. Some sustainable fish options (the proprietor is open about what they can get sustainably, and when). 
4. Absolutely delicious po'boy sammiches. If you've been sticking to the fish n chips only, you are missing out, my friend. My fave is the shrimp (huge battered shrimps!) and the bf's is the lobster (smallish fried lobster-roll style bits). 
5. A variety of poutine options including vegan poutine! 
6. Mini fish & chips is a great deal if you're feeling a bit less hungry. 
7. Friendly service and Beatles tunes on rotation (usually - at least when the super-friendly owner is working). 

Anyway, there is clearly already tons of well-deserved love for Fresco's here but I'd be remiss if I didn't chime in. Go eat! :)"}
{"text":"Was brought here about a week ago, on vacation, and left very satisfied. The woman working the counter was friendly and offered to make one of our pieces of cod extra-crispy (with salt & vinegar chips in the batter). Not only was it tasty, but everything was in large portions, and there was coleslaw to boot! This was a nice change for me, because fish & chips elsewhere usually seem overpriced."}
{"text":"Fantastic fish and chips for fantastic portions. I stopped by some time ago to take advantage of the free drink with the yelp check-in. The store has wifi - which was a surprise - so you can chech-in on location. The owner even gave free samples of the Miss Vickie's extra crispy batter for my two friends. I myself had my order of haddock with the extra crispy batter, allowing for a generous dousing of malt vinegar without losing the crispy texture. My only concern with this place is the very limited seating area indoors. Only 8 people or so can sit inside at 2-3 tables."}
{"text":"Everything was really tasty.  Fish was crispy and not too greasy, fries were perfectly crispy too.  coleslaw, just right.  he has a spice sprinkle which is tasty on the fries.  didn't try it on the fish though.

The owner is really friendly.  A big Beatles fan, there are posters of the Beatles, adorning the wall and covers of the Beatle''s songs were playing.  My friend who was with me, is a big Beatles fan and recognized it right away.  So, English band in a fish and chips shop, I like when a resto plays music native to it's roots.

Nice clean atmosphere, yep, like to eat in a clean place."}
{"text":"Miss Vickies batter for the win! Seriously, you don't want to miss out on that. Overall, fish and chips done well."}
{"text":"The place from outside may not look pretty but the food was amazing.  We recommend the traditional battered fish.  We cant say enough about how great our haddock was.  The owner came outside to talk to us while we were enjoying the rush of people outside.   He was extremely nice.  Although you may want to order a lot based on the good prices, you should stick to one serving as its quite filling."}
{"text":"Food was quite pricey, but it was also delicious.

Can I say that this was the best fish and chips place i've ever been to? No.

But was it good? Heck ya!

I had two pieces of halibut and some coleslaw. Nothing really to expand on except the fact that it was really good."}
{"text":"Felt like getting fish and chips one night and I had read a lot of positive reviews about this place so decided to give it a try.

The owner was the only one there working and he was super friendly.  The food itself wasn't the best fish & chips I've ever had (i got the halibut and chips), but was pretty good, and I would go back purely based on the great service."}
{"text":"Faaaaantastic! High quality f&c here, and amazing poutine too. Fresh ingredients, good service... ummm... nope, nothing bad to say!"}
{"text":"Got the 2 pieces of cod and fries combo. Fish was fresh and very crispy but nothing spectacular. Fries were okay? Not sure what else to say."}
{"text":"Just excellent fish and chips; not greasy, full of flavour. Good fresh coleslaw, but not as generous a serving as there is of everything else -- next time I'll order an extra one. This is a proper fish and chips place: unfancy, cheerful. Beatles posters!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place based on the reviews from Yelp, and was really happy I did! It was amazing, some of the best fish n chips I've had. We got the haddock & chips and shrimp & chips, and changed one of the regular fries to sweet potato fries. The haddock was perfectly battered and crispy, and the shrimps were large and tasted really fresh. Both the regular fries and sweet potato fries were amazing, exactly how I like them (cut thick, I'm not a fan of thin fries). Also, nothing tasted greasy, everything tasted perfectly crispy and fresh! The owner is also really friendly! (and thoughtful - while we were eating my bf got a business call, and the owner noticed and immediately lowered the volume of the radio!) I'll be back to try the poutine and crab cakes!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for lunch a few days ago and was not disappointed. The restaurant has a nice, casual feel to it with a cash register in the front where you can pay and place your order. The indoors seating is a little cramped but thankfully there is also a patio area, which overlooks the quaint Bellevue Square Park.

 I got the haddock and chips with the regular batter and she got the crab cakes and chips. The crab cakes (there were three) were quite large and tasty. My haddock was fried to perfection. Not too greasy and just the right degree of flakiness. Both our meals came with a VERY generous potion of chips. The chips were also very tasty and had a nice texture to them. This is definitely a restaurant I'll be wanting to return to in the future, next time I hope to try out the lobster bites and chips which is found on the menu on the site, however it wasn't on the menu in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I can't say enough amazing things about this place.  I found it years ago during pedestrian Sunday and I'm hooked.  The fish and chips with the extra crispy batter is outstanding, no limp batter here.  Ask for their spicy dipping sauce with your fries, you won't be disappointed.  Their shrimp po boy is the best I have ever had and their crab cakes are quite good as well.  

I was in London a year ago and went looking for the best fish and chips, fresco tops anything I had there."}
{"text":"This place is similar to Buster's Sea Cove at St. Lawrence Market.  Came here for quick bite while browsing around Kensington Market one day.  Ordered 2 pieces of haddock & chip.  Lady with tattoo has nice spirit and attitude, which is a plus even before the food is tasted.  Everything is made to order so there is a short wait, but not long.  The fish is nicely seasoned and batter, crisp outside yet tender inside.  I am glad they didn't over fry it.  I don't feel much for the fries and coleslaw as they taste the same as any other place.  The portion is big tho and I didn't finish the fries.  I would say this is good for what it is, fast food fish & chip joint."}
{"text":"Visited Fresco's during a nice sunday walk. 
The small room inside was a bit crowded but we were able to find a seat to enjoy our meal. It was fresh and very good.

we ordered halibut and cod. Since it was our first time there, the owner offered us to try both type of coatings: regular (eggs, flour and bred crumbs) and special (regula plus crushed chips). The special was way better, the chips gave an extra crunchy layer.
The fish was very well cooked and tasty. the fries (we got regulars) were crunchy but a bit too oily (and they lacked seasoning). Overall it is a great place to visit in the Kensington market area. It is relatively cheap.

As a side note: The owner was very nice and friendly, service amazing. SUPER PLUS for their delivery service: they use bikes!!! yes, bikes!. it is faster, cheaper and your food doesn't get cold because of traffic. A negative note is the fried oil small due to the small size of the room."}
{"text":"I been dying to try this place after reading all the awesome reviews.

I had the lobster bites and chips, and, my husband had the halibut and sweet potatoes combo. Love it. Great fries. Great fish. Great bites.

The owner seems like the nicest guy and passionate. He was talking to a patron about the type of oil he uses and how often he changes the oil to keep the taste clean. You gotta love that!"}
{"text":"The poutineeeeee was great ! Excellent customer service from the guy with the reaally long hair . He was awesome . Got exactly what I wanted and it was just overall a really good experience . Kind of reminds me of Chippy's across trinity bellwoods park but Fresco's tastes better haaandsdown"}
{"text":"Fantastic Fish and Chips. Great staff... call ahead and they'll have it waiting."}
{"text":"We (2 friends and I) ordered both Haddock and Cod.. We all agreed that we enjoyed the haddock more than the cod. But both tasted great and LOADED with fries, which would make you full. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Bought the cod & chips. Doulble crispy worth $1. Nice coleslaw and tartar(my girlfriend loves it). TRY THE POUTINE, the gravy is great with beans and cheeses, and it's spicy ahhhhh...soooo good."}
{"text":"I totally love fish & chips and tend to be picky about places I go to. I came here last Summer during a getaway weekend, they have cute wooden benches and tables on a patio at the front. It was absolutely delicious. Very fresh and cheap fish, and the lady was very nice and helpful in recommending what fish I should have.

I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"The fish and chips were good... But not AMAZING. 
the fish was fresh. service was great. 
get the double crispy. it's awesome. 
the fries were so-so.
the coleslaw was good too. 
def come back for lunch"}
{"text":"Not many establishments like Fresco's have a Yelp score higher than 4 stars and over 100 reviews.  So I wanted to check out what all the fuss was about especially with so many Yelpers claiming that Fresco's has the best fish and chips in town. 

Fresco's has a cool Beattles vibe to it as memorabilia grace the walls and Beattles classics play in the background of this cozy spot in Kensington Market.

Patrons can select cod, haddock or halibut as part of their fish and chips combo and each combo comes with 2 pieces of fish, fries, coleslaw, a slice of lemon and tartar sauce.  There is also an option to order the fish extra crispy which entails having Miss Vickie's chips incorporated into the original batter - ingenious!

In addition to fish and chips, Fresco's also offers poutine, chili, seafood po boy sandwiches, chicken wings, and an assortment of sides ranging from deep fried pickles to mozzarella sticks. 

The halibut combo was ordered with extra crispy batter and it came in white box that disassembled easily at each side which was perfect for sharing. The halibut was wrapped with a classic newspaper print and sat atop a mountain of fries. 

The chip batter on the fish was a fantastic creative touch.  It was crispy and wasn't too oily.  Unfortunately, the fish was not moist and flaky as one would imagine.  It was nice of Fresco's to give out three pieces for this particular order since two of them were noticeably smaller, but to be honest, these pieces didn't taste as good because the batter to fish ratio was too high.  So it was a disappointing visit to Fresco's.  Perhaps it was because the halibut was ordered over the traditional cod and haddock variations?  Regardless, the \"best in the city\" fish and chips claim is unjustified.  There are comparable places in the city if not better.

So why the return visit?  

Was it because of the free drink with any fish and chips combo with a check in on Yelp?

No... it was because the fries were so tasty!  They were these fat, fleshy fries with skin on them.  They would be perfect served as part of a poutine!


The $5 (taxes in) poutine and drink special was ordered.  First of all, what great value!  The poutine was a sight for sore eyes!  It was so beautifully crafted.  Piping hot steam radiated out of this poutine and the fries soaked up the rich and flavourful gravy.  Admittedly, the cheese curds were a bit cold when the poutine was first served up, but they became gooey and stringy!

The poutine was a perfect example of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.  Yes, Aristole is being quoted... but it was just that good!  It was an amazing hodgepodge of flavours - a delicious mess!

The poutine rivals the likes of Smoke's and Poutini's House of Poutine.  I will definitely be back if not for the fish and chips but for the poutine! 

On a Yelp score of 5, this place is 3 for the fish and chips but gets a bump up to 4 for its poutine!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how none of the reviews for fresco's refer to their boneless wings.....unlike many other establishments these guys actually sauce them up (generously) in front of you and will make any of their favours hot/spicy if you ask them to....did I mention it tastes like real chicken? Bbq+hot is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Check in here and you get a free drink :) best fish and chips I've had so far, also the staff was friendly"}
{"text":"Okay, I must admit it, I love really good fried food. I had the extra crispy cod. It was delicious.  Unless Wolfgang Puck is a personal friend that invites you over for dinner, I'm not sure where you can do any better. As an added pleasure, the staff (owner?) was extremely pleasant.  My only complaint is they don't serve unsweetened ice tea. But I'm not sure anyplace in Toronto does?  (WTF?). 

Anyway, go to Fresco's if you like fish and chips!"}
{"text":"Well I was back again (I think it was July 28th, 2013) with a friend to Fresco's and it was another great visit. This time it happened to be a Pedestrian Sunday in Kensington Market, and I had no idea that would be going on. It made for a perfect relaxing Sunday of sitting on Fresco's little patio, while listening to some local bands in the background and people-watching on the street. We were there around 2:30 - 3:00-ish in the afternoon. 

There was a kiosk out front serving crab cakes; but we headed straight inside to place an order off the regular menu. My friend ordered the cod and chips with one piece in each batter, and I ordered shrimp and chips doing half the order in each kind of batter.

The man running the cash came out to tidy up the tables and sat down to have a chat with us for a bit and see how things were going (and maybe to escape the heat from the kitchen).

The shrimp were plump and juicy. In fact I had to give one away and leave some fries behind. Again everything was crispy, indicating good maintenance of the fryer oil and high temperatures."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place on yelp, so I decided to try it out one hot hot summer day. It's a little hole in the wall with limited seating inside and a small front patio. I got the haddock and chips for $10. The fish tasted extremely fresh. It was two small pieces of haddock served on a tall order of fries. The batter was nice and crispy, but light. They have the option of getting their extra crispy batter, but I just decided to try their \"traditional\" batter since it was my first time there. No regrets! The fish was served with a side of coleslaw and tartar sauce. Absolutely delicious! I couldn't finish all my fries however, but they were pretty good as well. Definitely can't wait to go back here :)"}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken sandwich and fries from Uber eats. It arrived quickly and was delicious. Fries stayed surprisingly crispy even though they were in a closed container. And really good hand cut fries, not too much salt. Sandwich was perfectly tender and moist, really tasty slaw and mayo. Only wish it was cheaper, but the quality is great."}
{"text":"We came by on Saturday afternoon and the place was pretty empty. We got the 2 piece haddock with a side of calamri. The guy at the counter was friendly enough, he even offered us the extra crispy (battered with miss vickies) on the fish for free.. which was really nice.. But what i didn't like was that he prefaced that he was going to give it to us for free by saying that he thinks there was a \"language barrier here\" so he will just \"try\" to explain what it (the extra crispy) is to my partner, who ordered.. (by the way, I was standing right next to him and i'm a native English speaker). My partner speaks and understands English just fine, he just has a bit of an accent. While i think he did it with good intentions (i.e. here's free food), commenting on his language ability based on his accent was a bit offensive and definitely unnecessary.

Anyway, on the food -- it was okay, nothing to write home about. Everything was freshly fried, which was nice."}
{"text":"Yummy! I enjoyed the fish more than a popular spot just east St Clair and there was a great portion of fresh cut yummy fries but not so much that we were throwing them out (like said other fish place). Coleslaw and tartar sauce were good, great variety on the menu. Yummy sandwich, too!"}
{"text":"Went here hoping for good things but was disappointed. I ordered the halibut and it was overcooked and was very dry.  As well, the food is served in a plastic basket with plastic utensils. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Loved every moment of it. They couldn't have had a better location than in the heart of Kensington Market. The food! It was realllly good, I got extra crispy with Miss Vickis batter. mmm and a Quebec style poutine. No worries I didn't eat it all on my own, however I was totally capable of doing so, nevertheless it was absolutely delicious comfort food. It's definitely the best place for Fish and Chips in the T dot."}
{"text":"Ordered the haddock and lobster bites over poutine.  Really thought it would be a hit from the pictures.  But my fish and chips appetite wasn't satisfied.  =(. My first poutine experience and I have to say it was ok.

However, I have to say everything was super fresh and prepared well.  The battered haddock became soggy very quickly and wasn't tasty enough.  The lobster bites were nice but not for the price. 

And maybe poutine just isn't for me."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  The extra-crispy halibut was tender and flavorful, served screaming hot and not greasy at all. The staff was friendly, the seating is limited and mostly outside but the neighborhood has a lot of character."}
{"text":"I once got sick from having their fried food.. It could be so much better if they know how to manage their kitchen clean and use fresh cooking oil since every food is fried.."}
{"text":"1: Poor
2: OK
3: Good
4: Very Good
5: Excellent

Haddock (4/5)

-It was light and fresh.  But it was sooo small.  

Poutine (1/5)

-The curds were not melted at all which is the whole point of poutine.  Fries were good.  Crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  The gravy was rich.  But the curd were cold on top.  I am not a fan of poutine.  And the first time I had it was at Pied de Couchon.  

Cream Soda from Pop Shop (1/5)

-Taste like cherry medicine and not very bubbly.

My husband thought the fish was greasy and small.  He had the halibut. And he thought the fries were burnt.  He complained all throughout the meal.   

Overall, my experience at Fresco's was flat.  I think they played 3 ACDC songs during my visit.  And the music was on the loud side.  Limited seating inside - only 3 tables.  We had to sit outside and it was a bit cool.  The fish & chips was good, but not the best in the city.  Expensive for what you get.  I have had better."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! The owner was helpful and friendly and the food was hot, fresh, and delicious! I had the salmon and chips (w/ the Vickies batter) and my buddy got the lobster bites and chips. We also got some crab cakes and mozzarella sticks. Everything was amazing. Next time I'm in Toronto I'll have to go back for sure. If you like seafood, especially fish & chips, you owe it to yourself to check out Fresco's.

To Fresco's: Goodbye, and thanks for all the fish!"}
{"text":"We tried the poutine at Fresco's for the first time because of Joylister's Poutine Passport Festival.  We were huge fans of the poutine!  The fries were made just right, they still had the crispiness that you want your fries to have in a poutine because it needs to maintain it's form and taste while being soaked in gravy.  The fries, together with the gravy and cheese curds were delicious!    A friend ordered the fish & chips and she also loved it!  I had a bite of it as well and it was indeed pretty delicious. The fish was juicy and flavourful, because sometimes fish loses its flavour after it's been deep fried. The batter was made with Miss Vickie's chips!   

It's more of a take-out place and they got pretty busy with take-out orders from when we got there at 5:30 to about 6:30pm.  The owner was super friendly and made sure we liked our food, definitely an A+ for both service and food."}
{"text":"Must Try: Fish and Chips! Halibut is my personal preference, but the cod is great too. If you're adventurous, try the version with Miss Vickey extra crisp batter. 

Rating: (10/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (8/10) Ambience, (8/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness

My Experience: 

Been coming here for years, and I don't think I'll stop anytime soon. I don't often give five stars, but when I do, it's for the Best of Toronto. A lot of times, there's more hype than substance behind highly rated restaurants, but Fresco lives up to the hype. Plus the non-stop Beatles hits are a great touch. 

The fish is always fresh, and has the perfect balance of batter each and every time. Everything is made to order, so it does require a wait, but the wait is worth it. If they have a special soup of the day, and it's Clam Chowder, get that too. 

Hidden away in Kensington Market, where there are a great handful of amazing joints, this is hands down the best fish and chips in the city. Note that there isn't much seating room inside, although there is a patio for seating in the warming months of the year. Overall, great service, and delicious food."}
{"text":"Got delivery. Food came quick, hot and delicious!! Will definitely order again, Yum!!"}
{"text":"The proprietor must be the nicest guy ever. I got both the extra crispy and the regular. Personally, I prefer the regular. The fish comes out crisp, pillowy and fresh. This guy's fish game is on point. 5/5 would return."}
{"text":"I love coming here for fish and chips every now and again. It's so bad for you, but it tastes so good! You can also have your fish battered with Miss Vickie's crumbs, if you so desire. Absolutely fantastic fish and chips, and not too expensive. There is also a small patio out front so you can people watch as you eat."}
{"text":"I got the 2 piece haddock with fries, slaw and tartar sauce. 

5 star for how crispy the fish was. BUT the fries were soggy and I received only one tiny container of tartar sauce for all this food... ended up eating the remainder of my meal with no tarter sauce.

The fish was too greasy AND So were the fries. I had severe stomach ache 2 hours after eating. The oil seeped through the cardboard box and was dripping out of it if you're wondering how greasy it was.

I don't know if I would come back again. You get 2 small pieces of haddock and an entire box of soggy fries. Probably not worth $20 with tax."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with my friend for a late lunch. After having walked around town for hours, ending the outing by eating some delicious food is my favourite part. 

We walked into Fresco's and it was a small cosy little spot, my friend ordered the cod and chips and I had the fish sandwich. When the orders came out I was very surprised at the quantity, it's a lot of food. My friend liked her fish but wasn't to happy with the fries, same for me. I felt the fries were a bit overcooked and not that great. My sandwich seemed to have too much coleslaw which over powered the fish, also it seemed to lack seasoning (ended up being too sweet from the slaw and needing some salt). 

Overall it's a great quantity for the price but I've had better."}
{"text":"Peeps know what I have to say about ONT fish&chips. The fish batter in this neck of the woods isn't \"wrong\" per se. But man alive, if you ever get out Nova Scotia way, your world will be altered. For the batter! yuk yuk yuk.

This place, much like so many fish and chips joints in the city is a totally passable place to grab a bite. The fish is well done and the batter isn't going to make you throw a hissy fit or anything. It's perfectly respectable deep fried haddock. What does set Fresco's apart from other places are the fries which are well salted with a hint of green. They are truly delicious, well fried, skins on, bold french fries that are worth the trek alone.

It's a hole in the wall obviously, and you'll want to sit out on the curb in the sun to eat out of the newspaper wrapping, but if you're in Kensington you're a real goon if you're expecting anything else.

All in all, it is the epitome of \"A-OK\". Not great but not too bad. Totally middle of the road."}
{"text":"One of the best Fish and Chips place in Toronto, if not the best. It's self service. So walk in order from the menu off the wall; pay for your order and grab a seat. They'll bring your order to you when it's ready. Both the chef as well as the cashier are super friendly. 
A tip - get the extra crispy fish instead of regular. It's great."}
{"text":"(Late post) No A/C in this place was tough! Really nice gents working there. Updated you on the progress of your order. The fish was very tasty. Not too much batter to fish ratio. Fries were tasty too. Definitely could have done with a smaller portion. Snack size for the menu perhaps"}
{"text":"I got the Cod and Chips. 

This place was delicious! I loved how there was actual FISH in between the batter of their fish (especially compared to some of the other bigger guys around the city which I've been to before to see nothing too special, sorry to say...)

Quality and quantity are definitely both apart of this place, and for the $12 I paid, a definite win. The fish was beyond delicious. I'd get extra fish if I could.

I also enjoyed how the owner was actually present working there alongside everyone else, and genuinely seemed to care about how we enjoyed the food.

Good feels all around.

Heads up on the tight seating inside, esp if you're wanting to go during a colder month.
I would defintely go back. Multiple times. This place is a keeper."}
{"text":"Get the shrimp and chips! 

This place never disappoints. The staff is friendly and everything I've had on their menu has been delicious. Great atmosphere too. Sitting outside on their patio in the summer is great!"}
{"text":"So I was looking for a fish and chips place near my house so where else do I turn to? YELP! That's right! This place is value for the food and much better than chippys! Chippys is about $5 more expensive and not even as close as tasty! You get a free pop with a check in on yelp as well! My girlfriend changed her fries for a poutine and it tasted good as well! I gave this place a 5 star because when you think about fish and chips it doesn't really get better than Freshcos!"}
{"text":"Super delicious fries and lobster po boy!! And so cheap especially considering how delicious it was. Everything about the sandwich was amazing from start to finish: the sauce, the bun, the fried lobster bites. The decor is really cool too, feels like a oceanside restaurant."}
{"text":"So seems my hunt for the best fish and chips in Toronto is still ongoing as it is not going to be this place.

I read that some of their other items are actually good but if your main selling point is fish n chips then I expect much better.

Okay so I ordered the cod and chips and asked that to eat in. The seating in this area is very limited and the place maybe more geared towards getting people to take their food away with them.

Got my order in a brown box on a tray combined with lame plastic knife and fork. Made it difficult to even eat the stuff out of a box.

The cod itself reminded me of something I would buy from the supermarket, two pieces of rectangular cod which made me question whether it actually was just bought from the supermarket and chucked in a fryer.

The chips - CRAP! How hard is it to cut some decent chunky chips and put them in the fryer, why all this fries shaped rubbish? 

Since they failed on the one thing I was expecting to be great I have absolutely no reason to go here again and there is no point being good at other menu items if your main selling point is not up to scratch.

Seriously really disliking the chips/fries thing going on at all these fish n chip places as that is half the experience.

There is place in Hamilton that does it good but just can not remember the place name."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in Toronto. They've got the tar tar sauce packets which is a huge bonus for me cause I always prefer them over the homemade kind, and not so many places use them."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent customer service! The batter mixed with muss Vickie's were amazing. Definitely going back again."}
{"text":"This was our third dinner in Toronto.  We were hungry and, after two okay dinners, we were hoping for excellent.  Fresco's did not disappoint!!  Among the members of our party, we ordered the cod, halibut, haddock, and shrimp and chips.  Everyone was impressed with the freshness and both traditional and extra-crispy batters.  Thank you for a great Toronto culinary experience!  (And thank you fellow Yelpers!)"}
{"text":"Yummy lobster sandwiches ! Wish they could've been bigger though. But I'm a hungry girl who eats a lot."}
{"text":"We ordered a couple of haddock's after a long bike ride and it was absolutely splendid. Simple, crispy, fresh, I don't know what more you need."}
{"text":"Hands down the best fish and chips in the country!!! Add the miss Vicki's to your batter and it will be amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious fish and chips! Good quality of food for the price point. The staff is also very friendly and attentive! Definitely a favourite in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Simple fish and chips. Can't go wrong. Price is reasonable (12-13 for 2 fish fillets, fries and a small coleslaw). This place is quite spacious, perfect for a large group."}
{"text":"Small little place in Kensington market.  Had a nice outdoor seating area with 5-6 tables.  Had the Haddock and Fires ($10.95) . You get 2 peices of fish (I got mixed. one with extra crispy miss vickies batter), Tartar sauce, Small portion of coleslaw and lots of fries.  Owner was extremely friendly and started to small talk with us.  I am def coming back next time for the Poutine as I heard great things about it.

5/5"}
{"text":"I'd been to the other location in Kensington Market, so I was super jazzed to try this new version out. The tuna melt is still amazing, and they're doing gluten free fish AND chips now! That's good for fish eaters. As well, chip eaters will be pleased to know there are options, especially if they are gluten free themselves. Get in here and relish the goodness."}
{"text":"Dope decadence in the fish shop. Kensington market has many options for gastronomists, and this is where you would go if you were interested in eating fish AND chips. Tuna melt is amazing, and they're doing gluten free fish AND chips now! That's good for fish eaters. As well, chip eaters will be pleased to know there are options, especially if they are gluten free themselves. Anyway, I would highly recommend this place, and you can tell by the other reviews that I ain't fibbing."}
{"text":"I ordered the Haddock and Chips. 
I must say, it was delicious. The batter was crispy and the fish was soft and moist. 
I am definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Poutine is really good and comes with a drink for only $5."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Fresco's for awhile now since i've read positive reviews on it here on Yelp. 

I went there on a Friday night around 7 and was expecting a big lineup. Luckily, there was no one there. I ordered the Haddock & Chips and my friend ordered the Halibut & Chips. I'm not a fish&chips connoseuir (sp?) but decided to go with the Haddock since it was about 4 dollars cheaper. I read on the menu that to have it fried with Ms. Vickie's that it would cost a dollar more. But I asked the employee that if I wanted just one of the two pieces to be Ms. Vickie'd and the other to be regular style, would it still be an extra charge and he said 'no'. 

the 2 pieces are decent-sized. I was expecting the pieces to be huge, but it was still filling. The batter was good, not too heavy and oily. The fish itself was very tender and delicious. 
The owner, who I believe is Fresco himself, asked us how our food was and thanked us for coming with a big smile. Definitely great service and will make a return visit. 

And gotta love the Beatles in the background!"}
{"text":"Ok let me get the fish puns out of the way. It was a hot summer day that may me say oh Cod one of us wanted to try out fried fish. Not wanting to be shellfish I went through the bookmarks and found this place as a squid pro quo. On we went and scaled our way to Kensington market. The place is like a puffer fish i.e. larger than expected and the AC was welcome reef on a hot day. 
After going through the menu we ordered haddock. For the halibut of it (darn had one pun left) we added a side of onion rings.
The fried fish came out piping hot. Batter is decent. I enjoyed the sub of sweet potatoes fries as well. Very good spot to try fried fish and I will be back to try other types should an 'Opportunaty' comes along."}
{"text":"After hearing about their fish and chips battered with a Miss Vickie's crunchy chip batter, I just had to check it out. I am glad to say it didn't disappoint me. The fish was good quality and the chip batter is worth it. If you like fish and chips, then check this place out."}
{"text":"Good and Fresh Fish. The fries is OK. Serve in a very traditional way. Good for take-out because the restaurant is too small, unless it's summer so you can eat in the patio outside."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here several times and I've tried the crab cakes, lobster po boy, and the fish and chips with and without the ms. vickies batter. Now maybe I'm just weird, but the fish and chips is ironically my least favourite item here. Don't know why, but I just felt that there was a lack of flavour though I'm sure many people would disagree. However I did LOVE the crab cake and po boy. I found them incredibly satisfying, very well flavoured, and especially in the case of the lobster po boy, the ingredients used tasted very fresh and natural. Although some may think the prices are on the high side, you are getting really good quality seafood, and in addition to the items you get a VERY generous portion of fries to go with it (which I can sadly never finish). so overall you get what you pay for. Will happily return when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"A review cannot do this place justice! Fish and chips done right. Fried to absolute perfection, amazing tartar sauce! Each bite tastes like I'm standing by the ocean, or at the beach with my friends! An absolute pleasure and necessary to visit this place! If you are in the area, there is no excuse! Go there, eat there, and be one happy human! Also add alittle malt or pepper to the chips"}
{"text":"This place is great! Have amazing fish and chips but my favourite is the crab cakes. Very casual and great for a quick bite. Nice patio for the summer time and very friendly service. It's a definite return spot for me! Tartar sauce is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of the fish & chips and poutines here. Been here many times since it is closer to me than the one at St Lawrence which also makes a mean fish & chip."}
{"text":"This place always fills you up with the freshest fish! My favorite Fish and Chips in Toronto. Was there on a cold fall day, people were stilled lined up and I understand why. Food was great, staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I originally wanted to go to the one in Kensington but came here instead because it was closer to Casa Loma and I am so glad I did.  The staff was excellent and so polite and accommodating.  We purchased two Haddock and two Cod Plates, we also had the Classic Quebec Poutine.  Our party of 7 all over ate and loved loved loved the food.  And YES, their tartar sauce is the best around.  

The day before we went to the Toronto Zoo and had Food truck Poutine.  My kids LOVED their first experience with Poutine but overindulged here in Fresco's

I must emphasize again that the Restaurant staff made our experience wonderful.

Worthy Note:  After viewing some of the pics I thought we'd be eating on dirty newspapers but was pleasantly surprised it was only a design on their serving paper.  ANOTHER PLUS!"}
{"text":"Love every thing about this spot, the owner is super friendly, he is always here, helpful explains to every one the different items and the \"extra crispy\" batter, I had a little bit of every thing and loveddd the shrimp and chips. Every thing from the spicy sauce that came with the shrimp was awesome to the container that it came it!!!! Would come back for sure!!!! Only problem is price is a little high, and parking is an issue!!! But them again....I knew very well where I was going I should have walked!"}
{"text":"I first encountered Fresco's from an online delivery service. I got cod and chips with their Ms. Vickie's cripsy coating with some extra gravy on the side for the fries. I knew I was in for something good when the food arrived. I love this place because they make something so simple, exactly as it needs to be - and they are on point. 

It was worth going to pay a visit to the location so I could get the unadulterated version of the same dish I had gotten delivered my first time, straight from the fryer. The staff was awesome when I visited, and they delivered a great meal and exactly all the little things that make this place so popular."}
{"text":"We came in based on all the reviews I read online and boy was I so glad we did.  It was amazing. Right from the start. The service was great. The food was great.  Michael who is the owner was the nicest. He greeted us and was very patient even though we were undecided as to what we wanted to eat. When we ordered he brought everything to our table.  He has amazing customer service skills. He was so great with everyone that walked into his restaurant. He treats every customers that walks into his place with kindness and respect. He was so pleasant to everyone.

NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE..

I ordered the calamari which was OK.  I liked them but I have had better calamari.  I made a huge mistake in not ordering the fish and chips.  The other people I was with ordered the fish and chips and boy I wish that I had ordered them too.  They were the best fish and chips I had every had compared to some other places like Chippy's and Queensway fish and Chips. The batter was nice and crispy and the fish was so fresh.  I was surprised that it wasn't as oily as some other places I have eaten at. Those two places I mentioned sucked.  The one on the Queensway doesn't even make there own tartar sauce.  They gave me packets of tartar sauce. You're a fish and chip place and you don't make your own tartar sauce from scratch??.  For goodness sake I make my own tartar sauce at home how hard is it for them to do that.  I can't believe I was serviced packages of awful tartar sauce from the Queensway fish and Chip place.
But Fresco's makes the best tartar sauce and the fish and chips.

PLEASE EVERYONE DO YOURSELVES A FAVOUR AND TRY OUT THIS PLACE YOU WOULDN'T REGRET IT. AWESOME FOOD AND WONDERFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"Split a Extra Crispy Haddock and Onion Rings with my boyfriend and while it was good, it definitely wasn't the best fried fish I've had. I thought the Miss Vickies Chips were cool, but the fish fell out of the batter and i ended up eating the batter first and picking up the naked fish with my fingers.  To me, this defeats the purpose of battering and frying it in the first place.

Everything seemed a little under-seasoned.

Onion rings were greasy and crunchy and came with a nice spicy mayo."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim looking for somewhere to eat over the holidays - was not disappointed.  This is a small shop, hidden in Kensington market.  Seating only for 6-8 people if it's too cold to sit on the patio.

I had the cod and my gf had the haddock.  The cod will have more of a fishy flavour.  I went for the extra crispy batter (ms vickies) after reading a few recommendations on yelp.  Definitely go for the extra crispy, it's worth the extra $1.  Most fish and chips I've had were greasy messes, but this meal was not.  They give you a very generous portion of fries to top, and the coleslaw actually tastes good.  We also noticed quite a few people ordering poutines, which leads me to believe it's probably pretty good.

Service here is top notch.  The guy that helped us was very friendly, easy to strum up convo and made sure we were happy. Someone came in after us and mentioned it was their first time and he offered half crispy batter and half regular at no extra charge.  He also offered me an extra tartar sauce for free (usually $1).  I also noticed they have a gluten free option which could be enticing for anyone with that intolerance.  Not many places in Toronto you can get a great meal for cheap, this is one of them."}
{"text":"Really great fish & chips! Got the 2 piece haddock with extra crispy batter. Decently priced with a pretty big serving. Couldn't finish all the chips"}
{"text":"I was very pleased to see Fresco's open up on St. Clair, having greatly enjoyed their fare down in Kensington. The extra-crispy Haddock & Chips makes for a hearty meal, accompanied by their creamy coleslaw and tartar sauce. Welcome to the neighbourhood! Can't wait to try out other tasty-looking items on your menu!"}
{"text":"What a ripoff! I just came from there and bought a two piece for over 20 bucks only find two slim, greasy, crappily battered slices of fish atop a large pile of brown, inedible chips

Never again

Gross. I am from  Newfoundland. I know what i am talking about. 

I wish i could give this joint zero stars. Off to the toilet now. I should have just dumped the plate directly into the sewer and saved my throat the disgusting feeling it has"}
{"text":"The halibut sandwich is delightful. The bread is so soft and tender. The sandwich just melts in your mouth. Fish n chips are yum too. Chowder is on point. This place does comfort food right."}
{"text":"YUM-O!  We ordered the family special (4 cod fish n chips with fries).  We all got regular batter and I thought it was battered perfectly.  It wasn't overly greasy either - obviously had some grease to it...it's fish n chips after all!  I wanted to try the poutine too but knew it would be too much food.  Will have to save that for next time!"}
{"text":"Great find! Thank you yelp! Poutine was amazing!  Boyfriend loved the fish!  So delish!"}
{"text":"Today we tried the wings!! Amazingly tasty and crispy! I gotta be honest.. A fish & chip place serving wings?! They were awesome and the two sauces were delicious!! Mild BBQ & Smoked Lime Tequila. So good! Yum!"}
{"text":"Funny enough, on my first visit here I didn't go for their renown fish and chips, but went for the crab cake Po'boy. 

The crab cake was quite good. I almost wonder if it would be better on its own however since it's breaded and battered, and when put on the bun it's a little too starchy. It was still a good sandwich, but I just wasn't floored by it.

The fries are fresh cut (and cooked) and very good.

The fish is very reasonably priced. A one piece (cod or haddock) with fries is only $8 or so, and a two piece about $12.50 - and the pieces are a good size. That's cheaper than virtually another place I've seen (of quality).

I should've tried my friend's fish for a taste and perhaps factor that in my review. It just means I'll have to head back. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Simple but lovingly prepared and delicious fried fish, and authentic savory  poutine. I prefer the extra-fried type where they mix potato chips into the batter, gives it an extra kick. Friendly staff that were helpful and accommodating, really a nice group of guys."}
{"text":"came here on a pedesterian sunday night and we managed to find a sport on a tiny patio. yay!

the food is great! and I'm talking from the vegetarian standpoint!

of course I couldn't try fish&chips but they have veg poutine! and not only one kind they have poutine with veg chili or with mushroom gravy! with cheese curds or soy for vegans. 

I tried poutine with chili and it was yummy! regular portions are about right size for a hungry person. and the staff is super friendly!
they do tend to forget about the orders so reminding them is a good idea.

there is not enough seating inside (super tiny space) but you can always take to go and in the summer the patio would probably fit around 14 ppl"}
{"text":"It is 34 degrees outside but I don't care.  I am in search of a good fish and chips place in Toronto since I cannot go to Scotland each time I crave for it.  And I say good because it is really very simple food but like most things it is hard to keep things simple.  

So I walked to Kensington Market and was greeted warmly by the person who took my order.  Yes Beatles songs were already in full blast and the staff seems to really love it.  I ordered the Halibut and Chips with a side of Quebec poutine.  I was little sceptical because I saw the fish and they were 2 squarish pieces so I managed my expectations.  As well, I had to walk back to the office for about 20 mins after I got my order so I was prepared for loss of quality with the fish.  Boy was I wrong!  The batter was light and the fish was flavourful, flaky but dense.  It survived the travel and kept its crispness and not too much oiliness.  The poutine was very, good tons of gravy and curd.  The coleslaw was also perfect.  Such a simple thing but Fresco got it right.  Worth the walk in hot weather.  My last fish and chips encounter was heavenly but this one is almost heaven."}
{"text":"They have relocated down the street a little bit. You can't miss it. The foods great as always, and the place is huge now! The service was great, everyone was smiling."}
{"text":"I'm picky with fish n chips. Yes, I'm a Madonna. It's so easy to screw up fish and chips. You'd think it's easy to cook, but there really is an art to it. The right batter with good seasoning, the right temperature to the oil, crisp fries and for the love of God, fresh fish! So given the great ratings on Yelp, I was pretty excited to finally have the chance to try Fresco's... and boy was I disappointed. 

I was expecting greatness, but what I got was a small portion of overcooked, dry and flavorless fish and soggy and under seasoned fries for $15.

I had the halibut, and being my first time I had it done half and half (half regular batter, half Ms. Vickie's).  The Ms. Vickie's batter is definitely the better of the two, have more crunch and texture, while the regular batter was soft and just not good. 

The fish wasn't overly oily, which is good, but the fish itself was very dry.  You know how in good fish and chips, the fish will flake apart? That lovely texture that just falls apart in your mouth? Well, this isn't it. The fish was chewy, dry and definitely wasn't seasoned. I ended up throwing a ton of seasoning salt, lemon and tartar sauce on it just to give it some life. 

Onto the second part of the equation: fries. They sure looked delicious, but again the lack of seasoning hurt the verdict, and the fries were a big soggy to boot.  

I'm not trying to be dramatic, but I expected a lot more from a place which has a 4.5 stars average rating on Yelp (which I treat like the bible).

It's not many times Yelp will disappoint me, but this was definitely one of them."}
{"text":"Was walking around Kensington and saw that this place has two vegetarian poutine options.   Considering I had never eaten poutine before,  I figured this would be a great place to try it.   After discussing the two different options with the apparent owner/chef, i decided to try the mushroom gravy vegetarian poutine.  ...

It was phenomenal.  My wife, who grew up in Toronto, said it was the best  veggie poutine she had ever had, and even better than many of the meat poutines.  She had just went to the \"famous\" Smoke's poutine and shared two of their veggie poutines with her friend two days earlier.  She said the poutine here was infinitely better in that you couldnt even compare the places.

It was clear that the owner/chef took great pride in all of his food.  He explained the ingreditents in the poutine to me as how to he came up with the flavor and consistentsy, which was so full for a vegetarian gravy.  He even took pride in the type of oils (yes he mixes two different types)he uses to fry the french fries in.  They were crisp, not soggy at all, and not overly greasy.

What a great overall experience."}
{"text":"Twas a weekday afternoon in the middle of this year's FIFA cup. The guy at the cashier was nice and managed to make me get the best tap water in town (lol). I ordered the crab cakes + chips.... don't let the picture deceive you, the plate was pretty big! Waited about ~10 minutes and it was brought to my table. The cakes were crispy and piping hot! Well seasoned too - still could taste the crab. 

The fries were crispy too, but weren't as hot though,and they were a but on the saltier side. I found them okay after drowning them in malt vinegar. 

Tables were very clean and there was good a/c. Will come back again to try their poutine."}
{"text":"I went to this place after seeing the good reviews on here. I went there on pedestrian Sundays so it was really crowded everywhere but thankfully there was no lineup here. I went in (the place is pretty small) and got the haddock and chips. I got two different types of haddock, one fried and the other one fried with Vickies chips I believe. Both were really good, especially with the sauces and coleslaw. 

The fries that came with it weren't too bad either.

There are a lot of advantages to being a yelper and one of them is free stuff! Before going inside I quickly looked up the place on here and luckily there was a free drink offer! Totally used it and had no trouble. The cashier was also super nice. 

Overall, it's nothing too special for me to give it 4-5 stars but it's a pretty good fish and chips place to check out!"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly service, good fries, good wings, good music, fish and chips were okay, not pricy, worth the money."}
{"text":"What can I say? Mr Fresco knows his stuff. This a great fish and chip place with a fair pricing for the quality. Service is amazing. I liked the calamari and the special Miss Vicky extra crisp batter!"}
{"text":"***1/2 stars

William T. and I trekked down to Kensington Market to try out the famed Fish & Chips at Fresco's.  The space itself is quite small, with 3 small tables and a few more tables out front on the patio.  Owner, Michael Fresco holds up shop with hired help and his love for the Beatles serves as the décor theme.

A sign which reads Fry on ZTF (zero trans fat) with the subtext that the food here is made with premium frying oil with zero trans fat and low saturated fat, coupled with the fact that the fish served here is Ocean Wise certified are what set Fresco's apart.

I opted for a bottle of orange soda from Pop Shoppe - the labeling and packaging satisfied my nostalgia.

The menu is neatly written on a chalkboard - I've never seen such uniformity and perfectionism in font before.  It made me wonder if my eyes were deceiving me.  We opted for the Halibut & Chips ($13.95) with a mixed batter: regular and extra crispy made possible by the use of Miss Vickie's chips.  The resulting product was a nice golden-brown batter and the option of extra crispy was so worth it!

Next we tried the Crab Cake Sandwich ($4.95) which came with fresh slaw on the side.  This was just okay for me and didn't have the \"wow\" factor that I had hoped for. There was more bun than crab cake in each bite, which left one wanting.

William T. wanted to try the Quebec-Style Poutine ($3.98 for a small) which was quite good.  The cheese curds stood up to the gravy and the gravy was not overly salty like most I've tried around town.

V E R D I C T

Fresco's differentiates itself by sourcing sustainable fish, and cooking with fresh oil (not like some joints that re-use their oil to the point that your fish batter is a tint of brown that raises eyebrows).  The only downer is the wait time - about 20 minutes per order.  But that's the price you pay for quality.

With the limited seating, I highly recommend you call ahead and get your order to go.

The owner is a jolly good fella, though I wish he would've let me order the Lobster Bites sans the chips but alas that was not an option.  I guess that just means I will have to come back to try it another time!"}
{"text":"Came here on a quest for my first poutine experience. It was good, but eventually the gravy made the fries really soggy to the point where everything just tasted mushy. Also, I'm not a fan of the unmelted cheese, but hey at least I can say I had poutine fries! 

Great service here as we were able to substitute the regular fries with poutine fries in our fish and chips order. The fish wasn't greasy and was perfectly cooked and flaky. This was our first fish and chips experience; unfortunately, we weren't sold on the love for fish and chips. However, the shrimp that we ordered was good."}
{"text":"What a great find! I had a friend come in from the States for the weekend and she was jonesing for some poutine. I found Fresco on yelp so I thought we'd give it a try. Not only was the walk through Kensington a blast, but our lunch was delicious! I had the mini fish and chips...soooo good. I upgraded to the sweet potato fries, excellent decision. I'm not usually a huge fan of fish and chips but this place gets a huge thumbs up for me. Great location, cool ambiance, tasty food...all good things."}
{"text":"I know that most fish and chips places use cod because it is the cheaper option, but Fresco offers Halibut which is more expensive but I highly recommend trying this kind. The texture is different from cod for sure. The halibut was not overly dry, or crumbly, rather it was a perfect mix between soft and firm. It was like in between. I just can't describe it, you guys really have to just try it for yourself! They loveeee the Beatles in this place because you can see Beatles photos adorned on the walls and their music playing. They have poutine, sweet potato fries, other dishes but I seriously just came to try the fish and chips based on the many previous reviews of it being so great! 

Come by this joint if you are in the mood for fish and chips. It's pretty great."}
{"text":"I am a bit of a stickler when it comes to fish and chips. As I grew up in Scotland I have eaten fish and chips from award winning paces, including a place in a small town called Stonehaven, the shop has won an award for the best fish and chips in the UK. 

So when I first moved to T.O and saw places advertising fish and chips...I expected something similar, unfortunately I got fish and fries...fries being the slimmer sister to the mighty chunky chip! (This is a bad state when you are craving that chunky chip and a decent dollop of mayo for dipping). 

However, while frequenting one of my favorite neighbourhood's, I stumbled across this gem. I can safely say it is the best fish and chips I have had in this beautiful city. I tried the halibut and my husband went for the haddock. The fish was not over cooked, not dry on the inside and had not been sitting under the heat lamp. It was fresh, crispy, light and not to greasy. The chips were tasty too, crispy but not too much. Not too soggy and not too over done...just perfect. I loved the dips on the side too. 

Once the weather is a bit nicer; I cannot wait to return and sit outside enjoying this fishy fare! Although I am thinking I will be stuck with chips due to the Gluten issue these days!"}
{"text":"So glad I checked out the Yelp reviews and stopped in at Fresco's! Stopped by with my folks on a lazy Sunday stroll. We all tried the cod and chips - one traditional, one crispy and we all agreed: the food is delicious! The portions are also HUGE. I personally liked the traditional better than the crispy but my parents loved the crispy. Try one of each! I wasn't expecting the coleslaw which was a pleasant surprise. We also thought the tartar sauce was super good - not your average tartar sauce! The chips were nice and crispy and chunky - not soggy at all. I'd definitely come back! The only thing we thought we'd change for next time is just getting 2 orders of the fish & chips for the three of us - the serving size is quite large, so I think the three of us could have been perfectly satisfied with two orders. Looking forward to my next lazy Sunday stroll in!"}
{"text":"Great food and the service is fantastic! Super clean eating area. Good selection of food. Our server gave us some extra food so we could try a different batter on the fish"}
{"text":"Very good fish, I had haddock xtra crispy. I added poutine which for me doesn't go well with fried fish, I prefer straight fries with salt and vinegar.. Anyways solid fish and chips but probably more appreciated by the locals who have easy access."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Ive eaten here twice. The first time I ordered one piece of cod and fries and instead of the tartar sauce, I got the chipotle mayo (which is amazing!). The batter was crispy, and the fish was perfectly cooked. The service that time was exceptional. The second time I ordered a lobster poboy, I highly recommend this one. The bread was toasted, the lobster was perfectly cooked, it tasted amazing! And i substituted the fries for a kale salad, which was extremely tasty, I recommend this one as well, when you get the fries sometimes it can be a heavy meal. The vinagrette was great, and it had sunflower seeds (i believe) and dried cranberries. This time I did not think the guy at the cashier was as friendly as the one that was working the first time I had the opportunity to go. Just because of that I did not give the 5-stars. 

 I highly recommend this place. The food is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Got a large Quebec style poutine from here and it really hit the spot. No complaints."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, even brought some friends over, a nice little place for fish & chips, loved their poutine."}
{"text":"I love this place, almost too much. The vegetarian chili poutine is seriously so fantastic and the service is always so great. It's always clean too. The portion sizes are fantastic and they have an amazing selection of beverages."}
{"text":"Fresco's is unbelievably good. The gluten-free Halibut and fries, split between two was incredibly chewy, satiating and not too greasy. Tartar sauce and coleslaw are on point Definitely returning. Amazing staff and service too:)"}
{"text":"Let's just say if you're ever in a mood for anything fried. This is the place to be.

Lobster bites were a new thing on the menu when we went and they were amazing. 

Fish and chips amazing.

Poutine was amazing."}
{"text":"It was worth the trip down to Kensington. My aunt wanted to go out for fish and chips so I thought that this was the perfect opportunity to check out Fresco's. Consider taking the subway down here as finding parking on a Saturday afternoon is harder than finding a needle in a haystack. Anyway, I digress. The place is tiny so there aren't too many tables. In fact, there are literally two tables so you might have to share your area with strangers. 

We ordered a few things to share between the two of us. 
* Quebec Style Poutine - as other Yelp'ers have mentioned, you get a generous portion of cheese curds and gravy on a bed of greasy fried goodness. We ordered the 'small' size, which came with a can of pop for $5.
* Haddock and Chips - we tried the unique Miss Vickie's salt & vinegar chip batter. We got two large pieces of haddock with a little cup of coleslaw and a french fries. 
* Fried Pickles - I ordered these just because; Saturday's are my cheat days and I wanted fried pickles so I just ordered it. For $5, you get 4 pickles. They were okay.

I can't come here everyday, but I'm looking forward to returning to Fresco's once the weather is nice. With your Yelp App, check in and you get a can of pop or bottled water.

Good for: fish and chips, poutine, cheap eats, cheat eats"}
{"text":"Wowaweewah! Ranks among the best simple, divey fish & chips you can find in the Americas! It's a streetside food stall with a few outdoor patio seats or takeout. The potato chips based crust is really what won me over. This will be a must have anytime that I am in Toronto city. Just look at the pictures and you will see they take their fish and chips very seriously. Comes on some faux newspaper, fried to perfection but dry to the touch. The fish itself is moist and flaky. And of course they have the trifecta of fixings - malt vinegar, lemon wedges & tartar sauce. The chips themselves are good in complementing the fish, but be sure to eat them right right away as this variety has that tendency to get kind of stale and tough soon as they cool to room temperature.

Overall - TWO thumbs up from a fish and chips lover!"}
{"text":"Exellent fish and chips ($12 with coleslaw). Very crispy and not overly salty Miss Vicky's batter for the fish. We also ordered crab cakes ($11 with coleslaw) which were flavourful. Great portion size and value. Good service with a smile. Clean washrooms."}
{"text":"The fish and chips here were good. I had the halibut and chips. I thought the piece of halibut was quite small. I'm a big fish and chips person and I've been to quite a few fish and chips restaurants in Toronto and always order halibut if it's available. I thought the portion here was about half of what you typically get at other restaurants. It did taste good, though. For a $15 meal I didn't think it was very good value, there are better fish and chips options in Toronto in my opinion."}
{"text":"Not much to say here.  Great fish (get the extra crispy!)!  Cool location too.  Poutine is solid and when the weather is nice the patio is nice for people watching."}
{"text":"Best haddock I've ever had. Poutine was on point. Lobster poboy was good. Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Favourite fish and chips in Toronto. The restaurant is tiny but it's great when it's not crowded."}
{"text":"This is really good fish and chips, I love it.  Very fast and friendly service as well, and the price is reasonable.  Dan"}
{"text":"I usually get wings or fish and it's excellent. 

The prices are average if not slightly more but it's sooooo worth it. 

The lb of wings and a side comes with 8 decent size wings that are f'n good, add a poutine as the side for a few dollars more and it's a feast. 

Very very very good!"}
{"text":"Haddock fish and chips and a small clam chowder on a cold December day. 
Great stop for lunch."}
{"text":"Fresco 's Fish and Chips is a winner! We ordered the Cod fish and chips (one regular and one extra crispy) and a Lobster Po Boy. The spicy mayo on the Lobster Po Boy and the soft ciabatta bun instantly make this sandwich a winner. I would recommend picking up a Lobster Po Boy on your first visit. The Cod fish and chips weren't as exciting but the quality and attention required to make this a great meal was there. The ratio of battered goodness to fish was just right and the fresh cut fries were an excellent pairing."}
{"text":"going to keep this review simple: BEST fish and chips i've ever had... and i've had one of the best fish and chips from London, England.

we ordered a regular poutine and a cod fish and chips.  the thin layer of light crispy batter was the perfect texture.  the fish tasted great, the fries were great.  the poutine was good too (though rather ordinary.  on par with or slightly better than a typical poutine with gravy and cheese curds)

bottom line. get the fish and chips.  if youre looking for the best, look no further."}
{"text":"I was wearing a Moroccan hat, and then it disappeared, I was like, \"where'd my Fez-go?\" Well, it came here, to try some Poutine.

I don't see eye to eye with a lot of Toronto reviewers. Not on this place anyway. I'm spoiled by Quebec Poutine and English and Belgian Chips, maybe? I don't know.

I don't like writing negative reviews, and I'd never give a little family owned place less than a 3 unless I was forced to at gunpoint (which would be hot), but I so, so didn't enjoy the Poutine. It tasted nothing like Poutine from Quebec, which is fine if it's delicious anyway, but I found it bland and somewhat off. In fact I probably ate less than a quarter of it. And if you factor in that it wasn't cheap, you're left with a 3 star rating.

The fries themselves were just okay, gravy did not have that smooth taste I loved, and cheese curds weren't the perfect squeaky kind you find up in QC. You can get good Poutine outside Quebec (Allen St Poutine in Buffalo, and a few in Ottawa, and NYC even), but I've yet to find an excellent one in Toronto.

Also, while the decor is amazing (think: The Beatles and England) and the locale is fantastic (right in the heart of the Kensington outdoor Market, perfect for people watching), the wait time was so long that the unappealing final product was even more disappointing.

So unfortunately you won't be hearing me decree \"Lesco to Fresco.\" However it is Leg Day so Legggoooo."}
{"text":"2 Haddock fish fillet with fries coleslaw and a lemon wedge ~$13 
The fish fillet is freshly fried and you can choose what kind of fish you want. The fries aren't anything special but still tasty. I like how they packaged the lemon and delicious tartar sauce. But this takeout place has some places to sit down, since it's in a cozy market of Kensington.

I also tried the clam chowder which was rich and tasty, and not too salty.
Couldn't resist ordering fried mozzarella sticks (fried very well), AND poutine...

Yup, basically a cheat meal, but highly satisfied and did not feel too weighed down after! 

The place is very small so you may have to eat elsewhere if it is full!"}
{"text":"Fresco's quickly has become our go-to monthly take out treat.

We usually order the fish rolled in chips along with the home made coleslaw and fries - so good! Food is consistently fresh, hot, and tasty. Service is fast and friendly.

I don't think they deliver but I believe they may be partners with Uber Eats if you don't feel like visiting the restaurant to pick up.

Pro tip : make sure you try their home made tartar sauce, it is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Came here for poutine, and end up getting their mini Fish&Chips combo with haddock and poutine instead of chips (for $10). Their poutine was amazing -- freshly made fries with chunky cheese curds and hearty gravy. Their fish was also one of the best I've had, perfectly seasoned batter that was extremely crunchy at the same time. The haddock itself was extremely tender. I'd have to stop by at this place every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The fresco fries.

I can't. They taste SO good.  My constructive criticism would be, add more frescho to the fries.  I need to overdose please.  I need to swim in it Fresco chefs!  Next time you order ANYTHING from here, GET the fresco fries and then you can thank me later.

I can't remember what the other stuff tasted like... Deep fried battered fish really just starts to gross me out after 5 mins with them oil levels... But the FRESCO FRIES THO. OMG I can't get over them.  Oh, and don't forget to squeeze some lemon on that for the #saltbae garnish of it all. Gimme dat zest. Please don't gimme one of those weird lemons with the varicose veins either! hmmph!

I've only ordered via UberEats so I don't know if the chef is evil or not.  If he/she is you can't taste it...

5 Stars!

{"text":"The miss vickies add on is pretty awesome. The fries that come with are a HUGE portion. I got the haddock and the fish was moist and crunchy on the outside. The coleslaw was pretty good and the tartar sauce was on point. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Really delicious fish and chips which I have had delivered to my home several times by a young gentleman on an electric bike. No plans to eat in at their location because I have heard they have TWO tables, and NO parking. Its Kensington Market! Now that they have great reviews they have signed up with one or several ordering websites like Just Eat, but now I am OUTSIDE their delivery area. Is it because Kathleen Wynee is selling Ontario Hydro and electric bikes don't go that far? If you are young vibrant hipster hit their place hard for FANTASTIC fish and chips. If your an old senior like me, continue to open cans of Fancy Feast at home."}
{"text":"Definitely the best fish and chips place downtown.  The Halibut was of good thickness and not dry!  Friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"So I really did like their fish, possibly one of the best I've had in a fish and chips place. Unfortunately I really disliked their fries. Maybe I got a bad batch but they tasted under cooked.  Even the poutine we ordered was terrible.  This place is getting lots of great reviews so probably just went at a bad time."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try poutine ever since I heard about them years ago. While staying in Kensington, I was desperately looking for a place that had it and then I saw that Fresco's Fish and Chips had a menu with it. 

So poutine is chips (fries) with gravy and cheese curds on it. It's pretty straight forward and after I had my first bite, it was super good. It's pretty much what I expected it to be and I was happy I was right. The chips were nice and crispy, the gravy tasted really good, and I loved the little pieces of cheese (they melted a while later and made it even better). I got the small size and it was actually pretty big and I couldn't even finish it so they make good portions. 

The staff were super friendly. The guy taking my order was helpful and helped me pick the kind of poutine I wanted  (there were some other types with meat or mushrooms). It was definitely an experience and I'm glad I got to have it here."}
{"text":"Had fish and chips (Halibut). The service was friendly, the food was good and price reasonable. The fish could have been bigger but still reasonable. 

I don't like how they serve the coleslaw and gravy in small plastic containers, is kinda tacky. Also the bottom of that fish and chips plate was a newspaper like thin paper which got really torn apart with the food moisture; I think I accidentally ate a piece of the paper with my food :(

Overall a solid 3 star."}
{"text":"Great fried haddock. Very crispy exterior and tender, fresh interior of fish. The tartar sauce that accompanied it was perfect, and the slaw was delicious as well. The poutine was alright."}
{"text":"Seriously AMAZING food! Came to Toronto for only a weekend but am super glad this was one of our stops! Ordered the poutine and lobster bites (I had actually seen a picture on yelp where someone had put the lobster bites on top of the poutine and I HAD to do the same thing). Honestly, could there be a more PERFECT combination? The lobster bites were perfectly crisp on the outside and soft, crumbly and FLAVORFUL on the inside. The poutine was heavily loaded with cheese and gravy and each and every bite was a blast of flavor. Drooling as I write this review and really wish I could have some more...

On a side note, we stopped by on an extremely rainy Saturday night and the place was empty. Small, cozy interior that could seat maybe 10-15 people. Also, the service here is very friendly. We were getting our food to go and the woman working there was kind enough to separate all our items so they wouldn't get soggy. (Still recommend eating the food fresh - we ended up having everything in the car because it smelled way too good!) Unfortunately, I did not get to try their fish & chips :( Looking forward to my next trip to Toronto so I can come back here and get my hands on more of their food!"}
{"text":"Visited on a weekday a little after noon and was surprised to find this place with relatively few customers given the hype online. We waited about 10 minutes for our food. I got a lobster po-boy for $8.95 + tax and my friend got a piece of cod + chips also for $8.95 + tax. While the cod was good, the chips were average according to them. My po-boy was a bit disappointing to be honest and didn't live up to the hype on previous Yelp reviews. Lobster was flavourful but the bread was almost soggy and flat."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Place very small. And very busy. There is a patio outside but right now too cold to use it.  The haddock and chips were very delicious, nice and crispy outside and juicy inside, Quebec style poutine was amazing and so was the lobster po boy. Everyone enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"I feel I'm just going to be another positive review here but and experience this good deserves to be told. Fresco's has become my chippy of choice  with its combination of friendly service, great food and great location. Located in one of my favourite parts of the city Fresco's serves good old fashioned fish & chips and does it very well. 

Portions are filling and come with two pieces of fish (haddock in my case), fries, cole slaw and of course tar tar. Fish is perfectly cooked, moist but still flaky with a batter that's just the right thickness with a good crisp to them. There's a choice of batter and my recommendation is to get one fish in the classic and the other with the Miss Vicki's which gives it a nice extra crunch nice change of flavour.

Fries are great and are of the proper hand cut, skin on type and the cole slaw has just the right amount of mayo so it's still a nice and refreshing complement to its deep fried friends.

I've been there twice and the service is very friendly, the second time it was the owner and he's an all around good guy to talk to and it's obvious he really does care a lot about creating a quality product. 

Sitting outdoors on the patio enjoying the fish and chips while watching the goings on in the Kensington area, can't get anymore perfect. Extra bonus that the boxes and even the utensils are biodegradable so you can feel kinda good about indulging in fried foods :)"}
{"text":"I can honestly say this is my most fave fish and chips place in Toronto. I used to go to chippies but now I'll come here.  The fish batter was nice and light and the fries were blanched and fried to perfection.  

Michael the owner has a real passion for what he does.

There are a lot more interesting things to try for next time such as the crab cakes, seafood sandwiches and today we'll be trying the mushroom Poutine.

Check it out."}
{"text":"We are from LA and visiting Toronto for the first time, this place is awesome, great food, great people, remember to try their famous fries, check in gets you a free coke as well."}
{"text":"I went here on a whim after a searching online for a nearby restaurant. I definitely don't regret it, the food is good. I don't think it's the best fish and chips, and I don't think it's the worse. Its a mid-level fish and chips joint. 

I will definitely go back as it's one of the only fish and chips places near my work. As for recommendation, go ahead, try it out and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Nice little place at Kensington market. Sandwiches and fish and chips were good and crispy - I really liked their Kale Salad - try it!"}
{"text":"Originally I was planning to visit Rasta Pasta, but it was closed on Monday. So I went through my hierarchy list and Fresco's Fish & Chips was my next best option. This is one of the two 
Fresco's Fish & Chips locations in Toronto.

Each Fish & Chips order comes with chips, coleslaw & tartar sauce. There are different seafood to choose from - haddock, cod, halibut, shrimp, lobster bites, calamari, or crab cakes. You can pay extra CAD $0.75 for Miss Vickie's extra crisp batter or pay extra $3 to substitute regular fries with sweet potato fries, onion rings, Quebec poutine, deep fried pickles, battered mushrooms, or mozzarella sticks. There are sanitizing hand wipes at the cashier counter and one of my friends took at least 10 packs of wipes.

***

Halibut Fish & Chips (1 piece CAD $14.95 + Miss Vickie's extra crisp batter CAD $0.75): Halibut tasted a bit dry, but fish quality wasn't too bad and tasted fairly tender. Normally I am not a big fan of fries, but these fries were actually very good.

***

Keep in mind that fish & chips is very filling and you might want to share your order with friends if you also want to try other food in Kensington Market."}
{"text":"Take your fish and chips over to Bellevue Square for a lovely picnic. 
Then take your garbage back for the lovely man who works there to recycle.

We lucked out with SUPER huge portions, but he warned us this was because he got the wrong order this week. It was still really really good, but I don't know about the best I've ever had. It wins because of where it is, and because they're environmentally sustainable, and because the food is still really, really, really good."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. This place is extremely small. More of a place for take out or delivery (which they do). I ordered the haddock extra crispy (miss Vickie's chip batter) and poutine. The haddock was okay....I've eaten far better battered fish elsewhere for the same price. I do have to say the poutine was really good. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"*Slow clap* Well done Michael, well done. 

Here is an owner that knows how to put together a small shop and serve up some amazing food. Grade A service (Michael et al are super friendly, remember their customers and know how to provide customer service).

I've tried a good number of the things they have on the menu and I can for sure say you need to try their Miss Vickie's batter (don't worry you can get two pieces and try a different batter on each to compare) and their sauces are to die for! Portions are large (I don't think I've been able to finish all the fries yet), and prices are very reasonable.

On the plus side is their crab cakes (probably one of the better ones I've had in the city!) and to outdo themselves, Michael continually tries to come up with something better to please his customers. In the summer he was serving real cream soft-serve (not of that air-y fake milk stuff). It's too bad he had to get rid of it, but now he's made up for it with some incredible  poutines!

Anyways, it's without question I send everyone to Fresco's when they ask me for Fish and Chips, and rightly so no one has ever disliked my recommendation!"}
{"text":"Food is good most of the time but it can be so horrible at other times based on the staff. If the owner Michael is there you're in for a treat!  I'd give it five stars.  However, the last several times I've been there his staff and food was so horrendous I don't think I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"The vibe: It's a Beatles themed fish n' chips shop with a patio in Kensington Market. What more could you want?

The food: Delicious fried goodness. 

My go-to meal: The poutine. It's Quebec style, approved by my French Canadian friend. Sometimes, I just get cravings for that poutine and have to pop in. Other times, I'll splurge and get fish n' poutine. No shame. 

Secret: Ask for your fish extra crispy. ;)"}
{"text":"Nice place with nice food served by nice girls.
I didn't expect how good the food will be but it really surprised me. I ordered the mini fish& chips and extra Miss Vickie's ( to make it crispier). The haddock and fries were not greasy at all and the Miss Vickie's made the potato amazing!! 

The original sauce they provided was seasoned mayonnaise and it taste very good but even better while mixed with ketchup ( it's just my choice). The fish was really tender too.

The stuff was very friendly and nice to explain with patience if you first come to have it.

I really wanted to change the fries into mushroom gravy poutine because it looks so delicious and I noticed that the gravy was cooked after ordering and served with hot. It was so great. You know some restaurants just reheat the freezing gravy and pour the  dis-fresh one onto the fries...

I would like to go for poutine again! You can try it if you are around the Kensington."}
{"text":"This is an always stop, whenever we are in the Kensington Market area. 
Their Quebec Style poutine is a must try. Hot smoking gravy melting the cheese curds on those fresh fries....mouth watering just by thinking about it. And they have this poutine special for $5 that comes with a pop too.
Just a reminder, it is a very small place. With only 2 small tables inside."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend a while back the past summer. It's a great little place for fish and chips with a small front patio with wooden benches facing the Kensington park; perfect for the warm weather (while we still had it) . 
My boyfriend absolutely loves fish and chips so of course he's a bit biased. 
Perhaps it was the atmosphere or that we had a nice time there, but the fish and chips were really bomb. Not too oily and served on newspaper with the perfect amount of crunchiness. 
Now I'm hearing that's poutine and that's totally my thing (hey I can indulge!). Definitely interested in trying the poutine next time around."}
{"text":"Fresco's is an institution! It's been so long that I don't even recall the number of years they've been here. To say this place probably serves the best fish and chips in town is not far from the truth.

Hot and fresh fried seafood that won't break the bank. You pretty much cannot go wrong with anything you order from crab cakes to the plain old haddock and chips. Their fish is always juicy and tender with  perfectly crispy batter. Fries are always fresh and delicious. If you are in the area you definitely owe it to yourself to stop by."}
{"text":"Asked the chef what's good 

He fed me like a champ , the clam chowder was better then the ones I had in Boston"}
{"text":"Wow Yum This food is the bomb. What a shame Diana or whoever she is wrote the only bad review of this place (a pretty badly written review as well). I don't know how anyone could get soggy food from this place because Miss Vicki's crispy batter is as crisp as it gets. 

I'm from Australia people. I've lived in the states, Canada and traveled all over the world. These are the best fish and chups, no seriously, these are the best. Australia is one of those countries who has perfected the art of fish and chips and like McDonalds, there is literally one on every corner. That's been a hard thing for me to SWALLOW since coming to live in North America is the lack of fish and chup shops. 

For some reason Yelp filtered out the top seven great reviews of this place and I didn't discover that until I went back to write this review. 

I had 2xHaddock, with sweet pattootie fries, chipotle, some sauce that was a magnificent cross between tar tare and mayo, and a coke zero. For the two of us it came to 25 bucks. 

Turns out it's not that hard to be nice to the customers, the portions are very filling and the atmosphere is great. Woot!!! Fish and Chups!!"}
{"text":"I came by for Fish and Chips for lunch on a Sunday, the place was very empty around 12:30pm. I got a one piece cod & chips + small Quebec poutine for 15CAD; in hindsight, I should have asked for a single piece of fish with my poutine instead of double potatoes... 

The cod was really well cooked, with perfect texture, but I think the batter could be just a touch more seasoned. The tartar sauce is on the sweet side, so much so that the malt vinegar + lemon didn't make much of a difference to balance the flavor. The poutine gravy was also on the sweet side, so I had a hard time finishing it without something savory in my mouth to balance. 

Portions are reasonable but not huge, so pricing seems very fair. Fries/chips are nothing special."}
{"text":"Best Poutine in town. Fish and chips are great too but the calamari are the best you'll ever have. Really worth trying that place."}
{"text":"Why haven't I tried this place earlier??  It was excellent!  I LOVE that they have all kinds of alternative choices if you don't want fries/chips.  I had the haddock and fried mushrooms, turns out you get mushrooms AND some fries as well. 

The food wasn't too greasy considering it was all fried.  

It comes in a little box with some printed paper.  There's only a couple of seats inside and the patio is quite small.  If you come here in the winter, plan to take it home.    

Price wasn't too bad considering how much food you get."}
{"text":"Came here because Moo Frites was closed.

Last time I was here I ordered the lobster po boy...it was nice.  Unfortunately, it was not available today when I went so I went with the shrimp po boy...It had the same coleslaw and chipotle but I was missing the lobster bits.

Fries were great.  I asked for unsalted which they didn't salt anymore but I forgot to ask them to wipe the remaining salt in the bowl that they put the fries into.

Service was nice.

Have to try the poutine next time."}
{"text":"Go here often for their poutine. Best poutine I've tried so far. I haven't had their fish and chips yet but I've heard great things about about them. 
The staff is extremely friendly and give good portions."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips in Kensington! I got the haddock with one extra crispy piece and one regular to compare them, and while I tend to prefer crispy things I must admit the traditional batter won me over. Great fries as well. The space is very small and it can get VERY crowded at times, but it's worth waiting for. Snag a space in the front patio area if it's sunny and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pleasant, but not too special. I preferred Harbord, mainly because their fish is just awesome.

Still on the search for authentic British chip shop chips.

note: ordered from uber eats, haven't checked out this place in person."}
{"text":"True neighborhood gem, in my book anyways. I tried the cod fish and it was very juicy and crispy which it what fish and chips should be all about! Tartar sauce reminds be of authentic Belgian mayo for the fries. It goes so well with the \"chips.\" Go get some!!"}
{"text":"I have to say this is the bomb....I will always have a soft spot for Chippy's for making me love F& C again.... but this place is quite the place.

The dancing/singing chef was friendly - and he did the half & half batter - half original and half Ms. Vickie's and boy oh boy it was delicious.
Chippy's got their batter and sauce down to a pat but,  Fresco's got the portion, service and poutine down to a pat.
Just perfect portion that I can truely enjoy the before, during and after eating experience.

Gotta love a man who loves the Beetles...!!!"}
{"text":"Got a large poutine, was not expecting the portion to be massive and delicious. Gravy and cheese were spread all through the fries not just dumped on top. Also ordered the crab cake po boy which was PHENOMENAL. Everything came out hot and timely. Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"This place probably offers the best fish and chips in Toronto. Don't get me wrong I've had better. But again, in the city of Toronto I think it's the best I've had so far. 

If you like fresh fries and thin battered crispy fish, you need to give this place a chance. 

Price: very reasonable. 

Service: great. At first I thought its food court style, but they do bring your food to the table and offer you tap water in a cup. 

In summary: the best place to be at when you're in the neighbourhood of Kensington."}
{"text":"The food was too greasy, and I felt bad after having the fish and chips...i believe it's been over rated on yelp ,,,"}
{"text":"This was my first time in Toronto, so I had to try some poutine and heard this was a good place to go! The dining area is spacious, casual, and comfortable. Service was friendly as well. We tried a small Quebec-style Poutine, which made for a hearty snack, but wasn't anything that memorable or special. It was just fries that were a bit soggy from some gravy.

By the way, we came here and to the surrounding area on a Pedestrian Sunday in Kensington Market (highly recommend!)."}
{"text":"The fish and chips here are awesome! I had the famous Miss Vickie's batter and it was what you would call the icing on the cake! The chips were real and were very tasty as well! I can't wait to come back and try their other stuff :D"}
{"text":"After a return visit, I feel like Fresco's is a bit average. Despite the hundreds of TripAdvisor rave reviews, the place is just ok and this is further reflected in the light crowd on most days.

A fish n chips with fried cod will set you back around 14$. The fish has a flaky crust, yet is bland overall. They have a batter that uses Mrs. Vickie's chips for a bit of extra flavour and crunch.

The fries on my most recent visit were a plentiful mound of soggy, unseasoned potatoes."}
{"text":"Halibut, fries, and The Beatles? Oh my.

Fellow Yelper, Ian L., was recommending this place to me on one of our food adventure weekends.  

It was delicious - but I think I had high expectations and was comparing it to Pajo's in Richmond, B.C.  (I know, I'm a snob, eh?)"}
{"text":"This place good. Fish good. Fire bad.

1. Crushed potato chips in the batter for extra crispy and extra flavor = good.
2. Light, crispy and not greasy.
3. Bigger pieces of fish than The One That Got Away, the place I went to last week.
4. Friendly people working the register and cooking the food.
5. No deep fried Mars bars. One star off."}
{"text":"The hype is real. An outstanding fish and chips (non-oily, just the right portion, no excess batter). The large amount of fries is a plus. Service is friendly and competent. 

Went for halibut and chips with extra tartar sauce, the extra sauce wasn't needed but made dipping a lot easier. 

This is strictly take out, but you can go sit down anywhere in the market."}
{"text":"Super authentic-tasting fish and chips and a meal we enjoyed thoroughly. After living in the UK for a couple of years for school, I've been picky about my fish & chips meals since moving back home to Toronto. I've found very few spots reminiscent of the meals I had there - I\"m happy to say that this is one of the few that mirrors my favourite spots in London!

FIrst, the parking situation. There's limited street parking in the area. However, there is a parking lot behind King's Cafe (which is right across from Fresco's), where parking is $5.00 after 6:00 PM on weekdays (can't recall if this is the situation on weekends as well).

Second, the service. The chef and the cashier were both so sweet, going as far as asking people to move down a table to make room of us, as we were eating in. Great service, very accommodating. 

Third, the food and environment. Super casual, very limited seating. It's a small spot, but they deliver big on flavour. We ordered a fish and chips meal with just 1 piece of fish to try, covered generously in Miss Vickie's potato chip batter - TRY this. Imagine your favourite potato chips mashed up and covering a very delectable piece of meat, and you've got this. The chips don't overpower the fish at all and gives it pretty awesome dimension! Great fish to batter ratio, super crunchy, awesome textures, wonderfully fresh. Sure, it won't do much to decrease your waistline, but the quality of the fish is unmistakeable and coupled with delicious batter, it made for a great meal. The chips were also fine - a little too thick for my liking, but they still paired deliciously with the fish.

Great meal - definitely a must-try when you're in Kensington Market! For 1 piece of haddock, covered in Miss Vickie's batter, with chips, and coleslaw, we paid $10.12."}
{"text":"We wanted fresh, hot, tasty fried things & that's what we got. Fish, chips, calamari, & a lobster roll to boot! We even took it back to our hotel & it was still delicious. They throw in lemon wedges & even offer malt vinegar for us chips aficionados."}
{"text":"It's pretty safe to say that these are the best fish and chips I've had, and they beat the pants off of the few iterations I had when I was in England last summer (isn't that the home of this dish?). A few of us dropped by this small joint for a somewhat late dinner (around 9 PM). I don't know much about Toronto, but even though the neighborhood seemed somewhat shady at this time of night, the people who work here are absolutely delightful to chat with, even after a day where we were told that there were lines out the door the entire day! Prices are pretty reasonable (you can get a standard fish and chips for around $10-12, depending on what you hanker for), and the food gets prepped pretty quickly. That said, there are all of 3 tables inside, so unless you come late (like we did) or (I reckon) when it opens, it may be tough to get indoor seating.

As for the food itself - divine. I've had all manner of fish sticks and their variants, but the kind here is really fresh and tender. The cod I had was done in batter that was made 'extra crispy' (basically they just crush a bag of sea salt Miss Vickie's chips and add it to the batter) that added a nice kick, but the fish was still very soft and buttery. My girlfriend got the lobster bites, which are basically the same thing as popcorn chicken, but with lobster meat instead. Tasty stuff - and you have to eat this (and any of the other fishes, IMO) with the chipotle sauce. It's not super-spicy, but it really adds a depth of flavor that regular tartar sauce just doesn't have. The fries are pretty standard; if anything, my only complaint is that they give you a ton of fries when I'd rather trade half (or more) in to get another breaded filet of fish.

This really is a fantastic little shop, and I'd come back here anytime (if I was in town often). Incredibly tasty fish, lots of different types of fish (they also do haddock and salmon, to name a couple others), and a really awesome group of people who work there as well."}
{"text":"I would say this fish and chips place is the second best I had in Toronto. The best being Old Yorke in Leaside. They have a special add on here with Miss Vickies chips which makes the batter a lot crunchier. I typically get the crab cakes and it tastes very fresh and nicely seasoned. My boyfriend usually gets the halibut which is fresh and flakey. The fries it comes with are good but I prefer a tarter tar tar sauce. I've also seen this place on Uber Eats and noticed the prices are insanely jacked up compared to in store."}
{"text":"My favourite.  I drive from Brampton just to bring my British Mum here to eat!   Excellent food and service"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant, I like how the haddock wasn't all batter, it was a nice portion of actual fish. They give you the option to have regular batter or more crispy batter which was cool! The poutine was good but I didn't think it was anything too special. I really enjoyed the lobster Poboy, I generally don't like coleslaw but this one was really good. Fries were nice and crispy! We paid approx $18 for the lobster combo and $14 for the haddock."}
{"text":"So now that I'm officially out of hibernation and from my break from Yelp, I rose again from the ashes to review the most prestigious fresco's fish and chips.

This place is the quintessential fish and chips shop. It's what every chippy hopes to be. Fresco's is the brick and mortar of Kensington Market. With every patron they serve, they only grow their fried fish empire. 

That being said, why go to Kensingtion and not revel in the delicious menu and fried goodness Fresco's has to offer?! Wasted trip, I would say! Long story short, you got to try this place -- you just got to."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the Quebec style poutine and the price! We got a small poutine, but it was good-sized snack for two. Also got the crab cakes. 3 nicely sized cakes with a delicious chipotle sauce for $5! Super friendly owner and staff who seem like they really love what they do. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ordered: 
Poutine Québéçoise, $6.
Drink included.

2 cod fish & chips, $11.95.
With coleslaw & homemade tartar sauce.

Free pop (via yelp).

Fish with Vickies chips batter rendered a crispier version.

Poutine was ok; gravy was not salty.

Chips were not the normal chubby f&c chips, but were ok."}
{"text":"Came here in the summer, and it really is the best Fish and Chips in the city!

It is a tiny little shop with limited patio seating, so snag a spot if you see one, or head to a nearby park if you can! Because they make everything fresh, it can take a couple of minutes for your food to be ready, but it's worth the wait. 

The fish is lightly battered, perfectly crispy, and moist in the middle. The french fries are crispy and lightly salted, which made for perfect poutine (that didn't instantly get soggy). Most importantly, everything is hot and fresh! 

I will definitely be back to try the po-boy and for more fish and chips!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips!

My friend and I are visiting Toronto for the first time and decided to come here based on a friend's recommendation.  We were not disappointed.  I had the cod and poutine and my friend had the haddock.  Both fish were nicely fried and not at all greasy.  Probably one of the best fish and chips I've had in my life.  The owner was very friendly and the service was great.  He checked up on us which is not the norm in most places.  I would definitely go again if I'm in town for a visit."}
{"text":"Error"}
{"text":"This place stands out as one of the best fish and chips places.  

The fish was very fresh, fried perfectly and was not oily.  I ordered the halibut and asked for one regular battered and the other with Miss Vickie's extra crisp batter.  In my opinion, I preferred the regular batter and would just stick to that the next time.  The fries were also very good as they were crispy and not greasy.  

The décor is what you would expect from a fish and chips place, nothing fancy with just enough seating, and the service was very good."}
{"text":"Very fast service with healthy portions of fish and chips. The price is right on this one and the people working there are very nice. I hope this one stays in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I have nothing but positive things to say about this place, other than it could be bigger, but then it may lose its charm, so it's great as is :) Located in Kensington market, Michael serves up freshly prepared, ocean approved eats. We ordered the halibut and chips and lobster po boy. The fish was incredibly flaky and flavourful. Fries were lightly salted, skins on. The lobster was lightly battered and fried, inside a buttery toasted bun with cheese and coleslaw. We thoroughly enjoyed every bite of our food, and watched as Michael took the time to chat with his customers and genuinely thank them for checking out his place. His place has been around for 5 years,  and if you haven't yet, I highly recommend you go here the next time you want fish n' chips. You won't be disappointed! I've also heard great things about the wings and poutine. **for those with nut allergies, this is a peanut safe zone**"}
{"text":"Kensington Market was the last stop in my trip to Toronto and I'm so happy that Fresco's was my last meal in Canada! Their cod fish and chips was so fresh and perfectly cooked that I rank it better than a lot of fish and chip shops I visited in England. The lobster po boy was great too because of the fresh lobster and perfectly made coleslaw. The whole menu looked delicious and the owner is a really friendly guy and provided amazing customer service. One of the best seafood meals I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"This is by far my fav downtown fish and chips spot. Never been disappointed. The owner is energetic and a huge Beatles fan. You come in, get welcomed, served, fed quickly with a mass of good food and leave happy. Every time."}
{"text":"I have just experienced Poutine nirvana and I'm having difficulty putting it in words. 

Maybe it was because it's the first warm day of the winter with the sun shinning, or the Beatles radio that Fresco's plays. 

But I believe it was the perfectly cooked fries, the beautiful stringy cheese curds, and the perfectly seasoned gravy that are probably clogging up my arteries with great joy. 

This is best Poutine I've ever had in the 20 years living in Toronto (originally from Montreal). 

A lot of places are coming up with their own poutines, or gourmet poutines. But Fresco's finds the heart and soul of the poutine, and makes it shine in all it's glory. 

I'm going to pass out from my poutine coma now. Thank you Fresco's, I will see you again soon."}
{"text":"Out of all the places I tried in Toronto, FRESCO'S is by far my favorite restaurant.  Seriously.  It was the place I was most excited to try.  I stayed up until 3am on multiple nights just reading reviews of the place.  Sad, but true.

And Fresco's is also the place that made me decide to change my yelp rating system.  From this day forward, the only time I will give a restaurant 5 stars is when something is SO GOOD, all I can do is eat and say \"oh my god. it's so good... it's soooooo good\".  Because, as embarrassing as that is, that's what I did at Frescos.

Reasons I was excited to try this place:
1. I love fries.  You can deep fry ANYTHING (almost), and I will love it.
2. I love love love love good service.  I've been reading about the great service here.
3. The food looks delicious.
4. Miss Vickie's batter.  That's all you needed to say!!

So of course, I get here, and already know what I want.  Cod fish & chips with Miss Vickie's batter, please.

Reasons I love this place:
1. Everything I had been looking forward to was TRUE.  I really hate when you look forward to something bc of rave yelp reviews, and the reviews aren't true.
2. They give a very generous portion of french fries.
3. Miss Vickie's batter is the business.  It is the bomb dot com.  It is life changing.  I never thought I'd eat any batter THAT crispy yet light on a fish. 
4. The owner (I think...if not, then sorry, but the cashier) is so cool.  He's so accommodating and generous.  We couldn't decide between 1 fish & chips meal with extra fish or 2 fish & chips meals.  He suggested we order 1 meal with extra fish and offered to make extra fries if we needed.  Being the fatties we are, we opted for 2 separate meals.  ALSO, he tried to move in tables from the patio to accommodate another couple.  That was pretty sweet.
5. I like the boxes!  They're cute. :)  The presentation is great, as well.  Love the newspaper!
6. You know that gross, heavy feeling you get when you eat something that's been deep fried?  You don't get that here!  Not sure what oil they use, but my fish wasn't oily, the chips weren't oily, and I didn't feel sickly and gross after eating.

Tips for fellow yelpers:
1. If you don't like fishy flavors (like me), don't be shy and order the cod (like I did).  While it was good and while I definitely recommend it and would re-order, try to be adventurous and order the haddock!  It's not too fishy at all!  It gives your meal extra flavor. :)  OR, you can do what I did and order the cod while your bf orders the haddock...and eat his food. :D
2. The tabs on the box come apart!  And there's more fries hidden underneath the fish.  The box opens up!  I went a little tab-ripping-happy and tore apart all 4 tabs.  Next time, I'll just tear apart 2 of them so the fries don't spill everywhere..oops, my bad.
3. Miss Vickie's batter.  Don't think about it.  Just do it.
4. Don't be too excited about the fish & chips that you forget about your lemon/tartar sauce/slaw. :(
5. I don't think the owner will judge you if all you're able to do is stuff your face and moan \"omg.. it's so good\" over and over and over.  Either he doesn't judge or he didn't hear me.. haha.

My only suggestion for the owner (and I'm sure it probably has already been considered) would be for Fresco's to use plastic basket/trays to serve the food.  That's a bit more sustainable than paper boxes, can be re-used for dine-in customers, and allows us to see both fish & chips at the same time...and take pix and upload to yelp :)

I went to the UK this summer and tried fish & chips in many different places, but Fresco's has them all beat.  I cannot wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Best FnCh I've ever had, extra crispy cod is my regular. So good I always swap the chips for an extra piece. Hands down."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  Surprisingly some of the best poutine I've had in the city.  The staff and owner are so friendly, and the food comes out fast and delicious.  Never had a bad experience, and that is really saying something considering how many times we've got food from here."}
{"text":"My wife and I checked out the Kensington Market while in Toronto. Decided to try this place for lunch.

I ordered the Cod n' Chips, my wife the Crab Cakes n Chips. We were asked if we wanted sweet potato fries instead for no upcharge, and we both readily accepted.

Got one HUGE piece of cod. The fish itself was pretty good. The breading was awesome! Great flavor, and NOT at ALL too greasy. I'm from Wisconsin, and Fish Fries are a Friday staple in that region, and this is some of the best I've ever had!

Cole slaw it came with? Dunno, I don't like slaw usually, so I don't know good from bad. 
I thought the tartar sauce could use more relish, but decent.
Sweet potato fries came with a chipotle dipping sauce. They were quite good. Not overly greasy, not dried out.

My wife's crab cakes were also not at all too greasy. 3 large cakes that had melt in your mouth crab. She thought it was a lot of food for the price, more than she would've expected.

So we both loved it. Enough so that we walked back over from the park to tell the owner it was great. Glad we went there instead of Chinatown for lunch like we were thinking."}
{"text":"Awesome food here. Pure natural goodness.  Bruce Wayne should buy this place! The lady with tattoos has an awesome attitude and spirit. Keep up the great work. People like to eat in happy place.   Oh yea and the guy with the goatee and cap is a cool guy too. 

Solid food. Great price.  You'll enjoy this.  No regrets. L"}
{"text":"I've been hearing and reading about this place, so I gave it a try today. On the restaurants recommendation I tried the Haddock and Chips. I also opted for the Miss Vickie's extra crispy batter, and a root beer.

Everything was delicious. The fish was tender and juicy, and the fries were thick, some with the skins still on which is always good. Their patio is small, but great for the summer.

Just a note about the service:  Even though we sat outside and it's a \"self serve\" type of place, they bought the food out to us. When they noticed that we were looking for napkins, the cook ran outside to give us some. It's these small touches that make a big difference. 

This seems like the type of food that is best when eaten fresh, but it's still good enough that I will get delivery in the future."}
{"text":"The sweet potato fries are mutha f$&@ing delicious. You must get them with the extra thick batter. It makes all the difference and turns delicious fires in Outstanding fries. I ate all my fries before I even tasted the delicious halibut. 

Was looking for a great food spot to burn the rest of my Canadian money at before I caught my plane back to the states. Wanted poutine, but instead found this place and it receives my highest recommendation. Come and eat here. You won't be disappointed. I will definitely be coming back here if and when I return to Toronto."}
{"text":"Darn you Fresco's!!!!! 
You've ruined Fish and Chips for me!!!!

How can I go back to my fish and chips place back in LA and order the greasy, soggy battered cod and fries???  I want to cry when I think of your Miss Vickies, super crunchy batter!  The lobster po-boy with cheddar cheese was a pleasant surprise!  

The food is spectacular, the service was friendly and spot on, and they even offer WiFi! 

We are planning another trip to Toronto and hope to have some more of your delicious food!"}
{"text":"I got the cod with chips extra crispy. Pretty good portions. I love that you get to add the indian spice to it. Delicious! I am craving the cod while writing this. Sad I did not know that if you check into Yelp, you get a free pop. Definitely coming back to this place when I am in town."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I stopped by on our vacation in Toronto.  We took a cab into the neighborhood because we didn't feel like walking or driving from our hotel, which turned out to be smart because it was a pretty crowded street.  Lots of interesting, lively shops and fun people.  We grabbed a table outside at first because there was no available seating inside (it's a pretty tiny shop so it fills up fast), but as soon as a table inside cleared up, we went in.  The sun was glaring in our faces outside and there were a ton of bees.

The service was super friendly.  I don't know what possessed us to order so much food, but we ordered a large poutine and fish and chips.  The fish was delicious, although I wish they had malt vinegar available.  The fries were delicious, but I wasn't crazy about the gravy on the poutine.  It wasn't bad or anything, I just feel as though I've had better.  

Prices were good, and it was a nice experience.  I'll probably try a different spot for poutine next time I find myself in Toronto though."}
{"text":"3.5*  Only had the Mushroom Gravy poutine, will hafta come back + order actual fish & chips in order to give this place a \"real\" review!

After a last minute order change, I had the Mushroom Gravy poutine instead of the Quebec style - what I originally wanted.  The first thing that I tasted was the pepper in the sauce.  Cheese was already melted, no squeak.  Fries tasted good.  Again, I wished that I had the Quebec style first before anything \"fancier\".

There are 2 small tables, dine-in and a few more tables outdoors for the warmer weather!  Would definitely go back to try their fish...and other chips.  ;)"}
{"text":"the owner very humble and food was incredibly good.  def need to return more often."}
{"text":"It was my first time there and already planning to go again! Very good Fish & Chips and tasty coleslaw (I wish they gave more slaw though).  But overall, I like the food and place.  The place is modest and yet cozy.  I really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"All you need to know is that the poutine was AMAZE, and the people working their could not be friendlier!!! They answered all our tourist-y questions, and made great suggestions.My veg friend got the veggie chili poutine and that was delicious as well, the best be had. We couldn't finish it all- and ended up eating it later that night after dancing the night away. My brother got the fish (haddock) & chips and DAMN that was good."}
{"text":"Amazing place, if you're in Kensington Market, you have to stop by. Even if you're not coming here for a meal, which I definitely recommend, you should at least share a poutine or some snack things, like the lobster bites, with whoever you're with. Or all by yourself, because it's sooo good. Everything tastes light and fresh."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips I've had in the city. Not that I'm an expert or anything... but I've had my share of fish and chips at various pubs and whatnot. The owner is super friendly too, it makes for a great place to just relax and eat some great food.

Place is surprisingly clean for an establishment in a mildly sketchy (at night) neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Going to continue the trend of 5'ing this place.

It's small and simple but Fresco's had easily the best fish and chips I had in awhile, and I let the owner know that. 

We ordered Cod & Chips as well as the Shrimp & Chips. Both were served in well sized containers with sides of coleslaw, tartar sauce and chipotle sauce (you may have to ask for it, though.)

First off, there was very little grease in this meal. The battery was flaky but felt light and not heart-attack inducing. The fish was excellent and the shrimp were superb -- It's rare you can actually taste _the shrimp!_ while eating battered shrimp. I tried the Sweet Potato fries (no extra cost) and they were delightful, but the regular fries were great too. The total cost of the two meals plus an indie root beer came just over $20.

There is only seating for about 5 people in the entire place with some chairs outside but as others have recommended, go to the park for a great picnic.

Will gladly return to this joint."}
{"text":"Fantastic, wonderful! - casual hang, delicious fish & chips. What more do you need out of life?"}
{"text":"Haddock all 'round on a drizzly day for our little group! Skeptical visitor among us since one of us didn't even really care for fish and chips.The batter is light, I prefer not having to wade through batter.Also, two of us doesn't even like cole slaw,and it turned out delicious.The drinks,old school Pop Shoppe,haven't seen this soda in a long time.Brings back memories.Service was excellent given it was a slow week day for this visit.I can't imagine it would change even with a full house.Well, I can say all left satisfied.Will return to try other menu items...Here,or in Kensington."}
{"text":"Fresco's has some of the best fish and chips that I've had in the world. I can only think of a couple places in London where I enjoy the fare more.

The portions are huge and probably best suited for a hungry individual or pair. I opted for the cod. It was fresh, and I could still taste the fish (rather than some places where the fried batter overpowers the fish). I had mine with vinegar and the Indian chili spice blend which was provided. The blend wasn't spicy. The fries were crispy and freshly made.

I'd recommend Frescos as a stop at Kensington market. I'd rate it 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"It's a 4.5 because I didn't like the crab cakes, but given how nice they are and how amazing the halibut and fries were, it's a 5.

Pretty amazing. It's different from the one I had in the UK, but it's good in a different way. My Scottish Colleague swears by this place, though. As someone who cares about the sources of foods, I love how they manage to get Ocean-wise fish and Ontario Russet potatoes. I do wish they use beef tallow or duck fat for frying rather than vegetable oils, even though it drives the prices up. I make my own fries with duck fat, if I make my own fries.  (I think vegetable oils are very unhealthy especially in the deep fryer, but this won't drive the rating down because unfortunately all restaurants use vegetable oils. And tallow or duck fat fries are yummier! )

I can tell that the owner really cares about his business by how nice he is. It's winter and there are only so few seats inside the store, but he asked another patron to move over to a smaller table so I and my company can sit comfortably. At the end, he gave us a free sample of the sweet potato fries because he took a wrong order of someone else's. We totally appreciated that.

I am fairly disappointed by the crab cakes... it was the cheapest item on the menu but maybe I expected a French-style with lumps of crab meat in there rather than starch and I was wrong. I would've totally paid a couple more bucks for real crab meat. 

Other than that, the battered halibut was amazing. I liked the tartare sauce."}
{"text":"Fresh fish! Lightly breaded !
So so fries, somewhat burnt.. Not my style !
Reasonable price!
Not a lot of seats available specially on weekends.
Overall a 4/5 !

Oh, check in on Yelp to get a free pop with your meal."}
{"text":"VIBE 
It's small but great patio! 
I wanted to tell the lady at the counter to \"turn her frown upside down.\" She wasn't the most pleasant that day. 

I ATE 
Straight up halibut. Of course, it doesn't come as part of the mini-fish and chip combo they have (which is a great idea at $5 by the way). So two pieces of halibut and a drink cost me $13. NOT CHEAP. But it was delicious! Way delicious. Crispy but not too fried. Just soft, soft halibut with a healthy dose of tartar sauce and some coleslaw. 

Dining companions had the poutine. Big,big portions for about $7.50 (again, not cheap). I had a taste and that gravy is thick and salty. Just the way I like it! 
Secret: they have a butter chicken poutine that's not on the menu. I want to go to there. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
The service could be a bit better (I've heard great things about the owner) but the fish stands up. Super fresco."}
{"text":"I decided to try fresco's after reading all the positive reviews on Yelp, and I'm glad I did!  

Decided to go with the Haddock & Chips, and was curious about the \"Miss Vickies extra crisp batter\" so I decided to have 1 of 2 pieces of fish covered in the special batter.  One regular, one Miss Vickies. The texture of the special batter make it worth the extra dollar.  It was damn tasty (granted, so was the piece with regular batter)!  Also helped that the fish itself was perfectly cooked, moist, and well proportioned.
The chips that accompanied the meal were also very good.  Nothing frozen here, and the portion of fries was quite large!!

If you're eating here with a friend, I'd recommend getting a single order of fish 'n' chips, then simply adding fish for the second person.  You'll save a lot of money if you split the fries...of which there are more than enough for two!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourite finds lately. It is a small place with only three tables so if you come at lunch time, chances are that you will have to buy it as a take out. 

Other than that, the food is amazing. I had the lobster bites (which comes with fries), poutine and chili. The lobster bites were my favourite. It was made to order and was very tasty though not sure how much lobster was in it. The fries were just like any other fries so the poutine, though had really good cheese curds and gravy, was ok. However, the service is superb and friendly and I'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Fresco's has the best fish and chips I've ever eaten! Try the haddock -- it's fantastic, especially with the extra-crispy batter. (You'd think that the potato chips in the batter would make it greasy, but it doesn't taste that way at all. In fact, compared to every other fish & chips I've tried, I'm surprised by just how un-greasy both types of batter taste. It's almost like a good tempura.) The poutine is also pretty good, though the fries are quite excellent even by themselves.

Aside from the food, I really appreciate the restaurant's environmental awareness (several of the items have the Ocean Wise seal of approval) as well as their involvement here on Yelp. It's clear that they care a lot about their product. The Beatles stuff on the walls is really nice (especially the poster!) and gives the restaurant a very personal sort of vibe.

If you like good food, this place is definitely worth your attention!"}
{"text":"They put the chips in fish & chips! Ask for the Miss Vickie's extra crisp option and you will not regret it. One of the first places I've seen add actual chips to the batter and it's absolutely delicious. Somehow they are able to make the fish not feel heavy and still hold its taste. Also suggest to upgrade your fries to poutine. They add a healthy portion of cheese and the gravy is also good. The difference maker for the poutine is that all the cheese is nicely melted throughout the entire poutine unlike most places where you get to the end and it's all cold. Overall great place and one of the best fish and chips I've ever had!"}
{"text":"In the mood for some fish and chips for lunch one day, my friend suggested this place and we went to get our fix. The shop did not disappoint: the place has a very old neighbourhood shop feel, if you know what I mean. Like, the owners have been around for a while, probably know a lot customers by name, that sort of thing. It's a small establishment, with a few tables outside where you can sit and watch the colourful characters walk by :) I loved seeing the hippies and hipsters, both look like they belong here.

We ordered the Haddock and chips. It was really good. For $12 bucks or so, there were two big pieces of crispy battered fish, a whole lot of fries and a pop. Decent price for all the food you get. I was barely able to eat my fries, I was so full ! I'll know for next time to go without having breakfast :)  They also serve cod, if memory serves me right - that's what I want to try the next time I go! 

I also loved all the Beatles posters and pictures on the wall :) Any place that displays their love for John, Paul, George and Ringo AND serves good food, is a win in my book! :)"}
{"text":"Yum! This delightful establishment tucked into Kensington was worth the time. The place was clean and staff were very friendly and inviting. Their selection was vast and the food was great! They also don't skimp out on the portions which is a big plus in my books!"}
{"text":"Dang.

Fresco's just made my heart smile. DOUBLE CRISPY. Just do it. Everything in life should be double crispy. Haddock is $10.95 and comes with chips but for just $2 more you can poutine that sh*t. Awww yeah.

I did the lobster poboy- $7.95. I'm from New Orleans and a complete a**hole about poboys. If I was being my jerk self, I'd say... y'all, this isn't a poboy... it's not dressed correctly and the bread isn't authentic. If I was being real, I'd say that's one tasty sandwich. I could have handled a little more zip in the chipotle mayo though. Also, $8 for a lobster sandwich? That's a bargain right thurr.

Great service. Delicious food. Tasty to the max."}
{"text":"While I love fish and chips, good shrimp and chips are sadly much more difficult to come by. Finally though, Fresco's has got it right. Jumbo, juicy shrimp are enrobed in a light, crispy batter and sided with fresh, thick cut fries and house made coleslaw. My friend's haddock and chips was a long moist filet and reported to be excellente as well. Other tantalizing menu items I will definitely be back to try include the crab cakes and chips and sweet potato fries. 

The small store is a sparsely decorated Beatles shrine, playing only Beatles music. The jolly owner is a proud environmentalist who uses nothing but cornstarch based cutlery and biodegradable boxes. Condiments can be pumped from a bulk container if eating immediately, but those who are taking their food away also have the packaged ketchup and vinegar (both white and malt) option too. There are even different garbage cans to sort your biodegradables and waste into.

There are only a few tables (and even a cute but awkwardly low wicker two-seater) out front to sit at, but as long as the weather is nice, Bellevue park is but a step across the street away to have your Fresco's al fresco."}
{"text":"It's all been said already, but this place is great.

The extra crispy with Miss Vickie's chips makes for a light, flaky and super crispy batter - genius!

Cod is more on the moist and fishy side, Haddock more dry and sweet, Halibut is firm and dense, but just not worth the extra $6.

Super nice guys.

Olde York was my old fave, now I have 2 faves... as they are very different and excellent in their own ways.

Will be back again."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!
IM A TOTAL FAN

Not only is it a family business but its at my fav place kensington market.
The man on cash, who I assume to be the owner is super personable and clearly loves what he does.
I mean it shows in the food and the service.
I went on a weekday evening after work cause I was starved. 
Best time to go as the street is empty so prime parking without the congestion you get on weekends. 
I ordered a lobster po boy w a side of fries.
I looove french fries and there's are perfect. thick cute and fried w a nice crisp on the outside as they should be.
the lobster po boy was also great. The bread was soft and lobster was tasty. I did feel like the sandwich was missing aioli sauce or something to give it that extra kick.
my partner got the chicken sandwich , which he obviously loved since he inhaled it in seconds lol
I will be back to try the fish and chips and get my crab cake lol ( the owner knows what I'm talking about)
Oh and a free drink with check in, I mean you cant go wrong w FREE lol"}
{"text":"I am a pig and I love practicing gluttony here. Large poutine + fish po'boy + ginger beer = heaven (oddly, I thought glutton was a sin). I usually hate coleslaw but the stuff they make is out of this world! In any case, I've tried most things on the menu and can recommend all but the mozza sticks. For the poutine, they offer Daiya and mushroom gravy to make it vegan.

I don't eat here enough, but for good reasons. I am always bursting full and happy after."}
{"text":"This place is uber delish!
All the comments were bang on, had the lobster po boy AND cod fish & chips. Yes that's 2 meals for just one person but couldn't just pick one! The cod had been battered in both styles, one regular and other extra crispy (they're cool like that there). Loved the mild-medium spicy mayo zip on the po boy, the fresh cut fries are legit and still taste really good after they're cold. Better fries than many chip trucks found up north to camping trips!

Place inside is small though, 4x 2 seater tables and bench at window. Outside patio is bigger than inside and NO washroom 

Would eat here again and recommend to friends for sure"}
{"text":"I came here for the poutine and it was DELICIOUS! It's large enough to share with others."}
{"text":"If you love fish and chips, you are going to love this place.  The batter is just PERFECT and the fries are FRESH. I am a long time fish and chips fan, and am always up for a good meal - and Fresco's was a good meal and a good deal. It is small, little seating, but don't let that deter you. It is well worth the trip. I met the owner while I was there, Michael.  Nice guy. And he was talking to the regulars as if they were family."}
{"text":"In typical Kensington fashion, it's a very small place with a few seats indoors and some out doors. It does take quite a while to get your food and I'm not sure if it's worth it. On one hand, the fish had a light and crispy batter so you really do get to taste the amazingly delicious fish. On the other hand, there was a very generous portion of fries that were super dry."}
{"text":"If you like super crispy batter I'd recommend you go with the Ms. Vickie's batter, it's original batter + crushed Ms. Vickie's Salt and Vinegar chips :D. The original batter was alright, but kinda thin and wasn't what I'm used to. The fries are meh, mine were not crispy at all. The quality of the fish was excellent as it was moist and flakey! The coleslaw was very refreshing and probably more authentically homemade than those that are drowned in mayo. Unfortunately, I didn't find my lemon wedge until the very end :(

The girl who took my order was a little off putting but the owner (?) was super nice.

I think a nice bonus of this place is the fact that they use biodegradable take out boxes and cutlery and are diligent in disposing of them properly. Even if it's just to appeal to the neighbourhood, I think it's a great initiative.

I'll definitely be back, probably just for the fish though. I wonder if they do that...yum. Went back, they definitely do serve just the fish :) got the Ms. Vickie's jalapeno batter this time ;)"}
{"text":"I had haddock and fires and crab cakes several times here. It is - yes - probably one of the best fish and chips in town, but it is not that special.
The services are friendly and great."}
{"text":"Unreal fish and chips. Most reviews say they're not greasy but let's be real, it's fish and chips with the perfect amount if greasy. My only regret is I should have gotten the Halibut. Enjoy mates!!"}
{"text":"I tried their haddock with chips, cod with their miss vickie's batter, quebec poutine and deep fried shrimps. 

Overall, both the fish are lacking a bit of salt but the shrimps were amazingly fresh and delicious. The quebec poutine had a good balance of cheese curds and gravy.

I would highly recommend anyone who's coming to Fresco's Fish & Chips must try their deep fried shrimps!"}
{"text":"My sisters and I planned on visiting Kensington Market and have dinner there but when we got there is was around 7:00pm and a lot of shops were closing we decided on going to get fish & chips I have heard they have one of the best in Toronto. We all ordered 2 pieces of haddock and fries it was about $12.95 you have the option of fried regular or crispy I had regular. When we got the food it was so delicious I didn't even want it to end. They know how to throw down a great fish and chips and i will definitely be coming back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Went in today on the way , got the 2 piece halibut with sweet potato fries, shrimp po boy with extra chipotle dipping sauce & coleslaw. The Shrimp po boy was ok, I felt that it would've been better with a bit more seasoning. The fish was so bland. Neither the batter or the fish itself was seasoned at all. Thank god for the tartar sauce, it was so good, and frankly, save the fish. The coleslaw & chipotle dipping sauce was also very good.

If I had to compare the shrimp poboy to Buster's Sea Cove, this poboy fails. 

Overall, I enjoyed the sides more than the main courses. I would go again but I would just order all the sides and go find another fish and chips place lol.

Also, friendly service cleanliness is always a plus. I went during lunch and there were a bunch of annoying kids in there."}
{"text":"Best place for fish and chips I've tryed on Toronto. We found this place using yelp otherwise probably never would of. They also give you a free pop when you mention the sight which was an added bonus :)"}
{"text":"Just got a delivery from here, it was amazing! I would show a picture but we ate it all. We got the cod fish with the Ms Vicky batter, poutine, and a po boy sandwich. The delivery came in just a little over 30 minutes and came piping hot.  

Best food ever.  Especially for a hangover."}
{"text":"My friends and I, in total of 3 people, ordered 2 haddock fish and chips for sharing. The chef was so nice that he gave us 1 fish for free so all of us can have their own fish. Fish was super moist and juicy. Definitely go back again. The place is spacious and good for groups."}
{"text":"I came into Fresco's with big expectations and admittedly low experience in the fish and chips department. I was met with courteous and friendly service from beginning to end. The owner was quite chatty. 

The fish itself was noticeably fresh and quite tasty. The \"traditional\" is very lightly battered. My personal preference is for the heavy, crispier batter variety. I suppose I am to blame for choosing  traditional over crispy. The chips were abundant but on the sloppy side. I am assuming that they are not fried up with every order like the fish is. 

I was not a fan of their serving format. Eating out of a box was uncomfortable and frustrating. The box is compartmentalized; with the fish atop separated from the chips below by a paper. Cutting into the fish with a knife ripped the paper that was already structurally compromised from absorbing the oil from the fish. I would have preferred the simple plate system. The knife and fork method of eating was perhaps not well fitted for this occasion."}
{"text":"We ate here a few times and the fish and chips are da bomb. Perhaps one of the best haddock in Toronto. Their chips (fries, for North Americans) are pretty good too. Just a bit away from the heart of Kensington Market but still within minutes. It's across the street from a little park. They have a small patio so enjoy it while the good weather is here. They also deliver. Pro-tip: No washrooms. Pro-tip 2: Avoid the park, it's not exactly clean."}
{"text":"When I was a kid I hated Fish & Chips. Soemthign about the batter and the fish made me so sick inside. I had a similar issue with cheesecake.

Now as an adult (arguable) I have come to enjoy both these items i once hated.

This is a small Fish and Chip shop in kensington market. The first time we ate these chips we had had a bit too much of the green stuff and had INSANE munchies. Beign that we were too busy watching tv and unfucntionable...we decided to order from them! BONUS! They deliver right to me in the harbourfront. The guy who delivered (within 30 minutes) was super cool, even though im sure he laughed at the smells emerging from our condo unit once i opened the door. 

We got the extra crispy Ms. Vickies battered fish and chips (one cod and 1 haddock) both were DELICIOUS. We were in love. Best fish in chips in life.

The 2nd time we were actually in the are and decided to order and eat on their patio. I made hte mistake of ordering too much only because I realzied how HUGE these portions are and that realistically i could have shared it *but side note: my husband doesnt like to share food*. Anyways, still amazing, still fantastic and sooo tasty.

I have no need to venture onto other places to try Fish & Chips. This place delivers when I cant make it there and the food is fresh, tasty, and generous in size.

BUT make sur eyou order extra crispy. you can thank me later ;)"}
{"text":"this place is hidden in Kennsington market and is super small. if you want the wall seats you will need to do a dinner table hurdle over another table. Aside from that this fish n' chip place has some pretty crispy (in a good way) batter. loved it. fries were pretty mediocre i did like the indian chill powder on them though. I always get the Cod and chips. i usually come at lunch so not that busy but i can see this place filling up real fast."}
{"text":"The fish and chips are amazing, also highly recommend the crabcake poboy! Would definitely go back. Side note though, they don't have a bathroom."}
{"text":"There are too many fish and chip places in Toronto for me to decisively call Fresco's the best in the city, but it's certainly the best I've encountered.  Nobody knows their fryer as well as Michael Fresco; everything is cooked perfectly, with a minimum of grease and perfect flavors.  The haddock's light and fluffy, the cod's a bit sharper in flavor and flakes under your fork, and the halibut is delicate, mild, and meaty.  Fresco's offers a traditional batter or one crisped up with Miss Vicky's potato chips, and I highly endorse the latter. You get that crunchy texture with a very thin coating of batter, and everything is properly drained to keep oiliness down to an absolute minimum.  

The fried shrimp are light and tender, the crab cakes are flavorful if not a bit mundane, and the lobster bites are a tasty novelty.  The fries are great, and the option to upgrade them to poutine is highly appreciated - Fresco's poutine is made with a solid gravy and melty, delicious cheese curds with a fair amount of pleasant squeak to them.  Avoid the dairy, lactose, gluten, and casein free Daiya option, which is like eating cheese if cheese hated you and everyone you loved.

The chicken wings are cooked really nicely here, but the one time I had them they were small, and I received a lame, mild barbecue sauce instead of the buffalo sauce I ordered.  The wings are the only thing I wouldn't order here.  

The service is minimal but friendly, and the seating is sparse but clean.  When I want fish and chips this is where I go.  I should probably explore some other places, but when the food's this good it's tough to pry myself away."}
{"text":"Always get the extra crispy haddock with sweet potato fries and it is perfect!"}
{"text":"One of the best places for Fish and Chips. The Miss Vickie's batter is worth it.
makes sense, from the slaw  to the tarter sauce. Nice and simple the way it should be. Keep it up."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

On one of the hottest afternoon this summer, my friend insisted on coming to Fresco's Fish & Chips.

Remember to Check In on your Yelp App to claim your free drinks with any entrees! Fresco's is just so Yelp Friendly!

Halibut and Chips ($13.99) with half regular and half Miss Vickie's chip batter. The extra crispy batter definitely extra tasty! The 2 piece of fish though on the small side but with all these chips (fries), it can be filling!

If you are in the Kensington Market area and you have craving for Fish and Chips. Fresco's definitely worth coming to!"}
{"text":"The best fish and chips I've ever had! Pay the extra $0.75 for the Ms Vickies extra crispy batter. It's worth it, trust me. 

I've tried the haddock and the cod and prefer the haddock. As stated by the man taking my order, the cod has more of a fishy taste. The haddock is also their most popular choice. I've tried the Chili (both meat and vegetarian) and it's good comfort food. 

The order is quite filling and could potentially be split between two. I can finish the fish easy but always have a difficult time eating all the fries. If you're sharing for two I suggest buying one order and just buying an extra fish for splitting. I'll try the sandwiches next time if I can resist ordering the fish and chips again!"}
{"text":"One of the best fish & chips and clam chowder I've ever had. The owner was super nice and service was excellent !"}
{"text":"This was a great fish & chips, with super friendly service! We especially enjoyed the \"extra crispy\" batter made with crushed potato chips. Will definitely return when back in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Super pumped when this location opened - I like a plate of fish and chips on Good Friday and the options uptown are super lacking. But now there are two on St. Clair W! Fantastic crispy haddock and a nice atmosphere. Not too busy even on the holiday. :)"}
{"text":"Friendly place with really good tasting food. I asked for a recommendation on which fish to get and I was not disappointed with the haddock. I also upgraded the chips to the poutine which was great.very few places do a classic poutine like this anymore."}
{"text":"The only place il go for fish and chips in toronto. The staff here is super nice and like to kick up a conversation while you're waiting for the food. 

The miss vickies chip batter is a total killer move on their end (in a good way)

Love everything about this place"}
{"text":"This has to be, without doubt, probably the best Fish and Chips in all of the City of Toronto.  I've eaten in many places (Golden Griddle has amazing fish and chips and also Off The Hook) and I would also give them equally five stars.  But oh my God, once I tried Fresco's, I feel in love with the food right away.   I've loved fish and chips since I was a child, and to try Fresco's not only brought me back to my childhood, but the food was just amazing.  

Give their Vickies cripsy batter a try, it is EPIC and delicious.  I don't remember having fish and chips this good.

Even the original batter is totally EPIC as well - it is a nice crisp and also melts in your mouth.

I will be going back here again, I guarantee it.  I highly recommend Fresco's.  It is a very small diner, but it has huge, huge taste and the Fish and Chips are Phenomenal.  

Also try out the Quebec Poutine, it is truly delicious!"}
{"text":"Nice small fish place in Kensington - I've been here 3 times now and the fish is very tasty (especially the halibut) and the prices are fair. It's more a take-out place in my mind since it's so small, so if you're looking to grab and go it's perfect!"}
{"text":"Great place.. Fresh meals. The oil was a bit old tasting when i had my meal at 9pm on Sunday. Perhaps it's the end of the day?
Otherwise great vibe and place for sure"}
{"text":"Very tasty tartar sauce, although I wasn't a fan of the 'extra crispy' breaded fish."}
{"text":"Super friendly service. The fish is fresh with a nice lighter batter and there's a good amount of fish. Greta poutine as well. The portions are large. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We were devoted chippy's to the fish place (Somethin's Fishy) that occupied the space taken over by Fresco's so we were anxious about a new owner. This review is long overdue, as we have been enjoying it for some time now. 

Gladly, the food continues to be delicious and the simple fish & chips menu was expanded to include vegan friendly options. The place is a small hole in the wall on Augusta that puts out the best fish & chips in the area. The local competition is of course Harbord Fish & Chips was is consistently heavier and greasier. Of course the star of any fish & chip place is the fish & chips and they are delicious. We have tried many of the options and the batter for the fish is light and airy and never too greasy and the fries are always consistently yummy. The attention to detail by the staff always makes for a great meal. Included with every meal is a lemon a must for any fish dish and tartar sauce. Although they have limited indoor seating it makes for great take away or a lunch/dinner outside on their patio."}
{"text":"Amazing!! My bf got the cod, one in Miss Vicky's batter and other normal. I tasted both and Miss Vicky's batter took the cake. It was crispy but not burned, fish was tender and flakey. I decided to try the shrimp po-boy, it wasn't the same as the \"authentic\" version, this one had chesse, coleslaw and was on toasted ciabatta, but it was great nonetheless. Shrimp was big and juicy, not those lame tiny ones. We noticed they were making the food as it was ordered (the chef even opened a brand new bag of Ms Vicky's for the order), I think this helps with everything tasting amazing. 

We also had to order the poutine since there's been so much talk about it. Fries were perfectly cooked. Gravy was done right; not too heavy, not too light, not too salty. It would have been nice to get more gravy & cheese though. By the time you got close to the bottom of the box, there were just plain fries. 

Other notes:
- Barely any seating inside. 
- Owner was incredibly nice. 

Note to Owner: If you decide you want to change your po-boy bread to something a little more \"authentic\", Silverstein's makes a \"weiner bun\" that's pretty close to NOLA Style French Bread."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect!!! This is place is a must GO!  The owner is so sweet and the food is really good, if you are around, go ahead and give it a try. You wont regret!!"}
{"text":"My bf loves fish and chips and has been complaining about not being able to find a good place for them. Finally after months first hearing about this place from a friend we decided to go check it out. I read reviews on how it's small inside but when i saw the place it is REALLY small. Unfortunately it was a little rainy and chilly or else we would've sat on the patio because the 2 tables were occupied already. We decided to order 2 cod and chips, 1 traditional and 1 with miss vickies batter, and both upgraded to a poutine. After trying both batters, my bf and i both agreed we liked the traditional batter because it was crispier and the miss vickies batter was a little chewy, probably due to eating in the car and getting a little bit soggy. However, the fish to batter ratio was great. Portion was smaller than i expected but still good enough to be full. I'm not great at judging poutine unless it's super bad but my bf said it was good and i did like how they layered the gravy and cheese throughout instead of just the top. The service was great because they were very friendly and inside was nicely and uniquely decorated. If i was close by in the area craving fish and chips/poutine then i'd definitely come by. Need to try the po boy! but also dying to try seven lives in kensington as well!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best fish & chips in Toronto, this is the place to go! The service and food were both phenomenal."}
{"text":"Very, very nice. This place came highly recommended by a friend and it lived up to the hype!

I like to get haddock with onion rings. The fries are decent but the extra flavour of the onion rings can't be beat! I've heard great things about their poutine too but I haven't managed to convince myself to be that \"bad\" yet, though why fried fish and onion rings are so much better that I feel comfortable getting them, I don't know. :P

I prefer haddock because I find halibut (the favourite of my friend who considers himself a fish & chips connoisseur) too dense and cod too delicate. Haddock has the perfect texture because it's right in between and because I think it has a great fish (but not fishy!) flavour. 

The add on for Miss Vickie's extra crispy batter is also totally worth it! Absolutely delicious and adds a great crunch. I normally shy away from salt &  vinegar chips but I think it goes really well with the fish. 

Delicious and a must-eat in Toronto, in my opinion!"}
