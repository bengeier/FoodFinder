{"text":"Service: One of a kind arts and crafts studio here in MTL, for the little ones and for their not so little companions. Come here for hours of creativity and fun, without the cleaning hassle! It's great for a date night, a chill afternoon with girlfriends or a fun day with family.  You choose the items that you want to decorate, then paint it, and leave it here for baking. No worries for the not so gifted ones, there are tons of drawing that you can choose to imprint on your items. And while you are here, you can sip on a drink at the same time~  Value: Very reasonable for such a fun activity that leaves you a valuable memory in a week!  Ambiance: Spread on 2 floors, big spaces! Every tables is set with enough \"weapons\" to create the art piece of your dreams. Expect it to be not so quiet when they are kids around as this is a very family-oriented place."}
{"text":"The staff is great, very helpful and friendly.   A little on the pricey side, pay attention to the rules, only the basic colors and tools are are included in the hourly rate, that's what turned me off a little. All in All a good time."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. I actually loved it!! The amount of choice of pottery to paint was unbelieveable! I really wasn't expecting that. The staff were helpful, and it was fairly priced. I would love to come back! The only downpoint is I have to wait 8 days to get my pottery back, I wish I could get it sooner!   Also, a bonus is if you want more colours, that are not originally provided the staff will bring them to you with no extra charge. Fab. GREAT afternoon activity!"}
{"text":"Je ne suis pas la personne la plus à l'aise pour les travaux manuels, mais le café céramique est un café très spécial ou l'on ne voit plus le temps passé. J'ai passé quelques heures à peindre de jolie bols autours d'un café avec des amis et leurs enfants. Quelle expérience, je crois que j'ai eu plus de fun que les enfants!"}
{"text":"Tres bel endroit pour passer un moment en famille, entre amis ou même en couple. J'y suis allée avec ma fille de 7 ans mais ce soir là il y avait principalement des couples d'âges très variés. Le lieu est très propre et assez recent, bien décoré. Il y a un café pour commander à manger et à boire et on peut peindre tout en se restaurant. Beaucoup de choix de figurines ou objets à décorer et beaucoup de choix de peinture et pinceaux aussi.  J'avais visité d'autres lieu sur ce même concept mais celui-ci est de loin le plus propre et le plus complet. On ne se croirait pas dans un lieu juste prévu pour des fêtes d'enfants (même si les fins de semaine ils en organisent)."}
{"text":"I will absolutely do this again; it was a great time with friends. So much fun and it is so satisfying to get your finished product a week later.  Painted a large bowl and ordered a coffee with a banana bread. For 3 hours of painting and eating, it was about $75 which is not cheap but it was definitely worth it! I did buy a large item to paint and they do have smaller items for cheaper.  I'm not a very creative person in general and this was a great way to try to be more so."}
{"text":"Best activity any time of the year and day in Montreal. So many pieces to choose from to paint. Plenty of materials to paint and get really crafty. Order food and paint with your friends. A very fun and different outing with friends or family. And you get to take home your glazed ceramic piece! Great souvenir of my trip to Montreal"}
{"text":"We have many places like this in the states and they're much better organized and it's a much easier experience especially when you're bringing small children. In the end everything worked out well but they can probably do a little bit better on the workflow. Certainly would help if we spoke French as the one person on staff only spoke a few words of English. Also it's rare we order a coffee beverage and is so gross we toss it. Cappuccino was undrinkable."}
{"text":"Sooo much fun!   Would come here again and again. Definitely not cheap. Came with 4 people; we all paints, ate, and three of us outdated drinks. It came to about $160. I think it is definitely worth the experience. It was a ton of fun and I cannot wait to see what my Ceramic painting ends up looking like.   I painted a beer mug. Ill post a picture when I get it. All of the ceramics take 10 days to be cooked and ready for pickup. You can pay $5 for a speedy preparation but we are just going to wait.   There's a huge variety of what to paint. Plates, jars, planting jars, mugs, cups, salt and pepper shakers, egg holders, decorations and SO much more. I didn't think the ceramics were expensive. I got a pretty large beer mug and it was only $19 or $20. Really not bad.   It is $8 per person to paint until the 3 hour mark. Then it is free. I guess that's where it gets expensive but again still totally worth it.   I ordered the tuna panini with eggplant (no olives). I thought it was pretty good considering we're not at a reallllll restaurant. I really enjoyed my panini. It comes with a side of Tostito chips and salsa (which I didn't finish) and carrots, celery, and cucumber with ranch dressing. I also ordered a cappuccino. I should add one detail that was not too awesome... There are no English menus! Not too fond of that.   So the waitress put in all four orders of food and somehow along the line my dads food was forgotten about!!! So when we reminded them, they gave us two free chocolate chip cookies with his food. Was a very cute effort to make up for a slight mistake.   It was a great overall experience. I think this place is awesome for any ages! I came with my older brother and parents for my moms birthday! There were younger couples and families with little kids. It's for everyone! So much fun and definitely recommend it for everyone to try."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I really feel about this location.  To give you an idea how how expensive this place can get my best friend, myself, and our 2 three year old children went to paint ceramic. The cost of the 4 of us to buy a ceramic item, sit and paint for 2 hours, and to each have a beverage (2 coffees and 2 bottles of water) was $153.00  I found that they should really work on explaining exactly how the program works or to have someone come by and let you know how much time you have been there. They offer a set price for kids and adults if you stay past two hours. We were there for 1 hour and 45 minutes and they wouldn't give us the discount.  Anyway, you walk through the store and pick out what piece you'd like to paint, an employee comes up to your table and writes down the codes for everything you have and explains to you the process of how everything works, how many coats of paint you should use, how to \"erase\" any errors you might make while painting, and shows you the wall with other paint colors and additional brushes.  I wish they would explain the different techniques to get different looks, this is explained on a laminated sheet on the table but it is only in french so if you can't read French you are up a creek!  Just a tip for you if you are going with YOUNG children:  Don't bother getting the nice ceramic pieces like a fairy, princess, or Hello Kitty. Go with a mug or plate and let them go to town. They'll be thrilled just to be painting that they will mix, over mix, and remix colors on the same spot!"}
{"text":"My friend and I and had passed this place several times and decided to try it out one weekend as it looked fun.  The cafe has two floors. Their menu is basic and food is decent. Service is very friendly! We were more satisfied with the painting part of the experience.  We were guided through the process as soon as we were seated. We were told to head upstairs to pick what we wanted to paint, and they have a lot of options of ceramics to pick from!  I picked a rabbit and was advised to layer the paint on several coats to get the best effect later. Which means you spend a few hours here so take time out accordingly. It's a nice place to just relax and paint, however it's a little pricey. Also once you are done, they take your painted ceramic for a week to glaze and fire it in the kiln.  May not go here again, but for a one time thing, it was a fun experience."}
{"text":"Friendly and laid back. We came here and painted a mug. Both of us did it and they charged us as if we were just one person. It's $8 an hour plus the cost of the ceramics, but they have a special $12 flat deal for 3 hours of painting. You'll need to be in the city for a while, though, because it takes a week for them to glaze and fire the pieces!"}
{"text":"This is where you go to paint a ceramic piece. So the way it works you buy a ceramic item (8$-100$) plus you pay a fee per hour per person. Depending how long you stay there, and how big your piece is, it does get really expensive.   They do offer food, I am not sure I would trust anyone handling pottery with sandwiches or wraps, but they do have drinks and a outrageous price for a can of juice or coke.   Go for the pottery, but not the food, eat a good meal before, then you can go and paint, and go eat again after."}
{"text":"Nice place to spend time with your loved one. The price is a bit costy, but worth it if it's for a special event"}
{"text":"What a fun way to spend an afternoon! This place is surprisingly big. There are a lot of choices of ceramics to paint. Not artistically talented? That's ok too, some items are pretty hard to mess up, like the penguin cookie jars and hello kitty plate. All the paint and brushes are furnished. You pay by the hour and after 3 hrs, it becomes a daily rate. You also pay for the item you paint.   Just remember that you have to paint the ceramic with three layers (the paint dries fast though), so allot your time accordingly. Also, if you plan on doing very fine detailed work, you may want to bring your own very fine brushes as theirs all flare out at the tip.   It's also a cafe so you could eat and drink while painting. Or just go for a cup of coffee with friends and not paint..."}
{"text":"My grandmother's a hobbyist painter and we thought it'd be a cute idea to bring the girls out here for her 80th birthday. I called a few days in advance and made a two hour reservation. The pieces are a little pricey ($2-3 above average), but the environment was great, the place was quite quiet for a Saturday afternoon and the drinks we ordered were great. The staff was super helpful and friendly-enough. They helped us figure out colors, tracing, and got us everything we needed. They are primarily french speakers, so English-only tourists beware there are a few language barriers but all in all had a great time and my less than enthused grandmother actually enjoyed herself, which is very rare! Can't wait to go back and pick up our stuff!"}
{"text":"Trés bons concept, mais mauvaise ambiance et lieu non adapté (trop petit pour le nom de d'adultes grincheux adeptes des après-midi ennuyeuses )."}
