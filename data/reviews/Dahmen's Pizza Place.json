{"text":"Really good cracker thin crust pizza. It's a great place to go to just relax, eat pizza and hang with friends. It has the neighborhood pizza joint vibe that most would like.  There breadsticks are really good."}
{"text":"Stopped in one night during my business trip and had a medium pizza. Overall, it was ok -- but man did it remind me of Digiorno pizza, just cooked a in a better oven.   Establish was nice, watched a soccer game and staff was friendly. Just not the best pizza."}
{"text":"Two words, Great Pizza! I have been in Dahmen's multiple times.   There lunch buffet is great. They always have fresh pizzas out and a good variety as well.   When I order delivery it takes the normal 30 min to arrive so not bad at all.  I also like how they have the bar. Pizza and beer, what could be better right? There beer prices are very competitive as well. Dahmen's buffet over Pizza Hut buffet!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and I always enjoy it. I like the laid back  atmosphere and how you pay at the counter and serve yourself. The lunch rush is pretty large with a lot of high school students but that also ensures there's new, fresh pizza's being brought out to keep up with the rush. There's a huge variety of pizza's and also cinnamon sticks, breadsticks, salad bar, lasagna, Mac n cheese, and soups. The staff is very friendly, as well.   I definitely recommend trying the buffet out! You can serve yourself at your own pace so whether you're in a hurry or not, you can be in and out or you can stay and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Not bad!!  We went during Friday rush and had our pick of tables. They were operating on a \"seat yourself, come to the bar and order\" type style.   I ordered the fish fry and my boyfriend got a 10\" pizza. The menu was informative and provided prices for everything.   The fish fry was just slightly better than pulling high-quality fish sticks out of my own oven. There were 2 pieces. It was okay! Skinny fries, small portions.  As far as pizza, the toppings and sauce were good, the crust kind of seemed like dense saltines. Better than the fish, and I stole 2 pieces.   This place gets three stars because the staff was super friendly and accommodating, service and food was quick."}
{"text":"Alright, I don't want to be short here honestly but... all I have to say is Dessert sticks and all you can eat pizza buffet.... What more can you say? and the different types of pizzas? UGH sooooo goooood... It isn't anywhere really special but you better believe it is well worth any money spent..."}
{"text":"Best pizza in all of Madison!  The buffet is a great deal.  BBQ Chicken pizza is phenomenal!  Riley and Tyler are the best!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!! The pizza is ridiculously good. I'm a Madison native, who lived in NYC, and just moved back and am SO happy to find a place with good THIN crust pizza. You really get a taste for the cheese and the sauce...which is my favorite part of pizza, but if you prefer loads of bread and crust then stear clear. I've only been for the lunch buffet, which clearly isn't staffed super well, but I definitely wouldn't complain in any way!"}
{"text":"Clearly this is one of the top 6 pizza places in town. The fish fry is good too and they also have some expertise in the barbecue pork department. The parking is free, the staff is friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Always a joy to come here.  The owners do a fantastic job making you feel welcome."}
{"text":"It took awhile for them to make our pizza, but when it came out it was really good!  Relaxed sports bar atmosphere.  Pricing is reasonable.  The storefront looks about a hundred years old, they could really use a fresh awning.  As pizza places go, this one is overall decent.  Plenty of parking, friendly service, and lovely thin crust pizza"}
{"text":"When I order a pizza for carryout, don't tell me it will be 15 minutes if you meant 45.  On the bright side, my wife really liked the pizza.  I'm not a big thin crust lover, and the pizza wasn't anything special.  It reminds me of the little cash only joints back at home where there was other \"business\" in the back.  The sauce is the best part of the pizza in that it's used lightly and has good flavor.  The breadsticks are amazingly good.  I think if I'd had better service, I'd have given 3 stars, but sitting there waiting for a lukewarm pizza really left a bad taste in my mouth for this place."}
{"text":"So we checked out this pizza place.  Used to be another business (Pizza Oven) which was awesome.  The pizzas are similar to the old ones, but a little different and definitely not as good. (Thats why the current website takes you to the old owner's website)  The only plus to new ownership is the LOW pitcher prices ($6 capital amber, spotted cow, etc)  The reason they get 1 star is service....simply AWEFUL!  The hostess/waitress Diana is a terrible excuse for a worker.  The new setup is so messed up, you order at the front counter/hostess stand with Diana, but there are NO prices on the pizzas, the menus which you have to ask for and can look through at the table also have NO prices.   Sooooo it required us to continually ask and walk up to the counter to the hostess/waitress stand to look up a price/size that we were interested in.  Keep in mind we had never been here before, so we had no idea on prices or sizes of pizzas.  Thus a lot of questions.  Additionally, EVERYONE has to order at the counter (hostess stand) so lines form and people get annoyed, but shit there is no other way of getting pricing and descriptions of pizzas.  How about you hire some waitress' to service tables?    Basically, the beer prices are great, the total setup with the new owners is sub-par and the ONE waitress/hostess trying to service everyone is just dumb.    Steer clear til they figure it out!"}
{"text":"So this place gets four stars because the staff has been great, the drinks are cheap, and the pizza and wings are exactly what you'd expect.  I bought about 4 rounds of drinks and food for 6 people and dropped maybe $60-70 max.  The place is usually pretty relaxed, and the bar staff are quick to help you and they make a nice strong drink as soon as they recognize you (or you tip them well, like at most places).  The food does leave a lot to be desired, but you're making a mistake if you're going to Dahmen's for a nice sit down dinner.  Dahmen's is a fun little bar that just so happens to serve pizza and good breadsticks."}
{"text":"Tucked in a strip mall behind the bright sign of Qdoba, sits this hidden gem. The place screams local tavern and has a pizza menu to back it up. The pizza is exactly what you would expect from a local Wisconsin joint such as Dahmen's: Cracker crust, thick red sauce, traditional toppings. There are a multitude of specials throughout the week including a pizza buffet that I'm dying to try. This is a place my husband and I wish we lived closer to so we could walk to it. It's a definite must try for those who love small-town, \"townie\" bars and pizza."}
{"text":"It gets two stars for it's two stars.  1. The ridiculously great bread sticks and sweet cinnamon sticks. I will go back for these again alone if someone wants to go here.  They are light and tasty and could be sold by the dozen.  2. The great staff. We all thought that the lady who was helping us was not only adorably sweet but rocked her shape-ups well.   The pizza isn't anything special. The salad bar leaves much to be desired. I could see the location being a great hang out for a game with the open space and high top tables. It's on the brink of mom & pop meets college bar."}
{"text":"Great pizza and WONDERFUL breadsticks! Good service too. All around good place. We'll be coming back for the White Pizza. :)"}
{"text":"Went here because of a Groupon.  $14 for 14\" five topping, bread sticks, and two pints domestic.  Great deal, great service, but for a pizza place the pizza was very sub par."}
{"text":"The pizza was not good. Thin, floppy, greasy--it reminded me of back when those frozen pizza cookers came out and there were samples everywhere. But the bartender was friendly and my kids loved getting their own drinks. We won't go back, but I would with friends. Enough beer and even the thin, floppy and greasy among us start to look good."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good.  It's not excellent and it's not bad.  The dinner buffet is cheap and it's worth the price.  They'll normally ask if you want something special, so if it's not busy you are pretty much ordering a pizza for yourself and can have as much of it as you want without having to have just the one pizza.  They have a little bar area which is cool, and all of the guys who work behind the bar are really nice and easy to talk to.  The Tap selection is very surprising and has alot of good beers.  It's a good change of pace when you want a nice calm meal.  It would be a great place to take the kids (They also have a games area).  It's fun."}
