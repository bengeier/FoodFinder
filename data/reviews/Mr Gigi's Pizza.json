{"text":"The best pizza in all of New Tecumseth and really great pasta dishes too. Staff is warm and welcoming, it's a family business and that shines though. Make a reservation on weekends and bring cash - no cards accepted."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service.  Really consistent, too.  Call ahead for reservations on the weekend, and it's cash only, which is more than a little ridiculous.  Seriously.  I'd take 1 star off just for making me walk next door to the bank."}
{"text":"Pretty good homemade pizza.

This place needs to get:
- Debit /Credit. This place is CASH ONLY.
- A Website!

Taken out twice, ordering pizza and salad. It's good, but also more expensive then New Orleans Pizza down the street."}
{"text":"***CASH ONLY***

Probably the best pizza in New Tecumseth. The other menu items we've had are good too. Service is friendly and efficient. You never wait too long for your food. My son thinks it is so good that they should open another location called Mrs. Gigi's."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian atmosphere. I have enjoyed the pizza, but usually opt for one of the exquisitely prepared pasta dishes, whether it is from the menu or a daily special. I like to enjoy a bottle of Birra Moretti for a complete experience."}
