{"text":"Really poor quality food all three times we've ordered. First time dim sum was ok but nothing special and not fresh for sure. Second time mixed veggies had cucumber cooked in and fried rice was old and crusty. Third time my finance ended up over the toilet for two days, too sick to go to work. Nothing tastes fresh or of good quality, just cheap sugary sauce and cheap cuts of meat."}
{"text":"Why haven't I done a review for Magic Bowl yet?!
I discovered this place by accident one day when my extended family was visiting. They wanted Dim Sum but didn't want to go all the way to Chinatown to get some...I was skeptical at first but this place definitely has 'hidden gem' quality. 
The owners are a young family from China, the husband went to school for 3 years to learn how to do Dim Sum and says that it is ever evolving...he could go to school for 10 more years and not know everything about Dim Sum dishes. His classmates in China keep him up to date on the Dim Sum trends and he tries new dishes every couple of months. So far my favourite are the pork and mushroom steamed dumplings that look like mushrooms and the sweet yolk piggy buns. Oh, and the har gow are perfection.
All the dim sum items are made every day or every other day so they are super fresh (Taryn doesn't know what she's talking about) I much prefer the dim sum at Magic Bowl over the same old same old at Silver Dragon and we try to visit every Sunday now. 
I remember why I didn't want to do a review...I want to keep this place all for myself!!"}
{"text":"Wow. What a pleasant surprise! Normally we go to Chinatown for Dim Sum but decided to give this place a try. All of their regular Dim Sum dishes are  $5 each with some specialty items being a little more. 
We had all the usual items, dumplings, Sui Mai and sticky rice. Everything was delicious!! The salt and pepper squid was particularly amazing! 
Really good flavor to everything we ordered and the service was fantastic. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Fast, and fresh western style Chinese. A few interesting standouts, a couple of misses, some inconsistencies, and decent dim sum lunch.

Dim sum is cooked to order (not really a large enough place to warrant a cart), and was quite good. Dumplings were soft and nicely stuffed, the pan fried fish and turnip cake had a crispy exterior and soft interior, and the beef short in black bean sauce had me scraping the bowl and thinking about ordering another go-round. House made pork and shrimp spring rolls are nicely spiced with small tender shrimp and loosely packed ground pork.

Take-out suppers, however, haven't quite lived up to the promise of that first eat-in lunch. Some things are done well. Palace style or ss chicken is done with lightly breaded chunks, rather than doughy battered chicken \"balls\". Likewise the ginger beef is beautifully crisp, though somewhat inconsistent with regards to what other veggies accompany the dish (sometimes it's just straight beef, sometimes there's stir fried peppers and carrots, sometimes just carrots). Though as the standing $4.99 special, it's worth the order.

Braised and stir fried veggies have been good, if again inconsistent. Szechuan eggplant has a nice kick, though more vinegar than spice, and the mixed vegetables with garlic comes loaded with garlic (and the last time we specified no corn or water chestnuts, and ended up with some gai lan instead...don't know if that will happen again though).

Fried rice has been consistently disappointing. Everything from basic mushroom to the curry fried rice and the house special has appeared just barely cooked; not a whiff of the mythical 'wok hei' that makes food geeks drool. Likewise the fried noodles. Our last order of satay fried noodles where nicely spicy (as I'd specifically asked) but featured just the mildest hint of peanut or satay flavor.

We've never had anything we'd consider bad from here, just kinda bland. Being as I live pretty close, I can definitely see myself heading back for more dim sum lunch. However, I'll probably keep looking for another take-out supper spot (next up, Bill's or Kam Han, closer to McLeod Trail)."}
{"text":"I came here with one of my closest friends who just happens to be Chinese. Over the last 9 years, we've probably eaten at 80% of all the well known dim sum places in town. He discovered this place about a month ago he told me and was telling me this place has the best dim sum in town and it didn't matter where you lived, it was worth the drive.

Was this true?

Let me start off by saying its not on a main street. Luckily I use to live on this street, so I didn't get lost but I could see some people getting lost haha. Its located in a mini strip mall and when we arrived, it wasn't busy at all at 11:15am; meaning we were the only people in the restaurant - 5 of us mind you. The great thing was, we didn't have to wait in line, it was the first time I was seated in a dim sum restaurant in Calgary that was bustling with many waitresses walking around really fast and the loud clacking sounds of dim sum bowls, plates, tea cups and chop sticks being table super duper fast haha... this was going gearing up to be a zen-like dim sum experience :)

My friend said that the popular dumplings like su-mai and ha-gaw were done amazing; It was true. ugh, it was just so fresh!!! Being the only people in the restaurant and that they had just opened and were not like U&Me who are opened practically all day, expect a little wait for your dim sum. But sit back and relax :) deep inhalde and slow exhale haha enjoy your jasmine tea and your food will come. It was  worth the wait.

We ordered sticky rice (one of my FAVs!), delicious, sticky and fresh. Check!
Cabbage dumplings, delicious, piping hot and fresh, Check!
Waiter, but could have also been the owner, always smiling and not rude, Check!
... yes, follks... customer service at dim sum :) I really appreciated that and was a nice change.

More people eventually entered the restaurant, but the noise level was pretty low. I had great company and great food.

I really liked it. The only thing for me was that its a little far now that I live very central, but if I lived in the south, I'd hit this place up on the weekend GUARANTEED!

Thanks Magic Bowl for a great experience :)"}
{"text":"We've ordered from here a few times over the past year and a half, and have had consistently good food! We love their steamed pork buns and sweet and sour chicken. 

Their menu isn't expensive, and they've got a lesser priced dim sum menu so you can try even more of their great food :)"}
{"text":"Not great. Our food was ok but all of the containers were leaking and overflowing. Our first and last time ordering from there."}
{"text":"Was a little skeptical about this small, out of the way place. Nervous when we arrived that we weren't greeted right away, and there was only one other table with people. 

They totally redeemed themselves. Once they saw we were there, the service was excellent, and the food was OUTSTANDING. It filled up quick too so I think we arrived at just the right time. I think we have found our new go to for dim sum!

Super affordable and great quality."}
{"text":"Small restaurant that packs a punch. It's been almost 15 years since my last Dim Sum. Why? The food was amazing and the server was very friendly. The menu is presented with pictures making it easier to understand what you are ordering. Defiantly a place I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Living in the far Southeast makes it hard to find good dim sum close to home. Another challenge is the fact that my hubby doesn't really love dim sum. In the search to overcome these issues we decided to try out Magic Bowl for lunch today. 

When we arrived there was only one person person working and even though there was only two other tables he was obviously flustered. Luckily someone showed up to help him right after we ordered. Part of the reason we thought this might be a good place to go was that the dim sum is off of the menu and not carts so it was easy to combine some \"western\" options with the dim sum. We ordered:

- House Fried Rice - tasty but nothing out of the ordinary
- Har Gow - Seriously some of the best I have ever had. The balance                 between shrimp and rice wrapping was perfect and the taste was fantastic
- Salt and Pepper Squid - the batter fell off the squid when you bit into it but the taste was good
- Shanghai Noodles - again, tasty but nothing out of the ordinary
- Shu Mai - these we ok. More greasy than I would like but ok
- BBQ Pork Rice Rolls - These were really not good :-( they had frozen mixed vegetables inside with the pork and the wrap was mushy. Disappointing
- Salt and Pepper Tofu - loved it! The tofu was crispy on the outside and with a bit of the salt and pepper mixture on top it was delicious

My husband liked (not loved) the things that he would normally eat except for the rice rolls but none of us liked those. My three year old daughter loved the squid and the Har Gow with the noodles. I think that the bill was about $40 including a tip with enough leftovers for one adult meal.

Overall it was ok. I would definitely try it again but if I wanted to have a great meal of dim sum there are a lot of better options and I would likely stick to my two favourites Ho Won or Happy Hill."}
{"text":"I was thinking since I had to go GF, I would never be able to have Chinese take out again. WOW, I looked on the \"Find Me GF\" app and this place came up not to far from our home. I looked at the Menu and they had a nice selection of GF options. (*see pic). I was really impressed with the husband and wife team who own and run this neighbourhood place. She greeted me with a big friendly smile. They have been nestled in this location for over 10 years, it is cozy with scattered tables, and a take out counter near the front. They also have a to-die-for DIM SUM menu, which my son enjoyed..(Number 1 & 4 are apparently best sellers). I ordered from the GF menu:  Ginger beef: it was spicy, and perfect ratio of sauce and grated carrot, Sweet and Sour Chicken: Breaded in a GF coating and the sauce had veggies/peppers/pineapples. Coconut Rice: Perfect moisture. Chicken Egg Foo Young: I LOVED the gravy/sauce on this, it was folded like a big pancake. Was delicious.  Chicken & Veggies with Rice Noodles: There was ALOT of noodles. I would of liked more veggies, but it was tasty. BBQ Pork - this was on the main appitizer menu, but I asked if they could do GF Soy sauce to make it a GF dish and they did happily. It was a generous amount and I was really pleased!  If you are Gluten Free, this is a great place and I encourage you to check it out and support local owners!!"}
{"text":"We used to go here often (x2/week) for just about everything from soup to dim sum, eat in and take out.  Service is always good, but the food seems to have gone way down hill.  Last time we were there the restaurant was incredibly dirty and food was not nearly what it was!  I have traveled extensively in China and never seen conditions this bad for cleanliness!  But the food was so close to the traditional cuisine!!  The dirt was right from the entrance to the washroom - and sewer gas smell.  I can only imagine the kitchen conditions if they let the restaurant get run down to this degree.  

We will try it again to see if they have smoothed over the rough patch and hope for the best!!!   I hope they redeem themselves!!"}
