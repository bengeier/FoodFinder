{"text":"Came here for lunch. 
Was craving paneer and Biriyani 

The mutton Biriyani was one of the best I ever had. It was perfectly seasoned and I couldn't stop eating it 
The dosa was okay to me but my friend really liked it. I wasn't crazy about the 4 dips that came with it. 
The butter chicken was really good
The Paneer tikka masala wasn't the best for me so I just separated the paneer into the butter chicken sauce. 

Overall, I would come back again.
4 stars because it was overall a good meal"}
{"text":"Came here on family day and my family waited two hours for our food. We asked the server about the status of our food and we would constantly get brushed off with a \"it's coming soon\". Management did nothing about the wait time nor were they apologetic. When the food finally arrived it was average at best, not worth waiting that long for."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food! I gotta say, I'm not always a fan of South Asian restaurants but this one was top notch. The decor was like no other south asian restaurant I have seen. And of course, the service was amazing. Definately a must try!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night, actually just finished having dinner there ! I must say that I was lured here by the good comments, but to be fair I did not read the comments in detail. Now I see the good comments were for their lunch buffet. 

Anyways, One of the dishes I ordered was a chef special dish called Sri Lankan chicken curry. I even asked the server if the dish was good - she obviously replied positively. When the dish in question came out, literally the curry was just with chicken bones. There was no chicken meat in sight, it was just chicken bones curry. I did not complain in the beginning only because our server was busy serving other tables and also I thought of giving a second chance to the dish by digging more into the curry. 

By the end of my meal, I called the server and told her about the dish and showed her the chicken bones. She apologized and said she will do something about it. But when she returned With the bill she said that the owner said that this is how \"Sri Lankan chicken curry\" is supposed to be and that I should have told her earlier if I had problems with the dish. I am not an expert in Sri Lankan dishes, but the restaurant must at least be courteous to name their dish \"Sri Lankan chicken bone curry with chicken wastes\" (coz I also found a chicken neck piece in the curry) so as to not confuse customers like me. 

The dish left a bad taste in my mouth and they charged me 12 dollars for a curry full of chicken bones. It's not about the money for me, but I was shocked that the owners thought it was ok to charge their customers for a dish that consisted only of Chicken wastes. 

End of the story, they did not do anything to help the situation. No apologies from the management nor any explanation apart from the ridiculous one mentioned above. Just a blank stare from the host when I was leaving.

Ps: Note to the owners - remove the sign next to the Sri Lankan chicken curry that says it's a chef signature dish. It will help both, u and ur customers."}
{"text":"This place is okay-ish. The place itself is great. Very spacious and has a lot of parking space as well. It's huge inside and there is a lot of room even if it gets busy. They do have a lunch buffet but it didn't look appetizing enough for us to join it so we ordered off of the menu. The Prices are decent for how much food they give but the appetizers are not worth it though. We got spicy fries for the appetizers which was good but it lacked sauce. Next we got the vegetable biryani which came with a yogurt raitha which tasted really good. It Could have been a little bit More spicer and flavourful but still decent. I liked how the biryani have chunks of soya meat in it. Next we got garlic naan which was really good with the paneer tikka masala which was NOT GOOD. It was so oily! There was no gravy whatsoever it was just filled with OIL! it was not good... but everything else including the excellent was good!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and despite telling ourselves that we weren't going to join the buffet, we were so hungry by the time we got here (it was almost 2), that we decided we were too hungry to order and then wait for food, and we went ahead to the buffet. I was here on a Sunday for a family lunch. The staff was very attentive the minute we walked in the door, despite the weekend lunch rush. It was clean and organized. The wait staff was incredible, which I find is hard to find in a buffet style setting. There was a good variety of food, and even thosai and appam made to order. The thosai comes from the back, you'll have to ask the waiter for it. I would definitely recommend it, if you can handle it! I was so full by the end of it, I couldn't love and wished I lived closer so I could just roll my way home!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice addition to the Scarborough South Asian food scene though it reminded me quite strongly of Southern Aroma (though I wouldn't say it lives up to the quality of that establishment). Really nice, well-decorated space, though it doesn't scream fine-dining. Also, the booths have irritatingly small tables/uncomfortable seats, so you're probably better off with one of their proper tables.

Service is great -- our waitress was incredibly sweet and gave my father a complimentary cheesecake as we were there celebrating his birthday.

The food was excellent! Food was well-timed, with our appetizers coming out relatively quickly. Some of our party found the hot 'n sour soup a little too peppery, but I quite liked the extra kick. The Sri Lankan jumbo shrimp was also tasty.

Our mains were fantastic all-around: we loved the rich Vanni fish curry, and it paired nicely with the veechu roti. The onion dosa was excellent and was accompanied by a delicious trio of chutneys. Chicken hakka noodles were also quite yummy, and not overly oily, which is always nice.

They have a nice selection of desserts, and though I wasn't a fan of their fruity cheesecakes on offer, I had to avail myself of their mango lassi -- a perfect end to a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Food here was amazing. 

Chicken was perfectly cooked. Pakora and chicken 65 best I've had in a while. 

The service was awesome. Dufferin is the man."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place and I can say I'm pretty impressed! 

This restaurant itself is new, they only opened 2 months ago. The place is really clean, which is a huge plus!! The staff are friendly, and come check up on you often. 

When I went, they had the lunch buffet, which was $14.99. They separated the vegetarian, meat and dessert selection. They had a variety of choices to choose from, which was good. I had a few meat dishes, and all of them were pretty good. My favourite was the meat fried rice, chilli chicken and mutton curry. For dessert, I had gulab jamun and some fruits. The gulab jamun tasted good, however the fruits were not ripe enough!! 

All in all, I'll be back and most likely for dinner so I can try out different items from the menu."}
