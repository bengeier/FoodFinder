{"text":"I discovered this restaurant by searching for restaurants near me with grubhub. I ordered a salad, hotbowl, and panini at the same time. All were very good even though I did not eat them immediately. I have been to the physical location several times since, the staff is very friendly and they don't mind any substitutions that you make. I am in love with thier hotbowls. Salads are nice and fresh and the paninis are super. If you have not been I recommend you go check then out tonight!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great Value. Throwing a shout out to Darius, who was extremely kind and helpful. It is rare to find restaurants that truly value great customer service, and Darius definitely embodies this."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in the area. Fresh, delicious and healthy! How can you go wrong...you can't. I've been here several times and have always received top notch friendly service coupled with great food. I order the chicken hot bowl with a spinach base, sichuan sauce (spicy), tomatoes, garbanzo beans, tofu and mushrooms...it's a flavorful power packed combo.

With it getting harder and harder to find healthy choices (especially for those monitoring their diet for training purposes) and solutions I'm grateful Fresh Millions is right around the corner for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I live a few miles from this place and I had never tried it out until yesterday. Waiting so long to try this place out was a huge mistake on my part! The food is delicious and the staff (especially the guy building the bowls last night) was super friendly. Upon my arrival the staff greeted me and explained how the process worked, what was included and what was extra. They have salads, paninis and hot bowls. I opted for the steak bowl with chipotle sauce which was delicious. The bowls include 4 mix-in's that you can choose from a variety of toppings, the staff is great about recommending things to you. There are some premium mix-in's that you have to pay for (which is normal at a lot of places) which include avocado, egg, brussel sprouts, and a few other things. I added avocado and fried egg to my bowl. My bowl came out to about $10.50 + tax which isn't cheap but I felt the food quality made it worth it. I have nothing but positive things to say about this place, the food tasted great, the service was super friendly. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just ate at this place.  Absolutely love how fresh the food is and how clean the establishment is as well. I ate the chicken mandarin salad.  So very good.  I also liked the ability to add additional salad ingredients as well.  The size of the salad was very generous; a full meal.  I will definitely come back to this place when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"After eating junk food on interstate 10 this was a welcomed change. Make your own salad. Fresh. Tasty. Fair price."}
{"text":"This is likely the go-to for a quick and healthy meal. The staff is amazing and very friendly. The concept is different, but the staff is very warm as you enter through the doors. They are very willing to talk you through your options and even make recommendations. I have to say it has sometimes replaced Chipotle and In 'n Out. It's just as fast, and it's great knowing I'm supporting a local business in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst customer service and care I have ever had. The food is nothing to get excited about either."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Fresh Millions. I was greeted by the friendly staff. The place was very clean. 

I went with the chicken hot bowl on brown rice. My sauce was teriyaki and the 4 fresh cut items I had as mix ins were broccoli, mushrooms, carrots and cabbage. All the mix in selections looked fresh cut. About 5 minutes later they brought it out to my table, piping hot and delicious. 

With 10 sauces and so many mix ins for the bowls, Paninis, wraps and salads, I'll be going back again."}
{"text":"didn't have a great experience at this place. Their panini has so much of bread and so little of other stuff. The bread they use for making paninis is pretty thick and makes u feel bloated afterwards. Their bowls were also nothing worth writing home about. I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"I walked in not knowing exactly what I was getting for $8 deal that I purchased. I was greeted with a warm smile and I proceeded by asking the person at the counter about the deal. He was very familiar with it which put me as easy. I explained to him how it's my first time eating there and he was very happy to show me the ordering process. I was given a hot bowl and a bag of chips with a large drink. But then, he added that I needed to add more items for the deal so I got a large cookie and he mentioned another bag of chips. I was very surprised how tasty everything was. Most surprisingly, I forgot to take the other bag with me so he reminded him. This was one of the best experience I have had so far when he comes with deals."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go to this place. However, when I came, the food was a little overpriced, i would say, for the amount they give you. Quality is good for 4 stars, but the portion was small. So I would say 3 star is Fair."}
{"text":"This is a must try restaurant!!! The owner is a very nice man who brought the restaurant  from the Bay Area. I was about to go to subway for a semi healthy meal when this place caught my eye. I decided to give it a try. The owner was very helpful with the recommendations. I decided to get the tiki masala with brown rice, chicken, onions, avocado, jalapeños, and bell peppers. The portions are huge so I will have enough for dinner tonight. I highly recommend this establishment and will be visiting here when I want a healthy hot meal that I don't have to make :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. The staff is incredibly polite and helpful. The food is AMAZING. So fresh and full of awesome flavor. We really enjoyed our lunch and will be back tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendliest staff! Very refreshing for the area, will come time and time again."}
{"text":"Good food.  The menu gives you an abundant array of choices to add to your order.  For example, I got a chicken salad wrap with add in's of my choice and dressing of my choice.  The staff was pleasant.  The place was clean, yet furnished simply.  I prefer more upscale styles, but for a quick run for lunch, this place was adequate.  The music playing was a little muffled and garbled.  Could have been a better choice for a dining experience."}
{"text":"This place has a nice selection! I've had the alfredo with noodles and the green curry with rice. Both sauces seemed a little watered down and diluted, but I supposed this may be the reason as to why it is \"healthier\". The bowls still had a lot of flavor, the green curry has a surprising kick to it. Very tasty and reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that healthy restaurants like these are opening up making it possible for people to have nutritious fast food options! I tried this place using the coupon deal and loved the experience! Very quick and easy, you just pick all the things you want in your meal and they have so many delicious veggies to choose from! Made fresh to order and it was delicious! I got noodles with a ton of veggies and the portions are perfect."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Their veggie noodle bowl is amazing and they are on most of the food delivery sites. Every time I've had them delivered, the order has been perfect and the food still hot."}
{"text":"The place is new... I'd have to say salads above all else. The service was amazing, that alone will make me go back when I'm in the mood for something light and quick. Price is fair for what you get in the meal. If the item as a \"mix in\" that just means toppings like a pizza. Everything is made fresh in front of you. And they even got some really big cookies to pick from. Yum Yum go check them out off Chandler and Kyrene NW corner."}
{"text":"First time here...Really liked the food and very courteous staff..took the time to explain the menu ...portions were bigger than I expected"}
{"text":"Delicious hot bowl! I had the chicken bowl with Thai peanut sauce. I also ordered a Chicken Cobb salad. The food tasted great. Service was excellent as was everything else. This is a must eat location, especially if you're trying to eat fresh! My buddy pored red a panini and it was huge! Portions here are plentiful so be prepared to leave stuffed."}
{"text":"Hot bowls with your choice of meat, salads, and panini's are just a few things on their menu. 
 
I have been here twice now and purchased a chicken hot bowl both times. Essentially the hot bowl is stir-fry with your choice of meat, noodles or rice, sauce (try the Sweet and Spicy! very flavorful) and up to 4 veggies mixed in. The size is generous for the price. The employees are so friendly too!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened up I had to check it out. It was super clean. the food is fresh, and always looks good. they do have some excellent Panini's. I go here several  times a week."}
{"text":"I was skeptical coming here for the first time since it was next to Subway-in a random strip mall but we got the yelp-on (groupon for yelp? idk) but I wanted to try this place trying to claim its freshness. 
I was pleasantly surprised!!! I go pretty frequently now during the lunch time rush. It's always busy but they get everyone in and out very quickly. Everything is very fresh and clean! 
Everyone working there is super friendly and they may or may not know me by name and order now. 
I get the chicken wrap with double black beans(choice of 2 mix ins), mixed greens(choice of green), add avocado (extra $$, but we know that) and southwestern dressing(choice of dressing). But I have tried the hot bowls, salads and paninis and are all delightful!
It's very filling but if you are extra hungry, you can get a side salad for ~$2 dollars extra with your meal!"}
{"text":"Love the tofu bowl with peanut sauce and rice. Also got a noodle bowl with Szechuan sauce. Delicious."}
{"text":"Went today for first time,we were greeted by staff and walked through the ordering process.  I got a hot bowl and it was delicious.  I will definitely go there again"}
{"text":"A friend came by randomly to hang out, so we decided to try Fresh Millions as a lunch place.  Current grand opening is $6 for hot bowls.

(lunch) I got hot bowl chicken, noodles (yellow egg noodles), teriyaki, and toppings of baby corn, bean sprouts, carrots, tofu, and added broccoli (extra $0.50, not bad for portion added!)

(lunch) My friend got hot bowl shrimp, pasta (rotini), and I think it was a southwest kind of sauce (slightly spicy), with toppings.

I tried some of my friends dish and likewise, and we both liked mine better.  The teriyaki sauce was not too heavy and good, but not as good as some other teriyaki sauces I've tried.  The tofu tasted a bit bitter, and the baby corn was a bit off, so they might've benefited from being fresher (to not effect the overall taste).

Food came out quickly and good portions."}
{"text":"Wow, awesome place.  Another example of Yelp reviews not letting me down!  
I had a shrimp noodle green curry bowl and it was awesome.  I'll definitely come back when in the area next."}
{"text":"New place by my office, the food is fresh and great. Servings size are filling and the prices are  affordable."}
{"text":"I went there in my 2nd time one month ago. The meal was so cold. Well, I ordered the \"Hot Bowl\" but not \"Cold Bowl\". So disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. Really good tofu and chicken bowls. Also the yelp checkin Bogo is pretty cool."}
{"text":"It's like a Ghengis Grill meets Subway. the food was surprisingly good! I'll definitely be back to try some more combinations."}
{"text":"Omg this definitely a place for Asian to American dishes . I am a person who loves spicy food omg what can I say about the szechuan it's the best I have ever had thus far. I like the fact that you can put your own toppings on there bowls. They also have sandwiches also. There is such a great variety. The place is such a great and warm environment.  You can get it to go or you can eat there in the dining area. The prices are very reasonable I definitely will eat here again ... so enjoy my hats off to this eatery...."}
{"text":"I had the chicken cobb salad which as very fresh and certainly plentiful. The biggest turn-off for me was when my lunch companion asked to sample a dressing from a salad she had not ordered but was interested and was denied. The woman behind the counter told her it comes on a different salad. My friend stated that she understood that but wanted to try just a small sample for future reference. She was denied again which is why although I work within 2 miles of this place I will never eat there again. Chances are there will be another restaurant type business in this location soon anyways so I will give that one a try when the time comes.
Salads are a dime a dozen so this place did nothing to set itself apart other than horrible service."}
{"text":"Tasty food, good variety, friendly staff, and quick service. Some of the veggies were slightly undercooked (broccoli and onions), but no big deal. Also, the tables are a bit too close together, not enough room for the tables behind either of us to be used. But still, I'd go there again to try more food."}
{"text":"We love this place! My family and I are always looking for fresh, healthier options and are so lucky that Fresh Millions is right down the street from us.  With the options of Alfredo, pesto and curry sauces in addition to all the tasty Asian options ...it goes above and beyond - even our pickier kiddos are happy!  The restaurant is very clean...they are doing an awesome job of keeping up with it.  There are also sandwich options if that is your thing and some great salads.

The only thing that I would suggest they change is they do not have plastic knives. Strange!  It makes it difficult to cut up noodles for the kids or the large (yay!) shrimp they include.  Even if you have to ask for a knife, one should always be available.  I ended up using 2 forks to slice up the noodles but had to bite off the shrimp.

Last note - I'm surprised by some of the reviews that say the portion sizes are small because I thought they are spot on for both the adult and kid options.  If you are looking to gorge yourself on super sized options you can get McDonald's across the street.  The adult entree sizes are at least 16 oz of food which should be enough for any adult.

Try this place out! They have a $6 bowl option right now for their Grand Opening that is an awesome deal if you don't want to spend too much checking out a new place."}
{"text":"Really really good. The bread used on the Panini sandwich was exceptional. My friend and I both got Paninis. We split a chicken tikka masala and a chicken avocado. Both fresh and delish. We did not buy the $20 deal for $8. Want to support small businesses so I wanted them to have my money. Wish they had soup though. Place was clean and friendly staff."}
{"text":"As far as taste goes it was okay but calling this place healthy is a stretch. I wouldn't go back and if you want a hot bowl do yourself a favor and go to YC's instead."}
{"text":"The concept of this restaurant is good. The shrimp is deveined and fresh.  The selection of vegetables can include more Asian and Middle Eastern varieties. The sesame soy and chili sauce is too salty.  I had to toss the rest of the hot bowl because it's so salty, hence the 2 stars.  This is a fast food joint rather than a waitered restaurant."}
{"text":"Yup...this place is AWESOME. The hot bowls are literally SO good. The toppings were really fresh and the noodles were really good themselves. They actually had texture...unlike a lot of \"fast serve\" noodle restaurants where the noodles are like melting rubber in your mouth. The bowls are great portion sizes and there are several different types of bases (rice, noodles, etc, etc) and a huge selection of sauces to choose from....let alone all of the mix-ins you get to choose. Friendly staff, fast service, GREAT FOOD....overall highly recommended. Oh ya, it doesn't hurt that the restaurant is super clean and the staff goes through great lengths to keep everything sanitary...I asked for a packet of soy sauce and the guy washed his hands with soap and water just to hand me a little soy sauce packet. If that isnt \"A\" quality, I don't know what is!"}
{"text":"Place is very clean food is fresh and tasty. I used the Yelp discount and they actually made another salad for me to take out, very nice people behind counter."}
{"text":"I love this place!
How did it take until 2014 for this to happen??
Everythings right about Fresh Millions Restaurant...
...and as restaurants go, that just almost never happens."}
{"text":"I came here today for my first time for a quick to go lunch. The hot bowls are the way to go! The panini sandwiches also look good and I may try that the next time I stop in. 

I had a tofu bowl with a base of half spinach and half noodles. My sauce was sweet and spicy with add ins of zucchini, red bell peppers, mushrooms and carrots. I thought the balance of all ingredients was very good, just enough of everything and a great taste. The tofu was not fried which I appreciate and it was not overly saucy. The vegetables were cooked to the right tenderness too! 

Overall I would suggest this as a quick and relatively healthy lunch spot great for vegetarians and meat eaters alike."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and fresh, the portions are great for the price, and the customer service is awesome. I stop by here almost every time I'm on my way through Phoenix. There really are an insane number of combinations you can make. The only downside is that you will be torn between the one favorite you found that blows you away or a totally new mix that might be your new favorite. Eat here!"}
{"text":"Very friendly atmosphere and people.....awesome fresh and healthy variety for all ages....delicious and something for everyone...a MUST try new restaurant....."}
{"text":"Stove closed for cleaning 20 mins before closing time. :-(  maybe sooner; that's when I arrived.   ,; ("}
{"text":"The food here is fresh and delicious. The sauces aren't too heavy or salty and the service is quick. Great place to grab a quick lunch or after gym fuel!!"}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced, with lots of healthy options. I had the Szechuan sauce with noodles and lots of vegetables and chicken and had to get it to go cuz I couldn't eat it all. 
They have a fundraising program which I will likely use for our nonprofit group, as well."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. Salad was weak, they let me add just two veggies and had 4 total shrimp. Very disappointed. It didn't taste bad, but for $9 you can get a MUCH better salad anywhere else."}
{"text":"First time visitor, used the Yelp coupon. Hot bowls are delicious. Staff was very friendly. And there's a lot of options to explore next time we come"}
{"text":"My wife and I had never heard of Fresh Millions before looking for local options on Yelp. The menu is geared towards someone looking for healthy fresh food that doesn't take a long time. It didn't take long to get our food and the bread for the panini's were perfect. They even made my baby a small bowl of noodles and veggies for her to eat. I was very surprised about how delicious and how fresh everything was, also customer service was tip top. Will be back 100% sure."}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better service! We were interested in tasting sauces and they brought them out on a plate with spoons for us. It was fast and very easy. Would highly recommend going here and I will be making another trip shortly."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and excellent service. What more can you ask for? Everything from the hot bowls to panini sandwiches, there isn't a bad meal here. Fresh Millions is a new favorite."}
{"text":"Wow. Its like a healthy mongolian bbq with latin and italian options as well as asian. I ordered the sesame soy chile sauce on a chicken hot bowl over brown rice and it tasted amazing. No need for salt like some reviewers stated.  Portion size was plenty big enough. For 2 hot bowls, 2 fountain drinks, and a side salad was just over $20. Tomorrow im going back to try the pesto. Will update if im dissapointed. I wish this chain had a location in northern cali, id go all the time!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Healthy and fast. It's next to subway. I got tired of eating subway all the time so I decided to give this place a try. The staff is very friendly and it was fast from order to checkout."}
{"text":"Really nice owner. They have a good selection of panini's. Quick service. Seems family owned. Will come back again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. As soon as I walk in I can't help but notice all the equipment is brand new. Even the grills, yes they have grills which means they cook their meats fresh! I had the Thai peanut panini which was delicious.  The sauce had a tad spicyness which was awesome. The cold table was perfectly stocked everything looked very fresh. The gentlemen that helped me has been with the company for over 10 years so he knew his stuff which I liked. I will definitely be coming back as I miss sandellas a lot."}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times, and each time I have tried something different: salad, southwest wrap, and Thai curry hot bowl with brown rice. The food is indeed prepared fresh and made to order. You can create your own meal from a variety of add-ins--protein, veggies, sauces, dressing, cheeses, etc--or select a signature combination. Kind of like Coldstone Creamery, but healthier. :-) The food was excellent each time I visited. Dining area was a bit austere, but clean. Service was friendly and prompt. Prices seemed reasonable. I'd recommend this to someone looking for a step up from Subway, with the same convenience and customization factor."}
{"text":"Great place for quick FRESH food. The owner is very gracious and really knows how to take care of his customers. Try the chicken and grains salad or the steak and rice bowl with a generous portion on Sriracha sauce."}
{"text":"Love this place! Makes eating healthy taste good! My only reason for holding back on that 5th star is the price. Expect spending about $10 per person... not including a drink."}
{"text":"The food is great, and the staff were extremely courteous.  I can honestly state that I've never been in a cleaner or more well kept restaurant.  I definitely recommend giving it a try.  One note - the owners of the chain may want to invest in some better photography, decor, design, etc.  There is nothing appealing about any of it - nothing to draw you in.  And unfortunately the name too doesn't really tell you much about the place.  \"Fresh Choice\", \"Fresh n' Fast\", \"Greens & Grains\" - literally anything that you can come up with on that basic theme would be a better name.  Regardless I will go back, and the suggestions I'm making are only to make it more appealing to a wider audience."}
{"text":"The Panini's are fantastic. Panini's usually have hard thin slices of bread, not the case here.  The bread is thick and fluffy, it's delicious. I could probably eat the bread by itself."}
{"text":"Really great food and service. Delivery was even early! Love the concept-did not disappoint. Will be ordering from here again :)"}
{"text":"First time eating here. Love the idea of having so many options to choose from, even though that scared me away initially. I had the steak hot bowl w/noodles, soy chilli sauce and veggies, flavorful and the noodles were good. Big portion sizes. BF had the chicken avocado panini, gave it 4stars due to the bread and chicken."}
{"text":"I just used a groupon I purchased for the new Gilbert location. I ordered a grilled chicken and avocado panini, my husband the chicken philly panini. The contents of the sandwich are completely dwarfed by the slabs of (slightly grilled, not warm) bread. In the whole of my sandwich were five chunks (yes chunks) of tomatoes, a thin slice of chicken and more chunks of avocado. Instead of filling up on the proteins and veggies you get ten times the amount of carbs you'd ever need in a day. I'm super disappointed as I live close and like supporting more local establishments. I will not return and not recommend."}
{"text":"Friendly service from the beginning of the order to leaving out the door!
Helpful service on choosing how to order.
Exceptionally clean!
Flavors were delicious and not overwhelming 
We probably have found out new place to get noodles locally  will be back!"}
{"text":"I was looking to grab a healthy meal and found the website for this place.  Called ahead to try to place a pick-up order and there was no answer.  However the website said they were open on Sundays and there were recent reviews so I assumed the phone number was incorrect or they were too busy to answer.   When we arrived we saw a sign on the door saying \"New hours, closed on Sundays.  Sorry for any inconvenience. \"  You know what would have been less inconvenient?  Taking the time to update your website with correct store hours.  And having an answering machine with said hours."}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times and every time it's been good.

I usually get their Chicken Hot Bowl, with the Thai Green Curry (not too spicy but a nice little kick).  I get the 50/50 base of noodles and brown rice and a mix of veggies.  It's really good.  

The place is clean and veggies look very fresh.  I would recommend this place as a healthier choice for lunch, its not so heavy that you feel like sleeping when you get back to your desk but filling enough that your not looking for a snack shortly after either."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Bowls are great, salads are great, super friendly people. Food is all very fresh. Great for kids - they can pick their own vegetables."}
{"text":"This place was better than I had anticipated. There are so many ways to order the many dishes. Fresh and almost a million ways to order dishes=Fresh Millions Restaurant!"}
{"text":"The staff were friendly and helpful to suggesting the sauce for my hot bowl. The ordering system was pretty straight forward and easy to follow. I ordered the steak with spinach base, sweet and spicy sauce, and you also get to choose 4 types of veggies to mix in. The ingredients taste very fresh. I'm personally a salad/veggie person and enjoy some meat to go along with the dish. I absolutely love this concept!"}
{"text":"I was not really impressed with the food. I ordered a panini. When I got it, it was 2 large pieces of bread and the chicken and so on in between. It just looked like a sandwich! It was never pressed in a panini press. The chicken was thick as well, and a bit tough. Not really sure if I will return."}
{"text":"Went for the first time for lunch with my kids. Prices are super reasonable. Who else has kids' meals for $4 and it's real food?! 

My daughter ordered a hot bowl with chicken teriyaki. She loved that she got to choose her two veggie mix-ins. My son ordered a grill cheese with chicken. Looked like a ton of bread to me, but he enjoyed it. I ordered the hot bowl with spicy chicken with four veggie mix ins. It was huge! Such a great value. I took it home and ate the second half for lunch the next day. 

Raj, the manager is super friendly and his staff was also friendly. The place is clean
And service was quick. We will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy creating my own hot bowls here. The ingredients are super fresh and I love the variety of options."}
{"text":"What this place lacks in atmosphere it more than makes up for in the food
I had the bacon bowl with noodles with  schezuan sauce it was packed with yummy flavor. The staff was helpful  and friendly 
They were also donating 50% of the nights receipts to the Wild Mustang Rescue Ranch
Very cool
I recommend this place"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. You can created your own bowl, or get a salad or panini. 

I had the chicken tikka masala panini. The tikka masala was yummy, but I didn't care for the bread. It was soft and tasted like plain white bread. Next time I will definitely try it in a bowl. 
My daughter made her own bowl with rice, chicken, veggies and teriyaki sauce. It was very good. 

I'm not sure why people say the portion sizes are too small, I think they are a perfect size. 

The restaurant itself was clean and the staff was nice."}
{"text":"Wonderful and healthy alternative! The customer service is fantastic and the restaurant itself is on point with all fresh ingredients beautifully displayed."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. I come in quite a bit and have come to know the staff, they are great people and their number one priority is to serve you quality food quickly. On top of serving quality food they're restaurant is one of the cleanest in chandler if you don't believe me just go take a look at neighboring restaurants in that complex. Overall I would recommend this to anyone they literally have millions of options and if you can't find something there you like go to McDonald's because that's all you're good for."}
{"text":"Agreed, this place is awesome. Panini's were f-ing tasty! Very clean and very fresh (in terms of food). Definitely coming back next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch first time today with a Groupon.  Very clean and nice, fast and friendly service.  Two of us shared a chicken tikka masala panini and were glad we did because it was plenty for two with a drink and chips.  Very fresh and delicious.  It's a small space (reminded me of a Subway in terms of size) but at least half the people were coming in for take-out so there were no issues with tables."}
{"text":"This restaurant is extremely clean which is very appealing upon walking in. The customer service was exceptional! They answered every question that I had very politely and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Very delicious and great selection of fresh ingredients! I had the chicken hot bowl with pasta and thai peanut sauce - Delish! But Next time I'll add in spinach. 

Very helpful staff and quick prep.  Definiely will come back :)"}
{"text":"My mouth is soooo happy!  Chicken hot bowl with brown rice and spinach, scallions, almonds, mushrooms and water chestnuts AND Tikki Masala sauce. Oh yum!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! It's just the place you need on a cold day when you are a lil extra hungry! Fast service, hot food and spicy sauces! I chose Szechuan sauce on a tofu noodle bowl. Yum!"}
{"text":"All of the ingredients are fresh. 
My first time here because of a Groupon and I am amazed at how fresh looking everything is.
The restaurant is clean, it has the same concept as \"subway/chipotle\". But more of a fresher and variety of choices to choose from."}
{"text":"Great costumer service, and the food is so fresh and big portions, 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch. Lots of choices. Fresh ingredients woked to order. Generous portions. Friendly and helpful staff. Will definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty good. The shezchuan is spicy which is why I like it. If you like spicy I recommend that!"}
{"text":"A rep ordered from here for my office staff and while it was a confusing process to order, what was received was amazing. I got the chicken hot bowl with half rice and half noodles. I only got noodles, but i was fine with that because it was super yummy. I probably wouldn't have liked the rice. I got the teriyaki sauce and it was very tasty. The add ins I got were carrots, broccoli, scallions and avocado. I can't wait to order again. Maybe if I actually went into the restaurant it would have been easier to order."}
{"text":"What a great place for some healthy choices and variety of toppings. Whether it be a bowl made with noodles, rice, salad, you are able to choose up to 4 toppings to add to your \"creation.\" As its namesake implies, there's a multitude of ways to create a different type of \"creation\" and each time you come in and I plan on trying many of them. 
The prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly as well!!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. The salads are large, fresh and delicious. The variety is almost overwhelming. The salad dressings are also very good. 
Everything is made to order in front of you. We enjoyed the salad with mixed greens, mandarin oranges, sunflower seeds and chicken. Yum!"}
{"text":"Hot bowl!! Chicken, noodles and Thai Peanut sauce. Oh man! Good stuff. The restaurant is small and most of it is taken up by the make table where they are loaded up with fresh ingredients. Gluten free options are clearly marked in the menu which makes it so easy especially when there are variety of sauces to choose from. The service was extremely friendly and courteous and the food was served hot. I will definitely be back. I had it two days ago and I am still thinking about it. Always the sign of a new 'go to' place!"}
{"text":"This place has fresh ingredients and looks very clean. The lady helping me was nice. However I just opened my wrap, that costs 9 bucks and they didn't put the chicken in. I'm upset because I can't go back since I'm working. It's just veggies and I love meat."}
{"text":"Healthy, tastes great and good value.
I bought the $20 for $8 deal and we (family of 3) ate til we were full and it only cost us an additional $1.50! It had lots of veggies to choose from. They cook the bowls with your toppings selection.
It's very clean too! :)
Whenever I'm back in the area we will def return."}
{"text":"It's quite awesome.   I get delivery from here when I'm tired of regular Chinese options.   This food is probably better for you,  but you'd never know it!  It's awesome."}
{"text":"Servings are comparatively small to like restaurants and for the price . But the food tastes delicious and semi makes up for the prices!"}
{"text":"Fresh is the word here and all for a great price. I love the options and simple approach too. My only small wish is for the chicken to have more flavor and not come in cubes like you would find in processed meats. Since we had a coupon we had a few dollars left over and chose a cookie, which was not tasty and hard. But we came for the fresh salads and return often."}
{"text":"Fast, healthy, and fresh! Good sized portions with so many options. I will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Quick fresh tasty filling food. Had the chicken bowl with tikka masala sauce on noodles. Recommend."}
{"text":"Good variety for vegetarians!!! Had the panini and the hot bowl!! Loved them..hope they can keep up the cleanliness... Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Cool spot in central location! Although the grand opening signs are up, this eatery has been up for almost a year. Trendy, build-your-own bowl concept with a base of rice or noodles. 4 veggies or other mix-in included - which was great! I was impressed by the cleanliness of the shop & portion size of the bowl. Staff was helpful!"}
{"text":"The Chicken Tikka Masala panini is delicious! It has a lovely curry sauce, red peppers and onions with plenty of gooey cheese. My husband ordered a bacon bowl with teriyaki sauce and brown rice, also very good. The bacon was nice and crispy and the veggies were cooked nicely. We will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly staff, fresh and healthy food while being reasonably priced. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Grove Location. I've always like Fresh Millions because it has this \"Clean Eating\" choice vibe that reminds me of Chipotle-type restaurants. All of the staff was friendly and my server was nice enough to give suggestions on good food combos. Prices are very reasonable and the hot bowls are delicious. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Clean, yes. Variety, yes. Fresh, umm, No. I had a salad and the chicken was who knows how old and the corn was canned. Even after I inquired about the corn, she told me that \"the can had been opened today.\" Oye! It is scary what they call \"fresh\" and it makes me wonder about the rest of what they serve. The Fuze Tea, well, it was tasteless and probably just carmel coloring. We won't be back. Sorry."}
{"text":"Great quality HEALTHY food and at an affordable price. Service was also spot on. Great place for families too- took our 3.5 year old and he enjoyed their kiddie pasta bowl. Employees there were so nice to our wild child. We will be back!! We've had their bowls before- Delish! Salads are also amazing! Love having options like them!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Been going there for lunch every single day and it's always fresh and tasty. They make my food super quick and employees there are always so friendly. It's a nice, clean place to eat. Would defiantly recommend!"}
{"text":"First visit here.  Got the veggie panini today.  DELISH!!  I'll be back to try other menu items!!"}
{"text":"Great food to go along with Great service . Fresh salads and wraps made when you order . Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes freshly satisfying food"}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience, I went for a paninni, the chicken was raw and the woman  gives a bad service, and the person who prepared the paninni did not use gloves to prepare the paninni, I do not recommend this place and I would not come back"}
{"text":"My wife and I really like Fresh Millions. It's a cool set up where you get to pick a \"base\" - rice, noodles, spinach, etc - meat, and toppings. You get quite a bit of food for what you pay for, definitely filled up the two of us up and we came hungry. We each got a bowl with a couple extra toppings - it comes with 4 and any extra is an additional $.50 which can add up if you're not careful - plus the side salad, which had a really good balsamic vinaigrette. Overall it was really good and if you go there you might as well use the yelp coupon of 60% off, because I am sure this won't be up there for long as it's such a good deal. Almost forgot, the biggest surprise was how good the sauces were, I got the Curry and wife got the sweet and spicy. Mine had the perfect sauce to food ratio but my wife's was too soupy, which is why the 4 stars. Overall a great place to go and we'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today and I had the chicken salad wrap and it was delicious! Everything is mixed fresh before your eyes. Friendly service. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time trying Fresh Millions --- it was delicious, fresh and perfect portion for the price. We will definitely be returning customers."}
{"text":"Very clean and good. This is my first time and I got 2 salads. I was thinking the little scoops they used might not be enough toppings but once all mixed up it was perfect. I did the chicken Cobb and southwest. My only complaint was I wish the lettuce and tomatoes were chopped a little smaller. I had some huge pieces of romaine. I look forward to coming back to try their hot bowls. They looked good!"}
{"text":"So amazing! They have vegan options and everything was SO FRESH, like the name. It was good! Will definitely be back to try more options! All the veggies are laid out in front of you, and they look very clean and inviting. You just feel good after you finish your meal."}
{"text":"Since Fresh Millions opened up, we've tried it out a few times. They have multiple menu options such as rice bowls, salads, paninis, and wraps.

The first couple of times we went, I was pretty impressed with Hot Bowls. They offer a few different protein choices for these bowls including chicken, steak, shrimp, bacon, eggs, & tofu with a few sauce options ranging from teriyaki, sweet & spicy, alfredo, chipotle, & more. Your choices are served with veggie mix-ins on the base of your choice of noodles, rice, pasta, spinach, or romaine.

I've tried out the Chicken Hot Bowl with the Szechuan sauce, Teriyaki Sauce, & Tikka Masala sauce + veggies & either rice or noodles. My only qualm is that they're a little inconsistent. Once I had a bowl with the perfect amount of sauce & the veggies were cooked perfectly, but the other times there was way too much sauce & the veggies were not cooked for enough time.

I haven't tried out the other options here, but my fiancé ordered a panini sandwich a couple of times. Neither of them were anything to write home about but still okay. I'd say that if you're looking for a quick option then this place is okay, I probably wouldn't put it on my list of places to go back anytime soon, however."}
{"text":"Loved all the salad combos.  Also enjoyed the rice bowls. My husband and I went service was quick and accurate despite a couple tweeks to the order.  Everything was fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"My hot bowl was great but my wife's Caesar salad was so-so. Price and Service was great."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome. Everyone is super friendly. The owner is really nice. The restaurant is always clean. The food is delicious, consistent, & healthy! You can't go wrong with a hot bowl, panini, or a salad (they are huge!)"}
{"text":"Five stars for one of the few healthy, fast casual options in the valley. Their portions are generous and the veggies are truly fresh. I usually get the steak bowl with szechuan sauce because I like spicy. I tried the chop salad yesterday and the portion was so large I ended up saving half for the next day."}
{"text":"The food is decent. Flavor is good. A tad salty on some of the sauces. The veggies are fresh but portion sizes are SMALL. For a place that offers a more limited version of what YC's does, they need to draw the people in with bigger portions before they scale back, once they have a good customer base.  

I love the veggie options for being vegetarian but chipotle offers a better deal for the value."}
{"text":"Went in for my first time and loved it. I had the tofu hot bowl and the lady who helped me out was really nice and patient with me. I will definitely be coming back. My order was freshly made in about 5mins."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers for another great recommendation! This might be my longest review I've ever written...

First I have to say... I hope the owners read this review. The gentleman that worked this evening named Alex was the best. He was so courteous, extremely helpful and everything an employee in a restaurant should be. So THANK YOU and keep Alex around... You will have repeat customers coming in with his great service.

Ambience: We walked in and it was dead (8pm). Almost thought it was closed. Alex was mopping and immediately stopped once we came in which I thought was kind of him to do. We walked up to the fresh food assembly line and he made it a point to ask me to hold on a moment so he can wash his hands. The sink is right in view. My OCD self was so relieved when he did that. This. Place. Is. CLEAN. And orderly. I was thinking that other restaurants need to take some pointers from these guys. I could probably eat off the counters and not have any issue. I would never do that but ya know what I mean. And based on the other reviews, I didn't just catch them on a good day, this is how it always is and seeing this solidified the other Yelpers reviews.

Food: I am not very adventurous of an eater so I was a little apprehensive trying a new menu. Alex walked me through it all even let me sample the sauces. I didn't feel rushed or that I was a bother, it was a great experience and made me happy for choosing to eat here tonight.

I ordered the chicken hot bowl with half noodles half rice with shredded carrots, mushrooms, bean sprouts, and zucchini. Topped with some green onions and their sweet and spicy sauce - not too spicy either! It tasted so good, not greasy or loaded with MSG. It was DELISH. A big serving too so I can have left overs for lunch. I would say that the taste was familiar to me. It was a good mixture between Pei Wei and YCs Mongolian Grill in comparison. The great thing also is that the menu can go a little eccentric if you'd like. I think I'd attempt the Italian sauce next time when I feel like living on the edge... :)

Cost: Not bad - don't forget to use the Yelp deal while it lasts. When that's over, a bowl is under $9 after tax. I would definitely spend $10 here any day. 

In summary, if you're down for a hot noodle bowl with some FRESH veggies and chicken this place is where it's at. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"When you use fresh ingredients you can never go wrong. Today I got a Cesar salad wrap with avocado black beans chives tomatoes and Caesar dressing. Delish"}
{"text":"Had the chicken avocado panini. It was huge and absolutely amazing. Staff is very kind. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today because I have been on a health kick recently. I got the chicken hot bowls and my mom got the buffalo chicken panini. She is one of the most pickiest when it comes to eating, but she loved it. It was refreshing to be able to create the hot bowl yourself with your own mix-ins and sauce. The prices are reasonable and many options to choice from. Also if it is your first time checking in on yelp they offer you a buy one get one option. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a higher rating but they really let us down today.  First the good: the portions are good, the Resturant is tidy, and they had an adequate kids menu.
Problems: they were understaffed by one person so I observed most people moving through the line slowly (the gal making the salads is also taking the payments which constrains the throughput). The guy running the sandwich station flat out forgot to make my panini.  The manager eventually did after he washed his hands and dried them in his shirt (how did you get a food card?).  He did glove up but blew on the gloves to get them open.  My avacado was hard and not ripe and the cheese and sauce were lacking.  As an aside, the chicken was moist, very tender, and all white meat.
Oh, and there was a hair in my wife's salad.
Perhaps we should have stuck to the bowls that the reviewers before me raved about."}
{"text":"(4.75 Stars)
My colleague and I tried Fresh Millions today... She got the Steak Salad and said \"It was good. I ran out of steak before I ran out of lettuce, but that's normal. I would get it again.\" I got the Chopped Chicken Salad, with extra mix-ins, and I still have enough for dinner tonight. It was good! Big chunks of grilled chicken, a number of different mix-ins, multiple lettuce options, and multiple dressing options.
The staff was really nice. The girl who made my salad could tell I had never been in before - and was very patient when I couldn't decide what I wanted. I would definitely come back to try something else. The price was very decent for the size salad I got (2 meals worth) and a drink.
The missing .25 star is because there weren't a variety of soda-size options (I like to get a large at lunch so it lasts me the rest of the day at work) - there was only one size - or soda options (but they had Diet Coke, so I'll be fine).
Maybe next time I'll try one of the giant, yummy-looking cookies they had at the register."}
{"text":"Awesome quick serve concept that's healthy and convenient. Service is excellent and food is delicious. I'll be going here a lot for lunch during work."}
{"text":"Good and fresh. Tastes very good. One time my bowl was waaaaay too salty, but I didn't feel like complaining since it was busy. I like that you can choose between salads, wraps and sandwiches, and hot bowls. A nice healthy alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"Okay, the food is so so. I wouldn't go again unless someone else was paying for the food. The check in offer is not what was given to us. They instead gave us a free kids meal. No where in the offer does it state that it would be switched out. When I brought this up the woman checking us out just shrugged and said that's what they do.  the kids chicken nuggets and mac and cheese were too hot to eat and they didn't have kids cup lids. All in all not a place I'd go back to."}
{"text":"Wife and I went there last night for the first time. WOW!!! I had the teriyaki steak hot bowl with noodles. She has a chicken hot bowl, with a kind of spicy sauce. I can't remember what her flavor was. All I know, we scarfed that food down like it was going to be our last meals. So fresh, so good!!! It's going to be one of our go to places for sure. There are so many combinations, different proteins, bases, flavors, mix-ins, we could go here everyday and have a different meal everyday for a year. Please don't hesitate, this place is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Super fresh food and everyone is so nice. Lots of choices and everything has been good so far. I've been here twice in 3 days! Especially because of the grand opening $6 bowl special."}
{"text":"Wow! A pleasant surprise. I didn't even know this place existed. I met a friend here and we were both impressed. Great food, large portions, friendly helpful staff."}
{"text":"This place has the Healthy meals you are looking ! We found this place in chandler Az but I'm hopping they open one in phoenix soon."}
{"text":"I love the options. I'm vegan and my family isn't, so it can be a chore finding common ground. Fresh Millions is one of our go to spots."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and the co-owner helped us. He was so nice and helpful and made suggestions based on our tastes. We tried the bowl, a panini and side salads. All were so good and made with fresh ingredients! Great flavors in the hot bowl. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As good as it says. Lots of choices, healthy,fresh and flavorful. I can't wait to return"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential. I like the idea and the huge number of flavor possibilities but I don't think it's up to standard yet. I ordered the shrimp bowl with jalapeños, cilantro, carrots, and green onion over white rice. I added on a grilled cheese. The shrimp was over cooked and stringy and the cilantro was not taken off the stem. The Thai peanut sauce over the dish was not well seasoned. The grilled cheese was not melted. I'd order again if there was a bit more quality control."}
{"text":"The place is clean, uncomplicated.

The menu is easy to read. If you have any questions, the staff are helpful. They offer great selection on their menu. Great flavours too!  :)

The price varies, but you can get a healthy, decent, and filling meal for 10.00 and under.

Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Made a great discovery on Yelp and with the BOGO, you can get a free bowl or wrap for dinner as well. Pretty simple concept, but with so many veggie choices it sucks they limit you to four choices. Of course, you can add more stuff, but the price point of $8 (for bowl) works if you stick to the plan. The chicken was nice white meat chunks and I think they wok the stuff in the back although I couldn't see the cooking process. You also have eight or so sauce choices. 
Chipotle Southwest - a good kind of spicy, but very flavorful.
Thai Peanut - this was the one reheated later, but had a faint peanut taste and a bit of a kick too.
Even without the BOGO, still a good place for a healthy meal.(based on your choices)"}
{"text":"Decided to try this today chicken salad wrap was delicious. On the other hand delivery took over an hour and according to my location they are not even a mile from me. Still wasn't disappointed I understand it could've been busy rated it 2 stars because after the wait my steak bowl and shrimp bowl was all mixed up. But definitely recommend the salad wrap."}
{"text":"When all else fails and my husband and I can't decide on something, we pick Fresh Millions. We have been going to the place since it opened and find a new combo we love every time. Download Eat24 if you live nearby and have it delivered to your home or business. Ingredients are fresh, healthy and accommodating to every taste."}
{"text":"Great find!  Super healthy food, *incredibly* reasonable prices (Grand Opening special running right now - $6 for almost anything on the menu!), friendly employees, and quick service.  If you're sick of Subway or are looking for a healthy alternative to fast food, I absolutely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I bought the Yelp deal and thought I'd try it out on a night I didn't feel like cooking. I wasn't expecting much when we walked in, but I was pleasantly surprised. The staff is nice. The food is delicious and fresh. It's a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Ever since the YEE, I've been a fan of Fresh Millions with their millions of ways to eat fresh and healthy hence the name... but I'm more a fan because it's quick, cheap and tasty! 
They have hot bowls, salads, paninis and wraps. The bowls are my go to favorite, with a choice of meat: chicken, steak, sausage, meatball, shrimp or bacon(yes bacon) try it your arteries will thank you..
they offer non-meat options too of just veggies, eggs or tofu 
pick a sauce:  my favorites are the spicy Szechuan, Sweet and Spicy and the Chipotle Southwest(some are GF)too many to name..
pick a base: Noodles, White or Brown Rice, Pasta, Spinach or half and half.
Pick 4 add ins of  fruit and or veggies about 35 choices(extra charge for the avocado, eggs, cheese and artichokes)
My mini me loves the paninis, the bread is amazing & she lets me have a bite but one bite only. Since I've returned the favor and let her have a bite of my bowls, she's hooked and I can't come without her or the owner tells on me. I also have gotten my oldest daughter hooked, who got her hubby hooked(and he's picky) and I took my sister twice while she was in town(she loved it).
Good food, friendly service, a dine in bogo Yelp check in offer and Yelp's cash back(7% money spent deposited back on your linked card) you can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Portion size varies from visit to visit. Once they recognize you as a regular, you seem to get much less food. Paninis are good here."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a late lunch one afternoon. Our group consisted of three adults and three kids. The selection is good and consists of bowls, sandwiches, and salads. Everyone chose bowls and with the various bases (noodles, rice), the fresh vegetable ingredients, the protein choices, and the sauce options, we all ended up with very different but quickly prepared meals. The kids enjoyed choosing the ingredients for their bowls and everyone was happy with the meals. It's a great stop for a fresh, healthy meal - we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great menu. The food here is very fresh, many options for practically any dietary wants and needs including gluten free, dairy free, vegetarian and vegan. 
I had a bowl with spinach base, water chestnuts, bean sprouts, mushrooms, zucchini, shrimp and peanut sauce. Omg! DELISH 
There are so many choices here from salads to hot bowls to wraps. They offer many many veggies to choose from and many proteins and sauces. 
The owner and staff were very willing to accommodate as well as inviting and friendly. 
It's nice to have a place where I can get healthy food for a great value. I can't wait to try another combination of ingredients. 
The atmosphere is somewhat basic, nothing too decorative but clean. I'd say if you're looking for ambiance this may not be the right choice, however, if you're looking for flavor and good food......they have it!"}
{"text":"It was good. There was too much dressing on my wrap, but it was good. I think they were confused by me not wanting lettuce, so they were overcompensating in other areas."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Fresh Millions and I'm pretty impressed. The food is reasonably priced, tastes good and the staff is friendly. Since I checked in on Yelp I received a free meal with my order or had the opportunity to use it later. Today, I ordered the chicken hot bowl with noodles, spinach, zucchini, broccoli, and mushrooms with the soy and chili sauce. It was very good and a perfect level of spicy for me. For dinner, I ordered a grilled chicken salad which looks delightful. Another bonus is that they have gluten free dressings!"}
{"text":"My son and I tried this little place tonight.  The service was excellent, they took the time to explain everything...very friendly.   My son had the shrimp hot bowl, he liked it.  I had the steak panini and it too was good.  I bought the yelp $20 worth of food for only $8."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and love it! The food is fresh, the price is right, and the owner is super nice and accommodating. They also have great gluten free options, which is hard to find at an affordable price point - I personally loved the Thai peanut steak bowl! We will definitely be back and plan on recommending this restaurant to everyone we can."}
{"text":"The options here are spectacular! Basically choose your own base, protein, and veggies which they combine together into a bowl of deliciousness. 

The only detractor is that it's not very comfortable on the inside. It feels like you're supposed to just order and get out as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"Very yummy and fresh! We enjoyed a chicken hot bowl and a panini today.  I love how fresh and delicious my bowl was. My husband was surprised how big the panini was (In a good way!) 
I really liked how I could make my bowl low carb and still full of filling food."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Fresh, tasty and I can eat healthy with no regrets! if you on a diet but are real hungry and need to eat something out, definitely try this place, chicken bowl is great!"}
{"text":"I used GrubHub thru Yelp for my first time trying this restaurant. First of all, the food tastes pretty good, but the price to quantity to quality just isn't there. I ordered a panini, caesar salad and kids nuggets (for $5 you get a kids drink and 6 processed chicken pieces). My entire order was $32.11 (incl/ $3.99 delivery charge), lesson learned we wont use this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I don't EVER leave reviews, usually I can find an excuse for service like \"maybe they were having a bad day?\" Not this time..... We ordered a bowl without chicken for our 1 1/2 year old child, when we got our food the bowl had chicken in it,  even though we didn't order chicken. Luckily this didn't matter at all as we knew our child wouldn't eat the chicken anyway so we just accepted it. When the lady who took our order came by she saw that there was chicken in the child's bowl, she got angry and said we didn't pay chicken, to which we replied no we didn't but it's alright he won't eat the chicken - thinking that she was accepting it was their fault, but without saying another word the women snatched the bowl from our child as he was getting a bite!!!!! And walked back to the kitchen leaving our 1 1/2 year old screaming!! Who the freak does that!!??? Who takes a child's meal away from them? We were so stunned! We yelled at her what are you doing!? But she just walked back to the kitchen. We had to comfort him and try to figure out what to do next. Within a couple minutes she walked back out with a new bowl with no chicken... No \"sorry\" or anything, not an ounce of care in the world that she had literally just stolen the child's food away because of a small amount of chicken? I would have just handed her a $5 bill!!! Amazing... Absolutely amazing that people like this exist and we have to exist with them. Don't misunderstand, I wish I had an excuse for her, something like \"well our kids were being bad\" or something! But there truly was absolutely no excuse for being treated like that as a paying customer... Will never go back, that women is in the wrong industry."}
{"text":"My go to place for healthy lunch, love the staff SUPER NICE!  Everything is fresh and location is always kept clean.  My husband and I love their salads!"}
{"text":"I got a deal on Groupon and received it even cheaper thanks to T-Mobile Tuesdays app. And the guy who helped was so friendly and helpful. So service was great but the food was nasty, I don't understand how this place has so many good reviews. My mom and I got hot bowls with chicken and the noodles weren't that soft or tasty, the rice was hard and the teriyaki flavor in general the whole bowl didn't have a great flavor. Never coming back here again. I am so glad I only paid a little bit (thanks to my deal) because I would have thrown like $23 in the trash for this place. There are way better places."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty alternative to fast food. Reasonably priced and food is all freshly made. Very clean."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place because it really does have decent prices and selections. The employees were really nice and explained the menu to us. I got the chicken hot bowl with sesame sauce. It is freshly made to order but the problem is that my bowl was swimming in sauce. I wanted to give it a chance but as I was eating it, the sauce was just way too much so we asked if they could do anything and they just gave us more rice but now I'm skeptical to come back because they might douse my meal in sauce again. Hopefully if I do come back, it'd be a different experience."}
{"text":"We just had Fresh Millions catered (via Ezcater) and I gotta say, the Panini's are DELICIOUS!  We got the steak, and the chicken avocado ones..  They are huge, and packed full of flavor!!  Definitely will order again!!"}
{"text":"Great concept! Closest thing to a salad bar you can get around town. We really enjoyed building our own bowls and we both got Thai curry sauce which was good. The chicken was chopped a little small for my taste so it was a bit dry."}
{"text":"Very excited about this new place! I got a Cesar salad and it was the best salad I've ever had. They make the salad In front of you and make sure everything looks good for your personal choice. They also give you a huge amount and I ate it all it was so good!"}
{"text":"Fresh Million had one of the greatest salad I tried. I typically order the Southwest Chicken Salad which is amazing. However, this time they didn't hear me well enough that I want my dressing ON the salad. The guy decided to put it on the side, which was very little. place was very quiet. No employees were in the front of the store.

Note: Want your sauce on the side. Ask for a extra side (they shouldn't charge you because it's less than what they normally put)"}
{"text":"Food was really good. We ordered two paninis, two salads, and a kids bowl. All were very good and everything is freshly made. Staff is friendly and fast. Prices are very reasonable, especially given the quality of the food.

We ate here at around 5:30 on a Monday and it was steady - not too busy."}
{"text":"Guys, seriously, GUYS! Not Kidding. This place. THIS place, the best. EVER!

Now that I have that exclamation out of my system, you really can't miss with this place. They have about 4 different ways to enjoy their food, but like their name states, about a Million ways to enjoy their Fresh variety. The fresh standard they have for their ingredients makes the food they prepare taste amazing. I love the hot bowls and how they are immidiatly wok cooked. Highly suggest making this place a lunch time stop."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places. I ordered a Cobb salad minus the blue cheese I substituted feta instead. They mixed all the ingredients in a bowl and then hand tossed it for me. It was truly a moving experience. The food is fresh and the place is really clean. You must try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Thank God for Yelp! Was able to come across this gem while driving through this particular hood. Fresh Millions is a unique concept - the froyo of healthy food selections. Choose a base, sauce, meat, and four additional mix in's. The amount of food you get in one bowl will most likely leave you with leftovers as well. There is also an amazing promotional deal ($8 for $20) so take advantage of the greatness while you can. Will be back, despite the drive from over in Ahwatukee Foothills."}
{"text":"I'm extremely impressed by the quality of ingredients! Came for a free panini offer but the chicken is fresh and perfectly cooked, the tomatoes are fresh not soggy like you get other sandwich places, and the panini bread is soft in the inside yet nicely grilled on the outside. Like I said, very impressed!"}
{"text":"Very clean, fresh and delicious. I was very impressed with my salad. The employee was very welcoming and friendly and answered all of our questions. I'm impressed and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My two teenagers love going to Ike's Sandwich Shop which is next-door. One day we meandered over to Fresh Millions. We've been going back-and-forth between the two ever since. I love Ike's but not all the bread. Fresh Millions fills you up with healthy combinations. We seem to be heading to Fresh Millions more and more. My favorite bowl is the shrimp bowl with half white rice and half spinach - with Alfredo sauce and my four mix-ins are red onions, black beans, black olives and scallions - YUMMY! The Alfredo sauce was flavorful yet not too heavy, the shrimp were larger than expected and the combination hit the spot."}
{"text":"Fresh Millions is a fast-casual \"eat healthy\" concept food chain that has endless combinations available from their menu. They offer lunch or dinner entrees that include made-to-order gourmet salads with a variety of mix-ins, hot bowls, soups, and grilled paninis. They first opened in 2015 and locations have been popping up all over the Valley since then. People love choices these days and Fresh Millions allows you to choose what you want on your entree. You basically order on one side of the stainless-steel counter, pick your toppings, pay at the other side of the counter and take your food to a table. For bowls, you choose your base (brown rice, noodles, spinach, romaine, etc), a protein (chicken, shrimp, steak, tofu), a sauce (basil pesto, Thai peanut, green curry, etc) and four mix-ins. You can even go half-and-half base and do rice and romaine/spinach. The cooks will mix and sauté up your creation and you can watch the magic happen right over the counter as they are an open kitchen. For the little ones, they have a healthy fresh kids' menu. If you are in a hurry and don't want typical unhealthy greasy fast food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Roadtrippin it through Arizona and this place popped up on places to eat. Definitely a go to place. Prices are fair and food quality was good, my chicken was a little on the dry side but overall I enjoyed it. Half noodles/spinach with the sweet and spicy sauce (which he recommended) and buncha veggies. My boyfriend got the steak panini and he loved it! If you haven't been here before give it a try you won't be disappointed! 
Staff was really friendly and helped me out!"}
{"text":"Finally, a lunch spot one can score in the Sun Valley that isn't going to make you fat, fatter or the fattest guy in Mesa (as prestigious as these accolades may sound to you it is much sweatier than you may expect)!

There are several specialty salads to choose from such as the Cobb salad, BBQ Chopped, Southwest and Mandarin Chicken salads.  Feel free and design your own salad with a plethora of toppings to choose from; just about everything that grows under the sun or even the shade (mushrooms).

Now that you're all veggied-up and ready to rock n' roll,  go get back to work with a smile on your face and extra loops available on your belt line.

Long live skinny jeans!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Great portions and tasty options! Delivery is quick and they are always consistent and delicious! I love that everything tastes fresh and you can make your own bowl different every time! I've eaten here so many times, I've lost count! Let's hope they open one in Maricopa!"}
{"text":"This place was just ok. I bought a groupon for it but if I didn't have anther Groupon to use I don't think i'd be back. It's nothing special, the price is a bit much for what you get, the flavor is ok. It's all just right around the 3 star range."}
{"text":"I love the format of this restaurant.  The bowl choices are great.  Pick your base (noodles, rice, lettuce, etc), then mix-ins (various meats and veggies), then the sauce. I got noodles and Szechwan.  It was spicy, be ready for it.   My wife got teriyaki.  She thought it was a bit to sweet.

All in all, very fast service, a lot of food and only $8.00.  Not the best in the world, but still very good for a quick lunch.  Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"We ordered through grubhub tonight and it came immediately, but we noticed right away that it was the wrong order.  I called and they were awesome.  They showed up at our house again 15 minutes later with the correct items, which were all delicious. We will definitely order again or stop in.  Great food and amazing service.  Bravo!"}

{"text":"Best place in mesa to get a healthy combination. The staff is great and clean.  I recommended this place for you to try."}
{"text":"Incredibly impressed with this place! Hot rice bowls (think Japanese style), fresh salads, and Paninis. Stumbled onto it while visiting a place nearby and had to stop by. It's my new favorite place for a delicious, healthy, and filling 

The serving size is perfect - enough to save for later. I recommend the half spinach and half brown rice chicken bowl with a ton of veggies.  



My only complaint is the name. It's hard to know what this place is without walking in and checking out the menu. I hope they keep their current serving size and quality of veggies. Coming back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places of all time! If you're looking for something on the healthy side but still delicious and cheap this is your place. The manager Sal is amazing and one of the reasons this restaurant is so great. I refer everyone here, I have YET to have a poor experience and I've been coming here regularly since they've opened. If you haven't tried it, try it SOON, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great place for a simple and fresh lunch at reasonable prices and good portions.  Have your lunch made to your taste buds. Service is quick and you working lol leave content."}
{"text":"Great food.  Felt like it was very healthy and tasty.  I got the bacon bowl and my girlfriend got the Buffalo Chicken Pannini.  The pannini was a great value at only $6.  The side salad had chicken.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"As of 9/9/15, they  are still offering their Grand Opening Special of $6 for hot bowls, salads, panini or wraps. Great deal!"}
{"text":"I would eat here everyday if I could. Although there are so many options I always choose the same thing, shrimp hot bowl with half spinach and half noodles, soy chili sauce, scrambled egg and veggies. The food is fresh, the restaurant clean, the prices reasonable and the service is always pleasant. There is something here for everyone, including some  good options for kids."}
{"text":"Best salad I have had in a long time. I used my free food coupon from the mail and got the BBQ chicken salad. It had tons of fresh greens, corn, black beans, chicken chunks in BBQ sauce, and tortilla strips. Topped with a tangy BBQ ranch dressing.NOTE: the BBQ sauce on the chicken is pretty spicy so be aware if you are not into that kind of thing. Great salad for a regular price of $7.95. 

I saw them make some paninis for a delivery and they looked huge too. They have plenty of vegan offerings and a nice-sized kids menu. 

This place is spotless. There was nobody there when I arrived (2:30 on a Sunday) but the 3 employees were busy cleaning the entire time I was eating my late lunch.

I recommend this place and will be going back to try their bowls next."}
{"text":"Like yc Mongolian BBQ but cleaner. Everything is behind glass and only touched by employees until it's brought to you. Worth checking out, everything is fresh.  A great addition to this area."}
{"text":"this place is so good!! alot of variety in foods and alot of options to customize it. very friendly staff. :)"}
{"text":"Got a coupon deal. Service is on point and the food is delicouse. Hot bowl and salad are worth me writing my first review. Place was that good"}
{"text":"Tried the Panini tonight. I didn't care for it much, and it wasn't that filling either. Mostly bread that was way crunchy. My wife loved her hot bowl though. Live and learn."}
{"text":"I was super disappointed in this place.  The ambiance is basic but I was taking a salad to go so that was no big deal.  Wanted to just create my own salad with the options but found that process confusing.  You only get three free toppings.  All salads come with chicken even if you are a vegetarian.  They did allow me to sub eggs after I asked/complained.  Got a yummy salad but it was over $11.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"I've ordered to-go hot bowls  with Romanies as a base. There are great choice of base, protein, sauce and mix-ins. Tasty, healthy and prepared in just a couple of minutes. Just perfect."}
{"text":"Food was fresh, healthy and delicious! The service great. He knew what we were trying order even though we mixed up the name of the veggies more than once.  

The prices are also very reasonable and the restaurant is very clean! 

You may develop an addiction to this place, you've been warned!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's close to my gym so I get fresh, healthy, quality food every time I need to get lunch and it's reasonably priced. Salad and Go is within walking distance but I always opt to get in my truck and drive across the street to this place. The kitchen is clean, the food is fresh (especially the greens) and the staff is fantastic. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Definitely will be here again! Customizable hot bowls? Yes please. They have a ton of options and great prices. A meal under $10 is hard to find these days!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times, but finally got around to writing a review. I usually get the chicken tikka masala panini, primarily because that's one item that stood out in the menu (for me at least), everything else seemed familiar to what I've had before. I loved it the first time I had it, and have continually gone back and ordered the same item. Today was the first time I ordered something along with the panini, and it was the chicken hot bowl (per the server's suggestion as it's their signature item) and liked it as well. Their portions are generous, and the food is fresh. The ambience is nice and quiet, and their generous yelp deals and cash back offers make this place even more worth it."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. I ordered a grilled chicken panini and a southwestern salad. McDonalds has better salads. The sandwich was totally dry, rubbery chicken, barely any sauce, way too much bread. Salad tasted like washed lettuce with a few stale vegetables. Pretty much the biggest disappointment of my life."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Loved how fresh it tasted. We got the southwest wrap and it was great. Fresh spinach and romaine really give it a fresh crisp touch. Would definitely recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Excellent hot food and their salads are delicious. A great healthy and tasty option. I've eaten here many times, and never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They are fast it is good quality meats fresh ingredients. I like that it's fully customizable. The pricing is not bad & generous portions! Perfect lunch spot!! Hasn't disappointed :-)"}
{"text":"Intresting concept but needs some refinement.

For some odd reason the hot bowl gets more veggie options than the salad when you BYO salad so my wife and I both opted for bowls.

My thai peanut noodles with tofu and a few veggies was decent, but not all that filling. I think the key here for healthy is smaller portion. My wife's Tiki masala bowl did not impress us with the lack of flavor.

I was also disappointed that the soda fountain options were rather pedestrian coke products."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  My hubby and I are regulars. . I don't feel guilty eating out now cuz the food is so healthy.  My fave is the grilled  chicken and avocado Panini. Delish!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming. It was amazing! So many options and customizations. I had the buffalo chicken panini and it was good! The panini was so big I definitely could have split it with someone! The bread was also amazing. I have never had such great bread on a panini!"}
{"text":"I like this place. This little strip mall is full of places to eat. I'm on my 3/6 places so far and I like this one the best. Fresh and home made. I had the chicken Caesar wrap. Staff was uber friendly and I'll definitely be back!!
I got my order to go so I could eat it on the road, glad I stopped!!!"}
{"text":"The service was fantastic. The salads were fresh,excellent choices and good prices. A healthy choice with a flare of your choice. Very impressed. It's nice to see a place where people seem happy to be at work. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Way good! We stopped in here by happenstance and loved it. They have a wide selection of food, it's not just one type. I got a hot bowl with steak and noodles so it was kinda like mongollian food. It was great. Definitely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"I have never written a review on Yelp before, but this is a must. I ordered a kids veggies and pasta for my baby and food for me and my toddler as well, went to pay, and by the time I got back to my table where my baby was already set up in his high chair, his pasta was in front of him. But here's where it gets crazy, the girl came to our table, saw that my baby's pasta had chicken in it (I didn't ask for it), she said you didn't pay for the chicken and TOOK IT AWAY. And my baby started screaming!! Who takes food from a baby??? They take 5 mins to bring him back his pasta with now no chicken. Side note: I used a yelp deal and was well over $1.50 under the amount of my coupon which would covered the chicken. I expressed my frustration and they didn't even respond. THE worst customer service I have ever ever ever had.

Sadly, I left out another part when I was ordering. I asked my toddler if he wanted chicken and rice or grilled cheese and he said grilled cheese. 1 min later while I'm still ordering, he said \"mom I want chicken and rice!\" So I ask the guy to change it and he says no, It's already being made!!! This has never happened to me ever!!! They are always willing to change!

The food was good, but the customer service was so upsetting and bad that I won't step foot in there again."}
{"text":"The food here is decent. I like that you pick exactly what you want in your bowl. I am a picky eater so I enjoy places that have the build your own option. The staff is friendly and very little wait time for your food."}
{"text":"Came here after looking at yelp in the area and glad we did. The server was patient and explained the process to us as well as offered suggestions. The food was hot and fresh and customizable to each person. I don't doubt their claim that there are a million selections. You choose a base such as noddles, pasta, spinach, romaine etc and then choose a meat, a sauce and 4 mix ins. Even my kids would like this place. Got a group deal from the yelp app that was $20 worth of food for $8. Our total with that came to 3 and some change so we spent less than $12 on lunch for the two of us. By checking in on yelp I received a free bowl on my next visit. I don't live near this place but if I am ever in the area again I will return."}
{"text":"My new favorite place!!! Great meals for vegans and carnivores both! I recommend the Tofu Hot Bowl. Yummy! I wanna eat there every day! :)"}
{"text":"Wowsers!!! This is damn good food. The shimp panini... Lawd have mercy my knees buckled after I tasted it's perfect blend of shrimp and avocados, on a delish fluffy panini bread. We also ordered two chicken bowls one with sweet and spicy sauce one similar to a burrito bowl, both amazing. Portion sizes are large, delivery was fast and friendly. I'm eating it right now, it's that good I couldn't wait to review it. Great bang for your buck!!"}
{"text":"Being from California, we were immediately attracted to the presentation that Fresh Millions had behind the counter.  After finding out that this establishment is from S.F., I could now connect the dots.  The salad bar looked so colorful, fresh and inviting.  The staff were friendly, efficient and spot on.  We had the Steak Panini w/side salad and the Chicken Avocado Panini w/side salad as well.  The bread was very fresh and both were cooked and presented to perfection.  The cool thing about the side salad was that 'you' picked out what you wanted in it!!  Wonderful!!!!  Very simple, however, very fresh.  Overall bang for buck was well worth it.  Service, presentation, quality and taste were all superb!!  :)  This place is absolutely worth looking up!!  :)"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to get a hot healthy dinner or lunch entree. That's what we had for our first time. It's great that it is fast friendly and just good portions in general. I had a southwesty bowl. You get to choose what you want which is awesome. I saw this place in my mail but forgot the little coupon thing! bummer!

I could eat here every night probably since it is so affordable, especially when I'm too lazy to cook ha!"}
{"text":"I don't know why there's never anyone here!!!!! This place is my absolute favorite and go to when I'm in a rush. 

Essentially it's subway for stir fry-- but also salads and panini's and wraps... Or whatever. So basically subway for everyone. 

It is always clean and always pretty quiet. Lots and lots of options! My go to is the shrimp hot bowl with noodles and teriyaki with water chestnuts, garbanzo beans, bean sprouts and bell pepper. But you can literally have whatever suits your fancy.

Also, the service is always great! Super friendly and funny people working here. 

There are no downsides to eating here. PLEASE COME HERE OH GOODNESS ITS AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect as I had never been here before. It took me a while to figure out how to order from the menu. 

If I didn't have the Yelp deal, I don't know that it would have been worth it. It was a little pricey for the whole family.

I ordered the chicken avocado panini and it was much larger than I expected. It very filling and I love the bread they use, I think its Armenian bread.

My son got a shrimp bowl and I thought they could have put a few more shrimp in there for the price, I think he only got 4-5.

This seems likes a very healthy option for lunch/dinner and service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Phenomenal and delicious and so many different combos the cook is outstanding make a bowl of your choice of meats sauces and fresh veggies.
Will be back!!! And the owner so friendly"}
{"text":"Excellent ingredients. Some of the crispiest, freshest salads. Salads are large portions. Hot bowls are tasty and filling."}
{"text":"Good, quick, healthy food. I stopped by because of the yelp reviews and was very pleased with the staff and freshness of the food. Although I live out of town, I plan on returning on my next visit."}
{"text":"I love eating at places that strive to offer fresh, real, food. This fast casual location is doing just that. Very attentive and friendly service. Would visit again."}
{"text":"I love healthy options. I got the chicken hot bowl on spinach with some fresh veggie add ins and it was pretty tasty! The paninis and salads also looked great. Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food. I ordered the Chicken Bowl and it was great. The price was very affordable too. Staff was friendly and helpful. I definitely plan on going back."}
{"text":"Had an opportunity I try Fresh Millions Restaurant today while using a free Groupon. I am so glad that I did not have to use my money to eat here. For $21 we had a rice bowl, panini, drink, and two bags of chips. Now in my opinion this restaurant was a little lack luster. The panini was dry and way to much bread. The cheese was not melted and there was very little meat. The rice bowl did not look \"fresh\" at all. Instead it mostly looked like slop. 
I am really concerned about the storage of their salads. Although in a cooler the salad was in open bins that had condiments and random items stored above. I was too grossed out to even imagine ordering a salad because of the risk of having contaminated items falling from above."}
{"text":"So rude and the guy was counting the vegetables as he was putting them into n my bowl wth won't be back lames"}
{"text":"The sauces are awesome and if you want to avoid any certain foods because of intolerances or preferences, this place gives you that freedom."}
{"text":"They were very patient with us since we were taking awhile to order. Lots of combinations to choose from! I got the signature salad and my husband got the steak hot bowl.  My salad was huge! Everything was fresh and delicious, I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"You get what you want, the flavor you want, for a very very good price. We had four different sauces and all were good. Clean, fast and friendly. Pretty easy try for something new. A bit like Korean style BBQ, the different choices on what you can put it on: Pasta, lomein, salad, or mix em."}
{"text":"Beware!!!!!!    Very Rude staff. That lady which serves to people always looks pissed off and says bad stuff to their customers. There was a nice old man asking for some change in order she refused so rudely and when that nice man asked to see the manager she said I am the manager in very rude tone. Also that old man said \"something is wrong with this place\" and she did not even acknowledge that. Just kept rudely staring at that guy. Please beware."}
{"text":"Free lunch due to a coupon sent to my home. Yeh! I tried the \"chicken hot bowl\" (usually $7.95, but currently at a $6 intro price). I got it on brown rice, Thai peanut sauce, and 4 mix-ins (I chose cucumbers, spring onions, carrots, and broccoli). The Thai peanut sauce had no peanut flavor, in fact no flavor at all. The chicken was moist chunks of chicken breast. I would have preferred more cooking of the broccoli and carrots, but would have skipped cooking the spring onions and cucumbers (they would have added a fresh note if they had been left raw). 

Since the store is new, it is not surprising it looks clean and fresh. Decor is sparse, with just 3 posters of the food on the stark white walls. There are 8 tables and chairs. Parking is ample and close to the door. 

I am concerned that they are located too far from MCC and Desert Banner hospital to benefit from those populations and that they have way to much fast food competition at this location. They are right next to my favorite sandwich shop, Ike Loves, and also have Yogi's Grill, In N Out Burger, Carl's Jr, McDonalds, a cheesesteak and gyro shop, Smashburger, and Chipolte all within walking distance. I wish them well, but they have sure chosen a tough location."}
{"text":"I used the 8 for 20 deal on Yelp. When you walk in you are able to sit down and review a paper menu. This was helpful as I have not been here before. 

I was more impressed with their southwestern wrap. It tasted really fresh and could very well be used for 2 separate meals. The green curry chicken bowl and the steak panini was not impressive."}
{"text":"This new place is worth a try.  During their Grand Opening (not sure how long that lasts) many menu items are reduced to just $6.00.  Customize your Hot Bowl, Panini, Salad or Wrap with an abundance of fresh veggie options.

The space is sparsely decorated, but lends itself to a clean, neat appearance.  The staff is friendly and the service is quick.  I'm not sure if something has changed since the time other reviewers posted, but the portion sizes were ample, not small, as others felt.  I will say I expected the Steak Hot Bowl might include Asian style noodles, but they seemed more like spaghetti.  The Chicken Panini was good, but could have used a little more flavor...maybe something as simple as a little salt.  The quality of the meats was adequate for the quick serve price point, though I'd be happy to pay a little more to kick it up a notch.

Overall, I'm happy with Fresh Millions.  A few little tweaks and this concept can go from good to great!"}
{"text":"good food, serviced could be improved a bit - would appreciate if servers smile more"}
{"text":"Really like the food when on point. Too bad the consistency of good food is poor. Certain days you order and get really good food, the kind that makes you recommend a place. Then you have the bad days,regret. \"Did I really recommend this?!??!\" 

Just ordered from here, safe to say won't be back."}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to get to this great place!!  I got a taste of their menu at Fad Frenzy, and have been anxious to get back.  Today I got the Chicken Hot Bowl with Southwest Chipotle sauce and it was amazing.  The staff was super friendly and helpful since it was my first visit.  I will definitely be going back soon!!"}
{"text":"I'm downgrading here from 5 stars for two reasons:
The amount of shrimp is extremely inconsistent. the first time I went it was literally 2 shrimp cut up into smaller pieces. Second time, it was 4 or 5 whole shrimp which I think is totally acceptable, and then the last time I went it was 3 shrimp. That inconsistency is irritating.

Second, the first time I had snickerdoodles they were delish. Sooo soft. This last time they were hard as rocks. My bf commented that one of them tasted weird and I looked at it and the cookie was moldy. What a waste of money. Rotate your products and throw them out when they're bad!!!!!!!!! 

I'd recommend coming here still but proceed with caution when it comes to the baked goods."}
{"text":"My first time here an I was pleasantly surprised. I had a noodle bowl with chicken.  Awesome! It's going to be a regular stop!"}
{"text":"We were very impressed the first time we stopped here, and we weren't disappointed this time either. We've now tried a few different combinations of the hot bowls (the tikka masala with steak and tofu and the sesame chili & soy with steak and tofu one time and steak, egg and tofu the other) and a salad (BBQ chicken). All of the ingredients are super fresh and delicious. The staff is friendly and accommodating. We will keep going back. I wonder if we're in their delivery area..."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.  The BOGO check-in offer from Yelp really made this a good value.  First time I ordered the meatball special, and the second time I ordered the cajun sausage special.  The format here is that you select your \"base\" (rice, noodles, etc), your protein (chicken, meatballs, steak, etc), and four add-ons (onion, peppers, cucumber, etc).  They cook it up for you and serve it all together in a bowl.

First the meatballs.  It was a little skimpy on the meatballs, but had good flavor.  I opted for the basil-pesto sauce since these were supposed to be Italian meatballs.  The pesto was pretty good too.  The two worked well in combination.

My wife ordered the Southwest salad and said it was good.  Yes, i forgot to mention that they also have salads here.

Second visit was the sausage.  First problem, if this is a cajun-style sausage then which sauce should one use?  Obviously you can use any you want, but it doesn't seem to me that Szechuan (for example) is going to work.  There was no Cajun sauce.  Finally I guessed and said \"Chipotle\".  Well, the Chipotle sauce was fine.  Had a kick to it.  But totally covered the Cajun sausage (which I was afraid it might).  Wasn't bad, but I think if they are going to offer a topping of a specific cuisine (Cajun, Italian, whatever) they should have a sauce appropriate to that cuisine.  For the meatballs they did, and it was good.  For the sausage they didn't and it wasn't as good.  Second problem, they were skimpy with the sausage just as they were skimpy with the meatballs.

Overall we're happy with the food given the price paid.  However, once it's not BOGO anymore I would have to be more critical because the value isn't there.  When you pay over $8 for a bowl the cost of a few extra meatballs or a few more slices of sausage isn't much, and they would have made the meal more satisfying.  They were generous with the other stuff, but not the protein.  Hopefully they can fix that.  

Their \"add-ons\" appear to be very fresh, so that's a positive.

So I can't really say I'm a fan, but they certainly are OK and I would not be surprised if we visit them again (especially since they are so convenient to the podiatrist who is treating my broken foot).  I think we have one Yelp BOGO left in the family (we've used two so far...wife and daughter...mine is next)."}
{"text":"Food alone, i would give this place a 4 or even a 5. Everything looks fresh and I have enjoyed the few meals I have had here. 

Management however is pretty bad and may be the thing that keeps me from coming here again. I found this place on yelp and it is well reviewed. They were running $20 for $8 deal and it was a must go for me. Bowls are about $9-$10 so I figured I'd get one for lunch and save one for dinner. As I get ready to pay, the manager (Preti) comes over and says I need to eat both bowls in the building to use the deal. Seemed strange to me and after a few minutes of back and forth I said I didn't want either bowl. At that point, the deal became valid again. I sat there and ate one bowl while getting the stink eye most of the time. 

I was looking for a good, quick lunch spot today when yelp alerted me of a \"free bowl\" deal for checking in to this place. I decided to give it another try. Showed the worker the deal, BEFORE ordering to confirm it was valid and one I could use.  It was confirmed and I went on with my order, added a few extras and a drink so they'd make something off of me. I go to pay and guess who comes over? Preti! Says the deal is actually a buy one get one free. I had her look at the deal, which does not say \"buy one, get one\" but rather \"Free bowl or panini for check in\". I asked her to show me where it said this and her response was \"I'm telling you, do you want to get the free bowl and pay for this one, or just pay for this one?\"  First, that's rude but also makes zero sense. As I am talking, she calls the owner who says the same thing. I explained that the time of payment probably isn't the best time change the deal up and told them all I would be going somewhere else for lunch."}
{"text":"My family loves this place! We get take out from here at least once a week. My favorite is the thai green curry veggie bowl, it's so good! Thank you Fresh Millions!!!"}
{"text":"Diet Coke (but really small glasses). The food itself tastes very good . Loved the chicken chipotle chicken panini I had. Chips were good chocolate chip cookie was seriously stale. Decor is nothing to write home about. Staff was polite. Can't wait to try a bowl they look very good. Worth a try - but guys that tiny pop cup could send me to the place a couple doors down. Got my addictions! :-)"}
{"text":"First visit yesterday for lunch.  Bowl with chicken, noodles and veggies lightly smothered in teriyaki.  Fast service.  Hot food!  Tasted good.  Fiji-guy behind the counter was helpful in how to order."}
{"text":"Had the chicken hot bowl. Food was decent at best. Would have rated 2 stars but it also gave me food poisoning. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great place! Tried it with the $8 for $20 deal on yelp and was very impressed. Will be back. Quick food, with good prices,that is made right and with good ingredients. Refreshing to find in this McDonald's-centered country we live in."}
{"text":"This place is very delicious and fresh like it's name. I love the hot bowls and the variety you can have there. Plus the bread is AMAZING! Here's my down side there needs to be more seating and an extra add in for the veggie hot bowls."}
{"text":"Great selection of fresh bowls.  i has the thai peanut with chicken.  had a little kick but really good."}
{"text":"First Time, Decent Low Cost Food

I got a $20 gift certificate for eight dollars through the yelp app. I thought at this price how could you go wrong getting a little bite to eat for lunch.

I got a chicken with noodles hot bowl and it was pretty good. You get to pick three things to put in your food and after that they start charging you $.50 to a dollar more for each additional vegetable or topping.

The service was OK, nothing super exciting but they got me through the process I got my food sat down and ate and left.

All in all I would give the food about a 3 1/2 star rating year. I gave them four stars because I got the super good deal on it so that bump them up to half star. Not a bad spot to go for it an inexpensive lunch or other meal."}
{"text":"I start with 3 stars. This is my first time here.  I brought my hubby along. Soooo.. we had many questions and the nice clerk helped us thru all the choices.  I had a shrimp hot bowl with thai peanut sauce, double cabbage, onions and mushrooms and noodles. Right idea wrong combo. The noodles are pasty and mushy.  Sooo next time i will have white rice and add pineapple. Hubby had steak hot biwl, red peppers,  broccoli,  celery and cabbage with teriyaki sauce.   It was delicious.  We also split a shrimp and avocado panini sandwich. The bread was fresh and warm. The shrimp was cold. It was just right.
I will be back again!!! If it is just as good, then 4 or 5 stars is possible."}
{"text":"The food at Fresh Millions was very good and great customer service as well! Both my husband and I tried their Hot Bowls and thought they were delicious. Perfect portion sizes. This will be one of our go-to restaurants when we want something quick and healthy for dinner for less than $20."}
{"text":"BANGING! Tried it today on a whim and couldn't have been happier with the food! Great service and awesome food. Recommend the steak or chipotle chicken panini"}
{"text":"The staff is pleasant and the food is fresh every time, and they never skimp on the good stuff like artichokes or avocado. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I have had food delivered a few times now from Fresh Millions. This is probably my favorite place to get a sandwich these days! I don't think I have had a authentic Panini before eating at Fresh Millions so maybe thats part of it but they have to have the best bread I have eaten that wasn't homemade. 

My personal favorites here are. 

The Steak Panini: 
This is kind of like a Philly Cheese Steak but with not in a hoagie roll. We have ordered this a few times now and each time it has been delicious. 

Chicken Tikka Masala: 
This was a little like curry on a sandwich. It was delicious. 

Buffalo Chicken Salad:
Wow this was a great salad. Their buffalo chicken sauce was great! 

Each time I have ordered the deliver guy has showed up in less than an hour."}
{"text":"I went to the Chandler location with 3 coworkers today. I had the chicken & avocado panini, and it was HUGE. I didn't know how big it was going to be, so I added a side caesar salad. A couple of coworkers got the Hot Bowls, which are also very generously sized. I was a little worried about the chipotle mayo overpowering the flavor of the chicken and avocado, but it was mild, and complimented the other flavors. The price was reasonable for the quantity of food. I got the panini, side salad and drink for $10.55."}
{"text":"I loved my chicken avocado panini. The bread was so fluffy and fresh. My husband had the chicken bowl with tikka masala. It was ok but I would recommend tikka masala elsewhere over this one. They had a great deal on Yelp so we got a pretty big dinner for 2 people only $8!!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Delicious, affordable food! Everything on the menu sounds uniquely tasty. We tried the Thai Green Curry bowl & the Tikka Masala panini both were fabulous! I love the way you can have Spinach as a base for your bowl! Or you can half Spinach, half rice. The panini bread was perfect! Our kids had their own kids bowls & they loved them and they are cheaper than most other places."}
{"text":"The paninis are really good. Beware! The Schwann sauce is extremely spicy if you choose that for a bowl."}
{"text":"Great food! Had the steak panini it was delish! Great customer service. New place nothing fancy but food is what matters most right?"}
{"text":"Great service!! First time here and they explained the menu with me with great patience. Great food."}
{"text":"Staff was completely rude when I tried to order so I walked out. A simple \"may I help you\" would work over the rudeness of the staff. I left without ordering and went to a better place. It doesn't matter how good your food is. There's no excuse for a bad attitude."}
{"text":"Their food is definitely healthier than most and they make it from scratch. The selections they have are plenty and I always have something else new to try every time I go. Use the deals that Yelp offers especially if you are a first timer there."}
{"text":"Great service the friendliest staff you will ever meet.  Hot bowl consists of 4 Fresh vegetable mix in' s, choice of various rices, or noodles or half and half and choice of sauce.  About 8 bucks per bowl.  Great for a quick bite cooked fresh from fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"We had a pesto hot chicken bowl and a Chipotle hot chicken bowl, the choices for mixins were plenty and fresh. We will be back..very clean as well. Hoping quinoa become a choice for base besides rice or pasta.  But the fact that you can do half and half bases makes the selections even better."}
{"text":"Came here on my lunch today and it was not busy but wow were these people slow. They all seemed like they didn't know what was going on. I ordered the Greek wrap( hold the red onion and pepperonis). It didn't include chicken even though it was the same price as another wrap that had chicken. It was mostly all greens, and a few mix ins and dressing in a tortilla. The flavor was so so. Not gross but not delicious. I threw the second half away because it wouldn't keep. It was over priced in my opinion. Doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Shared a chicken bowl with peanut sauce and steak panini, was wonderful.  Side salad was a great addition.  very clean and organazed.  Will return!"}
{"text":"3rd time here and never disappointing. I had to up review to 5 stars. The food is so reasonably priced and the quality is superb."}
{"text":"Gave this a try for the first time yesterday. We finished up our day at Golf Land and I as starving but wanted something healthy to eat so we went here. I had a salad that I loaded up with all the things I love and then had it tossed with a light balsamic dressing. The salad was big and all of the ingredients were fresh and tasty. The guys who work there are super nice, friendly and helpful. Really enjoyed my first experience!"}
{"text":"Seems fresh, tasted alright. There are better Mongolian BBQ type places out there, but this is sort of the Chipotle version of them, and it's really not bad for the price. 
The staff seem nice enough, and the place was kept clean. If I'm hungry and in the area again, I just may stop in and try a panini."}
{"text":"What a joke went there at 8pm on a Thursday soon as we walked in nothing but dirty looks especially from the manager they should have turned off the open sign if they didn't want anyone to come in.. We never been there so  we expressed that and ask what would they recommend the manager looked at me with a sense of discuss. We order the chicken avocado panni bread wasn't even toasted the service sucked."}
{"text":"Warning, this fresh millions lacks customer service! This was my first visit and I didn't know how the ordering worked. The employee behind the counter did not help even though I asked for it and there were no other customers except my party of four. In addition, he did not let us use both Groupons even though they came from two different accounts.  I paid first. Then the next person in my party(of four) tried to use his and was refused. The manager was called and the manager said \"no\"... I called Groupon and Groupon refunded the unused Groupon. The food was too salty and mediocre at best . I would not come back and surmise that this establishment will close its doors when their rental contract expires.  We stayed inside to eat our food during a high peak lunch hour and only two other parties showed within 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Excellent food and lots of choices. Thrilled to have vegan meals at a good price. Hoping they add more Gf and dairy free over time."}
{"text":"I was ecstatic to see this new location, as it is just that much closer to me than the other ones I've been to. Fresh Millions is one of our favorite places to eat and I introduce it to anyone I can! I love that you can come with a group and everyone gets exactly what they want.  Large portions, reasonable prices, friendly staff."}
{"text":"It's ok.  For standard salad you get 2 mix-ins, bowls and sandwhiches come with 4.  When subway, MOD, YC all give you unlimited veggies at no extra charge it makes it feel like they are being stingy.  Most of what you would want to order costs $8/item.  The person who helped us at the counter didn't speak english, environment also feels cheap.  I would rather take my $8 somewhere else."}
{"text":"Delicious food, reasonable prices, friendly staff! Easy to use coupons, groupons, yelp deals, etc.  
Tried the paninis which are excellent and the noodle bowls which are exactly like restaurant quality. This is way higher quality than fast food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered pick up using the yelp app. Yelp said 45 minute wait, so I called to make sure and they said it would be ready in 10. We ordered 3 hot bowls, all different. They had zucchini on their menu, but not on the yelp ordering system. I made a note that I wanted that instead of corn but that didn't happen.  Either one was fine with me though.  
I ordered a chicken hot bowl with spinach and noodles, mushroom, tofu, broccoli and baby corn with soy chili sauce. It was really good. Good sized potion for the price.  I had a bite of my sister's beef bowl with Thai green sauce and that sauce was really good too. There must be a million different combinations you could make, and I bet every one would be delicious. Too bad there isn't any near me in Orange County, CA!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, fresh food and cooked to perfection.  Bowls are great as are the salads.  The crew was outstanding in guiding us as we were there for the first time.  Sure will be back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating here. I keep thinking I'll try something new but I'm a creature of habit. Live the green curried chicken with noodles. My wife loves the chicken masala bowl with rice and almond, mmmm!"}
{"text":"Decided to come use our grand opening coupon and glad we did!! 

I was expecting expensive items but it's pretty reasonable. I got the southwest wrap and it was very flavorful! Average size for a wrap really. 

My wife got the veggie  hot bowl with green curry sauce. It was delicious! Very spicy but great taste. 

Good ingredients too. Nothing tasted cheap or old. 

I'd say well prob be back."}
{"text":"Gluten free Thai peanut dressing had just the right spice kick. Liked the half spinach half rice base option. The variety of toppings means you can have a different experience every visit and determine your own creative combos.  Excellent option for \"fast food\" portioned as one BIG or two small meals."}
{"text":"Fresh and inexpensive, cashier was really friendly. I had a Groupon and it went really far. I covered both mine and my friends meal and still have enough left for a cookie."}
{"text":"If you are on a health kick this is a great place to keep you honest!  I got a hot bowl..which consisted of a base (starch), sauce, protein (including shrimp or tofu) and 4 veggies.  The staff was very friendly and helpful...my veggies could have been cooked a little longer. But I was happy they didn't skimp on the protein or veggies.  Prices are very reasonable...I can see myself stopping here when I don't feel like cooking but still want to eat healthy."}
{"text":"Great food with many different selections for any taste! Szechuan is hot! Just be advised. Bowls are a solid choice. As of this posting they have all menu items are $6!"}
{"text":"First time coming to this restaurant. Ordered a hot bowl chicken, sweet & sour, noodles, broccoli, baby corn, carrot, & cucumber. It was delicious! Definitely coming back to eat her! Will be recommending to other people about this place!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this place. I got the chicken avocado panini which was delicious. They actually forgot the avocado, which they quickly rectified, but it was just as yummy without it. The chipotle sauce is flavorful without being too spicy. Next time I'm gonna try a salad cuz the veggies look super fresh. The staff was also really nice and helpful. Great place all around with a ton of choices."}
{"text":"I liked this place but wanted to like it more... I will say that it is a good healthy option for a fast casual place if you've already wore out Chipotle and similar restaurants. We've been about 10 times and generally liked everything, some sauces are better than others and you can ask to taste test the sauce before you commit :)

The downsides are that the bowls are just not enough for my husband so he's still hungry after we eat here.

Sometimes I would just take my 7 year old for a lunch out, but the only option they had for the kids menu was chicken everything. So when I suggest it she doesn't want to come since she doesn't want chicken. One time a super nice & friendly employee let her sub out the chicken and put bacon on her bowl instead. She loved it. But any other time we returned she was told no. Which is confusing because if you look at the adult bowl prices the bacon bowl is cheaper than the chicken bowl so you'd think the lower cost item would be an OK sub on the kids menu. So even though I'd enjoy coming here I can't really convince anyone else in my family."}
{"text":"Flavor is surprisingly good for healthy menu.

I love it to be able to choose sauces
I had shrimp noodle with coconut sauce, my son had beef dish.
We both like the flavor."}
{"text":"Loved this place. We had lunch on a Sunday and the place was empty basically empty. Food really was fresh!!!  I had a bowl with chicken and noodles and it reminded me of pei wei but healthier. I would love to go back and try other entrees."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem.  Appearances aren't always what they seem.  The ambiance is neutral but the service is exceptional and the food is great.  Our daughter really enjoys this place as well and she can be very picky.  Easy to understand menu with many great options.  The food is obviously fresh, hence the name of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"We got a coupon for a free meal for Fresh Millions, so who am I to give up a free food opportunity?  Looking at the pictures for the food online didn't really make me too excited about trying it, but I was actually pleasantly surprised by our experience.  
I got a hot chicken bowl with a noodle base and a sweet and spicy sauce. I loved the sauce because it reminded me of that yummy sauce they have at Pei Wei to dip your spring rolls in.  Love that stuff.  
My hubby got a Buffalo Chicken Panini and a Chicken salad wrap.  The Buffalo Chicken Panini had great flavor, but the bread was insanely think.  A panini has thin bread that is pressed to be made even thinner.  Their bread overtook the entire sandwich.  His wrap was a little boring because they only let you have two veggie mix ins and he chose ranch dressing.  If he would have chosen a different dressing, he probably would have liked it better.  He said it needed salt and pepper.  
Next time, we'll have a better understanding of what to try.  The man that helped us was very friendly to everyone that walked in."}
{"text":"Came here to pick up food for my team at work. We ordered the paneer hot bowl, tofu hot bowl, and the chicken hot bowl. Both of my coworkers loved their bowls which used thai green curry (spicy btw!), and the sesame soy/chili sauce. I ordered the paneer hot bowl with tikka masala sauce. I was less thrilled with my bowl due to lack of flavor sadly. It was cooked well however and had adequate stir fry \"flavor.\"

Overall, I'll definitely come back to Fresh Millions due to the price and quality of food. I think I will just steer clear of the paneer tikka masala hot bowl from now on and go with one of their other sauces."}
{"text":"#1 you should know that the current \"free bowl, salad or wrap\" offer with check in gives you a BUY 1 Get 1 free. This is fine, but should be disclosed as a B1G1 offer up front. This offer also excludes steak and shrimp which lowers your menu options significantly. They also charge full price for your purchase meal, regardless of everything being $6 for grand opening.

The place is bright and clean and staff was \"adequate\".

I tried the thai peanut noodle bowl with chicken..you get 4 veggies with a hot bowl. I had red bell, cabbage, carrots and zucchini. The sauce was really good. My hubby got the szechuan bowl and says the sauce is super spicy, proceed with caution. Beverage selection is very low here too.

I'd probably come back, but prefer up front marketing, not \"getcha gimmicks\" ..to win repeat customers consider your offers more carefully."}
{"text":"I got the Chipotle Chicken Panini.  It was fairly good, well made, and had good quality chicken.  I think I will try one of the other Panini's when I go next.  The staff are bright and awesome to talk to."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and with the yelp deal made it even better! I didn't think that anything was spectacular-- just fresh food at a decent price. I liked that you can customize your dish in just about any way you can imagine."}
{"text":"This place started out great - large portions of veggies and friendly staff. 

Lately the portions have been cut way back and sometimes they use a cup to measure and other times tongs. Order the broccoli and the portion is super small. 

If they returned to their old ways they would be in good shape."}
{"text":"It's like a cross between YC's Mongolian Grill and subway. They have lots of healthy and vegan options and not so healthy ones ;)

It's a simple place and the staff are always kind to us. You'll be spending around s 7 or 8 bucks a person."}
{"text":"I ordered a bowl to go, close to closing time. The concept is great. You pick your starch, protein and veggies. I ordered a chicken hot bowl with sweet and spicy sauce. It was pretty tasty, although the portion of chicken was scant. Nice and clean inside; service was courteous, but not friendly (probably because I came in 15 min. before closing)."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. I noticed on here that it said they delivered and my address was within their range. Almost all the restaurants around here that deliver to me are either pizza or really bad Thai food, so I got super excited when I saw their menu! The delivery did take a really long time, an hour and 15 minutes, so that was kind of disappointing but the food itself was pretty good. I had the veggie panini. I'll definitely order again from here sometime! Hopefully, delivery will be faster next time."}
{"text":"Simple and fresh! I wish I'd have come here sooner! And the Yelp coupon was icing on the cake. 

Build your salad, wrap, bowl or panini with healthy veggies and hearty protein. 

The ultimate in customizable healthy. 

I'm looking forward to taking advantage of delivery soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent service by friendly, helpful staff.  The wraps are amazing.   Always very fresh and flavorful.  Prices are just right."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Every time I order, the food is delivered quickly and it's delicious!!! Tonight was a unique night. I had my dog injure his leg and wrote on the grubhub note to please not knock when they arrive so the dog wouldn't run and get excited at the door. Other companies completely ignore these notes but Fresh Millions did exactly as asked. They waited in the driveway and called to let me know they were here to keep the dog from injuring himself more. I truly love the food but more so, love great customer service! Thank you Fresh Millions. I will gladly be coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place has such good reviews. My husband and I shared the chicken avocado panini and the chicken stir fry so we could try a couple things. It was mediocre at best. The mayo was smeared on only half the sandwich and the cheese looked half melted. Like something you'd find on a McDonald's burger. So gross. The noodles were so watery and lacking any flavor. My kids both got a kids meal with Alfredo noodles and broccoli..mind you I do NOT have picky eaters. These kids will eat anything. They wouldn't even touch the noodles. It was served with dry pasta and all of the liquidy sauce was at the very bottom. I wanted to talk to someone in charge because we were all so disappointed, but the staff was all run by young kids. Seemingly no manager in sight. Judging by other reviews I'm going to assume this place lacks consistency and we came on a bad night. I doubt we will ever go back again. $30 for an awful meal all the way around."}
{"text":"Not only was the steak salad actually Philly cheesesteak style meat, there were rotten pieces of lettuce in the salad as well. I can get a better salad at subway. Your dressing cup wasn't enough to cover half the salad. I tried a bite of my spouses (buffalo chicken) and no joke it tastes like vomit. Literally vomit. He had rotten pieces of lettuce in his salad too. This place may be better sitting down to eat but the delivery food was nasty."}
{"text":"Tried it due to Group On.... will be back because the food is good! I had the Shrimp hot bowl to go and was still nice and hot when I arrived home. The gentleman taking my order made me feel a bit like I was bothering him but the lady and the young man who served my food were REALLY nice which made up for his personality! :) 
   The shrimp were a nice size, ample amount of shrimp and cooked well.  I had the soy/chili sauce which had just the right kick!  The sauce was light and not overwhelming like a lot of places do which was a plus! The veggies cooked well and the entire bowl portion was a good size! I felt like I got my money's worth easily... it was fresh and yummy!  Will definitely be back to try the sandwiches (Which I saw them making and they looked awesome!)  Nice to have a \"fresh\" new choice in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Owner is very very rude , she tried to tell me how we wanted our food , she tried to charge more for veggies when they were included up to 5 , then on top of that didn't want to honor my Groupon , she was nice to all the \"foreign\" customers Indian and Arab but was rude and wouldn't even look at me in my face ; will not do business here again"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place. Went in at 8 o'clock on Monday night and the employees were so interested in keeping everything clean they paid little or no attention to us.  (They close at nine.)  The big guy behind the counter taking my order was very unfriendly and un-talkative, even after I told him I had never been there before.  I heard one of the employees tell another that they were out of chicken, but I didn't think it would affect me (since no one told me it would). But one of my orders had some weird ground meat on it instead of chicken and the sauce was wrong.  Of course I got my orders to go, so I didn't find out until I got home after grocery shopping and they were already closed. You get one chance to make a first impression and you blew it Fresh Millions! Needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! This chicken hot bowl looks and smells amazing!!! Tastes delicious too!! If you haven't tried this place, put it on your to do list right now!  Completely customisable meals, so you know you're getting something fresh and not just something that's pre made.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time will be back food was very fresh delightful and plenty for vegetables cut up gorgeous you really want to try at all I had Thai peanut sauce over a bed of lettuce and Romain with lots of vegetables it was tasty and enjoyable the server the restaurant is clean the server was good and I will be back here again that is why I'm giving it five stars"}
{"text":"I ordered fresh millions through grub hub for deliver. I ordered 2 chicken bowls and 1 shrimp bowl. The chicken bowl orders were correct but the shrimp bowl was missing broccoli. I called the restaurant and the guy who picked up said he was the one who made the order and he was sure he put broccoli. Ok. Am I lying? Am I blind to broccoli? So I told him no there is none. He kept saying he was sure. Then he asked if I wanted to pick up broccoli. I ordered for delivery so why should I have to go and pick it up?! Then he said he knows he put broccoli in and to just take it up with grubhub since I didn't order with him. So rude. Also the food was way too salty and for 8 dollars you only get 4 shrimps. Crappy portions."}
{"text":"Back to back with this place, I can't stop!! I got a buffalo chicken panini first, this time a steak panini. I got it with avocado, chips, drink, and a grilled cheese, all for $11!!!! If you love veggies, come here. If you are trying to get into eating healthier, come here."}
{"text":"I have been to both of these restaurants and I need to go back, their food is amazing, fresh, and the display of vegetables makes you want to go vegetarian. I prefer the buffalo chicken panini, with avocado and tomato, you can't beat it!!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect. The staff is always so friendly and look like they actually want to be there. Food always looks fresh and tastes amazing! We go to the location across from the fiesta mall all of the time and it's so clean. Whenever we don't feel like cooking but want a place that has REAL food, we go here and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Fabulous! We stopped in for lunch. I got the Greek salad, crisp and fresh and I cud substitute out olives for something else:) big, I only was able to eat 1/2. hubby had the chicken hot bowl with Thai green chili, spices, but just the right heat. Place is clean, simple, kind of like a subway sandwich concept, excellent and friendly customer service."}
{"text":"First time at Fresh Millions 5/5/17 and we had a stir fry bowl and the chicken avocado panini . The place was bustling on a friday evening.
Both dishes were good but i have a few observations.
The stir fry bowl was cooked too long.
To a point where very few veggies were recognizable. Good taste but not a fresh looking stir fry.
I'll also ask that my panini be actually toasted next time. It seems their machine heats the bread but short of toasting the outside.
We'll try Fresh millions again and thanks for the BOGO coupon!

6/17-  just tried the philly cheese steak paninin....pretty tastey!!

2/18 - just tried the southwest chicken wrap.....large portionvand much better than i expected!!"}
{"text":"Great service and even better food! I've been coming here at least once a week if not more! The staff is super friendly and always remembers my friend and I ."}
{"text":"We tried Fresh Millions for the first time early this evening after holding onto their mail ad page for a while, and it met my expectations. The food was good - on par with the better \"rice bowl\" eateries. The choices are what make it stand apart. Think \"part Subway, part Mongolian Grill\". You pick your protein, your carb (rice, noodles, etc.), your sauce and 4 veggies, and they cook them up for you. 

As for us, I found the sauce makes the dish. We got 3 different bowls: Teriyaki, Sweet and Spicy and Sesame Soy and Chili. The Teriyaki (not spicy) and Sweet and Spicy (moderately spicy) were tasty and had good amounts of flavor. The Sesame Soy and Chili (mildly spicy) had a pleasant but very, very light body and flavor. My wife, who almost never adds salt at the table, got up and got the salt. Beyond that, all the ingredients were satisfactory or better. I read that one reviewer's veggies were overcooked but ours were  properly stir-fried and crunchy. They also serve salads (of which we got what turned out to be a very plain Caesar) and Paninis (didn't try). 

Perhaps it's a bit picky, but the place could stand a less stark decor - with the plain white walls with stock photos of entrees and the white tile and stainless steel counter, it looks like a budget enterprise. Warmer paint at least would make it look less cafeteria-like. Hopefully they'll do well enough to update sometime.

All in all, I'd repeat because I'm looking for more of the healthy bend on fast food, if not just to try the variety of combinations."}
{"text":"Fresh and clean eating! The hot bowls are delicious. Green curry was spot on. Generously sized salads. The panini was on decent bread, but a little bland.  Prices are reasonable and the $8 for $20 deal is well worth the try!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place to grab some fairly healthy lunches.  Some salad combos, and wraps looked good.  I had the chicken and avocado panini and it was ok but not great, mostly due to the bread.  Not bad enough to drag my whole score down though since the other choices looked good"}
{"text":"We placed our order through uber eats, and the first time we ordered it was cancelled and we didn't realize it for 45 minutes. Then we ordered a second time and none of the orders came with the sauce we asked for. 
We spent $33, and would like to be contacted about this if you want this review changed. If you still see this review it means they never followed up either!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Little hidden gem near on the opposite side of the mall. If you looking for a healthy option this is the place. Super clean and tasty. The Hot Bowl are awesome !! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Lives up to its name everything is sooooooo fresh! The guy that helped us was friendly and even let us taste the different sauces they have to offer.  Their food is very tasty! And they deliver! We would definitely try this place again, and again."}
{"text":"I loved it. It's a great place for a really good, filling, fresh meal. I got the shrimp bowl, with soy/chili sauce, noodles, cucumbers, celery, bean sprouts, and cabbage. I would get this again with a different sauce (was a little too spicy for my tolerance level) and ask the veggies not to be sautéed (I just personally prefer uncooked veggies)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I have so many good things to say about it. First of all, the $8 for $20 is a great deal. The hot bowls are amazing and they are big! They are not skimpy with the ingredients. I also tried a side salad and it was great too! Even without a coupon the food is very reasonably priced. I also want to mention how clean they are. I love that! The whole time we were there they were cleaning and switching out containers and that makes you feel good about eating there. Even when I asked for a to go lid the employee put a glove on before he grabbed it. I was pretty impressed! I will be back, maybe even tomorrow lol :)"}
{"text":"The food is definitely fresh, the place is super clean, great service, nice size portions.  It's just kinda boring for $6."}
{"text":"The food here is good, everyone is nice, and they can get you done quick. 
Srs tho guys if you want more in-house traffic you gotta warm up the decor of your inside. Get some better chairs and tables."}
{"text":"Very good, fresh, plentiful salads at a very reasonable price. Got a Cobb and mandarin salad and both were very good."}
{"text":"Had teriyaki chicken bowl it's so dry and tasteless 
They boiled the chicken before hand and just pour the sauce over it and the terryaki sauce is a little bit tangy ( suppose to be sweet not tangy ) 
I am going back to Yogis or the teriyaki place in fiesta mall !!! For better dish and lesser price
Good luck fresh million specially on the location you chose !"}
{"text":"The service was attentive and the food is delicious !
What a refreshing option instead of fast food . I had the chicken hot bowl ! I will be back ."}
{"text":"Fast, healthy, good prices!

Food:
They have various hot bowls, panini, and wraps - but I've settled on their salads. Tonight I had the Chicken Cobb Salad and it was delightful! Previously I've had the Buffalo Chicken Salad and Design Your Own Salad, and they've all been quite good!

Cost:
$8.64, tax included, seems like a decent value. And unlike my first visit many months ago, the portion sizes have been generous - no complaints.

Service: 
Staff is friendly and helpful, and I never have to wait long for my food.

Atmosphere:
Well, it's clean. But it's very unassuming, much like the Subway next door.

Overall:
I like the variety, and everything so far has been fresh and good."}
{"text":"I would have never found this restaurant or even have came in because of its name. But my brother asked me to come since he had a Groupon to feed two people. So why not?! They have great reviews on Yelp. It was our first time in, and we were both overwhelmed from the options. Good thing they were patient with us, and explained the process. I ended up ordering a hot bowl: paneer, noodles, thai peanut sauce, corn, mushrooms, squash, bacon bits, avocado, & cilantro. We had $20 to spend so we splurged on avocado and bacon bits and glad we did, the bacon was flavorful with my noodles! I've had better paneer but the Thai peanut sauce is pretty good, and I would definitely come back since it's close to Pokitrition, where I work! Hot bowls are $7.95 super affordable. I'll probably ask for less sauce the next time I come in, mine was a bit saucy for my taste."}
{"text":"Holy SPICY, Batman! My family and I decided to call in an order yesterday. I got the chicken hot bowl with noodles and Szechuan sauce....and couldn't wait to eat its yumminess!! After the first bite my tastebuds were screaming and my mouth was on fire...! So painfully spicy I couldn't eat it.  Husband ordered the steak panini which was good. My son ordered the chicken nuggets which tasted like they were defrosted recently. All in all I'd try it again but I'll stay far away from the spicy sauces."}
{"text":"Very nice place. I work next door so come here a lot. I have had most of the items on menu and they all taste wonderful. They are putting more items on the menu soon as well! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!!  We had a Chinese salad. A steak panini and a chicken noodle bowl. All were really good. Definitely going back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Lots of great options here! I got the hot chicken bowl and it was really tasty. The service is fast and friendly. We will be back."}
{"text":"This was absolutely delicious. I ordered a wrap & mandarin orange chicken salad. It was so tasty and so fresh! I am pregnant and this really hit the spot! It was delivery and wasn't soggy or gross at all. I could tell it was sent out immediately after they made it. I'll definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Cleanest restaurant I have ever been in! A great selection of veggies to select from. This is the format I would have if I had a \"build your bowl restaurant\". This is the type of place we go to Yelp to find. Great service, really good food at very reasonable prices and interesting people to talk to. This is at the top of our return list for sure. Music was a little loud for our hearing aides, but most places are."}
{"text":"Great tasting, completely customizable bowls to cater to any mood. I got the shrimp and chicken with Thai peanut sauce and a handful of veggies. It was full of flavor and filled me up. My kid got the chicken nuggets and even those were great quality."}
{"text":"Great customer service. First visit and was walked through the process step by step. Great tasting food. Will be back."}
{"text":"This place is great! I love the Hot BOWLS! You can pick up to 4 ingredients for your bowls, and only .50 cent for each extra item. THE BEST PART was when I logged on Yelp, and this site, I got a GREAT DEAL too! (Pay $8 & Get $20 worth! Woohoo!"}
{"text":"The delivery hours are only after 4. The set up is similar to Chipotle but with more options. The panini's ingredients aren't listed. I got the steak panini which had a lot of peppers in it but it was a good size for the price. I also tried the Chicken with the  noodle base a few toppings then I had them add egg. It was really good but I wish there was less noodles and more veggies"}
{"text":"Visiting from So Cal... nice friendly local place with decent food. Quick, easy, and the $8 deal can't be beat! Thanks for a good lunch! I had hot chicken bowl with sweet and spicy sauce, yum!"}
{"text":"We were looking for something healthy to eat before hitting the grocery store and my fiancé found this place. I was surprised by the menu options and personally love the hot bowls, it's something I would make at home and can see that the veggies are all fresh. The service was quick, prices are great too! Food came out hot and cooked perfectly within 10 minutes. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"For a quick Sunday bite this place isn't too shabby. My dad and brother got the steak panini. I got the chicken avocado panini. My sister had gotten the veggie panini. I tried some of the steak panini and it was much better tasting than the chicken avocado. My panini was definitely lacking flavor, I could've made a better panini at home. My sister said her veggie panini was also lacking flavor. It took quite a while for our food to come out too. 

The serving sizes are definitely awesome. I was full after eating only half my panini! The customer service was good. The girl at the front was very nice!

Will I be back? Probably not!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. You can select what needs to be added food you eat. It has a kind of open kitchen so you can be see your food being cooked right in front of you. I am particular that my food doesn't touch meat and seeing my food being cook fresh in front of you is big plus. Also the food is served steaming hot right out of stove. 

The only minus is hot food is served on plastic bowl, it would be good if they use China bowls."}
{"text":"Super good! Came here on a trip with my fiance. We ordered and split a chicken wrap and steak panini. They were delicious! I highly recommend Fresh Millions. Wish we had one at home. Why would you go to Subway? When this place is an option?"}
{"text":"The food is delicious with fresh vegetables and vegetarian option. I got the half and half hot bowl and serving size is generous enough for me to have the leftovers for lunch. The schezuan sauce is spicy but that's what I was looking for."}
{"text":"The service was friendly.  It was nice they offered a coupon deal on Yelp.  It's good for quick lunch.  Nothing bad to say but nothing really great to say either."}
{"text":"First off, if you haven't tried it they have an awesome deal through yelp. All of the ingredients are right in front of you like Subway however they use quality ingredients and you can taste the difference. I was surprised they had different types of curry and how good it tasted however their biggest asset is there employees. Five-star customer service. I will be back for more"}
{"text":"First time here today. Wasn't sure what to expect but the nice young man explained how it works. 

In our cafeteria at work we have a similar set up for the hot bowls so it made it easier for me to choose.

For the hot bowls you choose one base (noodles, white rice, bwn rice, pasta, spinach, romaine)

Then you choose four veggies, one protein and a sauce.

I got white rice, chicken, red bell peppers, zucchini, mushrooms, broccoli. Teriyaki sauce.

It was very good and filling. 

You can also get Panini's, salads and wraps. 

For a limited time, just about everything is $6 so now is a good time to try them out."}
{"text":"2.5 stars, but not for lack of tastiness.

Met aunt and her grand-daughter-in-law (?) here for a late dinner.  (Eating at 9:30 pm is WAY too late for me, but I haven't seen my aunt in ages, plus I'd just left a very fun and delicious chocolate Yelp event that had gone an hour past the event end time, so I justified my eating late by meeting family at a veggie-friendly place!)  Aunt told me that her relative w/ gluten-free dining restrictions would be joining us, so I had them choose between Fresh Millions and Thailicious-- the young woman chose FM.  

My food was already on the table by the time I'd arrived, since they'd arrived at the restaurant ten minutes before closing, and I was still on my way from N. Scottsdale; My aunt relayed my phone order to the cashier.  If you're looking for atmosphere, you won't find it here.  FM shares a corner lot with Subway, and it seems that it was designed by the same architect/company.  I wouldn't be surprised if someone told me that it is a sister company of Subway.  I hope it isn't, as I DISLIKE everything Subway offers (artificial ingredients in their \"breads,\" GMO-everything, as well as corn syrup in their dressings, which are used in their salads and sandwiches).  

I can see why FM is popular, especially among those of us who have diet restrictions, for there are so many ways to custom-order your food!  I chose a hot bowl, which comes with your choice of:

1. Protein- chicken, steak, shrimp, bacon, two eggs, tofu, or veggie

2. Sauce- Gluten-free options (Alfredo, basil pesto, chipotle southwest, Szechuan, & Thai peanut) and teriyaki, sweet & spicy, sesame soy & chili, Thai green curry, & tikka masala

3. Base- Brown or white rice, noodles, pasta, Romaine, spinach, or half & half of two bases

4. Four regular- as opposed to premium, which I assume cost more- mix-ins from a list of thirty-one (yes, 31!) ingredients

My steak hot bowl, with fusilli pasta and spinach bases, basil pesto sauce, and water chestnuts, bean sprouts, broccoli, and black beans, was hot, fresh, and tasty! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fresh-millions-restaurant-chandler?select=tlJsqwFf3CMbkvsS7awPkw  I couldn't stop eating it.  However, I won't be ordering from Fresh Millions again, because something in this dish made my lips, tongue, and the insides of my mouth itchy!  Allergic reaction, but from which ingredient?  It may have been the water chestnuts, which I'm still experimenting with to see if I'm allergic, or perhaps one, or more ingredients weren't washed as clean as they could've been, the sauce ingredients, or just from all the pesticides that GMO products contain.  Eat here if you aren't sensitive to pesticides and GMO products, or if you don't mind suffering from food allergies.  I know which foods I'm willing to suffer for a day, or three, and which aren't worth the pain.  (Believe me, once you listen to what your body tells you, you will feel, look, and think better!)

Cool dining option for those who do not have food allergies, as there are also salads, wraps, and sandwiches you may customize and have fun with.  I liked the fact that the food are placed in reusable plastic containers and NOT styrofoam!  That's a plus worthy of 3 stars."}
{"text":"This new place rocks! I am already addicted to the pesto sauce!! The folks are super helpful and very nice! The food is fresh! My friend got a panini and it looks amazing! I cannot say enough! I wish I could give them more stars!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp, excellent place, super fresh and plenty of choices. Our part had 2 hot bowls ,and 1 salad.  The salad looked great. I had a hot bowls, it was so good. Try it is great and fresh, vegan options too."}
{"text":"We just ordered delivery from here...all I can say is Blah. It was hot and on time, but it just didn't have any flavor. I ordered the hot beef bowl with tikka masala and my husband ordered the hot chicken bowl with Thai peanut sauce. Neither sauce tasted like anything. I was hoping to find a healthy and fresh place that delivered, but unfortunately we won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This place is only 10 minutes away from my mom's house, and I'm so glad because it's very convenient. Even when it's busy, the line moves pretty quickly as they were efficient at getting through customers. Perfect for lunch on the go! The salad ingredients are fresh and tasty. Despite it being busy, they took the time to customize any dishes based on requests. I'm a vegetarian, so this was perfect. I ordered a bowl here, and a salad to go. Oh, and the prices were extremely reasonable. I'd come back here in a heartbeat and would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious! Fresh ingredients made for a very enjoyable Hot Bowl. So many choices and possible combinations. I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"I have frequented this place since they opened and have been a loyal customer.  They are friendly and have fresh options. 
I always get the hot bowl but wish they would go heavier on the veggies and meats. I always get 2x meat because there isn't quite enough. The tikka masala or Thai green curry sauce are my favorites. The problem is, even if you ask for extra salt they are so bland that you have to add salt to practically every bite. Would be nice if they had salt packets to go. That's my only complaint. 

Give it a try. I think it takes most people 2 or 3 visits to really get the hang of it and figure out how best to order."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch and got the southwest chicken wrap. It was delicious, friendly staff and quick service. Will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Fresh and quick stir fry. You get to choose your meat, sauce then 4 add ins. I love the garlic chili with chicken. Then I can customize to make it without rice since I am watching those  carbs. I've heard that the wraps are great, but haven't ventured into them."}
{"text":"Paninis, soups, and salads, oh my! Follow the Fresh Million Road (Well, Chandler Blvd actually) to this little restaurant that offers healthier alternatives to burgers and fries. Everything is fresh and made on the spot for you, for reasonable prices.

I had a chicken tikka masala panini ($6) with a Caesar side salad ($1.80). I got the order to go, and it didn't take too long to be made. I was out the door in no time.

The sandwich had a crisp outer grilled crust, with fluffy, light tasting bread. There were big chunks of chicken breast in it, and the sauce was like the memory of chicken tikka masala sauce, a milder version rather than the bold spicy tomato-y cream sauce I'm typically used to. The salad was refreshing and crisp, and the dressing was flavorful.

Service was friendly. I'll come here again for tasty and quick meals if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Loved it! Had the hot steak bowl with a bed of half pasta/half spinach (my choice from many bases), 4 fresh veggies (I chose double red peppers, baby corn, brocolli and the spicy sauce. It was so fresh and colorful and I could it it daily! Awesome $6 grand opening special! Order it like fast food but healthy and flavorful. My new fave!"}
{"text":"Very good, clean place. Nice tables! Great food! I had a buffalo chicken panini and it was awesome and a house salad with butter herb dressing. Everyone was so nice."}
{"text":"Amother great meal here, fresh food, very nice employees as well. Try it, you'll like it !!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful staff !!!! Pick what you want and the food is awesome and short money.....Fresh ingredients and huge assortment. Will definitely be back soon. 2 bowls and a wrap.....yummy !!! Leave them a tip....they earn it!"}
{"text":"Grand opening for this location-- they are having some great specials going on. What can I say? I came twice in two days. The food is really great, and very fresh. My personal favorites are the hot bowls--the tikka masala and green curry are my favorite sauces.  Basically, you choose your meat (chicken, steak, tofu*, etc), choose a base (white rice, brown rice, spinach, etc), choose a sauce, and then choose your add-ins (mostly veggies but they also have bacon and different cheeses).  Then, they take it all back to a wok, mix it together and sauté it. It's ready just a few minutes later, piping hot and delicious!  They also have kids dishes and salads.  A great lunch place or quick dinner.  Definitely will be coming back.

*tofu is not a meat"}
{"text":"To be honest I got a tofu bowl with the peanut sauce and it was okay. A meat option probably would have been better. Though I bought a chicken quesadilla for my daughter that she didn't end up eating and snuck a slice, it's was great! I don't know what sauce they put on the quesadilla but I loved it and it wasn't small either. I plan on visiting again to try a wrap soon."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place so many times and thought that I should give it a try. I did just that this week and was left wondering why I waited so long!

They offer a nice assortment of options: salads, bowls, wraps, and paninis. I went with the Steak Bowl on white rice. You get to pick up to 4 fresh veggies to include in the bowl. Seriously, these bowls are so good! It's a lot of food for a decent price (under $9) and, better yet, it's healthy!

This is quickly becoming one of my \"go-to\" places for quick and healthy food!"}
{"text":"We went to this place because they have a sweet groupon deal that makes it cheaper to eat here than to make our own dinners. Which is always great. The food is great! I haven't gotten anything I haven't liked here. The service is awesome, the people are great. The weird thing about Fresh Millions is that it feels like sitting in an under budgeted movie where they couldn't get the rights to whichever restaurant they wanted to use. It's just kind of a blank place. 
Again, foods really good. The staff is awesome. It's just a weird little place."}
{"text":"Very nice clean appearance. Very welcoming. My friends & I ordered the chicken hot bowls with the sweet & spicy sauce. They were a little stingy on the vegetables in my opinion. Great sauce! I would return here for lunch, but not for dinner since we all left a little hungry."}
{"text":"Tried this place, because I've seen them popping up everywhere. Really pleased with it. The food is really fresh and the noodles r very good. It's a great quick healthier place to go. Got the chicken bowl and buffalo chicken panini. Check in on yelp and get a great deal. I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Food here is so BOMB! Very good! We will be back! Wish they stayed open a little later. Great customer service &I a very clean place!"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS!! Ordered meal vua Door Dash, Fresh Millions TOTALLY LET ME DOWN!!! The Beef Hot Bowl was  so thick with noodles I could barely make out any other ingredients! I ordered 1/2 noodles, 1/2 spinch! Beef was probably 1 Tablespoon of Ground Beef, 1 slice of mushroom visible, 4 spinach leaves ( I requested 1/2 noodles, 1/2 spinach), 3 bean sprouts, no onions and hardly any Teriyaki sauce. NEVER AGAIN Fresh Millions!!!! You lost a BIG fan tonite!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying it, after having the Steak Panini, I had to say it was really good but was still kind of hesitant to go back. But today, trying it for the second time I have got to say this is going to be my new go-to lunch spot for something quick and on the go. Environment is more take-out rather than sit down, but the food is good. Great place for something quick and fresh!"}
{"text":"Had the shrimp bowl. I'd say it was just ok. Skimpy with the toppings. Glad I didn't pay full price.

There are some toppings that they say are \"extra charge\" but nowhere can you find out how much they cost.

Friendly staff. Just don't see how this place makes it. You get MUCH more meat and food for the same price at Chipotle."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, and tasty. Awesome, friendly and knowledgeable staff. Numerous selections and options of food choices."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Fresh Millions so I was not familiar with the way they do things. They don't allow customers to create their own salad but rather have to select one of theirs and can only switch out the ingredients you don't want from their salad with what you want. So if a salad on the menu comes with tomatoes and cheese but you don't want those then they'll substitute those two ingredients but if you want more greens (anything in the salad bar) then they'll charge you $0.50 per ingredient. That adds up since most of their salads only have three greens. That's not much if you want a salad for a meal and not an appetizer or side. I added shrimp (four grilled shrimp for $1.50) which were good but the bulk of my salad was lettuce (see photos). 

And they don't chop or cut everything small enough to put in your mouth without cutting it with a knife. I felt like I wasted $10 because my salad was mostly lettuce. They do nickel and dime you which is a turn off. I prefer to create my own salad with as many veg as I want without it costing more than $10 like they do it at Salata. Not a huge variety in the salad bar but it was decent quality (not wilted and tastes good). 

The bowls are probably the thing to get here not the salad if you want a meal. The bowls looked good so next time I'll try one of those but not at this location. I felt the customer service and friendliness was lacking and I found it difficult to understand what was being said to me because the woman was soft spoken."}
{"text":"The food is ok. The quality of the ingredients is obviously not the highest, but not horrible. The meal was ok, not great and not bad, just mediocre. Certainly nothing special that would make me want to come back.

However we will not be back. During our half hour of sitting in the restaurant every single checkout that a customer had was an ordeal where they were trying to nickel and dime them. The restaurant is clearly penny wise and dollar poor, and I don't suspect that they will survive. I have great doubts that any customer who came will be back based on their universal negative experience with the employees, wanting to charge extra for a sauce or a pinch of cilantro. 

At the time we went there are all kinds of promotions to try to generate traffic including Groupon and yelp 50%+ discounts. With good customer service and an atmosphere that doesn't feel cheap and nickel-and-dime for every little thing we would be back, and I'm sure many others would be too. However, I'm pretty sure that Millions will shortly be out of business, and that's sad because it's a good idea."}
{"text":"So went to use a groupon and not one person spoke English. Not a problem if I am going to. mexican food joint but since this is 'new American' was a bit taken aback.  Took 10 minutes to order 2 salads and one was wrong. Even after they pulled the menu to figure out ingredients. Will try again another time another location."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying this place and i was surprised at how good it was. They have a check-in offer which i didn't see until after i paid for my order. I got the avacado chicken panini since it seemed to be the least complicated thing on the menu. The bread could have been more thinner and crispier but that was a minor detail. The avacado was fresh and cut right in front of me. I'd come back again and this time I'd use the check-in offer."}
{"text":"New to the Gilbert area this place has lots of dinner options.. bowls, salads, paninis, wraps with tons of different topping options. 

On today's visit I picked up chicken & steak bowls ., the steak bowl had tender meat with mushroom, bell pepper & green peas served over brown bowl with a spicy Szechuan sauce.. very good!!

You pick the base, protein, 4 fresh veggies and a sauce.. I haven't made my way through the entire menu yet but I will.

Friendly staff, lots of seating.. reasonably priced. Check it out you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"While looking through yelp for a quick, healthy, inexpensive spot that I have not yet been to..I came across Fresh Millions. Yelp had a deal for $8 for $20 and I couldn't resist the offer...and let me tell you it was wel l worth it! For UNDER $20 two people can eat a full, healthy delicious meal including beverages and desert. 

I had the avocado chicken panini which came in a delicious bread with all fresh ingredients. My buddy dining with me for a bowl which is completely customizable with fresh veggies your choice of base (rice, salad, or a combo of 2)and meat. I was so jealous after trying their bowl..I wanted to go up to the counter and get my own even though I was full off my sandwich! 

I would definitely recommend this place to anybody. Super spot to hit post workout. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I walked in to a calm but clean establishment. The customer flow was steady while I was there. The owner  (I think it was the owner) was doing paperwork at a table but made sure that the counter person served me right away. I ordered a beef hot bowl but couldn't decide on my choice of base so I asked if I could have half of two, the noodles and spinach. They obliged. On top of that you get four other add ins (+. 50 for each additional). Then you choose which sauce you want it cooked in. I chose the sweet and spicy.They served it up fresh and quickly. It was a little light on the beef but still really good. The bowls are usually $7.95 but for the Grand opening they are $6. Cha-ching! Great food and a great price! I'll be back"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Fresh, real food at a reasonable price. The staff is friendly as well. Great place for lunch! I've had the BBQ Chicken salad and the grilled chicken, avacado panini so far. Both were excellent. The panini is huge for the price. I got mine with reg mayo instead of chipoltle mayo. Yum!"}
{"text":"Just as good as the Chandler location. I've never been disappointed.  Grilled chicken/avocado panini is my favorite. Gilbert next, please! :)"}
{"text":"Really digging this place. Great service, easygoing atmosphere, and good food. GF and I go to lunch here and have become well versed with their menu. Fave is the chicken hot bowl with Szechuan sauce and the 4 veggies. only complaint...no Coke Zero!"}
{"text":"LOVE Fresh Millions! I've been eating at the Mesa location at least once a week while I am at work. Super excited to have the Gilbert location right down the street from home. 
Fresh ingredients, clean restaurant and SUPER friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Had a yelp deal for this place. Cute concept and fresh
.. Minus the salad. Nothing spectacular  but fresh and easy and cheap."}
{"text":"Solid food and great customer service. Food was reasonably priced and food was extremely fresh. I like highly recommend this to anyone. They have many varieties you can choose from from wraps to bowls to salads."}
{"text":"We love this place! If you're looking for quick, healthy, fresh, AND inexpensive, you might think you're dreaming. But you're not, Fresh Millions meets all these requirements and their food is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I'm all over Phoenix as you can tell from my posts. I'm always trying to find new spots so I can recommend to friends, family and coworkers. This is one of my favorite lunch spots, not just for the food but for the service. This place has been open for a while now and I remember walking in when it just opened. Not sure of what to order, I decided to go with the chicken bowl with veggies and sweet /spicy sauce. 

When you walk up to order they ask you to choose a meat, four veggies, noodles or rice and a sauce. They have a great variety of sauces and veggies. Other than bowls they also offer wraps, paninis and much more. If you are in the area give this place a try it's very good."}
{"text":"Had this place for dinner tonight, and it was great!!! The buffalo chicken panini is the best ever by far!  The hot bowls menu option is a great way to get what you want.  My mom loved her choice, and the cesar salad was super fresh and delicious!  We had it delivered, it came in a very timely fashion and the delivery driver was a delight!  This will become a favorite at home and at work!"}
{"text":"Not getting the hype here. One of the main problems is that you can't actually build your own salad. You can only switch out options on their pre made ones. The food itself was just ok and for the price I would look elsewhere. The other issue I had here was how rude the staff was. I was using the $8 for $20 deal from Yelp and as soon as I mentioned it the employee starting saying that I could not use it for take out. I had never intended to use it for take out and let her know that. She kept asking \"are you sure?\" and I kept telling her that I was in fact eating there. I felt very attacked and when I had some leftovers for my salad that I ate in the restaurant she rolled her eyes as she handed me a box. Not sure what I did to deserve that treatment but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This was the only 5 star in my area so we thought we would give it a shot.  Pretty awesome food.  Great staff.  Cong back for a well deserved 5 star again!"}
{"text":"Great flavors, fresh veggies and tastes wonderful. My order was a little short on veggies, but my friend had a lot. Still worth it."}
{"text":"I love the hot bowl !! Great customer service ! Super sweet i will definitely come back again !"}
{"text":"So so yummy! I promise. I got the shrimp hot bowl with red and green onions and sweet n spicy sauce. So hot and delicious. I also tried the chicken tiki panini which was hot and amazing!"}
{"text":"Great, fast, friendly service. The gentlemen working the front counter was happy to help my girlfriend and I with suggestions. The food came out quickly. We got a steak bowl and a chicken bowl. I would recommend coming here for lunch or dinner. The serving sizes are great for the price. We will be back."}
{"text":"Just ate there for lunch.  They have very fresh food - build your own.  I had a bowl with noodles, chicken and the toppings.  It was excellent!  Staff was very courteous and helpful as a first-timer.    I will be back!

It is nice to find healthy alternatives and close to where I work!!

Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Fast, fresh and healthy! This is my sec d time and I cannot stress how fast and fresh as well as tasty that everything is!"}
{"text":"Fresh fresh and fresh! Love how they make the salads fresh and right in front of you. Price is right. Love the mandarin chicken salad and southwest. Kids menu is above reasonable!"}
{"text":"We love their menu! Healthy customizable options! The staff is always friendly. 

Has become an after practice go to quick stop for us!"}
{"text":"My coworker tricked me to an extent as we put in about 3 miles of walking during the day. Decided to walk and ended up here as part of the walk. I was looking for a healthy option for lunch (new me I guess for 2017 :-). Saw a few things on the outdoor sign that peaked our interest so let's order!!!

I wanted something hot and the 1st thing that jumped out to me was the Shrimp & Avocado Panini. I complimented it with a simple side salad. The one thing I like were all the fresh ingredients and the ability to actually \"SEE\" it all directly in front of me. The selection was great but a bit overwhelming as a lot of the menu items have a \"specific\" set of ingredients and I'm one who likes to deviate my orders... Adding avocado to the salad was extra $ but if looked good. 

The bread for the Panini's is \"thick\" so from a carb perspective, watch out as the focaccia bread  was filling. Speaking of fillings, I think the amount of shrimp, avocado & other ingredients were good, but didn't match the size of the bread. Still good but lack a flavor punch that I think I was expecting due to other Panini experiences. 

Coworker had the salad wrap and it was pretty decent in size. Plan to make a few more trips over the coming weeks to diversify my choices but it makes the cut for lunch for me."}
{"text":"We found a yelp deal for fresh millions and decided to give it a try. The concept is that of Chipotle but for noodles, salads, and  sandwiches. Going inside the restaurant was clean and not a long wait. We ordered 3 hot bowls, chicken, tofu, and shrimp with noodles. You get to pick your sauce and veggie mix ins. We got our food fast and it was warm. 

The portion was good but mine had only 4 pieces of shrimp, the tofu bowl had very little tofu, the chicken was ok. The sauces all tasted the same so I wasn't sure the difference. Also the mix ins from other peoples bowls gets in yours. The tofu bowl had a piece of chicken and mine had some onions and we didn't choose those. 

The place was ok for the deal. The servers were nice however it just wasnt somewhere I would choose to go again for the money."}
{"text":"So I have resisted this place for a while, when I see healthy in a title I usually think no flavor. I was wrong, for starters the place is immaculate. Part of that is that it is new, the other part is that the crew seems to really care. All though it's a fast food kinda place they bring your food out to your table and check into make sure you like everything. We got two hot bowls one with rice chicken sweet and sour sauce and carrots baby corn mushrooms and pineapple, the other was noodle Szechuan sauce steak broccoli carrots water chestnuts and mushrooms. The sweet and sour bowl won with out a doubt. I spent most of my time stealing bites from my son. The other was good but lacked in flavor, mostly I tasted a little heat and not much else. I'm going to take it home and doctor it up because the base is good, it just needs a bit of help. I would recommend this place. The deals going right now are great, and that sweet and sour bowl is worth a return trip!"}
{"text":"5 stars all around! My hubby and I rarely agree on a place to eat but fresh millions is the one thing we both can agree on! We come to this location all the time.. a little out of our way but it's worth the drive! What I love about fresh millions is that it's your own creation. You can make your meal based off of what you like, and the options are endless. You can literally make a million combinations. 
They have salads, paninis, wraps, and more.
I get the chicken hot bowl, half rice and noodles with the basil pesto sauce and with the 4 ingredients to add to it, it fills me up and allows me to take the rest home. So A+ on the portion sizes and customer service is awesome!!"}
{"text":"The food is great. The staff doesn't really speak English, so if you have any questions, you don't get far. I've been here three times and every time I ask anything, whoever is working just smiles and nods. It's frustrating to ask about ingredients. If they could hire an English speaker to work the counter, I would be much happier!"}
{"text":"Friendly, helpful staff. Customizable menu. Good food. We had the chicken and shrimp
Bowls with teriyaki and Thai peanut sauce. They give you plenty of sauce unlike a lot of other places!"}
{"text":"Fresh Millions was pretty mediocre. My family and I tried four different dishes, none of which blew us away or stood as competition to the dishes of restaurants that actually specialize in the dishes. The ambiance is just plain white walls and the employees seemed like they would rather be somewhere else. Wasn't completely terrible, but not unique either."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  Pick a protein , a carb, ( or no carb) a sauce and 4 toppings. They cook it up fresh to order.  They have bowls, wraps as big as your head, and salads.  So delish and fresh!  And lots to chose from."}
{"text":"Really great food and the delivery was quick too. Got my order in about 30 mins. Everything was accurate and totally fresh. Definitely going to become a regular here."}
{"text":"Lots of healthy choices. One can never get tired of eating here. Good place for kids to get their veggies. This company has restaurants in other states and I have tried them. Excellent customer service and real tasty food . Will definitely go back for more ."}
{"text":"Great staff, good prices, food was delicious and quick. Everything was very clean and I will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"Awesomely friendly staff, fresh and great delicious food, cozy and relaxing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great concept! We tried this place for the first time tonight. When we walked in, we weren't really sure what to do, but the gentlemen behind the counter were very helpful and attentive in walking us through the process. Our food was served quickly; we had hot bowls, and they were very hot, and very good. Portions are large for the price. Great deal. We will be back."}
{"text":"Think Chipotle for everything.  The options are endless.  Without yelp, I would have never stopped in here. The food was ok, but my kid really enjoyed the tricolor pasta with alfredo sauce and broccoli."}
{"text":"Their food is as good as you are at your choices. Loved my visit there, the staff were pleasant."}
{"text":"Everything was spotless! The vegtables are so fresh and everything is so clean. I'm not kidding, this place is immaculate. My husband and I enjoyed our visit and the food came out quick. It was hot and delicious! My sons quesadilla was 100% amazing. It was literally the best quesadilla I have ever had. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Awesome Place ... Just go try it !!!  Super FRESH choices sandwiches are great and there Bowles are unbelievable you chose everything! How can you go wrong!!  People here are very nice and help you with everything."}
{"text":"It's OK. The flavors are all a little bit weird and the things just don't tend to go very well.

The noodles taste far from fresh and the salad dressings are all very bland.

This is a chain from N California and it's just pretty average. The food looks way more amazing than it was. Unfortunately."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE ROOOOOCKS, the food was so good and it came out quickly! The prices aren't bad either! I didn't feel like crap after eating which was nice especially since my lunch break usually consists of fries and regret. Try this place now:))))"}
{"text":"I love the shrimp and avocado sandwich and add on a garden side salad with mandarin oranges. Great bowls too and you can make just how you want it."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my bowl. I had steak and noodles with veggies. It was tasty and didn't Seem overpriced. Wide variety of options."}
{"text":"At first glace the menu seems intimidating however just dive in like the instructions say. Protein, sauce, and choose 4 veggies. All fresh ingredients. I ordered chicken with green curry and a few veggies. Could have used a little more spice but overall an interesting concept for fresh food fast."}
{"text":"I visited fresh millions twice for salads. I tried the signature salad the first time and Cobb the second. I didn't get a chance to take a picture because both times I was so hungry after my workout and the salads are way too delicious. This place is clean and the employees are helpful. Return factor is high."}
{"text":"Seemed to be striving to be customer oriented. The only hard part is all the choices. Really enjoyed the Thai Green with steak. Only criticism was the protein portion was less than proportionate. It seemed to be the same portion as a single side topping. Still tastes good and
feels good after, unlike fast food."}
{"text":"Eh... nothing special.  Pretty plain and not too exciting."}
{"text":"The reason my son and I chose to eat here was because of the $8 for $20 deal offered on Yelp. Great deal, couldn't pass it up. 
It's a small place. Reminded me of subway kinda. There were a few ppl in line when we showed up. We stood back and checked out the menu. Not a very large selection, but I like it. It's simple. Either you want a hot rice/noodle bowl, salad, wrap or sandwich. The guy behind the counter was kind and helped us decide on what to get. My son and I went with the bowls. He got tofu and beef noodle bowl $7.95ish & I got a veggie brown rice bowl $6.75ish. Basically you chose a meat (chicken, beef, shrimp, or tofu) rice or noodles, a sauce and a base, and 4 toppings, additional toppings are 50cents each. They cook it up and bring it out to you. Think Mongolian grill on a much smaller scale. Definitely a good lunch stop. 
My son absolutely loved it. He's not very picky tho so. I like it because they offer heathy options. Next time I wanna try a salad. I just hate paying $8 for a salad i can make at home for waaaay cheaper."}
{"text":"...So new update I have food poisoning from this meal. Ate nothing afterwards, and how I know is because my grandson ate some.of my bowl and only he got sick, but other 2 who ate something different did not ..... do not eat here..

Meh food, steak szechaun.....
Meh customer service, didn't know ingredients of Szechuan sauce,, not good for those who need to know ,register showed 9086.00 but they told me not to worry haha..I did pay 9.86 and for a receipt. Will not go back"}
{"text":"Great food. I ordered the Steak Bowl with Thai curry! You can add the veggies of your choice. Fast service and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"3.5 stars would've seemed a little more fair to me, but we'll go with 4. I've been to Fresh Millions twice, and ordered the BBQ chicken salad both times. The salads are huge! Ingredients seem decently fresh, and the dressing is good. However, the salad was absolutely drowning in the dressing (both times)...which sort of ruins a salad in my opinion. Seems like the actual filling and toppings in their stuff are also pretty basic - just a few things, nothing fancy. Prices are okay though, so I guess it evens out. Overall, not my first choice, but I would come back and try other things."}
{"text":"This eatery is amazing! The food is delicious and I love all of the ingredients they offer. The hot bowls are my favorite. You pick a base such as rice or noodles, choose a sauce like pesto, teriyaki or sweet and sour, add a filler such as chicken or steak, and then add toppings like veggies. They put it together in a bowl, which doesn't look like much at first, but after it is cooked and ready (like 5 minutes), voila, you have great looking bowl chalk full of fresh and tasty real ingredients! The wraps are also great. The kicker is it is a great deal, very affordable. They also do salads and other things I haven't tried yet. Can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Service is top too."}
{"text":"Popped in for quick pickup to take back to office. Only 5 people ahead, 3 who were ordering. Only took about 5 minutes of waiting and worker was friendly. 

Got the shrimp hot bowl with half noodle and half brown rice in Thai green curry sauce. All bowls have 4 mix-ins and any additional is $0.50 more.  Total came to $9 and the wait was around 6-10 minutes. 

Crew was incredibly friendly and asked the right questions and patient answering questions too. The bowl was hefty and smelled heavenly!!!! 

Only disappointment was that there were only 4 shrimp in the bowl. For the cost the filler was carrots and carb. The Thai curry sauce was delicious and had a great kick!

Amex friendly"}
{"text":"The manager Sel at this location is rude and not aware of the rules of the promotions he runs. I got a check in offer from yelp but had an EXPIRED Groupon which if anyone used Groupon or is a business they will know that once the Groupon expires the promotion is OVER, the promotional value is GONE and the value is the CASH you gave to Groupon. Well Sel pleasant self refused to honor my cash in my purchase despite explaining the above to him. Bottom line - poor customer service if not rude and mediocre food"}
{"text":"Great fresh food cooked to order. So many choices, easy to come back again and again. Hot Bowls- I had the chicken with Thai Green Curry Sauce. The counter help - his name was Brian- was friendly, outgoing, quick and efficient. The Bowl was hot and generous portions. I cannot wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"This would have gotten a 3 if they hadn't cheaped out for $1.50. I had purchased a Yelp deal for $8, to get $20 worth of food before heading over to try this place for the first time. The purchase of the coupon worked flawlessly. The \"use\" of the coupon... not so much. So, since the app wouldn't open my coupon, I decided to use their \"check-in\" offer instead, which offers either a Hot Bowl, Panini or Salad for free. The guy that was originally helping me, when the coupon was not working, and I left for a moment to see if there was a # to call... was busy with someone else... so a different guy was ringing me up. I told him I would just use the check-in offer instead for the Hot Bowl. I quickly just picked one of the 3 options that were available for free with the offer. Then, the other guy comes over his shoulder and asks about the coupon... I told him it wasn't working, so I'll just use the check-in offer. He then quietly tells the guy ringing me up, to take the panini off instead of the hot bowl. In my mind, I kind of thought he was trying to give me a better offer, thinking the paninis must be worth more... then, I thought I would look, out of curiosity. Nope... he made the switch to save $1.50 for the STORE. Omg, terrible customer service! That is ridiculous. Especially when he knows I blew money on a coupon that wasn't working. He says at the end... maybe you call call them and get your money back. I guess he hopes no one uses the offer! (So why offer it?!?) 

The food was \"okay\". 
I'd be more excited if the food was organic. 

The beginning of my order was painful as well. First time, and the menu has tons of mix and match kind of options. He wasn't very helpful with making suggestions, or explaining how it all worked. 

The second guy that was ringing me up was polite, and seemed less focused on greed. But, clearly he takes orders from guy #1. He was very friendly too... he thanked us for coming at the end, and told us to have a nice day. He gets 5 stars! ;) 

... maybe since he (guy #1) likes 1's so much, I should have given him a 1 star review? 

Okay... I'll stop ;)"}
{"text":"I had shrimp hot bowl with red onion, garbanzo beans, black beans and red bell peppers along basil pesto over mixed brown & white rice. Great flavors. Staff was friendly and helpful since this was our first visit. 
We will come back again"}
{"text":"Took forever to get my Panini 'cos the 2 chefs were busy ogling the local fauna that had gathered outside. When I did get my chicken tikka masala panini, it fell apart in my hand as they had made it too soggy and had soaked right through my panini. The taste was at best meh with a tough dry chicken."}
{"text":"Customer service is too notch. The food is created from ready made goods, in a style similar to Subway. They have many options to pick from when it comes to your main dish. Offering a variety of things from hot bowl to paninis, these guys got something great going on. The only thing I'm knocking them for is the fact that they don't have the ready made ingredients covered. They leave them air exposed, which is very dangerous for cross contamination and potentially health reasons. Somebody could cough on them."}
{"text":"I had the tofu hot bowl. I really enjoyed being able to choose my own mixing for the bowl. That was really awesome and ensured I was going to line everything in it.  They were great about letting me try a few sauces so I could be sure to like it too in the bowl.  Final product....I enjoyed it.  My only disappointment was the sauce ended up being really runny which means to me it didn't \"stick\" to the noodles and vegetables.  If the sauce was a bit thicker I think it would have been great."}
{"text":"Done ordering from this place front to blame me for giving them the wrong address . A hour and a half for a delivery and when I go to ask for a manager they hang up on.  The lady I was speaking to should not be in the customer service field.  Just lost a repeat customer, sad to say is that is all it takes."}
{"text":"It is very fresh and clean, but I think there might be new owners now.  They are still nice, but they would not accept the YELP voucher when we purchased it last night before eating there.  The voucher says nothing about a minimum order and they told us we had to spend $20 to use it.  I told them the voucher did not mention this.  A little shady to me...  I do like their salads, but may search for another place to eat like it b/c their customer service did not live up to my expectations like it has in the past."}
{"text":"Thought of posting a pic after already eating some, but here are 2 versions of chicken hot bowls.

Noodles, Szechuan, broccoli, carrots, sprouts, cabbage

&

Pasta, basil pesto, sun dried tomatoes, pepperoncini, red pepper"}
{"text":"Always fresh and tasty. Very quick personal service. Great value and would highly recommend as a healthy alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon for two separate meals.  First time I chose a Caesar salad with chicken breast and sliced eggs.  Fresh and delicious!  The second time I had the steak hot bowl with my choice of veggies and sauces.  I chose the chow mein noodles.  Again, fresh and delicious.  I enjoy a burger and fries as much as anyone but you can eat happily and healthily at Fresh Millions every day.  I will return for sure.  So glad you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I wanted to really like this place but the food is not cooked while the rice was undercooked the chicken was hard and dried out"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time for a quick lunch. Yum!!! Honestly, if you can't come up with a combo you like here, it is your own fault. Lots of choices of add ins, bases, and sauces for every taste, plus proteins for meat eaters and vegs. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Now 3 stars ... turns out it somehow wasn't gluten-free. Uff, very unhappy.

Originally 5 stars ... Quick, healthy option. Very friendly for low-carb / paleo folks ... and gluten-free, which I am. My favorite parts were probably the pesto sauce and the added bacon - steep at $1.50 extra, but worth it. Great complement to a delicious veggie and chicken stir-fry!"}
{"text":"Clean place, friendly staff and lots of FRESH options. We had a tofu bowl, and a chicken Caesar salad and both were yummy!"}
{"text":"Clean place. Service was great and were very friendly.The food was excellent the only reason didn't give then 5 stars is that I asked for my Korean beef noodles minus the beef but when it arrived it had beef in it. I was in a hurry so just picked out the meat. I see myself visiting this place a lot."}
{"text":"I like that there is variety in choosing what you want in your hot bowl. the tikka massala sauce is good I would like a little more spice/flavor. This is way better than going to the fast food chains i will come back. The food isnt heavy on the stomache I can still function when I return to work."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience with Chandler, Az Location. There was a mistake with an online order. Canceling it and getting a refund was a breeze, manager was quick, helpful and concerned."}
{"text":"I am impressed. Not only is the food very fresh and awesome tasting, they actually displayed great customer service. So many places don't realize the difference good service makes.

I had the tomatoe basil soup and it was excellent. I also had the hot chicken bowl and it was equally tasty. 

Great place and very clean."}
{"text":"I ended up at this place because it was near the area I was meeting someone and I saw their Yelp deal. This is similar to a YCs Mongolian BBQ in that you pick your own toppings and sauce combination, with the option of a rice or noodle bowl, or a salad. The people were very nice and helpful, and I liked being able to choose my own toppings to create a dish. 

I got a rice bowl with chicken and veggies, and I was happy with the sauce they recommended. The portions were a little smaller than expected, but it was enough to fill me up. The Yelp deal was a great value and I think that I would end up there more often if there was one closer to me. Seems like this would be an inexpensive and healthy alternative for those who want fresh and real food and don't want to make it themselves!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend ordered me food from here and it was tasteless. It was so bad I couldn't finish it. She was very disappointed because she likes this place for some reason."}
{"text":"This is pretty great! You choose your own everything here. Base, Sauce protein and toppings. I chose chicken and steak, broccoli, bean sprouts, carrots and spinach on noodles. The sweet n spicy sauce was so good. They cook it right there and it's served hot. Nice, big portion as well. Service was amazing. The girls behind the counter were so helpful. There are salads and wraps as well. Get here."}
{"text":"Extremely impressed! The south west chicken wrap with heated chicken is amazing!! We were referred by the business next door, and I'm glad we took their advice!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Uber eats and the food was terrible. Ordered a steak bowl and chicken bowl. Sesame oil and soy sauce for the steak bowl was just pure oil and spicy with no other flavors whatsoever. the Chicken I ordered Szechuan and it was just spicy and had no other flavors. No salt or other flavors to make this taste good. food was terrible and wasted $20. never ordering again."}
{"text":"Didn't even eat here. Walked in and the whole restaurant smelled like a bathroom. Was so grossed out my husband and I left immediately"}
{"text":"Came to this place looking for a light lunch.  I had the grilled chicken salad.  Huge portion of salad...two people could actually share it.  You get to pick two veggies to top the greens mix.  I chose broccoli and red bell pepper.  Tons of chicken and very fresh veggies made the salad fabulous!  The boys got the steak panini.  They said the meat was good.  Too much bread in my opinion, but they said it was super yummy."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week... Chicken, steak, and shrimp hot bowls are ALL delicious! The prices are decent and it's the perfect amount of food."}
{"text":"Love the BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad! Generous portions, always fresh ingredients. Staff is friendly and courteous. Restaurant is always very clean."}
{"text":"Chicken Cobb Salad is AMAZING! Totally ordering it again!

Husband had the Grilled Chicken & Avocado Panini and really... how can you go wrong with that? He loved it. 

We had it delivered, so to get the order to the 'minimum' we ordered chips and a cookie. 

Chips: Miss Vickies Sea Salt & Vinegar - REALLY GOOD. 
Cookie: some sort of chocolate chip. I've had better. Won't order it again. 

I'd like to try the hot bowls. They look awesome!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time today and the chicken avocado panini was amazing, it's a lot bigger then I expected it to be but I have a little appetite so I probably would've been good with a half, either way it was delish.  Staff was very friendly and helpful, they could tell I was a new customer. I'll be back again tomorrow."}
{"text":"I brought my son here with me for lunch to give it a try. We received a mailer with a coupon for a free entree, I figured it wouldn't hurt to give it a shot. My wife and I made fun of the name when we got the mailer, it didn't seem like a restaurant name really.

However, when we visited today we were greeted with a big smile from the girl behind the counter. I ordered a chicken tikka masala panini (weird sounding, I know , but it was free so I thought I'd go out on a limb) and I got my son a chicken quesadilla.

I was blown away, the food was great and the service was fantastic. The chicken was cooked PERFECTLY and the tikka masala sauce was flavorful. The quesadilla was loaded with cheese and chicken. They even offered my son a free apple!

We'll definitely be back. We're in the area a lot for Ike's next door, but when we want a healthier option I think we'll be stopping here from now on."}
{"text":"I have eaten this establishment 3 times in the past 2 weeks and have not been disappointed. Salads are fresh and tasty.  Portions are large and staff is friendly.  Panini's are also very good."}
{"text":"Fresh is the understatement!   Get your $6 salads or wraps for their grand opening specials!"}
{"text":"Fresh is the key word here. The ingredients are fresh and how the combine them is up to you. I had the shrimp bowl with noodles and the spicy peanut sauce. I recommend adding green onions, red pepper, and boiled egg. I added tofu which tasted great but wasn't needed with this combo since the shrimp were plentiful.

Another good combination is chicken with noodles and Alfredo sauce. You can add calamata olives and artichokes to complete a Mediterranean theme.

The good is prepared fast and the staff is helpful and friendly. I'll be back!"}
