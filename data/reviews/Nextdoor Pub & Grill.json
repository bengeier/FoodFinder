{"text":"I'll just begin by saying that I love this place. I've been there a couple of time, always on Wednesday because they have their Martini Mercredi deal; 6$ instead of 9$ for their delicious martini. The bartender, Stefano, is super nice and can make you some tasty martini according to your taste. Really, their martini are amazing! :)  I never had any food except for their bottle cap jalapeño which consist of slice of jalapeño fried served with a ranch sauce, it's pretty epic.  Every time I went, it was full which affected the wait time, it was sometime long but that's okay when you're in good company. Also, it's quite small but it's never feels too crowded and the decor is nice.  Overall it's an amazing pub that I'll keep on going to when I want martini!"}
{"text":"I've only been here on Sunday night (wing night) but I go nearly every week and I've only missed a handful of Sundays in the last year and a half. The wings are cheap and delicious, the drinks are well priced, and the staff is excellent. My girlfriend loves the deep fried Mars bar, too. If I lived in the neighbourhood, I'd be there more often, but as it is my friends and I metro down to NDG from the Plateau and Petite Patrie every week.   If watching the big game is your thing, it's a great place for that too. I've been at Nextdoor a few times during playoffs games, and the atmosphere in the bar was almost as intense and exciting as it must have been in the Bell Centre.   I love this place. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"A fairly non-descript neighbourhood pub. The drinks are reasonably priced, and the food is what you'd expect from any other pub: good enough to hit the spot and soak up the booze, but unremarkable enough that it won't leave you with any impressions.  Given the neighbourhood, it's the only thing pub-like nearby, and a safe bet it that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"One of the best bars in my neighborhood, cool and polite staff with nice behavior, best quality of food and fair price. Next door is always my first choice to have fun, drink, and eat."}
{"text":"Dry chicken wings. Good price on sundays but the quality is just not there. service not great also, a bit rude and tired staff."}
{"text":"Very nice waitress, but the food is almost inedible. Wings aren't good, but I finished mine.  Ordered two eggs over easy with bacon and white toast... one of my eggs was over cooked, which happens, but the potatoes are just gross to be frank. They look uncooked and wet.  Bacon was fine, but not great quality.  Toast was still bread.........  Ordered a Caesar and it was quite good.  Clearly this bar is a BAR for a reason. Definitely not restaurant first.  Nice staff but very small quarters. Too bad!"}
{"text":"What a gem!   I love that this place exists and that it really is close enough to be \"next door\"! It has great vibes, great staff, and great grub. The prices are crazy affordable and the portions are enormous.   From 5à7s every day of the week to ~martini Wednesday's~ to wings night to bottomless brunch, there is always a good reason to stop by!  Bottom line, it's a great neighbourhood haunt worth checking out.   Pro tip: forget pints. Live a little and order the euro ;)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and best friend took me here for my birthday. The service was very attentive, food was really good. They have various special throughout the week, when we were there they had a special on martinis.  I had the cosmo, which you can't go wrong,  and the June bug, a tropical martini which makes you feel like your on a beach.  It's a tiny place, so it can get crowded, but it's a great little neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night to celebrate an occasion with a couple friends, and one of them suggested Nextdoor. We arrived around 8pm, and it was packed, but it was a good kind of full. Nextdoor has nailed that nice, welcoming \"neighborhood pub\" kind of vibe, and it wasn't obnoxious or stressful.   We all ordered beers, and a plate of wings (6 Montreal steak spice and 6 honey garlic). The wings were amazing, and they have a good variety of flavors. Our server was efficient, and came back occasionally to ask us how we were doing, despite how busy they were.   It's really busy, but it has a great vibe and reasonable prices. If you're looking for that \"neighbourhood pub\", Nextdoor certainly delivers!"}
{"text":"Première visite: ça DOIT être un dimanche! Après 5h, les ailes de poulet sont à 30 sous chaque. Une assez grande variété d'ailes de poulet à essayer. Si vous venez en groupe (nous autres on était 4), essayez en plusieurs sortes et partagez. Le pub est très petit, les tables sont très rapprochées et bondées, l'ambiance est tamisée. Ce ne serait pas mon premier choix de pub pour sortir en couple, ni fréquemment, mais étant une amatrice d'ailes, c'est quand même l'un des premiers dans ma liste si j'ai une fringale d'ailes de poulet. Pour toutes ces raisons, je mets un 4*."}
{"text":"It's a bar in NDG. And that's pretty much all you need to know. There is a serious and detrimental dearth of good watering holes in The Deeg and this place helps. Get a Boulevardier ... it is an excellent idea. Euro pints of Sapporo."}
{"text":"I used to like the food and service at Nextdoor. They have amazing fries, wings and chilli but tonight was a disappointment. We ordered a poutine and chilli to curb our winter cravings. Both were extremely salty. I had 3 spoons of chilli and could not finish the rest so it was returned to the kitchen. If food is returned because a customer can not eat it because it was drowning in salt, the customer should not be charged. No body likes to spend their money poorly or on poor quality food. Not going back."}
{"text":"I'm always impressed by how packed this neighborhood pub is, even on a Sunday night. The $0.29 wings special on Sundays must be the best deal in town - coupled with $4 pints of house beer and I'm a happy frugal patron. There are a handful of wing flavours: stick with honey garlic and BBQ, the rest are salt assault. Nexthill, the house beer, is A-OK. Nachos are a huge portion.  I'd say it's the crowd and small cozy hood feel that sets this pub appart from an otherwise ordinary bar serving commercial beer. The staff is super cool."}
{"text":"My fave bar in NDG because the staff is so cool. The food is pretty good and they make a great Caesar."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Hidden gem in ndg. High energy staff, small but mega solid menu. A charming little pub."}
{"text":"I went to this bar one evening with a friend and was surprised at how packed in it was, there was literally one table left for us to sit at. You definitely do not go here to have a private conversation with someone. The staff seemed very in control despite the volume of people and came to our table 3 or 4 times before we were ready to order. I ordered some perogies... PEROGIES at a bar!! They were an awesome snack! They also have a cool looking selection of martinis I would someday like to try as well as a Deep Fried Mars Bar located in the dessert menu.... Very interesting and definitely different menu. If everything is as good as my perogies were I'm not surprised that this is a popular place and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went in for a hockey night, was really fun. The service was surprisingly fast and the hot chicken wing?! Really great. They have a big screen for watching sports. Prices acceptable."}
{"text":"This bar is great for what it is. Great local bar with decent prices. Chill there all the time with my friends.  P.S. Their perogies, nachos, and sweet potatoe fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience there a couple of weeks ago on a Friday night. Arrived just before 10pm so our group was able to grab the last available table. The waitress was friendly and efficient. The mac n cheese and the sweet potato fries were delicious. This place's atmosphere was definitely alive and fun! A neighbourhood gem.  This was in stark contrast with my first experience there last year, when we had a horrible experience food and service-wise at brunch! Lesson learned; go for late night food & drinks."}
{"text":"I always feel so welcomed when I'm here.   Their beer selection has changed recently but it is is still good.   Great bourbon and (red) wine selection as well.    I've come here on wing night, taco Tuesday, and martini Wednesday countless times.  I'm never disappointed by the service and quality of food.   Although it's a small space, it's worth the wait in line."}
{"text":"Located in a deeply pub deprived neighbourhood, this place stuffs the entire atmosphere into one cute place. A European feeling, sexy but comfortable setting had me and my girlfriend enjoy an intimate date, regardless of the very very high volume, still can talk. There was a large amount of people not there for food and just drinks, of which they seemed to have a large amount of hard alcohol, but we had beer. The beer menu is small, but the whole place is small so it's alright. And it's not low quality beer at all. In the summer it would be nice to enjoy outside. The server had a really great beard, which is always good.   The food was alright, I had the tao wings.. didn't have a ton of flavour either way but the sauce was nice to dip in. Think it was blue cheese.  The lady enjoyed a part of the poutine she ordered as the amount was absolutely massive. The kitchens open till 1 am as well, which is great.   Would definitely go back. Only thing we didn't like was the behaviour of some other guests we saw being rude to the server. That just happens when you're located next to Westmount though, not the pubs fault."}
{"text":"Our first time in Montreal on Christmas Day as tourist and stumbled upon this place. Not many places open on his day. This place was great all around. Service very well and friendly. Drinks were great and the ambience was alive and welcoming. Felt like a local instantly. The Christmas Devore and vibe truly set the night and saved our Christmas night outing. Highly recommended if you want good drinks and a good ambience for good prices."}
{"text":"My review may be a little biased because I was a little tipsy when we got here, but I ordered the chicken fajitas without cheese or tortillas. I was pleasantly surprised that it was fresh and delicious! Price was good and the salsa was actually really incredible? It wasn't all overly salty and the veggies and chicken were fresh and yummy. I really enjoyed it.  We were served all night by the infamous Jerry, and as always he was great and never stopped smiling and I think I ended up drinking a bottle of gin by myself. We had a blast! He and the female bartender who was very nice and I think I hit on were a great duo and handled the surprisingly packed place efficiently! I look forward to going back next time I'm up there. Away from the crowded downtown but still a lot of fun because you can have a blast without being molested by the 18 year old tourists!"}
{"text":"I should probably be paid for the amount I have been advertising and promoting this bar. We went to Nextdoor Pub on a rather uneventful Friday evening and we stumbled upon this small but insanely crowded bar. We got in after a few minutes and I kid you not it was so full I could have probably screamed the words in gibberish and people would not notice. We were thoroughly impressed by the variety of martini's they had, we ordered our sangria and a couple of appetizers. The staff was extremely friendly, they even apologized for the waiting line.  I must say, that was te best red wine sangria I have had in Montreal (note: when it comes to sangria I have probably had mine and five other people's fair share)  The appetizers were cooked fresh and they were way too good for regular bar finger food. The spicy sausages were good size portions and the jalepeno poppers were too tasty that we burnt the roof of our mouths in the process (once burnt, you just keep eating cause its sinful to stop with just one)   I highly recommend this to everyone, even if it is slightly out of your way or there is a line. Loved the attitude of the staff and the drinks keep haunting me to come visit again soon"}
{"text":"My review is based on the food only, and from an american's perspective. I eaten some of the best mouthwatering wings from southern georgia to new york city to overseas. For the most part the wings at nextdoor pub & grill just suck. I was expecting wingporium (toronto) level wings at least and got dominoe's level chicken. The BBQ was nasty. I literally wiped off the sauce with a napkin. The honey garlic sauce was decent. It should be noted that these wings dont have their own flavor. Even though wings are tossed in sauce, the wings themselves should have it's own flavor. Once the sauce wears off, you realize you are eating unseasoned chicken. If I'm ever in Montreal again, I will definitely not come here."}
{"text":"Yah, I'll be back. I don't spend much time in this area, but it is nostalgic for me and some of my best friends are out here and I look forward to meeting them for pints at this classic, welcoming pub. I walked in at like 1:30pm on a Friday and it was just the right kind of full. Folks having friendly lunches with a beer or glass of wine, nice mix of ages and vibes in the clientele, the true in effable feeling of a neighbourhood public house that makes my wee heart happy.   I sat at the bar and had a totally enjoyable pint and laugh with the staff. I ordered the pasta special since I was in a bit of a rush, and I think I'd order one of the classic pub dishes from their menu instead next time, it tasted a bit like I was eating something that had been invented to get through a weird collection of leftover ingredients. But I was also under the weather and my tastebuds were in weirdo mode, so that's not entirely on them. Still, I think a mac and cheese or chicken wings would be the better move next time. Looking forward to it!   Also wanted to give a shoutout to the chalk artist who does all their menus - her work is all over the small bar and it's beautiful and neat and really adds to a feeling of being in a space that cares. Small thing but I loved it."}
{"text":"I enjoy my visits to the pub. The staff are great guys (& gals) and Sundays are chicken wing nights that tend to perk up my weekend. They used to have great jazz Thursdays as well, shows how dynamic the small space can be. It's a really inviting setup that seems to suit every season better than the last.  Food: 9/10 Service: 9/10 Price: 9/10 Atmosphere: 10/10"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and creepy dudes are kicked out when they start being gross. Super welcoming environment for women :)"}
{"text":"Fun place.  We stayed nearby and walked here for dinner and drinks.  This place is small but handles the crowd well.  The bar staff was excellent.  Had some Swedish fish shots that were very good.  We had a great time."}
{"text":"Really cool bar in NDG. Nice staff, always open, good drinks, nice food options. Good size: cozy, but not tiny. Nice layout and location. Staff also nice. Though it gets too loud for my taste on sports nights.  This and Honey Martins hugely contribute to making NDG a great place to live."}
{"text":"Was visiting in town for two weeks and was trying quite a few pubs/bars in the area and made my way to this place. The staff was very personable and very attentive. My second visit there I met Jay the bar manager and was hooked. I ended up going 3 times in the last week i was there. i ate a meal every time and was never let down. The chili that was recommended was amazing. The bar tenders were some of the best I have dealt with along with the atmosphere. Met great people every time I was there and met some people I plan to come back and visit. If you are in the area this is a great place to stop by."}
{"text":"I don't go to PND often, but it's a nice spot if you just want to enjoy a beer and some food after work or a quick catch up with friends.    During the hockey season, they show the game on the tvs and one bigger projector screen.  However, if you don't show up 2-3 hours in advance depending on where we are in the season, there is no chance of getting a seat.  I have been there while seeing a line of people going out the door.  Overall, it is a really small space and being comfortable when it is busy can be a bit of a struggle but the staff is AMAZING.  The food is great and on Sundays, how can you beat 29 cent wings (SO tasty).  My friends love this spot and it's definitely a place you'll want to revisit."}
{"text":"Good neighbourhood bar with lots of potential. It is what it is. Nice outdoor terrasse. A little overpriced on the whiskey. The food isn't remarkable but decent. I am intrigued by the deep fried mars bars and cheese cake. Next time."}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday brunch, we were 8. After a little rocky start for reasons out of everyone's control, the staff and management went above and beyond to fix a the issue.   The staff has great personality, from the busboy busting out in song to apologize for the wait. (Is it too late now to say sorry..by BEIBER) as well as signing Adele, to the whole staff signing me happy birthday with cake. (Deep fried mars bar.. Mmmmmm) Just a really sweet experience.  They have super yummy ceaser's and mimosa's. They are BOTH endless on Sundays and you can rotate back and forth!  They also have a good wing promotion on Sunday   The bar itself is pretty tiny, but has good seating options as well as a good section for groups. It's got a great decor"}
{"text":"Il n'a fallu que quelques minutes pour que je sache que je reviendrai créer des souvenirs dans ce pub. C'est petit, mais il y a un coin pour tout le monde: les amis peuvent se partager une grande table et les mains peuvent se caresser sous la table près du foyer ;) J'ai aussi été témoin de belles jasettes au bar entre les employés et les habitués. La bonne entente entre les employés est palpable aussi. Sans tomber dans le cliché, le bar a une âme.   Ce n'est pas du tout un gastropub mais une belle attention a été mise dans le graphisme du menu papier. Il y a aussi une jolie ardoise pour le menu des boissons. Et puis, franchement, on a commandé plusieurs choses qui étaient satisfaisantes au goût, en portions copieuses et à dévorer avec l'aide de plusieurs napkins, haha! Je préférerais à l'avenir commander un burger de buf plutôt que celui au poulet: j'ai trouvé que la poitrine croustillante était trop grande pour le pain, ce qui est un beau problème me direz-vous avec raison, mais je préfère moins de viande et davantage de garnitures dans mes sandwichs. Puisque Yelp en raffole, j'ai fait commander à mon amie quelques ailes de poulet, et son verdict a été qu'elles étaient bonnes mais pas exceptionnelles, peut-être un peu trop cuites. Toutefois, nous nous sommes entendues toutes les deux que les bâtonnets de mozzarella étaient vraiment, vraiment plein de fromage, donc parfaits.   La cerise sur le sundae: se faire souhaiter bonne soirée avec une poignée de main. Ça, ça nous fait sentir que notre visite est appréciée. Hospitalité +++"}
{"text":"This is a cool neighborhood pub. Nice selections of tap-beers for your standard IPA and Red's to your dark stout (Guinness). I meet with some friends and the place was perfect, not to loud, cool food selection and reasonably priced beer (7-8$ per pint, 14-16$ for 1 litter and around 25$ for a pitcher). just like a neighborhood bar is suppose to be."}
{"text":"MANDATORY SUNDAY WINGS NIGHT.  There is nowhere else in the world you should be on a Sunday night than with your friends at Nextdoor. The fun staff (led by a great manager) make this place."}
{"text":"Sunday wings day! For all the chicken wings lovers out there. THIS is the place to satisfy your cravings. Every Sunday they offer chicken wings for 39 cents!!! Minimum of 6 wings per order/flavor. Me and my husband tried like 7 different flavors! From spicy hot to jerk chicken, dry steak rub, spicy BBQ and they even had a spicy general tao one..which was my favorite! There's a flavor for everyone's taste. They werent too small, had the right amount of sauce where it's finger licking good after each wings and on top of that they were slightly crispy. Service was amazing and they provide you with a metal bowl for the bones, wet towelettes and a big roll of paper towel that will save you when things get too messy."}
{"text":"Tres bruyant surtout avec un match sportif sur les ecran tv, ambiance assurée, brunch standard .. Very slow service .. English speaking staff."}
