{"text":"Cheers! This place is awesome! Over 30 artisanal craft beers on tap with an ever-changing and always pleasing selection. The variety of beets is to be applauded, friendly staff and a fun atmosphere make this one of my favorite places in town. I come in regularly. They also have an impressive food menu."}
{"text":"This is an absolute can't miss in Phoenix. With 31 constantly rotating taps you will find old favorites and new. Beers do repeat on occasion, but there is always something different awaiting you.   If bottles beer is more your style you can ask for that menu and try something completely new. There are also 6 wine taps if that is more your style.   The food is absolutely phenomenal. It's all made in house so it tastes fresh and it is delicious. They have a seasonal menu as well. I really can't say anything bad ... Other than they are closed on Monday."}
{"text":"I super love that they have Spam and can add it to things! Love the different types of beer. I had #3, a raspberry wheat by grand canyon brewing; smell of raspberry and initial taste is the fruit with the after taste being kinda creamsicle-y. They also have draft wines.  So, to start off, we had the Mess, which was a mess, but a hot delicious one! The gravy that comes atop the fries was delish. The fries weren't too skinny and didn't get too soggy from the gravy but then again, I don't we let it sit long enough to get soggy. And the cheese curds made for a nice crunch with it. After eating it, I really wanted to add Spam and get a side of gravy lol. Maybe next time.  After the mess, it was now onto the pizza - the meaty treat. It certainly was a meaty treat for your mouth. It had all sorts of meat but with the added Spam, what can I say but 'heaven' (I'm Asian and I love my Spam). Next time, and there will be a next time, there should be a flight involved and another pizza with more Spam lol."}
{"text":"I went to Angels Trumpet with my husband (G) last week for dinner and drinks.   For the most part, I really liked the place. It looks like an office building from the outside and from the inside, it looks like a cozy place to grab a bite to eat and a beer. Their beer selection is pretty awesome and featured on a chalkboard on the back wall.  I ordered the Fall Cider by Woodchuck and the grilled cheese sandwich dinner. The cider was delicious and perfectly chilled. The grilled cheese was SO good! I love the fact that they put mint on it - so unique and surprisingly tasty! The fries were not that great because they seemed to be a bit undercooked.  G's meal was a burger (if memory serves) and the \"chips\". He said they were both good.  So, what we both didn't like were the awful chairs. They are wooden slats and very uncomfortable to sit on for any length of time. The place was only about 1/4 full and we couldn't hear each other even though we were sitting directly across from one another. The place has to do something about the acoustics - it is far too loud to be able to carry on a conversation. And, the only other negative was the lighting. Instead of real overhead lighting, they have gone with tiny candles on the tables. It was too dark to read the menu unless you had it right up against the table.  Other than those issues, the place was great!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for date night with no baby.  The beer selection is great; however, they only have them posted on the blackboard above the bar.  The waitress wasn't able to give to many suggestions based on the type of beers we told her we liked.   On all honesty, if you work in an ale house you should know your beers.    I ordered the matador sandwich which was barbecue brisket with havarti cheese, mushrooms, peppers and horseradish sauce.  The waitress food was brought out and the sand which looked like roast beef.  I took a bite, sure enough it was roast beef and it was dry...super dry.  I asked the waitress and she came back and told me that she made a mistake and was supposed to tell me that the sandwich is now made with roast beef and the menus haven't been updated.  She of course apologized and I had to wait for my sandwich.  My husband, had finished his meal and they finally brought out a sandwich made with brisket.  The sandwich was definitely not worth the wait, not to mention I was eating alone.  The sandwich was supposed to have havarti cheese and I barely saw the cheese.  The meat was dry and had very little flavor.  On top if it all, the waitress didn't even comp the sandwich.  I don't ever plan on returning to this place again.  It's unfortunate we wasted a date night baby free at this establishment."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Tacos are so incredible. Don't even get me started on the pop tarts! TO DIE FOR. Great to come hang out with a bunch of girls and have a great time. Can't wait to try some of their ales the next time I come here (which will definitely be in the very near future)!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer and tasty menu of creative dishes (though definitely not a healthy menu). The garden out back is fun!"}
{"text":"Disappointed the proprietor participated in a selfish and ultimately successful scheme to subvert a local initiative to establish a district to improve the neighborhood. He's got a great place, but for this 25+ year downtown resident, a shop that just opened in 2012 is a relative newcomer to the scene. I choose carefully where I spend my money, and the nature and character of the owners of an establishment influences that decision mightily. There are too many competitors downtown now. We now avoid Angel's Trumpet. I do miss it, but..."}
{"text":"awesome parking for downtown location. Friendly workers and some strong beers. Good selection and they have a knack for good music."}
{"text":"First of all, what's up with the downtown area? I've been living in the suburbs of Phoenix for 20 years and I never thought of the downtown area as being a \"happening\" place. When we got off I-10 and proceeded south, there was traffic and people every where. We were really surprised.  We went to Angel's Trumpet on a Friday night and arrived around 7 p.m. The wait time was about 15 minutes and we were able to pass the time in comfortable chairs on the back patio. A waitress came by and offered us water or drinks while we were waiting. Even though it was about 110 degrees that day, the misters kept the outside area cool so it was comfortable when the first available table was outside.   Beer: The beer selection was great and they seemed to have various styles for everyone. I love amber beers, and although they only had one selection (Sunset Amber), it was a tasty beer. As is typical of most bar establishments, the beer selection was heavier on the IPA, porter, and wheat style beers. My boyfriend and friends tried several kinds (unfortunately I was the DD so I couldn't try as many) and they enjoyed each one. A particular favorite was Sculplin IPA. If it wasn't so hot outside I may have tried one of their wines \"on draft.\"  Food: Amazing flavor combinations! It took us a long time to decide what we wanted to eat and none of us were disappointed with our food choices. I had a sandwich (\"Bingo\")  from the daily special menu with french fries which were served with marinara sauce instead of ketchup (delicious). We had the poptarts which is why we tried Angel's Trumpet in the first place. The seasonal poptart was bourbon peach which had a type of oatmeal crumble on the top (no frosting). It was delicious - flaky dough with fantastic flavor.   Service: Not great for us, but tables around us had much better service. Angel's Trumpet was busy, but our waiter was either not very organized or just slow compared to the waitress buzzing around to the other tables around us. I wish we would have had her instead. For instance, a table behind us on the patio was sat at least five minutes after us and we hadn't even been greeted yet. Then the people who were seated behind us had drinks and food (appetizer) before our beers even arrived. Our slow waiter was very irritating.  Overall: It's a long drive downtown just for food, but we will definitely be back (hopefully with the stellar waitress and not the slow waiter). We all enjoyed our time at Angel's Trumpet and liked the energy of that area in general. It was also fun to see so many different ages congregating in one place."}
{"text":"Really, really good choice. Outstanding beer selection, good menu, good staff. Don't miss the \"Big Guppy\" on the menu."}
{"text":"Certainly one of the tastiest burgers I have ever had was here. Unfortunately I cannot recall the name but it had bacon and an egg on it so you certainly can't go wrong.   They have a pretty great selection of beer available which they change daily however, they do not have a formalized beer list but rather provide a chalk board style selection of everything which is a personal pet peeve of mine but... its ok. I would suggest sitting at the bar or a close table if you plan to read it.   ** Updated to 5 stars. Have had amazing experiences since my first review and highly highly recommend their t.v. dinner night on Tuesdays. So good!!!!"}
{"text":"I am sold the flights of beer!  6 samples of craft beers in one setting will sell me every time.  Exploring craft beers can be a tricky game...we've all ordered a beer that didn't fit our palette and you have to WORK your way thru it.  I explored 3 styles of beers I'd never tried and then finished with 3 favorites to satisfy the taste buds.  There was a nice variety of food on the menu.  They have an interesting take on wings with the sauce on the side. Tried one of the salads which was tasty, but left you a little hungry...especially since it was the same price as the wings.  That moved us onto the Sweet Potato Tacos, which area little more like empanadas, but really tasty with a pesto dipping sauce.  Living in the southwest for so long I'd like to some type of hot sauce on the table or a homemade concoction to bring the heat.  The noise is a little loud, but they'll get the acoustics figured out.  The openness of the floor plan and windows will make it a great year round place for a pint.  It's smack dab in the middle of the Evans Churchill district which is great for a pub crawl"}
{"text":"I guess it's about time I got around to writing a review for this place. We eat here almost weekly, and have for the last two-plus years. We have a couple favorite servers but really most of them are good. (There have been some iffy ones in the past, but those seem to be gone.) Because of the service, we walk away almost every week saying how much we love the place.   Beer selection is always interesting. There are usually a couple that appeal to any taste. The flight option is great and you really get a lot of beer for the price. Wednesday's are usually their special event tappings and sometimes you can get a free glass for buying a beer.   We typically go on Tuesdays, which is their TV dinner night. This is the only reason I don't give the place 5 stars. TV dinner has been very hit or miss in the last 6 months or so. We've had some great ones and some terrible ones and some that are just okay. The old chef did a better job at being consistently good. But, if you get a good one, it's a solid amount of food for not much money. I haven't had anything bad off of their regular menu - wings are solid, burgers and sandwiches very good, guppy tacos are fantastic. The desserts are also quite tasty!  Parking can be painful since it's downtown. They have a small lot that is usually full. There are a few un-metered spots but most are metered (most accept cc's now at least).   Oh! Dog friendly patio, and they'll bring water for your pup. Only recommended in nicer weather though as they don't consistently turn the misters on when it's hot."}
{"text":"Obnoxiously greasy food is this restaurant's biggest flaw."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Food was ok, but why in the name of everything holy are restaurants making their own Ketchup now? The Home made Ketchup here is terrible. If you are going to make your own at least offer an alternative."}
{"text":"Great beer and great food.  We had the pizza and it was very good to go with our flight sampler."}
{"text":"Incredible ambiance that matches a unique menu. The salads are delicious and the simple menu packs a punch of flavor. A huge drink menu will pair with any of the menu items. This place is a jem."}
{"text":"I liked it a lot!  The beer choice is great though there weren't too many IPA choices.  I'm not a fan of double IPAs nor the wheat nor the dark stouts so that limited my choices.    The yummy chef's burrito was great!  So large I ate only half and the other half in the morning.  I sat at the bar and had a hard time seeing the beer choices on the chalkboard wall b/c of the glare of the light but that's ok, I just stood up and walked around to read them!  Not a big deal.    Fun atmosphere and outdoor seating was great.  Friendly people everywhere.  I rode my bike here and just locked it up outside.  Nice neighborhood feel.  I will definitely return here!  The film bar across the street is a nice activity to follow up with after dinner and happy hour!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is really good and the service has always been great. It's my go-to place when I am with friends, clients, etc. And looking for a place to just sit, eat, drink, and socialize. Their beverage menu is very impressive and changes all the time. Every time I come here there is something new to try. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Beer 5 star Food 3 star Service 1 star Atmosphere 1 star  Not as awestruck as I had thought I would be. Food was very hit or miss. Recommend reading the menu very well or you could get someone's attempt at a sweet savory burger that is too far in either direction to blend well.   Do try the wings and the hot pretzel. The Matador was pretty good too, reminded me of a Philly steak sandwich but on a pretzel bun.   My husband had the \"Meat Treat\" flat bread pizza. It was good but we had to ask the waitress where it was, she returned to tell us \"they are remaking your order, it will be up in a few (was not a few) minutes.\"   I realize it's Friday night, and they were busy, but after our initial seating we had to flag the waitress down for everything and then she would disappear again. Once I flagged her down, she would immediately dart off, and I'd have to say \"WAIT..\" or she'd take one person's order and leave without asking if anyone else needed anything.  The ketchup that was served with the fries, was pretty awful. That needs to go.   The house pop tart, tastes very much like the Pillsbury dough boy made it. I'd recognize that overly sweet vanilla icing anywhere."}
{"text":"Always has a good tap list, and you can use TapHunter to see what is one tap. I love that that regularly update this. The food is good as well. It gets pretty busy on the weekends. I will say that the service is not great. One time me and 3 friends stood at the bar for 15 minutes without being asked what we wanted to order, all this while trying to get the bartenders attention, before leaving to go somewhere else. I have had other unpleasant interactions there as well, but have continued to go back due to the good beer selection."}
{"text":"Very generous owners donated gift certificates to teachers of a nearby school for Teacher Appreciation Week.  Our staff love this restaurant, its patio, and vibe.  It is a great place to decompress, laugh and rejuvenate after busy day.  Food is great and servers are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, great atmosphere (except for acoustics which make the place hard to carry on a conversation.  patio when not so hot is much better).  Loved this place.  not anymore.  not with the plethora of other amazing restaurants downtown.  took another couple with us tonight. had 8 beers, appetizer, and food.  One of the girls ordered a beer that was listed as a peach flavored. she was thinking it would be similar to the 4 peaks peach.  turned out it was an awful tasting sour beer.  we sent it back  and requested another.  When the bill came we were charged for the sour beer.  Asked the waiter to talk to manager saying we didn't think we should pay for a beer we didn't drink.  She came back and said manager said he wouldn't take it off.  nice customer service!  on a beer that probably cost them a buck.   ruined an otherwise nice night."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for a couple of days for a conference and found this place this first evening, a Wednesday, and was impressed enough to bring friends back Friday. It is great! I don't know what the complaints in other reviews about the service are talking about. The Tractor pizza with eggs and brussel sprouts was even better than I was hoping. As a brewer and fan of Belgian ales, I was impressed with their selection on tap, and the choose-your-own flights made me very happy."}
{"text":"It was great!  We loved the fresh backed pretzels, shrimp flatbread, and plenty of delicious beer!  Nice staff and cool decor.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After our first visit a week after opening, it was obvious that there were some kinks to work out. The first visit, I was impressed by the beer selection. It was wonderful and definitely lead to our second visit. The misses to me the first go around were the food and the noise level. The outdoor patio was also very dark. The lighting was better for the second visit, but I have yet to retry the food. I got the pizza but wasn't impressed. Just an odd flavor paring. The noise level wasn't as bad this time, but that could have been because it wasn't as busy and  opening the doors also helped. Can't wait to get back for more good beer and great patio weather soon."}
{"text":"AWFUL SERVICE.  Selection changes daily, which makes it a fun place to go. A couple servers are good and knowledgeable. The food is ok, but overpriced for what it is. You pay for the trendy atmosphere.  We came in at 10:40, and as we were seated, they let us know the kitchen closes at 11, so we should order soon. At 10:50, we had to find a server. She had been servicing a nearby table, ignoring us.  If you happen to order anything you don't like, too bad. They will charge you for it regardless. Ordered a beer, and it tasted sour. They explained how they could not exchange it for anything else, and would still charge me. WTF Bad business to refuse to even offer something different. Worse to charge a customer for something they do not want."}
{"text":"We went here for a friend's birthday dinner / happy hour and they quickly seated our large party of 15 on the patio. The ambiance is...brightly lit, industrial warehouse look, definitely not romantic but I would say fun for a first date. Not too loud so it's easy to carry on a conversation which would make it a good place for a business meeting or lunch (note to self!)  I ordered the chicken, pesto & spinach pizza which was yummy. We also splurged on the homemade \"pop tart\" which was really more like a puff pastry turnover but was good. On Tuesdays they also do a \"TV Dinner\"  which a few people got and enjoyed. Someone else mentioned that there aren't many gluten free choices and my GF friend and I shared my pizza - she scraped off the toppings!  They have a decent beer (around 30) selection, which they write on a chalkboard because the beers rotate in and out. A bunch of people tried the beer flights and I sponged off my friends flights lol. I ordered a full pint of what I know I like (raspberry framboise & guiness). I'm not an adventurous beer drinker.  The service was excellent and our waitress was super friendly.  I'm only giving it 3 stars because somehow this place lacks the appeal of wanting to go back and make it an official watering hole. It's OK. Maybe if they added music or something it would  make it more cozy."}
{"text":"I took my son who has been living in Sweden to Angels since he likes good beer.  And he was noy disappointed.  The price was right for the quality of the beer.  We also enjoyed the food I had the sweet potatoe tacos and the were great.  He loved that so many varieties of good beers were on tap.  Definitely going again especially if all three of my son's are home.   Good beer good food good people"}
{"text":"Okay, we have been meaning to try this place for a while, and on the way back from a WONDERFUL performance of Swan Lake by Ballet Arizona, we stopped in. Very cool vibes, great outdoor seating. We wish they would have more porters, stouts, or brown ales instead of so many IPA's...after all, it is fall! Beer was priced between $6-$8 a pint. Very attentive server, even though she was hopping through a lot of tables. We ordered the mess (a poutine of sorts) and the fun guy, a mushroom and veggie pizza. Both were seriously lacking any zip, just like the 2 stars, meh. I don't think the chef used any salt or other spices from the taste of them. Would we come here again? Nope, there are many, many other places that have much better food for the price and beer we actually like."}
{"text":"I'd give a 5 rating for their beer selection. I love that its constantly changing drawing you back to keep trying new beers. But I work downtown and have been wanting to go here for since they opened. They close at 11 everyday other than Friday and Saturday when they close at 12. They've been closed every night that I've tried to go. This past Friday I walked by just past 12 and they said they were closed. Even with a lot of people still inside. A lot of people heading to the Turf.   I finally had a chance to stop in when they were open. As I said the beer selection was amazing. I had no intentions on eating there since the menu seemed a little too far out there. We ate anyways. I had the nutter sandwich. Sounded interesting. Pb&j with raspberry-chipotle jam, banana, bacon and marshmallow cream. It was ok, but tasted like candle wax. I'm not sure why. My wife had the stroganoff burger. Not bad, the bun was burnt and cheese not melted. None of the food was hot. Fries were really good though even at room temp.  Their homemade ketchup tastes like sweetened marinara.   I would still recommend trying Angels Trumpet, but only for beers or even their wines on tap. Dine somewhere else.   We sat at a table inside and didn't have any issues with their service and didn't mind the noise. We could still talk to each other without yelling. The music playing in the background was good but could barely hear it."}
{"text":"I would prefer that you stay away from this place 'cause too many people could screw up the experience for the rest of us that have been gathering here since Matt & Sherry opened.  But the fact is that it's simply the best ale house west of the Mississippi.  Extraordinary beer selection, terrific food and a great staff."}
{"text":"I was meeting a pretty big group last night, and when we got there they were waiting to add another table so we could sit down. We figured it would be about 20 minutes so we sat at the bar for our first drink. A couple was leaving so we took their seats (their empty glasses in front of us...EMPTY). The bartenders waled by us and it was impossible to get their attention. When they did finally come over to us it was to talk over our heads to two customers waiting for drinks! We were finally able to make contact, at which point the bar tender pointed to the EMPTY glasses and just said \"oh, those aren't yours.\" OK, even if they HAD been ours they were empty! You should ask if we need anything else.  SO we had our $8.00 drink then made our way over to join our friends. Someone mentioned a menu was coming...never happened. The waiter saw us, but we couldn't get his attention long enough to ask for anything. Now at this point, I didn't WANT to give them my money for their overpriced beer and mediocre food. I did finally get the waiter's attention long enough to ask for water as he refilled everyone else's water glasses. He still didn't ask my friend and me if we wanted food or any drinks. They were pretty neglectful of our table in general - the number of empty glasses and the lack of attention to refilling said glasses was crazy! Everyone had to track down the server in order to get their bills (except my friend and me since we had zero service = zero dollars!). It was such awful service that I ended up using their patio simply to catch up with friends (that was nice) and drink their water. I didn't spend one more dime at their establishment after that first drink at the bar, which is crazy considering I went their with every intention of having at least 2 drinks and food. I will NOT come back here - My desire to spend that much money on drinks is approx. zero if the experience is THAT bad."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, really quick getting my two flights of beer. Had the smoked pork outlaw burger. Pretty good! Lots of folks having a good time with beer on a Tuesday night. Will return next time my quest for beer brings me to downtown Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Found this place online & checked it out for the beer selection.  We were not disappointed, a great craft beer selection with flight options so you can try a few before you commit.  We were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was too.  Tried the fish tacos and a \"fun-guy\" flatbread.  Both were very tasty.  A warning on the fish tacos, if you don't like cilantro you should avoid them.  I love cilantro so they were great for me, but wife despises cilantro and she couldn't finish them because the cilantro was overwhelming for her.    The only thing that kept it from being 5 stars for me was the noise level.  At times it was hard to hear my wife from across the table.  It wouldn't stop me from coming back, but just know what you are in for."}
{"text":"Phenomenal place with an awesome environment. The beer taps rotate often and it's everything I would drink. Every freakin beer! The wine on tap is perfect too. Great balance. The vibe is neutral and fits any generation. They have a wonderful main stay downtown and this place is where you need to be. Don't think twice if you are downtown. Angels Trumpet is the bomb."}
{"text":"Had matador burger tonight spicy yummy. We also had another burger and the peanut butter pretzel dessert.  We have been here many times and always great service and food.  Bison hot dog,  the nutter,  all the apps. you really cant go wrong here   The beers change all the time so you never get bored. And they have the wine on tap so it's a reasonable price.    The kitchen DOES close an hour before the actual closing time , so be sure to make note of that.  Also, you wouldn't think it but they have a great sunset view from the patio.  Note the sunset time in PHX and don't miss it !!!! Cant think of any other ground level downtown place with a great view ."}
{"text":"First time here and fall in love with this place. Great beer great food! What more can you ask for???"}
{"text":"For a beer and burger place it doesn't get much better. Great draft beers, the Brewlee was on point and the house made ketchup was a nice bonus."}
{"text":"dropped by on a Sat night...had to wait 15 mins for a table so by the time I sat down I was a little peeved. from then on my experience was good; ordered a burger and a Flatbread accompanied by a couple of local brews. actually the food and beer was very good. if you want your burger cooked order it well done.  overall good experience."}
{"text":"very good..sometimes.. youll come across servers that wanna get rid of you if u like particulars and they dont see it your way..   the beer IS EXCELLENT! TRY to make it to special tappings when they have them.. you wont know unless you ask.. and the ones to  ask are servers that are seasoned and have been around awhile  and Thomas Brennaman the GM and Tap manager he knows his beer and how to please his guests."}
{"text":"Fantastic craft beer selection. If you like wings, you won't be disappointed with the \"angels wings\". Nice safe location downtown."}
{"text":"Cool place with lots of tvs and good food.  Went just before the Cactus Bowl at Chase Field and the place was really busy.  Nice place to chat and hang out with friends.  Looking forward to going back and trying more of the food and drinks."}
{"text":"A Phoenix favorite! Must try the tractor pizza, and if you're not in the mood for beer they have wine on tap."}
{"text":"Delicious food (The Chet! The Game On! The Chocolate Chip Cookies!), an outstanding beer selection, and a very friendly staff.  Unlike some of the other Yelpers, I found the beer selection process intuitive and the staff knowledgeable.  I'd recommend the tasting flight so you can sample 6 beers - for $9 a great deal.    The only thing I would change would be some sort of noise insulation as when it is busy, it can get really loud.  But an excellent place over all.   Go for weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"Angels wins all around.   If you don't see a beer or a specific type you like (which I think is pretty hard) ask and 9:10 they'll recommend 1 that's close or they'll remember you next time you come in and they just might have it.   Food: 5 stars Beer: 5 stars Atmosphere: 4.99 stars (only dinged for .1 because it get's a little warm, but again it's Phx)  Enjoy it and try something you've never had before."}
{"text":"I travel all over the country and have eaten at lots of places. I have never wrote a review of anywhere, until now! This is the one of if not the best places I have ever eaten. Brewlee was amazing! On top of that service was just as good."}
{"text":"One of my top 3 places to go!  Excellent, ever changing beer selection. Loud enough where a loud child doesn't hassle others yet not so loud you can't talk.  Have gone with just my wife and had a blast and went with a group of 20 and had just as good of a time.  On our last trip, our server disappeared a few times for way too long, which was a bummer especially since we had a kid with a dirty diaper and had to get out of there but couldn't pay our bill.  But I won't hold that against the restaurant overall...the server seemed to be having her own issues.    Very diverse crowd, from retirees, to yuppees to hipsters, everyone seems welcome!"}
{"text":"Come for the beer - keep coming back for the beer and the food!    Wide variety of craft beers, all on tap.  The menu is best described, I think, as 'Imaginative Bar Food'.  The Bison hot dog BLT on Flatbread is possibly the best sandwich idea it the world.  Friends had the Garden Pizza and raved about it.  The seasonal pop tart for dessert was extremely good too.  Reasonable priced with a great space indoors and out.  Dog friendly too!  Why 4-stars? 1. Service was spotty at times but I think it was just our server.  2. unless you are very knowledgeable about craft beers, do not expect a lot of help from the wait staff.  They have limited knowledge of all 31 varieties on hand.  So you could just guess and get something less than appealing to you.  3. This gives them room to grow!  It is my new favorite default downtown destination for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This is a cool place in a good location. Great beer and lots of selection. WAY too loud inside and the food is average to below average. Great place to meet for drinks if you can handle the noise."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing beers and good atmosphere. What more could you wish for! They brought out corn hole for the kids and a bowl of water for the dog. Love this spot."}
{"text":"Downtown Restaurant Rock and this jem Ranks way High on the list... must come and eat...Lol Amazing Beers on tap huge Wonderful ubscure selection...!!!   Well the  FOOD is a Haven for us Foodies !!! Eat On.... Tue...TV dinners so Great.& Fun"}
{"text":"Downgrading a star. I'm here at least a couple of times a month. Since it opened, the quality of the food has just gone down. Service has as well. I've had waiters simply leave things at the table without trying to figure out who the order belongs to. I was hoping their bright start meant a bright future. They still look like they have an amazing beer selection, and the place itself is cool. But the food just isn't as good and service is suffering. I'm hoping for improvements!"}
{"text":"I like the concept, and I am excited to have a good local beer bar down the street.  The menu is awesome, and the service is friendly, but they need some help with organization."}
{"text":"It was ok.  We got there about 9pm, place was busy.  Took about 5 mins to be acknowledged and about 5 more to place our order.  Waitress was nice enough but not overly helpful.    I asked about their draft wine, she replied it's draft wine.  Hummmm, I sort of figured that out already.  I was looking more for where it came from, house wine?  Etc.  My friends got beer and it was nice and cold.    I really hope it is in for the long haul.  It's a nice place to have downtown.  I think with a few tweaks here and there it could wonderful!  Fingers crossed!  ."}
{"text":"One of my go to place these days if I'm looking to chug (I mean drink) some good beer. The selection here is one of the best I have found so far in the Valley and includes 20+ taps of a multitude of beer styles.  The offerings range from common year round beers and seasonals, to imports and some of the slightly harder to procure stuff (If only I had actually enjoyed that Bourbon County Brand Stout - woops).  Service is usually pretty quick even when crowded (as it can be on the weekends) and the food menu is delicious, sober or otherwise.  Definitely a fan of the wings, and spam sliders.  Need to try the tv dinners in the future.   They have a nice outdoor patio and seating area as well where you can enjoy a game of bags/cornhole.  Who doesn't like cornhole?  Honestly, if you are into craft beer or just beer-curious you need to try this place out asap."}
{"text":"Wonderfull joint. Kinda reminded me of a library walking up but inside far from it. Cool bar with huge beer selection. Nice themes for food on different days. Got the brulee burger with fried egg and sugar baked into the bun. Spectacular taste. Now that was a unique burger. Big, tasty, and sweet with arugula, onions and bacon. Definitely get that again. Huge portion. Had to share with the wife. Nice patio that allows dogs. Really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Angels received two stars only because it has a great draft beer selection.  Poor ownership/management decision to have last call @ 10:30 on a Thursday night and crappy acoustics ruin this place.  Downtown Phoenix has been dying to have a place like this.  So extend the hours of operation and install acoustics please!"}
{"text":"Definitely stop in for TV dinner on Tuesday nights; as though the ever-changing draft list wasn't enough. Their wild game sausage is also tremendous."}
{"text":"I love the place. It looks like everyone comes here, no matter what's you age. You will see a college student and a retiree. I guess anyone will find a beer among 30+ available beers. The food is great. We ordered a couple of flatbreads and those were great. I can't wait to taste other things on the menu...."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place with outside seating and followed the yelp reviews here. We all really enjoyed our meals (oddly we all got mexican: guppy (fish tacos), chet burrito and verde tacos). All were excellent. There was one item of our meal that was hugely disappointing however. There was a specials menu and Thursdays was tater tots. Not something we'd normally order, but for some reason it just sounded good to all of us. First off, there were no prices. This always annoys me when restaurants don't put prices on a menu. We asked the waitress who 'thought' they were $8, but assured us it was a big basket. They were small, but tasty, and for our party of 4 we'd guess we each got about 5 tater tots. She was right, it was a big basket, unfortunately there were hardly any tater tots in it."}
{"text":"Wish I could say something about the food or drinks, but the staff and manager were so incredibly rude to our large party that we left. We work in a large office nearby, and we routinely go out in large groups. Most places are very accommodating because they want the business- here, the manager acted like he was doing us a favor by allowing us in his restaurant. None of us will be back, and we're telling everyone in the office not to go here. Also, on a side note the bathrooms were disgusting."}
{"text":"Fantastic quality of food and beer. This is perhaps one of the best reasonably priced drinking establishments in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great spot downtown PHX! Great number of drinks on draft.  Fish tacos were super good. Others in my group got the Old Fashioned Burger and the Pork Grilled Cheese. Fantastic food all around. Great location. Staff was friendly.  I will most certainly be back! Great job Angels."}
{"text":"I tried it for a second time... and yep I still hate it. The beer list is confusing - good beer but confusing, the ambience is atrocious, and the bartenders have a lack of knowledge about the beer. This place is very disappointing."}
{"text":"I wish there was a 2.5 rating on here. Let me start with the positive our server was super awesome and knowledgeable about beer as well as really friendly. If I were to rate the place strictly on the service it would be an easy 5 star review, however there were some things that just didn't measure up.    We found a table outside and the weather was perfect, so that was a plus. We proceeded to order a \"flight\" of beer. Which was 6 different samples of selections from the 25 plus handles that are rotated frequently (I think daily, but I could be wrong on that). Here is the first part of the reason for the 2 stars. There are 2 boards to read the selection of draughts that are being featured, and a menu that describes what each of the types of beers are for example  A \"Lager\" is..... or A \"Stout\" is..... However there is no correlation that I could decipher that would tell you what \"type\" of beer that the featured name stood for, so let's say number 22 on the board was Witte...If you are a beer rookie there was no way to know what type it was. This causes one of at least two dilemmas, you can either 1. ask the server what type of beer each of the 25 or so types are (which....\"Ain't nobody got time for that\" :)  or you can play a little \"Russian Beerlette\" and just hope for the best, at any rate there are some specific types of beer that I just do not enjoy, and I didn't want the server to have to reel off all of the specifics of each beers that was on the board. I love the idea of the constantly rotating types of draught, but they need to figure out a better delivery system for the patron. The other part of the review was based on the appetizers that we had, one of which was the pretzels. Maybe I am americanized and have been spoiled to food a certain way, but I like my pretzels soft all the way through and really doughy (if that's a word) and theirs just weren't that. The pretzels were not very moist and the selection of cheese and mustard was ok at best. I really hate giving two stars, but I gotta be honest about my experience.  Great concept, great server, poor execution....I might try again in a few months and see if they changed anything."}
{"text":"Great place: Nice selection of local brews. Really great to find a bar that doesn't sacrifice food quality. Four of us ate there and everything was excellent: guys raved about the burgers! Angel wings and avocado salad were also yum.  Only drawback was that the apple strudel could have really used a nice scoop of ice cream. Oh, well."}
{"text":"Great food highly recommend this place to lots of friends. Everyone has enjoyed it so far. I wish they were open for lunch I would eat there more often!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my review will have to be brief, as was my visit.  My lady, kid and I were in town for the Thanksgiving holiday and made plans to meet up with a friend at Angel's Trumpet (his suggestion).  We only had a little bit of time, which sucks, because I feel like we could have spent all night there.  The beer list was impressive, and featured a number of top-notch brewers that we can't get in our current hometown due to distance/distribution limitations.  I was able to select one brew I hadn't had before and one of my favorites that I can rarely get...and it was on nitro.  Good Lord, it was beautiful.  It was like angels singing...or blowing trumpets or saxophones or something.  I was pleased to learn that they rotate selections rapidly, I'm sure that if I lived nearby I would spend plenty of time there finding new beers to love.    The atmosphere was awesome, the patio area was comfortable, and the appetizers we had were quite tasty.  Though our visit was short, our experience was very positive.  I will go back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Had a red basket special (catfish poboy) and it just melted in my mouth ! And the tots were perfectly fried and the sauce was delicious. First time here, will be coming back for sure. Plus the waitor was very pleasant and informative."}
{"text":"Everything was great except the service. Hostess was unfriendly and the server even more so (Micah). Probably the most impersonal and stand offish server I've ever had. Grilled cheese was awesome. Fun ambiance. Unfortunate service."}
{"text":"The beer selection is hard to top & the freshness of all of them is amazing! You won't find crap in stock here! I had a red ale to start. Red ales are notoriously poor tasting as they are not very popular & sit too long(never fresh enough). This red ale was a game changer! Fresh, crisp & delicious. My boyfriend had a Belgian triple-also very good & fresh. We each had a burger. Mine was great & the fries were good too, just a lot to eat. His pork burger was a bit too rich for his liking, but he loved it, but his coleslaw missed the mark (fresh, but not exactly what you might expect coleslaw to be). The ambiance is nice, hipster/industrial type. I just felt it was a little less than welcoming (maybe too sterile). I will definitely come back & recommend it to anyone-especially beer lovers. Also, I can't wait for a Tuesday off to try their TV dinners!!!!"}
{"text":"I really love the food, atmosphere and service here.   Sitting at the bar is a far better experience than at the tables.  Definitely go for Tuesday night TV dinners ($7 dinner, with $3 drink)... they have never disappointed me.   Love the deserts!  Very casual and fun place to go for dinner. I highly recommend this place to anyone.    The only meal I didn't like very much was the sausage plate.  The matador sandwich is my favorite.  But if I go on a Tuesday I definitely go for the TV dinner.  Burgers are also great!  Pizza is better at other restaurants, not my favorite thing here.  This pizza is more like flat bread."}
{"text":"Wow what a refreshing establishment in downtown Phoenix. Growing up here I never was very fond of going into urban Phoenix because there was not much going on, especially for quality young people.  Angels Trumpet is the sort of place you wouldn't expect to find in Phoenix, Arizona. It feels more like a chic-contemporary atmosphere of a more progressive city, Austin, San Francisco, Seattle...but in the desert!  I enjoyed the diverse (31) options of beer on tap, including the apricot cider. The menu had its roots in pub food but with a very refreshing and eclectic twist. The kitchen and chef clearly care about providing unique and high quality food. I ordered the 810 \"sammy\" with smoked turkey, bacon, avocado mash, and onions on toasted bread. The taste was phenomenal but there is nothing worse than eating a sandwich with parts without any meat. The corners of my sandwich were unfortunately all bread which was a shame because it had such an amazing smoky smell and taste.  My friend had a gourmet grilled cheese with a unique bacon-jelly, and she loved the taste. Our server Arika was very friendly, professional, and provided a great service  Overall I would like a little more consistency in the quality and presentation of the food, but it is one of the most unique, fun, and quality ale-house/restaurants in all of Phoenix. Definitely worth the visit. I will be going back anytime I am in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"It was good. The server was really nice, but nothing spectacular from other places we've seen."}
{"text":"25+ beers on tap and none are uber mainstream!  I love discovering hidden gems in the central/downtown area and this is my latest discovery.  My mates have been raving about this place and I finally found time to grab a brew with them.  The decor is your typical modern/hipster with a twist of vintage thrown in.  The bartender that night was a lovely young lady who I recognized from Roosevelt Bar (which is now closed).  She was very knowledgeable and gave me wonderful recommendations based off of what I normally drink.    In short, this is a great place to grab a brew and reconnect with mates you haven't had time to see.  I will be here again very soon."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong by going to Angels Trumpet. The staff is knowledgeable friendly and is a great place to have a beer. Come on down I'll be sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"After hitting up the food trucks at the Phoenix Open Air Market on Wednesday we went to grab some beers and dessert at this place. We had the apple pop tart, which was pretty flipping good. They change the flavors seasonally and had just missed the pumpkin one :( They have a rotating list of craft beers on tap which was pretty neat. And our waitress told us about the great brunch they have on Sundays! I will definitely be returning to try it out."}
{"text":"I remember being very excited when they were putting this place in a few years ago. I've been a few times over the years, and am not a fan.  The food is decent and the beer is plentiful, but the place has no personalty, or if it does it's a bad one. The huge patio is boring and kind of ugly. Service is so so. There are so many interesting and unique places downtown,  but this is not one of them. I'd be content to never go back. Still waiting for an actual local brewery to show up downtown."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Good beer selection. Good food. But kind of a loud inside. I had the Churchill and it was very good."}
{"text":"6 flights of the sampler brew is the best way to go and try numerous kinds. Pork Animal burger is the best burger I've had. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and this place rocks. They have a fantastic selection of beer and the most amazing beer-battered fish tacos I have ever tried, The server was great and the ambiance is always nice."}
{"text":"Inventive food choices, fantastic beer selection, friendly fellow customers and receptive staff made this place my favorite Phoenix destination. And it does not seem touristy though located in a high traffic area."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection. Any beer geek definitely check this spot out. If your looking for a bud light and a game your taste buds might explode here. But great atmosphere and nice TVs for games. Only reason I give a 4 and not a 5 is because the bartender was a little rude and never checked on us. Good thing another bartender was more than willing to help out when need be."}
{"text":"Amazing food. One of the best pizzas I've had in a long time. The Tractor with added jalapenos is crunchy, smoky, and just so good. The rotating beer list is always a fun scavenger hunt for new beer. Solid pizzas, great burgers, and unique beers. Count me in."}
{"text":"The beer selection is great and the food is delicious.  I had the best grilled cheese sandwich that I have ever had.  The ambiance is great all around with a great patio area, if you have little kiddos."}
{"text":"Pretty solid selection of craft beers Service is weak. Prices are too high.  As a home brewer and craft beer lover I was really exited about this place opening. Their selection of draft beers is pretty good, but on all three of my visits I experienced very poor service. Each time I've taken a seat at the bar and have had to flag down the bartender to ask for a menu and ask for a another round all while there has been only a handful of people in the place. I know that they've only been open a couple of months but this place needs to fix these issues if it's going to stick around. Come off your prices at least a buck for each specific pour and offer a happy hour. You're in the wrong locale to command such high prices."}
{"text":"I need to point out how accommodating the staff was . . .  I visited ATAH after the Strong Beer Festival; as you might imagine the place was a mad-house.  That's an understatement.  In fact, the line to the restroom was almost out the door.  Anyway, we were put on a wait for seating.  After about an hour we were notified that a table was ready.  It was the worst table in the place - the one RIGHT next to the line of people waiting to use the restroom.  My comment to them was a bit gruff - \"hell no, I'm not sitting where I get to stare at drunk people's asses while I eat\" (my apologies to the staff).  They didn't blink an eye or even once get a snotty tone.  They were very professional.  They put us back in the list and we were seated at a better table as one came available.  Once seated we were treated to fabulous service and amazing food.  I'm going back for sure.  Again, ATAH Staff - my apologies for being a difficult patron.  You handled it very well!"}
{"text":"NYC prices in Phoenix? Nice idea but downtown Phoenix will continue to be second rate if this what is tolerated. Sub par customer service and food is lackluster. Been here 4 times now so I gave it more than a fair shake. You may ask why have I gone back then? My friends didn't believe me but we're all now in agreement. Another nice attempt that misses the mark in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"We have been going to Angels Trumpet since they opened. Let me tell you, this restaurant NEVER disappoints! I love getting a beer flight because, come on, they have sooooo many great options to choose from!  Every time we go, we start with the spam sliders. Oh my....so yummy! You have to try them!  Every dish we have tried, from the burgers, to the tacos to the hilarious t.v. Dinners are just really, really, really delish!!  This is a great spot for date night or out with friends. Grab a beer flight and enjoy the yummy food!!"}
{"text":"Time to toot this ale house horn at Angels & Trumpets! While the ambiance could turn the music up a notch and open the dining area up, I was still pleased with the overall experience. The Avocado salad hit the nail on my taste bud heads but the homemade pumpkin pop tarts were the cherry on top! I see only bright things in their culinary future. Definitely would love to see some mural/art on the inside!"}
{"text":"Celebrating two birthdays- the food was delish!  Meat pizza, green chili burro enchilada style and fries chicken  salad were all a amazingly! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"This place is great. They have a fantastic beer selection, there is always beers I had not tried yet. On any given day, there is typically around 25 different types of beer on tap. I prefer dark beer, like stouts and porters. They also can beers for you if you want to bring it home, called crowlers (32 oz. can). This pic is a chocolate porter called Achocalypse, definitely one of the best porters I have tried there. The food is ok. Not exactly your typical bar food, they have a good selection on the menu... I've had the Nutter, which is peanut butter, raspberry preserves, banana, marshmallow fluff & peppered bacon. Not bad at all. Definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"GO TO THIS PLACE.  Tucked away in a little residential-esque building, Angels Trumpet Ale House is the coolest new place in RoRo to grab some brews. I went here with my older brother on a Friday after work and the place was popping. Strolled through the door (whose handle is an entire broomstick, wicked cool looking) and grabbed a table by the big bay windows over looking the patio. Not quite full yet but within 20 minutes the place was full and the patio was too. People really like this place. The beer was good, I got a cider and it was very tasty. We weren't THAT hungry so we split the Meat Treat  pizza and it was BOMB. The bacon was nice and crunchy and the veggies weren't slimy or overwhleming like they tend to be on flat bread pizza.   I cannot wait to go back here, especially this fall when the patio (which overlooks dowtown PHX) is nice and cool and enjoy plenty o drinks."}
{"text":"Staff takes pride of not caring.  \"gives no ****s\"  for service. Good burrito, tacos need to be three instead of two. If you are use to  attentive wait staff, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Sat down at the exact time as the guy next to me, who was served promptly.  Had to flag down the manager to get somebody to take my drink order, and the place is only about one-third full.  Waitress, when she did come, got my order wrong.  Finally got my beer, Noche Dulce from Borderlands Brewery in Tucson.  It's a vanilla porter, and delicious.  Had a great conversation with another downtowner.  Enjoyed watching the staff serve beer flights.  Tried to go back later to take my daughter to dinner, but the kitchen closed at 10:00.  Too bad, because the menu looked interesting."}
{"text":"Good was AMAZING! My boyfriend and I went here for dinner one night while he was in town and came back for lunch the next day! Definitely get the hot mess!!!"}
{"text":"Best burger place in town!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!  I'm not a beer fan but my friends are and they are way pleased with the assortment of varieties available.  The crowd is urban hip and very attractive.  I have been several times and not had a bad experience yet!  Oh, and the French fries are to DIE for!  Mmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"This place is SO good. Found this gem on yelp and I am so happy I did. I couldn't pick between one of their popular burgers and their fish tacos. Ended up picking the tacos and they were GREAT. highly recommend."}
{"text":"Cute backyard area. Fish tacos 10 out of 10, I will be returning, honestly some of the best in the valley. Calling it a house made \"poptart\" does it a disservice, and I love poptarts. Flavor at the time was banana walnut, a la mode, and I'd likely hand over my first born for another. Needless to say, you should save room for dessert. Beef burger was beautiful looking but surprisingly bland despite the trimmings, we even got it with the egg."}
{"text":"31 different types of crafts on tap + some wines + great food what more can you ask for! Been here twice in less than a month, and will be def going back. Totally work a try :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is quite possibly my all time favorite.  Been coming here since they opened,  lots of great beer and the food is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I don't get it. OK the beer selection is great, beer is good. The place was packed when we were there, full, busy... The service was good, no wait at all, attentive. No issue there. But the food, is mediocrity a trend downtown Phoenix? The Chet was dry, untasty and spicy enough so you can't feel what you are eating, the avocado salad had a slice of avocado laying on dry tasteless greens. Just not good. Go for a beer with friends, yes. Go grab a bite and enjoy beer, no. Loved the setting though, great job on that. Went there with my date, wrong choice."}
{"text":"Love it. Hip indoor-outdoor bar/restaurant in downtown with loads of seating, 31 beers on tap and a good food menu.  The building is huge and its got a great modern feel to it with exposed brick and brushed concrete floors. There are lots of windows, so it feels nice and bright on the inside. There's a huge bar and loads of tables and hightops, but even late afternoon on Saturday this place was packed.  The outdoor area is fun, with Adirondack chairs and Bags, and an awesome view of downtown. And the outdoor patio area is dog-friendly! Next time we'll be bringing the pups!  With 31 beers on tap you're spoiled for choice. And they rotate the beers with some local and national microbrews, so its easy to try something different.   The menu is stocked with, interesting appetizers (spam sliders!), big hearty sandwiches and cheesy flatbread pizzas.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Cobra Bar & Angels Trumpet combo is hard to beat.  The Big Guppy fish tacos are the best fish tacos I've ever had.  Beer selection is endless.  The layout is nice, but can feel cluttered. Side dishes are a bit stingy too (I'm Korean, so I have higher expectations when it comes to side dishes).  The Big Guppy fish tacos are the best fish tacos I've ever had AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN."}
{"text":"This place has a really chill, almost a hipster feel to the place (normal for downtown PHX).  All the servers are \"cool\" and no one is in a big hurry.  We split this steak sandwich with fries and we also split a flight of 6 beers to get an idea of what we'd order as our \"real\" drink.  I ended up ordering the Old Chub (Scottish Ale) and it was dark and amaze balls.  I enjoyed the beer and the food was average but definitely homemade so I would say the quality is good (a little bland but nbd) instead of ketchup we got some tomato blend.  I personally would have just enjoyed the ketchup.  Someone dropped a glass and I swear they swept for like 20 minutes (hipster slow) The bathrooms are unisex and clean BUT---- it smelt like piss in there..... I dunno I think the urinal might be the culprit..  There are 31 craft beers on tap and I am a huge fan of craft beers."}
{"text":"Solid selection of beers on tap, and a great patio! Food...haven't loved any of the things i've tried (pizza, smoked chicken legs, grilled cheese)."}
{"text":"Terrible service on Saturday 2/13 although the restaurant wasn't full. The beer was ok, food was ok. But we will not be back. Literally- we waited 15 minutes for the server to even acknowledge us. As more people joined our party, they also waited 15 minutes or more for him to return.  Also, the server was kind in splitting the check but then he did not return exact change... I did not appreciate this."}
{"text":"So far, so good... Friendly staff, clean... Beer for days... Pretzel (rolls) are tasty!! Custom beer flight.... Can't wait to come back and drink my way through the rotating board. Unassuming from the outside but the funs through the door... Get on in here!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, large selection of draft beers, will definitely be back. You can't go wrong with the Big Guppy or the Brewlee Beef Burger . This is definitely the place to go if you're downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and every time it's a hit....from the great selection in beers to the food. Everything is great.  We love the fact that it's always a different list of beers. Their hamburgers and fish tacos are delicious!  Their homemade pop tarts are great too...sometimes, that is all we have (and beer too, of course). Great laid back atmosphere, a great place to come hang out with friends or to have a date night. Love it!"}
{"text":"If I could give a negative star I would. I have been three times and all three times the service was horrible. Tonight we walked out after not being acknowledged for over 15 minutes. I wish I could say the bartenders were hustling but they were actually chatting amongst themselves instead of looking for eager patrons.  Makes me very sad considering all of the great beers they bring in.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"The animal burger and the fish tacos are amazing!!! Lots of beer choices but I'm there for the burgers! The putine is pretty good too."}
{"text":"A great spot for beer lovers! So many beers to choose from and you can make your own sampler."}
{"text":"I have only been here when it is really busy. I have been happy every time. The food is good and you can't beat their crazy selection. Great place."}
{"text":"Great food, service & atmosphere! I brought my in laws & out of town guests tonight, we all had a wonderful time! Good variety of beer, outdoor seating while we waited for a table was perfect, very comfortable. The service was excellent; knowledgable, accommodating & friendly staff! The food.... Wow.. Worth writing a review about! as a group we chose everything from the hot wings to sausage plate for apps. Main course: grilled cheese, burrito, pizza, fish tacos & cheeseburger! All items were rated A+ by my family! I felt like a hero bringing them here! This is not your average bar food, the flavors, seasoning & creativity in each meal were great! My personal fav: Churchill grilled cheese w/ bacon jam. Yum.  Highly recommended for any gathering! :) we will be back!"}
{"text":"31 taps and probably the best mix in Phoenix. Food was fresh and delicious. Wings are oven baked, awesome! The big guppy, fish tacos were breaded with the right consistency and the fish was fresh. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Beer and Pop Tarts! That's all.  Well, ok the other food is good but not great. The beer selection is impressive with a wide enough variety to offer something for everyone. Patio is nice but just a bit on the urban sparse side. Overall, a great place to compliment a casual evening out."}
{"text":"terrible first experience! Dirty kitchen crew outside smoking in an apron I could see the filth from where we parked a block away. No one greeted us while we wondered around trying to figure the place out, as several employees walked past us some even making eye contact. After figuring out it was seat yourself, again first time in, we waited for a very long time for service. Contemplated going elsewhere, decided to stay and then figured out what we were going to order for both appetizer and lunch and read most of the beers on the board...still no server! Decided to go to Pita Jungle for lunch where we had a great time, great food and above all great service!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. We went with friends a while back and everyone had a good time. Liked the set up, the atmosphere, ect. My husband and I split a few appetizers and a sandwich because we always try a bunch of things on our first visit somewhere. Nothing was a let down; we liked all of it and that's saying a lot from my picky husband. We went while I was pregnant and I was super bummed I couldn't try any of the beers after I saw the huge selection. My husband got a flight though and I thought it was clever how the glasses are served in cupcake/muffin tins. I've been really wanting to go back since and try some of the beers myself and the homemade pop tarts."}
{"text":"Stood there with mouth agape perusing the chalkboard again, again and again.   The pressure to choose the right beer... no, make that the perfect beer!  Do I feel like a larger today? (yes)  IPA (yes) Amber (yes)  Stout (yes).  With thirty some craft beers and wines on tap, beer drinkers are frozen with indecision which probably is annoying for the bartender.   You just can't go wrong here --  you just can't.  The problem is both good and bad: the kegs are constantly rotated so you can never develop an affinity for a favorite beer (bad) but you're always discovering new beers (the good).  I never met a beer I didn't like.  Any rate, I stopped in for lunch and a beer.   Today, I ordered the Big Guppy tacos and wow!  4 good size strips of beer battered cod in two tacos with slaw, guac, salsa and some killer beans!  With food though, you can establish a favorite and the BIG GUPPY is now my favorite and comes highly recommended!  Then again, the Wild BLT wrap is  a hard one to kick to the curb.     Oh yea, that one beer become 4 or 5 as conversations at the bar are easy to start and difficult to end -- especially with all that good beer flowing!  Kind of reminds me of the public houses back in the midwest -- (those with fish fry fridays!)"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place.  I'm a big fan of German, Irish, and Belgian beers so I was convinced that I would really enjoy my experience here.  I came with my wife and a few friends and decided to try the beer flight.  Unfortunately most of my beer choices were unavailable.  How annoying.    On top of that the service was sporadic.  Ordering took a really long time because the cranky server was always buzzing by our table, but never stopping by.  The beers I ended up trying were just so so.  Another problem with Angels is that I actually enjoy talking to people, which at the decibel level maintained in the ale house is pretty much impossible.  Due to the awful service I chose to decrease the tip for the server.  Probably to about 10 percent, which considering the service was generous.  The server then had the hutzpah to follow me out and ask me if I had a problem with the service and ask for more money.  I complained to management about this, but they did nothing. Suffice to say, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Amazing place, no signage so you might miss it. It's nice and open inside, great selection of craft beer and the food is to die for. Betsie Boop was our waitress she provided great service and recommended the Brûlée Burger, hands down the best burger I have ever had. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The rotating tap may be the best part of this place. They never are low on beer and if one runs out, it is always replaced with something just as yummy but maybe a different style, so your pilsner you had an hour ago may have become a Stout. If you like or well, love beer and want to try more? go no further. I really like the layout of the beer wall and the choices seem endless and they always let you sample, cheers to that."}
{"text":"Normally I go here on Tuesday for the special they run with the TV dinner. This time I went on a Thursday for something different. The food, as always, was amazing. Get a flight of beer, having to choose from 30 craft beer is hard and the flight lets you try lots at once. The service is always friendly and fast.  Love this place and you will"}
{"text":"FOOD People are griping about the creative license the owners took with the names of their food, but my issue is over the fact that it is almost always tepid. I don't know if it's the server's fault or the cook(s) not timing things correctly but I don't think I've ever had a sandwich/burger that seemed freshly cooked.  Two or three weeks back, I dined with a friend and he ordered one of the \"specials\"- some sort of veggie sandwich that had decent ingredients but the different flavors just didn't go well together. I don't think he even ate half of it.  As a heads up, they make their own 'house' ketchup and if you don't like the taste, you are SOL since they don't have store-bought ketchup.  BEER Maybe people love how often they rotate their beers but I'm not made of money and can't hit up their place every 2-3 nights for their $6+ beer. I'm also not really a fan of how their beer menu is presented- the bar area doesn't need to be that crowded. If they had a weekly rotation, they could print out weekly beer menus. My favorite bar in IL did this and it worked out just fine. Maybe learn how much beer to order or be okay with not having 31 'flavors' at all times?  Also, people rave about how amazing having flights are (really?), but I don't think it's a really good deal. The pours for the flights are about as much as the pours for a sample- if you're with at least one other person and you both get 3 samples, BAM! a free 'flight.' Increase the pours on your flights, or decrease the pours on your samples, otherwise it is infinitely cheaper to keep saying \"Can I have a sample of X, please?\"  SERVICE Not consistent.  I'm not sure how many have actual beer knowledge but I'm betting they use the 'beer list' as a crutch. I get why they have the beer list as I'm sure they don't want to answer annoying questions over and over but this is the ONLY place I've been to that does this and I would honestly prefer a beer menu and use google if the server can't answer my beer question.  OTHER I've been here a handful of times; twice when it was really busy (2nd night they opened and the grand opening). What you'll take-away from your experience is how incredibly LOUD it is inside, whether they're crowded or not. They need to invest in some dampeners or something, and considering how much they charge for their beers ($6 is the average, a few $5, rounded out with $7 and up), I'm sure they can afford it.  While I like the idea of their TV dinner night, I went once and the experience was lackluster. It's on the patio and the screen is TINY. Unless you're in the first 'row' or two of tables, you won't get a good viewing experience. In addition, you can't hear anything. I thought they'd have it streaming on speakers or something, but no. So if you're expecting to watch a movie, expect to be ignoring it instead.  I love their mural. It's maybe my 2nd favorite in PHX (after the 'illegal alien' sombrero one on Calle 16, also by Lalo Cota).  They don't currently have a happy hour but they do have a 'Ladies Night' on Wednesday. $1 off drafts.  They don't allow smoking on the patio. However, their patio is dog-friendly although I've yet to bring my dog since I live walking distance to the Main Ingredient (they have all day happy hour on Sundays and Mondays! $2.50 drafts, folks)  I expect I'll bump my review up to **** stars eventually since I really like the appearance of the place and the beers they bring in. Maybe after I get a hot sandwich?"}
{"text":"Took the wife on the evening date. Ordered the outlaw bun, spam sliders and angel wings. All mediocre at best. The wings were exceptionally dry almost burnt. Despite the average food. Atmosphere and presentation was great. I love the setting of angels trumpet but the food probably only taste good after youve downed a few beers from thier awesome bar and draft selection."}
{"text":"Some serious love went into this place and you can feel it.  Huge outdoor patio to swill some good brews (along with a nice, simple, sleek inside space).   Go...drink...be happy and support the local folks who played the part of Santa Claus and stuck this awesome gift under our collective Phx Xmas tree.  The evolution of downtown Phx continues.  BOOM."}
{"text":"GREAT food, great service, great beer selection.  We had a lot of fun and, if i lived here, would totally come here all the time.  Definitely the spot if you like better quality food and craft beer.  Not too expensive either... about $30 bucks for 2 beers, an an entree and an appetizer."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Excellent beer!  Good prices!  Full of good looking but not pretentious people!  A home run on what an ale house should be...."}
{"text":"Angels Trumpet is a great spot to grab a drink with friends and kick off a night downtown. Table service is sometimes a bit slow, but they have a huge selection of rotating drafts, and every Tuesday they do a TV Dinner that gets you a full meal including dessert for roughly $8. They are able to accommodate large parties as long as they have a heads up, and have been the landing spot for the No Pants Light Rail Ride the past few years. Go!"}
{"text":"Despite the reputation that downtown Phoenix is an afterthought for going out, Angels Trumpet is a refreshing reminder that the downtown area is actually vibrant and full of choices. The revolving draught selection makes each visit unique. On top of that, the kitchen provides both fun (TV dinners, anyone?) and trendy takes on traditional dishes.  The big sell to AngelsTrumpet is the thirty ever-changing beer options. As soon as a keg is tapped, a new and often drastically different brew replaces it. I have some bars to go to for \"the usual\" and I have Angels Trumpet to explore lesser known breweries.  I have on multiple occasions also gone with the beer flight. Given the vastness of the beer board and my own unfamiliarity with smaller breweries, for a very reasonable price you can order six three-ounce beers.   The beer and atmosphere speak for themselves. Have a drink at the bar, at the table, or outside on an Adirondack chair. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Wine on tap... All California.  Can I get an AZ option?  Beer selection on fleek.  Big guppy tacos- beyond delicious!  Nice crispy hot fish with a spicy Slaw served on the side.    Saturday night at 10:30pm we sat at the bar and enjoyed the casual ambience. A tad noisy but appropriate for the time & setting.  Walking distance from the Nash & across the street from Film Bar."}
{"text":"i was torn about this one...we were looking forward to the craft beers and wines on tap. i was underwhelmed by the wines. i was also surprised that they served both the malbec and the imperial stout cold instead of room temp... the salads we had (avocado and cobb) were awesome...my friend was underwhelmed by his flatbread pizza...found the chicken dry...it was fun to try something new, but next time, we'll probably try another new place rather than returning here...another thing, it is wicked LOUD in the restaurant...the acoustics are out of control. you're far better off sitting outside..."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection, location and ambiance. Food is not the best but that's not what this spot is focused on."}
{"text":"My hotel recommended Angels Trumpet because most restaurants were closed for the night.  But they are open til midnight.   Staff was friendly, they had a big beer and wine selection.  And my burger was one of the best I've had all year!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection.  The wings and sauce were out of this world.  Cool restaurant.  Loud inside on a busy night."}
{"text":"Great food, enormous beer and wine selection. Wings here are amazing, but also like the fish tacos and pretzel buns (rolls?). Really into sour beers right now and they usually have one (sometimes two!) on tap. Alway fun to check them out. Service can sometimes be great and other times slow. Thought its typically only slow during the usual busy crowd times (Fri/Sat night) and week day evenings are much, much better.   Love the huge patio!"}
{"text":"Hmm. Really struggling to decide what to rate this place. That said, here are the highlights.  The building is really cool. Open concept with wood, tile, and brick. The beer selection is large and rotates during the night. Crowd as good as well. Pretty crowded.  Taking all that into consideration here are the lowlights.   The staff does not seem to be very knowledgeable about the beers they serve. Our waitress said that one of our choices was good choice. When we asked what was good about the beer she followed up \"I am not sure. I have not actually tasted that beer\". Just odd. Also, the system by which the update the beer list is a bit slow. We asked about a few beers. They turned out to be out of them.   All in all, I would definitely go back. Hopefully, they get the kinks worked out of the system."}
{"text":"Food was Ahmazinggg!!' Britney our server was awesome! Came for a quick trip visit and love trying new places! Found it on Yelp and love it! Great atmosphere  we had the summer special shrimp scampi flatbread so refreshing light and tasted phenomenal! Va-va-verde brisket tacos so flavorful, homemade chicharones. Best was the wings couldn't help ourself they were a perfect blend of sweet and spicy. Had two beers and they were great! My favorite was the homemade poptart!"}
{"text":"Fantastic beer selection - the bartenders will make great recommendations and let you sample any beers on tap. I had the va-va-verde with brisket and it was good bar food in a great atmosphere. Will definitely go back when in town"}
{"text":"The food was very good.  I've been there twice and had the Matador (roast beef sandwich) and the paisano pizza.  Both were fantastic.  The beer selection is amazing!  A chalkboard covering an entire wall behind the bar lists the current offerings.  About 32 total and I've tried 12 so far.  Get the flight of six samples of your choice.  They are busy so be prepared to grab a beer and wait for a table.  But the wait times really aren't too bad.  I'll be making this place a regular stop."}
{"text":"A Haiku Review of Angels Trumpet Ale House:  Attention beer nerds: This is your official bar. I'll see you there soon."}
{"text":"Great place to get your drink on!  Great outdoor seating and some badass choices of beer. B"}
{"text":"I went back - this place consistently under scores.  No knowledge of beer from the waitstaff.  Takes 15 minutes to realize the beer you ordered is tapped out.  Busch League.  Patio still lacks lighting.  I won't be back sober.   Look:  Place is well done and I liked the clean look to the taps and backsplash.  Very loud, to the point where you're shouting to the person across the table.  Once the weather improves, opening the doors to the patio will help the noise.  Does this place have lights out on the patio or was it closed?  People want to sit outside at night if the weather is reasonable.  Beer:  Overpriced.  Local brews (4 Peaks and Lumberyard) were $6/pint while everything else was ~$7-9.  Yes, craft beer is more expensive but not everyone is willing to pay that much for a few beers.   Food:  Very tasty, diverse and I thought they could even increase prices.  The 810 was great.  Overall:  I've been looking forward to this place opening for a year now and was let down.  I'll go back in a few weeks, hopefully the bugs are worked out.  If they don't improve, I'll just buy a 6 pack of good beer for $10 and sit on my patio, which has lights.   Also, not sure if they have a happy hour but they need one."}
{"text":"OMG - I hate writing this review for I've heard so much about this place!  We've been meaning to check out this place since it opened especially since the Roosevelt had closed.  We had family visiting over the long Columbus Day holiday and needed a night out with just the two of us especially since it was my birthday!  We even left Grandpa at home to try this place by ourselves!  When we arrived we walked into a \"please seat yourself sign.\"  Hard to \"seat yourself\" when the place is packed.  We finally was offered a table at the back per a group who graciously gave up their table for friends who were a no show.  This was a table with a perfect window view of behind the scenes of the keg taps.  We waited about 12 minutes or so before a \"waiter\" felt bad for us to ask if we had ordered yet.  We asked for a drink menu only to be told we should have either looked at it on the way in or take a step outside to see it!  We told him what we wanted to drink and he said he would do the best to match our needs.  We get our drinks and the menu looked good and we figured out what we wanted to order but then another 15 minutes went by without any waiter attention and we decided to head off to another local place that we knew we would get better service.  We were forced to simply leave a $10 bill on the table for no one every came back to check on us and we promptly made our way to the door!!!!  I don't think we will be making our way back here anytime soon, we really should give this place a 1/2 star but we liked what they did with the place ;o)."}
{"text":"Smoky wings, Outlaw burger, grilled cheese, ginger beer and a poptart were all great choices!Nice portion sizes and great covered open air sitting. Would definitely return. Husband's only complaint was No Titos! (But this is an ale house!)"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!  We first ordered \"the mess\" which is basically poutine and so delicious! They definitely do not skimp on the portion size. We could barely finish half of it, but so good  My husband ordered fish tacos as an entree which he loved and I ordered the Churchill with bacon and a side salad. Delicious! Our server was Jake (name on ticket at about 7:45-9pm on Friday 8/18). He was so friendly and attentive and I'd love to have him every time we come back, he made the first experience for us memorable. I LOVE friendly staff (I was a waitress for 5 years).  Food arrived very quickly and was just like we ordered. Very cool place that I felt was non- judgmental... Come as you are. Love this place! We will back soon"}
{"text":"One of the newest places in town and it's already one of the best.  The beer selection is most impressive and the largest I have seen in Phoenix.  Some local, some independent brew and lots from Germany and Belgium.  I'm told the selection will always change a bit.  When one keg runs empty it will be replaced in back with a different selection on hand.  Expect to see some variance each visit.  The food menu boasted some interesting selections and they've made an effort to put unique selections or spins on traditional bar fare.  I tried the Spam sliders.  They were okay but that's all on me.  I learned I did not care for Spam too much.  Went for something new and wasn't too pleased but I live and learn.  I know there are items on the menu I would surely enjoy.  Service was great: quick and friendly.  To top it off, Angels Trumpet Ale House sells growlers!  Awesome.  Come in and enjoy and leave with a growler of your favorite beer.  Keep in mind the growler selection may not be open to everything on the menu.  Located across the street from FilmBar, this is in a great location and can easily be incorporated into a fun night out.    Angels Trumpet Ale House will become one of my regular haunts along with FilmBar and Revolver Records."}
{"text":"I went here opening day late afternoon, met up with some fellow beer freaks. Overall I'm pleased! Building marking signage is on the south side wall, and parking is available in the dirt lot next to that wall as well as limited parking up front. Furniture is simple butcherblock tables, well laid out. The beer bar has a large chalkboard above it, 31 taps and several wines. Music is there, but not loud at all. Room acoustics might use some work, it gets a little loud in there but hey what do you expect with a house full of yapping beer freaks?!   Good variety of beers, offering the major breweries we already know such as Deschutes, Odell, Warsteiner (Dunkel), Epic, Sam Adams (a new style!), New Belgium, Green Flash, and more. Kegs blow all the time and something different is put on. Beers are priced $6,7,8. Snifter served for high ABV beers, PROPER TALL PINT glass for regulars and tulips for Beligian styles. No American \"pint\" glasses which actually serve 12 oz. plus head, those are for ice water.   **** INSIDE SKINNY:   The place has an outdoor patio out back, and now that the weather is getting cooler IT'S SUPER NICE OUT THERE for sunset and after. In fact it's really nice for a date with a candle on the table. Get one on the rear edge of the patio rather than near the door, it's quieter.  Sampler flights are available for a fair deal! Pick 6, write the tap numbers on the paper, and they'll be delivered in a muffin tray oriented with the paper!   So now on to the food! Yeah get ready.  The menu is gourmet scrumptious, and I CANNOT WAIT to try some of those things! These dishes have flavor combinations that will blow your mind just by reading them, and the choice WILL be difficult. You'll just have to convince yourself you'll try the other dish next time.  My recommendations:   The Chet: ($8.50) - Tortilla stuffed with fries, chorizo, black beans, roasted corn,  grilled chile peppers, chihuahua cheese, adobo sauce and crema. I saw this one, nice grill marks on the tortilla. SPICY.  The 810: (sammy,$8.50) Shaved smoked turkey, peppered bacon, avocado mash, pickled red onions, adobo sauce, side of pickled jalapeno long slices. Choice of side - I recommend the fries, they're flavorful and perfectly done.  Meat Treat Pizza: ($10) 10\" Flatbread pizza with peperoni, sausage, smoked bacon, LEEKS!!!, smoked mozz, roasted tomato sauce. Saw this one, the toppings just POP at you! Nice size too!  Warm Sausage Platter: ($10) Wild game!! Brat! Chorizo! with mustards and relishes. This comes out and it's SPECTACULAR.  Haven't had the burgers, but they look and smell scrumptious. My friend had the Southwest Burger.  I guess you can see what flavors I like, haha. Leeks for me ANYWHERE are a pleasant surprise as well.  Based on the most recent visit, I now upgrade to FIVE STARS! Very attentive and accurate service. My friend's iced tea was never neglected, and our large party was checked on every so often. (Gratuity added automatically for larger parties. 6 or more?)  So.... give this place a try, I think you'll be happy. After work for dinner would seem to be the best time before it gets too packed.  Nevermind Hungry Monk, EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Fun spot!   Tractor pizza is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, nice list of beers, and some tasty food.  I got the guppy tacos, and they were great.  Two huge fish tacos, cooked perfectly.  I will definitely return next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My dad picked this place cause of its variety of beers. I wasn't expecting much cause I'm not big on beer. I was pleasantly surprised... their food was delicious. My dad had the wings and I had their Farm Flatbread and homemade strawberry poptart for dessert and it was all scrumptious. Only down side is they have a small parking lot and I'm not familiar enough with the city to know any close parking lots. So worth trying to find a spot to check this place out though."}
{"text":"Great food great beer, service is a little slow at least when I usually go which is late so maybe it is not like that all the time. It has an outdoor space that has great atmosphere. I usually get a flight of beer because they have so many. Servers are very educated on the beers they offer. I have had quiet a few of their dishes and don't really favor one over the others everything is really good and has a slight variance to what you would usually find in the exact same item elsewhere."}
{"text":"Can be a very loud atmosphere, but absolutely amazing selection of beer and the food is awesome.  Tried some very hard to find and some amazing beer here.  The best part of this place though is not something I would normally try; spam sliders. Absolutely amazing and cheap. Normally go in with some buddies, get some beer and sliders and it's normally a completely reasonable tab at the end of the night."}
{"text":"Saw this place listed in the AZ Republic as one of the ten best new places in 2012 and decided to check it out.  We sat at the bar and had a flight of misc brews.  Thought that was fun. Some we liked, others not so much. There is a great selection and I would like to return.  The atmosphere is upbeat and simple. Loved the keg pendant lighting along a row of tables and the patio. The place was busy on a Wednesday night, most patrons in their 20's/30's. The location is ideal. The menu was eclectic. The recommended Mastadon sandwich was boring although the fries a winner. The bison hot dog was delicious although the accompanying coleslaw a miss.  It was pretty on the plate with craisins and feta but dry in the mouth with no dressing or herbs. Next time we will enjoy a few beers and skip the food."}
{"text":"I live within spitting distance of this place and I love it. It's just a great place to come, drink some strange beer, eat some unique food and chat. The staff is always extremely competent and knowledgeable about beer, though they don't small-talk much as the place is almost always packed! The owners are consistently there working along side their staff, and they take a lot of time to speak with regulars and make sure the service is on-point. The husband/wife team run a tight ship and their love of this business definitely shines through.   If you ask me, the only problem with the place is that the inside chairs are pretty uncomfortable, but I usually sit at the bar so it doesn't really matter.   This is the type of business that helps a city grow and gain character. A beautiful, clean, professional place with good service at a great price. I'll always be coming back."}
{"text":"NEVER GO HERE! WAITED AN HOUR TO BE SERVED! SNOOTY WAITER!  So my last review, though strongly worded, was pulled down by Yelp. When I inquired why, no one responded so I am reposting this review because I value your time and money just like I do my own.  I arrived at Angel's Trumpet at 10pm to meet friends. I am always leery of new places my friends pick. They just show up without checking reviews or they listen to bad reviewers who rave about the place. Angel's Trumpet was bad except for the Beer selection which is exciting.   After ordering my first two beers at the bar the waiter showed up and asked what I wanted at 11:00pm! An hour after I got there. When I said I was starving and wanted food I was informed that the kitchen was closed. I was busy socializing with fellow medical school classmates that I have never been out with (we call it networking since these will be my colleagues) to notice the time so when the waiter (and that's what he made me do...wait) said the kitchen was closed I was shocked to see an hour went pass. I tried to order a round of shots and was told they do not have liquor. I tried to order a glass of wine and was told that they do not have wine. I tried to order a beer and was told they were closing in 15 minutes. I asked for a beer menu and was told that they do not have menus. WHAT DO YOU HAVE! I was informed that I had to go up to the bar and read the big chalk board behind the bar for the beer selection. I pointed out, if I have to go to the bar to read the beer selection then why would I bother coming back to order through you when the bartender is right there in front of me!  I grew up in the restaurant business so I know circumstances are all based on timing. I saw the four star rating this place has so clearly many people like this place and have very good experiences. Maybe it was bad timing, but for me the waiter was an HOUR LATE, THERE WAS NO MENU, AND I WAS DENIED EVERYTHING I ASKED FOR FROM THE WAITER. To make it even worse the waiter copped an attitude because he is bad at his job. I have bad mouthed this place for a month now and I will continue to bad mouth this place to everyone I meet. Having Yelp pull down my review just angers me even more and I will now post on every site I can think of in the near future.  I never saw but one waiter maybe two that night. Way too little for such a big place.   IF YOU VALUE YOUR TIME AND MONEY STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times, and now feel compelled to write a quick review.  Visit #1: About a year ago, we were checking out a \"new\" place in our neighborhood. Beer was great, service was so-so, food was not good. The ambience was loud and lively, super hipster-friendly, and they have cool wooden tables. Nice, we thought; but the food sucks.  Visit #2: Gave it a second shot, figured we ordered wrong. Nope. Food sucked again. I like good pub food, and I like to try interesting combos like bacon & pesto, things marinated in beer, and gamey appetizers like buffalo meat or venison something or other. They have all these things, and we didn't like any. We ordered a few items, and the waiter said they were out of several ingredients b/c they were changing their menu. Place was still packed, beer flight was interesting.   Visit #3: We saw some killer pics online of their \"tv dinners\" and succumbed to our boredom and gave this place another try. Maybe the new menu was better, or they got a different chef or something. Nope. Food sucked again, and waiter was dull and silent. That's a grand total of around 4 appetizers, 8 entrees, and about a six-pack worth of crafty beers. Nothing great here food wise.   Tips: Stick to just getting beer. They have no ketchup, only a tomato-paste thing for your fries/tots. Wait staff looked like they would rather be across the street at Filmbar."}
{"text":"Yet another reason to spend time in downtown Phoenix.  As a 20+ year Phoenix resident, I never thought I'd want to spend fun time in downtown, but that's changed.  Many great places to go, and Angels Trumpet is at the top of that list.  One of the best beer selections in the Phoenix area.  Funky vibe, good service.  Food is good, but not great - otherwise I'd give it a try.  Once you go - you'll come back often."}
{"text":"Great place to go for some amazing food and a huge craft beer selection. I have been multiple times and I am never disappointed. They have great pizzas, sandwiches, burgers and a really nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"AWESOME! Food is great had a burger and flatbread, beer selection is great and the ambience is the best! My new favorite place! Next time I'll bring home a growler full of good brew! Everyone needs to go there!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a dinner at Angel's Trumpet for ~15 friends to celebrate our elopement. We came in at 2pm on a Sunday. It is an awesome space. Perfect open-air seating and spacious layout. As soon as we got there, the manager immediately started putting a row of tables together for us on their patio. Our server, Brendan, was clearly knowledgeable about the beers (noting their alcohol contents, nuanced flavors/characteristics, pairings) and provided polite and timely service. Our food was delicious! Brendan also gave my husband and I a FREE and absolutely scrumptious homemade pop-tart: chocolate cherry, so GOOD. I will let my photos speak for themselves. My *ONLY* complaint is that it was really tough to find an updated menu online. Their business website needs work. Other than that, I had a wonderful experience. Keep up the good work, Angel's Trumpet!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Simple decor and casual. Love the 80s music! The Spuds Taqitos were amazing! I'm vegetarian and found plenty to eat. I give it 4 instead of 5 stars because they had the patio doors open, and we had to swat the fly's away. That sucked. Our server was great and attentive. We will come back!"}
{"text":"Overall I give it a 5-Star. Food, Service, atmosphere, etc.Went in on a Thursday night (first time). Husband had the chicken sandwich and loved it. (he can't stop talking about it). I had the fish tacos. So good!. Trendy and a fun place to hangout. As the early evening went on, the place got really busy. I would say after 7, there may be a wait for a table. When we're back in Phoenix, we'll definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"Mat and Sharry Engelhorn have a big hit on their hands. Angel's Trumpet Ale House, so named because of the meaning of their last name and their passion for all things craft beer, is my new favorite place.  Service: Generally speaking, opening nights are fraught with disaster, poor service, and mediocre food. Not so with AT, everything was as amazing as I would expect it to be when the place wasn't jam packed with people. Our server was pleasant, pretty speedy, and explained a few details to us. She was in a hurry, but she didn't hurry us, and that's a really good thing.  5 stars for service.  Food: The FOOD! Oh yes the food was incredible.   I can think of no greater sin than soggy wings, but these wings were crispy and tender, with an incredible spicy buffalo sauce, and a delicious bleu cheese dressing. Instead of throwing a few carrot and celery stalks on the plate, they were made into a salad with a few radishes for spice and color. Let me say again, the wings are AMAZING.    My honey ordered the pizza with peppered bacon, sausage, pepperoni, and leeks - it was crispy, just enough cheese and sauce without being overwhelming, and the ingredients were amazingly high quality. I ordered the Southwest burger, and it was incredible. I love that you get to choose your protein - I chose beef, and the beef patty was moist and perfectly cooked/seasoned. My only \"complaint\" is that I wanted MORE Adobo sauce for a bigger kick, and maybe a bit more cheese, but those are easy modifications to make next time around. The burger bun was light and delicious, with perfect flavor to compliment the patty and toppings.   They also have featured seasonal dishes on the chalk wall as you walk in, and they sound absolutely incredible.  Dessert was fantastic and a fun play on childhood treats. We ordered the seasonal pop tart which was strawberry rhubarb, and it was delicious. The filling wasn't sickening sweet like a normal pop tart, and it was spread between layers of what looked to be a modified puff pastry or phyllo dough. The top was drizzled with a fantastic thin frosting, and finished with sprinkles of pink sugar for a playful and crunchy touch.  5 stars for food!  Beer: Their beer selection on tap is magnificent. So many beers I know and love, and many that I had never tried/heard of before. I tried two new IPA's and they were both splendid. The pour was great both times - one in a pint and one in a tulip, the head was perfectly poured with just the right amount and appropriately sized bubbles. Their beer folks know their stuff. 5 stars for beer!  Atmosphere: I loved walking up and into ATAH. The slump block building reminds me of my childhood home, and their metal grate dividers outside are genius and rustic. The inside perfectly blends the beauty of the wood rafters and block walls with bright colors, natural wood chairs and tables, concrete bar top, and tile backsplash. And you can't miss the massive amount of windows to let in the sun and the gorgeous sunset views. It was a true pleasure to take part in the best time of Arizona summers at this amazing pub. Oh, and I love that they have three unisex bathrooms, it is a nice relief from the standard multiple stall setup that precludes you from privacy in your most private moments.  5 stars for atmosphere  So that's 5 stars all around, and I only expect it to get better with age. I'm going back tonight, and maybe tomorrow, and definitely Sunday. I'll be here a lot., you should definitely try it."}
{"text":"Comfortable place, lovely outside tables, great for groups (esp groups who love craft beer!)  Our server seemed rushed, but all our orders were fine- their version of fish tacos (called the guppy i think) was crispy & hearty.  the ole fashion with grilled chicken was solid- a bit on the dry side, but it hit the spot.  the homemade poptarts are a fun thing to end the meal with- i took mine to go, just because i was charmed by the idea but we needed to get going- but hot with ice cream they would have been divine!  oh well, there is always next time- i'm sure we will be returning esp when any beer lovers come to town!  it would be easy to spend a whole sunday here, drinking, nibbling and talking!"}
{"text":"We waited over an hour to get seated with a server that seemed completely annoyed that we were there. It's really sad that the service was so awful and unfriendly because the food was actually very good. I'm not sure I will be back though for some server who's job it is to enhance my dining experience, to roll her eyes and be \"annoyed\" by me. No thanks!"}
{"text":"Updated Review (5 stars): Been here several times and it's earned 5 stars by now.  We've never had a bad meal here...in fact, the food is always top notch, service is good, environment exactly what we expect.  People we've gone with have mentioned that they like their beer (we still don't drink the stuff).  The Matador is always a staple and the vegetarian taquitos are great (we're not vegetarian).  We've also had the tacos and one of the other burgers.  Old Review (4 stars): This review is coming from people who don't drink beer. But we love the food! Have been here twice, and both times the food has been awesome. Big, quality hamburgers and brisket and the seasoning on the fries is great. Plus, who doesn't love homemade ketchup? We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This has just become one of my favorite Ale House's/Pub's not just in Phoenix but in the world!  It's got a great vibe right in the middle of Phoenix's emerging Central City area with lot's of good beers on tap and great food - We visited last on First Friday and were expecting it to be crowded when we got there around 5 pm but it wasn't too bad - It did get busy later around 7 when we left though - Need to go back to try more of the food - excellent and well priced!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed with the service. Small blonde hostess had a face that something piss her off! We sat next to entrance and every time someone came in she was not smiling just blank stare. Our server was also such a disappointment she look like she can careless if we got helped or not. The only reason I give this place two stars is because the guy with long blonde hair was super nice and attentive and I think he was the busser. So sad this place has the worst service it has a lot of potential to be great!"}
{"text":"Don't know anything about the food.   The drinks are awesome! I would recommend this place to anyone. Their craft beer selection is outstanding. The enviroment during happy  hour and evening is great! It is walking distance to downtown and across the street from Phoenix downtown market."}
{"text":"We arrived at 5:30 on a Friday and it was not as busy as expected, given that it is also March and the height of tourist season. The place did begin to fill up by the time we left an hour later. We have had beer here before, which was good, but we were sticking to food and no alcohol tonight. I could have used a good beer to wash away the taste of one of the most foul-tasting salads I have ever had. The avocado salad sounded promising and I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it had a taste that my partner described as \"stale beer.\" Yup. That was it. Something obviously went terribly wrong with the dressing. I left most of my salad untouched but our waiter didn't ask if I liked it or not. Come to think of it, we hardly saw him. I contemplated other meals I could have had for the $11.50 this lettuce monstrosity cost me while my partner ate her wings. Nothing special, she said, but she did appreciate having three different dipping sauces. Coke comes in a can so there are no refills and the iced tea tasted like the dregs of instant. Overall, it was a waste of $30."}
{"text":"This is another great addition to places to hangout in downtown phoenix. The owners are super nice and the space is great. Lots of excellent beer on tap and the food is really good. The even have a few Vegan options and they are very yummy."}
{"text":"If you love craft beer, this should be your go-to or a night out when visiting downtown phoenix. The ever-revolving selection of beers on tap and available beer flights make beer-tasting an adventure. If I had one complaint, it's the difficulty of finding seating for a group every time I've ever visited, even after calling ahead. This is a great problem to have, but it's a solvable problem."}
{"text":"Great menu choices. Awesome feel and vibe w descent service. Would certainly return. Loud interior for a Sunday night. Overall great place."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after hiking for a late lunch and beer. They have a great space! Indoor area is modern and open. Outdoor area is shaded and has misters to keep it cool. There are Adirondack chairs and corn hole available outdoors. Beer selection is large but was under-whelming in our opinion. We were trying to stay with local beers but the sign outside didn't have Brewery names or locations so you would have to ask the server for this information. We had the wings and a burro for food. The wings were AMAZING. Great sauce called moose drool that you must get. Finished up with the homemade pop tarts which were raspberry churro I believe and absolutely worth it. Parking lot was small but we got lucky getting a spot. There is parking around the area if you can't get a spot in the lot. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! Love coming here for a laid back night with friends, to enjoy great food and awesome beer."}
{"text":"First time here the other night, and it will definitely not be the last!    The vibe is cool and I kind of felt that if I were a dude, I would have needed a gnarly beard or fancy mustache.  Tons of beers!!  Huge line of taps with numbers, so you are forced to read the large chalkboard above.  It was a little much for my brain, so I just asked the server to pick a tasty stout or porter for me.    I was pleased to see a decent amount of veg-friendly options (veggie pizza, veggieloaf sandwich, daily special with a veg option, grilled cheese).  I opted for the grilled cheese (I know...I like cheese sometimes, don't hate.) that came with pesto and tomatoes, fries and a side of house-made roasted tomato ketchup.  It was all divine. M'lady had the vegetable pizza, which came topped with lots of seasonal veggies (watermelon radishes, squash, fingerling potatoes, mushrooms, onions, and more).  It was equally as pleasing to the palate.  Our friends ordered the special, fish tacos.  Came with two tacos filled with fish and fried calamari and toppings, rice and beans.  Spicy, but very good and flavorful.  Back to the beers for a moment:  I only ordered the single bevvy, but our friends ordered a flight (any six beers of their choosing) and it came in a cute little muffin pan:)  Kudos all around from the decor to the food!  These folks know what their doing and I like it, I really like it!!"}
{"text":"Great place. Have been here twice now while visiting Phoenix for work. Very good rotating beer list. There is always something good to try. The food menu is great too. Weekly specials and it's often not the norm. Get the spud tacos as an app for sure. If you go on a Tuesday and they have the TV dinner, get it!"}
{"text":"Cool spot with great food and an amazing beer menu. It's become our favorite \"I don't want to cook so let's go out\" spot."}
{"text":"I have yet to have a bad experience and have been there plenty.... I would take any person here even if they dont drink, the menu is unique and delicious... The Tuesday TV dinner is a fun thing to do on a Tuesday night and the price is right ($10).  The beer taps are ever changing so you always can expect a new experience..  There is a lot of pride in ownership, everytime I have been one or both owners have been in the building walking the floor.  The staff can sometimes be aloof but never anything too bad and something that will be worked out over time and experience... A great time!"}
{"text":"Quick beer and plate of fries, cheese curds and gravy. In Canada that's called Poutine, in AZ its called \"the mess\". Loud open atmosphere with a plenty of seating. Not stellar food, but plenty of beer options."}
{"text":"First time I came, some kind of beer fest was going on so place was packed! No space for me so I turned around and went somewhere else. Well I came back and really glad I did. Beer selection is awesome. I ate prior to coming so didn't order any food.  I did my usual which was a flight (6 beers here) and had the waiter select them for me. When I told him I was letting him choose, he told me I made his day.  He chose some really solid beers. And I finished with a 7th beer, a cranberry cider which he claimed was the best cider he's ever had. It was mean good. I think very close to one of the best ciders I've ever had also. Great choice for a great selection of craft beer. Will try some food next time."}
{"text":"Okay the food was good, delicious creations and vegetarian friendly. The only problem I had was when that huge Marmaduke dog showed up and a couple of the Waitresses/Waiters went to rub him. I saw not either of them go and wash their hands. That's the only reason they don't get five stars."}
{"text":"Great handles! Best pop tarts in the world. Lots of fun! The taps rotate often. The patio searing is okay. Overall a great place downtown"}
{"text":"I can see how this place can be popular but they really skip over some details. The pizza was under cooked but the fish tacos were bomb, the beer was amazing but the bathroom was out of soap. Had my Pizza been cooked properly and the bathroom been stocked with soap I easily could've given this place five stars but those are two critical criteria's I judge a place on. So, if you're looking for a bar with pretty good food and yard games...bring your hand sanitizer and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has a good selection of beers on tap. I really like that they change up the brews when one is tapped out. The food is also tasty especially the brewlee burger. They also have wine but I'm more about the suds. One of my to go places to grab a brew and have some good bar foods. Excellent place!"}
{"text":"I'd had my eye on this place for a while and we finally got in to check it out this weekend.  Nice open area with a good sized patio too.  We sat at the bar to watch the Derby since we ran out of time to get anywhere else.  They had it on TV but without sound, oh well not a big deal.  We loved their beer selection and the bartenders were all on top of everything, helpful and efficient.  We had a great time and all the food coming out of the kitchen looked awesome.  We only tried their 'pretzels' which are actually just a few little loaves of pretzel bread, not the same but not terrible.  The stools are not the best and not very comfortable but in the end we enjoyed ourselves and were glad we got the chance to visit."}
{"text":"Always good food, but the beer is why we come here.  The beer and wine selection is great.  Would like a few more local beers and wines from bodega pierce would be a great added selection."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for dinner, and we were shocked to have gotten a table for 6 instantly at 7:30 on a Saturday.   The atmosphere: Chill. The chalkboard with all the different beers they had is cool. The crowd seemed older (at that time) and was just hanging out. Our waiter, however, seemed kind of all over the place. We didn't see him much after our food order was taken; we had to wave him down because we didn't get two items and the table was more than halfway done with the food. He said later on that the kitchen or runner staff was new?? So I'm not sure who's \"fault\" it was. He tried to fix it by comping the app and giving a 50% discount on the entree. I guess at that point, what else could he do?   The food: it was ok. The burger wasn't anything special. My fish tacos were good, and I was thought the portion (2 pieces of fish per taco) was a generous ratio. But I didn't care for the fries, which appeared to be poutine - good thing they were free right, ha! The fries tasted kinda burnt, overdone...and that ruined it for me.   The beer: good things throughout the table.   Overall, maybe a place for beer and not a meal."}
{"text":"Great staff, food and beer. The beer selection is always changing and never disappoints. The food is great. Not the best but really good."}
{"text":"Found this a week ago, been 3 times. Food is great, service is great (kudo to Brittany, Betsy and Braden). So far we've had the \"outlaw\" burger, the ? burger the one with the fried egg on it, the flatbreads, the sausage snack, the pop tarts, the dessert flatbread, and the salad (the one with avocado). I didn't like the fries but my wife loved them. I loved the cole slaw...vinegar and oil dressing not mayo. We went on TV Dinner night (Tuesday)...fried chicken dinner - excellent.  We've asked them to \"customize\" things like the salad and they accommodated us 'no questions asked' happy to make us happy.   The beer selection is excellent ...on the downside, when the keg is empty, they move on to the next one. So we had the Scotch Ale (great!!) in the beginning of the week, but on our return it was gone...we were forced into another discovery ...we tried one of their 6 glass samplers...we picked the 6, and discovered a new \"favorite!\"   The clientele is a mix, old, young, casual, professional. Tables and chairs are basic but comfortable, inside or out on the patio.   Depending on the beverages ordered we've been out the door for $30-$50 for two of us on each of the 3 visits."}
{"text":"My friend suggested this place after the gun show last weekend. The burgers we're awesome me. Very complex yet the beef taste wasn't covered up. The beer was ice cold and the service was outstanding. I'll be taking the rest of the family to this place soon. The pretzel appetizer was very very good. They have some nice looking salads on the menu but when I saw the burger go by I switched it up. The buns are perfect. 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Rob was the best server we've had in a while anywhere. He's usually the bar keep so I guess we were lucky to get him for a table server. But that's ok I'll just follow him to the bar next time. Rob was pleasent, beer informative & then some. We had the wings which are delightful but if you're not a couple or don't like sharing dipping sauces then ask for extra. The wings were crispy perfection & hot (temp). Just great! We also ordered the warm sausage platter & boy freakin' howdy was it a platter. Definitely either getting one or the other next time but not both. Just a lot of food. We could have easily  shared amoung 4 people. However I'm happy to report 3 beers & an hour later we managed to get all of the meaty goodness down. Thanks Angels Trumpet Ale House for the great service, food & of course BEER! We'll be back."}
{"text":"stopped in for dinner last night. It was our 2nd time there since they opened. We previously just had some pints on our first visit but was looking forward to checking out some food. We ordered some flatbread and a burger. The flatbread came to our table 30 minutes later and it was cold. Our server was busy with other tables around us and did not even ask us how the flatbread tasted. We waited another 15-20 minutes and the burger never arrived. The server never did come back to our table to check on us which was pretty weak.  The co-owner noticed our frustration and approached our table. I explained the situation and she was very cool and apologetic although was making excuses about the horrible service.  The server finally came back to our table after seeing the owner talking to us (weak)....anyway, I asked the owner to comp the flatbread and bring the check for the brews we ordered.  I understand they are trying to work out the kinks with the kitchen problems but the server really dropped the ball and did not apologize. I was quite surprised when the bill came back to the table and saw the beer was not comped by the owner (we had 2 pints and a sample tray)... Before the bill arrived I had specifically stated to the owner it was our 2nd visit and how we wanted to come back again. I told her I was impressed with the beer menu and thrilled they had Saison Dupont on tap that evening. Anyway, I paid the bill with a $0.00 tip and we left...worst dining experience I have ever encountered in my life. I am hopeful with time they will be running an efficient kitchen but our server was piss-poor and the fact we had to pay for the beer after the fiasco with the food was unacceptable."}
{"text":"I have been back to Angel's Trumpet quite a few times since my original visit and they continue to improve!! The waitstaff has been very helpful and friendly, and although they (understandly) can't speak with authority about all of their beers, they were always willing to get me one of the owners - who are beer gurus - to answer my questions.  I finally got to try a sour/wild beer on tap!!   The weather is so nice this time of year, and I love it when they have their big garage door open - which also helps the sound level quite a bit.   The homemade poptart is a fantastic, fluffly, baked puffed pastry with delicious filling and cream cheese frosting - think a gormet toaster strudle.  The ketchup is very interesting since it is made in-house and its nice to actually taste that tomato flavor.  I NEED to try their fluffernutter (peanut butter + marshmall fluff) next."}
{"text":"Only gave 4 stars cause long tables are hard to get out of. The food was very good. We had pretzel bites with amazing mustard. I had tacos, very filling.my ding complains had the fish, grilled cheese. Very noisy but a great patio."}
{"text":"Picked this place based on the reviews from yelp while at a conference for work.  If you like scratch made food with eccentric ingredients you will love this place.  Hip clientele and a nice outdoor patio make this a great weekend, dinner, lunch or weekend eatery.  Beer is great.  They only keep small kegs of beer so the selections changes continuously throughout the night.   Beer selection is on a chalk board.  Fun!  I had the matador and it was great.   We shared the sausage plate and wings and it was probably too much for four people.  I would save room for the entree."}
{"text":"Angel's Trumpet is one of my favorite stops to hit in downtown Phoenix. Really nice atmosphere, excellent and friendly service, and a fantastic rotating beer list. Definitely a good spot to grab a bite & a brew. Super bike friendly w/ a great patio area.   Tuesday's are the best, when they have a different weekly \"TV dinner\" special for only $7. You get a variety of delicious items that fit within a certain theme, served on cute \"school lunch\" trays."}
{"text":"Good place to meet up for a drink after work. Good selection of brews, wait time too long."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my first experience. The server recommended the flight to start so we could try 6 different types of beer. The food was delicious! I'm not big on getting salads when I'm out to eat, but we split the Avocado salad with The Tractor flatbread. SO good! I will go back just for that salad!"}
{"text":"I can see why people might complain about the customer service. The hostess (we'll call him stuck up hipster dude) was un-engaging and sort of rude. Fine. No problem... we'll just sit at the bar. The guy at the bar (we'll call him lumberjack) was helpful and allowed us to try a beer before we made a decision. We liked the bar, it was comfortable and friendly.   The beer... I love the selections. There is a constant rotation of what is on tap, and the prices aren't bad at all. I supposed the chalkboard style menu can be a bit confusing, but it could be worse. Beats printing out new menus every day.  I got the rodeo burger with extra bacon. HOMERUN. So awesome... the fries very were good, I liked the ketchup substitute they serve... it fit the meal perfectly. I left with a happy stomach!  We eventually moved to a table once our group showed up. Again, stuck up hipster dude wasn't much help. I picked the table I wanted when he couldn't find any words to use.   Our server was soft spoken and reports from the other side of the table were that he was a bit drunk (based on smell). He did his job well though. We got our orders and drinks refilled. Functional alcoholics don't bother me too much.   My friend loves this place and I can see why, I'll be back for many more visits."}
{"text":"Outstanding daily beer selection with fantastic food, excellent service, and approachable ambiance.  A go to place every time I'm downtown.  With over 25 beers on tap, you are sure to find whatever brew wets your whistle from pedestrian to bold and food that is far above average to accompany it.  The Angel wings are awesome with 3 different sauces, the smokey brisket on/in anything is amazing, or go lighter with the 810 sandwich.  The staff won't lead you wrong whatever pint and/or plate you choose to bury your face into."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and the beer selection is great. It's a little noisy in there but not so bad. There is outdoor seating as well.  I've been here a couple times and the problem with th is the staff.   The waiters and waitresses can be pretty inattentive to those sitting outside, especially if you're just getting drinks and not food.  I also watched a bartender refuse to serve a customer because the customer hadn't tipped him for his last drink.   Basically, a lot of the staff has that can't-be-bothered sort of attitude. If you're okay with that then you should definitely go. If you like to have some respect, you should try elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great, Great, Great. Did I mention Great? What a cool spot, I'm sure to be a regular. It's located right across the street from Filmbar on 2nd st and Just South of Roosevelt. I LOVE the huge selection of beers. I did the sampler, which cost a measly $9 and allowed me to try 6 beers (around 4 oz each). 3 of the beers were great, 3 I hated, but that's the bonus in getting a flight! I also had a sausage sampler with housemade chorizo, some germain sausage and wild boar sausage. All of it was awesome. it was served with housemade ketchup, a fwe mustards, grilled onions and some potatoes. I can't wait to go back and get the same plate. Awesome ambiance, I was suprised how bright and airy the interior was."}
{"text":"This was part 2 of our food adventure and it did not disappoint! The place is very aesthetic. Love how they set up the place. It's a seat yourself type place and they have a ton of beer on tap.   Pros: +nice and relaxing feel, inside and outside seating +there's a beer sampler you can get so taste multiple beers for 10$ +the food is delicious!   Spam slider was a unique twist on using spam. The chicken quesadilla was also amazing! Love the pickled onions on there. It was part of the seasonal menu too so not sure if they serve this all the time.   We wanted to try dessert because we heard it was good but the flavor of tart they had that day did not sound appetizing so we passed.   Cons: - can't think of any"}
{"text":"If you like beer, might be the best place in AZ.  Prices are great and the staff is really down to earth and helpful.  30 beers on tap. Food and atmosphere is up scale but very homey and relaxing"}
{"text":"Every time I've been its been ok. The menu is limited and a couple of times Ive gone they have fun out of dishes. Good for them to to sell enough that they run out, but then you leave your customer trying to figure out plan B. They are always rotating taps when something runs out which is cool. I want to go back for the TV Dinner, we just always seem to miss it or they've sold out."}
{"text":"Had a great happy hour here after work a few weeks back.   Great venue with a ton of seating both indoor and outdoor.   Large beer selection with roughly 40 beers on tap so everyone in the group should be able to find something they like.   Food was solid. Because they had the smoker I went with the brisket sandwich which was well done."}
{"text":"This is a great place!  31 beers on tap and Great food.  The beers are ever changing and they have an awesome selection/variety.  The food is very good.  Fun place to hang out!!!"}
{"text":"Oh. My Word. HOW have I never yet reviewed you, Angels Trumpet!? Of all the many places I've come to adore in the Valley, Angels Trumpet Ale House remains King of the Hill. I can still remember my first time there - the way my eyes crossed when I saw that massive chalkboard loaded full of delicious craft beer options!  Angels Trumpet Ale House officially offers THE BEST selection of quality craft beer in the Valley. It offers THE BEST grilled cheese sandwich, THE BEST burgers, THE BEST fries, and THE BEST ketchup. Did I just say THE BEST ketchup? I did. Angels Trumpet makes their own ketchup and it's good enough to drink on its own! (Seriously.)  Angels Trumpet Ale House is THE FIRST downtown eatery I introduce my friends (and any newcomers) to when given the opportunity. It is THE FIRST restaurant on my mind when I get hungry. I now live all the way up in North Scottsdale and still make a point of traveling the 45+ minutes south and west just to eat here.  The beer list of 30+ craft beers rotates constantly, so you've always got fresh new options to choose from. The beer flights are VERY reasonably priced and serving sizes are always more than adequate (for both food and drink). The homemade pop tarts are freaking delicious, too, and I don't even like sweets or dessert foods.  If you have yet to experience the Angels Trumpet difference, you need to. And don't just go once: visit a few times - get to know the menu. I've never ordered anything here and been dissatisfied. The ambiance is wonderful, the service is outstanding, and the food/drinks are out-of-this-world delicious. Give it a try!! I'm confident you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Visited Angels Trumpet Ale House yesterday. The location is great. It is right downtown, perfect location. The ambiance is very casual with a beautiful patio. The beer selection is amazing. We had the verde tacos and they were amazing. Service was stellar. Sad I haven't been here before. I for sure will be back soon!"}
{"text":"While walking I had a thirst for a cold pint. Out of the corner I find this Alehouse opened, chill and relaxed atmosphere. So relaxed you grab your own menu and have a choice of community table, bar, outside seating, or perhaps a lil couch. Service was friendly, ordered local brew 8 Street pale ale and sweet potato taquitos with leafy pesto! Delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The burger had a charbroiled taste and it came with this marinara sauce. the French fries were seasoned with sea salt. They also have a great selection of beer but I really couldn't  tell you  how it was.  The restaurant had a environmental friendly outdoor look. They also have bottle coke"}
{"text":"I'd never been here until yesterday, when we stopped by as part of the Urban Ale Trail. I was very pleasantly surprised at how the employees handled the craziness. While some of the other locations were packed and short staffed, these people were on their game. They have a great beer selection, and a really great staff. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We traveled from Prescott to the Phoenix airport and stopped in to have a bite before our flight. We ordered the avocado salad with smoked turkey, the cemita sandwich, the big guppy sandwich, along with interesting brews and draft wines. This was the best meal we had on our thanksgiving trip! Reasonable prices, knowledgeable staff, and the culinary highlight of our week. Good job!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the great selection of beer and the burgers.  If you like old school, try the spam sliders!  This placed is unused and slightly weird.  But it is very clean and laid back.   I am a fan and when I come back to Phoenix I will make a stop for sure!"}
{"text":"Love this place when I'm in the mood for a craft beer flight and some great food. I've had the poutine which is delicious, and I most recently had a burger and asked for the poutine gravy on the side for my fries. It was also tater tot night, so my friend and I had those for an appetizer. The tots were good but nothing to rave about, but they came with three dipping sauces, which was nice. There is great seating outside, but I prefer to sit at the bar so I can fully view the beer offerings as they often change one or two taps during a two hour visit! This is a downtown staple for me."}
{"text":"Really fun place!  So many options for adult beverages!  Came here after a dBacks game (we won!) it was busy! Good food too"}
{"text":"This place has an awesome selection of craft beers and you can try a 6 for only $9. The only down side is trying to figure out which ones to try and the at least my server wasn't too eager to help me choose. So so I randomly picked the 6 I thought sounded good, I wasn't disappointed but I don't know a whole lot about beer so it should have been nice to get some suggestions. So the service wasn't too spectacular but the beer was fabulous and the food was pleasant as well. I had the pretzels and wings. Personally I like that the wings come with the sauce on the side because I enjoy crispy wings and it's way cleaner. Oh one more thing since this place is located downtown there are very few parking spaces so be prepared to park a a meter."}
{"text":"Good times would go again great beer selection and wings were really good. Great atmosphere...try new a new beer or two! If you are not a beer drinker they do have some wine choices available."}
{"text":"Always looking for the next great place to grab a beer and while hesitant due to it's awful name and terrible logo (figured this couldn't be a good sign), I decided the beer devotion claims on their website were enough to pull me in.  I'll start out by saying there is nothing worse than a \"beer bar\" carrying all the same domestic brew you'll find at your local dive bar. I can go anywhere to grab a tasteless lager, a slightly hopped pale or predictable red ale. With the recent explosion of craft over the past few years, I figured that so many of these places would pop up and easily be done correctly...WRONG! While many bars attempt to have a \"craft beer garden\" they still play it safe and that's unfortunate. ATAH does not, and that's why I was happy to give it my official seal of approval.  Walking in, I had no idea what to expect. I almost drove past the place and wasn't entirely certain which door to enter through (I think there was only one but I don't rememeber it being marked very well). Upon entering, we weren't greeted by anyone but the bar is where I head anyways. Simple concept inside, clean and hard to miss what's on tap. We ate a BBQ chicken sandwich, it was average...but I wasn't there for food. The beer selection was fantastic, offering a wide variety of brew and probably something to please everyone...and with 30+ taps, if you can't find something you like, that's your own problem. I loved the fact that they offered a handful of beer I had never seen on tap anywhere in Phoenix before, which is something pretty rare around here. This tells me what whoever is running this place isn't afraid to charge that extra buck or two for something a true beer lover will be happy to see on tap.  Also, I must mention one more thing I liked about this place. While AZ brewers and Crescent Crown sit around and try to push this whole \"Drink Local\" campaign in our faces, this place had two local taps. I thought that was just enough for what they could afford to offer based on tap real estate and respect local brewers. There is nothing more frustrating than a bar that thinks it's a good idea to gather tons of AZ beers and serve them all in one location. Here is a tip to any bar owners who think AZ beer is good for service: AZ beer is NOT good for service.  Great place and I will be back."}
{"text":"After going to a great show downtown, we were looking for somewhere to go to have a couple of beers and some food. A friend suggested Angels Trumpet Ale House.   We arrived about 9:30pm on a Saturday night, fully expecting a crowd. We were relieved to see there were many open tables and our party of 7 was sat right away. Great! We're off to a good start! After studying the menu and deciding what we wanted (we were starving and thirsty), we patiently waited for a server to come and greet us. 10 minutes went by. No server. 15 minutes. No server. 20 minutes. No server.  While I would usually be understanding if it was busy (I used to be a server myself, so I have a high patience level), MULTIPLE servers were walking past our table looking like they had absolutely nothing to do. One male server was actually strolling around whistling with not a care in the world. We were absolutely in shock at the lack of acknowledgement we received by anyone other than the hostess. After waiting 25 minutes and still not being approached we all got up and left. On the way out, the hostess said cheerfully, \"Thanks for coming in! Have a great night!\". Sure, we probably would have had a great night if we actually would have been served.   It takes a LOT for me to complain about service. As I said before, I have been a server, and I know how stressful it can be...when it is BUSY. This place was NOT busy and had plenty of servers. We ended up leaving frustrated and hungry.   We will not be giving this place a second chance, nor can I recommend it to others after the experience we had.   Horrible service. Absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"My fiancé was in the mood for beer & a burger so I started my Yelp search. I've had Angel's Trumpet House bookmarked for a while now, so when that came up, we immediately thought to try it out. They have a very small parking lot in the back, it was full when we arrived but we were able to get metered parking right across the street. There was sign at the door saying to grab a menu & seat yourself, so we did. We really wanted a table outside to enjoy the beautiful AZ weather & were able to grab the last one right as we walked outside.  We got a flight of beer to start off with. The only one I really wanted to try out was the Apricot Cider, my fiancé ordered the rest. He got the Breakside Stout, Daily Wages, Dragonhosen, Fruitwood, Brown Shugga. The Breakside Stout was his favorite, followed by Fruitwood, then Brown Shugga.  I had seen some really impressive photos on Yelp of the fish tacos so I decided to get the Big Guppy for my meal & my fiancé got the Outlaw Burger with a tomato & french fries.  My meal was very colorful! The fish looked perfectly fried with a bright secret sauce (as listed on the menu) & corn relish on top, pico de gallo & avocado mash on the side along with refried beans & spicy coleslaw. Everything tasted absolutely delicious! The sauce on top of the fish had a bit of heat to it, the pico added a bit of acidity, & the avocado mash was really creamy and added a cooling effect. The refried beans also had good flavor & a bit of heat, but the spicy slaw didn't have much flavor. That was probably the only disappointment, however I would definitely get this dish again!  My fiancé really enjoyed his burger. He's not a huge fan of BBQ sauce on a burger, but he said this burger tasted good. I only tried a bite, which tasted really peppery, but the tomato he asked to be added made the whole thing. I did snag quite a few of his french fries. They came with a side of tomato sauce which was interesting! It seemed like their substitute for ketchup.  Overall, the atmosphere was good, the beer was good, & the food was really good so 5 stars! They have some specials, & we'll be going back soon to try out their TV dinners on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"If you choose one place to eat for the rest of your life, pick up a fork and STAB YOUR WAY INTO THIS RESTAURANT because damn. Angels is one of my all time favorite restaurants. I would boycott its destruction. I would stand in front of a tank rolling at me for this restaurant, and I would sacrifice my first child to the food gods to LIVE at this restaurant. Do you love burgers? Go here. Do you love beer? Go here. Do you love pizza and homemade poptart desserts?! YOU GUESSED IT, GO HERE! The beers, the plethora of beers, are listed in chalk behind the bar, which showcases simple taps running from one end of the bar to almost the other side. The selection is out of this world, even cider drinkers, like myself, find something. I have -no joke- had dreams about the pretzels and cheese dip. Not only is that my favorite thing in the world, but Angels does it better than anyone. It's a great app to share and its freakin fantastic. Living that cheese life, bruh. I have had tons of stuff on this menu so i cannot discuss them all buuuuuuuuuut any burger is worth it. They do everything, from buns to condiments, just right. When I say these burgers are a hot mess, I mean it in the best way. Like the Kate Upton of burgers kind of way. Sexy and full figured. The Meat Treat pizza is my go-to because, if you read my bio you'd know, I freakin love meat. This crunchy pizza crust has the perfect meat to cheese ratio and is super easy to heat up the next day. When I eat out, you better believe I am bringing home leftovers so I can eat tomorrow. You know what's up. Girl's gotta eat. If you're looking for a fun night out with beers and kick ass cuisine, this gastropub is your stop. The beer bottle lights and the high top tables along the north side of the restaurant are perfect for large groups. I had a party there and we took up three long high top tables inside that connect to three long high top tables outside; they were separated by a wall that completely opened up the upper half of the wall with sliding windows! If food is life, then Angels is where you should be living it.   There may be a wait, but that's because EVERYONE ELSE KNOWS that this restaurant is the bees knees. Suck it up, wait with a drink at the bar, and eat until you realize you should try to set up vacancy there.   Also, their fish taco game is on point. And their fries could stop wars. Just sayin'. It's the simple things."}
{"text":"Went there last night.  Had a great experience...fun patio, great beer and food.  A must go to location in downtown Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Five stars just for the beer selection. Four stars for the food and four stars for the service. Never a disappointment. Location is 5 stars and this place is clean. Overall, I round up and it gets the five star.   I am not a five star tramp stamp."}
{"text":"Great modern spot and an amazing beer selection. The hostess had a major attitude problem and the service was awful, it took 10 minutes for someone to come to our table. I'll try it again but if hte service is the same I won't return."}
{"text":"What a great place! Went here with a bunch of people from work for happy hour. They were crazy busy, but still gave good service.   The grilled cheese I had was amazing. I can't explain the delicious combination of flavors, but it involved honey, bacon, & various cheeses. Go there & get it ASAP. I can't drink beer, but I had a good New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"So Great!!  Some fantastic food!  There is great craft beer and wine, but the food is to die for!  I had a grilled cheese, with tomato and pesto and then they added bacon jam.  That's right....bacon jam!  It is like heaven!!  I finished off my meal with their homemade pop tart!  It was filled with peaches and had goat cheese and mint on top!  I can't tell you how great my entire meal was!  The bartender helped me select beer that went with my meal....just awesome!!!  Run...don't walk there!  I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and had the Brewlee Burger and the featured sammy of the season. It was a lightly breaded chicken breast sandwich with a jalapeno ranch and thick cut bacon on a brioche. It was delicious especially when paired with a Witte brew beer and and a four peaks light hefeweizen beer. We are both planning our next adventure and may do a flight of beers with a their flight of sausages (the appetizer)."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I go to a lot of places.  Some try to be too ambitious and fall on the face with their overly-complicated menus. Some try to take things down to a more simple idea and end up overshooting, making everything bland and too usual.  Angel Trumpet has no such flaws.  They're also not perfect, but I can justify that 5-star review.    Let's get it out of the way:  The chairs suck, they're kind of uncomfortable and rigid.  The beer prices are kind of what we like to call \"astronomical\" for a mostly poor beanly-fellow such as myself.  The food can come out a little slow.  It's all true, if someone else said it in another review, I can back that all up.  And yet, I don't really give a damn.  This is a local joint in downtown Phoenix peddling 31 different beers that are always rotating.  Not a \"regular\" beer in sight.  It's what downtown Phoenix has been clamoring for.  And if you're coming to an ale house, you're coming to drink first and eat later.  Still, I like their food.  Stroganoff burger...oh man.  I'm such a sour cream whore and, I love my food saucy and wet but I hate soggy stuff.  The bun stood up to the stroganoff sauce and the sour cream and the mushrooms and the juicy medium-cooked beef perfectly.  The 810 sandwich with hand-pulled turkey works in spite of the overly-southwestern theme (pull back on the adobo a bit, it can taste like the restaurant equivalent of \"taco seasoning\" that every white person I know uses to make tacos) because each of the ingredients is high-quality.  The bread is fresh and crisped.  The ribbon chips are amazingly thin.  People have griped and complained for literally decades that downtown doesn't have any neat, laid-back places to have a beer and be a human, with most places downtown still ready to serve the post-5pm cattle herd and nothing more.  Here you have a genuine Phoenix experience.  Don't gripe too much.  Soak it up.    We'll will be back there.  Will you?"}
{"text":"So my 1st time here.  I'd love to say the place is ok but all things human related here bring it down.  Allow me to explain.   So you walk in, awesome! Tons of unique beers on tap, outdoor patio area, sand pit area to play cornhole/bags!! I said to my friend \"great call\"...then the disappointment began.  1st off...no beer list.  Oh wait...there is..it's on a chalkboard back in the main area and a completely obscured moving chalk board across the patio.  Ummmm WTF? I have great eye sight but I can't see around the fatty, heat lamp and dude with his ass crack hanging out.  Ok, so I guess this is a \"get up and look at board\" type of service.  Great.  So that's what I did.  No description of beers other than a #, name, type of beer.  Guess this place is for professional beer brewers only.    2nd...service took forever...and it wasn't even that busy.   3rd...food...also took forever for a simple pizza...ahem..they call \"flatbread\".  I guess i differ on that.    4th...beer...well, I can't complain here...I tried a sampler and they were good. Some real strong ones in their rotation of 27+ beers.  So at least they got that right.    Note to management.  Really that hard every day to sit down and write out what beers are available that day and a little description and then photocopy that 100+ times? Really? Chalkboards? Basically your laziness=causes customers more work...and people don't know really what the hell they are ordering. In other words...not all IPA's are the same. So can ya fill some people in?  If you are a big beer fan and brewer by all means, this is your place.  If not, I'd say seek your libations elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wow.  I drink a lot if different beers but this place is incredible.  Of the 30 or so beers on tap, I had tried 6.  Great vibe, nice people and a knowledgeable staff.  Food was great.  One suggestion...try the beer sampler, six three oz pours and you can try everything.  One more thing...alcohol content probably averages higher then normal...be careful.  A great place.  Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Drinks are too expensive. Waitress charged us almost full price for half of a beer when the keg ran out. And a shot of wine was $7."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Great location, plenty of parking available, awesome service.  LOTS of beer options and wine on tap.  The staff is educated on the huge beer selection, and very friendly.  I don't think I've ever waited longer than 10 minutes for my food.  Tuesday night TV dinner is awesome, creative, and the quality is good."}
{"text":"We went on the unofficial opening night and the place was packed! The owner was at the door greeting everyone as they walked through and we randomly got a free beer, which made for a really nice bonus! The atmosphere is really cool and laid back and you cant go wrong with their beer selection. A little pricey, but worth if for the beers on tap. I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I've never been here! Cute concept, kinda like one big room! Tons of beers on tap and a large back area to sit outside and enjoy the phx weather! The green chairs outback kinda gave me a cafeteria feel! Prices are pretty good we ordered the pretzels which came out warm and soft (ask for extra cheese Bc the one it comes with won't be enough).  Also ordered the wings crispy and tasty! For the main dish we got the outlaw burgers cooked perfect nice and moist and the bun wasn't soggy was just missing something? Little lack luster is the taste dept, the fries it comes with are crunchy and perfect giving me five guy fry vibes! The side sauce its served with tasted like spaghetti sauce, I'd pass on that  next time! Overall cute spot will defiantly be back to see what other beers they rotate in on top!"}
{"text":"Great fish tacos. That's all I've had the few times I've been there. I'm a creature of habit so when I find something I like I stick to it."}
{"text":"A world class beer bar in Phoenix with delicious food. This is something special.  I used to find the chalkboard beer menu a bit difficult to deal with, and it's still a hassle occasionally, but the excellence of the beer selection and the tap maintenance, the deliciousness of the food, particularly the burgers... I go every chance I get."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I was in with a friend a few months ago and we had a great bartender and I had a couple of beers but we didn't have any food.  This time I came back with family and and we had food.  This place suffers from the more is better and more bacon is even better mentality that is in vogue with those that don't understand balance.  The meat pizza was good but over topped which made the crust go soft and bacon dominated all of the meats.  My wife had the summer berry salad special.  She liked it but said the dressing was too oily and didn't have enough vinegar.    I had the Garfield which is a turkey wrap with bacon and cranberry aioli.  The only flavor was bacon.  I really missed the cranberry flavor.  A simpler version done at SunUp is much more balanced.  The beer selection was skewed bizarrely to +7% ABV beers.  There were only a couple of \"sessionable\" beers available.  The ESB I tried was flat and tasted more like a brown.    The house ketchup it terrible - it isn't sweetened and tasted like canned tomato paste.  It is bitter and sour and really ruined the decent fries that came with my sandwich.  If the place could lose some illusions and pull back a bit it could be a great spot.  Oh, the place only had a few tables of people and noise level was horrible, maybe that is why the waitress missed my iced tea order, although the staff seemed to have no problem talking to each other for long stretches.  Given the spotty service and the fact that one of our glasses was dirty and my daughters soda had something floating in it, I won't be quick to come back.  My wife commented that the bathrooms and the dining area were very clean."}
{"text":"Pros - Great beer selection, constantly changing, and you can tell the owners have a serious passion for the topic.   Beer Flight from anything on the board is a tasty treat for experienced beer drinkers, or a nice way for less serious drinkers to explore.  The food was good.   The building itself is interesting on the inside, and has a fun vibe overall.  Yay for a new place in downtown Phoenix, especially next to the great FilmBar!  Cons - The servers don't seem to know much about the beer. We had to order by number because our server was so confused. This might get fixed with experience and training, but I would expect an \"alehouse\" to at least nail this out of the gate.  The menu has some glitches yet, which our server warned us about. It took multiple trips to the kitchen to figure out which food they had/didn't have. Kind of took the fun out of trying to pair our beers with our meals.  Main building was so noisy we could barely hear anyone our table. Outside wasn't an option because it was pitch black. So if you go at night, you get to see or hear everyone else in your party, but probably not both.  Parking Lot is a trap. We watched seven cars in a row pull in, realize there was nowhere to go, then back out onto the street to find street parking. Surprised there was no accident.  In spite of being told no smoking on the patio, several people were smoking and none of the servers or managers seemed to care. So is smoking allowed or not? Who knows. Mildly annoying by itself, but I think an example of the bigger problem that not everyone here is on the same page yet. Your visit will likely vary widely depending on when you go and who takes care of you.  I had an okay time, but have no desire to return. Giving them 3 stars because I love their idea and love to see something new downtown, and hope others try them out while they work to raise their game."}
{"text":"I liked this place! The service was great which is most appreciated. The place was quite packed, but since it's open seating/seat yourself it was difficult to find a spot to accommodate a 9 top. Several of the employees helped us gather a table. They have an extensive beer list on the chalk board, so although it was a little tough to read through them all and choose, it was exciting to try some new brews! Food items were simple favorites with a unique twist; fish tacos were delicious and everyone else seemed to like their picks too! Seems like they have some fun special happy hours so I'll definitely be back. Again, service was awesome!"}
{"text":"I didn't get a server to come over for almost 10 minutes, I went in the late afternoon and I had a weird feeling that the food would be blah so I paid for my drink and I ended up going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Always great beer to choose from and the food is great.  I love the flat breads.  So yummy.  Hit or miss on the wings.  The first time we had them, they were AMAZING.  The 2nd and 3rd time? Meh.  Wish those would be consistent.  But overall..super great place to hang out."}
{"text":"Great rotating selection of beers and great food to pair with them. They have excellent flatbread pizza and some of the best burgers in Phoenix.   Staff is great overall and if you can't decide on a beer, ask their bartender, Cory. She's great and can always pick a good one for your taste!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times. I'm a guy that loves beer.   The ONLY reason why I'm NOT giving this place 5 stars...They have a HUGE, actually 2 HUGE chalk boards where they post the 30-40 or so beers they have on tap. Which is awesome. But I like to sort of have a selection of different types and a history on the beers, like where they are from ect... The servers usually know but not every beer. So you either have to ask, know or look up on your phone, plus it's sorta hard to read, just overwhelming.   Other then that, the patio is dog friendly. I've spent a day or to on it drinking with a friend and her dog just relaxing. They even have water bowls for the dogs.   The food selection is a bit limited but they best thin on the menu is the meat pizza, the shit is probably one of the best pizza's i've ever had.  Oh and you can fill up your personal growlers here too."}
{"text":"I couldn't be happier, I asked Jake to surprise me with a flight and described what I liked and he brought an amazing selection. Love the ambience of the low lighting and music you can conversate over."}
{"text":"What a great place. It has great staff and good vibe. located in a part of town you wouldn't expect and brings you next to Film Bar, another fun place. I've been many times now and have ordered the wings ( A+) burgers and flat breads. The desert I could only comment on it not being the greatest, but fortunately we fill up before getting to desert so we never order it. The beers are all good and the staff is excellent at guiding you to the right choice. The patio is dog friendly and fills up quickly. I love this place and find myself going back as a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Few places in Phoenix can be rated top 10 places to eat. Logically. And Angel's Trumpet happens to be one of those places. And this place deserves to be in that bracket for sure. Their food is fresh, and their beer selection is incredible. The beer flight is a classic, tried and true method for trying new beers without having to chug entire glasses down.  I came here with a friend and discovered some really interesting favorites that I hope will be on the menu. A beer I tried had a very herbal, sage taste to it in its finish and it paired very nicely with the burger and fries that I got.  One thing to note, while I did give this place a full five stars, I personally don't recommend the brulee burger when drinking.   \"But Russell, why did you give this place five stars if the brulee burger isn't five star worthy?\"  ONLY when drinking. See, drinking can cause hypoglycemia. But then you ask, well, eating a brulee burger, which has sugar, seems like a good idea right? Here's the thing, it's straight up sugar. Which, for me personally, makes me feel sick. Eating potatoes or any form of slower intake of carb calories mitigates the stomachache issue. But maybe that's just me."}
{"text":"1st visit. post golf lunch on a Wednesday afternoon:  Lots of available parking.  Cool ambiance/atmosphere. Half indoor, half outdoor. Whatever works for you.  32 beers on tap plus wine. Good selection of varied brews.  Low key wait staff. No rush, no pressure.  Pints, tulips, and snifters, depending on the beer. Something for everyone.  Hummus, pita, & veg, to start. Awesome.  Paisano (?) Pizza - today's special, was fabulous. Great crust that held up, didn't get soggy. Tasty sausage.  $52 (before tip) for 5 brews, appetizer, pizza. Completely satisfied."}
{"text":"What a great place for a large selection of micro beers on tap. Staff friendly and helpful and my avocado salad was delicious. There is a nice seating area outside too. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend to have a few drinks and service and drinks were great. I didn't order any food, so can't say much about that. The bartenders were very helpful in choosing what you fits your palapte."}
{"text":"We loved it here.  It's VERY busy on First Friday - just an FYI.  It was a minimum 30 minute wait at prime dining time and very hot inside the restaurant.  Outside of that, the staff was friendly though a bit \"flaky\".  I assume it's b/c they were very busy.  The tap options were endless and as others have mentioned, rotate as they go throughout the evening.  It's a great way to keep you coming back for more!  They have a beautiful patio with a lot more dining tables and that is where we got to sit.  I love eating outside in perfect AZ weather!  We got the veggie flatbread which was DEEEEELISH and can I just say ...Oh. Em. Gee with regard to the wings.  They were roasted to perfection and served with three sauces on the side, which was ingenious! I really enjoyed that touch so I could mix and match the sauce.  I am still drooling over the amazingness that was the wings!  Get them.  The beer options were also wonderful and the price point is average.  I would have spent more money here but I was jet-lagged and had to get back to the hotel before I passed out at my table after my two beers.  Light weight here."}
{"text":"Large craft beer selection and great events.  The food is great and the atmosphere is contemperary trendy."}
{"text":"Love this place, food is delish and the beer is always different  and we love that! I always get the flat bred and my husband loves their burgers. The atmosphere of this place is really chill and laid back, we will always go back to Angels Trumpet!"}
{"text":"Service sucks!! Was a \"slow\" night so we were told to pick a table. Sat down for literally 8 minutes before being approached by a waitress to tell us that she would bring menus. She then disappeared and a couple sat down right beside us and received two glasses of water, silverware, and menus before we were even visited by staff again.   The food was just ok. Which was a disappointment because the menu is very ambitious and if excecuted properly, would have had a high ceiling. I would say the wings were very good by themselves but not a huge fan of the 3 dipping sauce options. The bruless beef burger w/ egg was good but you can't really go wrong w/ a burger when cooked right. I want to give this place another try, however my poor customer service experience is really preventing me from doing so.  I was also interested in trying out some of the large selection of beers, however nobody offered or even attempted to gauge my interests of trying anything from the varieties offered. I guess I just made up my own mind, will not be going back to this place. Bummer, was really hoping for good things."}
{"text":"This spot has a cool vibe but what was not cool was the fact that the sprinklers on the outdoor patio were not on continuously.  It was over ninety degrees out and the sprinklers were only on every 15 minutes.  When I asked that they adjust it, they never complied.  You can't offer outdoor seating if you're not going to offer some concessions for the heat.  We live in the desert!   As for the food it was ehh.. I ordered the BBQ burger.  Too many onion straws and the BBQ sauce just wasn't good.  It added no flavor value.. The highlights were the bun and the side salad."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in tonight for dinner after and were pleasantly surprised with everything! We split the spam sliders and each got beer flights and flatbread pizzas. Yoooo   Beer Flights: stouts are still not for me but everything else was delicious and the cupcake tins were cute.  Spam Sliders: all my friends are super hype about spam and I've only ever had it in masubis so these were yummy! very flavorful and the buns were perfect.  Flatbread Pizzas: I love that you have an option to add fried eggs on top. Eggs make everything better. The fun-guy was one of the best pizzas I've had in a while.   Great service and atmosphere too! Would definitely come back to sample more beers and try the pop tarts."}
{"text":"I am giving this review 2 stars for the fact that out of the innumerable amount of times I have gone to Angels Trumpet, this visit was among the worst. The good: our Fun-guy pizza and wings were pretty tasty. The bad: our order took an extra long time to come out; we had to request the additional sides we initially placed and then request another blue cheese because the one our server brought was hotter than our food initially was when brought out (why?!); the two adjacent tables (who came after us) received their food and checks and left before us; and then the server asked us to pay for another tables' check that was the same amount because he screwed up. We paid it without asking for our check to be corrected because we wanted the heck out of there and it was getting busy. I certainly hope this was a unique-one-time-bad experience that won't be repeated. I will request a different section if that server has my table again."}
{"text":"Chose to stop in here last week when I arrived into Phoenix kinda late for work and they were near where I was staying and open late and boy am I glad I did. Great food, great service and even better selection of craft beers on draft. Cool laid back feel and could def see how it'd be a fun spot to hang with the large open outdoor patio area. 6 wines on tap and 30 some rotating beers ranging from local selections to others from around the country and loved that they offered samplers as well. I ordered one of their sandwiches in wrap form (which I found out was possible from a guy that worked there) and was very impressed in how it turned out. Would def come back here if I were in the area again."}
{"text":"Great beer but very crowded; though we did go on first Friday. I would definitely go back but would make sure to get there early to ensure we get a table."}
{"text":"A fun, chill place with a rotating list of beers on tap. Many of the beers they feature are adventurous and unique, and you're not likely to find them on tap at other local bars. Get a sampler flight so you can try a bunch of them!   They have a few wines on tap too, and their food is great!"}
{"text":"Angel's Trumpet is one of my favorite places to eat and drink in Phoenix. I like to try new beers and have never left this place without trying 4 or 5 new ones (via the flights, not full pints - otherwise this would be a review of how nice the toilets are to barf into).  Their burgers are heavenly, their desserts are rad and I can't express enough my longing for their chipotle ranch. I would fill a Camelback full of that stuff and hike Camelback mountain with it, if it wasn't so frowned upon by my doctor.  If you've never been, check this place out. Good food, beer and service. If you really like beer and chipotle ranch, stay very far away because you may never escape."}
{"text":"31 one brews on tap not including the wine! We had the wings, burger, and tacos. The burger was put together perfectly with a carefully cooked piece of beef and egg. Nothing but a mouthful of flavor in every bite. One of the better burgers I've had here in the valley. The fries could use a little love. The naked wings- on point! Three different sauces to dip in, fried in a good batter/seasoning. Moving onto the tacos.... No shortage of flavorful fish, dipped in a good batter and fried perfectly. The beans are to die for, my only complaint was the shortage of beans... Next time I go, I will order an extra side of beans. This place is a must try with a hipster feel to it. You almost feel like you're somewhere else. They provide water bowls for your animals on the back patio. Great job!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, ample beer selection, friendly staff and awesome music (80's alternative - OH YES!). I highly recommend sitting out on the patio for a pint if you're downtown. We had burgers, sandwiches, and wings with both the spicy/tangy and the sweeter sauces.  4-stars because I would like to see more local taps."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and casual yet hip ambiance . Burgers cooked  medium to order and you can substitute with a chicken or smoked pork patty. Only one salad dressing on an all spinach salad. I would pass on the dressing myself as t was a bit blah. Great service and good prices."}
{"text":"So this place had beer, and it's cool looking, so that's something. Unfortunately it has the same interior sound comfort level as a wood chipping factory. That is to say it's so freaking loud you will not, and cannot have a conversation. Clearly the owners are aware, as there are a handful of acoustic tiles on the ceiling, but they need considerably more.   Service was so so, our server kinda tried but she had way too many tables to be effective. I ordered the pretzel app and I have never seen greasy pretzels until now. Their pretzels are more like mini-baguettes and they are super oily. The app came with a mustard and some kind of warm cheese sauce, allegedly. It was so weird, there was 0.0 flavor in the cheese sauce. None. Nada. Zip. The only thing it had going for it was that it was warm.  Our app came with no napkins or flatware and it took 20 minutes to find someone to bring napkins.   Overall this place is better than a kick in the nuts- but it's not a comfortable place to chill with a cold beer.  It only makes me miss The Roosevelt even more than ever, and for that I tip my 40."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and I love the beer. Also our server, I think his was Sean, was excellent and very attentive but without being annoying. If Angel's Trumpet had vegan options, that's the only thing that would make this place better!"}
{"text":"Cool place.  Lots of beer on tap.  You can get you beer custom canned to take home.  Really sweet machine that does it.  They have nitro on tap huge plus for me. Indoor outdoor place which is great in the warm Phoenix evening.  Food looked great too but didn't eat.  I want to go back for food."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great atmosphere, food and Brittany  was great! I had the outlaw burger it was very good. Portion was huge. My husband had tacos and my friend had the bbq brisket grilled cheese. They both enjoy their meals as well. We all had local beer and they were all great!"}
{"text":"I love this place for their many rotating taps, because they almost always have at least one Sour on the menu, and the service is usually very good.  However, their food leaves a little to be desired."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to their opening and now I feel I need to wait a few months longer before I try again.    On a Friday night, a hostess/server greeted us after a good 5 minutes of waiting by the door and asked us if we would be ordering food since the kitchen was backed up.  If we were to order, our food would arrive well over an hour of our arrival.  Naturally, this was all the information we needed enough to say \"No, we're just here for a beer or two.\"  Soon after, we were seated and placed an order for 3 pints.  We waited a good 15-20 minutes for our beers.  During that time, we noticed lots of servers standing around one POS (point of sale).  It looked as if servers were waiting in line to put in their individual orders.  Our suspicion was confirmed later that evening, only one working POS.  I wonder why they didn't have a backup plan-paper tickets?  I would think people would be more inclined to walk out on their tab because of the excruciating wait than management have to worry about losing money with paper tickets.  Our waters were refilled twice before our first round of beers arrived at our table.  Two of my buddies call this place the \"Water House\" because that's all they got when they visited Angel's Trumpet Ale House.    Once we received our beers, we asked her to place another order for another round of beers because we figured that we would receive our 2nd set of beers just as we finished our first ones.  It worked!  If ya plan on having another beer, be sure to place an order as soon as the first beers arrive so that you don't hafta wait long for your second beer.    I think the night was best portrayed by a sneak peek that I got of the owner- he was rubbing his temples and obviously under stress.   I am inclined to give them a star or two more once the timing has improved.    Great building, good ambiance, wonderful patio (hope it's pet friendly), excellent location and a good selection of beers.    Oh, I like the idea of three bathroom choices instead of the typical two."}
{"text":"What can I say great food and loads of choices for beer and wine.  The menu is somewhat limited but the quality is there.  Really like this place."}
{"text":"Gonna be short about this place....GO! If you like tons of crafts, great bar food and a chill vibe."}
{"text":"Headed here on a 'red basket Thursday' with some friends...WOW! This little gem is tucked away and when you find it, you won't regret it! The variety of beers is amazing, truly something for every palate. We got two flights and tasted a dozen different fantastic ales, stouts, blondes, IPAs, you name it. This day's red basket special was a brisket chili dog - delicious! Then we found The Mess (poutine) on the menu... *drool* They do it right, with delicious seasoned fries, real cheese curds, and thick turkey gravy. Everything we tried was stupendous, I recommend this spot for all!"}
{"text":"So glad I finally got to stop into this place before a concert! Wow I am impressed.  Great beer selection. Loved the ambiance. Their food was excellent,  had the taquitos  as an app and tacos as dinner. Yum! Definitely recommend. Located near  Cobra Arcade which is another cool spot to check out afterwards. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I came here last night to try for the first time with my friends and I loved it! We all got beer flights for $9! There's a board of about 30 different beers to choose from. I would definitely recommend the 805 and the Raspberry Cider. The flight comes with 6 3oz. cups in a muffin tin. It was cute.   This place has an inside and outside seating area. Our waiter was super friendly and helpful. I would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Coming from San Diego a huge place with tons of craft beer and places on every corner this place definitely reminds us of San Diego and would come back to enjoy the cheap flights six beers for $10 you can't beat that. They have a so, so variety of beers. Def would come back. Food was good. Vegan options, so that's a plus"}
{"text":"Cool place. Best selection of beers on tap! Beautiful clientele. I just wish the skinny dude brooding behind the bar would smile. I don't like to be grimaced at when I am trying to chill with my $7 beer!"}
{"text":"This is a super unique and fun bar in downtown Phoenix with a great selection of local craft brews. I stumbled upon this place a few weeks ago after a Suns game and was pleasantly surprised with the great atmosphere and trendy vibe. They have a great mixture of new and old. Recently went back to have an early dinner on the patio and had another great experience. I highly recommend the sausage platter as an appetizer and definitely do a flight of beer to sample their selection."}
{"text":"Flight of beers to sample the ever changing menu of craft beers is what I recommend. About 31 choices on draft of local breweries! Server was very knowledgeable and recommended great choices also. Burgers were great and so were the seasonal home made pop tarts! Food and drinks were reasonably priced."}
{"text":"YUM!  The chalkboard of brews and wines on tap rocks! This is a definite must visit if you're around the convention center at all. It's an easy walk from most hotels and will keep you out of the crowds.  I got the gaucho tacos and a glass of red blended wine. Be forewarned, the wine will be chilled (which isn't all that unusual). The tacos arrived with spicy coleslaw and beans. I mixed some of the guacamole in with each taco which also featured mango chutney. It was delicious! I couldn't eat fast enough! This place is a solid restaurant choice with a fabulous ambiance. Don't be scared off by the location, it's worth visiting."}
{"text":"Angel's Trumpet is a nice addition to the downtown Phoenix food and drink scene! I love the dog-friendly patio and the rotating list of beers. I always feel inspired to try new beers here because I can do flights of SIX delicious beers!   Most of the food is great(spud tacos--delicious!) and service has been good each time I went. My only complaint is that it gets REALLY loud in there when it's busy. Loud to the point where you might be yelling for your companion across the table to hear you. Apart from that, it's a great place to hang out with some friends."}
{"text":"Really tasty burger. Had their BBQ but had to add basics like tomato/lettuce and avocado. Solid meat and cook temp and enjoyed their home made sauces. Do wish they had standard mustard. Their fries were good not great. They were a little mushy. Beer selection was slightly limited but I am particular to a hoppy IPA. The one I had was decent but was not fond of their 3 taste per table. I get trying to limit over tasting but I did not even get to try one and that bothered me customer service wise. Service was overall standard."}
{"text":"Was very underwhelmed by the food. Gravy was very different on the poutine, a gelatin consistency and I felt as if the slaw did not pair well with spam on the sliders."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday celebration.  I didn't eat but my companions seemed generally satisfied with their food.  I had a cider that was delicious.    The service went from good to bad.  At one table, we were served promptly and the waitress gave us separate checks.  We changed to another quieter table and were told by our new waiter that he could not split up the checks.  That caused a huge headache amongst our group and we left with a rather negative impression."}
{"text":"They don't have an coke products and very few non alcoholic drinks. That is not very good for DD drivers who are trying to be safe. Also the service was super slow tonight.  I wanted to try the nutter and add the marshmallow fluff but of course they couldn't get that right either. I thought the place was a bar but its a family place with obnoxious kids running around in outside area. I wasn't impressed as much as the last time I was there."}
{"text":"I love the huge variety of beers they have. The environment is very laid back and relaxing. This is a perfect place for catching up or hanging out with with friends. This is only my second time coming here but I've loved both occasions and with definitely be back"}
{"text":"It was quite crowded on the night of first Friday event. Service was a bit tough at the bar -- not that responsive to our orders. But once we got out table, we were taken care of pretty quickly.  For those ale drinkers seeking some new options - do try out this flight combination: 6(kunig Ludwig), 18, 19(corne du devel), 23(krombacher), 30(saison), and 31. Quite tasty!  Also tried the farm pizza from the menu - have to say the pizza was tasty and the cheese on it tasted expensive ;) though it seemed as though they poured a whole salad packet onto the pizza to give it a \"farm\" feel, overall the pizza was delicious an with the flight -- perfect combo!  Good place to hang out and chill in downtown phoenix!"}
{"text":"Like all new restaurants, this place could stand to have a little more insulation to keep the volume levels below deafening on busier nights. I've come to avoid Angels Trumpet on the weekends just because I know how unbearably loud it's going to be inside. Thankfully, the patio is enormous, well shaded, and nicely laid out. So if there's availability you can find solace outside.  The beer selection is, of course, unbeatable. There's something new every day, so you better not fall head over heels for a certain brew because it won't be there for long. The service has always been impeccable and I've come to really trust each server's recommendations."}
{"text":"This place has a really great beer selection and the service was great. The food here was really good and had great portions. They give you samples of a beer before getting it, which is really cool. This place looks terrible on the outside, but the inside is really nice.  I did have one problem...the parking. It's terrible, I hate having to park on the street."}
{"text":"such a great place! cool atmosphere, GREAT food and GREAT service! I'm not a huge beer drinker.....so I was super happy that in addition to their plentiful craft beer list, they also had craft wine! My husband and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"TV Dinner Tuseday is SO FUN! When we went, we had buffalo chicken nuggets, bleu mac'n cheese and a bunch of other awesomeness! Dessert is decadent. Prices are fair. Atmosphere is fun and family friendly! LOVE this place."}
{"text":"What a great stop....loved the spud tacos! Had a delicious guppy with all the sides!!! And a tractor pizza!! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Within walking distance of downtown Phoenix , this restaurant / beer palace is amazing.   A very eclectic selection of local beers as well as a few of my Belgian favorites. (Chimay... I got the last glass before the tap ran dry!!)  The food is phenomenal. The pizzas are a must!  I will be returning in a few weeks for another visit.   Customer for life!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for a beer in downtown Phoenix. Some nearby places like cobra and film bar too. We had the tacos and they were great, would recommend."}
{"text":"Definitely enjoyed visiting Angels Trumpet Ale House during a recent visit to Phoenix! Their outdoor area was quite nice and had a large canopy covering all of the picnic tables. We lucked out that it wasn't SUPER hot out, so we were happy to soak up the warm weather. Their beer selection was huge so we decided to try a few by getting a flight. We didn't end up having dinner here, but their food selection seemed to be pretty good as well. I'm honestly struggling to remember the names of the beers we had, but I am confident that you should check this place out if you're in the mood for a Phoenix brewery hopping day."}
{"text":"What a strange experience... Busy Friday night, out with a friend.   Waiter was... busy? Also inattentive until I made mention of not liking my food. His initial response to me saying I did not like my obviously un-eaten meal was, \"Ok. Well... they may not take it off the bill... The chef makes that decision...\"  Um. Ok... waited.. Then he came back to say, \"They want to know what was wrong with the meal.\" To which I gave him feedback (I had the Matador: both the meat & fries tasted unseasoned).  ... waited... Back again with, \"They said we have to charge you for half.\" At that point, I ended up asking for a manager.  ... waited... The waiter returned to inform me that, \"Because it's such a busy Friday night, the manager is trying to deal with stuff & they can't come over. But they went ahead and took the whole meal off your bill.\"  ... Ok. By then my friend had enough and went to speak to the manager himself.  My friend came back and said the manager had been very kind and understanding, agreeing that he had tasted some of the food and noticed it was a little off. He apologized for not coming over to the table, and agreed it should have been handled well. He also said he had told the waiter to let us know he was going to talk to the chefs about the quality of the food.  ... so... All the nonsense leading up to the conversation with the manager was so unnecessary. I don't know why/how/where the communication broke down, but a customer should not have to \"testify\" in detail to why they did not like their food. It was uneaten. I wasn't lying.  Unfortunately, as close to my home as this place is and as great as it had seemed going into it, I will not be returning.   It's one thing to have mediocre food OR mediocre service...  but you can't have both."}
{"text":"Food and beer here are amazing.  I live downtown and try my hardest not to go here all the time since I want to try other spots. The service is pretty good even when busy and they have a TV so I can watch some games."}
{"text":"Met up with my friend and her mom for some day time drinking. Was not disappointed with this place. Great beer selection and the poutine dish was perfect. Will absolutely be returning"}
{"text":"I can start by saying, their food was GREAT. I had a pizza with an egg which sounds crazy until you have one. I cant complain about the food one bit!   My boyfriend loves beer, so this place to him is a no brainer! Their beer list changes literally daily [they changed 3 different ones while we were there] so you gotta check the menu when you're there.   However, I'm not a huge beer drinker, but I do enjoy some cider and a glass of white wine on occasion. My only wish for this place was they had a few more ciders. Guess I'll have to go back to their revolving beer list to try again!  Also, I thought this place was super hipster urban and fun. They have a great patio as well. If you're downtown, CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at ATAH is definitely cozy with a hipster vibe. There are a lot of beers for you to try and I made the mistake of ordering a pinot noir, which was served too cold. I would suggest sticking to the beer if your'e a wine snob; it is, after all, an ale house.  The empanada I tried was pretty tasty. Wings are nicely portioned but I'm not sure if the accompanying sauces matched very well. I also had a few bites of the sausage platter, which was hit or miss. Service was very slow. I gauge slow service by jokingly contemplating a \"dine-and-dash.\" I would never actually do it, but when I keep thinking about it, a server somewhere doesn't want to take our money. So overall, ATAH didn't leave a great impression but I'm willing to give it another chance."}
{"text":"This place is in my top 5 restaurants ever, seriously it's that good. Their Tuesday night TV dinner special is always off the charts good. I've had more then I can count and they never disappoint.  I wish I could say I was exaggerating when I say I've had everything on their menu over the years...and there's not a single thing I didn't like. This time around we had the meat treat pizza and one of the newer items on the menu a fried chicken sandwich, the name of which I can't remember for the life of me but it had a jalapeño ranch on it that was ridiculously good. Whatever you do don't forget to order a homemade pop tart! The flavors are seasonal and it currently blueberry with a balsamic rosemary reduction on top. I wanted to lick the plate.  Oh man I almost forgot about the beer. A rotating selection of 30 craft beers, yes please! Get a beer flight for 9$ to try 6 at time. It's one of my favorite parts about going.  If you're still reading this and not on your way to Angel's Trumpet for dinner tonight Idk what you're doing with your life!"}
{"text":"Spot had me excited at first. Has seemed to have gone downhill some. First time in reminded me of some breweries in Oregon, but to be fair there's nothing like the breweries in Oregon. Clean newer outdoor indoor seating. Solid rotating selection of 30 or so beers. Some food is unique and clever. Crowd can be a bit dooshy on most nights. Days can be better, like on a Sunday afternoon. It's not just the ASU influence. Service is weak. Kind of a hipster aloof arrogance to too much of the staff. Yes when crowded the ambience is uncomfortable. The noise is like a crowded dive bar but the environment doesn't match. Parking can be difficult but it is downtown area. For the pricing, the experience should be much better. Owners probably making enough to not notice the management flaws now, but eventually these growing problems will catch up."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and drinks last night. Another reminder of why I need to spend more time in downtown phoenix! Amazing place. The server was super friendly and very knowledgeable of the beers on tap, gave us great recommendations and I got to try a handful of them.   The food was great as well. Their burgers are well known and I had fried riblets which were delicious!  Overall, great experience and great prices. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a better review on this, but I only stopped in for a half hour or so. We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon,  pulled up and the private lot was full so parked on the street right outside. It looked like an absolute dive until I walked in and boom, the place really opens up and is really nice! Great casual, noisy environment and was pretty busy, but quick, friendly service with tons of different brews. A little pricey, but that's to be expected at a place like this. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What a great place!  Awesome beer selection, food and atmosphere. Downtown Phoenix has a much needed gem of a draft house. I will be back as much as i can."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and drinks on a recommendation from family.  Did some reading up before going in and were excited by the selection of craft beer.  Pictures of the food left us eager to try a few items too.  We got there early to beat the crowds and were promptly seated.  After a few questions and some pondering we both ordered our beers.  They came out quickly.  I enjoyed the selections, something for every type of beer connoisseur.  Service was very good and we were never left sitting.  Our waitress was very personable.  We both got entrées, a brisket sandwich which was OK (not a lot of flavor), and a burger.  I was disappointed because the burger looked to be a frozen hockey puck type.  Definitely formed by something besides hands.  I was expecting a more handmade type thing at a place with this much gusto.  Still tasted good though.  Fries were also very tasty.  We also splurged on the homemade pop-tarts.  They were awesome!  Highly recommended!  Overall, we will return for sure, just maybe not right away."}
{"text":"The only knock I have on this place is that they're closed on Mondays. Great food. Great beer. Awesome happy hour (2-6). They have 30 something beers on tap. The burgers are awesome. The pizza is awesome. Relatively inexpensive."}
{"text":"Exceptional craft beer selection. 31 rotating taps. Nice ambiance, good service from knowledgable staff, and good food options."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection. Best fish tacos I have ever had. Very cool vibe inside.  The service was top notch also. Three of my friends and I got a table for 4, and 2 others showed up later and got a separate table on the opposite side of the restaurant. We asked the waitress for a larger table to seat all of us. They stopped at nothing to make us happy. Even on a busy Friday night, they were able to cater to us and eventually got the 6 of us together well before we began eating. The waitress earned her high tip. We'll be back again, no doubt."}
{"text":"WOW do we love this place!  Craft Beer (so many different craft beers) and wine on tap.  The wings are unique and fantastic.  Great for a big or small group.  Nice outdoor area with bags to keep you busy.  The service has been consistently good.  We have never gotten a spot in the lot but there is plenty of on street (pay with app) parking."}
{"text":"Last night we went to Angel's Trumpet with our friends Andrew S. and Erin M.  It is a cool new local restaurant and bar in downtown Phoenix that opened a couple of months ago.  They have a huge variety of draft beers and a great selection of food that you can choose from.    We were going over the menus and Andrew S. was telling us about the Spam Sliders.  That is right I just said \"Spam Sliders\".  They were pretty amazing. The Spam was fried the perfect amount and it had feta and coleslaw on it.  I will definitely be back for those sliders."}
{"text":"I love gastropubs. I'm a sucker for  fancy bar food. And Angels Trumpet serves just that.  Usually, when I visit states and cities, that's the search word I use on Yelp \"gastropub\"  I chanced upon Angels and further review of their patron photos and menu, I realized they had poutine -- and it looked legitimate too! Fries, gravy and most importantly, cheese curds.   We were staying in downtown and had no inkling Angels was for the most part, on campus, a hangout for college students, nearly 2 miles away.  We already felt old-ish complaining about the seemingly endless walk, well, after stepping inside, in the company of all the hipster kids,  we felt even more ancient haha.   The menu was interesting, though wasn't unusual for gastropub fare. We ordered a variety of things: chicken wings, poutine, a burger which had onion strings (forgot the name) and the churchill grilled cheese.  I won't go into detail into each entree because they were all just OK. The item I enjoyed the least, surprisingly, was the churchill.  And of course, as expected for many hipster spots, NO regular ketchup. Well don't worry that didn't affect my review.    I really, I mean really enjoyed the poutine.  It reminded me of my days on Montreal when I ate it literally, thrice a day.   If I ever returned to Arizona, I would come back for the poutine.  Much more accessible than Montreal."}
{"text":"Had bookmarked this place ever since it aired on Check, Please! Finally visited two weeks ago and was unimpressed. Service was lacking with poor attention and no enthusiasm by the waitress. Over priced bar food. Ordered the wings and flat bread pizza. Wings were ok but then again I could have found wings anywhere. Pizza was large and enough to take home leftovers. Really nothing special to say. Bookmark removed."}
{"text":"So, so good. BBQ chicken salad is amazing. Casper pizza with salami, feta cheese, leeks, and honey drizzle is seriously amazing. Beer cheese pretzels are amazing. Beer selection is very impressive. Love this place! Wish it were close to my SD home!"}
{"text":"Our favorite tap house in AZ!  Angel's Trumpet has a fabulous selection of beers...I have been exposed to so many delicious drinks here.  Love that you can select the beers you want in your flight!  Also, the food is amazing!  As a vegetarian, I am usually stuck with ordering a vegetarian burger at other places, but they have a TON of choices here.  I love the grilled cheese....with pesto and honey.  YUM!  Stop by and check it out!"}
{"text":"Began the evening with a flight of ipa's.   The selection was outstanding and the bartender patiently answered questions about each brew.   They break the norm of craft brew houses I've been to by not saying \"everything is totally like amazing\" 10-20 times.  They asked what we liked and matched our food preferences with good beer choices."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my visit. Thank you betsie Boop for the amazing service. Had the brewlee burger and was super impressed. Cooked medium rare and they nailed it. Fries were ok, chipotle ranch sauce was a highlight for me. Plenty of beers to choose from. Nice atmosphere. Great place to enjoy some food and beers with friends."}
{"text":"I loved the beer selection!  My feedback is that the inside seating is quite noisy.  We were fortunate enough to be there on a beautiful evening so we could take advantage of the patio.  I plan to do that again.  I don't think my evening would have been nearly as enjoyable sitting indoors, as there seems to be nothing to absorb the sound.  Waitress was a little slow getting around, and we had to wait a bit for our tab.   I will be returning for a social event this week, hopefully I'll be able to have a 4 or 5 star experience, in which case I'll upgrade my rating."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Angels Trumpet Ale House.   Great assortment of delicious beer. The food is really good as well. I recommend the fish tacos... they were surprisingly good. The only reason I am not 5 stars on these guys is some sub par service from a server and a bartender.   The 'Beer to go' option is epic. You can pick your favorite beer from their tap and take it to go in a sealed house beer can. Pretty cool  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've heard only good things about this place, and I was meeting a friend for dinner on a Saturday night, so I decided to give it a try. The dining area is very spacious and they have a huge patio. We were seated promptly and then asked what we wanted to drink, their beer menu consists of 30+ beers all listed on a chalk board above the bar. I wanted to try a bunch so I decided on the beer flight, our server was very helpful and informative in the decision process. I told him what kind of beers I liked and didn't like and he wrote down his suggestions for my flight. All of the beers were very tasty and I decided on a few faves. For our meal, I chose the casper pizza and my friend got the fluffernutter, both were very good and the portion size was large.  I will definitely return to try more beer and food, as it's good spot for getting together with friends!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while we were walking around downtown Phoenix. It was worth the walk, but I would suggest driving. They have a small lot. We started with the spam sliders! The cranberry slaw threw me off a little but it was surprisingly tasty with it. I added sriracha for a little kick. Delicious! I got the avocado salad for lunch. It was  light in flavor but still filling. I love the combination of the yellow beets, mint, avocado, and grapefruit.  My sister got the big guppy. The guac was creamy with a hint a citrus! Her boyfriend for the original salad with brisket. The brisket was smokey. They had a few beers; all of which they liked. I had the abita rootbeer, made with real cane sugar. Very refreshing and strong in flavor. The price was reasonable and food incredible."}
{"text":"Really great Burgers and Flat Breads! Their beer selection is always changing and fun. Very casual and \"hipster\" environment. The staff is usually pretty friendly.  Parking is difficult.  If you are downtown and never been here, you definitely need to check it out!"}
{"text":"pleasantly thrilled with this place. Food was delicious and beer great. service was quick and attentive.  I had the tractor flatbread pizza which was an unusual combo of bacon,  brussel sprouts, and sunny side up eggs,  but it all worked together perfectly! hubby had the Matador with beef brisket, onions, peppers, cheese and horse radish dip with a side of Cole slaw and that was yummy too! I would definitely go back, especially for happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!! So many new and fun types of beers to try. The food is so good! The fish tacos are to die for!"}
{"text":"This is a long overdue review from several months ago.  I went with a group of friends for brunch and got a dish with a rotating wild game.  I can't remember the name of it any longer.  The game that day was alligator sausage if I remember correctly, and my table ordered four of them.  One of my friends asked for something to be held out of his.  After some good conversation our food started to arrive.  Strangely, everything but the three unaltered dished with the rotating wild game came.  When our server stopped by he was surprised that they were all missing and went to investigate.  He came back and told us that the printed copy that went to the kitchen was difficult to read and looked like there was only the special request my one friend wanted even though all four were on there.  He rushed the remaining three dishes out, and they were excellent.  When It came time to settle up our tab, our server had the manager take the three delayed meals out.  We didn't ask for that and no one in our group had any kind of complaints about the service.  He got a great tip out of it.  We had a great experience and will definitely be making more trips here."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Try the wings with the brown ale sauce and the outlaw (it's a southwestern burger) They make all the food themselves and it really shows. I found myself scarfing down their homemade catsup with particular vigor, and I'm not a catsup lover... Or even liker. Be sure to get the poptart for desert, it's always good. Of course I have to mention the 31 craft beers on tap and the trendy, hipster ambiance; but honestly I'd come here for any one of these awesome attributes... This place has it all! Want great service? Ask for Cindy. I've sat with her a few times and she always takes great care of me."}
{"text":"Ridiculous selection of beers. Parking is limited but ample street parking nearby. Angels Trumpet has a patio with mist sprayers for hot summer nights."}
{"text":"This place is in A class by itself. Can't compare with anything else in the valley. It's Awsome.  Great food. Clean restrooms. Not to crowded."}
{"text":"Bomb a$$ wings, the \"Mess\" (gravy fries),.place is awesome! Right across from the Film Bar on 2nd St just south of Roosevelt. Dog Friendly! I've taken my Dog here a few times and sat on the Patio,..he LOVES it! Super bizee during 1st FRI. Great Beer,..friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"I live pretty close by so I'm not sure why I didn't try this place sooner! We went on a Saturday afternoon so it was quite busy but not so much that it felt uncomfortable in there.   First, the place is much bigger than I had initially expected and very very good for large groups (I know where I'm having my next birthday!). They offer, I think it was almost 30 at the time, beer choices. I went with a flight so I could try a few different ones I'd been eyeing. They all tasted great but I don't drink quite enough beer that I could really say I knew exactly what I was drinking. Along with the flight, I ordered, \"The Mess,\" which is essentially poutine. It was soooo good! The fries were crunchy, the gravy was stewy, the cheese curds squeaky! Although I made it my meal, it can definitely be shared amongst the table. Also at the table were the well talked about spam sliders and grilled cheese sandwich. All good choices!   Overall, a great experience! I can't wait to come back for a TV dinner Tuesday, another new beer, or a pop tart!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and place to come with your friends!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Chill atmosphere with plenty of beer to choose from. Food is good with good portions. Like that they have wine on tao as well! Definitely a good to!"}
{"text":"Lots of good Oregon beers, should replace Full Sail with Double Mountain.  Food was good.  Fairly high hipster quotient, it'd be right at home in Portland."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer selection & the food was great. With 31 beers on tap this place is for serious beer lovers. They even have 5 wines on tap. The food was great; the wings had 3 different sauces for dipping. The service was prompt & friendly. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"What?!!! Darn, I hate being pressured. Okay, a review. First, somehow, 'my' bartender always recognizes me AND know what I want to order; next, I love love love the clean white tiles for the splash back of the taps; next again, I love the chalkboard of beers on tap; they have a dog friendly OUTdoors patio; the bar has PLENTY of room; the (small) growlers are cute (see the pic); the NAME of the place; the door knob (know knows the significance? It has NOTHING to do with angels); the beautiful cross stich the Fates featured in the hall leading to the water closet; okay, I much prefer incognito, but did I mention my server? Thomas; the food? Every plate that leaves the kitchen/is served to the person sitting near me looks delectable.   Okay--done"}
{"text":"We popped in here for dinner with the fam on First Friday last week and had a good experience! Despite it being PACKED, we were still seated quickly and service was prompt!   We were pretty thirsty so started with beer & wine! If you know much about this lovely place, you know that they have a very impressive beer list! So if you're a beer lover, this is your place. I, however, am not much of a beer drinker so I went with their Pinot Grigio on tap! It was light and refreshing! To start, we all split the pretzels. Oh man, they were hot and delish. They were served with mustard and a beer cheese sauce. For my entree, I got the 810 sammy but swapped the bread for a wrap. It had shaved *smoked* turkey, peppered bacon, avocado mash, pickled red onions, and adobo sauce with pickled jalapenos on the side. I love that they give you the option to have it in a wrap (on request only). It made it a lot lighter! I would for sure order it again.  All in all, this is a fun, trendy spot in Downtown Phoenix to come with friends, coworkers, family, you name it! They have something for everyone, and DEFINITELY will please all of the beer lovers in your group!"}
{"text":"Didn't try the food but it looked great. Super busy when I was there but that just means they're doing something right. The beer on tap was great!"}
{"text":"Great food! We had the Poutine and Spam slides for appetizers and beer. Cool vibes and great local selection."}
{"text":"I like the new kid on the block. Delicious drafts and wine on tap. Great service, nice location, and homemade freaking poptarts. I've gotten entrees and sides, wine and smiles. I am quite satisfied with this place. That is why it has earned my five."}
{"text":"I've never seen so many beers in my life. And try the tacos stuffed with mashed sweet potatoes, green chilis and cheese.  YUM!  The place was packed on a Saturday afternoon and now I know why.  So many more things to try on our next visit AND definitely a lot more beer to try!  I loved my beer, its #31...some Pilsner thing.  Perfect for me."}
{"text":"Great food, lots of great beer and I think the prices are really good. We always feel we've gotten good value from our experience there."}
{"text":"Beer selection was excellent with 31 micro brews. No bud light here. Great happy hour with $3 for 3 diff local beers.  Homemade pbj, grilled cheese and moose drool ale wings. The deserts are most impressive with home made pop tarts and salted flat bread with house made peanut butter house made marshmallows Dark chocolate chunks and honey drizzle"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great service and great beer! It's such a fun atmosphere and popular with the locals. They even have a lawn to play corn hole!"}
{"text":"Such an awesome joint! They have one of the best salads (for a person that is TRYING, to eat healthy) and the most ridiculously delicious burgers (for someone who doesn't care about their weight aka: my husband). We've tried multiple burgers, deserts, and drinks, and they have all been yummy. Definitely love there home made ketchup and different take on ranch! We'll need to head over again real soon!"}
{"text":"It's a great restaurant - plenty of space, lots of open architecture and multiple places to see what the drink options are and how they change. The food...fantastic. Parking can be tricky but if you're willing to walk a bit, you'l find something."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now.  It's pretty much the closest thing to a microbrewery you'll find in downtown Phoenix.  Tons of beers (and some wines) on tap and the choices always rotate.  This time around I got a Hefe from a brewer in the Czech Republic.  For lunch I got what was essentially a BLT on steroids with super thick bacon, lettuce, tomato, as well as pesto.  Really nice compliment to the beer.  The place wasn't too busy since its a Saturday afternoon, but I'm told this place is packed with downtown workers during weekday happy hours.  They have a nice outdoor patio that is ideal when the weather permits, though I kind of wish they'd put something else out there like cornhole toss, a live music stage, or something along those lines.  Overall, the food is pretty good and the service I've gotten here is pretty friendly.  The food and ambiance won't knock your socks off, but the beer selection is really hard to beat.  Nice to have a decent brewpub downtown."}
{"text":"Maybe I shouldn't have had such high expectations. I was so stoked on coming to this Ale House. I have had it on my \"to-do list\" for about a year. When I finally got the opportunity, I was super disappointed. I did really like the building and the bar set-up, the atmosphere was alright, the patio was pretty cute, but nothing special. Just like everything else.   To start, they didn't have the first 2 beer's I asked for. The 2 Sour's that were on their tap that evening were out. The bar tender handed me 2 samples \"Here try these.\" I thought. Ohhh well that was nice of him. Well... lucky for him I am not very picky. The beers he handed me were NOTHING like Sour's. Not even Ciders. I'm pretty sure they were Pale Ales. Ok, whatever. So I picked one of them.   When we were seated it didn't take long for the server to see us and our friends. Pretty friendly guy. But that was the end of that. Our server was hard to track down the rest of the evening. Especially at the end of our meal, when it came time to pay. We sat there for a good 20 Minutes, we waited to catch him and ask for our checks.  The food was probably the most disappointing part for me. The best thing I had was The Mess: house fries, brown gravy & fresh local cheddar cheese curds. But even these were lacking of much needed flavor. The Cheese Curds were the best part. Salty and creamy. For our meals, my husband and I split both the Bbq Brisket Grilled Cheese: root beer braised brisket, pickled onion, tomato, smoked mozzarella, fontina, house bbq sauce  And the Nutter: house ground peanut butter with raspberry chipotle preserves & banana. The Brisket Grilled Cheese, #1 Where's the cheese!? Nowhere to be found. The BBQ sauce was gross. Not tangy or spicy, just bla... The Brisket itself was fine. And then for the Nutter, no flavor. Just nope. I had such high hopes. Dashed...  And here's a pro-tip. NO TALKING, you won't be heard. This place is SO LOUD.   I may have set my bar and expectations too high.  If I do go again, I know what to expect. And that is that."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place and I cannot wait to go back. So many amazing beer choices and the food is fluffing good. Thank you for an experience like no other."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool, not sure about the food.  When we got there it was not even 6pm and our server told us they were out of Spud Tacos and he would let us know how long before they made more.  We got a flight of beers.  I only liked 2 of the six he selected.  I am not a beer drinker, I like them light and not too hoppy or lemony.  After about 20 minutes we saw another server and asked her to inquire how long before the Spud Tacos were available again.  She came back and said 45 minutes, wow.  How long does it take to cook sweet potatoes in their kitchen?  We were not going to wait for them and we were glad because I read the review on the New Times about an hour later and it was not glowing.  I think this place has potential.  It is a little bit too noisy, I think they should consider putting some noise absorbing tiles."}
{"text":"I came here about a year ago with a few brothers and a cousin. This place had a delicious burger, had some type of Spanish meat or something. I spent about 1 hour trying to locate this place on yelp, finally found it! Great atmosphere and I'm coming back soon for that burger!"}
{"text":"If it's a Tuesday and I'm in Phoenix, then I'll be at Angels Trumpet for TV dinner night. For $8, you get the most amazing selection of dishes. Each week is a different creation. Last week I had meatballs, pesto pasta, mushroom salad, garlic bread, with a cannoli cheesecake. Even if I'm not in town, I check the Facebook page each Tuesday to see the TV dinner meal.  On days other than Tuesday, I enjoy the pizzas. My favorite is the Tractor with 2 eggs, bacon and a variety of cheeses.   The continually rotating beer list is always top notch. Great variety and selection from breweries around the country. If there are a couple I have my eye on, the beer flight is a good option.  Always a great meal and drinks at Angels Trumpet!"}
{"text":"I have a hard time deciding what to write about Angels Trumpet, not being a fan of beer, it's hard to give any of the breweries around town a fair shake. On their menu they've got items like spam sliders, home made pop tarts, flatbread pizza. Their beer menu is lovingly written on chalkboards around the bar and there's a huge ton amount of them; a real measurement BTW, look it up in any engineering book, if you can't find it right away, just keep looking.  Again, while we've already established I don't really love beer, I have partook from time to time, it's unavoidable when all your friends are doin it ;-)  I do enjoy their tasty salads, have sampled a number of other items from the menu and have never experienced anything I wouldn't order again; except for maybe that weird dessert pizza thing. It's like a big mixture of things from around your kitchen that you would make and scarf down when you've had one or two-welve to many. I love the hip downtown atmosphere and it's a great spot to gather with friends or randomly run into them, cause everyone is usually already there.  Happy Yelping Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Second visit, solo this time. I arrived at 11:30 on a Wednesday and there were a dozen diners. I was greeted right away with ice water.   They had big wooden tables inside and out, plus seating for 20 at the bar. The loud music was popular 70's rock, like WHAM and the Police. Their beer selection was incredible, with over 100 beers available.   I ordered the Porky Sandwich, with fries for $11.95. Since I was working I had to eschew the ale.   My lunch arrived in 11 minutes.   The sandwich was served on toasted sourdough, with lettuce and spread, with homemade ketchup on the side. The ketchup was more like a BBQ sauce, which was better.   The fries were hand cut, seasoned little gems of yummy.   I still can't find any issues with this place, which is awesome."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.   Terrific atmosphere, great beer selections and amazing food.   Love that they have the revolving beer list so each time I come I can have something new.   The food is terrific. You have to try the homemade pop tarts. Looking for a good sandwich? Try the 810 with the pickled jalapeños.   This place is exactly what downtown Phoenix needed."}
{"text":"Angels?!?!?! Trumpets!??!? Count me in!  We decided to continue the night of fun and games at this place as:  1. It has beer 2. They VERY have flights 3. They are open late for those of us that are night owls  We arrived and the place was pretty much clearing out. The first thing you notice is the dozens of beers written on the chalkboard, the tell-tale signs of a hipster joint. The staff seated us promptly and we had a chance to look around at the pretty standard Oak table decor, with a jukebox machine thrown in \"just because.\"   Since we were waiting we went ahead and looked at the board for our flight selection. For those that don't know what a \"flight\" is, you choose 6 beers and they serve them all at once in glasses. Simply put, it's a beer tasting except you drink it all. I order all the strongest beer on the menu because...I'm dead inside and have nothing better to do.  They also make home made poptarts which of course I had to try. The poptart comes with a bowl of vanilla ice cream as well. For some odd reason it took like 30 minutes for my poptart to come and another 10 for them to bring the ice cream after I reminded the waitress after one of her long disappearing acts.  I seriously couldn't finish the flight, but it was great! My stomach was so full of liquor and food from the night I could only finish 3.5 glasses (and just sipped the rest.)  Overall, good quality and they give you value for your alcohol consumption. My friends even found a beer that they've been searching for a vendor back in Chicago for months now since we visited this place! Would love to try a couple flights next time.  4 out of 5 stars"}
{"text":"First off the food and beer selection was 5 stars. All of that was great. We ordered the pretzels, the poutine and the quesadilla special and it was all fantastic.  However, Im sad to say that the service was 1 star. Right after our food was delivered she did come ask how it was and then we didnt see her again. About 10 minutes into our food my husband was ready for another beer and i was out of water. We saw her going back and forth to other tables but she was not close enough for us to get her attention.  It was awkward because we spent the rest of our meal debating: do we go ask the bartender, do we keep trying to make eye contact? We didnt want to come across as rude but we probably should have just gone to the bar.   Eventually, she and i made eye contact and her expression let me know that she had forgotten us and she rushed right over. Unfortunately, we had been done for a while so we ordered some poptarts to go and left.   We are definitely going to go back. Hopefully the service experience was just a fluke. Everything else was really great."}
{"text":"Now that I've had time to reflect on my recent visit I've decided overall I did enjoy my experience here.  At first I was a little put off by the crowd but I now realize it was a based off a preconceived notion I had based completely off the location and building.    The food was very good, the service was great and I love how close it is.  I will give this place another try in the near future."}
{"text":"Great selection of craft taps, 31 that rotate frequently. Friendly staff, clean easy atmosphere. Ample parking. Home-made pop tarts for dessert! What's not to love!"}
{"text":"Shit man, I would totes give a better review, but with over 400 reviews you don't really need to know this place is pretty awesome. I came in thinking I was going to have a couple beers and some good food. I had exactly that... Okay I had few more beers and some food. I left with three growlers of the strawberry blonde microbrew, excellent! The waiter suggested the fish tacos which my friend got, they were okay. I got the brisket tacos which were amazing. This is my new favorite place in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe the antithesis of Scottsdale. An amazing,eclectic selection of beers. Nice outdoor patio. If you're downtown, don't miss this beer lovers  hangout. Have not eaten here but food looks and smells delicious"}
{"text":"Nice place to meet up with friends and have a few good beers. The chalk boards list over 20 different taps, and they have a nice selection of local craft beers on tap. The food is good here but the last two times I went I got the Cashew Butter and Jelly sandwich, and its the best-est!  Angels Trumpet Ale House fills growlers"}
{"text":"First time we went, it was five star experience. Great food, great service, awesome beer list, strawberry pop tart... We went back this weekend and it was pretty much the opposite experience. Service was terrible - she never offered me a beer after our flight and I couldn't ever catch her, we didn't care for any of the beers and the \"special\" burrito I tried was gross and missing half of the ingredients - too bad nobody came back to check or I would have sent it back... This place is always packed, you're gonna wait - check out tap hunter first and make sure you like what beers are on the menu. Its a cool place, we just won't be back anytime soon. Oh and if you can't see from a distance, bring your glasses/binoculars, the beer list is only on the wall."}
{"text":"Come thirsty y'all.  Tons of draft beer to choose from and if beer ain't your thing they have a handful of wine on tap as well.  But flights of beer is their signature order.   Unfortunately the 10\" pizza we had was bland but you're coming here for beer which will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I have hit this place a few times for lunch, and have been impressed every time. The food is top notch and they have a great selection of beer on tap. The patio is always a great spot to hang out on. I have to say, this is turning into my go to spot for lunch."}
{"text":"As strange as this review might be, I am completely a fan!    We stopped here near the end of our First Friday night out with friends.  It was insanely packed and so we grabbed a couple chairs in the back corner.  Our waitress was still very accommodating and served us quickly with beer and drinks.  Don't ask me which of the many beers we ordered because I can't remember...  ...Because all I can remember is how insanely divine and delicious our dessert was!  We ordered the salted caramel flatbread that came highly recommended to us by a friend (see my picture I posted, #147).  It is completely homemade on a nice thin crispy flatbread.  Peanut Butter.  Caramel.  Marshmallow fluff.  Chocolate Chips.  Honey.  Pretzels.  If you aren't drooling yet, I feign to say there might be something wrong with your salivary glands or taste-buds.    I want to head back sometime to soon to try their beer, TV dinner night, and enjoy a table with some good friends.  I'm a fan Angels!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pre-movie dinner for party of two. Started with a flight off their large selection of brews and proceeded to share a steak sandwich and a hot mess. Both great choices and large portions perfect for sharing. Always a ++ with the pet friendly patios!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for every reason. Music, Food and the ever growing beer menu. Only thing is hipsters gravitate to places like these."}
{"text":"Simply the Best and perhaps most daring and creative Pub style food on planet earth!  Well, maybe just Phoenix but I promise, you will NOT be disappointed!  The vibe and beer selection is simply out of sight!"}
{"text":"Great chic bar atmosphere.  There are 30+ beers on tap that change when the keg runs out. The food is also really good. From the appetizers (we got the chicken wings, hummus and pretzel bites) and then there are flat breads and sandwiches (the basic grilled cheese can have the spam or bacon added on, and the nutter (pb&j with banana slices)). There is a whole back outside area (they have corn hole set up in the back and outdoor seating). Better food recently than what has been in the past. I would definitely come here, again!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! And good beer! We are already planning our trip back.    We tried \"the mess\" appetizer, fries with gravy and cheese curds, and it was great! Big portion so the three of us couldnt even finish it!   My girlfriend got the flight of beers and said its a great option to try some of all the different kinds they had.   We also had the fish tacos, the tractor flatbread, and the chet burrito. We were raving about everything!    We also got thw rum mango poptarts and holy crap it was heaven in a pastry. 10/10 would recommend   Service was a little slow, but it was a busy dinner time so its understandable, I think its a great place to take friends or grab dinner"}
{"text":"One of the most diverse beer selections in AZ.  Friendly service.  Very good food as well, I had the \"810\" sandwich that was very tasty.  Nice local people doing a great thing."}
{"text":"We came in on a Sunday afternoon after a spring training game. We were impressed on their space and beer selection.  I had a beer flight, $10 for 6- 3oz. pours, a great price as they don't have restrictions or upcharges for pricier beers.  Location-close to downtown.  Parking- metered only, $1.50/hr. Inside- nice size bar, open main area inside with large patio.  Ambience- decent/chill, not loud or rowdy A big Con was the limited and pricey food menu. We really wanted to snack on something but nothing looked appetizing or worth the price. Overall, still would definately return for the great beer selection."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday after a game.Big beer selection and nice looking menu. I was surprised  and disappointed that our sever didn't seem to know anything about the beers. I was seated in a place where I really couldn't read the chalkboard beer list. The food was pretty good, but maybe have a printed beer menu with some descriptions."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Angels Trumpet for years, until last night. I always come in with my pets. We sit in the patio. Last night I invited two of my friends as well with their own dogs. We waited 45 minutes to even talk to a server after being seated. We asked multiple times about our server and told that your server will be right with you. Never received water, asked for a order, nothing. We watched while 3 other tables that came in after us were seated and served. Made an attempt to speak to multiple servers around us at other tables and mostly ignored. Finally I decided I did not want to give my money to anyone there that night so we got up and left. Very sad since I enjoy the food and beer selection very much. I guess I will be finding somewhere else to fill my growler."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! HUGE selection of local and out-of-town draft beers, awesome food menu with things like burgers & flatbreads, great outdoor patio area, near downtown. Parking can be a challenge and you'll probably wait for a bit, but grab a beer & wait outside. Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"That Chix sandwhich looked beautiful and was slammin'! The homemade ketchup with the fries I didnt really care for. Would have liked more ranch on the sandwhich, but it was still good. The cider of the day was kickin! Not a fan of that cookie dough pinwheel dessert, the \"high roller\". It tasted raw. 4 stars for that cider!"}
{"text":"This new restaurant is great for downtown! The service and food were exceptional. My husband loved the \"flight\". We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My first time here, tried a variety of craft beers, my random selections looked like every color to the beer rainbow; there's one named after one of David Bowie's classic hits. The Jefferson quesadilla was really tasty-- should have ordered two . The patio ambiance was beautiful at night looking at the top of the skyline, waitstaff and bartender folk were very sweet and genuine.  I didn't know that the Film Bar's directly across the street from it. Ya vohl, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Service has improved immensely. Food always amazing and beer selection is what brings me here most days. Thank you!"}
{"text":"It was fine, but it isn't the kind of place I normally go for lunch.  The food was a little out there for my taste."}
{"text":"The outlaw burger may have changed my life. Awesome food and even better beer. XXV from North Coast, CA is excellent. Great little joint. We were in and out quickly and everyone enjoyed the experience. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place. This is always the place I come to whenever I meet up with friends that are from out of town. Their wide selection of beer is great, and the food never disappoints! I always get really good service when I go there too which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great beer options--especially when you're able to get the flight. The cookies are amazing, as well as the pizzas!"}
{"text":"I thought this restaurant was overhyped for what it was. The poutine was very underwhelming and the spam slider were not very impressing. The service was good though, maybe the kitchen crew just had a bad day."}
{"text":"I love Angels Trumpet . That's why I'm giving a 4 star review. I go there fairly regularly and always have enjoyed good service, great food and a pleasant experience. However, yesterday I visited there with a friend who has been a long time,very regular customer of theirs and this time the service was not up to par. We had a dog with us and so we were on the patio sitting in the chairs at the edge of the patio and no one came to take our order or even say hello! There were three other tables on the patio when we came in and as we sat there one left,  it was a very slow time of day . The two servers on the patio  kept looking at us but they never came over finally my friend got their attention and the young man said oh sorry, I'll get your order but just so you know we don't normally wait on people when they're sitting here normally you would go to the bar and I asked him how I would do that since I had a dog and the bar is inside. He didn't answer. My friend went inside and just ordered from the bartender and bypassed the waiter. If they have a rule that certain seating on the patio is only for patrons who order at the bar there should be some kind of sign there because we had no idea that was how we were supposed to order. It's a dog-friendly patio so this doesn't seem to mesh. By the way the bartender gave us excellent service!"}
{"text":"I was able to get six Saison and/or Belgian biers in my flight. I think they had like 37 beers on tap that night plus 8 wines. Friendly clientele. Very good sausage platter"}
{"text":"This is by far the best place in phnx!!! I come here as often as possible and I live in the far East valley... they have this chef named Ben,  who, from every time I've been there has shown the food nothing but love, delicious we had this madator, brisket sandwich... I can't even begin to explain how amazing it was, smoke for e 12+ hour it was great, I've been lucky every time I come in the same guy \" Ben \" ironically same name as the chef\" had been behind the bar and takes us on a tour of the country and craft beers, dudes an ace when it comes to good beer, today he recommended the \" Thai speedway \" from alesmith, ca.... such a delicious craft, if you're in the area this place NEVER DISSAPOINTS!!! The owners obviously are doing something right.... can we get a location in the east valley!!!???? Please!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"BEST BEER SELECTION, house-made everything and a fun atmosphere, especially if you want to bring your dogs.   Get the wings (order them extra crispy) with the Moose Drool sauce and the wild game sausage platter.  Their rootbeer beef tacos are delicious, and the fish taco portion for the price is crazy!  This is our go-to spot to bring visiting friends and family."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere here, and the beer list isn't too shabby, either. Boasting around 30 taps, and most are not just your local beers like SanTan and Four Peaks like a lot of bars around the area. This place has a great selection, especially if you are a beer snob like me. For the food, we only tried dessert, but the homemade pop-tarts are amazing! Don't leave without trying some. The rest of the menu looked good as well, and we'll definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"Just gotta love this place!  Love the beer sampler.  You can try so many different types of beers I've never even heard of.  Now I have about a dozen new favorites.  Great time, every time!"}
{"text":"I want to say I love it because the atmosphere is incredible and theres a huge beer selection but...I've never found a beer that was truly great and I'm a beer guy.  Also, the food is pretty mehhh.  However, it's a great spot in a good area and a great spot to start a friday night.  Definitely don't write it off."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place in Downtown PHX.  They are always rotating kegs out so there are always so many new beers to choose from.  Their wings tossed in hot sauce are definitely the best you can get downtown.  They also have TV Dinner Tuesday, where they serve a special meal in a TV dinner style plate.  Can be very busy, especially when it's nice out so plan on possibly waiting to sit."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today. Now I see what all the love is about. Great service, amazing selection to drink, loved the wings. The Cherry Bomb cider was soooo good. Will be a regular spot from now on."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection.  Food was pretty good too. Something like 32 beers on tap.  Will go again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer.  Just awesome selection and superb service.  Would definitely recommend for foodies, beer snobs, and folks looking for a cool place downtown.  Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Just loved this place.  They know their beer and were able to make some great suggestions for me....because I don't know my beer.  My husband and I drank a beer or two and then turned to the menu.  It's fairly simple fare, but boy do they put a spin on it.  The sandwiches each of us ordered were unique and very very tasty.  The home made potato chips are divine, and my husband was really pleased that his coleslaw was delicious and the portion was large (unlike so many places that give you a tiny amount of  your side dish).  My only suggestion would be that the beers be offered in a larger size.  It was explained to us that, due to the alcohol content, the beer is served in a smaller glass - but it was a little frustrating to hubby to not get a larger amount ---the beer is THAT good.  Keep up the good work, Angels Trumpet Ale House.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Super good food! Flat bread pizza, awesome! Got to get the Mess too! Oh and Really great beer selection!"}
{"text":"Walked up on this place during a weekend pub crawl. Didn't regret it. The food is spot on and their beer options are insane lol. Friends got me to try the spam sliders here (first time spam eater) and they did not disappoint. Their pizzas are on point as well. Good ambience. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great beer and good food had gaucho tacos liked them but not loved, pretzels were ok and nuttie flatbread was a very good dessert!"}
{"text":"We stopped here before going to FilmBar, which is a cool experience (think Bar + Movie Theatre, but of an independent style).  Angels has an extensive beer list and fairly solid menu.  The demographics are artsy/hipster in this \"North Phoenix\" enclave, near downtown.   The spam sliders were incredible; also, I highly recommend the \"Elvis-Type\" sandwich."}
{"text":"LOCALLY owned & operated. (seriously, I touched the Owner!)  We like the Staff here, they are cool and friendly but not overly obsequious  like some pretentious downtown joints where they must have an a** kissing contest for TIPS going on.  PRETZELS are da bomb.  I had to alternate between the cheese dip and the spicy mustard with every other bite. Super Tasty! WINGS really nicely seasoned, NOT greasy. Meaty. Takes a little tooth action to strip them from the bone in a really good way, I think at one point I growled!  Spousal Unit reported his BURGER was high quality beef, well seasoned, cooked to order (still mooing) and the bun held up under the meaty pressure. My FISH TACOS were presented with just the right amount of black beans, some awesome spicy coleslaw and fresh avocado mash.  Fresh tortillas and nice flaky fried (deal with it) fish in just the right proportions.  The Beer?  But of course. Interesting. Worth doing a FLIGHT but ask for help, don't load up on all one style and miss the fun-fest in your mouth that comes from variety!"}
{"text":"Good food and drinks. Huge variety of beers. Could use more healthy options on menu. A fun and progressive atmosphere; a great casual place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Food is really good. Nice open atmosphere.  TERRIBLE SERVICE. That's the biggest turn off at a restaurant that is border line great. Their horrible service is the only factor that stops me from becoming a true regular here. And I don't mean regular by Yelp's standards. I've checked in twice so now I'm a Yelp regular.    I will be back because the good food and big beer selection, I just really hope they step up their service game."}
{"text":"Just a solid place for food and beer. Great beer selection. Some are definitely offbeat, so I love the sampler option (six decent sized pours). We went on Tuesday to enjoy TV Dinner night. It was an interesting mix of food - chipotle mac and cheese, salad, rice and beans, biscuit and a margarita dessert bar. Definitely carb heavy, but a great deal for $9. Had to try to the homemade Pop Tart - blueberry with a balsamic rosemary reduction drizzle. So delicious. I was stuffed but could not stop eating it. Comfortable, laid back setting, nice patio, friendly service. A great stop before a downtown event."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite spots downtown! They have a great beer selection -- 31 taps that are always new and changing (they list them online too, which is nice). I love the atmosphere and both the indoor and outdoor seating. We've been lucky a couple of times and have sat at the half in/half out tables, and those are great :) the service is always amazing too, we've never had a long wait for anything.   Their Outlaw burger is one of the best BBQ burgers that I've had, and I've had a lot. The only thing I haven't liked that much so far is their salad, but I definitely want to try more things on the menu! My boyfriend likes the wings a lot and my sister has told me that the Bug Guppy fish tacos and margarita pizza (might only be on the happy hour menu) are amazing.   The parking lot is super small so it's hard to get a space at night, but there are tons of metered spots nearby! It's definitely worth the walk over. If you come here for dinner or drinks, definitely go across the street and check out Cobra Arcade! :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a pint and a bite.  Great bartenders!  Told them what beer I liked and they gave suggestions for my next (with tastes first to be sure before I ordered a full pint).  The matador brisket sandwich on pretzel roll was amazing.  Two thumbs way up from me!!"}
{"text":"man do i love this place.  excellent and always diverse selection of beer available.  the crowd is a mellow bunch and it's downtown location is really ideal.   the food selection is minimal but the flat breads and pretzels are really tasty.  perfect place to go if you're looking for some really unique beers and a great relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this new place in downtown Phoenix!  The atmosphere is really cool; however, the acoustics are not good (only negative about this place).  The service was extremely friendly and helpful with recommendations.  The food was quite good and reasonably priced too...check out the grilled cheese and the chet - both delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place and great food! I tried it during a First Friday event. Very good choice."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. Great view of the city. Really enjoy the beer and food selection. My only complaint was that the last time they were there it just wasn't properly staffed. It was a beautiful day (and perhaps it's having lived in Chicago for 9 years and suffering through cold where when it got nice EVERYONE was outside), but if I had a restaurant I would assume everyone would be out and on my patio. The servers were working extremely hard, but there just weren't enough of them."}
{"text":"Well yes once again great food and of course great beer selection had the wings with the 3 dipping sauces... Sat at the bar the bar tender dude was a complete dud ..... Ya that's dud not dude 0 personality when I asked for a recommendation on a beer he muttered a few thoughts not that I could hear him or understand him  ........ Not a people person I guess...zzzzzz usually we've always had great fun service"}
{"text":"What a fun place!!   I don't drink beer, but I got the chocolate beer. wow!  I loved it! Four of us shared  5 appetizers.  They were so good!  We got 2 different types of the riblets, the pretzels, a trio of taquitos, wings. Our server was so nice!  He was full of information. You are missing out if you don't try it!"}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewers the service is subpar, and I sat at the bar. The beers are good, but the board(of beers on the wall) is lacking in details I want to know when doing a tasting. The restaurant also feels kind of empty. I know their going with a minimalist theme, but it's a little over the top."}
{"text":"Husband ordered: brulee beef burger w/medium over easy egg w/ fries which came with a special dipping sauce.  Me: 810 Sammy w/fries Toddler: cheese pizza Beer: AZ red ale My husband Loved his burger! It was huge so definitely filling. He said it was very flavorful the bacon was crispy, the green leaf lettuce was just a great combination for this juicy burger. I liked my Sammy - it was different, not bad simply good. The adobo sauce was good but I don't know maybe it was too smoky for my taste buds. My toddler had the cheese pizza. I have to say none of us liked the dipping sauce - tasted more like marinara sauce. we would have preferred ketchup, but regardless it didn't take away from this place or food.  We like the decor and it keeps a cool temp inside which is nice because of the az heat!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, beer and service on those things alone it is 5 stars but was not impressed with the food and the table had 4 different dishes.  That being said the fries were awesome.  This place was packed and people love it but the burrito and the Matador sandwich were very average."}
{"text":"Always fun to explore the beer selection at this place. They change it often. the place has a trendy vibe. being close to downtown, on most evening finding parking can be a challenge. Food is creative and presentation is fun. I am big fan of the grilled cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"I love Angels Trumpet! I've tried a bunch of different items in my few visits, and they've all been fantastic. Couple the great food with their superb beer selection, and you've got a winning combo.  I can vouch for their burgers, fries, house-made pop tarts, and the \"Nutter\" sandwich (get it with marshmallow fluff too!). Those are all sure-bet items, and some of the tastiest things that exist in the Valley. *These may in fact be my favorite french fries around now too. Top notch.  The only thing wrong with ATAH is that it needs a bug lamp or two. There are way too many flies buzzing around."}
{"text":"Had the most AMAZING grilled cheese with bacon jam!! Don't miss out on this treat! Great beer selection, friendly service, and the food was beyond excellent. Appetizer wings exceeded expectations and my boyfriend had the burrito with homemade pork rinds, which were both super tasty. Will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday this past Friday for the first time, as this is a regular hangout for her; I see why! Sizable back area, with heaters to keep the temperature just right. They also have an area for your dog, if you bring them along. Beer selection is rather extensive, food is great! Sampled a friend's pizza which, albeit was on the greasy side, was still delectable. The pouting was tasty, although the gravy could have used a bit less salt. Overall, would love to head back here again, maybe during the Summer.."}
{"text":"Not only does this place have a fantastic beer selection but their lunch and food is super solid.  Had the 810 turkey sandwich it was fantastic great flavor fries were fried perfectly and love the house make ketchup, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Just finished up with their smoked pork and chicken enchiladas, green chile corn bread topped with white bean chorizo, Arizona rice with smoked onion and charred tomato (best rice I've had in a LONG time) and finished it all off with a scoop of fried ice cream w/ sugar puffs and ganache that they kindly kept in the cooler until we were finished with our meal since we were on their patio.   One of the best TV dinners I've had here.  Chef Travis is a great new addition!   Washed it all down with a couple tasty Joseph James NV Collaboration Imperial IPA's and an Avery Samael Barleywine.  Service was awesome with Cyndy and support of Josh, Nicole & Amy all lending a helping hand."}
{"text":"Actual rating would be 3 stars. Here's the deal. Great beer, not so great service. I have been here lots and have had maybe one server who knew something about the great stuff they have on tap. Do not trust them for a recommendation. This can easily be fixed with training. It hasn't.  The bigger issue is this business's role in killing the Roosevelt BID. Furthermore, arguing that they MADE the area worth coming to when the arts community has worked for decades to bring people to downtown Phoenix. Owners are pompous and show a disregard for other local businesses. If you want to support local (which I hope you do), please look elsewhere. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Once again this place has made me happy.  I wish they were closer.  The tractor pizza is so amazing."}
{"text":"Our first time was an overall good experience. The beers were tasty...the selection is awesome! The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. The atmosphere was pretty cool...loved our seats at the bar! The food was Meh (I've experienced better!!). Not what I was expecting when the food came out as everything else at this place rocked!! I got the fries/brown gravy/cheese curds plate. There were like 4 cheese curds on the plate and the fries were soggy and not that good. They did not have an condiment options other than their \"homemade ketchup\" that wasn't even close to ketchup. My husband had an Italian wrap and he didn't care for it either. If we go back...I'll be just drinking...not eating."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time yesterday. I had the bison dog with fries. I thought the food was really good. The one downfall, I got the homemade ketchup with the fries, It was o.k. it tasted more like thick marinara sauce than ketchup.   The service was pretty good, and I was happy with the large selection of beers they had to try. Some of the descriptions could have been a little better on the board so you had a better idea of what you were getting."}
{"text":"Being from the Northwest, finding a good ale house with a wide assortment of excellent beers is hard to find. Most ale houses in Phoenix offer many local choices. It's great to support local brewers, but it's also great to see what the rest of the world has to offer. This place offers a great environment and beer menu to go with it. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. It has an amazing beer selection and it is new every time. They currently have 31 beers on tap! They also have 6 wines on tap. All the food we have had has been really good. Their pizza is great! The only reason I give it a 4 star is because they don't have a happy hour and it is pretty pricey."}
{"text":"We visited here in the afternoon before heading to a friend's wedding later that day.  It was exactly what we were looking for, and it gives me hope for the Phoenix area.  The downtown area is a huge contrast to the urban sprawl of the rest of the Phoenix metro area.  We didn't have any food on this visit, but it looked really good.  The beer list was impressive, a good variation in type of beer and brewery location.  I tried the Dragoon 3 Goons Belgian Tripel, The Petrus Aged Red sour ale, and the Founders Porter. They had good music and a lot of seating, including a great outdoor patio."}
{"text":"I just want Angels to know how happy they made me by sitting my party down 10 minutes before kitchen closing and making my poptart demand happen! Excellent customer service. I've heard great things about this place and they were definitely up to par. Desserts are my life and their simple gesture of willingly taking me in at last call to get me what I wanted on a busy Friday night meant a great deal to me. All the staff I encountered were warm, friendly and attentive. I love the vibe and homey feeling of the whole restaurant. I will update next time I come in and try the food. But these stars are well deserved already."}
{"text":"Been here a few times the last year and just leaving as I write this review! This place is great as I usually go here in tandem with Cobra Arcade.This place has a vast beer selection and there is usually something new, so if you are the adventures type this is definitely a spot to check out. The food I would say is okay as it is the typical American dishes with a hipster twist, but with the pretty awesome atmosphere and the selection of drinks it is definitely a must spot to go to if you're around the Roosevelt area. Check it!"}
{"text":"We usually stop at Angels Trumpet when we go to First Fridays. Impressive beers on tap - around 30 rotating beers. Food is pretty good. I really like their fries. I'm intrigued by their tv dinner tray specials - will eventually have to make it there to try it one day.   Discovered a little fun fact on my visit this past Saturday (first visit not on First Friday), they close at 12am. I really assumed they would've been open til 2am on weekends, nope.  Also, we made it in just 20 minutes before closing this past visit and got poor service from one of the bartenders. She seemed very annoyed by our presence and was very rude in her response to our questions. Also had a resting bitch face on the entire time. So, I'd suggest not to bother them anytime before closing."}
{"text":"Huge beer selection of rare beers, knolwedgebell and freindly staff, a great patio all add up to a good place.  Beers range $5-8 a glass so it is on the pricier end, however most of the beers are higher end micro brews. Our server was well versed in the brews and brewries which is nice when you are spening as much as a lunch on a single beer.   The patio has many tables as does the inside, making it acceptable for larger groups (6-10 people). There is also plenty of spance to stand around and drink.    They do have a full menu of intresting food items but I was just here to enjoy the beer this trip."}
{"text":"Do you like a large selection of non-traditional beers? Then I say YES! That is all - check this place out."}
{"text":"I think Angels Trumpet House may be my first love.   Everything about this place is just a YES! The food is soooo delicious and they aren't afraid to switch things up. I've had their burgers, chicken sandwiches, wings, and taquitos. Those huge taquitos are something amazing, try them! They also have this grilled cheese sandwich that you can add Spam to. Sign me up for three of them!  HUGE beer selection that is always changing. They also have wine, too!  The place is open late and serves until about 11pm on the weekdays, not sure about the weekends?   GO HERE. EAT ALL THE FOOD. DRINK ALL THE BEER."}
{"text":"Every time I come here this place blows my mind! The beer and ale selection is fantastic and challenging. I feel like a better, more educated beer drinker when I leave. The food is F'n amazing. Pardon my French. The flatbread pizza, pretzels, spam sliders and burgers are amazing and the menu is constantly evolving. I live out of state but whenever I'm in Phoenix, I'm here. Cheers mate!"}
{"text":"Great food and beer selection with a cool relaxed atmosphere. The avocado salad with smoked turkey was superb as was the 810. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Definitely a solid selection of beer, loved the rotating board of choices! Everything we tried was delicious.   Brewlee and Outlaw burgers delivered with sweet and savory flavors but both were rarer than they should have been. Would want to come back and try TV dinner night with some friends."}
{"text":"Angels Trumpet is a really cool place to grab a microbrew, and the food is good too!  They have a great selection of beers on tap and they always have new stuff to try.   The staff is very knowledgeable makes good recommendations on the fly.  Grab some friends, sit on the back patio, enjoy the view, and try a new brew."}
{"text":"We decided to stop at this hidden little brew pub to see what they had on tap.  We were downtown Phoenix checking out what they call the art district. There are old house converted into cool new repurposwd builings.  There is cool painted murals all over this area.  When we were done looking we decided to stop here for a beer or two.  We got seated right away and sat at a table.  We each orderd flights so we could try several new beers.  Each flight was 6 beers.  They had like 40-50 different craft beers on tap to choose from.  We had already eaten so we didnt order any food.  I will say though everything coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled amazing.  Before leaving my brother orderd an apple pop tart or strudle as a dessert.  This was homemade and very good.   We recommend everyone to try one of these before leaving...."}
{"text":"Really came here for the beer in all honesty, but the food was good and the service was great. Our server came by and checked on us \"just enough\" so as not to be annoying, I.e. our glasses were always full and we never had to look for refills etc. if you weren't specifically searching this place out you might drive right past it. Great hidden gem in downtown Phoenix. I plan to be back as the menu is inviting and my friends' food looked delicious. I had the spam sliders and they were delicious."}
{"text":"In from Dallas and our party sampled several items on the menu, not one wasn't excellent. This place is amazing and will be an automatic every time we're back in Phoenix. Our server was very helpful and made our visit here that much better. If we could have given 10 stars we would have !"}
{"text":"Love this place. They have a great selection of beer and on top of that they have my favorite beer! A Belgium while ale! So delicious! We were too hungry so we decided to ask the waitress which appetizer to get and she recommended the chips and salsa. It was so good, they make everything in house. Can't wait to come back and try other things in the menu."}
{"text":"Great craft beer restaurant. They have a chalk board with hundreds of beers on tap. I usually get a flight and let the waiter pick for me. All of the staff seems very knowledgeable. Love the food too!"}
{"text":"Beer and spam. Let's goo!  I wanted to go here for a while and happened to walk in with some friends, not knowing the name. I looked at all of the different beers, the cool patio and interesting menu. Finally someone told me where we were and it all came together! This is a very cool spot, fairly unassuming from the outside. Once you're in, they have TONS of craft brews from across the country. Take your out-of-town friends here. Each have a decent alcohol percentage, so watch yourself.  There is a good assortment of interesting items on the menu, including spam! Other dishes are pretty creative and add to the mystique of the place.  I wasn't able to spend much time here but can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Business did not consider party within \"ale house\" standards. Did not and will not compensate them for disrespect."}
{"text":"The only time I've been let down was when I stopped by for lunch during the week (they open at 3 M-Th).  I've had the burger with bacon and onion strings twice (can't remember the name), once with beef, and once with smoked, ground pork (smoked on the premises).  Delicious both times, but I'll stick with medium/medium rare beef for my burgers from now on.    The flat bread pizzas are pretty good, had the Alligator Pear pizza off of the \"specials\" menu.  The Avocado Salad was good too, and they smoke vegetables as well.  Who knew smoked beats could be so good?  The beer selection is constantly changing and has a couple of somethings for everyone.  Go and try something new to you."}
{"text":"Very few places capture the essence of eating in the middle of Phoenix quite like this one. With 30 revolving micro brewed beers, a menu that is simply delish, you simply can not go wrong here. My wife and I started with the \"Hot Mess Fries\", it was served hot with gravy, wonderful. I got the \"Animal\" burger, blue cheese and onions along with a custom sauce, best burger I have had in a long time. My wife got the \"Trucker\" pizza, loaded with bacon. Combined with a couple of micro brewed beers, and we simply could not finish everything! Our server was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. Eating on the patio offered a wonderful view of Phoenix, and there was more than enough room. Don't delay in trying this place out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Love the restaurant, beer and staff. You will normally find us Thursday evenings to enjoy a good brew."}
{"text":"Went late night with friends and my chihuahua. Nice patio area. Outstanding beer selection. Very good food selection for late night. Attentive service."}
{"text":"Drinks were good.  Did not eat, but it looked ok."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best and unique food anywhere in AZ.  Everything I have had is just hands down amazing.  Their beer selection is always great, except sometimes they are a little heavy on the IPAs.  This brings me to one of the best parts of this place, the people watching.  The \"normal\" crowed for this place will put the word Hipster to shame.  Plaid, Plaid, and more Plaid with some great thick frame glasses and Toms or Sperrys and everyone will love you.  If that is not your style go there to have some great laughs.   The wait staff knows the beer and always has great recommendations and will take care of all your needs. Even if people watching is not your thing go there for the amazing food and wait staff!!!"}
{"text":"It's one of the most casual beer places with pretty decent food. Their wings are on point, and the flatbreads are usually my go to. Burgers won't disappoint you either. The only drawback is the long line on weekends but you can just grab a pint while you're queuing."}
{"text":"Everything that I've eaten at this joint is top notch. They have plenty of beers and wines on tap, constantly changing the drink menu daily. Just go! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My review is only on the food from just one visit and not on the abundant selection of over thirty craft brews they offer on tap. I also noticed a selection of wines on tap and a very nice large dog friendly patio.  I ordered what I think was called the avocado salad and it really was among one of the best salads I ever had anywhere. It was unique and interesting and something better than what I would have at home because I wouldn't take the time to smoke my own beets. The combination of creamy avocado, mild goat cheese and smoked beets with those tasty little just the right amount of toasted almonds was quite a sensation in my mouth. I will have to steal that one as it really was that good. The greens were very fresh and above average and the dark meat chicken option was tasty and cooked just right. I also enjoyed the supreme segments of grapefruit as they added so much brightness and freshness and really cut the richness in the salad. The salad had everything going on it was really good.  My husband had the matador sandwich, it was pink beef with onions, peppers, mushrooms, horseradish Havarti cheese and a pretzel roll with two dipping sauces and fries. I didn't taste it but I thought it looked good. My husband said it was good but would have liked the peppers cooked more and more of them.  I would like to try the beer sampling option next time.  I thought the meals were reasonably priced. If I remember correctly the total including tax was around $23.00."}
{"text":"Great food , even better beer! Very nice atmosphere with friendly service! They,have a great selection(31) of beers and 6 wines on tap!"}
{"text":"This place was descent in price and good environment. Try the grilled cheese is soooo good!"}
{"text":"Oh man they have an AMAZING selection of STRONG beers!  As a craft beer nerd from San Diego, the CAPITAL of craft beer south of Portland, I was impressed.  And their pork burger with fried egg was AMAZING!  I am glad i found this spot before leaving AZ.  If you like craft beer and fatty foods to go with it, this is the place.  If you like budlight and carrots....for the love of God, change your lifestyle. The 6 drink sampler is perfect for a taste, but i really wanted to try more, since their beer is of a great variety (not just a bunch of IPAs and Wheats and Belgians, but they seriously ran the gamut) .  Will return if I make my way back to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop for happy hour and glad we did! Although I'm not a beer drinker, wine for me, we thought the reviews looked good.  I had the Fun Guy flatbread and it was delicious and plentiful! Hubby had the grilled cheese and brisket sandwich. He eats for real and couldn't finish the whole thing.   He enjoyed a lager and I tried a couple of really good wines.  The service was exceptional and friendly."}
{"text":"Angel's Trumpet is one of my favorites. When living in Phoenix I would always come in for food, especially for TV dinner night.   I'm really glad that I got to come back as a beer snob after living in San Diego for a while. Because breweries are scarce in the Phoenix area, Angel's Trumpet is the perfect place to try local beers. There were even some from other states that I had wanted to try. We were able to try 2 flights and then ordered pints of the ones we loved. My favorite of this visit was the Bread Pudding beer from Huss. It was delicious.   We were more than satisfied with our visit and the servers were helpful during our beer selections. If you're in Phoenix and you love beer... Go to Angel's Trumpet!"}
{"text":"I was surprised how packed the place was for a Wednesday night; I snagged the only open seat at the end of the bar. The bartender was very friendly and greeted me right away. I needed a sec to look at the taplist. It was tough to read them all so I checked Taphunter. They had poured the last of a dunkel I wanted to order, but the bartender suggested a witbier substitute, and it was good.  They had some tasty-sounding specials, but I ordered the Brewlee burger with fries, and it was solid. The meat was cooked well, and the carmelized sugar on the burger added something unique. Fries were well-seasoned and crispy. The dipping sauce that came with it was odd. It tasted like a strange attempt at ketchup, like a salty and sweet bloody mary mix.  Maybe slightly more than brewpub prices: I paid $25 or so after tax and tip for a burger and one beer. The atmosphere here wasn't what I expected; it was definitely more happening and a lot of people were there to drink. I guess I anticipated something a bit more chill, but no matter. They clearly do a booming business."}
{"text":"We we're attending a Suns game and yelped a place to eat.  Family friendly, nice staff, well priced for the amount of food, and fun ambiance.  Good place to stop at before a game."}
{"text":"This place is incredible, i'm not one to often go out for burgers. But when I go to Angels Trumpet it is always the Brewlee Burger that comes with a fried egg. Be sure to get the fries that comes with their home made ketchup (you;d be surprised how likable this side sauce is). I think that's all you need to know... wait the Beer!   They always have new beers to try, order the flat which will give you six samples of the beers of your choice. Outside sitting area with space to play bags."}
{"text":"I love this place! Talk about great beers! There is something for everyone, the taps are always rotating and they're always well-poured and perfectly cold.  The food is also solid. We ordered the pretzels, which were SO GOOD. I probably could have eaten the whole plate but I like to keep my friends.  I also ordered the hot wings, which were crispy and delicious. Everyone was pleased with their food.  Angels get s busy on the weekends, so be prepared to wait. We went across the street to the Cobra Arcade Bar to have a beer and play a few games while we waited to be seated.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"2 1/2 stars for their flabreads. 4 stars for everything else.   They have a great selection of beers. They even have draft wines if you are into that. The atmosphere is also great. It has a bright, sunny, open feel in the daytime and becomes more intimate at nighttime, Either way, it feels like Im at someone's 1960's home but with a modern twist (seems weird to say but thats how I interpret it.)  I tried some of my friends avocado salad and thought it was pretty good for being basic, The flatbreads on the other hand could have been better. The bread that had toppings got soggy real quick. The cheese felt like food truck quality grade, nothing real stood out flavor wise except the grease from the meats and cheese, and the brussel sprouts were undercooked. I was still able to eat it but I dont have the fondest memories of eating it.  Even though the flatbreads arent that good, the beers and atmosphere win me over that much. Although hesistant to eat anything big from here, the beer should be the focus."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go if you are downtown for an event or any reason.  Not only do they have a great selection of BEER, the menu is fantastic.  There were too many choices to narrow down my meal.  Kudos to Ashley for great service and meal advice."}
{"text":"Here are my 2 biggest gripes about this place. It is loud. Like really loud, so loud you have to really come close to yelling to be heard.  Also the service is mediocre at best. I really don't think this is anyone elses fault but managements for running the place, what seems to be, threadbare  at best. The staff were hustling on a Friday night and even so they were clearly overwhelmed. Maybe on weeknights, this can be a quiet little place to go to but don't bother on the weekend. Every single time I have been here, it has been packed.   The beer selection is excellent, they do offer samples if you cannot decided what to get before you get a full pour. I wish they had more Belgian beers on tap but there's so much variety to pick and choose from that it is impossible to get everything up there anyway.   The food selection is good and I mostly stick to the appetizers or snacks when I'm here, I mean lets be honest I'm here for the beer and so far it has not disappointed. The waits were not too long for the food regardless of how busy they were , so kudos to the kitchen staff for hustling like no tomorrow.   Great place for large groups, the outdoor seating area has some games and is nice when the weather outside isn't oppressive. The patio is dog friendly so bring your puppers cuz they need some love too :)   Fun fact: Enjoy the mural outside by the empty plot of land before someone throws up apartments all over it. Angle's Trumpet Ale House and the Goldwater institute sued the city to prevent a taxbreak to Amstar/McKinley LLC over a proposed 6 million taxbreak to build micro apartments on that empty plot of land. Not sure how I feel politically about this, but hey, beer.. amirite ?"}
{"text":"Corn hole! Yes...not many down town places have games but they do..the food is excellent!  And the beer..always a treasure to seek out! Dessert? oh yeah..the pop-tart....yum!"}
{"text":"Went there Sunday for lunch. Very nice beer selection. Menu for lunch is very small.  Not sure why for a Sunday with games on TV, why isn't there some finger food? Simple platter with some chips,peanuts,olives,wings...??? Definite minus.   Waitress were very nice but seemed a bit confused and/or slow. The cook screwed up  the order which took even longer to rectify.  Why do you call everything with a funny name? Just call it a burrito since this is how the waitress is going to explain it to the customer anyway....  Last, it was about have way full and the noise level was high. Can't imagine how high it gets when they are full. Must look into putting some form of noise abatement."}
{"text":"I've been coming here sporadically for several years...I love the food, the beer is good (though despite a constant rotation of beer, they manage to not have a lot of diversity in type) but the service is pretty horrendous. Speaking as a long time server/bartender, the wait staff seems terribly disorganized. Good luck trying to get another beer, have a server check on you after you get your food, or close out your tab. Either they're terribly understaffed, or their employees do not understand table service techniques.   Will I return? Probably if friends want to, but I won't ever suggest it again."}
{"text":"Great food and 30 beers on tap. I had the BBQ brisket grilled cheese which was outstanding. The french fries are nicely seasoned and they make their own ketchup which was awesome. Top it all off with good service and reasonable prices and you have the recipe for a winner."}
{"text":"If you want craft beer this is absolutely the place. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but this place has an amazing menu. Their home made pop tarts are a must try. I love everything I've tried on the menu. I live out of town but every time we're in AZ we come back. 5 stars all around for sure."}
{"text":"This place was really good.  The peanut butter and chipotle raspberry jam sandwich was amazing!  You have to try it."}
{"text":"Honestly, we were trying to go to Phoenix Market cafe but they were closed for a private event. We found out about this place and it was the greatest blessing. This place was quite quaint and even though we got appetizers, it was so filling. So filling to the point that we weren't able to eat the dinner we had planned with other coworkers. Churro Raspberry pop tart was everything! The cauliflower pizza was delish. Who would have thought that the taquito sweet potato's would have tasted so amazing with those two sauces on the side. I should have taken pictures!!"}
{"text":"Angels has an impressive collection of beers on tap originating from local Arizona to California- lagers, ales, stouts, you name it, they've got it. If you're feeling overwhelmed by the choices (there are 31 after all, not even counting the wine), ask for a sampler platter! My boyfriend and I got lucky and got a free drink from Fat Bikes who was doing a promotion. If you're looking for a hip location just to hang out with friends and throw a couple back, this is the place for you. The only down sides are that 1. Bar space is very limited and the overall venue extremely packed- there's restaurant seating as well. 2. The bar tenders were efficient but were very low on energy and enthusiasm. It was mildly making me depressed just watching them."}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I am able to count on my fingers and toes... I think that about sums it up  OH... I am a HUGE chicken wing fan and the harshest critic of their preparation and flavor... This place is one of the top 3 places I will actually go specifically for the wings...   Kuddos to the chef!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great little spot! Great food and good service. Came in for the beer - stayed for the food. We sat out on the patio and enjoyed the ambiance. Have not been back, yet, but next chance we get will hit them up."}
{"text":"So, I have now been here twice and have had a great experience both times.    Also, both times I brought my seven year old son with me.   (Yes, I am one of those people who think it's totally appropriate to drink a beer in public in front of my child......)   So...plusses:   - huge selection of beer and the flight option is nice - you get to taste so many!  And who doesn't love it when beer comes in an adorable muffin tin? - Food was very tasty!   My son had the buffalo dog and said it was the best hot dog he had ever had.   I'm vegetarian and didn't have trouble finding anything on the menu.   -Fun atmosphere, great decor, large patio   Minus - The brunch menu today was limited.  My son REALLY wanted a buffalo dog today - in fact, he chose the location because of it - and he was very sad that it wasn't on the menu.     Extra plus:  - Excellent service!  They made my son a buffalo dog today at brunch, even though it wasn't supposed to be available today.  We will be returning on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Angels Trumpet Ale House on Kerry M.'s birthday. I love the look of this bar! Very open and modern looking, also very hipster-ish. They have an large outdoor patio and don't even get me started on how tasty their pretzels are! What I loved about this place is that they have ~40 beers on tap and when one is empty, they add something completely new and then update the 2 chalkboards. It leaves you wanting to know what's gonna be tapped next. Love it!"}
{"text":"Where should I start . Cool environment .cool staff . Had some wine . Cool . Ordered some tacos on the appetizer part . So cool. Have no idea what was in it . But delicious . Had some fries . The bomb . Ketchup home made sauce . Idk about that . Pop tarts for desert . Lord . I will be back . Period"}
{"text":"Great rotating beer selection !   Strong local showing, just don't see Santan today.  Only so many handles I suppose.  Check this place out."}
{"text":"We stopped by after a movie at the Film bar for a few drinks.  Sat on the patio with the misters going.  Good service and the wings were great."}
{"text":"Second time in and I'm still going back.  The atmosphere is beer centric with great food compliments to set off a solid meal. There's a back patio with cornhole and plenty of seating so you can enjoy killer Phoenician weather this time of year. The selection of beers will keep you going for quite some time, my friend had a flight and although there wasn't much guidance of the random beers we knew nothing about its will fun to try and learn and ask questions from their lively bar crew.  It's places like these that are really helping develop the Phoenix food and drink scene."}
{"text":"The burgers here are to die for.  I love the way they are constantly adding new beer taps to their menu.  The atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I really really like it.  31 draft craft beers... all written out on some sort of chalk board... you are bound to find one that your little heart desires.  I really enjoy oatmeal stouts so my waitress was able to recommend one that I fell in love with.  They are ever-changing.  A little on the pricier end but worth it.  The decor is great... & I love the patio.    Their flights are served on muffin pans.  I thought that was super clever.  Food looks great... I stole some sort of meaty concoction of a pizza slice for the people I was with & it was cheesy perfection.  Can't wait to try the other stuff on the menu as well."}
{"text":"Large selection of beer and very laid back ambience. Perfect for a relaxing saturday night with good friends. Would give it 5 stars if I didn't have to setup my own corn hole boards. How hard is it for them to already have it setup so I don't have to do the hard work?"}
{"text":"Great patio, great selection, but the service needs to be better."}
{"text":"Met a buddy of mine here before a concert down the road - was spectacular!  Great craft beer selection with plenty of IPAs on tap.  Server was very knowledgeable about brewers, locations, etc.  The burger I had could have been the best burger ever!  Also, loved the slaw it came with.  Definitely a place I would visit again!  Could be the best kept secret in all of Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food here was really good! I'm not a beer drinker (not by choice...unfortunate allergy to brewer's yeast) but I enjoyed watching my bf enjoy his flight, which was reasonably priced. The fish tacos were amazing! My bf ordered a burger and the fries had a delicious homemade ketchup-like sauce. He rated the burger as \"really good\", which strayed from they typical \"it was okay\" that I usually get. Great service. Not too crowded for Sunday lunch. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. We went for the Tuesday TV dinner. It was yummy, filing, and you can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in our meals recently: server recommended green chili burrito, the famous fish tacos, and cheese flatbread.  We'll stick to sandwiches and salads."}
{"text":"First of all, I drove past it because the place is so nondescript.  I thought I had the wrong address for a minute.  It stands right next to an empty-open-dirt lot right across from the Film Bar. Once I got in, I immediately like the open-flow of the place because it carries from inside to outside effortlessly. The layout is quite laid back and they even have lounge chairs outside for some real relaxation. I also thought that the blackboard listing all their drinks had a nice eccentric effect to it.    We went on a Friday late afternoon and the place was semi-full but completely full two hours later.  I enjoyed the Farm flat bread pizza topped with delicious veggies.  I loved every bite even though I'm not a vegetarian.  My two friends each enjoyed the Flight which is a muffin tray that holds six small glasses of different beers of your choice.  I was too hungry so I didn't go for that.  But if you go there on a full stomach, it's a great choice if you want to try almost all the drinks."}
{"text":"Great treat after a 25 mile bike ride, our group of 75+ ascended upon Angels Trumpet and they did an awesome job with the food and booze, wings are great along with the beer selection. Outside patio is wonderful"}
{"text":"With open and loud seating, this beer bar offers a great selection of tasty brews from all over the world all micro in nature. The big flavors of lagers, IPAs and porters, among many others, are available to customers as pints or in flights for tasting. Though the menu could be a little more creative, it leaves you with several yummy choices to accompany your beer.   If you're a beer lover and like loud, hip places, this is one you should definitely check out!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had. We were a group of 6 all varying in ages & everyone loved their meal. Great staff & nice environment. They even have a space out one the patio for dogs :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I were extremely impressed with the food we had last night. We shared the Big Guppy fish tacos, the Brewlee burger, and for dessert we took an order of salted caramel chocolate chip cookies to go. Everything was delicious. Our server was very friendly and took the time to give us info on the food and some of their beers. They said our wait would be 45 minutes but it ended up only being 20. It was definitely worth the wait.   For two entrees(which had plenty of food), 2 beers, and dessert our check was $39.00.   The only negatives... it is very loud inside, not a big waiting area, which could be an issue if it is cold or hot outside, and not a very big place, which means you're more than likely going to wait during peak hours.   We will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"Never fails! There is always an amazing selection of craft beers and pub/semi-gastro eats. Have a burger, pick a beer (or try a flight) and must of all: ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. I'm usually one to not care about service if the food is good, but this place is just too rude. Even tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. We had at least 4 people help serve us and 3 out of 4, were just completely rude."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go in downtown Phoenix!!!  I take everyone who visits here!  Highly recommended!  Service is amazing!  The owners are awesome, and so friendly!    Try the spam sliders you won't regret it!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place can get a little boring, but you know- if I'm in the mood to sit in a lit up beer house and eat man food- all delicious, but everything heavy and meaty. I suppose this place will do.   The beers are great. It's much better to do beer flights though, as the slection is so broad, you always feel like you are missing out... at least I do.  Vegetarian food options suck. Pizza is okay. The burger looks fantastic, if only I ate burgers. I always end up getting a pretzel, I like the beer cheese sauce stuff.   I wish they had some lighter small plate options. The pretzel seems to be the lightest warm option they have."}
{"text":"I'm sure the food is good, unfortunately the chicken I ordered was as is dry as the dessert and the waitress had a ops mentality. That's to bad"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and has an awesome patio!  Dog friendly for all the animal lovers. Good food and friendly service. Definitely going to become a regular."}
{"text":"My roomie chose Angels as her jumping off point on her birthday weekend. They have a pretty awesome beer selection! I had a couple Belgian beers, which were both very good. Too bad I can't remember their names... Blame the cocktails I had at subsequent bar stops. ;)  I digress.... They write the beer selection on a GIANT chalkboard behind the bar and it is ever-changing as the beers run out and new ones are tapped. Most of our group ordered food and everything looked really tasty.  I tried a friend's sweet potato tacos; sounds unique and they are! Deep fried tacos full of sweet potato and mild spices; tasty!  Bf ordered a meat flatbread... This thing was larger than expected and a great deal for $10. He picked the meat off a piece for me to try and it was quite yummy. The sauce is a roasted tomato and gave the flatbread a great layer of flavor.  They also have a great big back patio... It was a little too warm for our group to sit out there, but over the next month I imagine it will be a really great place to chill with friends and enjoy some brew.  =)  Hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"Great crowd, excellent beer selection, Tuesday night is TV dinner night, was a nice meal and had all the major food families! Will definitely come back here in the future! Sat at the bar, nice people behind the bar, guys next to me from Minneapolis and Portland OR, both beer aficionados, learned a few new things about the beer I'm drinking."}
{"text":"If you're a beer lover, you'll probably love Angels Trumpet Ale House, which has more than 30 beers on tap in downtown Phoenix. The spot also serves up lunch and dinner, with a menu full of sammies, pizzas and hamburgers to be enjoyed in the large communal dining room, at the beer bar or out on the patio.  I love that the bar and eatery is right across the street from FilmBar, which makes it an ideal place to grab a bite and drink before a show. When I last went there, I got a Churchill Grilled Cheese Sammy ($8.50), which I got with fries. It wasn't my favorite grilled cheese (I would leave off the pesto next time), but the portion was so huge I could barely finish half my meal. It was a great value.  My companion got the Tractor pizza ($11), which was one of the most unique pizzas I've ever seen -- it came with Brussel sprouts, bacon, caramelized onion, and even an egg on top.  As for beers, there are giant chalkboards describing each one, and the servers are really knowledgeable and can help guide you toward a good choice."}
{"text":"Tonight was my third or fourth time dining at Angels Trumpet and I still have zero complaints. The beer flight and the grilled cheese sandwich with bacon jam are definite must haves. The service is great, the servers and front of house staff seem to really jive well and anticipate guests needs. I highly recommend Angels Trumpet!"}
{"text":"Walk into Angels Trumpet House and it feels like you've left Phoenix and entered a city like SF's establishment. At least that's what I think. The vibe here is very cool, urban, indie, and just simply brewtastic. It's brewtastic because they serve just about every cool beer you can think of.   It's a very open environment with long tables and a spacious patio. Music plays over the loud pseaker, beer flavors line the walls and a large bar top welcomes guests to take a seat. Between the atmosphere and beer selection, if you like beer this is your place. It's also right across the street from Filmbar so a great stop before or after your indie film!"}
{"text":"Exceptionally fast service from start to finish, and the food was good (had spam sliders). Would love to see them up their game on the beer list - lots of tools out there to allow for more details regarding what is on tap."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was fun. Asu game was on. Amazing beer selections. The food-... had the fish tacos 'the big guppy'. They tasted like nothing, with a side of vinegar cabbage slaw and avocado mash that had waaay to much cumin, and sort of made it inedible. :/ the ratio of fish to tortilla was good if we're speaking dollar value but not to enjoy without taking a piece out. Their 'housemade' ketchup is super fresh and amazing for spaghetti- not fries. Thank god my friend ordered the 'fun-guy' pizza flatbread..it saved the meal! All and all more of a beer drinking spot with over priced-hipster bar food."}
{"text":"Best pork rinds ever!! Love the cool local vibe. Great food, took me to a happy place!!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for some dinner with friends. Let's me start off by saying I didn't drink here so I can't comment on their beers, which I know is huge. I did have their grilled cheese and it was good but not great. The cheese was like it had been melted but then sat out for a bit so by the time I got it it somewhat rehardened. My friend was extremely impressed by the wings, so maybe I just didn't get the right thing. I will definitely give this place another try to experience their beers and try something else off the menu. Dog friendly patio is a huge plus too. All in all not blown away but not discouraged from going back."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to grab a brew.   Pretty neat place. Nice patio which I hear is dog friendly And lots of brews to choose from which is always a big plus in my book.   We grabbed a few pitchers of beer here; one pitcher equals 2 glasses and at 6 bucks a pitcher it was a good deal.  I saw that they had SPAM sliders, and I do love spam, so I badgered my other half into ordering them.  I really enjoyed my Spam sliders, they were cooked crispy and came to the table nice and warm.  They went perfectly with my pitcher of Mother Roads black IPA.  Our service was a little on the slow side, unless you are sitting at the bar.  It has always been moderately busy when we were here, but not too busy that it is too loud (I hear that is a major complaint).  Since I don't like overly loud places where conversing is a problem, I think I will continue to come here during off peak times."}
{"text":"Awesome flatbread pizza and an even better selection of beer.  Word of advice, don't try the wild ale. The color is deceiving."}
{"text":"Went here while visiting friends who suggested coming here. We had a party of 5 and arrived on a Saturday around 6pm. There was a wait, but it was not too long, probably 15-20 minutes. We sat outside after a table was ready.  I decided to go with the beer sampler special, which is any 6 beers on tap, I think it was around $11. I tried a range of different beers, from an IPA to a brown ale to a saison. I really liked the selection -- it was hard for me to decide because there were so many delicious-sounding beers to choose from! I would order 4/6 of them again, and the other 2 were just not my taste. For dinner, I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with avocado (I forget the name of it). Fries came on the side. The bread and overall taste of the sandwich was good, but unfortunately the pork was dry. My boyfriend had brisket in his sandwich, and he said his meat was also dry. At one point a piece of pork fell out of the sandwich, and I thought I was picking up a fry, but it was actually a long strand of dry meat! The fries were very good though - perfectly crispy. Our service was great...our server checked up on us the perfect amount and was quick bringing everything out.  I also really liked the vibe here. There were all kinds of people dining the night we went. Older people, young people with beautiful tattoos, a group of people wearing onesies and halloween costumes, couples, singles, etc. It was a great night for people-watching. The place was pretty packed but I never felt like it was too loud.   I would definitely come here again, and either order a different sandwich, or hope the dry meat was a fluke. I loved the vibe and the beer selection. Overall, a great place in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection! Food is top-notch; friendly knowledgeable staff. Definitely a do-again! We came for lunch; I had the Matador and my husband had the 810.  Highly recommend, even if you have to drive a bit to get here (we drove from Chandler)."}
{"text":"sometimes i wished we lived in dowtown phx. there are just blocks and blocks and blocks of cool eateries and bars and people. such was last night on our night out to visit some friends for drinks at Angels trumpet.   the interior space is beautiful...a mix of exposed construction with clean wall tiles and accessories. there as an enormous patio but don't know if they allow dogs. parking tonight was tricky because it was also first friday and we were told not to park in the dirt lot behind the bar or we'd get a ticket, so we found a close street spot.   our service was excellently friendly and prompt and kept the water glasses filled. but of course the draw here is beer. OMG the beer! and great beer.....a wall of taps of the nectar of the gods. the pints are reasonably priced and you can do a flight of 6 of any of their beers, even the expensive ones! from 9% to 3% alcohol content, heavy stouts to light lagers and everything in between, you are bound to find an option of beer that suits you here...only problem is, you may get wasted in your efforts to find your favorite!  the food was pretty good...a small selection since the focus is beer but my fish tacos were excellent and my wife raved about her arugula salad.   what a great find!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the beer.  3 stars for the food.   One of the best beers I've had in the valley. Food on the other hand is just okay in my opinion. Won't be begging to go back for dinner but would like to come by for a happy hour to get some good brews."}
{"text":"Fantastic Spot..in town for a conference and tried the Angel. The atmosphere was very garage, gastro with great beer selection and a simple yet delicious menu. I would recommend to anyone. As a bonus there is a indie film house across the street which is beside a vintage arcade bar..score!!"}
{"text":"Quiet on the outside, but full of energy on the inside. Seems to be a great place for friends or couples. Music seemed too long for dates, but you can get away from that on the patio if you want. The honeycomb/chicken wire plays well to the classy-hipster theme.  Well staffed. Our server was attentive when he needed to be, and not overly but didn't miss filling waters, beer, food, either. Nice work on that hire!  Beer: Beer selection is great, and staff knows what to recommend based on what you're in the mood to drink. Or, get a flight, and you'll get a range. The flights are served in a muffin tin so you can easily carry and go play bags in the patio, or sit until your table is ready. I saw wine, but my group stuck with beer.   Good ole fashioned:  great, medium cook for me and was cooked correctly. Fries come with natural tomato ketchup sauce (awesome!!). The Cole slaw is a healthy portion as well.  Farm flat bread:  recommended by the server and he was right, it was delicious and a more veggie friendly option.  Riblets: Healthy serving, great bbq sauce. (Bones included in the but size pieces.) I couldn't find on the menu so not sure the menu name of what my friend ordered.  Chipotle hummus:  healthy serving, big pieces and easy to share. Quantity and quality trumps the presentation.  Hot pretzel: Cooked perfectly, soft middle with crispy outside. Cheese sauce is delicious. Literally everyone orders these so look around if you're hesitant. I think 4 on a platter. We are them too fast before I could take a photo.  Pop tart: I heard and read about this, but we were to full and I'll have to come back to try."}
{"text":"Angels Trumpet has just about the best beer selection downtown, and they stock their taps with very many of the finest local brews. They also have an option to fill growlers to take home which is fantastic. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food, but I'm giving one star for the bad customer service. Had the same exact experience that Robert F. had. Ordered the peach beer and it was horrible - sent it back and waiter said he would ask manager to take it off - and the manager said no. Seriously? It was not drinkable - and probably cost them nothing - now they lost me and any future income from me and my work friends (I just vetoed a big work party to go there). I actually went on the same day as the other reviewer - so maybe it was just the beer was bad - sad that we had to pay for it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to grab some good food and beers with great casual atmosphere you've found it. Walk in grab a menu and seat yourself in their large indoor or outdoor seating area. Pick your beers or draft wine from a large blackboard that rotates new beverages in often. The food is down to earth and full of flavor, with employees knowing their favorites and making personal recommendations rather than a blanket statement of what's good or not. Service is quick and attentive without being bothersome nor sloppy. The sandwiches are something unique yet familiar - and excited to try the rest of the menu and rotating specials menu. Great spot for a date or get together with friends, kids would be fine but doesn't seemed to be geared toward them"}
{"text":"Awesome service- Jake was very personable and knowledgeable. Terrific beer selection. Dynamite Brewlee burger and fries! I highly recommend this cool joint."}
{"text":"This place continues to wow with an awesome rotating tap selection, unique craft beers and bustling atmosphere.  I cannot get over waiting at your table for greater than 15 minutes for service, so usually have to saunter up the bar, order a beer, pay and peramble back to the table before the server even acknowledges our existence.  I wouldn't usually complain about this, but it has happened on more than one occasion.   Will always come here for the great beer selection, and you should too.  Best in downtown Phoenix, bar none."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of the Tuesday night TV dinners. $7 gets you a generous portion of a creatively presented, inspired meal. I've experienced the Salisbury steak and the carne asada tacos and found both to be exceptionally enjoyable!   I truly think the whole place is clever! I really like what they're doing and I plan to keep returning."}
{"text":"Fun spot and especially good for the beer lovers!  Lots of options from smaller breweries and local Arizona breweries!  Fun for an evening with friends and great for groups!!"}
{"text":"This place kicks ass. Found it almost by mistake but now it's on my \"must return\" list. Over 30 brews to choose from and a menu of great eclectic items. I had a flat bread pizza and my colleague had a turkey sandwich. Fantastic outdoor patio option with an interior decor that is funky, functional, and just the right amount of urban industrial. I would strongly recommend this spot. Knocked it off the wall...."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to places when we have friends or family in town. The food, beer, ambiance, and service are always excellent!"}
{"text":"The pros., clean restaurant with it's own parking lot which is rare for downtown.  Also, the pricing seems reasonable and the food isn't bad.   The cons., this place is just like every other hipster ale house in town, so it's unforgettable.  It also smelled like spilled beer as soon as you walk in.  Once we seated ourselves, I ordered one of their claims to fame; the homemade pop-tart.  It tasted pretty good, for not tasting anything like a pop-tart and as long as you don't look at the grey mush inside.  Bottom line, don't expect anything special from this place.  The food is fine and the atmosphere is fine.  If you're in the area, not the worst choice, but not the best."}
{"text":"It's a nice place, some of the wait staff had some strong body odor. The food was yummy and the beers were cold and tasty."}
{"text":"My newfound hang-out!! Went here yesterday with my friend who is a beer connoisseur. The bartenders, Tommy and Thomas, were such awesome, friendly, helpful and accommodating guys. They made us feel totally welcome and we had a great time.   We ordered a flight in addition to a few more beers. Zero complaints. I recommend the saison from Funkwerks Brewery. The Holiday Cider and Decadence Stout were other favorites, but like I said, all of it was excellent. Fantastic beer selection---best in the Valley that I've seen.   The food is also noteworthy: the alligator pear flatbread = out of this world. We also ordered the salad with spinach and grapefruit (can't remember the name) that was equally amazing. What a great experience!! I can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"Great food,  with delicious house made sauces. And.  . . A huge selection of great craft beers also draft wine!"}
{"text":"Really like this place, they have a great selection of you guessed it, ales, I suggest getting the six beer tasting thingy (I forget what it's called), that way you can get a sample of many and find out what you really like. Corey is awesome, great service, people and food too. Only been there a couple times so once I get acclimated I might raise it to 5 stars."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get beer downtown. The food is fantastic, great sized portions, and great for hungry American eats. The atmosphere is fun and the outdoor area is really wonderful as well. Not a place to go if you want a mixed drink, but then again, why go to a beer house?"}
{"text":"This place is loud. Sit outside if you prefer not to yell at your companions. But omg, what a great and ever changing selection of beers on tap! The staff are pros. The kitchen is pretty fast, even when there's a large crowd. And the food is excellent. The 810 is probably the best turkey, ahem, *smoked* turkey sandwich I've ever had. Flat bread pizzas are excellent. You can't really go wrong here. Don't think too hard about it. Order what sounds good the day that you're there and prepare to enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"I was at the film bar across the street and ran into this ale house.  What a great find, I was visiting from Tampa and I am happy I gave it a try.  This ale house had a TON of different beers and even some wine.  Service was top notch and so was the beer.  I had a porter and my wife had a peach cider.   Both beers had great taste to them and had perfect pours.  We were actually late to the airport cause we wanted to stay.  We also ordered a pizza to hold us through our flight.  What a great idea, pizza was the Casper and it was amazing.  It had goat cheese, honey drizzle, salami, leeks, rosemary, garlic.  Salami was cooked to perfection and so was the pizza.  Atmosphere was great, a lot of people having a good time.  Outside area is nice and spacious.  They even have some corn hole sets that you can play with.  Gave it 4 stars cause after we decided to eat and sat at a table.  It took them a while to notice that we needed some service.  Parking is pretty small so bring some quarters to pay for parking."}
{"text":"I have been to Angel's Trumpet a number of times, and while the building looks great and they have a wide beer selection, the service is slow and waiters don't know anything about the menu. If you're going to have a wide range of beers, your staff need to be able to speak about them, let alone pronounce the names (they always had to search around for the number.) The food is bland and very expensive for what it is.   Not to mention the owner is actively undermining the local arts and creative scene. He works to railroad the Roosevelt BID, complaining that he'd have to pay more taxes while all the \"parasitic\" artists in the area get things for free (his words...). He moved into this neighborhood and has cashed in on downtown's renaissance (driven by the very people he undermined by tanking the BID.) Shameful behavior from someone who must not value their neighbors or the unique neighborhood. Anyone who cuddles up with Ducey isn't someone who gets my money."}
{"text":"Love the location and spot.  The patio area will be a huge draw now that the weather is finally good.  The food is meh.  The beer selection is great with a large chalkboard you can order from.  The main room is noisy (which a good ale house should be really) but I was really hoping the food would be tastier.  It's an eclectic menu, pizzas and spam sliders.  Things seemed to have been put on their randomly which is fine if puzzling.  The spam sliders are tasty and worth the fat and sodium bomb that they are.  The pizzas are a bit lacking but the salads are well done.  All in all, great place to see friends, just don't come super hungry :)"}
{"text":"My first experience here was less than stellar but my love for beer is so deep that I'd sell my grandma to a sex trafficking ring for a growler of high gravity beer.  Denying myself some beer from the nitro taps at Angels has been agony so I came back in against my best judgement.  I sat at the bar for a while before the bartender acknowledged me, no biggie, I was narrowing down my selection anyway.  I started to become annoyed though when he kept pouring tasters to the people next to me without even acknowledging me.  Finally, I get my taste of the beer I want to try and it's this little tiny pour that couldn't fill a thimble much less my mouth.  I thought to myself \"is this really happening, why is this guy being such a d!ck to me.\"  I looked over at my neighbors taste glasses and he was pouring them half way. I tell myself to let it go, it's only a taste, just get your beer and move on.  But I couldn't get my beer, no. I had to sit there and listen to the customer next to me tell the bartender about all the beers in Germany she has tried. When that long winded b!tch took a breath I stole my chance to order a beer. He looked at me very annoyed and nodded his head and continued his conversation.  Then he continues to pour more tasters for the people he is having a conversation with.  Did you get that?  A paying customer tried to order a beer and instead he poured his friends more freebies.  I walked out.  When I was leaving I saw a gentleman that looked like he was important, I asked him if he was in charge and he said he was. I informed him his bartender was a d!ck to me and he apologized for him.    Thank you for that apology, good sir.  You have a really great establishment and I want your product but their are barriers keeping me from getting it. Please get rid of your staff, hire people who know about customer service and let me tweak the decor to make it more comfortable.  Do that and you'll have a loyal customer for life."}
{"text":"Don't let the blase exterior (with the exception of the amazing mural) fool you at this joint... it's MUCH bigger than it looks from the outside.  The only food I tried was their margherita pizza, which was fresh and tasty - but far from my favorite.  I will reserve judgment on the rest of the menu items until I try, but their beer selection is just impeccable.  Rotating taps with every kind imaginable, a great happy hour, and friendly service = must try if you love beer.  I really loved the open design, the back patio (especially between October and May) are perfect for this part of Phoenix.  It's like, for a moment, you forget where you are.  Very zen like, and peaceful place to enjoy a drink - at least until they get busy, and then it's still great, just not as quiet.  MUST TRY if you're needing a drink downtown, I will surely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on a Sunday evening looking for a decent meal and a good drink selection and we were not disappointed.    -Excellent service = The server was genuinely interested in helping me find a drink I would enjoy -Great atmosphere = Laid back but not too casual like a dive bar -Delicious food = Recommend their pizzas and/or fish tacos"}
{"text":"Great beer, love the happy hour menus and specials!"}
{"text":"The draft wine & beers are really good and there is a huge amount of beer to choose from. We started with the flight and then each had our own favorite choice. Chenin Blanc also really good and just the perfect cool temperature (I can admit I'm a wine snob when it's not chilled properly and in 108 degrees outside a cool glass of wine is so delish!). We had the big guppy fish tacos, tractor flatbread, and a special of the day cauliflower flat bread and everything was great. Portions are large. Not enough room to try a pop tart because they give you a nice size beer too. Happy hour! I will always come back when I'm in town, love the laid back crowd here, it's got a hip vibe and the wait staff are so nice and friendly. Actually I just changed my 4 stars to 5 because I couldn't think of anything I didn't like about this place."}
{"text":"Love the craft beers and delicious food.  Great week night place to unwind and enjoy good time with friends"}
{"text":"Worst customer service EVER! They don't care about takin care of their customers. First and last time I will ever come to this place."}
{"text":"I think Angels Trumpet Ale House (besides having an awesome name) is a really neat place to hang out with friends, sample interesting beers, and take a breather after a busy week. Service can be a tad slow because of how busy it can get, but the servers are friendly and really helpful. The ambiance inside is a cross between casual hipster bar and comfortable after-work hangout bar. I like the wooden tables and stools, not to mention the outside seating in the backyard when the weather is nice.  Angels Trumpet's claim to fame -- and rightly so -- is their beer flights. The system is to grab a piece of paper with six circles drawn on them, write down the beers you'd like to sample using the numbering system updated on a blackboard, and prepare to be excited. The beer selection is unique and ranges from deep and smooth to tangy and fruity. I tend to lean towards lighter, fruitier beers, and out of the ones I've tried, the blood orange cider is hands down my favorite. I'm not a frequent drinker, but taste comes first in my book, and the blood orange cider was a great balance of acidic, fruity, and refreshing.   While the drink portion of the menu is impressive, I found the food portion rather lackluster, which was disappointing because I find drinks are always better when paired with good finger food.   Hot pretzels: These pretzels were advertised as using beer batter, if I remember correctly, and I was excited for the soft, airy pillows to pair with my beer flight. Unfortunately the pretzels themselves were rather dense and hard on the outside, and they were virtually inedible once they had cooled down a little. The cheese sauce was pretty good, the mustard was unremarkable, and overall I didn't think this was worth the ~$10 asking price.   Hummus platter: This platter was pretty generous in size, and the hummus was pretty flavorful taste-wise. It wasn't as smooth as I would've liked, with some chunks of garbanzo that hadn't been blended in. I liked the cucumber pairing, but the pita bread was dry and floury without much of that freshly-made fragrance I was looking for.   Poutine: The size of this dish was again generous, and we couldn't finish it even between three people, but the positives stopped there. The fries were limp and soggy, even the ones that hadn't been covered with gravy. The gravy was definitely not freshly made, and when paired with the fries, there was an overall flavor of \"having sat around for too long\" (if anyone knows the proper vocabulary word for that, please tell me!). I wouldn't recommend ordering this on the off chance that it is freshly made that day.  I'd certainly come back for hanging out and sampling some unique beers, but not for the food."}
{"text":"Huge selection of local and international beers on tap. I like the changing of the beer menu throughout the night! Awesome college type crowd with plenty groups of women! We didn't try any food, next time. Place can get pretty packed. We got there around 10 pm and was standing room only. A spot definitely worth coming back to."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great selection of beers. Delicious appetizers. Good music , service and crowd. Reasonable prices. Went here for happy hour last week. Had sliders and some beers  which were YUMMY (and I'm not even a fan of sliders at all) Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"ATAH! Just like their menu says. It says you are responsible for drinks that you ordered. But what if the waitress brings you the wrong drink? Which happened in our case. Yet we were held responsible. We tried to hold a dialogue, and were threatened no matter our yelp review it wouldn't matter, and the owner wouldn't care, because of what it said on the menu. I get it. Saw the menu. We are responsible for drinks that we ORDERED. But again, the waitress brought us the wrong drinks. That is why the one star. We should not be responsible for the wrong order. Period. So that is exactly what we tipped, what it says on the menu. Atah! Never be back. You may not care now, but you will when everyone catches on."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have eaten here about 4-5 times in the last few months. Every single time the food is great. And, very affordable.   The only downside is that the food does take a while to come out, which sucks if you're hungry when you show up. On the other hand, I guess it's worth it for good food.   The atmosphere is loud, boisterous and fun. It seems to always be extremely crowded. But I've never seen anything outrageously awful happen so it's a pretty good place to be.   I am sure we will eat here many more times this year!"}
{"text":"I have to give the 5 plus stars for the utterly amazing selection of craft brews on tap. I stared at the chalk board menu completely dumbfounded and paralyzed by indecision and it took me a few minutes to settle on the Full Sail Amber which was delicious (though you can'r really go wrong with Full Sail, can you?)  The minimal-artsy decor makes it right at home in the downtown arts district and the bar and layout make for a loud, lively atmosphere. I don't think I'll be coming here for meetings because the place is very loud and the beer is just too damned distracting.  It reminds me of the lovechild of Postino and Lux, with Bliss and Lost Leaf as the step-parents. The crowd seems to be a mix of the downtown artsy folks, some of the ASU crowd and the post-work working crowd such as yours truly.  They have a LOVELY patio with beautiful grass and meticulously groomed plants that I would have LOVED to trample on and destroy when I was a kid. This is PERFECT now that the weather is hopefully cooling down....at least at night.  It is a shame that smoking is not allowed on the patio, it is sizeable enough and it makes me sad that I cannot enjoy my beer while indulging my filthy habit. Other than that, the staff are friendly and enthusiastic and the wings look amazing so I think this is going to be a great addition to downtown."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch after visiting the Phoenix Open Air market and it was delicious!!! I had the fish tacos and oh my goodness the coleslaw was so good and the fish was so crispy! They came with an amazing pico and gauc - give them a try!!! My friends both had grilled cheese with fries and they devoured them. Of course they have 31 different beers on tap as well as a few wines on tap, you'll find something you love!!! Eat here and drink here you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went to this place for dinner last night with my boyfriend and had a great experience. We sat at the bar in hopes to get the lunch tray meals that they have every Tuesday. Unfortunately we were too late and missed out. However, this was not a downside because the menu was fantastic. My boyfriend and I almost wanted to order two entrees because we could not decide on what to get. The bartenders were super nice and attentive. The vibe is great and seems like all ages could be there. We will definitely go back and try to make it earlier for the lunch tray meals."}
{"text":"Get the pop tart! Every single one has been mouth watering. The beer selection is great and the ambience is nice. I'm not a huge fan of tap wines but you take what you can get."}
{"text":"They have thirty beers on tap and it's always an interesting selection of top quality choices from around the world.  This last time I had a Tool Snowball Saison from Denmark.  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  On a nice day the patio is a great place to hangout."}
{"text":"I've been to Angels Trumpet House a couple of times and I'm a big fan.  I am already a brewery junkie so this review could be biased.  Angels Trumpet is located in the heart of downtown Phoenix and it's a great alternative eating and drinking option for the area.    I love the ambiance and decor.  It's very hipster, natural in a really good way.  The outdoor patio is amazing and just laid back wooden tables which are perfect for enjoying a delicious brew.  The beer selection is extensive.  They have 20+ unique offerings on tap at any given time.  They are unusual but high quality beers that you won't see at your typical brewery or bar.  I'm an avid craft beer drinker and all of the beer choices are always new to me.  They are written on a chalk board which makes it a little difficult to see from your table.  I suppose that's my biggest complaint.  Having something at your table would help better chose your beer of choice.  The beer is also a little more pricey than other places.  Probably about $1 more than your typical brewery but the alcohol content is higher, so I like to think it evens out.  Now let's talk about the food...  YUM!  there are definitely hits and misses on the menu so just listen and plan accordingly -  Grilled Cheese - if you're a fan, don't think, just get it!!  It's so good and one of the best in the city.  Get it with the bacon jam and you won't be sorry.  A delicious blend of tomato, pesto, cheese and bacon jam on crusty bread.   Flatbread - good choice and good for sharing!  If they have a daily special one, go for that.    Fish Tacos - was a daily special one night and really good!  One of my favorites in town so far  Service is great too!  Everyone is friendly and very helpful with the beer selection!    Tip - visit during Happy Hour time if your life allows it - much better deals on the beer"}
{"text":"This establishment has been providing sub par service with a side of reheated food for years, but it has been a well rounded watering hole for those who want to try a number of craft beers in the neighborhood. Recently ownership has been vocal to the community that this is the only successful restaurant in the area. This is not only offensive to the patrons of the area but is a flat out lie. If you have a hankering for good food or drinks, try some of the long lasting and consistently good establishments.

{"text":"Love the selection of beer a flight was the best way to go, it was fun trying several different varieties!  Good food and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Nice location, would really like to see more places like this downtown.  We liked this place overall. We went on a Saturday night, and it was busy but we didn't have to wait for a patio table. Service was good, always nearby when we needed something. Had the wings to start, but were a bit dry and over cooked. Comes with 3 different sauces, but small bowls and can't dip.  I'd skip them... Had the Chet for dinner, lots of ingredients, focused on beans and chorizo.  Wasn't a huge fan, it was spicy and no contrast, beans and French fries.   The beer is where its at though. They have about 30 taps, all craft brew many of which rare to see. They had \"Enjoy By\" - Stone Brewery, handful of Dogfish, Firestone etc...  Easy to pick your flight, just write the numbers on the sheet.  Overall enjoyed this new place, just going to try some different food options."}
{"text":"Came here after a recommendation from a server at a restaurant close by.    Ordered a few beers, and while I wasn't too sure which one's I had, they tasted great.  And they packed a serious punch.  Great recommendation by the guy behind the counter.  So at least on the beer side of things, they seem to have a good selection.  Do a little bit of asking, and I am sure there will be a beer just right for you.  Got the feeling it was a total hipster bar, which isn't really my style, but that didn't mean it was a bad place.  There is lots of tables and plenty of space in the bar area. Beers were inexpensive for a tall glass.  A short walk from downtown if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Loved it twice!  Place is seat yourself. First time I had the Matador Sammy which was great. I was worried about the horseradish but it wasn't overwhelming at all.  Second time we came with a larger party (9 people) and they were still able to accommodate us by combining tables outside.  This time I had the Big Guppy fish tacos. Each taco came with two good sized pieces of fish. I loved this entree even more than the Matador!  Also love that they have a wide selection of beers and change it up all the time."}
{"text":"I went to Angle's Trumpet (love the name) with the sweetheart. When entering we waited for the hostess to seat us I asked what's the deal with having to wait to be seated at an Ale House? We were told it was a restaurant but we could have a seat at the bar without waiting if we saw available seating. We were cool with that. We chose to sit at the small lounge area. It was cozy. There is an outside patio area. Love the 31 flavors of beer concept. We were told all the beers were micro brewed beers. Sweet! We were informed we could have a six beer sampler tray for $9.00 plus tax. I passed on that. Our server Brandi was very nice and informative. She recommended a Pale ale beer for me and a pumpkin cider beer for my sweets. I had a couple of beers, when I received the second beer I was informed the keg had ran out of beer leaving my glass three quarters of the way full. I was discounted two dollars for that beer because of this, that was nice. I thought the beers were a little warm. I like cold beer. I really liked this place and plan on returning soon."}
{"text":"This place is 3 stars and no more. Reason why..I've been here 3 times now and I will say the environment and people who are customers seem cool but the staff needs a complete overhaul.   It just doesn't click. This place could very much be a great place but the waiters just don't rub me the right way and haven't since the first time I have visited here. At times they aren't attentive and at times aren't kind.   Try this place, and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Went here with a large group (planned event - 200+ people). Food was mediocre, no food specials for a large group, beers were pricey, slow service, long lines for bathrooms. Those are not ideal things. However, having a manager that was rude when a simple question was asked (to open a window) is unacceptable. A simple explanation could have been provided, but instead, a rude response was given, and the manager walked away without further clarification. Turning your back on a paying customer? We have asked the group to change spots for next year as I am sure there are plenty of places that would gladly welcome 200+ people, and their business, for a scheduled event."}
{"text":"High quality beer for every palate!  Health choices for food!  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Great restaurant/bar! Right across the streets from Cobra Arcade. The bartender recommended it and I am glad we have it a try, my brother had fish tacos and I got a BBQ grilled cheese sandwich, both were delicious! They had a lot of different unusual beers in tap with a cool glowing wall describing each one! Got in and seated pretty quick and the best part was the food came out very quick. Our sever Lauren was very nice"}
{"text":"We had a fabulous meal at Angel's Trumpet Ale House tonight.  There were four of us, one had the fish tacos, one the fried chicken sandwich, one had a flat bread pizza and I had the fried chicken salad.  Really good food and prepared just right!!  I like to let people know when I find a great restaurant!!  Try this place, you won't be disappointed!!  Great server too!!"}
{"text":"A group of us came to angel's trumpet yesterday afternoon for an early dinner before a concert.  They don't take reservations but we had no trouble getting a table for 6. Our server was really nice and attentive and was happy to give my sisters a few samples so that they didn't end up with something they didn't like.  All six of us ordered different entrees and they were all fantastic! Overall we had a great experience. 4 stars because I would have liked more ipa's on draft and the parking was a bit of a pain."}
{"text":"angel's trumpet is consistently great - beautiful environment, amazing beer list, and wonderful food. i always like to have the grilled cheese with spam, but everything is always great. the homemade pop tarts are wonderful. i really like their approach to their tap list... when a keg kicks, they don't replace it with the same beer, they replace it with whatever is next in line. this means much more variety, and a little sense of wonder."}
{"text":"This place is such a wonderful little hangout. It's hard to get people to argue against an evening at Angel's, and for great reason. The beer selection will have something for everyone, and the food is pretty darn good. You can drop in for a beer as part of a stroll in the neighborhood, or you can snag a table and post up for several hours. The place can get crowded, but it's not they're fault they're doing the things right.   The staff are great with recommending beers on the 31-draft rotating menu based on what you like, and the prices and ABV are right on the menu as well, so it's hard to be unpleasantly surprised, even if you're not the adventuresome type.  My only critique of this place is that if you prefer spirits or an alcohol-free evening, Angel's has very little to offer. Without the fun of exploring the beer selection, the food goes from \"pretty darn tasty\" to \"I'd rather have gone somewhere else.\""}
{"text":"Food is good. Real good. Burgers, brisket, pulled pork, spam sliders, The Mess!!!! If you can't find a beer, well then..."}
{"text":"Such yummy food. Tractor pizza and avocado, beet, grapefruit salad were so good. Hot wings were amazing, deep fried first. And the pop tarts, omg, yum!"}
{"text":"The beer selection here is fantastic, which is why I keep coming back. They have a huge patio which is great for hanging out with some friends. The food on the other hand, has not impressed me at all, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend coming if you're really hungry.  If you're downtown with a group, and looking for a place to grab a beer, I would highly recommend coming by Angels."}
{"text":"Avoid the ketchup at all costs. It tastes like ground up tomatoes and that's about it, please stick to what you know or try more spices. Hamburger was ok, but the fries, well I will stick to the frozen kind at home. This bar seems to push their beer selection more than anything else, but I wouldn't get your hopes up in regards to the food.  I'll give two stars for effort, but that's it. It's nice that they are trying new things, but move on from what doesn't work. I'm looking at you homemade pop tarts."}
{"text":"I've been to Angel's Trumpet a few times now and it is a must try. If you love beer and food this is the place for you. They have a bunch of different craft beers on tap which may be overwhelming to some but their staff is very knowledgable and willing to help you find a beer you may like. My favorite thing to do is get a flight of beer. You can choose up to 6 different beers in your flight which are about 3oz servings.   The food has never disappointed me. I went recently for happy hour with some friends and a couple of us were able to split one of their flatbreads for only $7. Their food is bar food turned up a notch.  Some favorites: pretzels, poutine, and their \"Nutter\" sandwich add peppered bacon!  Tip: grab a beer and go outside on the patio to play some cornhole (bean bag toss for those who may not know what cornhole is). Definitely a great place to go with some friends!"}
{"text":"I like this place! No, I haven't tried any of the food, but the beer was pretty damn good. And I know it gets a lot of complaints about being overly loud, but give me a freaking break people...it's a BAR! To me, there's nothing worse than going to a quiet, empty bar. My typical reaction is to turn around and walk out. So when I saw that this place is almost always busy, I was down to try it out. I also liked the crowd of people inside...nobody overly snobby or snooty. I think it's the perfect place to stop by for a drink or two with friends. If you're looking for a cozy, date night out, then this is not the place to go. But I will definitely be back to experience a lively night on the town. And I can't wait to try out their patio during the cooler months!"}
{"text":"So I really, really like this place and have recommended it to PHX visitors and suggested it to friends when we are downtown.  My friends seemed to really, really like it too..lol.  They have a large chalkboard with a never ending list of craft beers to choose from..and wine..on tap!  I've had the spud taco, veggie flatbread pizza and avocado salad.  I would stick to the pizza and salad.  The spud taco was a little greasy for my taste.  Nice, sized portions.  I would suggest getting here early to beat the crowds to a table."}
{"text":"I was here with a group for Smunch on Sunday.  Nice thing about a group is you get to try more than one dish.  All of them were OK.  It seemed liked the biggest hit was a scramble with wild game, that week it was boar.  I had a fish cake Benedict, that week the fish was cod.  It was good. Of interest to note: the fish cake was both the protein and the base.  With a group of 8 you would think the food would come out in a 5-10 minute window.  Actually it was more than a 20 minute window.  The waitress was pretty attentive most of the time but a couple of times we had to flag her down.  Two of us drinking coffee had to ask for a refill.  The beer wall gets it own paragraph.  For good reason.   There are something like 30+ beers on tap plus a few wines on tap.  All of them are listed on the wall with a bit of description and their alcohol content.  Some of them are pretty potent.  You can get a flight of 6 sample glasses for $9, you pick which 6 you want to try by filling out a card, which comes back with the flight so you remember what is in each glass.  I wasn't really impressed with the space.  I liked the look but as many have noted it gets pretty noisy as it fills up."}
{"text":"I would give three stars for service and consistency; but bumped it to four because the beer and food are so darn good. If you come, bring your patience and a good attitude. You never know if you'll have to battle a crowd competing for wait staff - or if you'll be blown away by a super knowledgeable, attentive server. Either way, get over it because the atmosphere is awesome - a relaxing, indoor/outdoor, beer lovers haven. As to food, leave judgment at the door and give the spam sliders a chance. I know: Those who grew up on spam are no more anxious to relive childhood trauma. And those who've managed to avoid this long would wonder why start now. Just do it. At least once. It's a novelty done well and a fun food adventure. We also love the flatbreads and TV Tray Tuesday dinners. A great character place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Good food, great beer selection, decent atmosphere, and poor customer service.  I was compelled to try this place because of all the awesome things I have heard about this place and I feel a little compelled to give them a great review . . . maybe I missed something but this place is a hair better than mediocre.  Meal:  I had one of the hamburgers and their version of poutine.  I also had a few of the craft beers.  Taste:  The hamburger was almost tremendous.  I asked for medium rare and came out a hair under well done, but other than that, it was spectacular.  The poutine was very good too . . . maybe not Canadian great but very good. 7 out of 10.  Value:  I thought the highlight of the meal was the portions.  I couldn't finish my burger and poutine.  I came hungry and the prices were more than reasonable. 4 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  Service was extremely slow and the waitress had little to no fucks to give regarding doing her job well.  She botched our order twice.  Rarely came over to check up on drinks where on two or three different occasions I had to flag down another waitress.  She had no clue what was on the menu.  But her beer knowledge was about the same as a 18 year old walking into his first fraternity party and asking for a natty ice.  I would imagine if you work at a place with \"ale house\" in the name, you would know a little about the beers.  There are a 25+ beers on tap so I know its a little hard but for Christ sakes, at least know 4 or 5 really well.  4 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  Decent.  Nothing so special that it left a lasting impression.  3 out of 5.   Overall:  Will I go back?  Probably but only if every other option has been exhausted.  Hopefully the service improves by then . . . 18 out of 30 points, 2 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Was headed to a concert on a Tuesday night in Phoenix and my friends and I wanted to grab some dinner before the show and I have been wanting to try Angels Trumpet for the Tuesday night tv dinner, so this was a win win for me!  The Tuesday night tv dinner for that night was beer battered chicken strips with creamy siracha sauce with zucchini fries, green salad, potato salad and smores for a bangin price of 9 bucks! You really cant beat that!  We were sitting out in the patio area and I was checking out the beer board and decided to go with the #25 (?) the peach tree shaker, this was a solid good choice! It was a great tasting beer!  I've been here before and knew I couldn't leave without getting one of their homemade poptarts! The poptart for the night was a tart cherry with dark chocolate drizzle, it was the perfect end to a delish meal!   If you are in the area, you really should give Angels Trumpet Ale House a try, they have a great selection of beers and selection of food!"}
{"text":"Living so close to this ale house is awesome... gives us a new option in the downtown Phoenix area.  We peddled on over to Angels Trumpet Ale House and noticed a BOATLOAD of bicycles chained together at Angels Trumpet Ale House and across the street at FilmBar's bike rack.  I think they need a larger bike rack... like a large parking lot sized bike rack.  I was worried when I first walked in because there were many people standing at the entrance... but we got right in and were seated (this was a little before 9 on a Friday).    I liked the energy of the place... and how excited the imbibers seemed, however I'm torn... I want to rate it a full four, but then I thought of the loudness and also the \"ok\" food.  I wasn't looking for an intimate evening with my man, but yes, I realized I was shouting after a while.  I saw the overwhelmingly large selection of craft brews on the large chalk board... and really neat looking taps.  I went up to the board and figured out which ones I wanted and got a flight.  I don't drink tons of beer... but I enjoy craft brews.  I did take a peek at their wine selection and was disappointed to see no local wines.  This is a running disappointment for me... but that's for another rant.  But I made my selections and we got a taco appetizer.  The tacos were okay... but the chimichuri was REALLY good.  I found a new love... I REALLY liked the Hazelnut beer.  I'm definitely going back for that one.  I picked a few that weren't totally to my liking... but others that were.  I really like trying a few different flavors.    We ordered the white flatbread pizza... which was a little better than okay.  I don't think it was bad, I just know that I've had better flatbreads in downtown.  Not to say I won't have another... or I won't try some other food there... I've just had better.  So  I'd probably give this a 3.5, because I want to support anything downtown.  I think there are some kinks that need to be worked out... nothing horrendous.  I'm glad to see more local businesses down here.  It warms my heart.  Yay downtown!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and great food.  Burger and grilled cheese were excellent.  Great selection of draft beers."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic! They have a large selection of craft beer and it is constantly changing! My boyfriend and I went here on a Sunday afternoon and they have what is called Sunday fun day where certain beers are only $6 for a pitcher; what a deal! Their food is great as well! I had the grilled cheese and the honey drizzle on it was a stroke of genius! Give this place a check in next time you're in the are you will not be let down!"}
{"text":"It was so packed, busy, and people were kind of rude.  The bathrooms were a little bit of a mess.  The service was slow.  Ok, pros...awesome area out back and great selection of drinks.  The food was very good!"}
{"text":"The 30+ minute wait was worth it! Packed place on the Saturday night I visited. I finally had a chance to check this place out with friends and was not disappointed. Granted, I only had one beer but it turned me onto what is now probably my favorite brew! I had a Lost Coast Brewery Tangerine Wheat. It had the perfect amount of citrus, was lighter on the tummy than say a Blue Moon or Shocktop; the typical Wheat beers that are available at most restaurants.   The temperature of the beer was perfect. Staff was very knowledgeable about the beer selection, which changes every day. Actually, after my glass of Tangerine Wheat, they had just ran out and replaced it on the giant chalk board display with a new wheat selection, it was called Heife WEISS Hell! My visit was complete or else I would have tried that one, too.   I did not eat on this visit but the food passing by for other tables looked delicious. I'll be back for some grub and possibly enjoy a flight next time so I can find my next favorite brew!"}
{"text":"Went there for valentines day around 8pm. Our waiter came about 5mins after we got out seats and we ordered our drinks. I ordered a lemonade and my girlfriend ordered a Mexican bottled coke. 15mins go by and our waiter stopped by and told us they're making our drinks. Finally after another 10mins he brings the coke but never brought me my lemonade. I didn't know it takes 25mins to bring a botttle of coke that they don't even have to pour just open the bottle and take it to the table. Our waiter had terrible customer service. The food overall was pretty good and the atmosphere was nice, just terrible service from the waiter."}
{"text":"We walked into this place and were a little skeptic. We saw a bunch of young people sitting around drinking beer. But it turned out ok. There were families and some older people (our age) there. They have over 30 beers on tap and 6 wines on tap. We don't know much about beer so my husband and I had a flight of 6 beers. It was a great way to try something new. I had the fun-guy flat bread and my husband had the outlaw burger and fries. My friend had the beef brisket grilled cheese. All of the food was amazing! We finished the meal off with homemade blueberry pop tarts and salted chocolate chip cookies. We walked away full and happy! Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"OMG. This place is a gem in the outskirts of downtown Phoenix.  The Avocado salad  with the homemade smoked turkey was outstanding.  The fries were fantastic and my family was fighting over them.  The big guppy was great and comes highly recommended. 810 was good and filling and the homemade ketchup had a special taste.  My sister thinks it has a hint of beer.  The service was very good. I would come again."}
{"text":"This is what locally owned business is all about - in this case, an inspired husband-wife team.  You never know what cold micro brews will be available sourced across the globe - from day to day and from hour to hour. A keg finishes, they hook up a new keg and change the chalkboard listing. Always a surprise - a delightful, delicious surprise.  And the pub grub - best I've ever had anywhere. Full of surprises from a chef bursting with ideas. Fried egg to top off a flatbread pizza, pecan pie pop tarts, wild game sausage with condiments made in house daily ... perfect complements to the delicious offerings on tap.  Downtown might need to be a place to live - people might not want to drive home after sampling the riches on the streets down here!"}
{"text":"I ate here three times during my week-long conference; the food was great and very well-priced, the beer was excellent and the staff were friendly, fast and very knowledgeable about their huge selection of beers on tap.  This place is a short walk from the convention center and adjacent hotels and totally worth it."}
{"text":"Hipster gastro-paradise. Love the food here, but what really sets it apart for me is the IMMENSE selection of craft beers on tap. I'm so picky on what I like, and this place always has something I enjoy. Also, try the wings! Amazing flavor. Four stars because the service could be a little faster."}
{"text":"Love this place and so do my kids. Lots of beers to choose from and try, plus the food is really good. The kids love the free WiFi and pizza.  Any issues that might arise are always addressed and dealt with right away. The staff is always very nice."}
{"text":"Good food, great selections of craft beers and ambiance.  I will totally come back again!"}
{"text":"A favorite downtown bar for me!   Location: This is on 2nd street and a bit hard to find if you don't know. The sign faces south. There is street or metered parking nearby. I am able to walk!  Food:  This is more than just bar food. I have had some of the salads, the hummus, pretzels, peanut butter sandwich, and the homemade poptart.  Everything has been tasty! The pizzas are excellent!  The pretzels are probably one of my favorites. They come with mustard and cheese.  I have also had the fries with gravy (not a fan).   Drink: Multiple local / regional beers are featured, and the cider on tap changes daily.  I absolutely love the ginger cider and the cherry cider. One can order flights of beers of their choice.   Service: For a busy bar, the service is quite good.  I have been at least seven times in the last year, and every single time, the server is checking up on us numerous times. The servers are friendly and helpful also.   Ambiance: There are TVs near the bar, and there's an outside patio area for when it's nice out. They have some games out there, like corn hole ( I hate that name!)   This place can get packed on Thursday and Friday evenings and weekends too."}
{"text":"Great stuff, right in my wheelhouse. 30-some craft brews (some local, many hard-to-find) up on a chalkboard. Start your \"quest for fun\". We were fortunate to get seated right away -- bustling and energetic on a Wednesday night. Friendly, attentive service. The chalkboard can be overwhelming, and our server tried to steer us in the direction of samplers, but my out-of-town buddy & I decided on a funky IPA for me and a local red ale for him. Excellent. Food is pretty much upscale bar food, and done well. Started with a plate of hot soft pretzels -- 4 crispy/soft/salty mini-loaves that hit the spot. On to a stoudt and a pale ale. I had a super grilled chicken sandwich on a fresh roll with bacon, BBQ sauce and fried onion strings. Loved it. His steak sandwich was just as good. One final porter for him and a water for me (I'm driving) and that was it.  We need more places like this in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Always a great selection of beer. Friendly staff. Wings are the best I've ever had. They are very light and crispy. They are different because they use a rice based coating instead of flour."}
{"text":"I Absolutely love this place and all the selections. Only problem in my case majority of the time is the cider selection is slim.  95% of the times we have been here the females as our waitresses have been awesome with service.  As far as the one male my friend and I had during a Sunday lunch hour was so slow and unhelpful and seemed to not care too much about our table.  The Fries are so good with their buffalo wing sauce.  Their Churchill Grilled cheese is absolutely my new favorite as well. My boyfriend loves the 810 with a fried egg and the chicken legs.  I cant wait to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Loved! Great place, nice selection of craft beers and unique flavorful food options. I am in town for business and had one free evening. I was looking for something unique and tasty. Ended up here on my third stop from places near by, that weren't quite what I was looking for. After searching Yelp reviews this was my final stop. I'm a burger connoisseur and had the Brewlee with smoked pork burger. Excellent!! I grabbed their homemade pop tart of the day which is some sort of banana cinnamon vanilla - I didn't even pay attention until I got back to my room and it's still warm... And delicious. Yum!! Leaving PHX AZ satisfied with a good find!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, I did. But their food was nothing to write home about.   I started with the pretzel ball appetizer. The pretzels themselves were delicious. However, the \"nacho cheese\" it came with tasted awful and grainy and the second dipping sauce was horse radish. That's it.   I ordered the old fashioned burger with all the fixings. It just didn't blow me away. I feel like I've had better home made burgers. The fries were over done and I got mostly crumbs.   I'd say the plus side to this place is the beer flights and their beer selection. Can't say I'd be back for the food."}
{"text":"If you love beer then come here.  Great craft tap selection, plus they include the serving glass type.  My favorite menu item, so far, are the SPAM Sliders.  SPAM you say, YES!  Give it a try, it is far different then what you may have been served as a kid.  We always stick with appetizers when coming here and have enjoyed the sausage platter, fries and gravy, and the wings.  I must admit that the only thing I have been WOW'd by were the sliders.  You definitely should give this place a shot and do yourself a favor by ordering a flight of beers to find that one you truly enjoy."}
{"text":"My go to place for craft beer selection and I adore the meat pizza and burgers! The bartenders are very knowledgeable with recommending beer that might fit your palette."}
{"text":"The service was not amazing, but I just don't care.  The food was too outstanding for the service to matter.  And the beer selection... just order your customized tasting tray and you will find out!  My hubby and I are self proclaimed beer snobs, and there were many beers on the menu that a)we had never heard of and b)were super complex and delicious.  Whoever is curating the beer selection is doing a great job.    We ordered two types of tacos ( I forget what they are called on the menu): one fish and the other pulled pork.  They both came with a side of an amazing avocado dip that went perfectly on each type of taco.  The beans that came on the side were so flavorful and smooth.   I may dream about these tacos in the future.   This place seems perfect for after work happy hour.  They have a huge patio and corn hole set-up."}
{"text":"Not bad at all! I had the wings suggested by our waiter. Hubby had The Outlaw (fried chicken sandwich). The wings were fine. Nothing special. They're served with celery, carrots and in house made sauces (ranch, sweet bbq and hot sauce). Hubby said the burger was GREAT. He thought there was too much bread but otherwise good. We also had a flight of six beers. They were great. My favorite was the cranberry cider. I'm not a beer drinker but I do like coders. I was impressed with the flight though. Overall great atmosphere. Our waiter was great and we enjoyed ourselves!!!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Friendly atmosphere. Had the Farm flat bread. Delicious and nutritious! Fun place to go after a dback game. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really hip and fun place for GREAT beers and yummy delux burgers and sandwiches.  Actually loved that the exterior tends to make this place look secret.  GREAT vibe, good service.  Love the crowd that goes here. YAY DOWNTOWN PHOENIX!"}
{"text":"How does yelp know where I've been? I was brought by a friend because I brew my own beer and LOVE this place. Thank you Rory!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and love it. The food is amazing and the beer selection is great. Parking kinda sucks, but well worth it. Prices are great as well. When I'm downtown, this is my go to place to eat."}
{"text":"This place is definitely somewhere you could go when you don't know what type of good you want, but you want good food. There's burgers, tacos, pizza, sandwiches, salads and more. I got the brewle burger which comes with your choice of Chicken, Ground Beef, or Veggie burger, egg, leafy greens, siracha Mayo, cheese, and pickled onion. It was delicious! It was made fresh, the bun was toasted, and so big. I couldn't even eat it all. I will definitely be back to try more things on the menu. The vibe is very casual & represents the Downtown Phoenix vibe so well."}
{"text":"I've bookmarked Angels Trumpet for quite some time and had the opportunity to visit for my lunch break on a Wednesday. To our surprise, there were only two customers in the restaurant. We sat on the patio enjoying the weather. I can totally see this place busy during the weekends and week nights.   Unfortunately, I did not order an alcoholic beverage but I wish I did. Hubby and I ordered the Outlaw burger with fried egg and the pretzels appetizer.   I wish the pretzels were a little softer as they were a little tough to eat. The Outlaw burger and fries were delicious! I loved how they made their season fries.   Closer to the end of our meal, the restaurant started to pick up customers - a lot of customers and it looked like there was only one server so once it started getting busy, we didn't see her. We had to hunt down an employee, which happen to be the host to give us water refills and to ask for our check.   Overall, I plan to visit again especially during TV dinner nights."}
{"text":"We went to this place based off of reviews and I was actually disappointed.  Our server had ZERO personality. I asked for suggestions, as this is our first visit, he literally said, \"I don't know what's good!\"      The beer was good, but the food was bla.  Go for the beer, not the food."}
{"text":"PHOENIX, AZ: Came into town late and arrived just before the kitchen closed.  They were super gracious to whet my appetite with some of their best and well-reviewed fare.    The ambience is cool and very new American (high tables, wood tones, creative understated lighting, music is groovy and a little louder, very casual, a lot of beards eating here).  Tried two server recommendations: the pretzel and the fish tacos.  Pretzels (4.5 stars):  These were very good, among the best pretzels I've had.  The plating was done artistically, the pretzels were soft and spongy, and the dipping cheese and mustard were flavorful.    Guppy Fish Tacos: (5 stars) Outstanding!  Huge fish portions that were fresh and delicious, spicy aoli, excellent guacamole, wonderful salsa.  Every element was right on for these tacos and I enjoyed them tremendously.  The service, ambience and food were excellent on this visit, five stars."}
{"text":"The Angels Trumpet Ale House is a Downtown Phoenix delight. An exhaustive selection of beers combined with a delicious menu for lunch and dinner. One of the largest outdoor patios downtown. Indoor outdoor fun in the sun with a cold beer.  A must stop for a thirsty urban adventure. I have dined there on many occasions and have never been disappointed. Parking can be a challenge at times but worth the visit."}
{"text":"I had reserved a table for a small group of people for happy hour. When we arrived our table had been given to another group. We had to wait 20 mins while they scrambled to put another table together (not a big deal).   Once seated we had to wait 35 mins for someone to come to our table. I believe we had to wait for the next shift to start for our table to be served. Granted they were busy but 35 minutes is crazy.  After everyone arrived I ordered appetizers for the table instructing the server I will be paying for the apps and my drinks. The rest are separate tabs...she said, \"no problem!\" Then comes the bill...to me for the whole table. The server rarely came to our table for service let alone bothering to drop peoples checks. So after all is said and done I'm stuck with a large bill for her incompetence.   On the bright side the food was very good."}
{"text":"We arrived at Angel's Trumpet at 10:30pm last night. After being seated and waiting another 20 minutes for a server to address us we proceeded to try to order out food. The served then asked us if it was 11:00 yet. It was 11:00 on the dot. After informing her that we had been waiting for 20 minutes and could have ordered on time she simply shrugged her shoulders. I have been to this restaurant before and the beer selection is amazing, the food is good, but the service is seriously lacking."}
{"text":"I have been to Angels Trumpet quite a few times since it opened. The servers do not know anything about beer and can never seem to make a logical suggestion to me. They always insist on calling the beers by their numbers instead of the names. The food that I have tried sucks and it is overpriced. I haven't eaten a lot of food there because the veg options blow.  I pride myself in patronizing local businesses and enriching the community of which I am a part, however the owner of this establishment doesn't care about his community. Thanks for tanking the Roosevelt BID, A-hole. You wanna know what's NOT free? My business!  I was already accidentally boycotting Angels Trumpet for quite some time because it sucks. Now I will continue to avoid this place and let my friends know that it's not a downtown-friendly bar. I'll be sharing this with everyone I know."}
{"text":"I like Angels Trumpet Ale House, I really do, but some of their business practices are a little shady.  To be fair, I am writing this review after my third visit within two weeks.  This last time I left unhappy.  I wont throw them completely under the bus though, so I'll start with the good.  The food and ale!   My favorite thing on the menu are the wings, served crispy and naked, sauce on the side.  These wings are delicious!  I always order my wings crispy with little to no sauce, so these are a sure thing for me.   I have also had the grilled cheese made with smoked mozzarella and fontina, honey drizzle, tomato and much more.  Delicious!   Be sure to ask for a smaller size of \"the mess\" appetizer, as your side.  The Mess is their version of poutine.  Really good!  I gave the sausage platter a try this last time, not my favorite.  It was good enough, but didn't blow me away.  Sausage quality is just okay.  I wouldn't order it again.    Moving on to the service...its hit or miss.  Great service once out of three visits?  Disappointing.  The other night was terrible and the server was either really dumb or just plain rude.  One person in my party ordered the avocado salad, which she has had several times prior.  Right away she said this time it doesn't taste right.  She gave it a shot, but it just wasn't right,  so she called the server over to let him know.  He said \"I'll let the manager know\".  He returned and said he could take 50% off for the salad. Really?  50%?  My friend immediately said no and the server stomped off and said \"I'll send her out.\" The manager came out and said \"I never said I would take only 50% off.\"  So...Was our server just trying to pull a fast one on us?  At the end of the salad ordeal, the manager was nice and there was no charge.  However, it was the most awkward experience I have ever witnessed over sending something back.    Now for the bill. Our server said he was going home and did we mind if he brought the checks?  I have no problem with this whatsoever in any restaurant.  He did the work, he should get the tip and not the person he passes the table to.  We were a party of 5, this joker added gratuity to all of our checks.  For a party of 5, really?  He didn't even say anything and I would barely have noticed the way it was slipped in on the check.  I normally don't have a problem with auto gratuity for large parties, but I do for a party of 5.  This guy is a scammer and he ended up shorting himself anyway as we would have tipped more on our own.   I should also point out that Angels Trumpet has no auto gratuity policy as this didn't happen with my party of 12 just a few nights prior.    All in all, I recommend Angels Trumpet Ale House.  Food and drinks are great.  Just beware of shady service and double check your bill!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Placed a phone order for take out that was incorrect on pick up, also they have no clear place for pick up so you have to hover awkwardly at the end of the bar dodging staff as they come in and out. Which is frustrating when you are waiting for your order to be corrected.  If it weren't for that I'd give them 5 starts, one of the best burgers I have ever had albeit I got the outlaw and they forgot the onions and bbq sauce. Their dressings and ketchup all taste like they are made in house, and their side salads are generous and fries well seasoned. Had everything been as ordered, I would have been blown away!"}
{"text":"Have been several times and each time had a great experience. Delicious food, wonderful selection of beers on tap, great service, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Happening place. Lots of 20/30 something cloud. Extensive beer selection. They never have the same beer twice. Food was excellent. Had their big burger. Fries were great and had homemade ketchup."}
{"text":"We arrived around 5pm on their first Saturday night. Bar was full but there were some open spots along the high tops along the windows. The beer list was amazing and, props for using correct glassware for each beer. The reason for the 3 stars was the food. We started out with the chicken wings. I always use these as a barometer for a place that calls itself an ale house. They were served hot, but dry. Three accompanying sauces were served (Ranch?/Some sort of light cinnamon flavored/  and a Tabasco-like spicy one). Unfortunately all 3 sauces failed. Please don't try and re invent the wheel and  don't try and fancy-up wings. Would never order these again. We then split the roasted beet and arugula salad. The roasted beets were fabulous and just the right amount of crumbles. We did not particularly care for the metal plate the salad was served on, as both of us kept getting that metal on metal scrapping feeling when we dug into it. The service was friendly and prompt, our waitress was helpful, although had no idea what we were talking about when we asked about sour ales. I asked because an article had mentioned that it was a favorite of one of the owners. We would go back for a few beers, maybe try something else small off the menu, but at this point I would be hesitant to order a full meal or bring a bunch of people in to eat."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service , food and drink.  I had the crusher  petite surah 2013. My date had agave wheat. Both were wonderful  Alyssa was our server."}
{"text":"This place has become one of my favorites. I love the large craft beer menu! I've never met a beer I didn't like and the flat bread pizza is so yummy. Our server was very friendly and helpful. I told him the type of beer I like and he brought a flight over and they were all delicious!"}
{"text":"Where do you find Angels? in Heaven! Thats right, this is heaven! TAPS TAPS TAPS! So did I mention they have Taps?  By the way this isnt a brewery, they dont brew beer here.  They do however carry a revolving selection of amazing craft beers! While I have only been here once for a few hours, I witnessed several of the beers being changed before my eyes. EXCITING! YES?  The service was great! Sean or Shawn? was great in helping me follow my taste buds to the clouds.  Mat the owner came over and talked to me for a bit as well and just BS'd away. Not a bad way to pass the afternoon or pregame for a show at the Crescent Ballroom.   Prost!"}
{"text":"i love Angels Trumpet Ale House. This is such a cute and hip place for friends to enjoy for beers and excellent creative food. To start, we had their famous spicy spam sliders. Oh man! That was definitely one of most creative sliders that i have ever had. Kudos to Angels Trumpet Ale House to balance out the salty, spicy, and sweet flavor of the spam. This is a must try if you visit here! Furthermore, pick from their over 20 different selections of craft beers! You will start the night well with these. I also had their famous tractor pizza, which was again mind-blowingly amazing. Overall, I really enjoyed the experience there with their wide variety of beer selection and creative food. If you are looking for a fun and relaxing night, Angels Trumpet Ale House is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"My gosh I love this place.  Honestly, one of my favorite places to go with a group of friends or a date night with my husband. Always fantastic food and service. Host/Hostess is super friendly. Beer, well, yeah, the beer is outstanding and the selection is unreal. Great patio for starry nights. Loud, fun vibe!  Only con is the bathroom situation...waiting sucks.   Go eat, drink and be very merry!"}
{"text":"Very pleased with the service, food and beer. Will be coming back to try other dishes.  Ordered: Spam sliders- loved the slaw and the sweetness against some spiciness.  The Mess- it was good but not something i would order again.  Not enough curds for me and a bit of an aftertaste... not sure from what; Chet Burrito- Favorite dish, loved the fries and spiciness in it; Pepperoni Flatbread- my son loved it; Smoked Pork with BBQ- I'm not a huge fennel fan and this was a little more than what I like. but the onions were nice and crispy and the bun was great. Lemonade- eh"}
{"text":"Ate here as a visitor in town and loved it. Excellent menu and draft wines available. Fun atmosphere and walking distance from the convention center. Great for groups!"}
{"text":"Love this place...food is amazing and drinks are great too....nice atmosphere...patio is beautiful!"}
{"text":"solid beer selection thats changed regularly. had the green chili enchilada, very good and hearty...could use more chips with it but good flavor. will be back. solid bartender and staff."}
{"text":"I like this place.  They have over 50 beers on tap; and the \"hot mess\" app is worth ordering.  My burger was good; however there was no seasoning on the meat.  It had great flavor that could have been increased with this simple step.  Grind on the meat was good, the burger was very juicy, and the bread complimented the burger well.    The beer was very good; I picked up a flight; and told them what I liked and what I don't like; and they picked out some samples within those ranges.  They also had some fruity beers; which I wasn't a fan of, but they were good tasting, if you are into that sort of thing."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots!  I am hooked on the spud tacos.  The pizzas are also very delicious, and of course the amazing selection of craft beer.  I have enjoyed everything from Meade to Sours to IPA's and Stouts and everything in between :)"}
{"text":"Pretty loud, but amazing beer selection. Good food as well."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. As a dog lover I am first of all in love with the decor which is photos of dogs which are up for adoption and their stories. In addition they allow dogs on their patio which is so nice. The staff is great. They have a very wide selection of beers on tap and you can get a flight of any 6 they have which is also great. The food is super yummy and the desserts are also great the dessert pizza and home made pop tarts are well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Angel's website is terrible which initially scared me away from dining here. I'm glad I took the risk and went in anyway! Great selection of beers- chalkboard has title, place where it's brewed, type of beer and type of glass listed all for patrons to read. Menu is great too- my table shared \"the mess\" which is their version of poutine and it was delicious. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Perfect for brews! If you are looking for variety and local beers, centrally located, this is your spot. The food is okay, I would not go there for the food, that's for sure. Nice little outdoor patio seating. The parking lot is a little on the little side."}
{"text":"Any time we cant decide where to eat, Angel's Trumpet is our go-to. They have a large seating area, incredible beer and wine list (seriously its a whole wall) and pretty standard but tasty food.  They even have a large patio with outdoor seating, games, and is pet friendly. The only bad part of the place is parking is very limited and the place tends to be packed.   I always go for the Matador but all of their sandwhiches and burgers look amazing. And I love anything on a pretzel bun. They used to have tattertots but the last time I went, I was told they no longer make them (hopefully they started again).  But really the food isnt what brings people into Angel's Trumpet, its good but it isnt anything you couldn't find better somewhere else. What brings people in is their huge tap list, which is always changing. It's their home made poptarts that are incredible, and their Tuesday night TV dinners which change weekly and are only available to first come first serve customers. Ive yet to come in on a Tuesday but I've religiously followed them since the first time I heard about it, and you can see what they'll have on their Facebook. If you're not sure what to think of their expansive drink menu: get a flight of a few beers, try a bit of everything and you're sure to not be let down. The servers are also great at offering suggestions, whether you're trying to pair with your meal or just your personal preference.  The story about Angel's Trumpet is also a pretty cool one, the owner used to own the building for years and when he retired, it was his dream to run a gastropub, so he converted his old office building into Phoenix's very first gastropub. And with all the changes hitting downtown, I love the idea that a local man wanted to create something he loved out of the place he retired rather than just selling the spot to another condominium company."}
{"text":"First time here... everything was excellent.  Great vibe, good service, unique beers, and awesome food.  it was too cold outside but they got a nice patio for when the weather warms up.  I look forward to the next time i return. I want to try the homemade Pop Tarts!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here pretty frequently for a few years. I used to work down the street which made popping in for a post-work beer very easy.  I've since left that job but moved closer to Angel's, so I'm basically a Sunday evening regular at this point.  32 beers on tap, plus about 5 wine selections on tap as well. I'm more a stouts and porters girl, but you never know what you'll find at Angel's! IPAs aplenty, stouts, porters, gose, sours, fruit beers, ales of all kinds, a cider or two, and seasonal beers are all common finds. There's usually 2 on the nitro tap, and a rotating selection of a few Arizona beers.   I mostly sit at the bar when I stop in, and the bartenders are all quite friendly without being overbearing. Some forget to give you a glass of water unless you ask for one, some give you one automatically.  The place is not a sports bar, they have two TVs playing some manner of sporting events (usually football or baseball) with the sound off and closed-captioning. Music is also usually unobtrusive, thanks to their random Pandora offerings. If you're the type who prefers a rowdy, sports-centric bar, Angel's ain't the place for you. If you want a somewhat lively bar with a nice, large patio, extensive beer selection, and solid food options, this is the place.  Oh, the food. Their menu isn't huge, but it delivers in unique-ness. My favorite thing on the menu is the Central, a fried chicken sandwich with lettuce, tomato, pepperjack cheese, bacon, red onion, jalapeño ranch, and cucumber. The cucumber is what makes it, for me. Their fries are quite tasty, thicker than shoestring fries with a house seasoning that may just be seasoned salt for all I know. Be warned -- their ketchup is made in-house, and it's nowhere near the usual Heinz stuff. In my opinion, it would be more complemented by mozzarella sticks than fries, but if you go in knowing it's not your usual ketchup, you might be pleasantly surprised.  I've also tried their soft pretzels app with beer cheese and beer mustard. Very good, light and fluffy hot pretzels. The Outlaw burger is also a solid selection (pretty standard BBQ sauce/bacon/cheese/onion string burger), as is the Matador sandwich (brisket, cheese, horseradish, peppers and onions, if I recall).  I'll be back. Obviously."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, TONS on tap. Also lots of wine to choose from if that's what you are in the mood for. I had their brisket tacos which I highly recommend. Outdoor/indoor patio style seating. A great place to people watch there are a large variety of people from all backgrounds and ages that comes here."}
{"text":"Great spot! Excellent beer selection on tap, and the servers were really helpful picking the right one, or two or three!  Food was excellent. Just the right amount.   Outdoor seating was great!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place! I have been here twice from California and it is consistently great food, cold beer and great service!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm getting too old, but I hate the set up if this place... Concrete with concrete and more concrete makes for a head-splitting experience in a place that could be so perfect for a first date or a night out with old friends. I love that they have so many dark beers on the rotation and delicious pretzels and salads. I'd return, but only when there isn't a rush. I generally like to hear the people I sit with. I'd give the place an additional star (1.5?) if the bar staff even pretended to care I was there."}
{"text":"Delicious food, a phenomenal beer selection and educated friendly staff.  The ambiance and decór of this place is top notch. Their patio is so awesome and they are dog friendly too so they will allow you to bring your pooch to the patio.  My favorite dish I have to get every time I go is the avocado salad without the grapefruit and extra beets instead.   They have speedy Wi-Fi too.  I have studied here or accomplished work before the crowd gets there.  The only downfall is it gets REALLY loud in there and there isn't much parking."}
{"text":"Great place! Beer selection, food and atmosphere inside and out was amazing. I wish I loved in Phoenix because I would go back weekly to try the different selections of beers."}
{"text":"My friends have been ranting and raving about this place for so long, and I finally tried it over the weekend. VERY HAPPY.  I stopped in for a late lunch, and I had the avocado salad. It was filled with fresh produce and flavorful, fresh ingredients. It was exactly what I wanted on a hot AZ summer day. Perfect.   I couldn't leave without trying one of the homemade poptarts. They are seasonal, and the ones I got were pineapple and spiced rum with brown sugar on top. SO SO FAB. It was like biting into heaven.  Will definitely be going back. Lunchtime atmosphere was comfortable. Not too crowded, and there was a ton of good music playing.   Overall A+ experience."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, great ambiance, a great place for a downtown hangout"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Downtown Phoenix. They have such a unique variety food, and it all blends together extremely well. Expect a wait on the weekend, but for good reason. Worth trying!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Great, always-changing beer list that's on a chalkboard, organized by taste. How cool is that? Good, upscale pub-type food with burgers, pizzas, and my favorite, the grilled cheese sandwich. Amazing atmosphere inside. Very \"upscale-hip Phx\" is how I would describe it, although I'm not sure exactly what that means. Quick service, although not always the friendliest. Huge patio. Welcomes kids (thank God! Side note: I am a beer lover who enjoys eating, drinking craft brews, and hanging out with my kids! More places like this please!) Downtown location.  I only wish there was something similar in Vegas!"}
{"text":"On a recomendation for a restaurant in a neighborhood I didnt know very well, Angels Trumpet Ale House it was.  Super easy to find and just steps from the nights final destination FILMBAR. Prior to arrival it was Yelped and Googled and this beer centric gastro pub seemed to be the perfect spot to catch up with an old friend prior to a movie.  My beer recomendation was fine as I took my sugestion of the server that offered 3 THREE fruit beers, because I wanted someting lighter. The peach ale was tasty and I cant wait to get back and try some of the other 9000 beer selections, belly up to the bar, and wash those down with the Poutine or as known there as The Mess.  I have heard about this dish that is a late night staple in Canada. heck all  14,000 Canadians cant be wrong. The chefs must hang out in MY kitchen because they used the perfect amount of fragrant black pepper ( my favorite seasoning) near perfect gravy and plenty of deliciouce fried cheese curds on top of expertly cooked fresh skin on fries. This dish was a perfect 9... or 10 or somewere in between that.  I plan to get around that menu but we both ordered the same thing, a turkey sandwich by the numbers. Mine would have been stellar without any chipotle, but the rest of the fine ingredients overshadowed the one overplayed flavor. The turkey was fresh roasted, great avocado and the VERY BEST toasted bread I have had in years. The side of chips were a great option.  The space is really cool, great chairs and heft tables, if not a tad noisy (screeming baby) prices good and this yelper says its a must try when in the Rossevelt Row."}
{"text":"Great beer selection but the waiter was not really knowledgable. The place became totally packed which is crazy for a Tuesday night. As we looked around we noticed that while everyone had a brew in front of them not many had ordered any food.  We found out why when they brought our orders out. My smokin' legs were more like burnt-to-a-crisp and the veggies spread out over the french fries were limp and tasteless. It was my first time here but my friends had decided to give the kitchen another chance cuz they had the same culinary experience the previous week  We'll probably be back for the beer but someone should fire the cook! Ugh."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot for a beer. Always something new on the menu and if you ask for a recommendation from the staff, you almost always get something worth trying. And... the food is good too! A must-visit for craft beer fans.  Highest recommendation: the Brewlee burger. It comes with a fried egg, peppered bacon, pepper jack cheese, fresh leafy greens, pickled red onion, and Sriracha mayo. The the bun is toasted with a drizzle of caramelized sugar - really puts it over the top. One of the very best gastro burgers in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon during spring training and it's very open. Nice staff. Comfortable seating including outdoor. Lots of taps with great variety.  Food has interesting bar food options. Grilled cheese with bacon jam is great!"}
{"text":"Super impressed by their super quick service. Got our food within fifteen minutes of arrival. Love the beer selection, food is really good but not unforgettable.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went on this past Wednesday evening for the first time. They have a small private lot but it was full when I got there at 4pm. There's plenty of street parking around, both paid and free, so you might have to walk a few yards. The beer menu is a giant chalkboard on one wall. They are numbered for easy ordering and seemed a pretty varied selection. I tried the Moa Breakfast from Moa Brewing, New Zealand and a strawberry blonde from The Brewery in Pine, Arizona. Both were good and very fresh tasting. My dad tried three different IPAs and a couple samples of various beers; he liked them all. I'm do not like IPAs at all but they have plenty of hops-free selections. I was a little sad at their lack of ciders - I was hoping for find a place when at least one new cider on tap but they only had one - Woodchuck - which is good but hardly difficult to find (you can buy a 6-pack of their many varieties at most grocery stores).  I also got the Churchill Grilled Cheese and their \"home made\" \"Pop Tarts\". The grilled cheese is mozzarella and fontina cheese, honey, house pesto, and I added bacon for an additional $1. The tarts were more akin to \"toaster strudels\" and were really good - the flavour of the day/week was grape.   The only major problem (which has been mentioned in a few reviews) are the acoustics. When we first arrived, it wasn't bad because it wasn't that busy but by 6pm, it was full and I had to just about yell across our small table to be able to talk to my dad. Not really a place for conversation.   5 beers, 2 meals, and dessert all came to $70 with a nice tip. A little pricier than I like to go for a dinner but alcohol will easily add up. Nevertheless, I would definitely come back for the selection and the food. Definitely a place to try out when looking for a small, local eatery downtown."}
{"text":"I liked the restaurant environment. The beer selection was really good. I thought the food was just ok. I wouldn't do back to eat but I would go back if I wanted to nice, fun place to enjoy some beers with friends."}
{"text":"First visit was a great one.  Had a blast with good people and tried probably too many beers.  Thankfully I wasn't driving :)  The place was slammed SLAMMED, but some friends had already been there for awhile and had been able to get a table before I showed up so there was no waiting for me.  Straight to the beer!    That said, there's a lot of craft beers that you may never have heard of.  Do the sampler, try as much as possible, that's my philosophy.  Some of this stuff will catch up with you.  The Beast was 19% ABV!   Wut?  :)   Glass wall at the end of the huge cooler gives me something to stare at and drool over.   Love the huge outdoor patio.    Lots of patio heaters out there.     Parking can be a challenge.    The only thing I can think of that might be undesirable is that there are homeless people hanging out just on the other side of the back wall to the patio.  They even have mattresses and junk out there, so it appears as if some of them sleep out there.  I'm not so worried about them, other than that they lend trashiness to the area.  My girlfriend, on the other hand, was a bit uncomfortable with going by herself out to her car to get something she forgot, and I can't blame her, so I went instead.    Great spot, except for the very limited parking, which might force you to have to interact with the homeless people."}
{"text":"Really glad I was able to go here before leaving town. This place is a lot larger than I thought it would be. But just as packed. My friend and I decided to by-pass the wait time and just sit at the bar. Hello beautiful wonderful taps. Why yes, I will sample you. We got ourselves a couple samplers and perused the menu. Some kitchy offerings (spam sliders), and some good old standards.  I decided on their grilled cheese w/ fries. And it was awesome. Not too greasy, and not too cheesy. Yes, that's a thing.  I was told by the patron next to me that I had made a huge error in not ordering the tots, but to each his own. This place has become quite the trendy, sought after spot. If you love craft beer, brave the line/ wait/ heat."}
{"text":"We had a couple beer flights, which is the way to go if you want to sample several of their 31 taps. They rotate the beer selection often, and witnessed them take a beer off the board and replace it with another flavor while we where there. They had a unique selection on tap, not just your IPA, Wit, Lager list.  Jake was our server and he was awesome!! His beer knowledge was on point, and gave us some good suggestions. I had a taquitto appetizer and my buddy had the brisket tacos, all of which had nice flavors. I finished off with homemade pop tarts and an aged chocolate stout, which I will be fondley thinking about for the next few days.   Angels Trumpet has a great vibe with indoor and outdoor seating blended together in a clean yet inviting style. A short walk from the downtown hotels, do I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Have quite a few beers and even wine on tap. Food is really good. They have indoor and outdoor seating depending on your mood and temperature. Pretty good happy hour and other specials."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place after reading a number of the good reviews. I should have read more of the bad ones because unfortunately they better reflect my experience.  The boyfriend and I visited on a Friday night. It was busy so we put our name on the list - no problem. The hostess said it would be about 20 minutes. It was very crowded by the host stand so we went and waited outside, right by the door. 20 minutes came and went and we never saw her come out so we went inside. After a minute or so, the hostess came up to us and said \"oh, I couldn't find you guys. I can seat you now.\" Couldn't find us? We were RIGHT outside the front door. When there are 20 people waiting in the \"lobby\" wouldn't you think to look outside?   So she takes us to our table but did not bring menus so she said she'd be right back. She never came back. The waitress came up to greet us and we had to ask her for menus. She must not have liked that we asked for menus because she was crabby and short with us the rest of the time we were there. (Actually, I assume it's because we didn't order beer. Or she was just a B.)  Boyfriend ordered the burger and I ordered the grilled cheese with spam. We both got fries. The fries were meh, the ketchup was weird - more like pasta sauce and the sandwiches were pretty meh too. They weren't bad but they weren't great. They were forgettable. Writing about my sandwich now I honestly can't really remember it vey well. Not a good thing.  After we finished it took forever to get our bill and they never cleared our plates even though we were clearly done eating. We ended up just shoving them to the side and left with barely a thank you from our waitress.  Needless to say between the crappy service and the sub-par food we won't be back."}
{"text":"Friendly service with a big beer selection. Eat recommendation from bar tender after he said it was the best on the menu. Meh....an underwhelming turkey sandwich with a spicy barbecue sauce. Not the worst just uninspired. Place is just another style over substance eatery."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian all my life and trying different wraps and burgers, this place has super delicious vegetarian wrap."}
{"text":"The beer selection is always nothing short of amazing. And staff is friendly and well educated on the beer and wine on tap. The food here is delicious as well and a bit unique with its taste most notably with the Casper flat bread. But its stellar none the less. Out of the countless times I have been here I have never had a bad experience. Except maybe a wait for a seat at the bar which is okay the beer is more than worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Where to begin....we finally made it to this joint on an event night for beer week. It was nice to see the place packed on a Thursday. The service was prompt and our waiter checked on us a lot even for as busy as it was. The food....wow! Talk about taking some run of the mill items and reinventing them in such a great way! We got a variety of items to try/share. Word to the wise:the portions are quite big. Not some tiny hipster plates that barely touch your appetite. The warm meat platter was amazing. A variety of sausages and sauces that were all spot on. A great way to start off with the amazing selection of pints. Our platter didn't come out right away as it got lost in the shuffle, but our waiter was more than apologetic so I can't really fault them on such a busy night. We also tried the Churchill grilled cheese with spam as an add-on. I can't wait to have this again! We used to have this in Minnesota a lot, but the high quality cheeses they use and bread really make this an amazing dish. My friend had the Nutter Fluffer with bacon add-on. Nutella, bananas, bacon, peanut butter, marshmallow cream. I'm probably missing a couple of items but man was this done right. Every bite was an adventure as each flavor came out. My wife got the mash tacos (I forget the exact name) mashed sweet potatoes, cheese, pesto in a fried shell. More of a quesadilla than taco but again....simply amazing. It's one of those menus you look at and think, \"how would that go together?\" Well it does. Can't wait to get back and try so e more items and beers."}
{"text":"Service is amazing here. Five star restaurant however their cider is hit or miss. Whenever I have called to request a certain type of cider, I get this response...\"what cider are you having on tap?... It's whatever we want to make on that day.\" \"Can you do cherry cider?\" Well that's not what we want to make today.\" Bummer. Consistency is off on a lot of their taps. Don't expect to get the same alcoholic beverage choices next time you come."}
{"text":"Great place. Great beer. Surprisingly good food. Issue with a confused or dishonest waiter. Bill comes and is $51+change. I have a thick stack of 20s in my wallet. I pay with 3 $20 bills--2 old bills & one newer multicolored bill. Waiter returns & says I only paid $50-2 $20s & a $10. But he brings me back a $5 and 5 $1 bills. Huh? I add $2 to settle the bill. Waiter returns to demand $40 more. He claims he returned the entire amount I paid him, including the 2x$20s and now needs $40. We ask for the manager. Manager says she knows I paid with a $10 because she made change for it. But why would you break a $10 bill when you were claiming that I had underpaid & you'd returned all that I had paid. Very unsettling, this situation.  Pay with a credit card here so that there is a clear record!"}
{"text":"Best beer bar in town. There's always something great on tap, plenty of room to sit and in the cooler months, the patio is amazing"}
{"text":"Okay....so my first experience there...I couldn't drink. Damn.  But the beer looked amazing.  Next time!  Food:  I had the smoked chicken legs and seasonal vegetables.  Chicken was really good, a tad dry (but this is likely due to smoking then grilling) and the veggies were spot on delicious and a great variety of carrots, parsnips, and butternut squash.  They meant seasonal and took it seriously....and seasoned them well too!   Pricing: Food--everything was about under $15; flight of beer $9....good prices in my  book. Space:  Looks great!  Very modern and clean, but the outstanding use of wood butcherblock furniture and what appears to be upcycled wood for wall decor warms the place up. Cons: Not a lot to drink if you aren't drinking beers. No coffee, no club soda, no iced tea.  Only offer a handful of wines. They do have a soda fountain somewhere.  I get it. It's a craft brew pub.  No mixed drinks. Only serve the frothy and fermented.  I support that.  But have some decent non-alcoholic bevvys on hand: iced tea, sparkling waters, and good coffee.  You don't need an espresso bar, just a good machine with a high-quality bean, and someone who knows how to make that work.    I'll go back!"}
{"text":"Delish. I love that their menu is unique but familiar, so I'm always open to running with something that's a little out there. This time was the brewlee -- a burger that had some pickled veggies, sriracha mayo, a fried egg, and caramelized sugar on the bun. Cooked perfectly and damned tasty. Service was friendly and available but not overbearing, which I always appreciate.   PS - house made pop tarts intrigued me, but mango covered in caramel is hardly \"seasonal\" in December. I'll have to wait til next time to try one (hopefully with a better flavors ;) )"}
{"text":"Two words: TV DINNER.  That's right, every Tuesday, pop on over to Angel's Trumpet for a massive, hearty, down-home TV dinner served on an actual compartmentalized tray filled with good old fashioned comfort food.   If that brand of gluttony isn't your thing, try any of the sandwiches and you'll be totally satisfied-- the food here is a major highlight, no question.    I'm a wine person so the place gets one demerit for the very limited (and usually not-so-tasty) wine selection.  But because it is billed as an \"ale house\" I can't get too picky about it.  My beer-guzzling family raves about the beer selection and the flights that let you try a little bit of everything.  If they're happy with it, it must be grand!    The atmosphere is my favorite thing about the place.  The lighting is perfect, it's spacious but cozy, and there are a variety of seating options including a great outdoor space.  It's great for small gatherings and large happy hour outings alike.     A few words of advice:  1.  TV dinners start at 6pm and they are limited quantity so don't expect to show up for a late dinner and nab one-- they'll be sold out!  2.  ATAH is closed on Mondays!   3.  They don't open until 3pm Tuesday-Thursday so don't expect to grab lunch or an early happy hour during the week.    Cheers!"}
{"text":"Came here on a sat night at 1125 and there was still a good crowd, not packed/crowded. We were greeted by a very nice lady who informed us that there was only 5 min until last call, but if we decided to stay then we would get served immediately. And we did! Our server was prompt, friendly, and knowledgable about all the different beers they had. The beer that is on tap changes everyday, giving a great variety to choose from. Great ambiance, excellent customer service, I highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"I have been here more than a few times and have always enjoyed the great service and food but tonight I had the pleasure of being waited on by Dakota... he was just excellent!! My buddy and I found out that he has only been serving four months and he was very attentive and kind to us!!! Thank you D.. you rock my man"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service! I went here for my lunch during a work day and they were fast and the food was the most delicious I have ever had for \"bar food\". Great for a Downtown Phoenix stop for lunch or dinner! Plus it has a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Might have been great if the server ever brought us our drinks. Waited 25 min, said something, waited 5 more, and bailed. Not even crowded on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after flying into Phoenix airport.  This location had it all.  Large craft beer menu (probably 30-40 beers on tap), amazing food and a huge covered patio that also offered a set of bags if you were interested in playing.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"They serve delicious, quality food and have an incredible beer selection with a lot of local choices. The only con is the wildly mediocre service. It's not horrible but if they are busy try to order as much as possible at one time because you'll only see the server once every 20 minutes."}
{"text":"We went here based on some of the Yelp collections recommendations, and we enjoyed it. It has a cool vibe inside, albeit a little loud for conversations to be held at times (I work in a auto shop so I'm kind of deaf). It was pretty busy on a Sunday early afternoon, which we kind of expected, and we had to park at a meter down the street which wasn't a big deal. We sat ourselves at a high top and waited for several minutes to be greeted by our server. I did not really care for the stools, as they were kind of uncomfortable, but that's not a huge gripe. After looking through some of the Yelp reviews we had found a couple things that we wanted to try, including the Spud taquitos and the wings. Neither disappointed at all. I did manage to struggle finding a beer that I really wanted which was surprising considering the fact that there was 31 choices. The first beer I ordered the keg blew and they erased it from the board. I was ok with the second choice, but should have stuck with my typical IPA. I ordered a fried chicken sandwich called the Outlaw and my fiancee ordered the fish tacos and both were very good. Our only minor gripes was the slowish service and the uncomfortable stools, but those are so minor that we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lot of beer choices For me a limited menu A little expensive My wife likes skinny beer which they do not offer so this is a one and done for me"}
{"text":"Over all the food was great. I went on a Friday night, service could've been better. I had a burger with he fried egg made to perfection!!!! If you are looking for a sweet drink, try the cranberry cider  the vibe was awesome, young crowd, good music, chill lighting. Not that great for a date (you'll have to wait for a two person table) it can get really loud. Awesome for a couple of friends.  going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Angels Trumpet Ale House is one of the BEST places in downtown Phoenix. The food, drinks, beer and service is top notch! I highly recommend you stop in, and enjoy yourself. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"We stayed in a hotel near the convention center downtown and were very happy to come across Angels Trumpet.  The beer selection was epic and the salads were delicious.  The outside patio also provides great ambiance!"}
{"text":"Lots of beer to choose from here. I love the cycling selection, but it makes me a little sad because I usually don't get to try everything on the list. unless i want to be a raging drunk...which never happens.   I have not tried the food, but all the pictures look delicious.  Get there early if you want to have a group table to enjoy drinks. Otherwise suck it up and wait."}
{"text":"We were there on a Sunday afternoon. The first impression was not good. They are not in a great neighborhood & because of the weeds & over grown plants out front it looked like it was another deserted building.  Because we were meeting friends we went in. It was a Really Nice Space!  Decor fitting the Millennial  taste.  All 5 of us ordered something different & we were all pleased. Burgers, grilled cheese sandwich's & dessert."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  Located in downtown phoenix, the selection of beers is outstanding.  This is my favorite place to eat when attending a downtown event.  With so many great beers, it is nice there is a beer flight of 6 samplers.  The fish tacos are my choice and it is a lot of food.  I would not recommend the fries with gravy.   They are not good, maybe have the gravy on the side.  They took the fries back, so it doesn't affect my 5 star rating."}
{"text":"CenPho's latest is a BEAUTIFUL FULL-ON ALE HOUSE!  Just stopped by to check the place out and was flagged down by the nicest husband and wife team who invited me in!   The place is spectacular! A large spacey room and a huge outdoor patio with an incredible view of Downtown.  I'm from Milwaukee and this place sends me back to \"the way things are supposed to be\" ... it's beer, it's people ... it's HOME!  I can't wait to go back for more!  Oh yeah ... of course they have got a huge looooooooong wall of a gazillion beers on-tap!  Fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"This place looked strange from the outside but the food and atmosphere were great. The service could have been a bit better, but in their defense, the place was packed."}
{"text":"Great beer list, but its a little pricey.  Some of the pints can run $8-$9."}
{"text":"Great beers, nice location within walking distance of other good places (PHX public market, rum bar). staff is real modern young and hip. Be careful not to come Monday's such as I did cause they're closed. Beer selection through the roof. Not a full bar though, just beer and wine. Compare able to ground control in the west valley."}
{"text":"I have visited this place on quite a few occasions, none have been fantastic yet I have come back. Tonight has ruined it forever for me. The manager made a mistake and took no responsibility for it, and blamed her staff.  A few friends met for a birthday get together we drank we ate and we payed our tabs and tipped well. After we had payed our tab before we had started our last drinks, since our server wanted to go home on time. One sip in my friend, who brews beer and is very knowledgable, realized it was not what he had expected from the waitresses description. Since we all work in the service industry my friend was hesitant to even bring up the issue. We convinced him to just ask, which he expected to hear a blatant no because the beer is expensive. He asked and the waitress stated \"Unfortunately we can't resell that beer... but we can get you something else but I will ask that you taste it first.\" Which we understood as we could replace the beer they didn't like with one that he definitely did for no cost. Especially since, without any indication she removed the previous drink from the table. The waitress walked away while rolling her eyes.  After the beer came a check came shortly after. We explained to a different waiter the situation and his response was \"It's only $6.50\". My friend explained that had he known he would be paying for the beer he would not have ordered it but that the last waitress had given the impression that this beer would not be charged. We paid the $6.50. My friend honestly did not want a discount, free food. All he wanted was recognition that a mistake was made and to hopefully prevent this from happening again.  I am currently sitting and listening to the manager (the same waitress that \"explained the policy to us initially\") blame our original waitress for her mistake. \"I can't just say no it's our policy that we don't take any beers back.\" But if you can't say that and you can't take the beer back then you just leave customers confused. She is taking no responsibility for the fact that she caused the entire situation. The drink policy is on the food menu, which if you are sitting and drinking for hours like we were is not visible when ordering drinks.   Train your managers how to speak to customers."}
{"text":"Go here for the beer selection and chose a flight of beer. This place has a fun atmosphere and the food has improved since the restaurant opened. All the flatbreads are solid, tacos are good and the homemade pop tarts are always delicious. Fun place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Huge beer selection with good food.  SPAM sliders were ok.  I guess you have to be more of a SPAM fan than I am.  The burger was awesome thought.  Loved the outdoor patio on a perfect night. It was busy but not packed.  Service was ok."}
{"text":"Outstanding venue!  Was my regular tap house.  Try the Casper Flatbread, outstanding if you like goat cheese.  Nice selection of beers, rotating taps.  A great place to go."}
{"text":"This was an amazing spot! The wait staff is my only concern since the hostess did not seem what was going on but sitting at the bar was the best! I did not eat any food but trying the sampler beers was amazing. I would have wished for a bit more education on the types of beers perhaps next time. Totally going back!"}
{"text":"Popped by for lunch before I had to do some work. Our server came over with waters nearly immediately. I ordered a fantastic cranberry cider. She recommended the pesto grilled cheese sandwich with spam. Yes, spam. IT WAS GREAT. I mean, I could eat that sandwich for lunch everyday. And it's a few blocks from work, so I might!"}
{"text":"I cannot speak for the food, (though the menu looked unique and tantalizing), but the beer selection was great, as was service. We arrived on Saturday night, the first weekend Angels Trumpet was open, around 10 p.m. for drinks. There was a large group of us, 9 people... though there weren't any tables to accomodate our party we were able to stand/be seated comfortably around one of the high-tops.  This place is great for smaller parties who enjoy a good beer. The selection cannot be beat in downtown Phoenix -- 31 craft brews on tap of every taste and style... and they're always rotating. I had the Biere Blonde & White... 4.5% alcohol, light, sunny taste. Reminded me of Four Peak's SunBrew.  The selection ranges from hoppy IPAs at 10% alcohol/volume to the lighter, summer brews and everything in between. There is literally something for everyone, even a few wines on tap for the non-beer drinkers.  Our server was very nice and accommodating.. and though the place was packed she got us our drinks pretty quickly.  A couple reasons I didn't give Angels Trumpet the perfect '5' star rating:  Disorganization-- Seating was sort of a nightmare... and we kind of waited around for one of the high-tops to open up and just snagged it. Ambience-- I enjoyed the nice, open floor plan but the restaurant-style and dozens of tables/chairs was a bit puzzling considering the kitchen was closed when we arrived. I couldn't hear any music above the conversations in the room and the huge, 60\" TV screens weren't turned on. It'd be nice for weekend nights to boast something a little more special. If you're going to close the kitchen, allow people to walk around and mingle more.  Overall, if you're looking for a nice place to kick back with a small group of friends and try some awesome, unique beers on tap, Angels Trumpet is it. Their prices are reasonable for the quality offered. Haven't tried the food, but the menu is pretty diverse offering a spin on traditional bar food like flatbread pizzas and sandwiches."}
{"text":"As bad as I want to give this neat little tap house a full 5 stars, I can't because yo, that bartender chick with the terribly drawn on eyebrows has a hell of an attitude! She also can't pour a beer to save her life so I hope you like a lot of foam. Other than that, the waiters and waitresses are great, the food is better, and the beer selection is the best!!!"}
{"text":"I was immediately impressed by the complete lack of a wait time even though the place was full and bustling on a Friday night. The food seemed artisan and worth the cash, the ambience was hipster with a wide diversity of clientele, and the beer choices were varied and many. I enjoyed this trip because the food was excellent, the price was right, the service perfect, and the atmosphere fun and hip. I recommend coming with a group as opposed to with just one other person, though, because it is loud and has a more raucous vibe."}
{"text":"The food here is always good, best restaurant vibe in Phoenix, and tons of rotating taps. Totally awesome stuff."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. The beer menu is fantastic! It is so fun to have so many choices that you don't usually get! Everyone at the table was happy with their food and drink choices."}
{"text":"I've been there on off nights and now on a Friday night.  I was optimistic about liking this place, but now I just don't want to go there.  It fails in every important regard except pretense. It tries to be semi-fancy with a Bauhaus style minimalist interior decor, carefully plated dainty portions, but the service is abysmal.  Tables are packed in as tight as they can be fit and it's very difficult to move between them. Friday, friends mostly got drinks from the bar and the whole evening, no one came by our table -- not even once.  Yet going to the bar is battle.  It's more like a college bar on game night.  I watched for 20 minutes as the bartenders huddled around the two restaurant computer terminals, waiting their turn and talking, running in and out, avoiding making eye contact with anyone, and occasionally turning around and randomly serving who happened to be right there.  By bad luck, I watched two sets of people surrounding the whole bar get served and didn't get served myself.  You could tell me to suck it up, but I know that in bars on corners, in sketchy music halls, dives, and nicer places, all over Phoenix, there are bartenders who know how to manage crowds with grace.  Good servers are hard to find, especially when you're apparently hiring based on looks.  They have a bunch of inexperienced kids.  While waiting at the bar for 20 minutes, I was asked approximately six times to move so that dirty dishes could be unloaded in front of me, or a server could squeeze by behind or in front of me, but at no point, despite me gesticulating and trying to make eye contact, was I offered a beer.  At no visit on any night has the wait staff been professional or competent.  I imagine ever trying to ask questions about what's on tap or what's coming in would be met with awkward confusion.  This is what I expect of  Mill Avenue on a Friday night. I love beer and I especially love good beer, and this establishment is on in a long string of places opening up across the valley that pretends to deal in that.  Another reviewer complained that they were confused by the beers and their hard to pronounce names, which is funny, because they've taken the step of numbering all of the taps and having people order by number.  The wait staff doesn't know the names of the beers or anything about them either.  And the beers are almost entirely non-extraordinary.  It's mostly stuff that you can get at Safeway in a bottle, year round, which admitted is better than some places with lots of taps where most of the taps are Coors, Bud, etc (that's the only star this place gets from me).  It's not that the beers are bad per se, but things like Oak Creek Brewing Company's Nutbrown and Four Peaks Brewing's Kiltlifter are $5 beers.  Those are also the sort of beer that's often on happy hour.  They're fine drinkin' beers, but charging $7 for them and being uppity about it only makes them seem better to people who have no idea what's going on.  This makes the facade of snottiness but actual ignorance, and the other reviewer's consternation, even more amusing.  A bar behind a Walmart attached to an ice hockey den in my neighborhood, the Icehouse Tavern, has better beers and a better selection, though in bottles.  The Icehouse Tavern also has chill, friendly service that's expertly executed.  Wound-be hipsters looking to enjoy a good beer and praise an interesting venue would do well to go there instead.  Boulders on Broadway in Tempe has better beers on tap and friendly, sane service, even when it's crazy.  Popago Brewing in Scottsdale has better beers on tap and knows theirs beers and though the service isn't fantastic, it's genuine and they know their stuff.  Taste of Tops in Tempe is five stars across the board -- beer, service, ambiance (okay, maybe only four on ambiance -- but still vastly better).  The Filmbar across the street from Angel's Trumpet has some good beers and ambiance and feels a lot less like a college bar where the inexperienced serve the inexperienced in droves.  The Roosevelt, not far away, though often packed, has great ambiance (it's an old brick house in a historic neighborhood), some good beers, though fewer taps, and significantly more accomplished servers. Places like Angels Trump House are able to pack a crowd, but that's it.  They do a disservice to good beer by pretentiously, rudely, and amateurishly serving mostly mediocre brews.  As an apparently independent outfit, I would expect better, not worse, than miserable, cynical attempts at beer snobbery for the sake of it, such as Yard House.  I fear that places like this will just keep awesome establishments that deal in craft beer from setting up in Phoenix."}
{"text":"delish food. great large selection of beer/wine, but waiter seemed a little unknowledgable about the beers, could be a fluke. will def be back, nice outdoor seating"}
{"text":"I found this place completely by accident and was so glad I did!   What a cool brewpub with surprisingly fun beers and experimentally delicious menu!  Initially, the service left a bit to be desired, but after finally being seated, my waitress was fantastic!   I did a flight and I like that you order by beer number and write it down, so there is no confusion as to what you ordered or what you are getting. With the large selection, this is definitely a solid system to have in place. I also like that mix n match is an affordable option here.  I had the reuben, and it was decent and an order of the house made poptarts, which were delicious! An all around solid beer and food find in the Valley of the Sun!"}
{"text":"Simplistic design. Perfect location. Amazing beer selection! Not sure what to try? Order a flight! Six good sized samples that will probably rock your world if you've got a taste for beer! The food menu looks pretty impressive as well but we haven't tried any of the dishes yet.   The only bad thing i have to say about the place is that it seems like most of the servers don't know much about the beers they are selling... You have to order by the tap number... I tried ordering by name and on both occasions two seperate servers replied \"huh?\" and looked really confused. Get some real beer afficianados serving to make it a better experience.   Welcome to the neighborhood and good luck! It's nice to have a beer bar downtown who's owners have a true passion for craft beer!"}
{"text":"Finally!  I finally made it here.  Sheesh.  After a Yelp event over at FilmBar, a friend and I wanted to grab some food/drink.  I looked on my Monocole and realized that this place is directly across the street. Perfect. AND it was a Tuesday night which meant it was TV dinner night!  Thsi place is known for their grown up TV dinners on Tuesday.  I've been wanting to try this for 2 years now.  The 'fancied up\" TV dinners are served on old school compartmentalized plates and feature gourmet renditions of old tv dinner foods.  It didn't disappoint.  My dinner cosisted of an open faced roast beef sandwich with cheese, horseradish and a ciabatta bun.  Delish!  The meat was perfectly tender.  It also included butternut squah, green been casserole, salad, and a cute cherry pie!  I loved it.    What really sold me is the beer offerings.  I'm a beer snob and this place doesn't disappoint.  It's not often I can find a beer I haven't had.  This place had some new options.    My friend opted for one of the pizzas and it was divine. Large enough to share, she clearly had leftovers.  The pizza has chicken, corn, cilantro and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember. But I'll be getting a pizza next.  We sat outside and my only complaint is the misters. I know it's hot and all, but those misters leave you soaking wet. It's like I\"m back in the  South sitting outside or in the rain forest.  Holy smokes."}
{"text":"So disappointed we called 3 times, emailed 3 times, went in once to make a reservation for a party of 25 for our sons rehearsal dinner party.  When I went in I was told to email only, never got response from 3 emails, so I called 3 times was told to email, then was told they would call me back.  I was told on one of those calls \"we don't save tables\".  I explained it was a party of 25 on a Thursday night and felt the cost would go to at least $800 to $1000 all cash!  The employee said he would at least run it by the owner and no matter what get back to me in the next two days. It has been two weeks and no return call.    My son took his fiancé there for their first date, the song they were playing is now their song.  They were so disappointed that we could not do the dinner there...Even just a phone call back or a quick email, saying your money is no good here, we would rather turn it away!  Well Angels Trumpet you don't have to call we are going else where...."}
{"text":"I hope it gets better.  It took nearly an hour to get our food and when we did 2 of the 3 plates we ordered were cold and one of them \"the nutter\" didn't have the extras that we ordered on it.   The lamb sandwich had a good taste but again was cold and the bread took some sawing to get a bite sized piece.  A bit overpriced for what you get.  4 beers an appetizer and 2 sandwiches set us back $63 not including tip.  Service was friendly but very slow.   I really want to like this place, especially since it's in the hood  but as of now I have mixed feelings.   I will probably give it another shot in a month or two."}
{"text":"Beers  pretzels  good location across the street from film bar and arcade bar. I need to come back and try more food. The Porter was excellent from Founder, Michigan."}
{"text":"Great beer! Like 30 beers on tap and they have wine too.  Great atmosphere, waiters are friendly and great music. It's a nice place to chill and try out different beers.   I tend to have their seasonal food items when I go. Food is AMAZING! I have not been disappointed so far.   Their salad was tasty. The pretzel bites are fluffy and baked to perfection!   Their burrito comes with chicharones on the side. Yum!    Their pizza was delicious, thin crust and full of flavor.  I've also had their burgers with fries. Oh and I've had their tacos as well!"}
{"text":"We decided to have a late dinner here right after we flew into AZ. Lucky us! We ordered the spud taquitos (much larger than we expected), full order of wings (cooked to perfection & BOMB accompanying sauces), & meat treat pizza flat bread annnnnd of course they offer a large selection of beers! Our waiter was attentive and had great recommendations."}
{"text":"After 3 visits, it's time for a review. But first, I just have to address some of the other, more negative reviews -   1. \"The chalkboard is confusing\" - No it's not. Find a beer you like the sound of, or the style, tell the server the number. Easy 2. \"The colours of the chalk hurt my eyes\" - really? get some glasses. 3. \"It closes too early\" - come earlier 4. \"It's too busy\" - come later 5. \"I don't like craft beer\" - don't come at all 6. \"I have to share my table, eeew\" - unless you are paying their bill, what's yer problem? make some new friends. 7. \"It's too loud\" - It's a bar, it's supposed to be loud 8. \"the parking lot is too small\" - be thankful that there is a (free) parking lot. There is always street parking or you could ride a bike. 9. \"there's not enough bike parking\" - chain it to a lamppost. 10. \"The beers keep running out\" - it is a rotating selection, they are not running out, they are changing. 11 & 12 \"The beers are too expensive\" - \"Where is the Coors/Bud/Miller?\" - I give up.  The fact that this bar is so unique is probably why so many people are confused and write dumbass reviews. It takes them out of their comfort zone. It is for this very reason that I am giving it 5 stars. Most places are exactly the same as everywhere else and kudos to Angel's Trumpet for daring to be different.  I love the beer selection, I love that I haven't heard of most of them. I also love the food. The onion and blue cheese quesadilla was amazing. The bison BLT in a blanket was a knockout and the avocado salad made my vegetarian girlfriend very happy. The service has been good all 3 visits.  What really blew my mind during the last visit was the quality of the music. When a bar plays The Jam, Madness, The Specials, The Clash, Talking Heads, Depeche Mode, The Police, The Beat, I know there is someone in charge (even if only in charge of the music) with good taste.  One suggestion - the chalkboard on the patio should be raised. It's too low when people sit at the table right next to it and difficult to read. Other than that one, very minor inconvenience, this place is unique and it rocks. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"If you're going to call your place an \"Ale House\", I can't think of a better way to start than 31 taps dispensing a wonderfully broad selection of bier styles from around the world. Probably the best rotating selection in the Valley--you never know what you will find. With this much variety, your best option is to go for the sampler If you like bier--very cost effective with 6 samples for $9. This is one of those pubs that you need to plan ahead and bring a DD with you, because with the ample array of high alcohol biers, you can find yourself \"over the limit\" quickly. The food is good, and the servers were enthusiastic and knowledgeable about both the drink and food options. Of the bier absorbing fare, my choice is the spud tacos, filled with sweet potato, corn and Chihuahua cheese."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I can now safely say that this place is just not my jam.   It's super loud. The food is just so-so. They don't take reservations. They don't seem to have a way to shield the sun from blinding us inside the restaurant during the early evening. Every time I've selected beers for a flight, I only end up kind of liking one. I swear, I like beer. I do! So finding a new brew shouldn't be this rough.   I do like their fish tacos. Quite a bit actually. Same for the giant angel mural by Breeze and Lalo. So there's that."}
{"text":"I love this place!  There is always something great on tap and the food has been amazing on many visits! Tuesday night TV Dinner is fresh but retro! I wish this restaurant was on the west side  so good!"}
{"text":"Date night with my handsome son. Enjoying a nice evening out on the the patio having dinner with downtown Phoenix as the backdrop.  Weather is great, conversation superb.   It's s wonderful life!"}
{"text":"I kind of have a huge crush on Angel Trumpet Ale House! If you don't like noise. Try it on a Sunday afternoon. If you do like noise... Come any other time!   The food here is meh... I don't think the burgers are anything to rave about. The Mess fries are yum! But let me tell you... You should try the PB&J with marshmallow fluff. My son ordered one off the kids menu and it was enormous! He didn't finish which meant Don and I got to try some of it. Amazing! Maybe beyond amazing... Life changing maybe. They make the peanut butter in house and the jelly has some spice to it which I love. And the marshmallow fluff just sends it over the top. I tried to replicate this PB&J at home unsuccessfully. My son will not let me attempt it again.   On to the real good stuff. The BEERS! They have an amazing selection of craft beers from all over. They always have some amazing IPAs and double/imperial IPAs on the beer wall. Always with the different styles of lots of high gravity beers. Totally worth it if you like trying different beers without getting drunk. You can get flights of six different beers for about seven bucks. Don't forget to check out the seasonal menu with specials like on Sundays you can get a pitcher of a local brew for six dollars. Pretty smoking deal if you ask me.   Definitely a place I enjoy and will be returning very very soon!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection! Sure, the menu is \"bar food\", but give it a try - the burgers and the peanut butter flat bread dessert are delish! We've had issues with service but I enjoy the beer and atmosphere too much to care. :) Oh - and the outside area is dog friendly!"}
{"text":"Last night was the THIRD time I have tried to make it in since last year. This last time we showed up at 6pm and the wait was an HOUR because they just decided that evening NOT to serve food on the patio - PLUS there were open tables. The staff has never been very pleasant so I guess it was a sign to head on down the road!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The beers, staff and the atmosphere make this place as amazing as it is. The patio is dog friendly (idk about at night), has misters, corn hole and comfortable seating.  Inside it is very laid back seating great fro groups.  The bar has 6 wines and about 35 beers on tap.  The bartenders and waitress are very knowledgeable and will help you choose a beer that you love.  We prefer to have them help us create a sampler (6 beers) and go from there.  The food is even great!  We have had the pretzels which are amazing the beer cheese makes it.  The pretzel itself is much softer and not as salty as you are probably used to but sooo good.  I have also tried the spam sliders which was AMAZING! haha I know what you are thinking spam gross but it is good and you have to try it!  Only bad thing that I have to say is the parking SUCKS! Carpooling or public transportation are a must!--- Or bring lots of quarters."}
{"text":"If you like beer and good, above-average, pub food, you'll like Angels Trumpet. 35 Rotating taps of beer you don't find at other pubs. Would have earned 5 stars if the hostess, some young girl, wasn't rude. Other servers were great. Knowledgeable about beer and friendly. The space can get chilly as the whole back wall opens to an awesome patio. If you get cold, bring a sweater."}
{"text":"My previous review about the food still applies - absolutely amazing! I got the Brewlee Burger again. I want to try out those homemade poptarts sometime!  A friend and I went here for lunch yesterday. They were fairly busy, but that didn't stop this place from having great service last time I came. We waited (after our drink order was taken) at least fifteen minutes before our food order was taken. It wasn't too much of a problem though (except we were hungry) since we didn't need to be anywhere else afterwards. Once the order was taken we got our food within another fifteen minutes. The service was decent but has been better.  The atmosphere is amazing, like always. I'll definitely be back and continue to recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very fun and they have many unique beers. I thought the food was ok. They plated it nice,  but it was not good enough for me to recommend it to a friend.  Spam sliders really needed a sauce."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places for craft beer and food. I'm here almost once a week. The staff is always cheerful and friendly and the vibe is laid back and unpretentious. I've had several things on the menu, but I'd say by far my favorites are the meat treat pizza, hummus appetizer, and sausage platter. They do a pretty good burger as well. As far as beer selection, it's great. I'm not big on IPA's. I tend to lean more towards the stouts, porters, or sours and they always have a good variety of what I like. Bottom line: I love this place."}
{"text":"Good food, great indoor/outdoor atmosphere and 31 craft beers on tap. Recommend starting with a flight or two to sample."}
{"text":"Great beer, great wait staff and excellent chicken wings and pizza."}
{"text":"It's not a bad place to come and get a drink.  It's not a brewery, they just have a lot of beers on tap. Area is cool as filmbar and cobra are across the street. Had some food and nothing really stood out to me, I don't remember it being bad."}
{"text":"Our second time at Angels and we will be back for a 3rd! Came here after a Dbacks game on a Sunday afternoon. They have $6 pitchers for local beers!!! Awesome! We had a pitcher of Mother Roads black IPA (best black IPA I've ever had) and a pitcher of 4 Peaks Raj IPA. Can't beat that deal. Each pitcher is about 2 glasses so made it $3 a glass. We will make this place a usual stop after Sunday games."}
{"text":"A buddy brought me here last night after going to an escape room event. It was my first time, and I was impressed with the overall vibe. While very busy, it still felt open so you really don't notice it being crowded.  The bar area is tiled in white, which gives it a clean, modern feel. And with 25+ taps most anyone could find a draft they would enjoy. The board also listed wines they have available and the selection appeared to be broad.  The special of the night was a Hawaiian TV dinner which came on a partitioned black tray similar to old style TV dinners. It was a pulled pork sandwich with grilled pineapple and an island inspired BBQ sauce. Sides include a salad with citrus vinaigrette, island style macaroni salad, coconut rice, and a banana cake with cream cheese frosting. All items were excellent.  There was a nice siEd outdoor patio area with abundant misters, but given it was over 110, we opted for inside.  It is worth noting parking is tight, so you might need to park elsewhere and walk in the evening, so an accordingly. Still, this place seems worth the extra effort.  I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Every single time I'm here is more entertaining than the last.  Right now there's a guy who can help you with your beer floats,  he's friendly  and good looking.  The chefs know what they are doing and the beers are always changing. It's got a parking lot and a happy hour.  Woo."}
{"text":"Since moving to Phoenix a bit over a year ago, Angel's Trumpet has become my favorite place to grab a craft beer and a bite to eat.   It's a great spot to meet with a group of friends or to just belly up to the bar and try a new beer. Be prepared for a possible wait if you want a spot at the bar though. I've rarely come here when it's not hoppin' (no beer pun intended... actually that's a great beer pun).  Since they regularly change taps, you'll never get bored of the beer selection. That's truly what keeps me coming back again and again. The atmosphere is laid back and the service has always been friendly as well, so that doesn't hurt the return factor either.   Aaaaaand that's my no non-sense review update, Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great food! Good prices. Nice backyard. Lots of beer. I've been both with friends and with my mom and toddler, and the experience is always positive. The backyard (during the mid-week mid-day) was a great place for my mom and I to lunch while my toddler played. On weekends and evenings the bar is a great place to meet friends for a delicious bite!"}
{"text":"Good bar food with a great selection of beers to choose from.  Nice large patio and great for large party's."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even better patio! Great part of town with nearby metered parking. I was told to order the burger and I did, they were nice enough to sub tots and the whole thing was great! The wait staff was awesome at walking us through the craft beer selection and helped us to pick out beers to sample. I was pleased to find at least three beers that I loved on the menu. After the food was dropped off the place started picking up and we didn't see our waitress for quite a while. We were able to flag someone else down to cash us out but still a very good experience overall."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is horrible. It doesn't matter what time you go or if you order for pickup the customer service is just terrible. I'm usually pretty forgiving and I will never be coming here again."}
{"text":"Just visited for the 1st time. Naked wings are the bomb ! Best in town ! Service was good. A few times the server walked by without looking, but acceptable. I will return.  A++++++"}
{"text":"Maybe I am spoiled, but I'm a little turned off by Angel's Trumpet. I've been there around 5 times, and each time was...\"ehh.\"   Beer selection is good. A little hard to read, but that's my eyes fault. Kinda weird that the waitresses refer to them by numbers.   I don't think I need to flag down a server to either order or pay my bill-that seems counterintuitive to their existence as a restaurant with wait staff. I don't think that I've ever had a greatly outgoing server there. I always feel like I am bothering them.   The food is good. Poutine is good.   There's plenty of other places to go around there. But if you feel the need to try, do it. If not, you're not missing much."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great atmosphere.  Great beer selection.  great food.  Great beer! Wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"I have been on a bit of a mission to find the perfect blend of beer and food, the Gastropub. I think I may have found my favorite. Walking in you are greeted by an enormous chalkboard with the current 31 beers on tap as well as the cask fresh wine. An amazing selection of Arizona and other beers. The red ipa was particularly good. Foods is excellent also, I had the avocado salad and fish tacos which were awesome. Nice people and understated service was good, I could see why people may think service a little rude but the are guys that know their beer and are not in your face over friendly which I kind of like. Go check it out."}
{"text":"I checked out Angels Trumpet Ale house at the tail end of First Friday, on Feb. 6. The space is airy and trendy. I loved the patio with all the lights strung up in the air; it made for very a nice ambiance. I tried their Tripel and it was excellent. It had a sweet finish and a beautiful gold color. It was served with just the right amount of head and it was less bitter than most Tripels I have tasted. I will definitely be back to try one of the flights I saw everyone ordering."}
{"text":"Love new concept restaurants but I'm going to keep an eye on this one. I LOVE beer but I love food more. I'm a lil concerned about this spot because of the limited menu. The Spam sliders are surprisingly good but I do believe eventually they're going to need a full service bar not just beer and wine. The owner and GM are great and I wish them both nothing but great success!!"}
{"text":"My sis recommended this place on our recent visit to Phoenix, and my husband and I were both impressed! Not only with their long list of beer choices (with locations listed, as well as price), but with their menu options as well. I can't remember everything I ordered, but I know we ordered the poutine. So yummy. Canadians got one thing right, I suppose.  We ended up staying most of the night here after eating dinner. The staff were nice and accommodating. The crowd got younger and louder as the night wore on, but it was still a fun place to be.   I wish we were closer, because I want to try one of their tv dinners! We would definitely return."}
{"text":"Decent spot, good place for drinks. Food is creative but seems to describe an experience larger than what's actually served up. Everything seemed \"salty\"...from the Caesar salad to the wings and spam sliders.   Selection of beer is definitely better than the food. If you're a gastropub person, definitely top by but don't plan on a memorable eating experience."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great place! Went on Sunday , Labor Day weekend, and it was busy, lively , and full of character. if someone told me there is a better place for enjoying a great selection of beer,  I would be very skeptical.  The micro brewery selection is incredible! After a long night of enjoying many of our favorite places along the light rail, we stopped in to try some beers. Jeannie isn't a beer drinker, but thoroughly enjoyed her on tap wine! Our beers were tasty and the spam sliders were the perfect late night snack . Count us in as fans!"}
{"text":"Really good food for the price.  I got the casper pizza and hot wings, both were delicious. They have a really beer and wine options. Atmosphere is nice, kinda loud on a busy night. Service was not great,  our server took our order then we never saw him again. We sat at our table for at least 20 min waiting for our check. Still worth going to"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times; one time mid-day when it was not too busy and this time during evening. It was very busy and parking was a little challenging. Fortunately someone was leaving so I took their space. The beer selection is large with more than 25 taps, and all a good variety of styles. They also have wine available if beer isn't your thing. I ordered a stout that I have had before and enjoy. My friend had a cider. This time I also ordered food. Looking over the menu they have a lot of variety, but I happened to see an odd tray someone left on our table. It was a cardboard compartmentalized tray with words written in each box. What the heck? Then I noticed on board by the wall there was a listing of specials. One said TV dinner, and that is what this tray was advertising. The special tonight was a Hawaiian pulled pork sandwich with a grilled pineapple & island sauce, Hawaiian macaroni salad, citrus vinaigrette salad, coconut rice, and banana cake w/ cream cheese frosting. I asked how much and it was $10 and change - cheaper than a burger. I was also intrigued by the special \"Homemade pop tart\", but I didn't order that. I went with the TV dinner and it was a lot of food. The pulled pork was excellent, but the cake stole the show. Man, what I nice meal that was - like no other TV dinner I have had, that's for certain. The décor and ambiance of the bar is relaxing - very open, nice subway tiles, and an excellent staff. I highlight recommend this place."}
{"text":"Our date night... 1. Sausage platter w/ kangaroo as the wild game of the night....my 17 yr old son was upset when he found out we were eating kangaroo jack. I got over it, he was delicious.  2.  Six random beers to sample picked by our waitress. She did good. I recommend  Orange wheat and the rasberry one, forgot what it was called.  3. BBQ brisket grilled cheese & Outlaw burger with fries. I NEVER dip my fries in ketchup but I read they make their own. I finished mine, it was so good.   We were extremely happy with everything that we ordered. It was dark so my pics weren't the best. Gets a bit loud inside. Next time I am sitting outside, and getting a dessert. I must try a pop tart, and chicken plate, and pretzel, and tv dinner, and......   Just go!!"}
{"text":"Visited with a girl friend a few weeks ago for the first time and cannot wait to go back. Great selection of beers on tap, wanted to try something different so the waiter brought over a sample, loved it and ordered. So nice to be able to taste it first.  Fish tacos were AMAZING, as is the grilled cheese.   Will be back for sure.  Only complaint is parking, and that's really a location issue in Downtown, park and walk, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Home run with service, food flavor, price and ambiance. This is my second visit and both times I have had a fantastic experience! I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich that was great! Everyone else at my table enjoy their food immensely."}
{"text":"the interior is not what i was expecting at all. its super bright and almost clinical. wasnt very comfy-feeling. tons of beer and found a great pumpkin ale.  the food was a huge MEH. neither dishes were very good at all. i might come back for a beer if in the neighborhood, but i would go somewhere else to eat first."}
{"text":"The rotating beer selection, location and buffalo (?) bacon dog are great (whatever, I always get the same food). The patio is pretty nice on cooler days. The noise level inside makes me go a little cross-eyed, though the interior decorating is my style. Average all that subjective ish together and it calculates to 3.5 stars. Oh wait, I can't pick 3.5? Fine, I'll round up to 4 because that's the rule in maths."}
{"text":"So happy about the service improvements.  I love this place and always bring people here when they're visiting the Valley. The beer selection is top notch and the food is always great.  I had a few bad experiences here, but they must have gotten rid of some bad seeds, as the service has been exceptional my past few visits."}
{"text":"I only went here once. Not because of anything in particular, just haven't had a reason to go back. The food was good, but a bit expensive in my opinion. When you sit outside on the patio you get an awesome view of the downtown skyline. We walked here but parking seemed to be a bit limited.  Overall, I'd go back and it's a decent place to grab some food or a couple of drinks."}
{"text":"I would really have to nitpick to find much to kvetch about at Angel's Trumpet.  In full disclosure, I know and like Matt, the owner.  My biggest complaint is that the place is not open for lunch.  I was stunned when I suggested the place for lunch, only to find they open late.  The other night, I had three beer snobs out for drinks and dinner.  As always, the beer was fantastic, and the quality of the food has become consistently excellent.  The real star was our server, Chelsea.  Pretty, funny, and prompt without being obtrusive.  She had a ton of tables, and literally ran herself glistening making sure that everyone was taken care of on a hot summer night."}
{"text":"Came here with two teenagers thinking it was a brew pub.   Felt very out of place.  Planned on us drinking a few beers and kids having a few cokes.  Then we would eat a burger etc.   no fountain drinks for kids.  Very limited menu.  Really  a bar with a bunch of microbrews.  No local beers???? We left and went to four peaks brewery"}
{"text":"This was my first time I had been here and I had heard nothing but great things. In my own opinion, the food was just OK, nothing special and the beers were plentiful, but only a good option if you already know a lot about beers. If you don't it can be over whelming. Our server was not helpful in selecting.   Overall, fun place to go with your beer savvy friends!"}
{"text":"Awesome and plentiful beer choices, Spam sliders, homemade pop tarts, Tue TV dinner night, and super friendly bartenders. I'm not sure how it could be better."}
{"text":"I would give it 1 star, but thought that was a bit harsh, and I wasn't there very long.  The whole set up made me very anxious.  The music is deafening and the acoustics and patrons talking make it a difficult place to relax.  They give you a piece of paper and a golf pencil and make you go stand in front of a board and choose your beer, many with which I was not familiar.  There were so many people jostling for position in front of this board and the one over the bar, that it was very off putting to me. There was no clipboard to place the piece of paper on so the golf pencil poked right through immediately.  I asked the waitress why they couldn't print up a menu of beers everyday so people don't have to stand around crowding some board.  She told me because they run out of some beers nightly.  I said back, then the waiters could just tell you what is 86'd as they run out..  They could kinda do like at sushi restaurants, where you check the item you want at your table.  Wanted to love this place, it was utter chaos in there and I couldn't have a conversation with anyone.  I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"In town on business and stopped here.  I am not a beer drinker but the Coppola Pinot Grigio was great. We ordered the hot pretzels, wings, flatbread with pesto-chicken-onions and the fried Cantonese rib let's and the cherry pot tarts.  Everything was great.   31 beers were featured.  Something for everyone.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite place to go downtown for a drink and some good, different bar food. The main room is large with plenty of seating and the outside patio is almost twice as big. It can occasionally be busy but most of the time I've found somewhere to sit quickly.  The burgers are all good, the pizzas are great and the poptarts are a good enough reason to go.  They have a lot of great beer on tap and it's not all your standard fare. Any beer snob would be able to find something worth drinking. They also have a small selection of wine on tap, however the red wine on tap is chilled which I'm not personally fan of, though I know that's popular atm.  All in all I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the beers. Just love it all!!!! Always be there and drink a craft beer! The pretzels and mustard are good"}
{"text":"Beer selection was 5/5 100%.  Food was really meh and heavy. Even for a \"gastropub\" it wasn't what I expected. Service was fine, not bad but not super good. We would come here again, for beer only though."}
{"text":"Really good selection of beers, and very reasonably priced beer specials. Didn't eat anything, but the menu was very original and interesting. Met and talked to some cool folks, good looking crowd. Really liked this place."}
{"text":"Brilliant selection of beers that are always revolving and interesting.  Cool menu choices as well and always has a good vibe.  Can get very busy but we always seem to get served in a reasonable time. If you are into craft beers, then ATAH should be on your list to try."}
{"text":"Love the selection of craft beers on tap. I haven't branched out much with food, but what I have had is amazingly delicious!"}
{"text":"I come home once a year for the Christmas and I all make certain I stop in and have a nice cold Beer and I order the mess with an egg along with their great chicken wings!!  I wish that I could find a place in Wisconsin where I currently live."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere for a downtown spot.  Another yelper and I went on a first Friday and the place was packed.  Hardly any parking and the area behind the ale house is someone else's private lot however many people were parking there and then asked to move it.   The waitress was nice but usually invisible when we needed her. So service wasn't the greatest that night and it was hard to tell who was the staff versus guests.    The food was really good.  We had the flatbread with leeks, bacon and egg, really really good.  Plus fries with gravy and cheese curds, this was a huge serving and will feed a table of four!  Only thing, it took forever to get the food, bur we waited patiently however could not hear each other since it was so loud.  If you go , try to get a table outside. Inside, you will have a conversation with yourself since no one else will be able to hear you.  The beer choices were good and as big as some other places. The glasses weren't that cold either and by the time the food came the beer was warm.I will go back just not on a busy night and will ask to sit outside!.Cheers!"}
{"text":"I love Angels and pay a visit at least once a month but yesterday turned out to be a bad experience. We arrived and we're seated immediately but it took about 10 mins to have a waitress approach us to ask for what drinks we wanted. 25 mins went by and the waitress never came back to take our orders. Idk if they were short staffed or why the service was bad that day but we just ended up leaving."}
{"text":"Decent place with plenty beers on tap. Not a brewery so don't mistake that. Close to ASU downtown so the vibe is college kids on their cell phones talking to everyone else except the person in front of them. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back but wouldn't pass it by if I was thirsty. Salud!"}
{"text":"Great food! The wings are amazing. Pb and j bacon sandwich was different but had so much flavor thanks to the bacon. The burger was perfectly cooked, juicy, a little kick of spicy with an egg over easy."}
{"text":"Beer bar - a lot of places getting titled or tagged as such but few really deserve the moniker.  Angels most certainly does.  If you're looking for high quality beer (and a voracious selection of it), stop here.  The beer selection is exemplary here - around 30-35 taps.  Nice mix of local AZ selections with other world class options.  For examples, there when I was there they options from AleSmith, DogFish, FullSail and other dope breweries.  Ample selection of styles were represented too - not just IPAs - sours, sessions, bourbon-barrel aged stouts - no matter your tastes beer-wise you should be able to find something that suits you here.  They are also on point in terms of glassware for beer - i.e. you aren't going to get served an imperial IPA in a pint glass.   I found the bartenders to be really knowledgable style-wise so definitely ask if you have any questions on style preferences when you are there.  The food menu was also great here - I went here a few times and the option that stood out to me was the big guppy (fish tacos).  You get two tacos with the big guppy but don't let that deceive you - these are BIG tacos.  They come with Angel's \"secret sauce\".  What is - I have no idea - but it is tangy/spicy and fits the dish well. On top of that, the tacos are buried in avocado mash and slaw which adds up to a recipe for success.   Besides the tacos, food options include sandwiches, flatbread pizza and a number of other appetizer-like selections.  As stated before, this is a top notch beer bar and the food delivers too.  Definitely worth a visit if you are in the downtown Phoenix area."}
{"text":"If I could give it 4.9 stars I would... the only gripe I have is the Beer Board... they need to rethink the way they display their beer selection or provide beer menus. I get that the beer menu changes constantly so even more of a reason to make the beer selections clear and easy to read.  Other than that it was a slam dunk, home run, and touch down! In the culinary sense of course. I regret not taking any pictures of our food or beer selections so I'll do my best to describe my experience.  My company was great, the food was inventive, fresh, exciting, and passionately prepared. I had the Fun-Guy flat bread pizza... very rich and fit for two. I chose this because of the mushrooms and goat cheese... it could have used a lot more Fun-Guys and some spice! My company had the fish tacos which I definitely will get the next time I go! Possibly on my top 5 list of fish tacos and I'm originally from California! And I'm Mexican! The fish was fried to perfect crispiness perfection, the cabbage was dressed right and had that little spice you need for a fish taco of this caliber, and the beans! OOOOOH THE BEANS! All I can say is BOOM! Not your typical mexican refried beans but something from another dimension... hats off to the bean chef!   As far as the beer goes... I always fall back on my frustration about beer... Too many beers, not enough brain cells... There was like 30+ different beers on the board so I decided to get a flight as did my company. We shared, we said YUMM, and we said YUCK... All depends on what you like... if you like a diverse selection of great beers you will Love this place!  The prices were VERY reasonable, the atmosphere was comfortably loud, the people pretty, and the music... I don't remember the music... maybe they didnt have any playing... if not they should have..."}
{"text":"The beer menu at the Angel's Trumpet exerts the sort of fascination over me that the Dairy Queen's 20-30 possible milkshake flavors did when I was a wee urchin and DQ still had goodies like pineapple milkshakes. There are about 30 flavors on the big board at any time, and it includes \"weird\" varieties like chicory stout (which was splendid), along with all sorts of microbrews. I cannot possibly actually drink enough to fully appreciate what this place has to offer.  If you're there for food, the ideal is to hit the happy medium of \"a bit of buzz, a bit of clatter\" but stop short of showing up when it's jammed and the servers are starting to look panicky. My first trip hit that medium perfectly (little did I know!) with the result that my Outlaw Burger was Revelatory!Burger, OMG!Burger, SeraphimSingPraises!Burger. It was every juicy, flavorful thing a medium pub burger should be. And in that context, the space is really cool -- it's like a coffeehouse in that there's a sense of community gathering regardless of which specific party you're with.  My second trip was on a swamped day, and my medium burger was well-done. The kitchen's still working with quality ingredients -- the buns are very fine buns -- so even a meh burger is still a pretty good burger and worth the $9. But flights of angels did not actually sing over this burger.  On the up side, the kitchen positively coated the ribbon chips with red and black pepper, and since I love spicy food, that was so far beyond amazing that I considered asking for more, then decided not to push my luck.  Rumor has it that one can ask for take-out and trot the food across the street to FilmBar."}
{"text":"Angel's ketchup is so amazing. I literally go here just to buy Angel's French fries and ketchup!!!! Amazing on top his sells the best burger in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Was out and about this last Saturday with some pals of mine on a bike ride and decided to stop in.  Would have to say I have truly enjoyed ever visit I have had there (always sat at the bar).  Never had a complaint about service. This last time though we took a table outside since the weather was too nice not to take advantage of of the one table that happened to open up outside. Felt lucky considering it seemed to be pretty busy at the time.  We were greeted by our server promptly and provided with water just as quick.  we requested some sample tastings of a few brews and per usual I always appreciate their diligence in offering for us to taste our beer selections before we had them.  Than onto our food orders.  Having a full lunch just before our ride I had decided to stick to my 1 beer for the time we were there. My friends needed food and ordered the wild BLT (Alligator) and some pretzels. I am an avid fan of this place so I made a point to try their plates.  The alligator brat was amazing. would only suggest that it be in a bun rather than a wrap??? wraps seem to better accommodate meats that area cut or sliced. Just my opinion.   The pretzels were great! I am always astounded when I go out to eat and a restaurant cannot gets pretzels and cheese right?? I know I am not the only one thinking this. The portion size was generous so no complaints there either. the ketchup is made in house = Awesome. Can get some real flavors out of it rather than vinegar and sugar.  I only have to knock this review down a star since this time being sat outside I did see a bit of a lag in service times between our food order and drink refills. Nothing we felt we needed to complain about since we were in no rush that evening but I did notice a few tables scanning the floor for their server more than a few times.  side note: last time I had visited the bar was with my roommate and having showed up to an empty restaurant mid day we expected prompt service but were quickly derailed by a bar crawl that came in filling the floor from shoulder to shoulder and taking priority over our service. Was a bit annoyed but again was in no huge rush. but still, Priorities!!  Love the place and the brew selections! ill be visiting again no doubt!"}
{"text":"Great knowledgeable staff taste bud explosion must do when in Phoenix go on weeknight if possible!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit there and I'm glad we went back.  The first time we went there they were serving brunch and I believe they no longer do that.  Which I am glad to see - they brunch dishes weren't that great.  This time we were there about the same time - between 12 noon and 12:30 - on a Sunday and not busy at all.  We had a great server who was easily able to recommend one of the 20+ ales on tap.  I had the Nitro Milk Stout and I cannot remember what he had, but it was similar to a Newcastle Ale which is what he wanted.  We both had one of the flatbread pizzas (Garden and Meat) - very good and enough for a second meal.  We also shared the \"pop tart\" dessert - very good and highly recommend.    This place had a lot of locals because of all the bicycles coming in and a very interesting menu - we are definitely planning to return when we go to the symphony.  This past visit was ate there prior to going to FilmBar - i.e., this brew pub has a pretty good location.....  3/3/13"}
{"text":"My wife and I first visited Angels Trumpet in September 2015 after being told we needed to check it out by some friends from the burbs (apparently this is better than Applebee's). It was kind of \"good enough\" but had some decent beers to give it a notch above mediocre at first take. That said, the server couldn't tell us much about the beers..... I'm pretty sure we got the \"light beer\" vs \"dark beer\" comment, or something of the sort - very disappointing for a server at an ale house (she later admitted, \"I'm not really a beer drinker\"). Overall a kind of \"meh\" experience.  About a month later, a client recommended meeting here and I thought it was worth giving it a second try. This was a better experience than the previous one, but still just not hitting it on the head for me. This place is seriously missing something in the way of ambiance or otherwise. It feels so bland and mediocre, and yet I feel it has so much potential.   I've been back a few times since last fall, reluctantly - to meet up with friends/colleagues - each time getting yet another \"Well, it's not Applebee's, I guess\" kind of experience. As of March, I've decided to put an end to the repeated disappointment. I made my last visit there just before learning that the owner sabotaged an effort to build up the area's appeal to residents like me, which was supported by an awesome group of nearby bars/restaurants and others. Wow, seriously?! Way to ensure that your ambiance never improves! Angel's Trumpet: not Applebee's and not feeling good in the neighborhood. Go somewhere else if you want quality, service, and genuineness from a pub."}
{"text":"Angels never really disappoints! I used to live in the Roosevelt Arts district before moving to NYC and this was a regular spot for me. Since I was back in town it was a must (also because my girlfriend loves beer). Coming back to it reminds me that this form of beer spot is preferred, as I love the idea of a rotating draft list.   I went with a cucumber ale that was very refreshing and an order of wings that were surprisingly delicious. I say this both having taking a short break from being vegan, and also I didn't have high expectations as this was the first time I've ever eaten here.   Overall, great place and will also be a favorite in downtown PHX!"}
{"text":"Great space design and quality beer selection.    I really want to love this place as it's in my neighborhood and I enjoy findingobscure craft and micro brews, but the service is a little slow, they're not knowledgeable about the beers they offer, and the inside space is VERY loud.    The design of the space/building is great.  Great view of the downtown skyline.  But I really wish they didn't build that shade structure that looks so temporary and which draws your attention away from all the other great design elements.  I haven't tried more than 3-4 items on the food menu, so I'm not going to review the food.  What I had seem to be a bit experimental, and was good, but nothing memorable.  With a few adjustments, I think this place will be a great downtown spot."}
{"text":"Our friends have been telling us about this place for a long time. My husband and I finally got to try it out on Friday night. There was a very small wait but we were super lucky to score a spot at the bar while we waited. We were very impressed with the 30+ beers that they had available on tap. We appreciated that each beer had an explanation of the type it was as well. The bartenders were very gracious and even offered samples of beer too. Both beers that I had were completely delicious and the amount I got exceeded my expectations. I believe they were 16 ounces a piece. Our friends also kept telling us about how delicious the food was. My husband and I each got one of the Sammy's (sandwiches). They did not disappoint! I highly recommend the Matador!! For dessert we tried their homemade pop tart which that night was a bananas foster type. So incredibly delicious, it reminded me of a toaster strudel but gourmet. It was quite a busy night and we did have to sit outside, and it was quite warm that night. Hoping to sit inside next time. Will definitely be back to this place!"}
{"text":"Love the varieties of beers and the way they run it with rotations each night as they run out of things, new things replace it. Food is always good but a little pricey."}
{"text":"Two stars for the beer selection: 30+ on tap.  They also have this thing where you can order a flight of 6 beers of your choosing (about 6 oz. each) for $9 if you're undecided on which beer to get.  It comes in a muffin pan.  I ordered the animal burger in beef (you can get it in chicken and pork too), medium-rare.  It was a little overcooked, but still juicy and damn tasty.  The pickled grilled onions went fantastically with the bacon.  The fries were a disappointment because some were soggy and the 'ketchup' sauce on the side tasted like spaghetti sauce.  Our server (Ashley was her name if my beer-impaired memory is not mistaken - she has tats on her calves) was attentive, fast and nice.  Easily found a table here pre-Spring break on a weekday.  Best part of the meal: drunken public cornhole (not what you're thinking - get your mind out of the gutter people).  Otherwise, known as bean bag tossing (ok, seriously, you need to see a psychiatrist if you're still looking for a sexual innuendo).  Loser for each round drinks a shot of beer, making the game everso difficult as time passed by."}
{"text":"Great place for an \"urban\" experience but let's tone down the hipster attitude...you're not that cool.....it's Phoenix."}
{"text":"The beer is always rotating out so there's always something new to sample. I love getting their beer flights. The food is amaze balls. Try the BBQ Brisket grilled cheese! Huge portions packed with tons of flavor."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer selection for those seeking something different! Can be a bit loud. People mix is diverse but may lean hipster."}
{"text":"From a foodie perspective this place wins.  Great bites to eat here.  I would recommend the spam sliders.  They are spot on delicious.  From a craft beer perspective this place has a lot of good choices on tap and a cool canning machine for take home.  It appears no discount for going with a growler price.  Questionable pours for a flight.  Service is middle of the line.  This place could really use a beer expert behind the bar to push it to a 5* establishment."}
{"text":"4 stars for beer variety and flights, 4 stars for service considering how busy it was, 3 stars for atmosphere and no stars for food equals 3 more than fair stars. (Mathlete I was not)  Tons of people crowded this place and with a 15min wait and high stars on yelp I thought this would be solid. I'm learning just because there's a crowd doesn't guarantee good eats. My hummus plate appetizer featured vegetables that looked like they were cut by a 5yr old and the hummus was definitely store- bought or needs some serious recipe editing. Pita bread was most def. store-bought. My husband's burgers were unseasoned and bland. When that man doesn't finish sliders something is very wrong..  Beers were crisp and cold and fun to order on a flight sheet with tons of flavors and brands I never heard of. Lighting was way too bright, I felt like I was an ant in the sun under a magnifying glass, not very complimentary on people's faces. All in all even with the beer choices I won't be coming back, I can get a beer variety for cheaper at Bevmo and make my delicious homemade hummus to top it off."}
{"text":"I love this place, The energy for dinner is electric and the food is absolutely delicious. Plus they have tons of beer to choose from. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Being from Seattle I love the hipster environment!! Although I am not a beer drinker they did have cider and wine on tap, but if you are a beer drinker you will be in heaven! So many to choose from and such a wide variety!! My gf and I came over for the packers vs cardinals game tomorrow and we chose this place for dinner! The brisket and grilled cheese was the best I have had (besides my papas) and that is saying a lot! I am bbq and brisket picky!!! Go here it won't disappoint"}
{"text":"Came here for my second time bringing a hopeful vision to replenish my so-so reflection of prior memory. Beers are always a plus, and I suppose it's an Ale House so the emphasis isn't weighted foodie. With that said I would value it just so, the food is your regular bar food with a new American spin with a focus on fresh. I ordered the Matador which was basically a steak sandwich with a side of fries. Decent it was, amazing it was not. I would come back for a couple brews and a hot pretzel but not again to saturate false hope with a average to good sitting."}
{"text":"idk i really use to like this place. that fun-guy pizza was one of my favorite meals. but the last couple of times when i have gone at night for just a beer or 3, i find myself stranded with no waiter for long stretches of time. additionally, the food just doesnt seem to have that snap, crackle, pop anymore. i have tried the chet burrito, the wings, and the brisket sandwich and they havent been as good as i remember. idk it saddens me. i havent written these guys off but i remember them being better than this"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The pop tarts are pretty much the most delicious thing in existence. It's a weird week if I haven't come here at least once, and it's always consistently wonderful."}
{"text":"Love love love this place, best pub food downtown bar none. Pizza, burgers, and sandwiches...oh and the beer, could go on and on about this place. Meat treat is my fave pizza, 810 is my fave sandwich, big guppy gives you enough fish to feed two people, and burgers I can't decide!! Love this place and it's my go to spot..."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to go here for months after a few suggestions from friends, but mostly just after many times ofdriving or walking past the establishment and seeing it filled with people. After finally deciding to give it a shot, it wasn't long before we wondered why. The service was awful. The bartenders were inattentive and not at all communicative between one another in order to provide adequate service. I didn't think it was possible but the service was even worse once seated at a table outside. The waitress was not at all friendly or even accommodating. She acted as if she could not care less about us or any of our questions. To top it off, I ordered a beer that was then brought to me by some random guy who set it down, said something about it being \"a shorty\", and walking away. Come to find out, this 4.5 ounce beer cost $4.00 because the keg went out. When asked about the price, the manager came over to explain that they don't know when the keg will run out so it was the best they could do, and I was given and charged the price appropriate based on what was left. At this point, I was SHOCKED To find out that all this time, the Angel's Trumpet, did not, in fact, hire psychics to run their establishment for the sole purpose of sensing when each keg will tap throughout he night. Mind blown. Turns out though, despite the lack of psychics and service industry \"professionals\" on staff, the beer, regardless of how full or how great the quality is,still comes at quite the cost. The manager was nice enough to knock about 50 cents off the price of my sub par and anything but full glass, and apparently that was even asking too much by the look on her face and the snobby motions of her hands. I could go on and on, but frankly, I've already arrived at somewhere MUCH cooler that actually has beer that I can drink and I've already given this place more recognition than it deserves."}
{"text":"Tuesday's are Tv Dinner Nights @angels_trumpet_ale_house  Just 8 dollars and you get a redesign of what you thought was a TV dinner in a box, but a TV dinner on a plate!! They put on a different plate every week of the month every Tuesday after 6pm get it fast before it runs out of the night! This right here is a Catfish Po'boy , sweet potato waffle fries w/ Cajun spices. Dirty red beans & rice, fresh shucked corn & basil salad, and the best I thought was the lemon goey bar for dessert! Definitely will come back with the cool downtown Phoenix atmosphere, chill ambience.  #downtownphx #phxeats #azfoodie #foodie #instafood"}
{"text":"Stopped in after work on a weeknight, great vibe...very relaxed.  Service was quick and pleasant.  I wasn't there very long, one beer only but will be back to try their food and a flight.  Parking lot was full at 5 so was able to park on the street nearby."}
{"text":"WOW!  Huge portions, super delicious, funky, just a lot of fun, and a lot of food fo little money!  We all had salads, and they were HUGE!  Delicious, fresh, and packed with goodness to the brim.  I hate beets and I chowed like a goat!  I was the only anti-ale drinker, but I stuck with a refreshing cider.    GREAT service, fantastic food, great value and ambiance!"}
{"text":"The beer selection was amazing. The food was fantastic. I had the beef brisket tacos. Delish. I would like to go back and have the chicken wings they looked mouth watering."}
{"text":"This place was something friends suggested and we went because of their rave reviews. They were totally right. The beer selection is great, the food is unique and delicious, and the atmosphere of the restaurant is modern but also surprisingly cozy. I have made this one of my top places in Phoenix to frequent whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Robbie Williams - Angel)  I sit and wait At Angel Trumpet Ale House And do they know The places where we go When we want a drink...... 'Cause I have been told That their craft beer sets the bars up high So when I'm thirsty for a drink Thoughts running through my head And I feel the love is dead I'm loving Angels Trumpet Ale House instead  And through it all Angel's offers me 31 taps of selection A lot of food and confection Whether I'm right or wrong And down the waterfall  Wherever it may take me I know that life won't break me When I come to call, Angel's won't forsake me I'm loving angels Angels Trumpet Ale House instead.  Angel Trumpet Ale House is located in the heart of the cool and hip part of Phoenix.  What I mean is its where all the hipsters hangout.  It's all good!  I actually enjoy the atmosphere here.  It's not over the top nor do I have to dress my ass off - though I do anyways!  Like most hipster bars, I feel like I should ride my bike with a banana seat except I don't have bike nor would I get one with a banana seat.    Anyways, I ordered a special tonight, which was called the Garfield.  Not sure why really I guess the Chef's name was Mr. Garfield maybe.  It was pretty much a low carb tortilla wrapped with turkey and the fixins' along with some fries.  I didn't think much of it.  My friend ordered the Smokin Legs, which was roasted chicken legs, but she got 3.  It was obviously a lot for her since I think she only ate one and nibbled on her sides.  Needless to say, I'm not a fan of their food!  Then again this is an Ale house!  I really do like this place because their selection of crafted beers.  Daily changes one what is brewing so that's awesome.  Instead of your usual Stella, Bud, or Peroni, Ale house offers some funky ass names and taste I can't describe.  Over 31 selections so it can be overwhelming, but take your time Angel Trumpet isn't going away anytime soon.  I say start with what you usually drink flavor wise and then work your way into the adventure side! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great beer and great people. This a new favorite area for me. Huge, and unique, selection of beers. Love the one keg and move on philosophy. Highly recommend this place for all locals and travelers passing through."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome atmosphere, awesome beer. A little cramped, but who cares? Has a really nice patio area."}
{"text":"As a microbrew enthusiast, nothing quenches my thirst like a beer I've never heard of. Angel's Trumpet has tons of those, and one would be wise to follow their Facebook and keep watch for elusive elixirs like Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA.   Initially, I wasn't impressed with seeing Crispin, Rogue, and Deschutes, but my bartender was able to find the right pint for me. It was categorized as a \"Sahti\", and it is was freaking delicious.   The food here looks like common grub anyone can enjoy (pizza, burgers, etc.) but with an emphasis on finer ingredients. My friend ordered the pop tart, and it looked tons more fancy than your average breakfast snack!  The atmosphere is calm, everything is super clean, and there's a great patio. This is a place to have a nice sit-down dinner, or socialize in a quiet, almost classy environment. I'll be back to try some dinner, and I'll keep my eyes out on the taps!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of beer.  Come here for the beer.  The food is average.  My brisket tacos were adequate, but the brisket was kind of dry. Close your eyes and pick a random beer if you dare...  The ambiance is also excellent - a lot of space, nice wood tables.  A lovely place to enjoy a beverage or become...ahem...a little more inebriated."}
{"text":"The pup-friendly patio, neighborhood location and rotating beer taps are what keep me coming back.  The menu- I like the concept, but the execution could be better (with the exception of the grilled cheese...honey & pesto! Yum!) I have heard good things about the TV Dinners on Tuesday, so maybe I'll have to try that out. I don't think there's much of a happy hour either, maybe a dollar or two off a beer?  The service- Almost always painful, and painful to watch around me, especially at an outside table. Pretty slow, negligent, and they don't seem to care. The strangest thing is nearly every time I have been here, I have been asked to close out so the server can \"get their drink on, too.\" Multiple occasions, all different servers. Were they trained to say this? I get it, but it's also a bit lame.   If you're really lucky, the bar service can be a little better. But then I can't bring my dog which is half of the reason I like this place... & now I just confused myself.  I do keep returning. Guilty.  But not nearly as often, and each time with hopes of improvement."}
{"text":"I want that mural in my house.   Everyone mentions the Spam Sliders, and for good reason too: they're awesome. If you have any hesitancy about Spam, just knock it off! They were so good. Spam sorta tastes like a hotdog, with a different sort of consistency. Topped with feta slaw on a toasted mini bun, they're damn tasty.   You've also got an excellent beer selection. It's chalked up on a huge board by number, with a description and ABV and Price. As the tap runs dry, they erase it and put in a new one. The rotation is ever changing. The servers are also really knowledgable about all of the beers and can give you a taste if you're unsure about a selection. You can also do a flight of six if you're looking for a varied selection of beers. No liquor, but they do have some wines.  The atmosphere is lively and loud and the clientelle is all over the board. If you're a smoker, you've got an outdoor patio with heaters.   This is also a great place for a date. The loud atmosphere makes it a fun place to talk and not feel like you have to whisper or feel awkward if there is a pause in the conversation.   I would absolutely come back!"}
{"text":"Great selection of about 30 mostly European beers along with maybe five wines on tap. A pretty basic food menu. An $11 order of tacos gives you two tasty tacos, probably not enough for a full dinner. Nice, pretty spacious outdoor patio. Definitely go for the beer."}
{"text":"Tried the pizza - with brussels sprouts - amazing! The egg on top is fab!"}
{"text":"I love Angels Trumpet.   Really great space, cool vibe.   Awesome beer selection, and amazing food. The only complaint would be how loud it gets inside, sound just bounces around in that place, but what can you do?  Everything else is so great and I always have such a great time when I am here that after diving in to my beer flight I hardly even notice."}
{"text":"Well I'm a chile relleno eatin' motherf***r, motherf***r!   And let me tell you, I've eaten a LOT of 'em at a LOT of different places and have had some that were a bit lack luster  (i.e. Chino Bandido's Cheez-Its crusted awkward chile relleno) and a lot that were as delicious as I thought (at the time) they could come.   Tonight I had Chef Brian's chile relleno \"TV Dinner\" at Angels Trumpet that officially takes the cake as the BEST chile relleno I've ever had.  No joke.  So good, in fact, that once I'm finished, I should pay my cheque, walk straight into the kitchen and shoot the cook.  Why?  Because this chile relleno was so good that I fear it is upsetting the balance of the universe and that's what I do; I restore balance to this universe.  Although it was Mexican to eat, I was in the mood for a Belgian and after a long process of consideration, ended up taking my server, Brendan's, suggestion and ordered the Affligem Brouwerij, a Belgian Tripel.  This ended up being a PERFECT suggestion for both my beer mood and pairing with the delicious food.    I have never been disappointed with Angels Trumpet and will continue to go there until my level of satisfaction is severly compromised.  I assume that will be approximately never."}
{"text":"Always a great time when I visit here. The variety of beer for the beer snobs, like me, is a welcomed sight. The outdoor seating is comfortable and plentiful."}
{"text":"Well, I just found my favorite brewery. Get the imperial red. That's all I have to say. The appetizers go very well with the beer and I love that there are so many other has that are close by in downtown Phoenix so you can just bar hop! We got the poutine fries. Bro a huge fan of gravy but these were delicious and compliments the beer well.  They have a wide variety of selection to choose from. I have to come back for the homemade pop tarts everyone raves about."}
{"text":"The place is cool, very hipster. Outdoor and indoor seating with a larger and more descriptive beer menu indoors. Four of us sat down ecstatic about their 6 , 6 oz samplers. Unfortunately of the 18 different flavors we chose, collectively we only enjoyed 2. Really wanted to like this place...It was extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"OK I gave this place the benefit of the doubt by visiting a second time but when we visited for lunch they still continue to have major issues with the place. Our food order was once again messed up as it was the previous time we visited. The server also knew little to nothing about the beers they had on tap.  I think it is bizarre that when four people order food at the same time that the kitchen cannot expedite everything so that everyone gets served at the same time."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Walked in and felt an immediate energy from all the patrons. Friendly staff/server.  Ordered the beer flight - so cool to make your own choices - 6 of them to be exact. Spam sliders were divine. Ordered the burger & fries (wife) and the flatbread pizza. It was ALL fantastic! Best thing was the prices. Our tab was $31. Don't know how they stay in business, but I sure appreciated the low bill. In Scottsdale we would have easily paid double for the same exact food. Don't overlook this hidden jem folks, and let's keep them around. They are a real Phoenix treasure."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience all around. Everything on the menu sounded good so the bartender steered me in the right direction with the Va-va-verde tacos. The beer list caters to anyone. I will be going back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good music, great vibe and wonderful wait staff. The wait staff was always ready and willing to help. Always had quick service with drinks and food. Had a wonderful peanut butter, banana and raspberry Chipotle sandwich. The other was a burger with fried onions, fried egg, cheddar cheese and bacon. The side salad that came with the sandwiches were excellent and had a salad dressing that had a horseradish flavor.   Will definitely be returning and trying some Ale next time."}
{"text":"It's a little bit of a walk from the office for lunch, but worth it.    We started with the hummus.  I liked it.  It was more textured than smooth and had a nice flavor.  Liked that it came with cucumbers.  We also had the chips/salsa/bean dip.  The chips were ok.  I generally like thick chips, but many of the chips were soft, which I'm not a fan of.  The salsa was spicy and the bean dip was savory.  I liked it.  For my main, I had the BBQ salad with brisket.  Great flavor and textures.  Just the right amount of lettuce, with lots of vegetables.  The brisket was fine, but the BBQ sauce combined with the dressing provided a nice punch.  Service was a little slow, but I don't think they staff up for lunch.  Seems like more of a pre-entertainment place to go during the evenings.  I liked the space.  Roomy with a hipster vibe."}
{"text":"A few of us stopped in late fit a few beers. The bartender was great. If I lived here I wood be here a lot."}
{"text":"Presentation should never take longer than fermentation. But there I was, still thirsty after 15 minutes of waiting for my pint of Norse Legend. When I ordered it, the waiter didn't know what I was talking about. I told him \"You know, the sahti (I didn't confuse him by pronouncing it Finnish style) from Sam Adams.\" Finally, I just gave him the number on the board. Then he scurried off. We never saw him again.   In the meantime, I checked out the food menu. It looked excellent. But we rolled in just as the kitchen closed at 10 p.m. on a Friday. No appetizers, no desserts, no nothin'.   My wife and I tried talking. But the exposed beams and concrete floors and walls that look so nice turn the volume up to where we had to yell at each other. After a few more minutes of waiting and not seeing a familiar waiter, we did something we've never done at a brewery/alehouse/taproom before: We walked out, still thirsty for a quality beer. We went to Sun Up, where we had a cask-conditioned IPA made with Simcoe hops that pretty well destroyed anything on-tap at Angels Trumpet.  We'll give Angels Trumpet another shot in the future - once we hear it has its act together."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Went with a group and stayed longer than I should have because it was so fab. I loved the open feel and casual set up.   My BF was sooooo excited they had a local brew (Vermonster) from near his hometown. Score for the day!   The service staff was great and helpful with suggestions and tastes. Visit this spot- you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Killer beers and freaking fantastic food everything just rocked except it was very hot in the Resturant, I know it's Phoenix and its 104 outside but air conditioning is a good thing"}
{"text":"We're visiting Phoenix, trying out the Angels Trumpet Ale House on a recommendation overheard from others. This place is incredible! There were 31 craft beers on tap and they served 6 different wines on tap as well. We split the Matador with slaw and the Churchill Grilled Cheese with fries. Both were incredible! We'll be back to Phoenix, to eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Excellent choice of microbrews and food is pretty damn good...love The Mess (poutine) and Burley Burger. Unfortunately, every single time I have been there...the service straight up sucks, so we stopped going. Great vibe of a locals haunt, but you get this pretentious hipster vibe from the waitstaff who take 15 minutes before you see them for the first time, then it's like pulling teeth to get them to come back.there is a fine line of bugging the shit out of people and giving them their space to enjoy them self, but they go to the extreme end of practically ignoring you.  I'm very empathetic to the service industry because I grew up in it, but if you expect people to give you a good tip, much less even return, you need to be attentive and engaging. I'd been 5-6 times bc I love the atmosphere, microbrew and great food, but after the continued attempt at giving them another chance and the same result from the waitstaff...I'm no longer going to waste my time or money."}
{"text":"This place was great!! Walking in you see a large chalkboard with about 30 beers. They are rotating kegs so when one is finished they replace it with another beer from a different brewery. I had an epicenter which was so great tasting. There are letters that are next to the beers which tell you what glasswear the beer is served in. We also had the farm flatbread. Which was also pretty tasty! It was kind of messy though because it wasn't cut all the way and the utensil they give you is a fork and a really dull butter knife. In the end you just give up and grab what you can and just eat. Lol. I think our waitress name was Chelsea. Very friendly and attentive and quick to serve. Will be back here soon!"}
{"text":"Angel's Trumpet Ale House is the perfect addition to the growing Phoenix beer scene. In fact, I've been waiting (with beer-baited breath) for some time now for this place to open, even following the building process on their Facebook page, because it is a great downtown destination for a quality beer after work. With FilmBar right across the street, this block is possibly morphing into one of the coolest parts of town.  Let's talk about the beer. I like the rotating 31 flavors (or is it 32?). Either way, it's more fun than being a kid at Baskin-Robbins, eyeballing the beer selection as one barrel is emptied and another unusual selection takes its place. Sometimes I think it would be better if they had a standard line-up of six beers or so, as it takes some effort to pick a beer that suits your mood. There's a lot of information to absorb from the giant list including brewery, region, beer name, beer style, etc. and many of the beer styles are fairly exotic. However, it is a great beer adventure...  The food at Angel's Trumpet is some good stuff too. I had to try The Nutter after reading a review of this place in a local paper. Get this: peanut butter, bananas, raspberry-chipotle jam PLUS housemade marshmellow fluff and peppered bacon! This was a fabulous grilled sandwich experience you're not likely to encounter elsewhere. The pizzas and Asian-style wings were also pretty damn tasty, so I think they've got all the right elements any respectable alehouse should have.  My only gripe (yet not enough to give them less than five stars) was that it was not made clear that a 20% gratuity would be added to my bill automatically. We started as a group of four that grew to about eight, and the staff was incredibly accommodating. I ended up tipping 20% (on top of the already-included 20%) for my meal, which made things a little pricier than I had anticipated. I want this place to succeed, so I don't feel too bad about over-tipping, I just think they need to mention the automatic gratuity for parties over a certain size."}
{"text":"Great variety of beers on tap, good food and such a chill atmosphere. What more could you ask for?  I'm used to beer gardens like Yard House and was thrilled to find a place that has beers on tap from local breweries to beers from states like Utah, Colorado, California and Hawaii here.  I started off my Sunday with beers with Khoa N. and an order of \"The Mess\" aka poutine. The server was really helpful in helping me pick out a beer, I was feeling like having a Belgian and I concluded with a Belgian Rye Ale from Borderlands, Arizona. Crisp, light, with a bit of bitterness at the end it was refreshing and oh-so-delicious with my mammoth plate of poutine. The poutine was hands down the best I've had (though I've never been to Canada to rightly judge). The fries were seasoned well, great texture, turkey gravy was rich and homey and the cheese curds oozed with the heat of the gravy. Not that's a mess I can deal with! The portion was huge, enough to feed 4 as an appetizer!  The server who helped us was great, gave awesome recommendations and checked back on us frequently. The atmosphere is casual, effortless and reminiscent of many of the restaurants in Seattle- think wood grain, black and open ceiling.  The brews, the food and the service is awesome. Two thumbs up for carrying local brews! I'm all for supporting local businesses. Khoa N. and I inhaled as much food as we could and downed our beer leaving our bellies full and left happily!"}
{"text":"Fun place to hang out on a Saturday afternoon! The spam sliders are crazy good. Awesome service! Beer and wine on tap. Casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"A great place to go and spend a lazy Saturday. The patio is amazing. A robust list of local beers adore a chalkboard above the bar and outside. The food is great asswell, I would recommend the pretzel appetizer and the Chet burrito as a main."}
{"text":"Cute little place! Didn't try the food but great for happy hour on the patio when the weather is nice. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Fun beer flights, good food, casual relaxed atmosphere and pleasant service. I'm always happy to end up here."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Phoenix. It's a must-try for beer enthusiasts; it has a large selection of beer on tap, one of the largest I've seen, and an incredibly lively and unique environment. Angels gives off a very hip vibe and is usually full of younger people looking for a chill night out. The bartenders are fun, personable, and know how to crack a joke. On the food front, while the pizza I ordered was nothing amazing, it was good enough to keep from detracting from the experience, and their pop-tart albeit rich is life-changing. I will definitely be going back to try some of their other beers and hope to try some of their more highly recommended food items (i.e. their fish tacos, spam sliders) when I do."}
{"text":"I discovered Angels Trumpet House after a friend shared with me this place was named one of Phoenix's 50 best places to try. I came here specifically for the grill cheese that was featured on this Top 50 list. Cheese, cheese, cheese all day long I could eat this product...in so many forms. My arteries would not like it but my palette can't get enough. But it did get just enough of the grill cheese on sourdough with several cheeses--not the standard cheddar either. It was tasty but nothing I'm over the moon about. A TON O' BEER on tap, so much local brew adds to the hipness of this place. The ambience reminds me of the food court at IKEA. This restaurant has potential to be something...better."}
{"text":"The house was packed last night. There was a wait list so I told Mat put me down for two.   I gave him my first name and last initial, because this tells Mat we are yelpers and that is a good thing. We head on over to the bar which was packed and in a moment i was acknowledged and ordered two beers off the black board live alerts. I also asked if there was a cask tonight, \"next week\" the sweet gal replied.  Beer number one: König Ludwig Weiss draft poured into a clean shaker glass, this beer is an easy-drinking, satisfying wheat beer with emphasis on predominantly hefeweiss yeast. The flavors are heavy and saturating on the palate, but clean and refreshing. An 84 point beer $6.  Beer number two: Green Flash Trippel poured into a large brandy snifter, hazy orange gold with a tall white head. The beer smells of apples, pears, spices, and malt backbone. The taste is that of a classic trippel. The hops do add some nice balance throughout the beer and the alcohol is well-hidden in the flavor. 83 Points $7.  We walk on to the patio and have a seat while we are waiting for a table to dine. Outside is very comfortable with views the Downtown sky scrapers. There is a quarter moon in conjunction with The Westward Ho tower. It's pretty nice.  Mat comes and finds us happy and chatting away. We walk in and are seated on a two top. I begin asking my neighbors what are you eating. They were super friendly guys and began to show me their food. Drum sticks called Smokin Legs $9 that looked great and a near finished burger$9. Most interesting looking item on the menu was the Bison BLT in a blanket. $8.5. a bison hotdog topped with bacon, seasonal greens, tomato and house made mayo. My gal got herself a Churchhill grilled cheese $8.5 smoked mozzarella and fontina cheese, honey drizzle, seasonal greens and pesto. Side of fries. I ordered more beer.  The house is in need of acoustics. The party was loud but super fun."}
{"text":"After seeing a review on PBS's \"Check Please, Arizona\" months ago, we finally made it down to Phoenix to try the Angels Trumpet Ale House. We chose Tuesday to take advantage of TV Dinner Night and it was uniquely presented and tasty. A great deal for the price. We also would recommend the Fish Tacos.  The inside was loud and vibrant. Everyone appeared to be having fun, but we will sit outside next time if the weather permits.  4 out of 6 glasses of the Beer Flight were really good, but they need to describe their sour beers as sour on their big chalk board. Instead of beers with a hint of fruit, it tasted like a liquid Sour Warhead Candy.   The parking lot is small so bring quarters or plastic for the parking meters on the street.  If you find yourself thereby one afternoon, it is definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"Was there a year ago in the heat and for some reason they had left the doors/walls open! Ugh! But they redeemed themselves on my last visit!  Love that they have wine and beer on draft, their flatbreads are great as are their wing and fries!  A great place to meet friends after work!"}
{"text":"Can sum this place up in a few sentences:  1. Great rotating beer selection (albeit the menu is a challenge to read from several tables.) 2. Amazing large patio (which is great because this place gets overly crowded.) 3. Meh food (but hey it lets you try more beers without falling down.) 4. Loud (you didn't really come here to talk to your friends, did you? Good. Drink more.)"}
{"text":"Great little place in downtown Phoenix. Love the beers on tap, and the menu is delicious! My mom and I came in and had the 810 sandwich and the pizza special, and everything was fantastic. Will absolutely be coming back and recommending to others."}
{"text":"Our server Sean was very nice and very attentive, and the beer selection was unique and satisfying. This place is only missing one thing.. Vegan food options.. Just add like one or two and I wouldn't have to eat before coming in. Other than that I really like this place and plan on coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Unbe-Freakin-lievable. I just had a pizza with Brussels Sprouts and a sunny side up egg. (Not to mention bacon, Caramelized Onion, and pecorino Romano.)  great food, friendly service, dog friendly and all ages blend together perfectly. Wow."}
{"text":"Came here upon my friends recommendation. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have any in house brews but they do carry lots of beers. My brother and I got the flight which are any 6 3oz samples that you want. We also shared a the Tractor Pizza - two farm eggs*, bacon, brussels sprouts, caramelized onions, pecorino romano, smoked mozzarella, roasted tomato sauce. The beers were pretty good. The waitress choose all the IPAs for me as I love IPAs. The pizza was fantastic. Egg was runny and tied the pizza together pretty well.  They have an outdoor area with cornhole and plenty of seating as well. Pretty chill spot to hang when the weather permits. Overall, cool spot. Has TVs with games on. Solid beer and food."}
{"text":"If you're visiting from out of town, I think you'd appreciate this. It's not too Phoenix, but it's in Phoenix which makes it cool. Tons of beers on tap, that change out all the time. So if you're a beer drinker then this is your place. The outside patio is really nice and the vibe inside is great as well. The menu is unique, they make their own catsup and that's interesting. good meat plates and good veggie plates. I'm positive you'll leave here with a smile. The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is that most of the waiters/waitresses I've had were just not up to par in speed and friendliness that you would expect from a place like this. There was just some excitement missing from them."}
{"text":"Hip gastropub with a cool vibe. Most of the ipa's were super hoppy so I didn't care for those, but the food and crow made up for it. Mixed crowd from tattoos to polo shirts. I recommend their pizza with egg on it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! This is not your typical bar, stays pretty well lit during the day and there are no billiards, arcades or other bar games. Nope, in this place the beer is the star!"}
{"text":"This is a must try if you love beer. 30+ beer taps and 6 wines on tap. I used to live in Portland, and this bar has a PDX \"feel\" to it. Great service. Great beer. Great patio. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Everything about this place screams 'awesome downtown scene'. With their HUGE selection of great beers, delicious food (we had the soft pretzel app) and their big back patio, it's hard not to love this dr hangout. The staff at Angels Trumpet is fun, nice, and down to earth, which matches its atmosphere. This may have been my first time here but it will most definitely not be my last.  Overall, if you want to have a good beer in a chill environment, head to Angels Trumpet Ale House."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming here and it was excellent both times. The best thing about it is the beer! There are many different, distinct choices to meet anyone tastes. The outside seating area is nice, you can find shade or bask in the sun. The food is solid. We've experienced the flat bread and wings and would recommend both.  We come to the Phoenix area once a year and could definitely see this place as a yearly tradition to visit. The only weird thing about it is the entrance to the restaurant - it doesn't look like one. Our first visit we did a lap around the building before trying the nondescript door. Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice and both times had good service and delicious food. The fish tacos are amazing, particularly the Big Guppy. They have both indoor and outdoor seating with umbrella heaters outside. There is both table and lounge seating outdoors as well. The parking lot is small and this place is popular so plan for metered parking on side streets - most take debit cards. Due to its location & the arts festivals, this place is VERY busy on the 1st Friday of each month."}
{"text":"What a great place! Brought the dog on the patio and she even got great service! Had the grilled cheese and pumpkin pop tart! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a beer. Especially after having a long hike in the Phoenix summer heat"}
{"text":"Very cool place with good conversation, great beer and food.  Will definitely go back next time in Phoenix.  Try the spam sliders."}
{"text":"I love this place! I tried it last June while my sense of taste was gone.. such a bummer. I have been back since but now that I have a wheat allergy (diagnosed) it isn't as fun beer and food wise. I still take out of towners just for the show of the tap wall. I can drink the wines and they have gladly destructed a wrap or burger for me before. I love the atmosphere and it is a great mellow place for Sunday Funday, though you could make it crazy with a few invited friends!!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not one to write a review but I feel I must in order to to maybe help improve the quality of service at this establishment. We came in and waited a 5-100th minutes while the waiter, who looked right at us when we sat, talked to another patron about different kinds of beers. The service was incredibly slow and there were only 4 other tables with 1-3 people there besides us. The bar area was fuller but the bartender was helping them. We ordered the Brewlee and the Outlaw burger which were really tasty. However the fries were burnt and more than half were inedible. We just left them there....didn't complain cause we thought maybe that's how they were. We looked on the yelp site after and the fries looked totally different and not burnt to a crisp at all. Just a couple of ideas to maybe just be better on service and watch the quality of the food since the burgers are $10 plus."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times over the past couple years withe different groups of friends or dates or solo...  And always with the same result.  I want to like them. It's great beer usually and I appreciate the look/construction.  But parking is atrocious. The service has been horrid on every occasion.  Whether sitting at the bar or at a table, it takes forever to get served or have orders followed up upon to put it mildly.    The food is ok. Not great. Not bad. Just ok for the price.    I keep hoping the service improves, but it just hasn't. It has gotten to the point where I only stop in for rare beer events now. And even then I question if it's worth giving them the money given the lack of service/hospitality.   Recommended.  But only if you're not in a hurry..."}
{"text":"Great place for beer lovers! And their flat-bread pizza is a must have. I like the Tractor."}
{"text":"Made a quick trip to Phx this weekend and while there we decided to check this place out.  Wow! What a great decision on our part.  We wanted something located in the downtown area that offered a good selection of food and brews.  This place was perfect.  We had great service, great food and plenty of good beers.  This will be our \"go to\" spot every time we come to Phx now."}
{"text":"Tuesday Night is TV DINNER NIGHT! woot woot.  Angels Trumpet is a great place for dinner (avocado salad is on point, just like the fish tacos, their hummus and pretzels)  Keep in midn hte portions are BIG, so if you want to save a couple $$s sharing is caring and split some plates!  Oh and did I mention it is cheap? You get your bang for your buck in my opinion. Great flavors, great house wine and beers.  And its dog friendly in the patio!"}
{"text":"My husband is the craft beer lover of the two of us, however, we both loved this place. The staff was very knowledgeable and helpful. Drinks were great, good was yummy (and very unique), the atmosphere was very modern-seemed like the place to be if you frequent the area."}
{"text":"Looking forward to trying this place before it opened. Got to go and I had a good time yet the staff came off as a bit too cool for school. Other than that, great, great beer selection. If your a newbie, try to beer flight for a great introduction.  Good thing to share with friends. The food had variety such as Spam burgers, which are fantastic.  Price about average meaning a little steep ranging from 5-10 for a beer. About usual for these places though. Overall, will probably go back hoping the staff's aloofness was a one time thing."}
{"text":"If you like beers, this is place to go. They have tons of selection. We usually do the flight where we pick 6 types to taste before committing to a pint. Their menu pair well with the beers. They have limited parking, one TV and an open flow to the patio. It's a great place to meet up with a group of friends but it can be very loud and echoie."}
{"text":"Decent service, love the house made ketchup and seasoned fries. Stay away from the 810 the artificial smoke flavoring on the turkey is overwhelmingly chemical and gross. Get the matador instead"}
{"text":"Visited here on a Sunday for lunch.  I had the veggie burger and my husband had the jalapeño burger along with a Pilsner & Amber Ale.  Both burgers were large portions and delicious.  The habanero slaw was ok - hard to keep this dish fresh unless you cook/prepare with each order. Ambiance/patio is great when the weather is nice.  They advertised a tv-dinner menu worth checking out for a future Tuesday evening.  Gave three stars because they did not have all the beers available on the chalkboard menu nor do they serve any domestic beers, which can and would be an option when the selection is sparse (and IMHO it was slim pickings for our palette)!"}
{"text":"Didn't think I could find craft beer in AZ but lo and behold I found this place on yelp nearby and it is awesome with an excellent selection on tap. Place looks hard to find upon arrival but once in it is bustling with folks of all ages. Food is also awesome! Highly recommended for the eloquent drinker in town looking for craft beer."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times now I've had the Casbah Pizza which is absolutely delicious. The mass is also very very good. Tonight I tried a different pizza with lots of wild mushrooms and veggies very very good. My husband tried the barbecue chicken pizza which was also very very good. I haven't had anything yet that is not absolutely wonderful and delicious"}
{"text":"Wow! First and foremost, I was pleasantly surprised by Angels Trumpet! Traditionally, my expectations for food at alcohol establishments is quite low, but this Ale House really brings it with their menu and food!    Our table started with the Pretzel Bites as an appetizer, yum! These come in sets of 4 bread buns with two dipping sauces on the side. The buns are pipping hot and topped with course sea salt and are nice and buttery. After a strong recommendation from my friends who were returners at the establishment, I ordered the BBQ Brisket Grilled Cheese with fries. YUM! This was a heavy, large meal, but it sure was delicious.   To round off our indulgent meal, we decided to order two desserts to share. We got the special, which was a cookie dough and ice cream roll dipped in dark chocolate and the homemade pop tart. Both were amazing. The cookie roll was very unique and the pop tart was hot and flakey and tasted like a pie. I was surprised to find that the food and dessert were both amazing.   The only downfall to this place is how popular it is! We waited about an hour for our table and the place continued to be packed through the night. It is a popular place for large groups and drinks, so you can expect evenings to be packed."}
{"text":"The flights are really fun since they have such an awesome selection of beers!  The decor fits the place great.  Knowledgeable bartenders can give you advice on beer selections and the food was delicious too."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had. I ordered the good ole fashion with a fried egg and my friends ordered the brewlee. We both thought the burgers were delicious. The ketchup they served with the fries was different than normal ketchup it almost tasted like pasta sauce but I was into it. Service was also amazing nice and attentive but also gave us enough space. I liked the atmosphere of the place. The only qualms I had about this place was that the parking lot was small especially for the size of the place."}
{"text":"If I can sum up Angels Trumpet in two words: hipster beer.   It's located in the RoRow district [location along makes anything hipster-ish], and they have a crazy selection of rotating local, seasonal, and craft beers. Both times I've been, the chalkboard has been updated a few times. It's a positive and a negative if you find a really good beer to drink and they run out. Happened to me recently when I came to hang out with friends, and to my surprise the beer I ordered was not the one I drank.   If you have to wait for a table and want to get a [cute cupcake tin] flight, definitely write down beers from the big board while you wait. Don't write down the names, just the #'s as that's how they fill the sample cups. And keep an eye on the board if something changes! They also have a complimentary matching mini board outside if you decide to sit in the patio area.   My first visit was with a fairly large group on a fun light-rail beer crawl we planned. Angels Trumpet was on the plan because of its proximity to the Metro and Yelp told me they have a lot of beer [both true]. One of the girls arrived ahead of most of us so she was able to secure a few high tops next to another - wasn't a problem for the spot. I can't remember our servers name, but he was pretty good for having to deal with ~15 drunk-ish people and all of the beers and food we needed and getting our checks not mixed up. Make sure to order wings mixed in the sauce! They are so bomb dot com.   The most recent time I came my friends and I sat outside as one of the guys brought his puppy! While the beer, wings, and company were fabulous, the service then was just bad. We had a hard time keeping up with our waitress's location when we needed her to order anything, get water refills, and get our checks. I noticed she would disappear for 15min at a time or so. Luckily though another waiter tried to care of us in her absence.  I hope by my next visit that the service improves. Definitely want to check out their cheeky tv dinner and trivia night!"}
{"text":"Love this downtown location! Angel's Trumpet House has a great mix of professional, urban, hipster locals in a great and fun environment.  You can't miss it from the street: with the brightly painted angel mural taking up the full length of the building.  Inside, they have a huge selection of beer, with plenty of seasonal selections. On the most recent outing, I tried a gingerbread lager which hit the seasonal spot.  I haven't met an item on the menu that I don't like. I could go on about the pretzels- amazing! I order them every time I'm there. But I can't overlook the flatbreads or the hamburgers. All are delicious.   During the summer, it is nice to grab a cool brew on the patio (which is also dog friendly).  If you are looking for a great spot downtown- add this to your list!"}
{"text":"A great recommend by someone from work.. a wow culinary experience and a brew pub superb choice . With wines from my own experience in northern Cali a blessing too . Great experience and I look forward to my next visit and I will surely sit outside to enjoy the city view and misters garden zen view. Will be back soon to partake"}
{"text":"This is the best bar that I've ever been to.  When they opened, they had one mediocre thing on the menu, but they removed it.  My friends and I have attempted to try everything on the menu and 3 of us have had everything but the salads.  Sorry, I'll go somewhere else for a salad.  I'm here to overeat and drink great beer.  Try:  spam sliders, pop tart dessert, sausage appetizer, and good luck deciding between the fries with their awesome ketchup or the cranberry coleslaw  They do a good job keeping interesting beers on tap.  I dislike that the flight price went from $9 to $15 though, that kinda ticked me off.  You could bring a date here and split a flight or two and be able to talk without chewing the whole time.  BTW We are the glass stackers!  And last time, we finally broke some glasses.  Well, I did.  I broke your glasses.  :("}
{"text":"Food was great (pretzels and the nutter sandwich were awesome), beers (especially the selection) were great and I loved the vibe and location. Though the service was pretty bad. Took forever for our server to get us anything which turned a quick bite into a long ordeal. I will be back but will not expect to be in and out quick."}
{"text":"Woo! Had a beer flight...fun names for the beers a and quite a variety! Great atmosphere and lively crowds. Wonderful people watching.  Food looked amazing, I can't wait to go back and try some of the dishes myself!"}
{"text":"Super delicious!    I recommend the gaucho (shredded pork tacos)   the burgers looked ridiculous and the wings and warm pretzels were bomb!  Pass on the Cole slaw.  Great prices and awesome selection of drafts."}
{"text":"Love this place for a nice day and some good beer and food. Staff is on it. Been there multiple times and each is helpful when selecting a beer or food and your drink will always be ready for a refill. Love this spot!! Only, you'll need to park down the street and keep up your parking meter, don't ever count on parking in their lot. Still love this spot!!!"}
{"text":"Had the Caesar salad and the outlaw burger. Honestly. Nothing special about the food. They do have a lot of beer but only a basic wine selections, and very cheap wine at that. It is definitely not a date night spot. It is so loud you can't hear and are kind of force to join the loudness because the only way to have a conversation is yelling. To top it off my glass was cracked. That makes me wonder about the judgment of their staff to think it is ok to serve drinks in broken glasses. I left with a headache from the cheap wine and loud crowd."}
{"text":"This place knows beer. I come here for Theology Pub, a thing my local church hosts where we come drink and talk about spirituality on the first sunday of every month. It's great! What I usually do is get a flight of beer (I think they're $9... anyway, the price isn't bad) and try a bunch of different types of beer. Their selections are always changing, so it's hard to say what's my favorite, but I really come here for the new experiences anyway. I also like that it's close to FilmBar (if I want to catch a cool indie film) and other stuff on Roosevelt. I hate how the neighborhood is becoming gentrified, so I hope places like this last a long time. I've eaten the food here once, but can't say I was impressed."}
{"text":"Not family friendly as there are no menus for kids however it is a house of brews and more suited for young adults and a classy laid back crowd. I enjoyed there big guppy tacos but wasn't blown away it was okay not something memorable. My mom and husband ordered the burritos they said they were good. The food was fresh and although they had a small food selection I would come back again. I wish I would have ordered a hamburger and tasted there beer selection although that will be for another adventure overall pretty alright place not at the top of my list but yeah I would go here again... without the kids."}
{"text":"Downtown Phoenix is by no means lacking great places to drink and/or eat. On any particular night you can leave your house walk into a few bars/restaurants and end up in some fabulous places.  One I frequent often is Angel's Trumpets Ale House.  I belly up to this bar for 2 reasons:  1). With 30 some beers on tap that rotate often, (most within the same night!)  I ALWAYS have options. I appreciate a beer adventure - trying as many as possible - so that I can broaden my beer drinking experience/knowledge.  I've found some great favorites here (ie Hopslam, Pranqster, omg GULP) It's like bringing all of the nation's best beer to one conference, located right here at Angel's Trumpets.  2). Space. There is lots of it. The spread is bright and open and with contemporary, upcycled decor - you really can't go wrong. Have a large group of people? No prob! Easy to accommodate. And with that patio in the back...give me a break! This massive patio (now with misters) is perfect for enjoying evenings under the Phoenix skyline.   But the Beer and Space can't sell this place alone. Angel's Trumpets is missing something -an energy, a feeling, an emotional attachment that is found so easily in other places like Lost Leaf, Crescent, or Brat Haus, Four Peaks and even Papago Brewery. Sometimes I feel like I'm eating in a big cafeteria hall (unless I'm on the patio) in which every conversation bounces off the walls and floors. There is never any music playing - which blows as I feel it should be a crucial part of any outing. After all, music, beer, art and food are such important aspects of the downtown culture. I'm still yearning for more - and I'm patiently waiting."}
{"text":"Road tripping across the states & ended up in Phoenix last night. After some research online we found Angels Trumpet and originally went to try their Tuesday special of a TV night dinner.   Sadly, they were out of the TV night dinner as I guess it's a pretty popular thing in Phoenix.   Instead, I went for the grilled cheese & dad went for the special quesadilla of the day. I am a major fan of a grilled cheese, and I definitely wasn't disappointed. I had jalapeños added to mine, which definitely gave it a kick, but I love a bit of spice so it was perfect! Dad's quesadilla was incredible too and we would definitely recommend the food to anyone thinking of going to eat there.   Alongside this, they had a beer flight of 6 tastings for $9 and trust me, their portions are generous. I went for all IPAs, because I'm obsessed and dad went for a different array of drinks.   Anyway, all in all, definitely a must visit if you're ever in Phoenix :)"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's unique and I love all the options! Hubs and I love sitting outside with wine!"}
{"text":"Really good food and awesome beer selection, but the place can get packed at times, and their hours are quite limited. If you have 2 hours for lunch on a Friday, and you want some good beer and good food, you really can't go wrong.   Parking can be somewhat of a hassle, but look at the meters on McKinley if there is nothing available in their parking lot or out front.   Hot tip: if you like variety, their 6-beer sampler is not a terrible deal at $9 because their pours are always more than the advertised 3 oz each. Also, they have a phenomenal selection of stouts right now, if that's your thing."}
{"text":"Went to Angels Trumpet Ale House for beer, but stayed for the food. On Tuesday's they do a cute TV dinner for $9! They had a plateful of variety, enchiladas, a brownie, and more. I've also ordered the homemade pop-tart on separate occasions and it is definitely NOT the type of pop tart that comes out of a box! Happy to report it's gooey and flakey, just like a homemade baked favorite should be. I've also tried their burgers and it's hearty goodness.  And of course, the beers. There's so many beers to choose from it's hard not to find just what you're in the mood for. Solid food and great place to hang out."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, I really did.  My husband and I sat at the bar, and after about a minute my husband had to point out to the bartender that the table needed to be wiped down. Were given menus. We stared at the beer menu on the board, and we probably looked like idiots, but no one ever came over and asked us anything. We finally waved a waiter down. Asked for some suggestions, all i heard was mumbling, didn't want to help, gave us a sheet and told us to put the numbers down of the beers we wanted to try. Gave us our flights, never came over to ask us if we liked anything in particular or if we had any questions... nothing. We also ordered the Porky pizza. The concept is great but there was waaaaaaaayyyyyy to much sage on the pizza, totally overpowering. I had to dig in and take the huge pieces off so I can eat the pizza. We paid, got up, not a thank you for coming, nothing. Don't care.  Thats fine I don't care either and I won't come back.  Go to Four Peaks Brewing in Tempe. Great crowd, great beers, great atmosphere, great bartenders!!!!!!!! Or Brat Haus in Scottsdale!! Great food and servers are very knowledgeable and actually CARE if you like the beer or not!!"}
{"text":"Was on a walk in downtown Phoenix and as I walked by was reminded I hadn't eaten here in awhile. No reason other than absentmindedness. So I decided to grab lunch.   First, this is one of those fun hip (yeah I realize using that word may make people question eating here but don't.) places just off downtown. It has a huge beer selection that cover a broad spectrum of tastes from a variety of brewers.   Second, the food here is great. In the past I've had wings and several sandwiches, all exceeding expectations. Today, was no different.   I have 5 words for you: bbq beef brisket grilled cheese! What more could you ask for! The brisket was tender and juicy and the sauce was not overpowering. The cheese was gooey and perfectly melted me it was served on thick white bread, grilled perfectly to be crunchy on the outside but soft inside. Plus it soaked up all the sauce so nothing was lost. It truly was a delicious sandwich. Now I got the coleslaw today and unlike a traditional slaw, this was a oil and vinegar based slaw but lightly dressed. It had a nice covering of feta which gave a tangy salty finish to each bite, plus had craisins mixed in for a sweet balance to the salty feta.   All in all, lunch was great. Perfect way to break up a Friday."}
{"text":"Fun, quirky place with plenty of drinks to choose from. I appreciated that they had a cider for me to choose as I don't drink beer. I thoroughly enjoyed the fish tacos for dinner and friends all had burgers. Very delicious! Favorite thing was the pretzel appetizers that we had to get because we were so hungry. Friendly service and decent prices for the quality of food we got. Only downside was the wait. It was 9pm on a Friday and when we walked in, we were told 15 minutes. However it was almost an hour. We stood there the entire time (a group of 3) near the hostesses and they never once reassured us that it would be soon. A friend went up to them to ask if it would be soon and they couldn't give us an answer. We were pretty hangry by the time we got our food. That's the only downside, though."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times now and I can say that I've had a wonderful experience each time.   TONS of rotating beers daily, ~$5 beers, ~$11 beer flights, AMAZING burgers, yummy appetizers. I have yet to be disappointed. If you are looking for a nice quiet place, this is definitely not the place. This place is loud and full of energy.   There is a VERY small free parking lot in front, but good luck getting parking there. But you'll easily find street/meter parking nearby.   Environment: 5/5 Food: 5/5 Price: 4/5 Service: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Food...Da' BOMB! Prices...Reasonable. Service...Da' BOMB!  Highlight: Nice atmosphere and ambiance w/ a vast beer selection."}
{"text":"This is my updated review.  I originally reviewed in February, and I have gone back to Angels Trumpet Ale House a couple times after that.  My second time was in the summer, I stopped in for some beers during art walk and I ordered the poutine again.  I was so thoroughly surprised about how much the dish improved.  It was absolutely fantastic and was even better than home (they put green onions on top which were a great addition).    The most recent trip was for lunch during the weekend.  We stopped by for lunch before hitting up a matinee at the Film Bar that is right across the street.  The patio was a great way to enjoy the weather and drink a couple beers.  I ordered a burger with an egg on top.  I was never so impressed with the presentation of the burger.  The bun had a since shine to it.  It came with a huge side of fries that are very good.  Because of these more recent experiences and the quality of the food, I have increased my rating."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to hang out, great date spot, tons of beers on tap, decent food (sandwich and burgers are the best). Great atmosphere. Staff is friendly. Beers available will change as you sit there so if you find something in a flight you like better order a full one quick. That's Part of the fun."}
{"text":"Just moved to Phoenix from San Diego, CA which is known for its craft beer bars. This was a wonderful taste of home, lots of great rare beers on draft and cool ambience. Bar staff was very pleasant and knowledgeable as well."}
{"text":"This is a sneaky little hidden place but some how crowed. The menu has a very diverse set of eats, however, I've only tried 2 of their dishes. 1 a salad with some kind of champagne vinaigrette and burger of some sort, fully equipped with a pretzel bun. One thing thats tried and true is the beer sampler that I remember well :)"}
{"text":"First time here. Service was awful and slow af, on a Thursday night at around 9 pm. There was hardly anyone there so it's not like they were busy. The bartender was a stuck up, rude, hipster, bitch. Like come on, smile, fake it, and work for your damn tips. I wondered how the hell she even got hired. It was my friend's and I's first time and we met a group of 4 people there who had already racked up a bill of at least $75. They also said she had been rude all night to them as well, ignoring them and rolling her eyes at every little thing. I wanted to slap the attitude right off her face. We were so nice, polite and patient with her, for her to be treating us like shit. After ordering our drinks, which took 10-15 minutes with a bar that only had 5 people at, we closed our tabs immediately and moved to a big table hoping to be served by waitress instead. But there was no waitress to be seen, my friend went up to the hostess after about 20 minutes of sitting there, then she sent someone over to us. She was nice but kind of an airhead. She brought the food to us and there was a long black hair on the pizza. Sent it back and got another one, it was delicious. Also the beer I was drinking was wonderful, my friends enjoyed their beers as well. Yet it was $9.65 for the smallest glass of beer I've ever seen.. I want to come back here for the beer and food but that horrible service is really stopping me, I don't think I'll ever be coming back. Unless you want terrible, slow, rude employees to wait on you, hair in your food, and over priced delicious food and beer come here."}
{"text":"Horrible service time after time after time. I'd like to say it adds to the charm but it just doesnt. The staff isn't rude or anything. They just have a habit of looking right through you. And if you want silverware to accompany your meal well forget it. Still, we come back week after week after week because they really do have an awesome assortment of beer and who can resist the Tuesday tv dinners?!?"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Food came out quickly and delicious. The bartenders were awesome, polite, and attentive. Second time here and it definitely won't be the last."}
{"text":"Beeeeerrr. This is beer heaven. They have a huge chalk board with all the different beer choices listed. You can also get flights and choose 6, but you can ask your server to fill it out if you have no idea what to order like me haha. The IPAs are really good and strong. The food is tasty and pairs perfect with the beer. The only problem is the service is sooooo slow, I get that it's really busy but we had to wait way too long I between seeing our server on more than one visit! Still staff is friendly, drinks are incredible and the people are a good mix."}
{"text":"The food is decent, the beer list is fun, and the bartenders are knowledgeable. However, I've never encountered a more rude or unwelcoming wait staff. I won't be returning here unless obligated, because of the horrible service."}
{"text":"Having been here a handful of times, I think I have a decent handle on it.  -On the positive side, the beer selection is immense, and fresh.  If you like beer, you'll love what's available here.  The food selection is unexpected, and unexpectedly good.   The fries are a hit, the flatbreads are great, the variety of quirky or unexpected takes on what I'll call Suburban Kid Soul Food are creative, fun, and delicious.  That said, I particularly like the hummus because it has a bigger sesame hit than any I've ever had, and I like that.  I'd give the place 4 stars easy for these points alone.    However...  - On the negative side.  Parking is almost nonexistent.  The place closes at midnight even on weekends.  And the staff has some standout nice and helpful folks, but balances out overall at somewhat aloof, dragged down by the likes of Tessa, she of the bitchy body language and poorly hidden eye-rolling.   Net/net, the place is entertaining, but seems kind of clubby, and if you're not in the club, your presence will merely be accomodated.  Maybe even with a smile.  But you're taking up space that could otherwise be used by club members...whoever they are."}
{"text":"Angel's does a nice job of being a solid beer bar & dinner spot. The food is good, to the point and well made. The menu has a nice variety and pairs well with the beers.   The beers on tap are diverse for all types of beer drinkers. The place is spacious, the staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and the pricing is very reasonable.    Even though the place isnt very comfy and the decor is cold and uninviting, I can still see myself coming here pretty often. The beer selection, food, vibe, and staff are really good."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on Saturday and was quite surprised by the variety of beer.  Our waitress Betsy explained their system to us.  We ordered some unique beers that we had never had before and some super tasty food.  Service was very good and the vibe was cool.  We really enjoyed this place and will definitely be back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Food was a nice twist for bar food. Wings are unique and tasty. Matador brisket sandwich was very good. Fries were good as well. Nice variety of beer offerings. Decent prices. Staff was very friendly. The service is excellent. Very close to downtown Phoenix and hotels. Great place to grab a beer."}
{"text":"All around best experience I've had in a very long time. This is a real brew house. When I was there, they had 26 beers on tap. I told the bar keeper, I was a little bit unsure about dark beers so he was gentle--suggested \"Blacked Out IPA\"--excellent choice! Overall service was a 5 stars. Did not come for the food but holy buckets was the \"Guppy\" delicious. This was basically fish tacos, but so much better! I was going to say I would come back for the beer, then thought I'd say I'd come back for the service, but oh yea I'd come back for the food. Great experience. Don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"I have visited twice. I loved it the first time. Second time was a disaster. Lunch time on a weekend, the place was slammed inside, but had plenty of space on the patio. After 45 minutes of waiting, we decided to leave. I stopped the bus boy 3 times and asked for them to mention to the server we were ready to order drinks and food. I stopped two other servers who said we weren't in their area, and they would get the person who's zone we were in. She appeared once or twice, quickly running to other tables, while ignoring ours. I can't say I am interested in returning after wasting a trip. There appeared to be some sort of event that that bar was aware of, that they completely failed to adequately staff for (a mid day pub crawl type of thing). I watched a couple of other groups walk out as well. They lost a lot of business that day."}
{"text":"First time here, and called to notify the owners that we had a large group coming on a Sat for a birthday party. The owners greeted us upon arrival and saved a spot for us, let us bring a cake, and accommodated about 25-30 of our guests on a busy night.   Lots of local beers on tap, great food options, and Micah, our server, did an awesome job. He was on it, attentive, and all our guests commented on how great the server was.  Only gripes, parking is a bit tricky, as is any spot in downtown, or along that central corridor. The seating where we were, back, right, next to the windows were a bit hot. It was humid and we were in the sun. But other than that, we had an awesome time. We will definitely be back to try more beers.  Ask for Micah, he rocks!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were downtown riding the light rail looking for apartments. We were looking for a place within walking distance of the light rail because it was hot. It was a five or ten minute walk of the stop. It looks a little uninviting from the outside.. Took a minute to find the door.. But once we got it it was really cool. They had a lot of beers on tap - we don't drink - but they had a wide selection. The food was awesome. I got a bacon burger and she got the grilled cheese. The grilled cheese had honey on it , which sounds weird, but she raved about it. It had a hipster sort of feel. They make their own pop tarts which sounded cool but they only had peanut butter and due to an allergy would work. But overall, we'd go back. Maybe once we move downtown!"}
{"text":"Excellent fried chicken sandwich and the chocolate peanut butter porter was amazing. (Achockolypse)."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. I like the rotating selection of beers, but lately my favorite brews tend to be more fruity beers. I loved the Peche Mel Brasserie dubuisson freres Belgium. They do flights in small glasses in muffin tins. Cute idea. I also tried a sandwich and french fries. Gotta have the fries! Am I right? Anywhere I go, I have to test them! So they fries passed the Lizzle test, they are garlicky and come with house ketchup- it's zesty and I love it! I also think the patio would be a stellar location for some winter fire pit relaxing. Just sayin!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when looking for something somewhat near the Airport. Food was amazing and not your usual run of the mill menu. I'd recommend the Casper pizza. Beer selection is incredible too. Great outside seating area with a cool hipster vibe. I'd eat here whenever I am in this area."}
{"text":"Really fun, cool environment with well educated staff who can be testy at times but are generally good natured and will spend the time if they have it. Coffee shop environment and a good place to hang with a couple friends."}
{"text":"Spam!  They have Spam! Yeah that compressed, salty, meat from a can.     Ok, ok...I realized I may be the only one excited about this, ESPECIALLY since they are known for their FABULOUS rotating beer selection, 30+ on tap at any one time.  They also offer some wines on tap as well.  Order up a flight or 2 (6 tasters of  your choosing of any of the listed beers) and expand your beer palate or go for a pint of your favorite. Their menu is quite complementary to their beer offerings.   Ok, now back to the Spam.  Now trust me on this,  when Spam is done right it can be quite tasty.  They do it very well here.  Their Spam Sliders, as a meal if you enjoy Spam as much as I do, or nicely shared.  It is fried to crisp perfection and served on toasted Hawaiian bread  with a Sriracha mayo coleslaw.   My other Spammy favorite is a Sammy, the Churchill Grilled Cheese, you pay a lil extra for the crispy fried Spam goodness (or bacon, you really can't go wrong here) but it goes so well with the melty deliciousness of smoked mozzarella and fontina cheese.    You have to come and check out their Tuesday TV dinner meal.  A TV dinner like compartment tray comes to you filled with yummies that vary every week (Main dish, side or 2, and a dessert). These are not Hungry Man meals  but you won't leave hungry.   Make sure to follow them on Facebook to see what they are serving up that Tuesday and get there early because it has been know to be a sell out option.     I love this place, but, \"Why only 4 stars?\", you ask.  Well, it gets quite loud in the main restaurant area.  Every sound kind of carries and you spend your time speaking loudly to have a conversation.  So when the weather is good I like the patio mostly because the noise issue does not carry-over to the patio.    Always, check their Facebook for fun and educational events and \"classes\".  I recently attended a \"Cider School\" here on a weekend before they opened for business that day.  In attendance were Woodchuck and J.K. Scrumpy brewers/reps.  We tasted 6 types of apples commonly used in cider making. Tasted several ciders, including some that were not even on the market  yet. Oh don't let me forget the food pairing.  The most fun I have had in a long time.  [That event itself was a 10 out of 5 stars, LOVED IT]"}
{"text":"Service is leisurely, but beer selection is well curated and food is top notch  bar food.  Patio is great on warm evenings.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great place to get some awesome beers. I always have fun picking out the flight combination of the night. I realized that I'm a \"save the best for last\" kinda guy! The food is really good too. But I wouldn't bank on getting in for dinner during peak times...I probably wouldn't even want to with how busy it gets."}
{"text":"This is a great bar and place to go with friends. The flights are wonderful and they display the beers in a fun way on the chalk board. My favorite thing I have eaten here was the spaghetti and meatball pizza. I do not see it on the menu online, so it may been a special. Either way it was delicious. Love the vibe and the simply scrumptious food."}
{"text":"Holy COW!!!  I'm back here  at Angels Trumpet Ale House 4 days later for TV dinner night!!   I also was able to order the Cookies and Cream Pop Tart which was the daily flavor!! Wow talk about phenomenal. Pop tart ordering will become a standard on all trips!!   The $8 TV dinner is so worth it. Tonight was Campfire Mac and Cheese with Beanie Weenie Chili, spinach salad, spicy Fritos, jalapeño corn bread and a s'mores for dessert.  For $8 you can't beat the the complete meal.  Can't wait to try other Tuesday TV dinners!"}
{"text":"Angles Trumpet Ale House is what every bar should be like. If i had this place anywhere close to me i would be a hardcore regular.   Parking: Only bad part, small lot and metered parking on the street  Decor: Awesome modern decor with a full indoor outdoor area. The whole place opens up and mesh's awesomely. At least in the spring/fall/winter. Might be crazy hot in the summer  Service: They have a lot of people working there who are all very knowledgeable of their crafts beer and in love with their food  FOOD: I don't want to sound like a white girl but OMG. Everything was just stupid stupid good.             Fish Tacos: They are just dummy good. The amount of fish you get in these things are just stupid good. Every bite was a little bit of heaven. By far the best battered fish tacos I've every had. Cabbage mix, beans, crumbled cheese, uhhhh falling in love again just thinking about it             Burgers: All the patties are delicious. The buns work perfectly with all the additions they put on them. If you love egg on everything like I do, just get any burger and add an egg. It's so good!!!            POP TART: This made me reevaluate my life of desserts. Seriously the flakyness, barryness, sugarness. Just every part of what they got in that thing is crazy good.     Just go, don't think about it!!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were in town and stumbled upon this place.  We actually wanted to try it out because we saw fellow Yelpers mention TV dinners, however when we got there it was only served on Tuesdays.  Bummer.      There was a football game on so many of us were loud and screaming due to the game, but I'm not sure what the atmosphere is like on a regular day.   This place reminds me of a bar you would see in downtown Vegas.  Being a gastropub, they have tons of beers on tap to choose from.  You can also buy beer in a can and take it home in a brown paper bag.  Super classy hahah     Food.  To be honest, the food was just ok, we ordered pizza and burger, but my four stars goes just to the desserts !!! homemade warm poptarts and warm salted caramel chocolate cookies topped with ice cream ...  I guess they change up the flavors of the poptarts so make sure you ask what the filling is.    If you want to try this place out .. I would recommend to skip the meal and go straight for the dessert !"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. The food is fantastic, the beer selection is incredible, and the atmosphere lively but not overwhelming."}
{"text":"Perfect patio for friends or families with babies and dogs!! And Big Guppy Fish tacos are the best!!"}
{"text":"The food is just ok.  The beer was so fun to drink and the staff is really helpful in suggesting what to try.  Will come back here!"}
{"text":"Burrito is super dry. And served with fried pig skins! Yuck. Also ordered the fall special shrimp flat bread and it was OK.  Beers are great ordered the Keller Weiss and blonde d orange and both were very nice.  Service good."}
{"text":"I was not a particular fan of this place. Went on a Friday evening after work. A friend wanted to try it because we always enjoy supporting new, local places.  They do have a very large selections of beer but the process is very confusing. All of the beers on tap are written on a very large chalkboard above the bar. They use several different colors of chalk for each selection making it very hard to read. It may be easier if they pick one color of chalk for each type of beer, that way it is easy to find what you want. Or have #1-5 be one type of beer, #6-10 another and so on. My boyfriend spent so long trying to find a beer on the board because of this. Two of our friends were so overwhelmed with the way the selections were presented they just asked the server to surprise them with a choice.   The acoustics in the place are terrible. It was so loud inside that it was hard to carry on a conversation at the table.   Also, no happy hour. This would be a great way to draw in an after work crowd."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection of beer and wine and a few ciders! If you are an avid beer drinker you definitely want to check it out, the food is always pretty good too. Long bar and lots of tables for dates or groups of friends to gather at. A neat place to begin your night at for sure, not the most popping place but perfect to grab a beer BEFORE heading to a concert, event or bar crawl. Would recommend t check thus place out, right across the street from Film bar and Cobra Arcade if you are looking for a fun night."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Although, it is a bit loud inside, they have a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service and a huge selection of IPA what more could you ask for ? The atmosphere is very cool I came here with my husband and our two young kids. The only reason I couldn't give a 5 Star is because no official kids menu which I knew before we came so I just packed my picky toddlers pb&j's. If they would have or will eat some chicken tenders and fries it would have been perfect. We live in scottsdale and where on our way to the circus and so happy we found this place we will make the trip down here again it was so good!!!! I highly recommend the Outlaw burger they where kind and where very accommodating for my request of no bun and places it on some lettuce it was cooked perfect and the flavors where amazing , my husband ordered the fried chicken sandwich which he said was very good. He's a bit of a beer snob and was very happy to see the great beer selection. Hope they open one closer they would do amazing in N. Scottsdale / N.Phx area .fingers crossed"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best beer selection in downtown, and a great food menu to accompany. Service is generally very good and the staff is all friendly. Great atmosphere with a large patio that is pet friendly. Love this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always have great service and their specials constantly change.   They have a massive selection of beer and wine. I always can find something to drink.  Gets a little bit noisy at night."}
{"text":"Awesome beer bar if you love beer. Great service and great environment. Food isn't too bad either."}
{"text":"Nice selection of beer on tap but the food is mediocre at best. The pretzels were good, but how do you mess up a pretzel? The outlaw burger was good in concept, but \"medium well\", does not mean \"well\" and the fries were soggy. I will come back for the beer, but will skip the burger and opt for a flatbread pizza instead."}
{"text":"A great beer selection, with knowledgeable servers.  The food is a bit strange, but not bad at all.  I have been here now 4 times and will happily be going again.  I'm always in the hunt for places that serve beers I've never had, which is rare, and I always manage to find a few here!"}
{"text":"Love their burgers! Beer is also great. Can't say much else about the food because ever since I got a burger on my first visit, I haven't been able to get anything else on the following visits!"}
{"text":"Headed out on date night with friends and decided to try This place for dinner based on the pictures on Yelp. Anytime my husband can get a good burger and good beer he is happy. They have a super small parking lot so you will most likely need to park on the street. We were kind of early so there was plenty of parking around when we arrived but it had filled up by the time we left.  There is a huge board behind the bar that lists all of the beers available. While we were there they erased and replaces at least two that I saw so if you see something you want order it! We tried a flight of beers so we could sample multiple. They have a good variety.  My husband had the Outlaw Burger and enjoyed it. I had the BBQ grilled cheese which was very tasty. The fries were also really good. My friend had the Fun-guy flatbread which was also very good.  Even though we were on the full side we decided to split some desert. We ordered the Blueberry pop tart and the salted chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. The pop tart was amazing! Definitely a must order. The cookie was too sweet for me but the guys loved it.  Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was great. Although kind of loud and crowded the wings are fantastic"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Amazing beer.  Great vibe.  There is nothing not to love!"}
{"text":"Rotating taps. $9 flights. Best pretzel bun in town. I've never left unsatisfied. If I had to complain, it gets super loud in here."}
{"text":"Overall I like this place.  Great and ever changing selection of beer.  Food is pretty awesome. The wait staff are nice, and pretty attentive.  Parking sucks, but that is typical of downtown Phoenix.   Decidedly for the 20-early 30 something crowd.  Does get pretty noisy,  and when busy you can't hear yourself think let alone talk to the person next to you, as a beer hall should.  Sort of hipsterish.    I'd recommend Angel's Trumpet."}
{"text":"The beer selection is always great and the food is surprisingly good. They make a great homemade pop tart which used to be a blueberry but right now it's lemon,  still good though."}
{"text":"This place is great.  We tried to go to Matt's Big Breakfast but the line was out the door and it was a huge wait.  I'm so glad we came here instead.  I had some burger with bacon and eggs on it.  It was very juicy and delcious.  It was a little early for beer for me, but I would like to come back here and try some of the beers they have.  This is a huge building that looks completely remodeled on the inside.  It appears they have a very large patio in the back as well.  If you live in the area I bet this place is packed on Friday and Saturday nights.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. If my future experiences are anything like my experience last night, this place would be a definite five star. I went with the BF and a couple of friends and we were seated right away (around 9 ish). The bar was hopping. Our server knew a lot about beer and we each gave him a description of what we liked and he picked beer for us. It was awesome! He clearly likes his job and is very good at it. They also have a neat way of doing flights, they have a piece of paper with 6 circles on it. You put the number of the beer you want to try in each circle (and there are like 30+ choices.....ah mazing!). They bring out the six fairly large sample sizes in a muffin tin (cute idea!). We got two flights and tried some crazy beers...a lot of beers none of us had ever tried before. It was also cool that the beers were changing throughout the night...like when one keg ran out, they replaced it with something totally new. We didn't have any food, but it smelled and looked good. The ambiance is comfortable...they have an open wall out to the outside and tables throughout. It is a large bar and has plenty of seating. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was date night with the bf and I've been wanting to try this place out.   I didn't know what to anticipate and it was not what I expected at all. It was about a 30 minute wait for a table on a Friday night that we went. I ordered the Spam sliders and some Nitro chocolate beer that they had on tap. The sliders were good but very messy. I didn't like my beer since it was too thick for me and tasted a bit bitter.   I was a bit disappointed in this place. First, it wasn't hard to find, however they have a tiny parking lot so you will most likely have to look for street parking. I think that it's great that they have over 31 beers on tap, however they have this huge chalk board that they just write everything on. There's no menu with their beers on there. I already have bad vision so I would have to get up and go up there every time I wanted to look at their menu.  If you sit in the inside it's extremely loud. I couldn't hear anything my boyfriend was saying. Their website doesn't even have their food menu or anything on there so I can't really even describe my meal or explain to you what my boyfriend ordered.   The service was really good. However, I probably wouldn't come for dinner. I'd probably come for maybe a drink on their patio."}
{"text":"After my flight arrived at PHX I randomly selected this place to plop down for a couple hours while I waitED for my daughter to get off work.  After my Uber driver dropped me off I realized on entering the front door that I have been here before, over a year ago, and loved it!  The Hop Chowda IPA went well with the Big Guppy tacos.  Nice casual vibe to the place.  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Angels trumpet offers a great combination of excellent beer, great food and an inviting atmosphere. The also have half a dozen taps of draft wine. It may be a bit noisy inside, you can always sit out in the patio. Should you desire beer to go; no worries, they offer \"Crowlers\"."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Great atmosphere and TONS of beer on tap!  One of my favorites in the city!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and place to enjoy some really great beers on tap.  Every single beer I tasted (out of 7) was delicious.  Even non beer drinkers would have no complaints.    My fav: wings & left coast watermelon wheat-- def gave hell or high watermelon a solid competitor."}
{"text":"What? I'm Sorry... excuse me? What!?!  I can't hear a word you are saying. That's basically the theme of the night so be warned. This is my fifth visit to Angels Trumpet House for the fantastic beer selection. I usually don't review on first visit because my opinion might change and I believe a review should be on average. Every establishment has their on nights and off nights. The 31 tab beer selection is outstanding if you are a beer drinker and not looking for the run of the mill domestic beer. The food is interesting I had the chorizo and polish sausage appetizer. Not great but not horrible either. The acoustics of the place are kind of a nightmare, it is truly deafening and very difficult to carry on a conversation with someone right next to you. If they are across the table-game over! It's definitely more of a Phoenix winter place so you can sit out on the patio and not suffer from tinnitus by the end of the night. So if you and your buddy love a great beer selection and don't have much to talk about this place is for you!"}
{"text":"What a gem!  The food was great and the beer selection was magnificent.  The staff was highly educated on beer their beer selections.  Atmosphere was great and there is some good people watching.  It's a must do if you haven't been there and it's kid friendly."}
{"text":"Found this place a few months ago and it's quite a gem.  They have different beers and a small wine selection to try.  The food is also good with a slight twist in the burgers and pizzas.  I like that you can come anytime during the week just to grab a cold one.  The staff is super friendly and always have good suggestions for the food as well as beer (because we all have different beer tastes).   The prices for the flights are good (to me)  considering what you get for the price.  I like the ambiance and chill factor this place and come here often when I'm in the mood to just relax and grab a beer."}
{"text":"Is it really possible that I've not written a review for ATAH? Apparently so and its LONG overdue.   I've probably been into Angel's about 20 times over the past few years, attending their Anniversary parties, Beer Week Events, Tuesday TV dinner nights and, most importantly, as a pre-and post-game ritual before Dbacks games. This year I got myself a mini-season ticket package so have been in about 5 times in the past couple months.   This is THE beer bar in downtown. The selection is awesome, I always go for a flight because the pints can be a bit pricey but the flights are always $9 unless they have a rare beer on that's not flight-eligible. The food is incredible here, from the pizzas to the burgers to the salads and of course the homemade pop tarts. The staff can be hit and miss, but, if you sit at the bar you're pretty much guaranteed an awesome conversation with a top-notch bartender. Sam has been working the last few times I was in and is a great beer-fan to talk to get recommendations from, but every bartender has always been really good there.   Downsides, hmmm...well its very loud in there at times, super noisy building. Oh, and they close at 12, which is a bummer if your game went extra innings and you were ready to drink up a few rounds of awesome beer afterwards. But, they don't serve liquor, so I get it -can always head across the street. Really though, this place rocks. Come in, sit at the bar, get a flight and enjoy the awesomeness yourself. You'll be glad you did, Cheers!"}
{"text":"Visited with a group of about 8 and everything looked great! Crazy selection of beers! Definitely would go again. Sorry for lack of details but it's been a while. I'm a bit behind with yelping!"}
{"text":"Food, beer, ambiance and service was great!!! Locally owned and operated and the passion shines through in everything they do. We had the spam sliders for an app and omg i have thought about them every day since we had them! (They are that good) For dinner we shared the peanut butter and bacon sandwich with mellow fluff and preserves, all of which was homemade. It was all sorts of ooey gooey deliciousness!   PROPS TO THE CHEF who clearly knows what he is doing. You know a chef  has passion and truly cares when he is out  and about doing table visits.  Also the downtown view from the patio is beautiful.  All and all i can not wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It's taken me a while to write this review because I didn't want to write it seething mad.   However, its been three months and the experience is still on my mind so I have to get it off my chest.    I was so excited to take our close friends and family to Angels Trumpet to celebrate my husband's graduation.  Angels is a local spot, and since we were downtown residents I wanted to make sure we took them to a special place.  Some of our guests had never eat there and it had been on their \"must visit\" list for a while.  After my husband's graduation ceremony we made our way to Angels.  We were taking a group of 9 people to celebrate his day.    We ordered our food and everything was fine until my dad tried his food.  He took a few bites out of one of the chicken legs and was turned off.  He asked my father in law next sitting to him to take a bite out of another leg and my father in law was turned off as well.  I didn't try it, but if it was enough for both these men to not want to take another bite, I decided to notify our waiter and hopefully exchange it for something else or maybe just take it back to the kitchen in case it wasn't cooked correctly.    The waiter seemed fine at first, but then when he went to consult management he came back with a much different attitude.  He came back very snarky and patronizing because two of the legs were bitten into.  He said that since they had eaten \"half\" of the order that they couldn't do anything about it.  Okay, back up for a moment.  My dad took a bite and then my father in law took a bite of another leg to see if the taste was just my dad's dislike or if the chicken was really bad.  It's NOT like my dad ate half his plate and decided he was full and wanted to get a free out of it.    My dad is a little more passive than I.  He didn't want to make it a big deal so he placed another order for a different dish.  I was seething!!!!!!  My dad basically gave his place double his business because his first dish was awful.  This waiter was going to make us pay for the awful chicken, and had the nerve to get offended that my dad didn't like the chicken.  It was as if this waiter was the one who cooked the chicken.  Really guy???!!  We were a large group and, no doubt, we were going to be faced with a hefty bill.  The least they could have done was not give us a flipping attitude.  I decided to look for the manager.  Turns out it was the bartender.  He told me the same thing the waiter told me.  So at this point, it makes sense.  The waiter is just relaying same awful attitude and terrible customer service as his boss.  In the end, they offered to just let us pay half of the cost of the chicken plate.  What a headache and we still paid for half the chicken even though we didn't eat half!!  Look, I don't want to split hairs on what they should have done or what is considered good customer service.  But the attitudes of the manager and the waiter were absolutely unacceptable.  Thats what made it such a bad experience.  Sure one of the dishes was bad, but if they just apologized or did something nice everything would have been fine.  I felt bad for our party because we were there to have a great time and Angels' staff was less than accommodating.  This restaurant is STINGY, rude, and I don't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Great destination for craft beer aficionados or anybody wanting to try new brews. To compliment ~30 of  the finest (and rarest) handles around, the kitchen is putting out great food. Great patio and good service as well. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Angels Trumpet is my favorite place. Period. We are extremely fortunate to have an ale house of this caliber anywhere in Arizona, and I am so happy they chose downtown to call home.   Where to begin...? The beer!!! 31 rotating taps and a killer bottle list mean that they have something for everyone. The staff are unpretentious and very knowledgeable so if you're not sure where to begin just ask.   The design and furnishings are very well thought out. The food is dynamite and they run all sorts of delicious specials. The mural on the south wall is totally rad. The view of the skyline from the back patio any time of the day is unparalleled.   So yeah. Favorite place. Anywhere. Hope they experience grand success for many years."}
{"text":"Such a fun pub to head to. Had a really great recommendation of beers. I had a nitro pale ale, delicious. My friend and I split the mess(poutine) and I had the pretzels and he had the sausage platter. The food was delicious. Very much a cool gastropub environment. The parking is a little hit or miss. The spots on the property are a one way parking, but there are plenty of parking spots on the street as well as metered spots. I would definitely recommend it and return. I would love to visit on a Tuesday, they have a \"tv dinner\" special. Would LOVE to try that out!"}
{"text":"Wish I lived closer, great place for good beer."}
{"text":"I love this place!!    Excellent service from a busy, yet friendly waitress.  We ordered a sausage/onion pizza that was on special.  The mess, which is fries, gravy, and cheese curds.  Both of these where large portions, and yummy.  The best part however, was the homemade pop-tart...blueberry!  Not overly sweet, just perfect!   We didn't get any beer, as we were driving back home from Tucson.  The do have a large selection, and good variety for all tastes.    I can't wait to go back and spend an evening."}
{"text":"When thinking about writing my review, I was going to give them 2 or 3 stars... only because THE BEER HERE IS AMAZING. I've been here 5 times now and have loved every beer I've tried. If you're a beer lover, you can't go wrong here. Great selection/variety for anyone!  I mean, 31 craft DRAFT beers in one place in DT PHX... done and done! Even if you're not a beer aficionado, tell your server what you like and they'll make suggestions as to what you should try, AND are always spot-on. Last time I was there I had the Stone Enjoy By IPA... one of my new favorite beers of all time.  Now of the 5 times here, 2 times my party has ordered food. The first time I did not like my sandwich at all, and my husband thought his was okay.  I liked the names and ideas but felt it was executed poorly.   The second time here we started at one table with a handful of people and had Jake as our server (we've had him in other DT PHX restaurants and he rocks -- as always). Jake is great, friendly, knowledgeable, quick, honest... just an all around awesome guy. Then our party grew and we cashed out and took a table outside. It got busy, we got ignored for the better part of half an hour -- but then when we finally saw our new server he was very attentive going forward. Our food was delayed and we felt there was a lack of HONEST communication. Honest meaning don't tell me the food is coming right now then come out another 40 minutes later and tell me the same thing, just tell me how it is. Our server finally got a manager involved (Waylan - sp?) and let me tell you, he was our saving grace. He communicated the issue and was quick to fix it. It was to the point that we were talking about never going in again and he changed our minds. Our food came out after he got involved, it was great, everyone was super attentive to us (we weren't looking to be babied, that's now how I roll).  I know it's frustrating when something goes wrong and you don't have much control over it but you as a manager/server get the brunt of the angry guests.  So over all, my experience at this place has went from meh, to oh no never again, to great, thanks to the customer service provided by the management team. We'll be in again soon for a delicious beer  or five, and I will give Waylan a high five when I see him, and we'll ask to sit in Jake's section. :)"}
{"text":"Totally different than I thought it was going to be- thought it would be a biker type/dive place.  Super cool- bright- good feel.  Had drinks and a vegetarian flatbread which was GREAT!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers, good food and plenty of smiles from the staff. Oh and good prices too!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, beer selection and the food options seem insanely good. I eyed about four or five different dishes that I wanted to order which is rare for me when I go out.   I ended up getting a grilled chicken sandwich that came with BBQ sauce, cheese, bacon and onion straws. Everything tasted great and the portions were generous. The french fries were killer! They serve the food with their own homemade ketchup which is something I hadn't experienced at a restaurant before.  They offer a beer flight which is always a must if the place offers it. Another plus, their beer selection is constantly rotating. While we were sitting there, they had at least four beers change from their menu.   I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Gotta love the chalkboard beer menu. Excellent & diverse selection (~25) beyond the normal craft and imports.  They turned over four kegs and posted new beers in the time we were there.   The servers were attentive and the clientele was diverse and friendly. Biggest surprise? The food was very good. Interesting, but limited selection of sandwiches and pizza flat bread. Both sandwiches we tried were excellent -  good enough to go back for even if it wasn't an awesome beer destination."}
{"text":"They have a great beer selection and that is about it. The food is an afterthought and they are reaching too far, whoever came up with the menu must be a high hipster trying to copy every other hip places food menu in the area but without the culinary chops to back it up. The service is usually pretty good and most the staff is really knowledgeable about the beer. So maybe if your looking to drink a ton of different great beers and your not looking for a great food experience this is the place for you. Plus they have a cool machine that will can anything on tap for you. It's at least worth a try."}
{"text":"TV dinner was delicious (buffalo mac & cheese!) and the beer flight was perfect. They had tons of selections to choose from and the environment was lively with a fairly young, hip crowd. Service was a tad slow on a Tuesday night, but the place was packed!"}
{"text":"Don't let my 3 stars fool you.....I am actually a pretty big fan of this place and look forward to returning. I have been twice but the experiences were different, hence the 3 stars. The first time I went with my husband and we were seated at one of the community tables. They asked us if we were okay with that and it is was fine. The more the merrier! I had a glass of their rose wine and ordered their salad that came with avocados, grapefruit, beets, mint, arugula, goat cheese, and a orange vinaigrette. I asked them to leave off the grapefruit, beets, and add salami. I thoroughly enjoyed it, wow! However, the second time I had it, I ordered it the exact same way (but for take-out instead), and when I ate it, it was way too tart. I could barely eat it which stunk because I was really looking forward to having it again. Other than that, i liked the environment. It is really chill, I loved all of the windows which brought alot of light into the restaurant. I will definitely go back especially since it has become a fave among my husband and friends."}
{"text":"If the Branch Davidians were into craft beer, this is where they'd pray. Mustachioed hipster beer  cultists mingle with business suit clad professionals in search of a great brew.   Very beer-knowledgable staff with top notch bar fare that will not make you feel guilty in the morning makes this gem a must-do for microbrew enthusiasts. Portions are generous and not overtly greasy as is typical of such a spot. Atmosphere is apropos for a beer-centric joint, but don't hesitate to being the family during daylight hours.   Amazing selection of crafts.  Indoor and outdoor seating, you could stay here for a meal, or begin and end your night hours later in bliss."}
{"text":"Wld give 0 stars if i could.  Had the worst service at Angel's Trumpet tonight. Thought we would keep supporting local and have been going there for 3 years now but the behavior tonight was unacceptable. Never going there again!! I've been a server before and to hv a manager and server behave the way they did tonight is unbelievable! ! All we asked was to switch out a beer that we didn't like (after not being offered a Taster) and even offered to pay for for the replacement but the server said \"no\" and so did the manager after asking to speak with him. It was \"against policy\"... what happened to satisfying the customers  in the service industry? We ordered dessert - the poptarts and after all the ruckus back and forth we lost our appetite and didn't even eat the dessert nor drank the beer that I wanted to return.  But yet was charged for both. I was told there's a policy on the menu that says you cannot exchange drinks.  Which I thought was ridiculous especially after not being offered a taster. All in all it was just wrong because the manager could have replaced the drink and just said moving forward, \" now you know our policy\" but nope, he charged us for both items and that resulted in the server not even getting a tip. Very disappointed.  Shocked and will never recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of beers, 25+ beers on tap. Very good food, phenomenal buffalo wings and I know my wings; dry rubbed and fried crispy with amazing sauces."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere, what was upsetting was their small happy hour options. Not what I expected"}
{"text":"Beer selection is is really kick-@$$, 3 stars is for mediocre service and long waits. But the beer selection and knowledgeable staff make it worthwhile."}
{"text":"Every time people from outside of Phoenix see pictures I post of Angels' TV dinners (only served Tuesday nights), they are astounded that that much food only costs $7. As my visiting NYC friend said, it's practically free _ or at least a killer bargain. It is a little bit like Christmas morning when you look and see on Facebook what Chef Brian will be serving for TV dinner. Past entrees have included fried chicken, meatloaf sandwich, pulled pork sandwich and chicken skewers. They always come with sides (thank god there's only enough to fill those little TV tray compartments) and a dessert.   I would already be a fan of Angels without the creative TV dinner nights. Even though I don't drink, the atmosphere here is fun, lively and so not pretentious. And it's always fun to people-watch. I used to think it was dominated by hipsters but I see white-collar office workers, men showing up in a bowtie and jacket look like possibly an ASU professor. It's very rare that you encounter someone crazy boozy. Also, the patio is a treat. They turn on the misters in the summer and they have a board out there as well with what's on tap.   The comfort food on the regular menu is amazing as well, the pizza and the sandwiches (you have to have at least once the nutter--peanut butter on sourdough with raspberry chipotle jam and marshmallow fluff and for an extra $1, peppered bacon). They also have big, fried spud tacos with sweet potatoes. A little too spicy for me but otherwise delicious. My only beef (or should I say pork?) is why on Earth would you serve spam sliders? I tried one on opening night and I could barely make it through half. Not worth the skyrocketing sodium levels. For the desserts, the \"pizza\" with marshmallow, pretzels and chocolate is so-so. But the housemade poptarts, I could inhale. A definite treat worth getting!  This has become one of my go-to spots for visitors or if I feel like I deserve a treat for the week. It's one of the best gastropub-restaurants to happen to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Parking is tough in the small lot, but there are plenty of meters around the area.  I met friends for happy hour there.  Happy hour prices wound up being over $15 for two beers.  The service was slow.    Despite the issues, I still gave a $2 tip, which I thought was more than fair for 2 beers delivered slowly.  The total bill was $17.21.  It appeared on my credit card statement as $22.21.  There is no way that they could mistake 17 for 22 and no way a $7 tip on 2 beers delivered slowly is appropriate.  I filed a chargeback and won naturally, but if you go here, pay in cash.  Otherwise, they will add to the bill to see if you catch it and maintained your customer copy."}
{"text":"So my buddy and I had a craving for some brew. Maybe some good eats as well. So, I took to yelp and this was what was presented to me. Pretty cool looking place with a beer menu board to keep your eyes wide open . So many choices, one set of kidneys . Since it was our first time, I chose to order \"The Flight\" which is a beer sampler. My choices were pretty good. To add to the flavors, we both decided to order the Spam Grilled Cheese Sandwich. Was to die for!!!! Who knew the taste of spam in a grilled cheese would be heavenly? Haven't had spam in decades. Will definitely be back to try some more."}
{"text":"Items ordered The CENTRAL: fried chicken sandwich Review: simple, executed well. Crispy and light batter. The sandwich toppings were perfect cheese, bacon, lettuce, onions, and cucumbers. It all jived.  Poptarts: the dough!  That was amazing. The filling was way too sweet. It was sort of weird. I couldn't figure it out? Maple cinnamon pecan?  Service was slow and tge waiter only came 2 times.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"The food is pretty meh. It sounds good, looks good, but just doesn't deliver. I was excited to try the smoked pork burger but the patty was small and dry. The house made ketchup served with french fries tastes like marinara sauce. They do not have regular ketchup. The flatbread pizza with goat cheese was on the salty side and the goat cheese was not creamy, but more like feta.   The rotating beer selection is great but when I got the sampler last night 3 out of the 6 beers were not very good.   Great place to go before heading over to FilmBar but I wouldn't purposefully come here for the food."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING! I have to stop in when I can have a beer (or two), 'cause the selection is beyond anything you typically see in PHX. This will continue to be a \"let's grab lunch\" spot, regardless of my ability to imbibe (or not)."}
{"text":"This busy, bustling gastro-pub makes for a fun night out.  Cool, open decor inside with a long chalkboard displaying a tempting list of great craft beers.  Part of the fun of drinking and dining here is anxiously watching as one of the staff removes one beer from the list and replaces it with a new one.    And the food -- so good.  I had the wings and pretzels (just appetizers for me this time) but the burgers, sandwiches and pizza my coworkers had looked good too.  The wings were seasoned and flavorful, cooked perfectly and served with a unique chunky buffalo sauce, an awesome chutney and perhaps a ranch or tzatziki sauce (I wasn't a huge fan of this last one except for dipping the accompanying carrots and celery). The pretzels, though awesome, served mainly as a delivery device for the savory and delicious beer cheese sauce.   Lastly, don't pass up on the homemade pop tart!  Our table split one order and it took a lot of willpower for us all to avoid buying individual ones for ourselves.  That night they served apple cinnamon ones.  They were more like toaster strudels, but that's a good thing!"}
{"text":"Great place! I always get their fish tacos . My bf likes to get the spam sliders, sounds weird but they are good too!!! They have a great selection of alcohol and the ambience it just great. I take longer trying to figure out what new drink I want to try lol. The staff is really friendly and does their best to accommodate and answer any questions. They also make their own \"pop tarts\" and they are soooo good if you saved room for dessert. The only issue I have is the parking is hard to find but that can be expected given their location. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place is a great example of a casual bar/beer garden that surprises you with how good the food is. It was bumpin for a Wednesday evening, but it never got too crowded or loud or annoying. There's a ton of beers on tap, and good variety at that. And they do flights. Also, you can you watch them can crowlers behind the bar (lol the machine is fun to watch). I took a while to decide what to eat because the menu seemed ordinary and not very creative. I was so wrong, my sandwich was excellent. I got the \"good ole fashioned\" with grilled chicken and bacon. Also, the ketchup is homemade which made the fries taste even better. Literally cleaned my plate. The bartenders were super nice and attentive, too. I felt adequately tended to without constantly being bothered, or \"over-chatted\" with. Always had everything I needed and was able to just chill. Would definitely recommend. If I lived in Phoenix, I would probably come here often."}
{"text":"I love Angels, the poutine (I believe they call it The Mess), is fantastic, I actually have dreams about eating it, its that great.  We also had the chefs special which was different meats and pickled vegetables, it was also very good!  I can't wait to go back on a Tuesday and have a TV dinner and I'm still waiting to get a homemade pop tart!!  It really has something for everyone, as I don't even drink beer and absolutely love it there!!"}
{"text":"We met up with some friends recently at Angels Trumpet and had a blast!  It was packed out, but we were able to get seats at one of the shared high-top tables, which is always fun since you never know who you'll end up chatting with.  If you're on a date and looking for exclusivity, it's probably not ideal, but it's always entertaining to start chatting with your fellow diners about whether they would recommend the food they're currently shoveling down their throats in an attempt to escape your rowdiness.  There's a killer beer selection and a surprisingly good couple of wines as well.  We also devoured a set of wings (highly recommend) and the tractor pizza (eggs, bacon, brussel sprouts - weird but tasty).  We could have split a single dish, since the pizza ended up being much bigger than we expected, but we just pigged out instead.  We also tried some of the homemade poptart of the day, which sounds weird and a little gross (if you remember what poptarts usually taste like) but which was actually an incredible dessert.  Definitely recommend Angels Trumpet as a chill place to meet up for a beer or two."}
{"text":"Great Downtown choice! Killer craft beer selection and scrumptious comfort food."}
{"text":"Honestly, i was avoiding trying this place because I thought the name made it sound like something it was not.  After finally going, I am really very impressed!  The beer selection was incredible and the food just as good!  The patio is super nice and large, and as far as ambiance and decor, it doesn't get much better!  Will definitely be visiting this place again in the future."}
{"text":"When we want to get out and be around people in a casual and relaxed city atmosphere that has wonderful outdoor seating, this is our go to place! LOVE that I can get a glass of Pali on tap and the selection of beer!"}
{"text":"There's not a lot on the menu for someone who is gluten-free, vegan, or both. I'd recommend getting the fries - yum! - and the spinach/avocado salad that comes with smoked beets.   Oh, and the beer -- great list which includes local and regional craft beers you may not be able to get anywhere else, let alone on tap!"}
{"text":"If you love beer more than you love most people, Angel's Trumpet Ale House is for you. With over 20 taps of the finest craft beers, you're sure to find your perfect match. If beers aren't your thing, let me tell you about the food. It's all delicious. All of it. They make everything from scratch (and I'm talking even the ketchup), so you really can't go wrong. They serve gastropub favorites like wings, sliders and hot pretzels, but they are in no way typical. For dessert they have sea salt + chocolate chip cookies and HOME MADE POP TARTS. The proprietors are lovely people who are dedicated to bringing you the best brew and best foods. The patio is big and comfortable; bring your entire contact list. You'll be a hero."}
{"text":"Possibly the best bar in Maricopa county!  Also the food is excellent.  There are over thirty choices for beer and wine.  I often recommend this place when anyone wants to meet downtown.  There is a great patio outside and plenty of room. Sadly Ashley is no longer doing chalk art."}
{"text":"A good and varied beer selection, with affordable flights available. They also appear to have Crowlers available for takeout.  The menu is simple, with a few sandwiches, some tacos, and usually two salads and varies from day to day.  My experience with the food has always been positive. It's not gonna knock your socks off, but it's better than most casual beer pub food.  The service has always been very good to outstanding. Although the crowd is mostly on the  younger side, I've seen plenty of older folks and a few families."}
{"text":"Two Stars for Meh service! A group of 12 people came after work and the server was annoyed that we had so many people. She had an attitude and messed up my beer order 3 different times. I didn't complain the first time. But I did the second and she was visibly irritated. She didn't really care much about our business. I have been here twice and it really is just a Meh. I do like that it is dog friendly :)"}
{"text":"People cream their shorts over Trumpet Ale House...why? Maybe it's because it's the only Brewery Downtown? Who knows. Breweries are pretty ubiquitous in Tempe and they don't RUN OUT of anything. Does this make you think that the beer you're enjoying is some how more exclusive? No...it means they don't have room for extra kegs, because they took up the only available slab of real estate in the Arts District.  Also, pretty sure that grandiose sense of self, that the staff possess, has gotten passed down the patrons...  It's a place to people watch and \"been seen\". Ugh...People treat you like shit, and if they manage to crack a smile while staring in your general direction, you somehow feel like part of the club? This isn't High School...and you aren't in Mean Girls Part Deux.  Thing is? I really wanted to love this place : (  3 Stars because they serve (fantastic) food and beer downtown. Minus 1 star because they run out of shit.  Minus 1 star bc when I order a lambic, I expect the rest of the bottle. I know what I am getting when I order a Belgian Framboise. I also know ya re-corked and reused what I paid for, after you poured a meager serving into the champagne sized flute. Give me what I purchased (like every other bar does).   I'd go back for the food, and not show up on First (Fight the Pretend Art-Loving Crowd) Friday..."}
{"text":"Angels is a fun hang-out, but not among my favorites. I've never had a shockingly great food experience, even with items that would be hard not to like. (For example, I ordered their Casper flatbread the other day, which comprises salami, rosemary, leeks, goat cheese, and a drizzle of honey. Sounds intoxicatingly good, right? They layered no less than 35 slices of salami on that single flatbread, so that you can't even see the flatbread itself. On top, they crumbled a full container's worth of goat cheese--the two flavors were so overpowering that I felt nauseous for the rest of the night, had the rest for leftovers the next day, and felt nauseous all over again.)  What I CAN commend are their homemade, seasonal Poptarts. These things are to die for, particularly their pineapple IPA variety (the strawberry-banana was...meh).  Lastly, their selection of brews is top-notch for this area of downtown, and also for this level of character--although the interior is extremely crowded and loud at virtually all times (whereas their patio feels like a fenced-off parking lot in...well, the middle of downtown Phoenix), I'd take Angels' beer selection and atmosphere over the wider selection and nonexistent atmosphere at the Yard House."}
{"text":"Been here several times. Parking is limited in the parking lot for the restaurant. Plan on paying on a meter on the street. Lots of beers on tap. I don't drink so I don't have a option on the beers. The food is very good. Nice inside and outside patio seating."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place since I moved out here in October of 09', I decided enough was enough....it was time !   It's so tucked away downtown I actually drove past it.  It was about 9PM on a Wed. and inside all tables were packed.  The patio was actually great and I like that they have all drinks written on a chalkboard as opposed to using just menus. I had a red blend of wine which was really yummy, similar to a Cabernet.   The only thing I wasn't that thrilled about was their food selection.  I'm not sure why, but nothing really caught my eye.  We ordered \"the mess\" and shared between the three of us.  Brown gravy, cheese curds and fries.  They were pretty good, but I thought the gravy left little to be desired.    The thing that would keep me coming back would have to be the mellow vibe and man, I loved that patio.  I will eat before and be happy to quench my thirst on a flight of beers. :)  Want something low key, but a great atmosphere...this is it."}
{"text":"My bf and I came for a small snack and some brews. We got the pretzel and cheese appetizer. The pretzel was very tasty and I recommend It highly. We didn't try the other food, but I'm sure It is equally as appetizing. They have outdoor seating and valet parking as a plus!"}
{"text":"Love it here!  Foods is great, they have healthy options that taste fantastic.  The food even has a bit of a classy edge to it from what you would normally expect from a gastropub.  The beer selection is always many and their beer flights are awesomely priced.  They make homemade Pop Tarts... enough said!"}
{"text":"We went in there about a week after it opened and had a really bad experience there.  The beer was good, and the server we had was good, but the food was awful and the experience we had with the manager was what ultimately ruined the experience.  We ordered wings, and a quesadilla.  The wings looked and tasted either like they had been sitting out for an hour, or they were deep fried to a crisp.  The quesadilla had decent flavor, but was only about 1/8 of an inch thick and had very little filling, definitely not worth the $7 for such a small amount of food.  There are a lot of places in downtown I can go and get full for $7, this was like a 3 bite snack.    But, since we live downtown, and we like to support our local businesses, and considering the fact that they had only been open a week or so, we thought we'd give some helpful constructive feedback to the management in hopes they might improve.  So we asked to talk to a manager to tell him about the food.  So this guy comes over and we tell him the wings taste way too overdone, and the quesadilla tasted alright but was a poor value at $7.  We told him we were local, we were polite, and that we knew they had only been open a week and we  wanted to help them work out the kinks.    The manager immediately got really defensive and tried to tell us that the wings were fine (and that everyone else in the place who ordered them loved them)  and that they only use the very best ingredients and that's why the quesadilla was so expensive.  Then he basically tried to tell us that we were wrong and that there was no way that the food could have been that bad.  We were just trying to help a local place succeed, and this guy put a really bad taste in our mouth.   Arguing with a customer and trying to convince them that the bad food they just ate wasn't really bad is a perfect example of how not to run a restaurant.  All he had to do was simply say \"thank you for the honest feedback, we will consider your recommendations, and we would love it if you would come back and have a free appetizer on us so that you can see we're committed to improving.\"  We would have been back a dozen times by now, and told all our friends about it.  But instead he was a jerk.    We thought about coming back again after a few months, but every time we think about it, we just think of the manager.  And besides, there are lots of other great places in downtown Phoenix that have better, cheaper food, and good beer too.  So we haven't been back, and we probably won't ever unless something changes."}
{"text":"traveling to a city, you never know what someone elses idea of \"great local restaurant\" is - this was \"excellent\" - I am not a beer expert, but everyone else in our party was.  They loved the broad selection of styles and brands to try.  The food was awesome - our party was divided - half got burgers, half got pizza and everyone loved their selection.  When we got there they said it would be 30 minute wait, but 5 minutes later we were seated outside, enjoying the balmy weather of Phoenix.  Enjoy the brews, enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a few local Yelpers. So after arriving a day early for a business trip, my coworker and I stopped here for a few beers and a late lunch.  The place is interesting with a long bar, high top table seating as well as regular sized table seating, a mid-century modern corner seating area and a large outdoor patio with plenty of additional seating.  The beer menu is on a chalkboard above the bar. I had two dark beers while I was here which were good but I was eally craving a sour which they did not have any on tap. Oh well.  For lunch, my coworker and I both ordered the Matador sandwich which was beef covered in havarti horseradish cheese, peppers, onion and mushrooms on a pretzel bun with a side order of fries. The sandwich was great and beautifully presented. The one criticism is the pretzel roll was a bit dry. The fries were good also and the ketchup was amazing.   Really enjoyed the place and talking to our server. But still would have liked to see a sour on the beer menu. Apparently sours aren't as popular yet in Phoenix as the rest of the country."}
{"text":"Beer Stop 142 ----  Angels Trumpet was a 10 minute walk from my hotel so I decided to check it out, braving the extreme heat and all.  My first impression of the beer list wasn't all too positive. I was expecting some more local AZ breweries on the list, but rather a lot of the beers were also distributed in San Diego. Oh well. After striking up a convo with the bartender, he did provide (2) local selections - Peoria DIPA and Phoenix Pale. Both were good choices!   Moving on to food, the wife and I split the flatbread and wings. Here is where Angels Trumpet really shined! Delicious food at a reasonable price! How can you go wrong?  I really liked the layout of this place. Maybe the heat effected how I judged the taplist, but there is always time for another visit !"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour or a weekend funday. The wings are totally awesome, highly recommended. They have an excellent selection of beers too. Great location and close to a lot of other downtown establishments."}
{"text":"Listen up people. Try this place.   Two words: Burgers and Beer.  What else could you possibly ask for?  They have an almighty chalkboard with their rotating beer menu on it and it is legit.  The outlaw burger is always my go to. (Add avocado...you're welcome.)  They also have super bomb pizza as well as sandwiches and \"the mess\". (Poutine)  If you are looking to crack open some cold ones with the boys or have a GNO with some craft beer and junk food involved, Angels is the SPOT.  BB's Rating: BURGER + BEER = IN THE CLEAR"}
{"text":"Great late night spot - our last stop on a pub crawl in downtown Phoenix. Loads of terrific choices on tap and good service. We didn't have anything to eat from the menu, but would definitely visit again and try something. Clean, with a pretty hip vibe."}
{"text":"Awesome food, good beer and wine... great prices..try the desert!! ... Disgruntled waitress.. Cranky,not friendly nor a sense a humor! Great place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"We arrived for our anniversary, early in the afternoon with high hopes after reading reviews. It was not very busy and we were seated by the nice hostess. This is where it went down hill. It took 25 min before our drink order was taken, we are aware of the time as we set a timer due to using metered parking so we didn't have to worry about a ticket. The waiter was not personable at all. I ordered a cider and my husband a flight. I was half way through my cider by the time his flight arrived from the bar. At this point it had been close to 40 min and we decided we were not ordering food since it had taken so long to just get drinks. We saw many other people seated during this time and it appeared their wait staff was extremely attentive. An hour later after only seeing our waiter a total of two times (once to order drinks and once more after) we had to flag down another employee to get our check (who was extremely friendly). It was a very disappointing first visit. I would love to go back and try their TV dinner which is served on Tue, and if we attempt will probably just sit at bar. We left and had dinner elsewhere that night."}
{"text":"The avocado salad is one of the best I've seen eaten.  Dressed in champagne vinegrette.   The grilled cheese is another great dish served with non greasey fries and home made ketchup.  More like marinara. Spacious. Sports on the big screens. Corn hole in the the back yard. Plenty of outdoor seating. Sunshade over half. 30 beers on tap. Half a dozen wines as well.  I had a Bundaberg ginger beer. Yum. Haven't had one since Australia. Kind staff.   3 non gender bathroom stalls. The music was decent for us old folks.  Billboard top 10 of 1984. I just wish this place was adult only."}
{"text":"Happy hour deals are amazing here.  $7 flatbread pizza are generously portioned.  $4 draft beers can't be wrong either.  Food was excellent"}
{"text":"Two words \"Brûlée Burger\". Now, go get one! This is a great place for anyone looking for a great beer selection and food choices that go beyond the typical pub menu. Angel's Trumpet has something for everyone (save some room for the pop tart of the day). The only draw back is that they don't have a full bar (beer and wine only) but don't let that stop you from having a great time here!"}
{"text":"Cool place to come and have a beer, knowledgeable friendly staff, outside misters. And no smoking,  yea, great"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place is a good place to hit on the first Friday is your class a Gastro pub reminded me a lot of Portland the food was good the beer list was fantastic and they have beers and wines from all over the country which was really great I couldn't give it five stars because my waitress didn't really know the revolving tap menu which took a star away sorry I'm almost positive Alyssa will get it right the next time on there.... Love her"}
{"text":"Holy crap, that was good.  Had dinner here last night after a super fun time across the street playing video games, and we left duly impressed.    I had the seasonal Summer Salad with assorted greens, candied pepitas, feta, mango, strawberries, red onions and side of grilled chicken (extra), and my better half had the smoky beef tacos with a side of refried beans and freshly made chicharrónes, which he sweetly split with me.  Our food was fantastic, our server was friendly and efficient and the price was fair.  We will be back...soon."}
{"text":"The place is very modern, unisex bathrooms. Great place for happy hour, many many good selections of beer. The food, stick to the basics. Pizza is good, wings always a bit dry. Hummus is bla, had the viva something tacos with brisket. I didny enjoy them, brisket was dry and tortillas cold. I will keep going for the beer and pizza. Good date selection."}
{"text":"Fun, active ale house with a strong selection of brews to choose from. Nice to see some options on Nitrogen and that a few local breweries are on tap. Menu is solid gastro fare. All in all, a great spot"}
{"text":"This place is my Underground Olive Garden. It doesn't serve noodles with ketchup sauce (to my knowledge) but if its name wasn't Angels Trumpet it would be Underground Olive Garden. It just feels that hip.   It's the type of place that \"The Middle\" by Dj Snake would play ad Infinitum. It's chill yet hip. Diverse yet monochromatic. Liberal but conservative. The place truly caters to all personality types.  I got a burger because I had just watched that episode of SpongeBob when he dueled Poseidon for best Kraby Patty - and also because I need to eat something to stop that rising feeling of drunkenness.  Legit though. Their craft beer and hamburgers are on point. I got a cider and it did not disappoint. Like dat Appleseed boi himself made it. And then the hamburger and fries were to die for. I legit zoned out my friends talking to me for at least an hour (I am not a fast eater) because I was too focused on eating my burger.  When I was done, I got the check in a timely manner from a kind waiter. It was quite affordable!   Angels was a nice stop to refresh and  refuel before I went back out on the town. If you're a Phoenix resident - get in there now and chow down, it will be worth it. If you're just passing through, make sure half your stay is here. For real."}
{"text":"We went here after a Dbacks game on a Sunday. The place was moderately busy but loud. They have a HUGE selection of craft beers and a decent selection of food to go with it. The service was so-so. They had 3 guys working behind the bar and only one really took the time to converse with us.   This is one of the newer business on Roosevelt Row so it is a typical trendy place in downtown Phoenix. Overall, not a bad place to grab a beer downtown. Just don't go expecting much conversation with your bartender."}
{"text":"What a cool place. Love this place. Want good beer, go here. They have like 50 on tap all of the time and the service staff knows their stuff (they get a \"shift beer\" when they work, even). I like their outside area but they need to enforce the no smoking. Inside I always sit at the high tables.   Their pork burger is to die for. We love their PB&J and their pizza is to die for. The only thing I hate is their ketchup, which is like homemade crushed tomatoes. Yuck.  I'd go more if their WIFI was stronger. I have to sit near the bathrooms to get a good connection. The staff promises they're trying to fix this. Also, please please make a huge north facing sign so more people know you're there.  If you are lost, find Film Bar. They're across the street."}
{"text":"What can I say? Easy parking, fresh food and service with a smile? No complaints here! We will definitely be back. But next  time-we're playing some cornhole!! Who's WITH me?!?!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab a beer after work! I have had several of their craft beers and the servers made great recommendations each time. I enjoy sitting on the patio and hanging out  when I'm there. Also, the owner Mat is very friendly and does a GREAT job making this a fun place to have a brew"}
{"text":"My favorite bar to go to in Phoenix!  Great selection of beers! And the food is absolutely delicious! Also I love the environment!!"}
{"text":"Flat bread and poutine (the mess) were delish. Super busy on a Friday night. Our server was great, will have to come back and try a flight."}
{"text":"The beer list was huge and the snacks we got were delicious. It has a \"yard\" feel to it but without the little kids running around."}
{"text":"Visited here a week after they opened. Cool atmosphere and loved the finishes inside the place. The server was friendly but it took us 50 minutes to get our two beers we ordered! The beer list is located at the back of the bar which was a little difficult to see honestly from all the tables.  I would say the food was just so-so and seemed greasy to me.    We tried the spud tacos (a little blah and lacked a whole lot of flavor),  the avocado salad (which had greens that were extremely bitter and three small pieces of grapefruit) and the 810 sandwich (which had okay flavor but was greasy). In total, our dinner, took nearly two hours! Luckily I was not in a rush that evening or I would have been extremely frustrated.   Hopefully they'll get the kinks worked out as they are open longer but I can't say I'll be going back."}
