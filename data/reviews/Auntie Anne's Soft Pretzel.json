{"text":"Just like earlier reviews , I received an attitude and bad service. Don't want to honor my card and after I downloaded my apps, don't want to do it.  If there is a lower star than 1, I'd happily give it to them"}
{"text":"I was killing some time near JCPenney, when I noticed they had finally replaced the Pretzelmaker in the corner with an Auntie Anne's.  So, as usual, a snack makes the time go faster ... a garlic-parmesan pretzel with some cheddar dip plus a soda (their idea of a combination meal).  As another reviewer stated, it's a mall pretzel.  But, presented professionally, cheerfully and as promptly as possible (of course, with the Great Bearded Bird's typical luck, I came up right after a rush; they were making fresh pretzels, and I had to wait a few minutes).  While waiting, I fell into conversation with John, the store manager, who was making the pretzels.  We found out we had some background in common, and I discovered he is a professional, cheerful, competent old-school individual.  (No surprise; staff usually mirrors management.)

A three-star pretzel, plus a full star for the boss.  Well done, folks; I will be back.

{"text":"It was 112 degrees out and I still don't know why the boyfriend and I decided to shop at the Premium Outlets when I know damn well that we'll be dying from the heat. Then I saw Auntie Anne's and I knew.. I KNEW, I needed to get a drink stat!

The sole reason I came in was to quench my thirst with their Lemonade Mixers but holy guacamole, I saw the swirling Frozen Lemonade Mixers and found myself with the Strawberry one and the Blue Raspberry one. They were both super refreshing and not overly sweet. Prices were ehhh, but they sure as hell saved me from the scorching Vegas heat. :)"}
{"text":"So bad really for $2 almost all ice thats something i could of got at smiths. And the distastfulness of the cashier's attitude get it together yall put your people on check how my mother \"ponganse riatas\""}
{"text":"My friends and I talked about getting Auntie Anne's pretzels so we were so excited with anticipation. I used a buy one get one coupon. We got there and we ordered, requesting to have our pretzels fresh out the oven. The employees looked tired and serious. The lady said our pretzels were fresh but they just grabbed it out of the display saying it was out of the oven. It definitely was not out of the oven. It's annoying she just said that to satisfy my wishes because there was a line of customers waiting to be served. False reassurance is a crime to customers, businesses and employees alike should realize that! The Auntie Anne's pretzels are fresh at Red Rock casino and Meadows mall. Would not buy here again."}
{"text":"Pretzel was fresh out of the oven. No line so they took their time, which was nice. Came here after my friends were disappointed from the one in Premium Outlet North."}
{"text":"I was hungry. I saw this place so I figured I'd give a shot. They had these pretzel hot dog bites that were amazing. Plus they had Dr. Pepper! Thanks for saving the day."}
{"text":"For some reason the pretzels here are not as good as the ones at other malls I've been to. Also since this location is in a busy outlet mall, there is always a line and sometimes the line is out the door. They have a pretzel stand location near parking garage B that has limited options but does not have a line. I would recommend going there if you just want a pretzel or lemonade and don't require a full menu of items"}
{"text":"I didn't like the free samples and I should have just walked away. However, there isn't much for quick snacks at the Premium Outlets that you don't have to stand in a long line for. 

A pretzel and a pretzel dog later, my stomach wished I had just went else where. I guess it's not for everyone - and that everyone is me. 

If you disagree, that's ok - you can have them all for yourself"}
{"text":"Stomach ache city.

This location is super scummy. Even though I am an avid fan of Auntie Anne's, this location turns me off. One of the female employees has major attitude; I mean talk about very rude and unprofessional. 

You don't want your food handled here, trust me. We ordered the garlic pretzel like we always do and for some reason this location did away with the sweet mustard which was my favorite. Hard feelings aside, I immediately had stomach pain and food poisoning. It wasn't fun. I have never have a bad experience at Auntie Anne's, we love them. But this location is the worst.   

Now, when we want a snack after outlet shopping we hit up DQ since we know their pretzels are basic but won't ruin us.

Let this be your PRO TIP.
& enjoy outlet shopping!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Buy 2 pretzel and large drink and get free pretzel, and display pretzel cups and don't honor that such false advertisement. Not a happy customer. Then they start arguing and getting defensive. If I could not give a star I would. They need to fix this. Use a pretzel picture instead of the pretzel cup"}
{"text":"Don't judge me, but I love carbs!! Especially when they come in the form of warm, soft delicious pretzels!! I work literally 20 seconds away from this location so it's hard not to come here everyday. You can smell the goodness baking from outside and since they are always busy, you know that your pretzel is going to be fresh. 

The factors that are making this review a 3 star instead of a 4 or 5? I'm not ok with paying $3 for a piece of bread pretty much. That's more than an entire loaf of bread at the grocery store. Another thing, the wait times are ridiculous. You can be in line for over 10 minutes since there are always so many people. The employees are super unprofessional and not so nice. 

But whatever. I love carbs and despite all the negatives, my fat butt will be back to fulfill my cravings."}
{"text":"The pretzels didn't look so fresh, and the shift leader has an attitude."}
{"text":"My favorite place to visit, but I wish I could give this location a negative star on customer service. We stopped in to grab a drink while we shopped. We waiting patiently as we watched the 2 staff personnel roll dough. It was apparent no one was at the register to take our orders. The line grew to six people and not an ounce of acknowledgement by staff. Two of the 6 customers left after realizing no one was being served. A courtesy, \"someone will be with you wouldn't hurt. It actually would have kept a negative review from being posted. Hopefully someone from corporate will read this and use this post as an opportunity for customer service retraining."}
{"text":"I knew Auntie Anne's Pretzels from my last vacation in Manhattan, NYC and wanted to recreate my positive feelings.
The place was pretty crowded when I arrived but I didn't had to wait too long make my order. 
But then i had to wait nearly 15 minutes for my pretzel nuggets with cinnamon sugar... not the best thing when you're craving for some pretzels! 
Finally I got what I ordered and it was basically OK, nothing special or anything, a bit less yummy than my last time in NY."}
{"text":"I love love love their huge unsalted (and cinnamon sugar) pillowy soft delicious pretzels. I am a big fan of soft (and hard, for that matter) pretzels- great snacks unless they have too much butter. I just don't like salt too much. Pretzels can be a healthy alternative to other mall choices provided it's not soaked in salt and butter. The other pretzel companies try to outdo Auntie Anne's but I really don't think that they can. Jeez, craving one as I am typing up my review. 

Participant in the Passport Booklet (free to AAA members or VIP Premium Outlets Members; get it at the customer service desk at the very front of the center). A few small tables in the middle of the aisle outside the store provided."}
{"text":"BEST MALL FOOD @AuntieAnnes Pretzels 

Hard to believe another 1st to Review!!?!!

Great pretzels, Cheap,filling and flavorful snack for on the go at any mall.

Don't forget to get a lemonade too.

I like them all but I tried the Sour Cream & Onion this time since I had a FREE coupon I won on Twitter.

Great Stuff but I still like the Pepperoni Pizza Pretzel & the Pretzel Dog."}
{"text":"FREE Lemonade Mixer from @AuntieAnnes on @twitter. Thanks!:-)

I tried the Watermelonade and it was just as refreshing as it sounds.

My Favorite Pretzel place-you have to try their NEW pepperoni pizza pretzel with marinara!!

A change from that  old slice of pizza.

{"text":"Walking through the mall, sometimes you want one of those soft pretzels with dipping sauces they are serving up.

On this particular occasion, we ordered the sour cream and onion pretzel with the nacho cheese and salsa dipping sauce, a garlic pretzel with nacho cheese and salsa dipping sauce, and a pretzel dog.

I can't remember much else because within 15 minutes of finishing, I was in search of the ladies' room.  Stomach cramps, chills, and the sweats...ran to the toilet and out it went.  Bad cheese, perhaps?

(I do still visit other pretzel locations when I'm at the mall, this so happens to be the only time I visited this Auntie Anne's location.)"}
{"text":"Typical mall pretzel. I prefer wretzels pretzel better normally, but since they don't have it at this location, I chose this instead. 

The samples given are always beyond delicious--very flavorful and just the right temperature--you can't help but want to get in line for your own. But the ones that they have for sale always pale in comparison when it comes to the sample. The flavor is vague, so I'm sure they make sure that the samples that go out are tossed and tossed again to make sure they get the most on it."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Stood in a long line and once it was my turn the worker takes someone who walked up past the long line and starts ordering. Then says \"oh why is everyone standing in line?!\"  How do you work somewhere and not get the concept of a line?! The customer who cut everyone took the last of what was made. Place didn't deserve my money and waiting even longer."}
{"text":"Yummy and delicious quick snack while shopping."}
{"text":"So disappointed this time.  The cheese was watered down and when I tried my sprite it was just carbonated water. When I let them know it wasn't sprite and before I could finish  my sentence she said \"yes it Sprite\". I just ended up getting a refund."}
{"text":"The inside of the store looks pretty old, and the lines are usually long whenever I stop by here. Because of the old interior, the kitchen doesn't look very sanitary either, so you shouldn't expect much quality for the pretzels either.

The cinnamon sugar pretzel nuggets come in a tall cup, so you get a good amount of nuggets. They coat the nuggets in tons of cinnamon sugar though, that the last bits of pretzel nuggets are absolutely caked in sugar! This can either be a pro or con, depending on how much sugar you like on your pretzels."}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations. I stopped here early in the morning at the beginning of a road trip to Southern California to get some fresh-baked snacks for the road. I got 4 different varieties and all were fresh and excellent. The pretzel bread quality was excellent and fresh, and compares favorably with any Bakery product."}
{"text":"The food was good. I was just really annoyed with the customer service provided. The shift leader, Diamond, took long pauses during my transaction to speak to her friend that was in line behind me about some work drama. Apparently someone filed a complaint about her and she felt it was necessary to deal with that first.. People who conduct business like that shouldn't be in management positions.."}
