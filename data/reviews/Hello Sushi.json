{"text":"Great little place with excellent prices!  Chef was our waiter (slow night) & was very helpful. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that they don't serve alcohol & it would be nice to have a sake with our meal.

We both got the semi lunch (a mixed roll/sushi plate & veggie plate) for $7 each! All were fresh & tasted great. Miso soup was good & tea was a nice extra. $19 including tax for both our meals & I had leftovers!

We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Hello and goodbye!!! 

I was disappointed with the \"quality\" of fish here. Actually, it was probably the least fresh tasting sushi I've had in years. (And I've eaten a lot of mediocre sushi!) 

I'm not giving Hello Sushi only one star because the owner/sushi chef/server was nice enough and it could have just been a bad day when I was there. Nonetheless, I can't imagine a reason I would ever return."}
{"text":"This place was my favourite place to go for sushi. The prices were unbeatable, and the quality was astounding. Unfortunately, I was incredibly disappointed to discover that this place has closed down. NoOoOo! :("}
