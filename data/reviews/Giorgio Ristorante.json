{"text":"Après plus de deux heures d'attente nous avons finalement eu nos plats! Des plats sans goûts et froid. Nous sommes huit dans une petite salle qui en contient plus de cinquante places et certaines tables se sont vidées sans avoir reçu leurs plats. Des clients sont partis sans payer et nous allons demander la mène chose. Bref Giorgio a eu de meilleures années et ils devraient revoir leur concept parce que ça fait vraiment pitié!! Un local sera probablement en location bientôt si des changements ne sont pas effectués rapidement. Aucune étoile pour ce restaurant..."}
{"text":"I used to love this place growing up, but unfortunately the service has been getting worse every year. I would not recommend this restaurant.  The summary of my last experience consists of waiting 15 minutes to be seated (with a reservation), 45 minutes for someone to take my order, an hour for them to bring the food and once receiving my order I noticed that they got my order wrong. They had written chicken parmesan on the menu and gave me veal without asking if it was okay. Their excuse was that they ran out of chicken, but didn't think to ask me if it was okay to substitute!   It was unprofessional on their part and unacceptable. I left their unhappy, hungry and never wanting to return."}
{"text":"When I first arrived to Giorgio there was a line of people waiting for table to be available. It took a while for the tables to be available but once we got in it was worth it. The food was delicious, the dessert was fantastic and the servers were very polite.   Ah, you can also bring your own wine. I really enjoyed the evening and I would certainly come back. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Our friend recommended this place telling us that the new management has dramatically improved the place and they were proven right. The pasta was great, the pesto and BBQ pizza was amazing and the shrimp gratin was my favorite. Manager personally came to our table to ensure that we were satisfied. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have been all over and had plenty of Italian food. I looked around my hotel for something good to eat I saw a picture of a little fat man that is pretty much the symbol of Italian food. I was expecting a pizzaria or some kind of mom and pop shop. Giorgio is defiantly not either of those. I suddenly realized that I was under dressed in my t-shirt and jeans. Still the server showed me to my seat and was very quick to realize french was not my first language and offered me an English menu. I always feel bad coming to another country and not being able to speak the language. Still the waiter made me feel at home, trying his best to explain the things I didn't understand.  I was expecting the Olive Garden style of food and service. It was slightly busy so I expected my order to take a little while. But then something strange happened. I got my food before my drink, and not in a bad way. About 5 minutes after ordering my drink and food I had my food (and a minute later my drink). Not only was the pasta fast it was fantastic. The portions were very nice sized and I left happy. While a little on the pricy side for my usual taste this place is worth every penny."}
{"text":"La nourriture est médiocre, les prix trop élevés, la musique trop forte... Je n'y retournerai pas."}
{"text":"I attended a birthday party of 24 people that seated our group in 3 tables of 8. My dining experience went as follows.  Pros :  - I went with their \"Veal Parmesan\" with a side penne (they didn't have rigatoni..?) with a rose sauce.The \"Veal Parmesan\" was good with the meat tasting alright (it may have been a bit overcooked though ) but plenty of Parmesan.   - At first the service was very accommodating, at least for the first 30 minutes or so then it all went downhill as the resto got busy.  - Ordered a soda, it came in a bottle. I always find this a plus when soda come in bottles. I'm OK with cans but don't serve me fountain soda unless I'm at a food court.  Cons :  - The service completely dropped off the charts after 30 minutes. They seemed completely overwhelmed.  Tables weren't getting food at the same time. I understand we were 24 but they took orders by the table... why not serve a table at the same time then? It's very awkward getting your plate and your significant other getting theirs nearly 10 minutes later when you almost finished your plate. I find this unprofessional and unacceptable! Everyone at a table should be getting food around the same time. We also shouldn't be waiting for an hour for our food. Hire more staff and find ways to get meals out faster and more efficiently (without forsaking quality) to fix that issue.  - The pasta in my plate didn't feel very fresh and the rose sauce had too much liquid and too little flavor. Was this made in house?  I'd would rather have went with something else but for a place that claims to be Italian, some effort in their pasta is necessary to convince this Italian. Sorry!  - A meal for two will set you back about $100. Basically, it's about $50 for both plates, $10 for drinks and another $25 for dessert/coffee. Add tip and taxes and there's the bill. I find this quite expensive for mediocre food. I feel that they should go with a table d'hote instead which consists of an entree (soup or salad), a main then a coffee with a select menu of dessert of your choice. There can be extras here and there. I'm alright with paying about $25-30 per person. $50 though? No thanks.  - Ordered a cappuccino, it arrived cold?! This means the 30 minutes I waited for dessert my coffee, it was probably sitting on a counter somewhere for about 20 minutes. No. Noooo.  - Creme Brulee should be served hot or room temperature. Serving it cold is so anticlimatic for such a delicate dessert.  I think next time I'll just opt out to coming here and just send my friend a birthday gift instead. Lol"}
