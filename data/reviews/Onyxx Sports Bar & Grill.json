{"text":"When I heard that Brampton native David (Junior) Hoilett had opened a sports bar in Brampton, I was excited to drop in for a look.   As Jr is a professional soccer player, the bar does well to include a healthy amount of soccer matches along with the best of Toronto's sports teams.   The service is prompt, professional and genuine. I felt right at home.   Although the menu caters to all pallettes, at Onyxx, the Jamaican roots of the owners shines through remarkably (jerk chicken poutine!)    This is arguably the best bar/restaurant in Brampton and definitely worth a try. Come for the food, sports and friendly crowd."}
{"text":"Visited on a Wednesday evening. It was quiet, the servers were friendly.   I ordered the pink passion. The drinks are strong but not too strong. The prices are reasonable as well.   I also ordered the jerk chicken poutine which was flavorful but could use a little more gravy.  Overall place has great potential. I will be going back"}
{"text":"I love their wings and the jerk chicken poutine definitely a great chill vibe to relax and watch sports while having a good meal."}
{"text":"I have visited this place a number of times and never a disappointment. Staff are attentive and friendly and they have huge screens to watch sports games. The best part is the food- the wings are huge and the flavours are wide ranging and so tasty. Tip- ask if there are any flavours which are not listed on the menu. The oxtail poutine is probably my fav dish as I order it each and every time! Great spot to go for a chill night out"}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is delicious and the prices are good.  The female servers are great; the guys not so much.  I wish the kitchen was open later.  Other than that highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Omg  the oxtail poutine  is one of the best things I've  ever had....ever ever. The service was just as great  as the atmosphere. Karaoke Sunday  had a great vibe."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. Jerk poutine, jerk chicken, oxtail and much more.    Wings on Tuesday are half price. Try the jerk chicken wings if you are in to hot wings they are to die for!"}
{"text":"vegan burger is amazing. it's made with jackfruit and a bbq sauce to resemble pulled pork! the oxtail and jerk chicken poutines are to die for, wings are the best i've had from anywhere. way better than wild wings! the owner also cooks in the kitchen, so most sauces are made in house and the gravies don't come from a package. cooked from scratch! gotta try the poutines hands down, especially the oxtail!"}
{"text":"Came in here after work after hearing about this new brampton bar from a friend. First of all this is exactly what brampton has needed. An upscale bar lounge which has never been done. The vibe was chill & welcoming. I came in on a Monday night so not to crazy busy as normal for any bar in the early week. my server was very friendly & professional. I ordered the jerk chicken poutine. No Regrets!!!  it was so flavourful & filling. I'll definitely come back to try some other choice menu items. Most likely on a weekend so I can check out the vibe.."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. They gave my friend pasta that was not vegan, but said it was. They still charged us full price. Slow, way too loud, and overall annoying atmosphere."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this new spot in the Brampton area. Wasn't too far from Rexdale, decided to check it out. From the outside it's tinted so you can't see what's inside except blue lights shinning through the tint.  Once you walk in it's a sports bar, pool table, huge TVs hanging on the wall, nice genuine vibe, heard it was owned by Jamaicans which made sense to the menu they had which offered Jerk Chicken! Which was pretty dope.  I tried the Dry Rub Buffalo & Mango wings and boy lemme tell you im more of a saucy get your hands messy kind of guy when it comes to wings but I might have found my new favourite wing flavour. I was so excited that I honestly forgot to take a picture and post it up on here.   The environment was authentic only a few people were there on a Monday night watching the Raptors game vs Cavs, the waitress took care of us checked up on us frequently which was nice! Only positive vibes from this place.   Would I come back? Most definitely and very soon! I rate it 5 all day."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and I really enjoyed the layout of the resturant. They have a pool table and plenty of screens to watch sports on. If you are tired of going to the chain resturants around the area (Boston Pizza, Montanas, East Side Marios etc), this is a refreshing place to enjoy food and/or drinks. Very intriguing menu selection and they also have plenty of beers on tap. If you arein the area, check it out."}
