{"text":"Just came back from The Crown and all I have to say is WOW, and not in a good way.  Have you ever been in a BAR and the server did not know what Guinness was or if the establishment sold it.  The entire bar is plastered with Guinness logos and they could not even have the decency to have ANY Irish beer! After all it's not like it is St. Patrick's Day.    You did get some things right.  The place looks great, the band was amazing and nobody parties like Richmond Hillers.  Owners we deserve more..... we work hard and we spend money.  All we ask is that you have the food that is on the menu and you have alcohol.  Not just tall boys.  I often go to pubs and this has been one of the worst experiences. I wish all the luck for the new owners, but if you keep going this way, I will most likely not come back until the new ownership.  My advice is don't serve food, because it terrible.  Take a bartending course and learn to clean you lines, because you tap bear taste terrible.  Go to the liquor store with your menu and buy all the ingredients that it takes to make the drinks in it....simple.  If your staff is new, don't put them out there on the busiest days.  I know that everyone needs to start somewhere, READ YOUR MENU AND KNOW IT INSIDE AND OUT.  Good luck and Happy St. Patrick's Day"}
{"text":"There aren't too many bars in the area and they have raptors and leaf game nights which are cheap pitchers. I enjoyed the service and the live music on Friday night was pretty good. The crowd was a little older with some cougars and some older men who might have made questionable choices in their lives due to their behaviour, intoxication level and appearance.   This review didn't knock this place from the crowd but from the fish n chips. The fish are basa fillets from a Chinese supermarket (T&T across the street?).  These basa fillets are $2 for 2 huge pieces in a bag from T&T. The batter was so thin and soft after being prepared. The fish has so much water content from being flash frozen I wonder if they fry it from a frozen state.  The coleslaw was bland as well.   The only positive is that the fries were real chip wagon chips and there was Granville Island on tap."}
{"text":"2.5 Star: Soft Opening review as it was just open the day before our visit  This used to be The Crown and Phoenix before it underwent extensive renovation/makeover plus change of management and becomes The Crown Bar and Grill.  The new owners which used to be the employees of the old establishment did a wonderful job in renovating the place from a dark/divey pub into modern and chic looking bar!   A bunch of us dropped by on the 2nd day of their Grand Opening with no expectation as we were just looking for a place for some beers. They do have $12 pitcher specials during Leaf games on Canadian and Coor Lights which are not my fave but at this price.. we all agreed to share a couple of pitchers!  Service was excellent and our server was really nice and sweet.   The Crown Bar is not a bad choice if you just want to have some cheap drinks and not too picky.    Hopefully they will be making more changes to make them different than better than all these pubs up along this area.. Maybe just getting One local crafted beer in would be a nice start?"}
