{"text":"At the hospital for a family member. And this little bistro deli is awesome. Food tastes as good as Panera Bread. At half the price. I had the chicken salad sandwich and bacon chowder. Super good. And the Philly steak looked good as well. Coffee and other drinks as well. My mind was blown. BOOM!!"}
{"text":"This is a little cafe off the lobby of the Dominican Tower of St. Rose Siena Hospital. I usually don't eat breakfast, and haven't been eating much for the last while as Ive been spending a ton of time with a loved one who has been in the hospital for over two weeks. This morning, however, I found myself starving, so I went down there and for three bucks and change I got a hot ham, egg and cheese sandwich on an english muffin. My expectations were low (hospital food, yuck) but I was really surprised at how good it was. They put quite a bit of ham on it, and the whole thing was hot, moist and delicious. If this was served at a convenient drive through somewhere- rather than having to go to the hospital, park in the garage and then hoof it though the parking lot into the lobby- I'd be getting this sandwich more often. 

On another note, I thought their hot tea was overpriced. In addition, who knows what she the hours of that place is. A nurse from upstairs told me they had trouble staffing it, so lately it was a roll of the dice on whether it was open. I've walked by several times when the giant metal grate had bees dropped over the whole thing (like what you see at malls when a shop closes)."}
{"text":"If you are visiting a loved one or waiting in the ER, this is a great spot. Best variety of flavors coffee, huge salads, fresh, they'll even toss it for you. Chili con carne or soup de hour....  everything is great. The staff is helpful and quick. The ER physicians are there for quick in and out. Have TV to watch sports or news."}
