{"text":"The coffee is really good and breakfast sandwiches are ok, but the staff is just not friendly at all. I came with my baby to get something for my breakfast to go, and for one moment I thought babies were not allowed in the place because both staff members were rude when my baby was bubbling around. You guys could really just make an effort for a smile or good morning, otherwise it doesn't matter how good is your food."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to know about this place! For people familiar with Vancouver, this place totally reminds me of Tractor. But it might even be better than Tractor and that's saying a lot. The food is fresh and bursting with flavor, and the prices are totally reasonable for the quality you get. I love the salmon and grilled chicken for proteins, and my fave sides are the kale Cesar and Greek salad. My husband likes the chicken burger and meatballs. I can't wait to try more stuff. After discovering this place last week we've had 3 meals from here. I wish they did a weekly delivery plan or something. I'd be their #1 customer! Delivery is available via foodora and Ubereats too."}
{"text":"Yet to have a meal I didn't love. Fantastic plant based options and animal based options as well. Coffee is excellent. Patio is adorable. Staff is superb. One of the best places that caters to vegans, vegetarians and carnivores alike."}
{"text":"The food here is always good and there is a wide selection of choices. You choose the number of proteins and sides you want and then select from the meat, veggies and salads. I always leave satisfied. I think there's something for everyone here and the dishes are always fresh. Good for breakfast, lunch or dinner. My only complaint is the lack of seating and I have often gone here for a meal but left because all seats were full. No reserving so check for seats before you order."}
