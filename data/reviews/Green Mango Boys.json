{"text":"Great food and great service. I had the chicken bun (chicken with vermicelli) and it was good. Decent size and serving  for the price and tasty. Quick and friendly service. There was a constant stream of people coming and going for dine in and take out. Family friendly but the place is small."}
{"text":"I was sick a few weeks ago and a friend brought me some pho from here.

I can't really comment on service or price because I didn't buy it.

I will say though that for being take away it was still very fresh and good. I felt a lot better after eating it.

Hopefully when I have time I can go here and try more stuff."}
{"text":"I love their food but... they got roaches. Employee smushed a roach next to the condiment stand after I pointed it out to him with his bare hand and kept doing a nervous shimmy asking me where the roach came from... I don't know, maybe the overflowing garbage bin next to the counter you serve food on? Probably won't eat here again for that reason alone."}
{"text":"Best pho place ever! Beef carrot stew is to die for! I wish they have a location Downtown."}
{"text":"I work in the mall and this is my go-to place if I want something filing and fresh. They cook the food when you order it. You know the food hasn't been siting there for a while and they just warm it up for you. I can never seem to finish my whole meal unless I'm STARVING. Their bubble tea is good and reasonably priced for the amount you get. The tapioca always used to be stuck together making it hard to drink until I asked for it to be spread apart. They have a loyalty card, so for every $8 (I think) you spend, you get a stamp and when you reach a certain amount (less than 8-9), you get a free meal :) I don't know if their pricing is good or not, as this is the only Vietnamese place I eat at. The service is excellent, even before I started showing up regularly.

EDIT: you must now spend $8 for every 12 meals (was 8 before) to get 1 free meal."}
{"text":"One of the better Pho restaurants out there, fresh and delicious. I wish they had more locations."}
{"text":"Took my mom there the other day so she could try Banh Mi. It was delicious and fresh. It's a great addition to Cloverdale a nice place to sit down and relax after shopping. Tip also had a cup of broth because it was more than a it nippy that day, it turned out to be a huge cup of warm, tasty goodness.

Happy to recommend, will be back frequently"}
{"text":"Employee rage!!!

Staff throwing dishes when cleaning up customers plates. 

Lady with baby asked him to stop because he was scaring her baby. He didn't, so she cancelled her order she was waiting for."}
{"text":"Are you looking for some quick pho in the Etobicoke area?  Look no further than heading to Cloverdale Mall for some yummy Green Mango Boys' pho!

They have a take-out counter in the mall where you can get your Vietnamese and Thai staple dishes.  They are quick to service and even have an area to dine-in if you like.

Prices VERY affordable, all you have to do is stop by if you are in the area for quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I wanted to try vegetarian Pho and someone told me they serve good Pho. I got a take away from here and found it good. But I am not sure if I am coming back again."}
{"text":"Part of the Green Mango family.
The food is a mix of Thai & Vietnamese.
Everything is made fast & Fresh in front of you. 
The staff are always friendly to !!"}
{"text":"Well I decided to give GMB another go after my last attempt (they hadn't yet received their Banh Mi buns an hour after opening). I had to once again attempt to order a BBQ Beef Banh Mi.

After paying my $7.00+, I was a little shocked to see how little meat hit the grill. It sat over the hot flames for at least five minutes rendering it even smaller. I found it very odd that upon completion of the cooking of the beef, the \"cook\" quickly plated it and slid it through a window where the sandwich was \"dressed\" by someone else in the back kitchen. Odd because there was a full condiment bar right in front of me and I would have LOVED the ability to have request hot sauce and extra cilantro. What if I wanted no cilantro? What if...

When the guy came out of the back kitchen the sandwich was already wrapped and bagged so I decided not to complain about my inability to customize whatsoever.

As someone else suggested, it seems that you might have to keep on top of these guys when ordering a Banh Mi because it would seem that my bun was in the oven for the entire time that the beef cooked. It was completely devoid of any moisture and crackled in my mouth like a soda cracker. The flavours of the innards were good but this is a far cry from a good Banh Mi.

Good thing I know of two authentic Banh Mi joints not too far from this place.

I won't return."}
{"text":"Good authentic my opinion better then Thai Express .... fast and clean ....
FYI found it on YELP"}
{"text":"The chicken pad Thai was great, wonderful flavour and also the fried rice was very tasty. I will be back for sure when I'm in the area..."}
{"text":"I've probably had almost everything on the menu here. It is a great location being inside a busy local shopping mall. Nice staff and great authentic, fresh, fast and tasty Thai/Viet food. Its usually busy so if you cant get a seat inside, order your food to go and take it to the food court."}
{"text":"That bbq beef banh mi sandwich.. Delicious!!!! Came back and bought two more one for myself and one for the wifey.  The best place to eat at cloverdale. Will definitely come back again, and have the other dishes and order another sandwich to go. Very nice oil art pieces with a nice modern clean decor."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this tiny Vietnamese restaurant as I was walking around Cloverdale Mall. I ordered the Banh Mi with pork and it was delicious.

I wanted to eat-in but since they were so busy, (it was 12:30 Saturday afternoon), I asked for takeout. The food court is conveniently located close by, with plenty of places to sit and chow down without feeling crowded. 

I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their Bun with pork. My favourite place for this. Staff are always friendly an efficient. Great service overall."}
{"text":"Came to Cloverdale Mall for some Viet Pho while waiting for my colleague to finish with her driver license. Ordered their beef pho and it was delicious. The broth was well aromatized with the green onions and mint leaves. There was a good amount of slides beef and bean sprout. Unlike other Viet restaurant, the mint and bean sprout were already inside the soup. After finishing the pho, I was still hungry. Decided to take out a cold meat viet sandwich. I was disappointed with the sandwich. The bread wasn't crunch and I was having hard time chewing it. The cold meat was more like big block of meat instead of slides."}
{"text":"I love the pho here! They don't skimp on meat and the condiments are fresh and varied. More importantly (for me), the broth is amazing. The service is quick and friendly. Surprisingly, I have always been able to get a seat even though seating is limited. 

Typing this makes me want to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Then they started to skim on the beef....very unfortunate. 

Need to look for another pho place which is not easy in Etobicoke.   May try in a few months and see if it improves. I really want to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Just had an excellent lunch here after doing some shopping at Cloverdale. The menu is not huge but they do the staples very well. My friend had the beef bun and said it was great and I had mango salad and shrimp fresh rolls. The mango salad was was big enough for sharing-fresh and excellent! The fresh rolls were a real treat. I have a usual place near Sherway I go when I'm craving fresh rolls but now I'll be coming here. This is a great lunch spot and will make coming to Cloverdale a real treat. It is miles above the fast food choices at Sherway."}
{"text":"For a mall this is very good Vietnamese style food. 
I like the rare beef (sometimes the cut of meat is not great). 
The prices are fair, I really like that part. 
Serve yourself at counter, avoid unnecessary tipping. The mall is absolute $hit, this is a highlight of the place."}
{"text":"My hubby saw good reviews for this place so we decided to drop in.  It's effectively a semi fancy take out place.  I ordered pho which was my first mistake.  It was ok but not great.  I was also less than impressed when collecting my food they gave us each portion separately at different times and I had to inquire twice about the rest of my order, they kept saying it was coming.  One item I ordered was a side or white rice (which take about 20 seconds to spoon into a bowl) which they forgot about.  I had to ask a few times about that.  My hubby says I shouldn't be perturbed by that but I don't like constantly reminding people about my order.  It's like asking for water over and over again at a restaurant and then saying yes and not bringing it which is his pet peeve.  My pet peeve is constantly asking for something I've already paid for and then saying ok and then not actually giving it to me.  That having been said the rice was fine and my husband's pad thai was also fine."}
{"text":"I love green mango I come here all the time but this time I had a very terrible experience. My order was taken by Philip R. close to closing time, he was very very rude, abrasive and extrremely impatient. I won't be coming here anymore and I will spread the word!"}
{"text":"Awesome food for fast food pricing.  Wife loves the curry.  It reminds her of a place called Thai chef in roncesvalles.  

Pho is a bit blander than restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly really good, which I wasn't expecting from a mall based vietnamese restaurant.  

One of my favourite vietnamese dishes is Bo Kho which is a vietnamese, tomato based beef stew.  Many vietnamese restaurants don't serve it, and the ones that do are hit and miss in terms of quality.

So, when I find a place that actually sells a good version of it, I sit up and take notice.  The restaurants here is clean, and modern and serves many of my favourite vietnamese staples such as Bo Kho, Pho, vietnamese sandwhiches and the grilled meat dishes.  Their menu is not as varied as some vietnamese restaurants, but what they do, they do really well.

The food is really tasty and very reasonably priced and I intend to come here often."}
{"text":"Great Pho, noodle, Thai dishes and Vietnamese food including sandwiches. They do my favourite dish beef bun vermicelli really well here. The fresh rolls are also excellent. Very reasonable price too. Good location in Cloverdale mall."}
{"text":"I visit Cloverdale pretty much all the time (Metro, LCBO, Winners, etc.) and I never gave Green Mango Boys a second thought as I just assumed it was going to be another nasty food court place (similar to the establishment across the way).  However, I recently learned that it's affiliated with Green Mango in the Kingsway.  I've never been there but a lot of people from my office rave about what delicious and authentic Thai food they serve up.

Anyway, I read all the positive Yelp reviews on Green Mango Boys and decided to pop in after work for some take-out.  My first impression was how modern and clean it was - not your typical food court establishment.  It's kind of like Subway meets Noodle Delight but in classy way. They have a few tables near the window if you choose to dine in.  I decided to order Pad Thai with chicken (extra spicy). Can I just mention that they made it to order!  I looked behind the counter and all the veggies looked super, super fresh - you can tell they take pride in what they do. Within five minutes, I got my Pad Thai which was so nicely packaged.  I took a peak at it when I was in the car and I could not believe how good it looked - no way fast food.

The verdict: undeniably one of the best Pad Thai dishes I've had in a very long time!  With Asian food, it's all about texture so I appreciated that the noodles maintained their integrity as they were not overcooked.  It had the right amount of sauce and it was so well-balanced with the sweet, sour, tart, spicy and I could really taste the tamarind.  Also, they did not skimp out on the chicken breast or tofu.  I can't believe this place was right under my nose and I never stopped in.

It was so worth the $9.00 - I will definitely be returning and may try one of the Vietnamese sandwiches."}
{"text":"This location is convenient as they are located inside Cloverdale mall. I found there pricing to be a little expensive for pho, but they do also carry bahn mi's so that is a bonus. A small pho cost $7 where the large cost $8. 

I had the beef pho which was decent, but the amount of beef you get in the meal wasn't that much. I did find the broth to be good but that was the only real highlight to the meal."}
{"text":"New place with excellent Pad Thai. Service was very quick and friendly. Food was excellent. I had the curried chicken. 
Can access from outside the mall by the dollar store. I recommend a try!"}
{"text":"Ummmm.... i wished I liked this better but I ordered the fried rice and it was tasteless.  It was flavourless, the chicken tasted like rubber and they added frozen vegetables to it so after cooking it, it became a mushy mess."}
{"text":"Very tasty. It's more like a food court place though. Nothing fancy. Prices are average"}
{"text":"Decent Bahn Mi. I had the one with BBQ Chicken. I also ordered the soup which was $1 along with the sandwich. Really good broth. Good sandwich. Decent price. No issues. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"Went to this place a couple of days ago and the first thing I noticed when walking in is how nice the seating and atmosphere was. Than, I noticed the menu which offered mainly thai dishes and some vietnamese. This raised a red flag, Vietnamese and Thai? mmmm. How authentic can this be. I ordered the pho, and chicken pad thai. The pho is good but I definitely had way better. The pad thai was also good, again, I had better. If you're looking for good fast food and in Etobicoke, check it out. But if you're looking for good pho, don't go here. Overall, average."}
{"text":"I would say this place is more like 4.5*. That missing half a star is because they don't offer tendon, tripe, or beef balls for pho options. However, their menu selection is basic and it works for this business inside a mall. Keeping it simple is a great way to run the business. 
Pho is decent. Especially impressed with how much veggies u get in the veggie pho (keep in mind broth is chicken based tho so not truly vegetarian or vegan). 
The grilled meat with rice is excellent particularly the beef option and comes with pickled veggies too which is a great accompaniment to the entree. The chicken spring rolls are very good as well. But I mostly enjoy this item on menu which is usually available at Vietnamese pho restos. The Bahn Mi. Vietnamese sandwich consisting of grilled meat, pickled veggies on a French bun. Soooo good!"}
{"text":"Updated Review: Feb 9th 2016
They have discontinued their vegetarian broth option. In fact, once a server told us that it never was vegetarian in the first place. I'm done with this place. This is unethical and completely disgusting. From eating here every week, I will never go to this establishment ever again. If you're not vegetarian, and don't mind unethical people, check out my previous glowing review below:



I eat here at least once, if not twice a week. I always order the vegetarian pho. They use vegetarian broth, which is hard to find. It's tasty and sumptuous. A large is enough for 2 small meals. Generous portion of rice noodles and vegetables. They're always willing to give as many sauces as I need. They're sweet and honest people. Once I left my debit card behind and they immediately called and let me know; saved me a world of trouble. My husband used to order the beef pho and he has moved to the vegetarian one too as it's simply amazing."}
