{"text":"This place is not just a restaurant has a great bar and a outside deck with one of the best views of Las Vegas. The food is good and selections is limited. Drink are on the expensive side and it is a private club. I would recommend there steak with crab. It has a disco at night at 10 pm the space is small and can be crowded. I would recommend this place and I am going back again."}
{"text":"We have been members for several years and the place never disappoints us.  Great food, good drinks and a fantastic atmosphere.  Of course there's the view from the balcony as well.  We have taken dozens of people here and all of them have loved the place.  You can also arrange to have people on the guest list when you're not in town, a very nice perk."}
{"text":"Located on the top of Mandalay Bay, Foundation Room has an awesome view. It's kind of like the Mix Club that's located on top of The Hotel, but has a Buddha theme going on.   I went here for my cousins after party and thought it was cool, it wasn't crowded. But around 11:30, there were a lot of people. I only noticed two rooms which were not that big. The main room and the room that is located near the hallway."}
{"text":"This place saved our night and the view was amazing. It's not packed but that's the best part for us, we're not bumping into people and everyone there was super friendly. The drinks are cheap and strong, not the $21 water down vodka cran you find at most nightclubs. The music is top 40 hip hop and there's another dj that plays different music in the back. The hosts and the staff are also great. We will probably visit this place every time we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"I ate here Friday night this week.  We made a reservation. We were sat quickly, but it took some time to get water and drinks ordered.  That was the only complaint I had.  After that the service was great and the food was excellent. The Thai dish was the group favorite!"}
{"text":"Maybe I was spoiled by Tryst the night before or maybe it just wasn't my type of club, but the only good thing about this club is the view of the strip. Lots of old school hip hop which i normally like to dance to, but the setup of the club/lounge wasn't what i expected. They have lots of empty couches that nobody can sit on bc it's RESERVED. Didn't like the carpeted dingy floors. One dance floor playing house and the hip hop was all over the place near the bar. Dancing was difficult with ppl bumping in to you trying to get over to the bar or the patio. Come for the view, leave for a better club."}
{"text":"Was just asked to leave our seats rudely to seat other people who apparently wanted to sit down. Who knows. Something about being reserved but no sign was posted. Very, very rude. Made us feel like like shit. They could give no explanation. Won't recommend anyone to come here. If this lack of disrespect can happen to us then watch out people.  They deserve 0 stars!!"}
{"text":"If you want to unwind after gambling all day or walking the strip. This is the place to do it. It has secluded seating, a giant fireplace, the best view of the strip (from the top of Mandalay Bay), and some of the best food in town.  There staff is very friendly and helpful and the mood of the whole place really helps you to relax and get away from all the noise and chaos of the strip and casinos.  Whether your up here to just hang out in the lounge or for a full meal, you won't be disappointed. The only thing you need to be aware of is that it's not open to just anyone. You have to be on the guest list to be granted access to the private elevator. If your a VIP of the hotel though it's usually not an issue to get in."}
{"text":"Came on a club crawl. Was a great view. Place was a little packed and couldn't get a drink. Music was way too loud on the outside dance floor. Think someone farted in the elevator so that was a minus lol....Seriously it was gross....Bartender was a little bit rude but I'm sure just cuz she was busy. The on left with the tattoos....Overall a great place to check out once for sure"}
{"text":"Do not miss one of the best views in the City, with great drinks and awesome bartenders. Cauliflower Tempura is to die for. Shout out to Sarah, Ozzy, and John who took great care of us. Good music in the evening too. Ask for John to make you a mai tai and you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. The security guards think they are in the military. They are abusive and should all be fired . Don't waste a penny at this place. Will tell everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Top marks for lounge space and view.   Bartender Hayley (Hailey?) hates the world. This chick should be pushing paper in a cubicle. Very obviously not cut out for her customer-facing job. After waiting patiently for 20 minutes, I politely asked for a drink. This request was met with Hayley's index finger. It should be noted that the lounge was not crowded.   I summoned the manager, who took care of my drink...and hopefully fired the grouchy bartender. I will return, and I will complain about Hayley until she puts on a happy face, or moves on to a clerical job. Not worth letting a bad bartender spoil an otherwise awesome place."}
{"text":"great view, sort-of, of the strip. it's at an angle, but still pretty decent. went to this place once, but fell in love immediately. the comfy couches and carpet scenery definitely created a great ambiance. the bartenders were pretty nice in my opinion, and when i made a mistake on an order, she let me go. i guess b/c i was nice, too... ne ways, the main room the night i was there had house music, some good tunes too might i add. only reason i wouldnt give it 5 stars is that the hip hop room was too small! the hip hop room is always too small in many places...shrug"}
{"text":"Looking for a fancy night out? Try Foundation Room. The food is delicious, the service accommodating and friendly, and the ambiance deep, dark, and sexy. Start in the lounge for some unique craft cocktails (try the Night Cap- spirit forward and smooth). Ask for a private room if you want to get extra fancy and avoid the cacophony of the dining floor. Had the diver scallops- perfect sear and tender center. The bone-in rib eye was juicy and flavorful. Take a sip of your Faust Cabernet as you overlook the lights of the Vegas Strip and whisper, \"I am so damn fancy.\" If you're lucky enough to have Barrett as your server, you'll be sure to have a memorable night."}
{"text":"First off, great view. Other than that, it's way too small, especially when they start roping every table off for bottle service only. We got comped a few free drink passes from a worker on the main floor of the casino, they were for champagne or a vodka drink. The Bartender refused to make a vodka drink and would only poor a shot of vodka, not even any ice. We then had to buy mixers for that \"free drink\". DJ was good, crowed was fun, but I most likely won't go back after the bartender thing."}
{"text":"Good food, small portions, and over priced.  I would not pay to be a member too many other good restaurants near by"}
{"text":"I'm a fan for going early in the evening when it's not jam packed with people and you can get a seat on the patio, snuggle with your sweetie and enjoy the gorgeous view of the strip. Later it's just tooooooooo crowded! It used to be members only club back in the day and it was much better then.  If you are new to Vegas this is a great place to grab a drink and enjoy the view! If you like to people watch it can definitely get interesting. You never really know what kind of crowd will be there."}
{"text":"Awesome view, wonderful dinner, great ambience, good drinks! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Called in reservation for my wife's bday. Requested a table with a view. The person who took the reservation was super nice and made special notes. When we arrived they sat us in the middle of the place even tho there were two tables open by the window. Asked politely to be moved which they did. Unfortunately we spent the next 40min (not exaggerating) waiting for a server to take our order. We literally had to waive down a server passing by with a pitcher of water to fill our glasses. Finally my wife asked to leave. We flew in from los angeles for this special night, and this place absolutely killed it. As we were leaving the hostess who sat us didn't remember that she sat us!  Crazy"}
{"text":"Sweet strip view! Nice welcoming staff. Many Asian themed lounges."}
{"text":"I was invited up to the Foundation Room before a Foreigner concert. This was my first time in Cleveland and most certain NOT my last! I loved this place and their very friendly employees....one of the cocktail ladies was so nice she even gave us a VIP pass to her other place of employment. The concert at the House of Blues was AWESOME - and that is where we met a great friend named Vesty....We shared lots of stories and PBR in a can at that show....I will always keep him and Cleveland near and dear to my heart!"}
{"text":"Hhmm..  It was nice. Probably not worth being a member there. Older crowd. (*wink wink* they parttay and ring their tabs in the thousands LOL) Women..go with women, they dont seem to mind or charge if you're all women (this excludes trans).   The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5... SECURITY, PLEASE STOP LETTING THE PROSTITUTES IN!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to take out-of-towners, especially if you know someone with a membership.  The view is spectacular.  A little pricey for food & drinks, but worth it.  Just be prepared for ultimate relaxation in their soft cushy sofas.  Next time, I think I'll go for a private room!"}
{"text":"Hey guys, I absolutely love the Foundation Room! There's no venue that compares!"}
{"text":"Best filet ive had so far. Im not sure it was the age/grade of meat or how it was prepared, but it was outstanding.The service was great, wonderful decor. We thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience."}
{"text":"Had a great time and music was good. We danced country in one room and top 40's in the other. Awesome decor and nice bar staff.   We are in the 40's and 50's age range and it was great for us. None of the oontz oontz music the younger crowd likes."}
{"text":"The Foundation Room is unique, laid back, kinda eerie, kinda exclusive, and should be visited at least once. I have not eaten there yet, only visited the bar. My wife and I asked if we were allowed to look around and got a private tour by a very nice waiter. Each room is decorated differently, and is really something to see. He said a lot of times the headline entertainers will come to the Foundation Room after performing. He also said he thinks the place is haunted. He said at night when they are closed, employees have heard a little girls voice in some of the rooms. Oh yeah, the view from the balcony outside the bar is second to none in Vegas. Being 48 stories up, outside and at the end of the strip, it is a great perspective."}
{"text":"This place is legit! I made a reservation a week in advance for my anniversary dinner and everything was fantastic. We arrived a little early downstairs to check in at the elevators and they confirmed my name on the reservation list and made sure we were dressed appropriately, then notified the hostess so she can seat us after the elevator ride. The lounge/restaurant is on the 63rd floor of Mandalay Bay and once you're up there, you have access to the restaurant and club/lounge. The restaurant is on the pricey side but it's so worth it. The food was great, although small portions, but we had dessert as well so we were good. The service was also great, they tend to you promptly and accommodate special occasions. I also have to mention the view of the strip from up there. It's the best view I've ever had of the strip and I've been in penthouse suites, the High Roller, and the Stratosphere. The lounge has the best view, but you can also get some good pictures right outside the restaurant. After our dinner we went to the lounge where they had a DJ and top 40 music. The crowd was mellow, which was understandable since it was a Monday night. Overall I highly recommend this place if you have a special occasion with your significant other and are willing to splurge a little."}
{"text":"Because there is no ZERO. What a hyped up joke and the view is terrible, JFC, The Mix is right around the corner if you want a view. With all there is to do in FLV, going to the airport home is better than going here."}
{"text":"Great great and great again loved the meal the view but Danny the waiter was the best we loved the place can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"20 years later and still my favorite place to go have a drink and dance, people watch and just plain have fun.  The place is still swank and tasteful with just the right amount of cool factor without appearing to be trying too hard.   Have to credit the Director of Ops, Charo (sp) for helping me with making one of my clients have an incredible evening.  I contacted her and requested that he be given the VIP treatment as my guest (I could not attend) and she was absolutely ON IT.   From the moment he got taken up the private elevator to the end of the evening he was made to feel more important and special than most of us deserve.   Thank you Ms. Ronquillo for going above and beyond.   You truly are a professional!   Looking forward to meeting you in person on my next visit to Vegas to see my old favorite spot.   Gratefully and keep up the great work! Jason S. (Temecula, Ca.)"}
{"text":"The view!!! Wow what a great place to get drunk and chat it up with random fun people  I wouldn't come for the music"}
{"text":"Very cool!  We were treated by Lenovo to an open bar and a tasty array of snacks.  The macaroni and cheese was awesome- it was sprinkled with some sort of bread crumb/parmigiana cheese.  The brisket was tender and succulent, and the slider burgers were yummy too.  The coolest part of the Foundation room was the interior decor.  It may look gaudy to some, but i think it was just right for what they were going for."}
{"text":"It's the House of Blues.  Get passed the velvet roped elevator, sky rocket paste the penthouse and open those doors to the weird east asian looking statues with too many arms etc, and you know its the House, just with lower lighting.   $65 ($55 for members) buys you a 35 day dry aged (not in house), CAB (exclusively pre-Prime inspected like), Bone in, 16 oz Rib Eye steak, grilled to your order... Now I don't know what was weirder, the fact that this 16oz, clearly was mostly beef - because the bone was more like my thumb bone than the L or shank bone I'm used to, OR that because the bone was so small, that I was looking at a 16oz cut of meat that was Chicken Fried steak thickness... well I waste my words, the taste and the mouth experience was one of the best from any griller I've ever had.  If you're ordering the naturally slow dry aged meat, request there be no sauce accompanying it - even if their waiter described \"better than A1\" dressing... or even crusted, even though I love me some blue cheese on some beef... because of this, naturally speaking, grilled correctly, still purplish, that beef's texture is like smooth sashimi, butter knife slicing, only light salt and pepper touched, juicy, invigorating sweetness, to almost pierce your taste buds... and yes that was the meat sections - fat is room temperature butter smooth, taste locked in, the only topping you should have with each bite... I can still taste it.  Don't need support for this experience. Had them, don't remember them because of either the $20 beers per bottle, or the still vivid imagery of that meat. That's what she said.  It's the House of Blues."}
{"text":"Most terrible club/bar ever!!!   Being from miami I've been to my share of clubs.  This was absolutely the most horrible experience I've ever had!   1. The bartenders were standing to the left of the bar twirling their hair, while the lines at the bar built up.  2.  It was 90% 50+ year old men/women.  3.  The belly dancers (if you can call them that because all they did was rub on each other and the wall) were pushing people out of the way.  I'm sorry correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought I was the \"customer\" and they were the \"entertainment\".  How dare they push the guests out of their way with their wreck less idea of dancing?!  4.  Way too many people for such a tiny space!  5. They advertise free champagne for ladies however by the time you get to the bar it's too late!  Horrible horrible experience. Very disappointed in the Las Vegas nightlife. Who wants to wait 1 hr in line to enjoy music and drinks?! Not me!!"}
{"text":"We enjoy this location.  The view of the Las Vegas Strip is really something to view and enjoy.  One of our favorite dishes is the Tempura Cauliflower, yum.  The wait staff is rather nice although there is one waitress that could use a major attitude adjustment.  Would definitely recommend for everyone to try.  Be sure to bring your camera, as I mentioned before, the view of the strip is amazing."}
{"text":"The boilerplate: Not the first to say it and I'm sure I won't be the last but WHAT A VIEW!! Recently coordinated a night out with some work colleagues from out of town. Wanted to avoid the overly crowded nightlife of Friday and Saturday nights so opted for Thursday. It was just as I remembered it WAY back in the day -- but better! The ambiance is elegant but trendy, the music gave the nightlife feel without the feeling of a sardine-packed dance floor,  and the air about the place just really said \"class\".  the rub: The 7 of us camped at one of the nice tables, even though we didn't opt for bottle service. The waitresses and manager came by a few times to make sure we were having a good time and to ensure service, blah, blah... the usual stuff. Inevitably, we were asked to get up --bummer! Being the host, naturally I felt embarassed so I approached the manager from earlier in the night to see about getting a table-- she must've seen the sheer disappointment in my face from knowing my group of gals couldn't imbibe as heavily as getting a bottle would require-- and without any word, she walked me back to my group, escorted us to some private, \"members only\" area, set us up ar another table, and brought us a round of drinks! Genuinely, the nicest gesture in all my times in nightclubs.  Needless to say, I instantly became the COOLEST coworker. Ok, that parts a lie. But seriously, had such an amazing night because of a generous gesture, especially for the girls who've never been to Vegas before! Thank you, Nina (?)-- sorry, music was loud-- for everything!!"}
{"text":"Somehow I always end up at the Foundation Room while visiting Vegas. Located in Mandalay Bar, you take an elevator up to this smaller bar. Make sure to step out onto the balcony where you will take in one of the most beautiful views of the Las Vegas Strip you'll ever see."}
{"text":"Very GOOD restaurant. kind of a guys spot... Don't really know why but it wasn't overly romantic. The steak is is out of this world, get it with the horseradish Parmesan crust. The also have a great short rib app along with their oysters. For dessert try the bread pudding with an espresso!"}
{"text":"**This Review is based on my dining experience** Made dinner reservations  online via OpenTable. Awesome dining experience from start to finish!!. Upon checking in at the reservation desk, we were given access to the  elevator to the restaurant. As soon as we stepped off the elevator, we were greeted by name  by a very warm and friendly host who directed us to the balcony since we were a bit early. The balcony has THE BEST VIEW OF THE STRIp!! It's breathtaking! The restaurant is dimly lit and nicely decorated which gives it a very romantic vibe!   The service was great and the food and cocktails were wonderful. We ordered the swordfish w/ asparagus and potatoes which was cooked and seasoned to perfection. We also ordered the chocolate cake for dessert. I have to say the  dessert portion was quite small however, it tasted very good. I highly recommend Foundation Room for a date night, a special occasion or if you just want an awesome view of Las Vegas and a great meal!"}
{"text":"This place was awful!   Ordered médium rare rack of lamb and it wa well Done, and awful quality so we Ordered Rib eye to replace  it and it was even worse!!  The meat was frozen, and mashed potAtoes were instant, and we still paid $55 for the rib eye!!!  Do not waste your money!!!!"}
{"text":"Top notch!!!  From the moment we went in until the time we left we were not disappointed.  We had VIP bottle service and our service could not have been better.  Great music, and the view..\".the best in Vegas......will definitely return."}
{"text":"The only thing you should be coming here for is the view.  Grab a drink and enjoy the view.  And that's it.  Yea yea, the interior is cool - but not that cool if the entire staff is not friendly, not knowledgeable, and not professional.  Don't even think about eating here, the servers, busboys, food runners, so called \"sommelier\", all have no idea what is going on.  I think they were all on drugs (the incense is probably laced).  Drink menu should be given when you first sit.  Ours wasn't, so the server came and asked what we wanted to drink, then we asked for a drink menu.  10 minutes later it shows up.  We both order ribeye medium rare.  One comes out rare, the other comes out well done.  I can go on but I'll spare your eyeballs.  Like I said, come for the view.  But that's it."}
{"text":"I was impressed upon arrival. Then it was time for a cocktail or not! Two bartenders and we stood there for over 15 minutes never even getting a wave, wink or kiss my arse from the bartender of the manager standing there with her hands in her pockets. Once seated for dinner we finally got a glass of wine. We were a party of 10. I had to ask for bread twice to get any bread at our end of the table. Dinner, a not so tasty salad and two tiny crab cakes, $30! Our entire meal was $140 and we left feeling cheated and hungry. Neat place but overpriced and unimpressive food."}
{"text":"Amazing view!  COVER: $30 according to the website, but I'm not sure what we paid, because the bride-to-be booked in advance.  DRINKS: Because we booked in advance, we had our own tables and alcohol served there. Along with ice water! There were plenty of glasses for our 12+ group. Nice.  AMBIANCE: Zen buddha lounge theme entering the lounge. Pretty empty inside room with bar and plenty of couch seating. Walking pass that we eventually made it outside to experience a fascinate view of the strip. It was not overly crowded. People looked relaxed and enjoying the night. It was rather warm though, being outside and all. Wish there were misting units. The crowd was lacking younger college undergrads, sluts, and creepy grinding-feel-you-up guys - it was more of the young professionals place. Your IQ might even go up here.  OTHER: The manager (or equivalent) was attentive enough to introduce our party to our waitress.   MUSIC: Lots of Top 40 Hits (there was no way to escape \"Moves like Jagger\" in Vegas) and highlights from decades past. The volume was fine where we were.  VISIT DETAILS: Bachelorette party"}
{"text":"I've been to Foundation Room at least 10 times but I had to write a review for Temple Saturdays hosted by Nightlife Guru.  I actually had the pleasure of being a guest DJ in the Temple of Boom room.  So awesome to see a classy joint like Foundation Room support local Electronic Dance Music.  All the previous times I had been to Foundation Room I only knew of one DJ area which is the main area by the bar.  There you typically will hear Top 40 Club music which is perfect for the tourist crowd.  Just outside the main area there is a killer patio that has an amazing view of the Strip from high above the Mandalay Bay.  There is seating out there with bottle service available and it's a great spot to either grab a smoke or have a conversation without having to raise your voice.  But lets face it, I'm loving Temple Saturdays because of the Untz Untz Untz beats they bring.  There is an additional patio area that features some great House Music.  Pat Schoolastra is the resident out there and the man behind Nightlife Guru.  He has been in the game for a long time and knows his House music.  This is real House Music folks which you rarely get to see in a club on the Strip.  The Temple of Boom is the room I was able to guest DJ in and I was stoked to see this room being put to good use.  The music you find in this room is the cutting edge sounds of Electro and Dubstep.  I even had the pleasure of seeing Teenwolf Remix drop some Moombahton here which is the latest EDM genre to hit the scene.  Vegas is becoming the EDM capital of North America and it is nice to see Foundation Room embracing the local talent.  Few other things worth mentioning are all 3 areas have their own bar with reasonably priced drinks.  Also it is smooth entry as long as you're not wearing shorts, flip-flops, baseball caps, or sports attire.  Big props to Nightlife Guru for Temple Saturdays and much love to Foundation Room for giving them a shot."}
{"text":"Some of the best views on the strip can be found at the foundation room. We came here for my wife's birthday party. We had a delicious dinner, great service, terrific wine, and then bottle service and dancing afterwards in the nightclub. You will enjoy yourself, but certainly bring your credit card."}
{"text":"I attended but was refused entry on dress code. I had evacuated the hurricane in Florida and only packed tailored shorts and leather Olukai sandals. My shoes were classier than the doorman's t-shirt. I have never been turned away from a venue before today."}
{"text":"This has always been one of my favorite hangouts seeing as I'm not really into nightclubs and this place is a great place to get some decently priced drinks, dance and enjoy that awesome view. Its always hit or miss at the door though, the employees tend to be a little full of themselves. Edgy House of Blues inspired lounge? It is. Hottest most exclusive club in Las Vegas? It's definitely not. However the employees seem to think so. I was at the casino with some friends and we wanted to stop by and grab a quick drink on our way out. We couldn't though because we were denied entry because the \"bouncer\" didn't like my friend's shoes. I'm all for a dress code, I work on the strip, I get it. But mind you we had just left another club, it was around 2:30am, no line to get in, nothing. I've always loved telling my friends and coworkers about this place, but I think it's time for me to find a new favorite. Las Vegas has no shortage of great music and incredible views, and I'd rather take my money where I'm welcome."}
{"text":"The room and view are very nice but I cannot say the food was exceptional. Good, but not exceptional which it should be at these prices. Nor was the primary server, although her assistant was very good. The steak was good but it might have been choice instead of prime which it should have been at $48. Grouper was very good on a lovely risotto. Caesar salad was excellent but it was ordered with anchovies and without croutons and came just the opposite. Many Las Vegas restaurants filter their tap water to eliminate the chlorine taste, but they did not and I had to order two bottles of still water at an outrageous $10 each. Wine list by the glass was very nice. All in all a decent place but there are many better on the Strip for this kind of money."}
{"text":"Went there first time last week with a few colleagues, one of them was a member. We had a drink at the bar, the bartender was very attentive.  We then went upstairs to the restaurant. All appetizers were really good, esp the chicken lollipops (i think thats what they were called). I ordered the short rib and it was excellent. Others had the prime rib and the steak and were very happy as well. Service was quick and friendly, would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Was in town for the marathon and wife, me and another couple wanted a light supper and drinks in a fun location.  Took advantage of the Lounge extended Happy Hour Nibbles & Sips till 8PM on Monday, 11/13.  Greeted graciously, not very crowded at 6PM.  Drinks were fine, old fashioneds for the guys, $5 wines for the ladies.  The specials menu of mussels, cauliflower Tempura, Korean BBQ and chicken skewers with a ghost pepper dipping sauce were good.    Very nice vibe in the lounge, music not too loud to prevent conversation and waitress was attentive.  We enjoyed it so much the other couple went back after the MICHAEL Jackson One show in the same hotel.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Last night 5/30/10 was our second time having dinner at the HOB Foundation Room. Both times we got the special. Last night it was extra special. We both had the \"Napa Valley Weekend\" a 4 course dinner with wine pairing.  Course 1: Braised Pork Belly with a fennel crust, sweet and spicy turnips paired with Chateau St. Michelle  Course 2: Pan Roasted Langoustine with zucchini and wild mushroom paired with Far Niente Chardonnay.  Course 3: Kobe NY Strip steak with summer artichoke and roasted fingerling potatoes, paired with Frank Family Cabernet Sauvignon  Course 4: Hot fudge cake with key lime sorbet. and paired with Far Niente, Dolce  The only complaint is the last wine pairing. It was way to sweet with the fudge cake. I would suggest maybe a special coffee or choc martini possibly.  The wait staff was excellent. Looch and Ryan  The view is beyond belief from the 42th floor of mandalay bay Hotel"}
{"text":"Can't beat the view up here! Undermined only by the douchey bouncers. Fun outside patio to have a drink at the top of the Strip. Decent beer selection."}
{"text":"Jackson:  I entered the Foundation Room and immediately found a seat in the middle. Surrounded on all sides compounded with the loudness of the noise outside made me feel a bit claustrophobic. Although I was sweating and a bit nervous, I was able to enjoy my stay after needing a few minutes to acclimate. Dismount was difficult due to spaced out walls. Pretty good, but could use some renovations from an expert.  Lewis:  I had quite a good time while i waited for my brother to finish whatever he was working on. The people in the Foundation Room all accepted my presence with open arms, literally hugging me as they left! Jackson finished and i heard the walls groan as he raised up. And so - it was my turn... the warmth of the seat was nice, automatic 4 stars from me! I worked fast and efficient and left just in time to see my brother hugging someone at the exit. These people sure are friendly!"}
{"text":"They'll take your money but only if you're in the finest of dress apparently.  Can't believe a place that claims to be based on the blues would reject people for a guy wearing a nice pair of new Levi's, Timberland shoes and an NFL logo coach's sideline polo.  She was wearing a nice blouse and jeans as well.  When they wouldn't even suggest we bother going to the elevator from the shop where you get your tickets, we wondered why our money wasn't as good as anyone elses.  She literally told us we wouldn't be accepted as we weren't wearing formal attire.  Really?  For the Blues?  And on top of this on a hotel comp?  Then the server has the audacity to ask us if we'd like to dine in the restaurant instead.  Seriously?  So we went to \"The Strip\" steak house, dressed as is, and dropped $250 on dinner there instead.    The dumbass server didn't even get the irony of refusing us service while standing in front of the sign talking about not being able to pay the rent, getting dumped, losing a job.   Enjoy your tour of the blues, if you're good enough.    Signed,   The guy that shopped at the same old Pepper Tree Market on Laurel  and Safeway on San Carlos Avenue as John Lee Hooker when I was a kid.  I'd love to have him back to join me on a trip to this pretentious piece of shit that supposedly honors his legacy."}
{"text":"I usually don't give reviews, but our VIP host Will, was amazing last Saturday! Definitely helped us with what we needed and made the experience at FR memorable. The view is amazing!"}
{"text":"Went up there in the evening one night for drinks only... The view is amazing but after that nothing too great about it.  Very comparable to Ghost Bar."}
{"text":"We found this place by chance on yelp. We rented a room to host a party from 6-10 the service was okay everyone was happy with the food and most importantly my wife was happy.   The view of the city from the balcony was beautiful and great for taking photos and enjoying a few drinks.   The real party starts around 11 and trust me you will not be disappointed. When I say the ladies came out I really mean absolutely gorgeous women came out to entertain and believe me they did not disappoint. The ladies in our group all mentioned how beautiful the girls were and they were all friendly and happy to oblige with photo ops. I must add the entertainment was nothing raunchy but very well done and classy.   This is a must see event and ladies drink free."}
{"text":"AMAZING views and ambiance at this club/restaurant/bar! The prices are on par with Strip prices. I will definitely go back! I would love to be a member to have access to the private rooms!"}
{"text":"Customer service and bouncers here are the absolute worst. Was here for the first stop of my best friends Bachelorette party. Bouncers cursed at us to get the F out of their way (we already were, and we were sober at this point). And they spilled our drinks on myself and the bride 3x! Umm really?!  We are all educated women, most of whom are in the air force. Not some idiots making fools of ourselves. The atmosphere was OK and the view outside was really nice. But after the way we were treated, there's no way we would ever go back here. Plus we were told this was a more relaxed and chill lounge environment. Nope. Just a mini club with the most awful customer service ever. I'm giving this rating two stars because when I told the man who runs the place, he apologized and offered to take care of us for next time."}
{"text":"This was my fourth time at Foundation and it's consistently been great.  Part of the fun is the exclusive elevator ride up and of course the view, but the food isn't anything to sneer at either. Started off with the chicken lolipops and also the pork belly tacos.  The lolipops came with a duo of blue cheese and buffalo sauces. The pork belly tacos came in soft shell corn tortillas (like they should) and had a handful of fixins on them. I got a New York strip with Foundation steak sauce and the lady got a filet with blue cheese.  Both were done nicely. We skipped dessert and hung out on the balcony for a bit.  The views are tough to beat.  Great place to spend your night."}
{"text":"Zen and then some pow - this is a quirky bar in that it has an old asian mens club thing going on. There are private rooms for bottle service or public leather seating around fireplaces for it as well. Music is good but i only like it on occasion. I forget which night is best but once a week its pretty hopping. Mondays? Ask around. I guess they serve apps but I dont remember that. The outside balcony looks over all of vegas."}
{"text":"Daisy K will confirm, I am not one to be thrilled by a membership oriented club, however, the Foundation Room seems to set itself apart from my general disdain of places like this.  The decor is awesome, funky, ecclectic, and perfect for a higher end, rock oriented joint. The artwork is all authentic, which sent me over the edge being an art history major (leaving the art history behind shortly after college however, to make a bit more money!).  Excellent spots for private functions.  Great drinks, great service.  SPECTACULAR views of the strip from the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Nice place to go and check out the view from the balcony at the top of Mandalay Bay.  It's right next to the Mandalay Bay sign so you're up 40 some odd stories so the view is staggering.  I always wonder why I don't come here more often since I'm a member but for some reason, there's so many different places to go in Vegas, I kind of forget about this place.  Maybe it's cuz the crowd is a bit older and it's hit or miss on whether or not it's going off or not...but for whatever reason, I should make it up here more often because whenever I take out-of-towners here, they are pretty amazed.  Btw, food in the dining room is great too.  So, if you know a member (or if you know me) coax them to get you up to this joint.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Really love this place for a cocktail. Super exclusive rooms upstairs all dimly lit. Super plush decor, great drinks, and amazing views. Awesome place to go grab a drink in an upscale environment with upscale people."}
{"text":"This is a very well-executed space.  It's home is the top floor of the Mandalay Bay & the entire layout has a very \"exclusive\" feel to it.  There were not many expenses spared when it was being furnished.  Everything is very modern without feeling like they were attempting to predict the future (which is a feeling I often get in more modernized spaces) & there is an awesome outdoor bar area - in the lounge - that overlooks the Vegas Strip.  The service was excellent, with nobody having to look for attention when they needed something.  The servers were always nearby without being TOO attentive - we were still able to enjoy a fairly private happy hour followed by a similarly private meal.  The dining room we ended up in had huge windows that also overlooked the Strip which made for a nice dinner setting.  The food was excellent as well.  Our party tried the scallops, crab cakes, prime rib, Asian rack of ribs, roasted cauliflower & another dish which I can't remember right now.....and then we finished it all off with bourbon-vanilla gelato for the whole table.  I will most definitely be returning here for another meal next time I find myself in Sin City."}
{"text":"Great food, the filet was amazing Oscar style. Great service and views / ambience. The only complaint is I wish they had a better dessert menu, otherwise this place is fantastic."}
{"text":"Cozy, swanky, and earthy is the best way I could sum up this place. We went here last night after watching the Barrett-Jackson auction for a couple of hours.  We had dinner reservations at another hotel, so couldn't spend too much time, but for the time we were there, we absolutely loved it.   We were there very early about 7:30, the sun had set and the view was incredible. It feels like you are literally sitting inside the city skyline.   There were also a couple of hidden rooms behind the main lounge that we went into. One with a view of the south end of the strip.   We will definately be back in the very near future to relax and indulge."}
{"text":"Without a doubt The Foundation Room has the most spectacular view of the strip.  I haven't had the opportunity to have dinner there but certainly is a great place to hang out and have drinks.  The weekends are crazy with warriors but during the week is chill and definitely is more \"grown up\" then some of the other establishments in Vegas.  If you're in the industry, Monday nights are the nights to go."}
{"text":"Ate there this week with a big group while in LV for a conference. definitely worth the drive down the strip. the view from the patio is incredible and the food was incredible.  I had the sea bass which was cooked well, my only complaint would be that the skin was slightly soggy and not as crisp as expected. One of my friends had the short ribs which were delectable, perfectly cooked and it took a lot of conviction not to steal his plate and eat most of the meal.  I would def recommend a visit for the view and stay for the food."}
{"text":"Definitely feels like a VIP rooftop club. If you get lucky, you might bump into a promoter in the hotel who will give you free tickets to get in. It helps if you have women with you, haha! Once you get on the roof, the inside club is pretty nice, but small. It's worth the trip to go outside on the roof though. You'll be able to see the whole Vegas Strip and enjoy some champagne. Definitely worth the visit just for the view at night!"}
{"text":"We were there Sat evening before the Madonna concert at the MGM across the way.  Classy joint, funky, eclectic decor, very welcoming, relaxing and chic.  I felt right at home there.  The place was dead but according to the bartender, the place doesn't get going until 11p with DJ and dancing.    Surprisingly our drinks were well priced.  We've paid a lot more for the same stuff at other bars along the strip.    5 Stars for the view.  It is truly amazing.  -1 Star for no \"specialty drink\" menu.  Although the bartender was creative with our request it would be nice to have specialties to choose from, especially since professional mixologists do an awesome job at combining unusual and unexpected flavors.  If you go, try to check out the different themed rooms for private dining, partying, etc.  What a superb gem in Vegas and exclusive too.  They only let non-members in on Mondays.    Luckily I was able to get a temporary pass through my credit card for FREE....feeling like a big baller when I'm really not :)"}
{"text":"Do you know why it is awesome being a girl?  Because we get ushered up to places we would have never found on our own.  It was a Monday night, and a few of my girls and I had just finished a nice dinner at Mandalay Bay.  As we are walking through the hotel, someone asks us if we want to go to the Foundation room, and next thing I know, I am up at the top, greeted by the smell of incense and dark décor.  When we walk through the bar area, it was just a bunch of guys holding drinks staring into the small room.  So we walk out onto the patio and we find out that:  The view of the strip is spectacular!  My fear of heights has dissipated at this moment, and I just took in this incredible view of all the lights up the strip.  We also happened to see Dog the Bounty Hunter on the balcony, but that's another story.  We got a few drinks, sat on the nice comfy couches, and took in the scene for a while.  Nice to check out, but not much room for dancing, and it got pretty crowded, even for a Monday."}
{"text":"This place is special. Finally something different than every other sterile tourist trap on the strip. The decor is rich in history and deep in ambiance. The service was second to none. The food was perfect and the wine was wonderful. Best view in Vegas. I will go back and I will stay longer."}
{"text":"I went to the Foundation Room for a wedding reception this past summer and was blown away.  It was a destination wedding and was a smaller crowd of about 40 or so and we had a private area reserved on one side of the balcony.  There was a separate bartender for guests, as well as a DJ spinning for us.  The security was polite but firm with those who tried to wander over to our area.  The inside of the restaurant is richly decorated with an Asian vibe and is beautiful.  The outside balcony needs no decoration because it towers over the strip and provides you with the most magnificent view in all of Vegas.  Seriously, it's amazing.  The restaurant also provided buffet style dinner for all the guests and the manager came out on more than one occasion to make sure that everything was going well.  We had been to the Cat House at the Luxor the night before for a welcome party and I know that the bride had a really bad experience with the management there, so she was extra appreciative of the attentiveness of the staff at the Foundation Room.  I can't speak for the prices of the drinks, since it was open bar for us.  However, if you're looking for cheap drinks, you're better off sticking to a college town than coming to Vegas.  Everything is expensive!  I enjoyed the exclusivity of having our own space at such a fabulous place in Vegas and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to have a classy wedding in Vegas, or an upscale bachelor/bachelorette party with a bunch of friends.  I added some pictures on here, but you're dying to see more, you can do so here: http://bit.ly/chhqTs"}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance. .. Food was ok Shrimp and Grit. My husband had short ribs Very Good! When I got my check there was drinks I never even consumed :/ he said \"sorry wrong table\" not true because it was exactly what we ate and cocktails we had but he added other drinks in there. Great view very expensive but worth the experience"}
{"text":"$35 for really really bad tacos on stale tortillas....the actual room the restaurant was in was cool, but this food was crap.  I was so upset about this because I could have gone to any nice restaurant in a town full of them but wasted a meal on this garbage."}
{"text":"Great place!  Love the decor, the amazing view down the strip and for once a place with reasonable music.  I was here as part of a conference so I honestly don't know what the process is to get in otherwise but if you're in Vegas and looking for a great view and a really funky atmosphere this is the place to go."}
{"text":"If it is supposed to be locals night on monday don't ask me for cover. Its an alright lounge but I am not paying cover for the right to purchase over priced drinks. I left they can keep their liquor on the shelves  I have been there before its a nice view but not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"What a great dining experience! We originally had reservations for the dining room, but decided to eat in the lounge instead. The view is amazing!! More importantly though - the wait staff/bar staff were extremely friendly, helpful with questions, and attentive. Service was near impeccable (with the exception of one female bartender who seemed a bit clueless). The ambiance was great  - music volume perfect, seating was comfortable, and there was much to look at all around. We ordered some food from the happy hour menu and some from the regular menu. Everything was delicious! The venue is so unique, it would be nice to see a menu reflective of that - maybe some choices that are unique and different, but regardless, everything was tasty. Would definitely return and would recommend to all of our friends!"}
{"text":"So amazing!  The service was incredibly attentive and personal - every suggestion was spot on.  We ordered:  \"Twice Cooked\" Mediterranean Baby Octopus with Crispy Potatoes Rosti, Marinated Radish Salad and Herb Shallot Vinaigrette - Highly recommended!    Baby Arugula Green Salad with \"Fried\" Gorgonzola Toasted Walnut Cheese, Marinated Cipollini Onions, and Crisped Parma Prosciutto - I'm not a fan of the fried gorgonzola as it's not my thing, but the balsamic cipollini onions were so flavorful and deliciously (not nauseatingly) sweet.  Chicken Flatbread - Tasty but way too much carbs for me, I'd like to try the duck breast next time.  Pinot Noir Mac Murray - a nice value wine. Not tannic and very smooth.  \"ChocoFlan\" - Espresso/Cocoa Cake with Silky Caramel Vanilla Flan and Toasted Hazelnut Nougatine - The Nougatine was the perfect foil to the soft flan texture.  Um yeah, needless to say, I need to hit the gym.  HARD."}
{"text":"One of the BF's friends in Vegas was able to get us on this list for this amazing lounge. If you have the chance to hang out in the Foundation Room, go! It's an amazing experience.   For me, the atmosphere of this place is what puts it over the top. The entire lounge has a very sophisticated Asian theme. The walls are upholstered in red and orange patches of mirrored Indian fabric. The doors are heavily carved and you'll see Buddhas here and there. The couches and chairs also provide comfortable places to hang out. The balcony offers an amazing view of the strip.   The DJ was very good the night we were there. She played great music and kept the volume loud enough to keep the party going without making it so loud that you couldn't talk to the people around you.   Surprisingly, the drinks are reasonably priced for a lounge like this. The bartender also remembered what all four folks in my party were drinking. I am sure she was thrilled we drank round after round between our arrival around 11:00 PM and when the joint closed down at 3:00 AM. I agree with others that it was a bit odd this place didn't have a speciality drink menu.   Overall, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Food was alright, not worth the cost. The view was nice. Drinks were also alright. I would recommend you instead go somewhere else for better food and have a more delicious drink and view at skyfall  at at the Delano. Service was great though. View was better at skyfall bar and probably at the rivea restaurant. If I could do it all over again I'd just do rivea and skyfall. Decorations were really cool though. I think the club at night would be cool to check out."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!  Amazing service!!  Always a fan favorite!! I had the lamb. Someone had the scallops. Someone had the halibut. And someone had the filet. All was amazing!!! Staff was awesome. Luche and the server was great!  Answered all our questions. Put up with our antics. Offered great suggestions!!"}
{"text":"We came here for a Lenovo convention welcome reception.  The open bar was incredible with any choice of drinks we wanted.  The Buffet spread was also really well executed and delicious.  The only mild complaint was it was very warm, not sure if was because the outside doors were opening and closing or ac was on the fritz.  I'd go back for another party though, the view was amazing!!"}
{"text":"The best part of going to Foundation Room is the SPECTACULAR VIEW of the Las Vegas strip!!! That would be a perfect spot to propose your woman too! Am I right?!   I went here to a friend of a friend's birthday and she had her own separate room with bottle service and its wow! The decor is beautiful. I can't really recall how the music is - I was mostly drinking and socializing. I still had a great time."}
{"text":"This place has a great view, but the service is horrendous!!! The redhead bartender on a Saturday literally said \"why are you looking at me\".  Ummmmm because you're the frickin bartender and I need a drink!!!!! She is bitter and needs some customer service training!!! She didn't even give me the right drink! She's awful! Don't get into the service industry if you're angry at life.  Wouldn't recommend this place.  Gave one star because I have to rate.  I give her a -5."}
{"text":"Don't do it! After paying a $400 \"entrance fee\" to see fireworks on New Years Eve, we were harassed terribly. Our fun New Years made a disturbing turn when they gladly took our money and told us it was for viewing fireworks, then we were constantly bullied by security telling us that we had to move or go somewhere else. No management was available to talk to. There also was no reason for constantly moving us. This was miserable and we were made to feel badly by their staff. Don't give them your money!"}
{"text":"Always a good time at this place. Thursday night is a little more mellow than usual but it works out perfect ! Can't beat the view of the Las Vegas strip .!  Start your night here you won't regret it ! Shout out to my boy JP for hookin up the table"}
{"text":"When baiting clients, no trick is too low.  At the door I asked the bouncer if there was any people up there. He said it was but it would cost me $20. Seeing no line whatsoever I was hesitant but went along. When I got up the place was dead, 10 min later they close down because it's so slow.  I'll admit that the decor and view is good but a club that hustles clients can never get more than a 1*."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time this past weekend (my parents are members), and I had an absolutely fantastic time! Our waitress was amazing, the food come out in a very timely manner and it was delicious. The after we ate upstairs, we went downstairs and had a few cocktails before the Cavs game. I love the overall atmosphere of the place - I read in another review that said the decor reminded them of a hookah bar, and I can def see that in how the place is decorated. I just cannot say enough about how great the staff is that works there. The mystery of trying to find it is pretty cool too - I would not have been able to find the place on my own if I wasn't with my parents. Great job! I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"We had reservations at 7:15 and they knew we had tickets to a show at 9:00. We arrived early to see if we could get seated early. We finally left at 7:50 because we still had not been seated. They kept promising they would get us seated. Ridiculous. Will never go back."}
{"text":"What Steven G. says!!! They suck (except for the great waitress!) I'm still fighting my credit card charge with them! Justice will triumph!!!"}
{"text":"THE best view in Vegas!  Friendly staff, good people, all smiles, but the view, oh, that view!"}
{"text":"I came here last Saturday 1/31/15, had the best time. Truly one of the best views in Vegas on that balcony. Everyone was super friendly - from the bartenders to security, even the bathroom attendant was a total doll! I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"It's worth a look just to see the view from the terrace and the over-the-top decor.  I'd like to come here wearing a Members Only jacket just to bask in the irony."}
{"text":"Every once in a while you accidently find a hidden gem by accident. The foundation room was just that. While at Mandelay Bay to eat at the burger bar we were redirected to check out the foundation room after asking for directions out of the Casino. On the 40th floor the Foundation room can only be described as posche. From the cool Asian artifacts to the amazing view of the strip the foundation room has upsacle eligance down. For dinner I had the Filet with blue cheese topping. The steak here was cooked to prefection. I can honestly say it was one of the best i have ever had. For dessert I had the ice cream samplers. They were all homemade and very good. Portion sizes here were good also except I felt the ice cream was small for the price. The table service was top notch. I really appreciated not being rushed through dinner. Over all one of the best dinning experiances I have had."}
{"text":"This place has really got to be upgraded. It's disgusting inside... it smells like a combination of sweat and incense sticks/hookah. This could be a really great, hip area, but I just felt as though I was sitting on people's discharge, dried sugary drinks, and sweat. The drinks were basic, nothing special and something I could get at any other bar in Vegas.   It also seemed to me that this was a perception among many people there- as they came up, get a drink (because they feel obligated to), take some pictures of the view, and then leave."}
{"text":"First off, understand that when I go out I want to dance not just \"chill\" or \"hang\" or whatever... so knowing that, read the rest  I feel like the foundation room is filled with people who couldn't get into Ghostbar.  The view is rad, and we got there around midnight with no line whatsoever.  I enjoyed sitting on the patio, people watching, but kinda wanted to move on to the next club, which was PURE... and was filled with dancing people.    Three stars for strong drinks and a good view, and three stars for lack of fun things to do besides make fun of d-bags hanging out looking for trainwrecks."}
{"text":"Our wedding took place at the HOB Foudation Room on 6/26/16 and it could not have turned out any better. Kelly was so easy going and professional to work with for both ceremony and reception. Very punctual with emails and returning phone calls, and made sure everything went smoothly. Mike and Ryan assisted the day of the wedding and were so helpful and on top of things. The food provided by FR was amazing, so there is no need to look for outside catering; Our wedding guest were blown away by the food and it's quality, defiantly not your typical wedding buffet style meal. We can not say enough about our wedding day experience with both Kelly and the FR; and I don't want to leave out the fact that the staff members were great as well. A unconventional option worth checking out for a wedding. Superb!!!   I could say so much more about this beautiful artsy location, but just that everything was amazing and worth every penny!!!"}
{"text":"What a view from the patio! That's what makes the $10 drinks tolerable.  A little weird dancing on carpet with heels on... but it works. The decor is so cool and eclectic. Tons to look at.  Great music playing and videos above the bar. I was having 90s flashbacks. Did you notice to private lockers for celebrities near the elevators. Very cool."}
{"text":"I called and booked a reservation for The Foundation Room and spoke to a gentleman. I specifically stated I am not a member of the foundation room but asked if I can still eat there for restaurant week.  The gentleman stated no problem because it's restaurant week. He confirmed the reservation for 6:30. When I arrived at 6:27 I was greeted by a woman who stated she could not find my reservation. I explained I just made the reservation earlier that day and maybe it wasn't in their system yet. I then explained I made the reservation with a gentleman and asked if she could check with someone. She advised she doesn't know who I'm talking about. I asked if I could go upstairs and speak with someone as there must be a mistake. She said no!   I can't believe the incompetence displayed by this business. It was a truly disappointing experience."}
{"text":"The Foundation Room has a funky oriental decor and the ambiance is a little dark and mysterious. The view outside is breathtaking. The crowd is on the older side - I would say half of them are in their late 30's and early 40's. If you are in your early 20's this place is probably not for you. It's definitely worth checking out once in your life time - you'll have to decide yourself if you want to return."}
{"text":"As a frequent visitor of Vegas, I never really visit the Mandalay Bay due to its far location at the end of the Strip. This past Valentine my boyfriend and I went to dine and hang at Mandalays on a Sunday evening, a change from the typical Cosmo/Aria scene. The promoter from the Foundation room stopped us and handed us drink/entry passes in the casino. Another guy walked us into the lounge/club located all the way near the top of the hotel (but below MIX) I think? Don't really know which floor.. I was buzzed.   Anyway, it was a pleasant surprise! The antique furniture gave a very classy/vintage vibe. Bar had a good variety of specialty drinks and wine selection. Bartender had excellent etiquette, came over and lit me up when she saw me pull out my Mild 7s :) DJ was spinning old school hip hop with top 40 mix. Surprisingly, I was not bored. Most likely I was amused by the spectacular view of the Strip from the balcony and the drunk gay guy prancing/cat-walkin' around the dancefloor all night to every single song.  I would definitely take my friends here on future Vegas trips."}
{"text":"This place has the best views! We were on the list for the lounge and stopped by after a show. It was really empty inside except in the patio where everyone was enjoying the view. We didn't stay long but it was definitely worth it to take pictures and get away from the crowds for a bit."}
{"text":"This place has a GREAT view. This Lobster Tail special was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Couldn't recommend it enough. Also got sides of mac and cheese and mashed potatoes which were just okay. Server was semi good... she didn't come around a lot and was a little slow. Overall still 5 stars and I will be back."}
{"text":"There are really only two things you need to know about the Foundation Room:  1. It's on the roof of Mandalay Bay, and has an EXCELLENT view of the Strip. 2. Scantily clad dancers - in bustiers, fishnets, cheekie panties & heels. HEAVENLY.  The drinks were pretty good, too. The bartenders were friendly and quick, and a bit heavy handed.   All in all, it's a pretty place!"}
{"text":"We were guests of a company party hosted at the Foundation Room. If you want a place to impress this is definitely it. Awesome balcony and view! Really memorable. The bar service was good. The catered food was average. The lounge was pretty sexy. Worth the trip.  Food: 3/5 (catered, buffet apps) Drink: 4/5 - Selection not the best Venue: 5/5"}
{"text":"Door Hosts are very, very rude. I came to the door wearing black dress shorts (when it was 105 outside) and a dress shirt and was denied entry, yet several girls walked right in wearing ugly jean shorts and T-shirts. When I mentioned it, the door host became loud and said to shut up. The crowd is nasty and the place has slowly gone down hill over the last 10 years.  I understand that in NV the casinos are allowed to discriminate and treat people poorly, but this guy took it to another level. If you are a local, don't patronize this place. They don't deserve it."}
{"text":"I love me some Foundation Room. Literally, the last three times I have gone to Vegas I have made it a point to pop into the Foundation Room. Two of the times were for cocktails, views of the strip, and some dancing. I love the lounge feel and that there isn't a million people packed into one room. Much more enjoyable!  The most recent time was for dinner with one of their members. Wow, talk about the perks of being a member! The VIP lounges and event space is absolutely gorgeous! Not to mention the top notch service!  For dinner, the two highlights for me were the fried cauliflower and the Korean buns. Holy smokes! I am salivating just thinking about them. I think during the course of dinner, we managed to order each item three different times because they were THAT good. I have even ordered fried cauliflower at other restaurants hoping for a piece of the same deliciousness, but no one has it down like the Foundation Room!"}
{"text":"I've contacted Sasha/business rep per her reply to my review. I've recd no response. At this point there's no point to discuss anything further."}
{"text":"Nice place, reservations was simple, getting seated was fast, great menu selection, after dinner party had great vibes.....easy to order drinks and have a cigar and the view was killer.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Sweet spot on top of the strip.  Swanky, dark, funky decor and people watching makes this a fun spot.  Definitely recommend as a must see in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Was here for UFC fight night and the place did not disappoint! Great customer service from attentive staff and the food was perfect. Decent wine selection and the good mixology skills made for a perfect Ild Fashioned drink!  Very nice decor inside with high tops and couches to sit at while you enjoy the food and drink.  Outside there were strong heaters (outside in March can get chilly) and more comfy couches to relax and converse with friends or meet new people.   Great experience!!"}
{"text":"This place is not special at all.  How it's members only?  I don't know.  Initially you're greeted with the lounge area that feels like some private party, not a happening scene.  The saving grace of the place is having a drink with a view of the strip.  The food was okay.  The lobster salad for $18 was HORRIBLE.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"My experience was not what I expected food took over 35 minutes to come out when it finally did rack of lamb was raw and fatty. It was a huge let down we sent the lamb back twice it felt as if we were an inconvenience to the staff ."}
{"text":"We visit the Foundation room every time were in Vegas.(about twice a year) Favorite place out there! Otto the waiter that we request is great. Like family. Place is a must!"}
{"text":"excellent.....all around atmosphere is amazing. service 5 stars. Recommend to all. The views are breathtaking"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. We were looking for a high end option to celebrate our 2 birthdays. First, service was extremely slow even though the restaurant was only about half full. Hoping that the food would make up for the slow service but no.  Started with the Seared Jumbo Shrimp. Nothing jumbo about it. Just 2 small shrimp. No value for $21. The Cajun lemon beurre blanc that the shrimp were presented in was excellent. Unfortunately the best part of the meal.  First entree Skuna Bay Salmon, over cooked, dry and fishy. At 40 bucks a pop save your money. Second entree Pan Seared Diver Scallops, better, but not by much. These too were over prepared.  Bottom line, my wife and I don't have problem spending money on dining out, and we even expect to pay a little more considering the venue. But, if your going to charge me a $170 out the door, please make it a dinner worth eating."}
{"text":"So it's Monday night, our last night in Vegas. The hotel had begged us with offers to come and visit the Foundation Room on the 63rd floor, 'Vegas's longest running nightclub.'. Brayden, a gentleman near the elevators and casino floor accosted us a twice since we had been staying at the hotel (Mandalay Bay).  We were given these tickets for free cover before midnight and also a free cocktail.  We get there just a few minutes before midnight and take the elevator up to the top.  Getting off we approach the bar, show our drink tickets and were refused... it was only a few minutes after and the elevator ride took a minute. Gee wiz!  After the disappointment with the bar, we went outside to see the view.  Oh and what a view!  Very much worth the ride up.  We snapped some photos and vibed with the music a little.  We went back inside to dance and the place was almost a ghost town.  I get that it's a Monday but the place was empty!  We stayed a little, danced by ourselves in the aisle near the bar and left as they were closing just before 1am.   Cool vibe, neat place, great views- too bad no people!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place because we are Club Corp members. Saturday night, made our reservations and came for dinner and drinks. View was amazing.   Everything was going well, hanging out at the members only lounge until one of the hostess kicked us out of the club around 10:30pm because she saw my fiancee \"stumbling.\" The only drink she's had was the bubbly drink they gave us a stub for. Mind you, she was wearing heels. It is very dark inside and floors may have been slippery, but we were not given a chance to explain.   It was a very humiliating experience getting kicked out and calling her intoxicated in front of my guests whom I had invited because we are Club Corp members. I have been to several private clubs & country clubs affiliated with Club Corp and we have never been kicked out and treated this way. It may have been because it's Vegas? Maybe it was getting crowded? But they have to work on their hospitality.   The night was an extreme disappointment  for my fiancee and called it a night with our guests around 11:00pm as we only planned on hanging out at Foundation Room that night because of our membership affiliation with them."}
{"text":"First and foremost let me say that the Mandalay Bay hotel is AMAZING and their guest services were fantastic, beautiful hotel and I would definitely stay there again. On the other hand, I didn't have the greatest experience when i came to their 'night life'   Two of my girlfriends and I were making our way through the Casino to get to the tram because we had a couple places to go meet some people at over in NY NY. A man approached us with those free admission cards to get into the Foundation room. We for sure wanted to check it out, so we told him we would come back later because we needed to go somewhere else first. He was super nice and said he'd be there the rest of the night and to come find him when we want to get in. So.. we did, we left ROK over at the New York, which was pretty fun - and made our way back to Mandalay. Found the guy and he walked us to the door man and said 'have fun!' well, the door man - his name is Demitri, didn't even look up to smile he just asked for our ID's and 10$ ... it was about 12:30am by this time. I'm not a pre madonna but i'm also not going to pay 10$ at midnight when i left the club i was at before where i got in free. You ladies know how great it is in Vegas cause everywhere is free.. so we went back to find our guy and he walked us up to the door assuring Demitri it was OK that we get in for free. Demitri went off - telling us that no one is getting commission for the 3 of us to get in, and throwing it in our faces making it seem like we're robbing this guys job. I looked at the other guy who had been helping us and he was SO nice and again, assured Demitri it was OK for us to get in and he didn't care. I wish i could have gotten the nice guys name, but i was sure to get Demitri's on my way out because that is no way to treat people, especially ones who are paying a lot of money to stay at their hotel AND on alcohol once we got up there.   Fortunately the view was worth the harassment but i can't say i'll ever recommend someone to go there unless they want the door man to put up a fight with them or pay to get in when you can get in for free pretty much anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Best view of the strip. Coolest little new mega casino bar around. Great big drinks and hotties all over.   Somehow here I don't feel sleazy talkin' to cougars from Wisconsin. It feels oh so right."}
{"text":"The Foundation Room is the club/lounge on the top of the Mandalay Bay hotel.  This location provides probably one of if not the best views of the Vegas strip in all of its glory.    If you want to have one of those Tony Montana moments where you gaze at the sky and realize that the \"world is yours\" then all you need to do is go to the Foundation room and gaze below at the Vegas Strip.    Once you are through soaking it in, the Foundation room can be a pretty happening place depending on the day.  We were lucky enough to be invited to a vendor party in a private room that was absolutely beserk and spilled over into the main room once the event ended.    They normally do not charge cover here so if you are at the Mandalay it is definitely worth checking out the view at least and sticking around if the scene is good."}
{"text":"Went to Foundation on a Sunday night and it was  a good time. Everyone was dressed to impress and there were definitely a handful of very beautiful people there. Ages ranged from mid-20's to early 40's. The DJ played a good mix (edm and hip hop). We came at a good time (around 11) and were able to nab a table and couch outside on the balcony. Sweet! If you're staying at Mandalay come up to Foundation for the view and intimate nightlife. :)"}
{"text":"This place charged us a $20 cover, then didn't let us in and kept our $20..  I've been ripped off it Vegas plenty of times. But never by a place in high end hotel. Pretty much we show up cause they have ppl handing out their free pass 2 free drink passes. Of course once you get there it's free for women, drinks stop at 12 passes! I kept telling the girls with us the $20 cover for men it's worth it.. the floor guy tells us that he wouldn't lie and it's live up there.  Well I don't know if he lied or not cause security found a vape pen on 1 of us. So he didn't want to let us in and said since we cross the rope entrance that was considered admission for men. Then kept the $20 cover!   In my previous experience any company that does shady business like this obvious has terrible quality and isn't worth go to."}
{"text":"This review is for the RESTAURANT portion of the Foundation Room.  I came here several nights ago for dinner, and it was ok, nothing great. The food isn't bad, but compared to the price, it's not worth it. I guess if you want a quieter place to dine, and you're a member, then sure, it's ok.  I ordered the horseradish crusted, rib-eye steak. Again, it was good, but not great. I would have much rather have had a steak from Mesa Grill.  For sides we ordered the mashed potatoes, and something else, which I can't even remember, that's how insignificant it was.  The service and ambiance are great though. As everyone has pointed out, the view is spectacular. I'd come back for drinks at this particular Foundation Room, and skip the restaurant. Come to think of it, you can just go to Mix, at THE Hotel for drinks and an even better view.  Food: 2 Ambience: 5 Service: 5 Value: 2"}
{"text":"The ladies and I came here for some bachelorette celebrating on Saturday night at 11:30pm. A coworker of ours put us on the guest list, so not sure how hard/expensive that would have been to get in. I was a little put off at first by the crowd... wasn't expecting an older, 40ish type crowd, and the area seemed small since there were a few private tables/sections that took up half the space. The view from the balcony was amazing, but too cold for us to stay out there to hang out. Claudeen worked her charm and we were able to walk around and get a tour of the back/VIP rooms thanks also to our boy Ralph. During the tour, we proceeded to meet some friendly brothers and their friends that just wanted to dance and have fun. So of course, we obliged and had a great time... lots of hilarious pictures ensued. We also randomly met Dean Roland from Collective Soul, nice guy and his friends were funny and just enjoying themselves. Unfortunately, I'm not a social butterfly, so I couldn't keep up.  The other nice thing was that the place was carpeted, so wearing heels all night wasn't as painful with the padding. Music was okay, we usually prefer hip hop, but we had a great time either way and got to request a few songs. Most of the guys we met that night were super nice and gentlemenly. I noticed though it seemed like there were more guys than girls. And at least it didn't feel like they were staring. Luckily also, our bachelorette didn't get too weirded out with all the crazy stuff we made her do with them. =P We even had a few cuties help us pick our club for the next night too. Too bad they didn't join us, though. ;)"}
{"text":"Very nice, great view and server I think her name was Kelly, nice blonde woman....was very nice.  Enjoyed some nice wine and cheese, the view, relaxation and the soft romantic music from about 6pm till 11, then music turns tekno for a dance club, didn't really get that so left.  Enjoyed entire experience before the new music at 11."}
{"text":"Visited last week, and was disappointed. The bar is really small. There is music but no dance floor to speak of and almost all the seating is outdoors (it was well over 95 degrees that night) and pretty much all of the seating indoors is reserved for bottle service. I have been to similar places before but zero seating? It didn't feel very exclusive and the environment was not very festive. We left and went downstairs to one of the open bars where there was plenty of seating and a dance floor and good musicians. I say if you're going to charge a premium and extra for drinks you need more that a great view to make it feel like an exclusive and special experience."}
{"text":"My steak was PERFECT, my sides were PERFECT.  Service was great, balcony was a greta time, dance floor and crowd was a ton of fun.  If you can get in, you should have a good time.  Grab a Cigar from the small humidor too!"}
{"text":"This place was a secret little hideaway. There were statues. Inside there were oversized chairs around the fireplace. There were a couple hidden rooms. The balcony provided a nice view. There was a bar. Very quiet and subtle and fun."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's one of my favorite spots in town.   The food is delicious, with an ever-changing menu; the service is top-notch; the clientele are classy; and the view of the strip is one of the best in Vegas.  The experience truly can't be beat."}
{"text":"Last February, my then girlfriend and I came to Vegas on a Valentine's Day excursion. Our first stop on the first night was the Foundation Room. We went into Mandalay Bay, and were directed into an elevator to the top, where this lounge is located. A former co-worker from Cedars Sinai told me about this place and it's spectacular view. She was not kidding, and I was impressed by what I saw. Check out the pic for the view. The drinks were pretty strong, so I tipped very well in appreciation. The crowd was ok, but not as popping as other Vegas joints. No worries, however, as we were a bit tired from the five hour drive. The indoor portion was ok, it had good music playing and some people dancing. The outside area was better, as I enjoyed the cool fresh air, and the spectacular view. The lighting was pretty good, too, and made for some memorable photos. If you're looking for fast tempo, head elsewhere. For a chill time, come check this place out."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, they were hosting the after party for Local Brews, Local Grooves. Was instantly rushed by a promoter into the VIP entrance for free, with 3 free drink tickets and put on a fast elevator to the top of the world. The second I got up there the security and staff were all smiles and very helpful. Clean bathrooms and sweet attendants. Bar tender would make double drinks in the exchange for 2 tickets and they were very nice. I find that most bartenders just try to get through each transaction fast to move on to the next, but here there is a large bar so you do not have to wait and the girls have time to smile and thank you. There were some fun dancy gypsy girls that were very mysterious and would dance around the ENTIRE club, with changing glow balls... it was all very entertaining. There is deff an elegant, indian culture vibe. The music was great, current and 90s pop hop, was great.  now.....  THE VIEW!  Even if you dont want to go to dance and simply just want to grab a cocktail and see the city, this is the place.  Manadalay Bay is home to the best views of the Las Vegas Strip.  Seriously, the view.  Do you believe me yet? GO SEE IT."}
{"text":"Great view, awesome service and one of the most unique night clubs and restaurants in Vegas! The view is a must see!"}
{"text":"I will give the disclosure that I'm not a \"clubber\" but I went with a bunch of girlfriends who were really excited about trying out a club in Vegas. The ambiance is pretty cool and the hosts hanging around Mandalay Bay are very nice and eager to offer free drink tickets to young women. We used our tickets but it was uncomfortably crowded and there is literally nowhere to sit. The men in the club were mostly with other women or were much older (like in their 50s). Our group is about 27 and while we enjoyed the music and the views it was just too much. Bottom line: if you like crowed spaces and dancing this is a fun experience, especially if you are a lady and want the free vodka drinks. If you want to be able to rest at all I'd recommend somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went there for an event and I really enjoyed it! Very sultry bar/lounge.  Passed appetizers and open bar. Extremely sultry and very sexy is the decor.  Amazing view of the strip as well as the city.  Dancers entertain you while you enjoy your evening."}
{"text":"A true five star experience!  The prefect blend of elegance, exclusivity and hospitality.   I recently had the opportunity to dine on a slower Thursday night in one of their private dining rooms. Every aspect of the experience was high quality.   I wholeheartedly recommend taking advantage of any opportunity you may have to visit in the future."}
{"text":"One of the best views in the city! Great drinks awesome food come check it out no membership needed in vegas"}
{"text":"Blood, drinks and a Tetanus Shot!!!!  We went to the Foundation Room on Friday the 17th is October for a Neyo Concert After Party.  We got a round of drinks and headed to the balcony to check out the view.  Just as we stepped in to the balcony I got stuck in the foot with something and grabbed my husband.  It was a piece of broken glass that's cut my foot.  Ouch.  I looked down at my feet it was blood all over my sandals.  A bouncer popped up out of nowhere and checked me.  He called for a \"Medic\" on his headset.  He had to call 2 more times for the \"Medic\" bye that time it was blood dripping on the floor.  The medic came took my over to a take a seat.  Bless his soul he wasn't prepared for the amount of blood that my foot was dripping.  He had one bandaid, a thing of saline, and a pack of gauze.  The \"Medic's\"hand was shaking.  I looked at my best friend who is in the medical field to care for my wound.  She pressed on my food to stop the bleeding and to make sure it wasn't any glass in my foot.  She told Bouncer with Gloves, sorry I meant to say the \"Medic\" to get more gauze and more bandaids.  She cleaned the wound with the saline and bandaged me up.   The Medic got us a round of drinks for the inconvenience but never filled out a incident report.  Later that evening we stopped at our hotels security to get more band aids and gauze because the wound was oozing.  They asked us why we never took pics or had a incident report filled out.  To be honest we didn't think about it.  My foot hurt and was sore for the rest of our visit which totally sucks since you have to walk a mile inmost hotels in Vegas just to get a coffee.   Now that I am home I was still having issues with my foot so I went to my Dr.  she cleaned the wound which does look like it was getting infected, she gave me antibiotics and a lovely tetanus shot!!!    She asked me why I didn't take pictures of the glass, my foot when it happened and all the blood and my answer was it was all just a accident by irresponsible drinks. They dropped their glass and never told security to clean it up.  The other reason was we were more concerned with stopping the bleeding.  My girlfriends husband was feeling faint since he doesn't do well with blood.  The bleeding was so bad that the white on my sandals were covered in blood.   The bouncers were really nice even though they never filled out a incident report."}
{"text":"The music and ambiance amazing. Very professional crowd. Yet super guy heavy. View is super nice. Also in the other tower is mix similar view just different more casual layout."}
{"text":"Come for some relaxed fun and outdoor views. This place is a little hidden gem and worth taking a look.  Promoters hand out free passes out side the club so take a chance"}
{"text":"The security staff is really pretentious and kind of aggressive. I guess they have something that's called VIP restroom break where they escort folks from A to B without giving a shit about pushing or even assaulting other guests! Happened on Saturday and one of the folks in my group got a very nice bruise from security member grabbing and pushing her aside! Fucked up place!"}
{"text":"A great venue.   What bothers me about many so-called exclusive clubs is the pretentious staff.   The Foundation Room is a breath of fresh air. From the elevator enterance the staff is classy and professional, not typical vthey are very well dressed and take their jobs seriously without coming across as pretentious d-bags.   Once you get up to the 43rd floor, the staff welcomes you. Everyone is great.   The view us amazing. The decor is reminiscent of a Bordello.    The clientele was diverse, but the majority seemed to be of the Jersey Shore variety.   Not my preferred crowd, but the staff and view alone make me a fan!  I'll have to check out the one at home."}
{"text":"Had a corporate dinner there 2 nights ago. 12 people. Two stars regarding food and table service.  Appetizers were good. Ordered rib eye and it was shite.  All fat and gristle with very little meat.   Short ribs were raved about at our table by a couple of people that ordered them.  They got one persons order wrong and he had to watch us eat while waiting for his NY strip.  Service was not too good.  It was relatively quiet there yet our glasses lay empty for 15-20 minutes before we flagged someone down to order more.  Unacceptable for us raging alcoholics.  Good atmosphere, booze and people watching if that's all you want.  Won't be back very soon for a meal. ."}
{"text":"Here for a special dinner, since my wife and daughter had been before.  Not always available to non-members, it's definitely worth a request to get reservations. This was one of the best dinner experiences we have had anywhere.  Before dinner happy hour drinks on porch overlooking the strip - best view anywhere, and great drinks and apps.  Bar inside is clubby feeling, cosy and comfortable.  Dinner room is quiet, classy, and not crowded.  Service was great, with just enough good advice, attention, and courtesy. Four of us had ...lamb shanks (outstanding, with good spice and falling off bone), chicken (tender and tasty), and grouper dish (very nice). Everything was wonderful, highlighted by great selection of reasonably-priced wines by the glass.  Finished with dessert (we had not planned to do, but...), selection of three fresh cookies and scoop of gelato, that was terrific.  I would always try to get back here if in town again; worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Our experience at the foundation was very disappointing. The waitress was rude, the food was very over priced. The room was dark and overbearing. The only good thing was the view."}
{"text":"I believe this is one of the greatest places on the strip. The balcony view is amazing, the staff are great, and the decor is fabulous."}
{"text":"If you are a guy, this place is amazing. There are two girls that dance the whole time in almost nothing and they have bodies that would make playboy models jealous! Drinks are average $10 but what can u expect for a place u need to know the right person to get into! The outdoor patio is awesome and offers a great view of vegas."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place, went there last night. It was packed for Labor Day weekend. So fun, I don't know if every weekend  they do this blackout light thing but it was awesome. Never been before, but it was clear this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Appetizers and drinks on the balcony is a must-do!  The view is great.  Dinner is good. Steaks are adequate.  The lamb chops are tender and tasty. Bacon-wrapped shrimp are terrific. Shrimp and grits are quite good as well.  Sides are big enough to share."}
{"text":"First of all we were on a club tour and had to wait like 45 minutes to get in here when there was like no one inside because of the \"fight\". Then we finally get in and are having fun For my nieces bachelorette party. Then a guy with bottle service was leaving and tried to give us the rest of his Grey Goose bottle which was super cool EXCEPT for when the lame ass bouncer told us he couldn't and then wouldn't even let us go finish it with him. WTF!!"}
{"text":"My review is of the restaurant. The food is pretty good. It's and solid, but not way too spectacular. I had the short ribs with the white bean ragu. Everything meshed well together. It was flavorful. The truffle mac and cheese and the grits, you can really see the butter. The steak was cooked perfectly. However, you're really here for the view. You're on top of Mandalay Bay, and you can see the entire strip from the top."}
{"text":"Formerly an exclusive member-only venue, the Foundation Room is a beautifully decorated, unique, warm, fun, stylish place located at the top of Mandalay Bay. There is a special elevator close to the hotel entrance to access the place. We visited the Foundation Room as a group and invested in bottle service (4 bottles) which I had arranged the previous week. The executive VIP host who helped me set up our party was terrific. He was very friendly, accommodating and did a great job explaining all the details around ensuring our event was super high quality and fun for our group. I didn't feel like their only intention was to take as much cash from me as possible, they seemed legitimately interested in ensuring we had a great time at a reasonable cost. Cheers to social media...they all understand the power of the online review.  The Foundation Room offers a large outside terrace overlooking the strip from a distance, probably 1 of the top 3 views of Las Vegas. During our event, we were assigned our private server and bouncer. Our server was very precise, respectful and kept the drinks flowing, even during some of the group craziness. She wasn't over pouring and being reckless with our high-priced booze. Our bouncer at one point removed some guy from our area (who was trying to sneak drinks from our bottles). He was also available to escort girls in our party to restrooms and basically was available to take care of any unique needs beyond serving drinks. He also ensured one of the girls in our party was ok after she started getting a bit too wasted. He was respectful and handled the situation appropriately without dragging me or the group down.  I'm used to bottle service in Vegas being not as accommodating and certainly more expensive. I'd guess I paid about 30% less than I would have at one of the night clubs (which was not our preference anyway). Our group did want to dance, but we also wanted to relax, be able to speak to each other without yelling and be in an environment that we felt was exclusive and friendly. Our table area had a dance podium in front of it, so when the venue dancers used it, it was somewhat exclusive to us.  I've also been to the Foundation Room with my wife only, without the larger group. Still felt exclusive, exotic, warm and sexy (sounds more appropriate than \"romantic\") Highly recommend this place. If you're celebrating with a group and want to impress your friends with something different than the usual night club, this is a great choice."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Loved the view outside -- you get an awesome view of the strip!"}
{"text":"Got in with a member, found the crowd to be a little stuffy and on the older side.  Can't argue with the view of the strip from the top of Mandalay. Everyone has to experience this once."}
{"text":"I got the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good!They say that it is spicy, but I did not think it was very spicy. It had more of a smoky flavor, so if you're turned off from it because of the potential spice, don't be. Although it was good it was definitely over priced, but that is to be expected since you're paying for the view and experience."}
{"text":"Spending the weekend at the Four Seasons.  Came to the Foundation Room for dinner and drinks.  Beautiful restaurant and strip view.  Unfortunately, we sat 15 minutes waiting for someone to say hello and take our drink order.  Finally got up and left.  Very disappointing service."}
{"text":"Could be amazing. Came yesterday and they could not offer egg whites. Came at open - 7AM per sign. Some random dude informed us they do not open until 8AM. Shame for their advertising. I'm thoroughly disaponted"}
{"text":"Great view of the strip from the balcony drinking Cadillac margaritas..the food not as as good as expected but was okay."}
{"text":"I briefly came here with a friend who was visiting the DJ who was performing that night.  I love the interior design of the whole place. Super unique. Super classy.  I love their outdoor patio/balcony area, set up with VIP couches/tables, and outdoor DJ, and not to mention the gorgeous views of the strip.  Only complaint is that it's really small and cramped. Overall, pretty cool place to lounge or dance if you like small crowds."}
{"text":"We are lucky to have a relative that is a member of the HoB Foundation and we have come to the Las Vegas Foundation Room for dinner and a couple of special shows since 2006.   Like the Foundation Rooms in New Orleans and Las Angeles - the decor is lots of dark wood and comfy places to lounge.  What is different is the view.  They have a wonderful outdoor patio you can access off the lounge or the restaurant.  The restaurant is very subdued with dark wall panels, high ceilings and large windows.  It has a very elegant atmosphere.  The lounge has a dark wood bar with comfortable stools and you can look out to the patio and the great view.  There are several rooms you can relax in, have a private diner, or wander out on the patio to enjoy the view.  The patios are the one place you are allowed to smoke...which can dampen the enjoyment for non-smokers.  They have a good wine list but fairly limited to what they serve by the glass in the lounge.  The drinks are tasty and are the price of most upscale lounges in Vegas.    We have never gotten a bad meal in the restaurant.  You can linger over your meal, because they never seem to be trying to hurry you out and I don't remember the restaurant ever being crowded.  But bring your credit card or winnings from the tables because it is not a cheap meal.  We have also gotten appetizers at the bar.  Nice spot to start out your evening ...especially during the work week because it won't be packed.  And you can't beat the view.  If looking for an interesting spot to share drinks and conversation with friends, enjoy a million dollar view of Vegas and maybe catch a live music performance - this is it.  Looking for a \"pick up joint\" or a trendy hipster lounge....probably will be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Foundation Room is a great place to grab a drink and look out over the city.  It's dark and sexy, with a great outdoor balcony.  The view is awesome.  You can usually find a promoter handing out drink cards, so use them!  My drinks were strong and I had a good buzz on, just the way I like it.  Crowd seemed chill and the vibe hot.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I've been coming here to the Foundation Room since before I moved here 3 years ago. It has the most amazing view of the strip! It has great music for dancing and various special guests (tonight Dizzy Reed from GNR is DJing). Definitely the place to come when visiting Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"We headed here on a Friday night after being approached about being added to the guest list. As the guest list line was longer than the general admission line, we hopped into the general admission line instead. With less than a 5 minute wait, our names were checked off the list and we were on our way upstairs. Hint: Being on the guest list doesn't mean you won't wait in line - and possibly a longer than if you weren't on the list. Tip: If you are on the guest list and that line is crazy long, just get in the regular line.  Upon making our way upstairs, we wanted to see the view. The little outdoor area with the view is quite small and way crowded. Perhaps there are some other better areas to the Foundation Room, but we didn't see those. We just saw the little rectangle of a balcony. The music was thunderous, of course. There were reserved / VIP booths along the wall and the ledge. It was a complete wall of people standing between the wall and the ledge. You can't see, let alone appreciate, the view unless you have a VIP booth along the ledge. The standing crowd inhibits all sight of the view.  Needless to say, we found it to be a frustrating and not enjoyable experience. Again, perhaps there's entire areas of FR we missed that are nice and pleasant and have a great view. Perhaps dinner here is outstanding. I still want to come here for dinner. But I won't come here again to hang out on that balcony."}
{"text":"The view of the Strip is incredible, and the drinks were actually good (i.e., not watered down) but the service was slow. The music was good, but no one was dancing because there was a company event going on the night I went. I'd definitely go back to see what it's like when a bunch of business people aren't there acting like they have sticks up their behinds."}
{"text":"I'm a member here so I always take my out of town guests here. Of course everyone knows about the view. The food here could be better for the price, but I guess you don't really come here for the dining experience. If you get table service, you also get a personal attendant to make sure you're having a pleasant time."}
{"text":"The view alone makes this place worth it, it's gets a big packed so I recommend getting bottle service which can be a little pricey but that's Vegas for you, will definitely be returning soon"}
{"text":"Service and drinks were lacking. The view was pretty but you can only see it if you're outside, we went here instead of the stratosphere or sky fall lounge and it was okay. The decor is fun."}
{"text":"This place is LIT. Great views at night, good drinks and the bartender (Ryan I think) is a solid dude. They were all working hard and it was a chill environment for being Vegas and all. I'll be back."}
{"text":"unless you want to spend a thousand on a $20 bottle so your girl can sit down or have a place to put her purse,  dont come here.   The bouncer even denied her from taking her shoes off.  Plan on not having room to dance since they have added so many vip couches, everything is a walkway.  Best bet is the lift bar at aria which is chill, has live music and plenty of room."}
{"text":"This place was OFF THE HOOK!  I came here for my birthday one Saturday night after we saw how incredibly long and ridiculous the line for Light was.  I had to make a quick decision, and my cousin's girlfriend suggested Foundation Room.  cover is free for girls and $10 for guys.  It was dark here with candles and low lighting - what I would consider perfect ambiance.  It was similar to the ambiance of a speakeasy but bigger and with louder music and more people.  It was a very intimate setting for a bar and the music was at the perfect volume - loud enough to dance but soft enough to hear conversation and talk.  The outside provided a spectacular view of the Strip, where we ended up doing what seemed like a 1 hour photo shoot.    The night was quite a blur, but EVERYONE in my group of 21 people enjoyed themselves and couldn't stop talking about what a great venue and bar Foundation Room was.  They did kick my brother and cousin out around 1:30 AM, so behave yourselves here.  This was a really cool bar, and I would definitely come here again.  Hopefully I'll remember more next time!"}
{"text":"I always had a great time at the Foundation room. The drinks are always great, and the patio has a great view of the strip....check it out, you will like"}
{"text":"Food was so-so. Servers were somewhat inattentive. Climate control was a huge issue- fan blowing cool forceful air on diners could not be controlled by onsite staff. I would not go back."}
{"text":"We had supper and drinks at the Foundation Room before the Santana concert at the House of Blues.  The steaks and wine in the dining room were great.  After supper we went over to the lounge for drinks.  We loved the view of the city from the balcony. The atmosphere and décor creates a dark, fun, mysterious vibe. The service was great!"}
{"text":"Wife and I had an amazing experience Monday night when we had dinner and drinks. Tried to go back with clients  and nobody was allowed upstairs because a few gents had ecigs, you should make that notice to people before they drive across town for dinner... Massive door guy pretty much made our entire party feel like idiots because we had no clue? We were forced to abandon reservations and go elsewhere. Awful customer service at the door, fantastic  staff and food upstairs, if you can make it!"}
{"text":"NO cover, NO line, NO nasty people, and a cool view from the balcony!"}
{"text":"Worst club in Las Vegas! Trying to get into the club and bouncer named Roy harassed my group because he was ready for bed... ended up kicking us out because he didn't like being asked if he was ready to see id. Now communication and bad customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Carmen is the best. Such an amazing server. We had a great meal and will be back.  Food was great and the manager came by to check on us."}
{"text":"It was 60++ floors up with great views of the city.  DJ was a craftsman with his mixes.  If the was a down side it would be the prices but what club in Vegas worth going to isn't?"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the great experiences we've had here with our 35 and older crowd now 3 times! The view, the bumpin 90's to current hip hop music, the service, the gorgeous servers, dancers, just wow! We work with promotor extraordinaire James Lorenzo for VIP table service and have found the staff on the balcony to be the best in class! Nicole, Paul, Travis, you made our friend's 40th bday event so special with the attention and class only you can provide. Thank you Foundation Room! We'll be back for more fun I'm sure"}
{"text":"Foundation room is how you see Las Vegas at one glance !! It is mystic with touch of orient ! Food is amazing and staff are super friendly ! They can even teach you about Mountain's name surrounding the city ! One is called Sofia !! Great place to dine before or after a show at the house of Blues !! Bon Appétit"}
{"text":"Two words: douche central.   I had a bad feeling about this place when on the elevator ride up, some dbag was smoking a cigarette, spat on the floor, threw his cigarette down, stomped it out and left it. Note, the dude's girlfriend/date also rudely walked into me and didn't apologize. Classy.  Yes, they have a nice view from their balcony, but I was too suffocated by the hookah smoke (ha, didn't realize that people still DID that!) and blocked by the heads and bodies of the unattractive patrons to enjoy it. (My thinking is, if you're going to be an annoying douchebag, at least be attractive, right?!) Even though it was a $20 cover for my boyfriend to get in there (total rip off!), we left after one round of terribly overpriced drinks (I want to say it was like 45 bucks for a jack and coke and a grey goose/tonic). Just a gross place, avoid it."}
{"text":"Great place to get the BEST view of the Vegas Strip and offers great drinks to boot. The balcony views are great and add to romance of an evening with a date and friends. Food: have never had a bad meal. Service impeccable and again the views. Try the Steak and the Lobster Mac-N-Cheese  great wine selection and  great drinks. Enjoy! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My boy D and I hit up Foundation Room after a long day of work and sightseeing.  We were just looking for a relaxed vibe and a drink or two.    Luckily I had a connection to get us on the list, so can't really comment on cover costs.  The bouncer at the bottom of the elevators was cool to us and we got in pretty quickly.  FR was actually smaller than I thought it was going to be, but then again I think there may have been some other (private?) rooms that just weren't open the night we went.  The VIP couch areas take up a good amount of floor space in the main bar area (especially if people are dancing in the free space).  But the view is great from the balcony and the drinks aren't too expensive.  For the most part I enjoyed the crowd.  A couple of groups in the VIP couch areas who seemed to be having fun and were an attractive crowd.  A handful of cougars on the prowl, and your complement of single guys and gals with their eyes constantly scanning the crowd.  The decor is very Zen with a large Buddha guarding the entrance to the club once you step out of the elevators and some great wall decorations.  The combination of serene decorations and mellow music made for an enjoyable couple of hours.  I'd recommend people to check it out.  It's not wild and crazy like some other Vegas clubs, but that's part of the reason why I liked it.   More low key, mellow, loungey, than your typical over-the-top Vegas style club.  Most people probably wouldn't want to spend their entire night here, but it is definitely good for a couple of hours."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go. Great food at reasonable prices, as well as drinks that are very well made. friendly staff. Great atmosphere! My favorite dish I think would be shrimp and grits.  But its all good. Balcony view is AMAZING. It isn't so loud you can't here anyone. It does become more night clubish after 10."}
{"text":"If you likd the long lines, steep cover charges, over crowded dance floor, and over priced drinks....well this place isnt for you!  This is a more mellow atmosphere with little or no lines, cover was only $20 for guys on a Friday & Sat night I was their, and chill crowd.  Everyone talks about how amazing the view is at the top, and its just that!...AMAZING! The view alone is worth it."}
{"text":"You can't beat the view and the relaxed environment. Also, Probably the best Mac and cheese I've ever eaten in my life. Service is exactly what would be expected for a fine dining restaurant. I'm really glad they sat my boyfriend and I next to a window. The view was worth every dollar of the $215 tab for my boyfriend and I."}
{"text":"Didn't know this lounge existed until my wife and I happened by the entrance one evening. We had just returned from dinner at the Eiffel Tower and we're looking for a night cap. It was early (9pm) so they waived the cover and took us up the private elevator to the lounge on top of Mandalay Bay. Cocktails were around $12 but they offer bottle service with bottles north of $2000. Definitely one of the nicest places we visited this trip."}
{"text":"I spent this past Saturday night (my 30th birthday) at The Foundation Room at the top of The Mandalay Bay.    I couldn't have asked for a better way to spend my 30th.  It's a member's only place, but somehow my best friend made arrangements in advance for a group of 8 of us to go.  It was such a great time!  The interior decor is stunning, it's cozy yet not crowded, the crowd is just out to have a good time (not typical Vegas cheesy or pretentious), the view is unbelievable, and the dancing and music were just perfect.  I had such a wonderful time here.  Next time I go to Vegas, I definitely want to head back.  This was by far my favorite spot during the weekend."}
{"text":"I ate there recently and discovered they changed a few things on their menu. Didn't try everything new but did get the tuna bruschetta, very good. My steak was good too, but the highlight was their new flourless chocolate cake. Wow!  Can't wait to try that again."}
{"text":"Great place. Service was solid, atmosphere unique and the drinks great priced for the Strip and location at about $10 each. Have been to many 'ultra-lounges\" and this is perfect. Before 10pm, mellow, and relaxing, that after about 11pm kicks up. Security is great and issues never seem to happen. Dinner is great, excellent food, and best Strip views in Vegas. Way better than being trapped in a bubble looking at building sides as you go around in a circle."}
{"text":"The ambiance is really good and the bar food is amazing. The bar has an outside patio from where you can have a nice glimpse of the whole strip."}
{"text":"YES, YES, AND MORE YES for Foundation Room!!   This was our 3rd stop on our VIP UNLTD club crawl (see review) and boy, was I impressed. The venue itself is on the smaller side, with VIP seating in the middle that had a sort of \"living room\" feel. The music was excellent, playing a mix of hip-hop, pop, radio hits, and EDM. Drinks were definitely on the pricier side though, with a shot of simple Fireball whisky costing $10. I decided to go down to Evening Call for my discounted drinks that night, lol.   The view of the strip from the small outside balcony is BREATHTAKING. They say this is arguably the best and most complete view of the Strip in all of Vegas. You look to your left and you're literally right next to the shiny, golden lettering on the hotel that reads \"Mandalay Bay\". Pictures and descriptions don't do it justice.   I will definitely be back to the Foundation Room, especially if I want to hit up a smaller, slightly more chill spot after a long night of clubbing at places larger and more amped up. 5 stars, baby!"}
{"text":"Am I not remembering this place correctly? The view was spectacular from the outside patio, the drinks were delicious and moderately priced for Vegas, and the bartenders were cute.   But the music, oh the music. Nelly videos don't really seem \"high-end club\" appropriate. The decor is so beautiful and so zen, and the music is about Bentleys and hos. The juxtaposition is more jarring than welcomed.   The crowd was also very, very strange. There seemed to be a bar crawl of foreigners who's idea of hitting on a girl was to tell her that she's tall. Before that were a group of middle aged couples getting freaky to Missy Elliot on the dance floor. It's an interesting time and worth the visit if you don't have to pay a cover."}
{"text":"This place is very nice. It's not crazy crowded and the people who get up there are not ghetto at all. The riff raff seems to be weeded out. You can sit outside and enjoy this incredible view of the strip or hang out inside. Plenty of good drinks everywhere. I love making it a point to visit this room whenever I'm in Vegas.  If you have a Platinum MLife card, you automatically get to enter for free."}
{"text":"Hello Everybody, my husband and I had a great time again at the Foundation Room at Mandalay Bay again this year and was there last year too.  Foundation Room keeps getting better and always has great surprises and best costumes people with happy and smiling faces and great manners and very courteous staff.  We ate at the restaurant and never fails great front row views of Vegas.  So pleased and didn't get charged this year as I had our name on the Guest List.   Next year hope to be there again.  Maria C. Henderson,NV."}
{"text":"Very professional establishment. Had bottle service and the waitress always kept coming  around to make sure we were ok, security took care of us all night making sure no one was sitting in our booths that wasn't supposed to be. TIP your waitress and security generously!!! The DJ was killing it with old school 90's hip hop.. My group could not get off the dance floor!!! Awesome time!!!!"}
{"text":"This Review is just for the bar/lounge. Normally it is $30 a person to go up to the foundation room but we got free passes through my vegas. You have to go to the house of blues gift shop first to get the actual vouchers. Then you go to the four seasons elevator area to he admitted. Once you get to the top & into the lounge it has interesting decor & low key vibe. There are couches & a bar area inside but most people are out on the balcony to see the best view on the strip.   Since mandalay bay is at the south end of the strip, you get a full northbound view of the strip from high up. It's fantastic.  The drinks are pricey , but in the vegas norm."}
{"text":"Top of the hotel? Exclusive? Great view? Let me in, already!  The elevator to the Foundation Room is closed off and you need a reservation or else they won't let you in. Rode up to the top uninterrupted and was ready to chow down right away.  After getting out of the elevator, I couldn't help but gag at the decor in this place. It screams old boys club (which is what it was originally). However, for the amount of hype this place builds, I was hoping for such much more! Not some tacky, gaudy restaurant.   And I have a pretty sensitive nose, so maybe it's just me but the place has a very distinct scent to it... which I'm not sure I was loving.  We're seated right away -- mostly because the entire place was dead with the exception of one other party. Servers were prompt and helpful with our every need. Then again, for the price I was about to pay for dinner... I expected no less.  I ordered the baked scallops while my boyfriend ordered a new york strip steak. We both decided to share the yukon mashed potatoes.   I'm salivating at the thought of the juicy baked scallops and can't wait for them to come. I'm expecting something savory and delicious. I wanted something that would stamp out my hunger and leave me satisfied.  When they came, I was obviously excited.  HOLY SALT! I nearly spit my first bite of the scallop out of my mouth. I couldn't believe how salty it was. YUCK.  Boyfriend's steak looks delicious. I wish I had ordered it. He obviously chows down with no issues.  Our yukon mashed turned into another salty side platter of herb baked potatoes. Not sure how yukon mash turns into baked potatos, but okay. They were salty as hell.  All in all, food was NOT worth it.   The view? FABULOUS.   Overall, never going again. You can get much better meals and experiences at other Vegas restaurants."}
{"text":"Best place to come check out the view of the strip. Great music, zen-like ambiance, and friendly staff. Per the usual in Vegas, if you're a girl, entrance is most likely free. Prepare to pay $10-$20 if you're coming with your guys.   I went with 2 customers, so we went outside a couple of times to chat without trying to yell over the loud music inside. Highly recommended...this place never disappoints."}
{"text":"The last thing I ever expected from the House of Blues was to be surprised.  I consider HOB to be pretty predictable and it definitely isn't a place that I'd consider for any type of nightlife outside of a concert.    Enter:  The Foundation Room.    This place is pretty cool.  It has a hookah lounge meets Morocco meets Bourbon Street vibe (w/ the outdoor patio).  It's eclectic and intimate and I'd love to go back again, order a bottle of Pinot and a cheese plate and just pretend like I'm hanging out somewhere 3000 miles away."}
{"text":"The view was absolutely stunning. But that was the highlight. The night I decided to go here it was extremely packed! Could barely get a very expensive drink and only to find out it was not what I ordered. The music was pretty good but it was so packed you couldn't really dance. It was an experience but I don't think I would return."}
{"text":"The balcony is EVERYTHING! The DJ was pretty good, they played a great variety of music. Hard to get the bartenders attention unless you're waving money. Was able to get on the guest list and had free champagne and well drinks til 12am! The club is a little on the smaller side."}
{"text":"The view is breathtaking. Was a bit small, but could have been because it was a Sunday. Perhaps, they close off a few area.   The elevator ride was short, so it was perfect for those who are claustrophobic."}
{"text":"Foundation Room, located at the top of the Mandalay Hotel this place gets an extra star for the views. You can honestly see the entire strip from up here. There is an exclusive elevator strictly for the restaurant and you will not be allowed up unless you have a reservation.  I booked a table for a couple of my friends birthdays. The decor is what you would expect from an exclusive gentleman's club...think old money. Once seated, the servers are attentive to you. This is what you would expect at these prices. Think of the Foundation Room as a place you would take your best friends, clients or significant other. You should dress up as its a club that requires jackets.  The food is a higher quality and the taste was great. To compliment the food we had bottles of wine. Yes, the pairing was great and lets just say that it was the start of a fun night out.  Ive heard that some nights this restaurant turns into a club. I havent been here when it has  but Im assuming its a lounge style to enjoy the great views."}
{"text":"Now this review may be slightly skewed and I'll explain why.  You see I've been a Member of the Foundation Room for a number of years.  I frequent my local one in Texas regularly.  With that in mind the Foundation Room here in Vegas didn't disappoint!!!  The concierge, host desk, bartenders and wait staff were all excellent!  My party and i were well taken care of and we were quite happy with everything overall."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place in Las Vegas to soak in all the decadence of the city! The best nights to go are Thurs-Saturday and I believe that it's always free for ladies, perhaps before a certain time? I'd call before just to double check that they are open since I'm pretty sure they're closed some week nights. This club/lounge feels super special as you must get in the elevator and press the special 'foundation room' button to get there. The doors open and you enter a heaven 64 floors open above the city. It is soaked in deep, dark colors with lots of buddhas and Asian feeling statues and decorations everywhere. It feels very worldly and exotic.  The ambience is a perfect blend of lounge and club with a dj playing dance music but it's not so big that you lose your friends or get a headache from the decibel levels. The main room has a large bar and leads you to the big outside patio. The view is unbelievably beautiful and so intoxicating. It's a great blend of all types of people and not just overrun with 20 somethings like sole of the mega clubs are. After going there a half dozen times I actually stumbled upon a small room in the back playing EDM.  It felt like a secret party and was so much fun! This place is the absolute best!"}
{"text":"So, my boyfriend and I came here the week of Christmas...we were pretty disappointed.    Maybe it was that it was dead because of said holiday.   Maybe it seemed lame and sad because there were only 2 families out on the balcony and 2 couples there to take pictures against the impressive backdrop.    Maybe it was the sad go-go dancer, dancing up a storm while nobody paid attention, or maybe it was that there was nobody really around to pay attention.   I dunno.  I just know that it seemed really desperate and really boring while we were there.  I'm sure that on nights where it's packed, it's a much better atmosphere, but, damn.  It wasn't on that night.   Having just spit out all that negativity, I will say that they gave very generous pours, especially for Vegas standards, and that the view from the balcony is worth your time.   Maybe I'm just getting old and don't appreciate these places anymore, but I highly doubt it."}
{"text":"This is a must visit for the view. The club itself was pretty fun and prices were reasonable for the location. The reason for not having 5 stars was that security kept blaming for everything that wasn't happening. I heard several people blamed for throwing stuff off the balcony and nothing like that was happening at all. Invest in some better cameras if you're going to blame people for things."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this restaurant.  It is located on the 67th floor of Mandalay Bay.  Our waiter was really attentive and checked on us frequently.  I ordered the filet mignon with chimichurri sauce, and it was REALLY good.  If you are a fan of mac n cheese, then I highly recommend getting the truffle mac n cheese.  I probably could have eaten a big bowl of that.  There is a patio that overlooks the strip,  go take pics on the patio."}
{"text":"4 stars for a good view of the strip and 3.5 stars for food. Some dishes were great and others were a miss. One guy in our group did not receive his entree for a very long time which they did remove from the bill. For the prices here, such a long delay is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Great view. Disappointing food. Service was not up to par as expected for the price point. Minor details makes a big difference.   My drink was knocked over and glass was broken, took a long time to replace. Had to waited to steak knife only to find out steak was over cooked. Sent back and waited another long time while others are done with their food.   Steamed clams was overly salty. Crab cakes were dried. Overall, it was not worth the money in a competitive dinning environment like Vegas. Probably great for drinks but won't be back for dinner."}
{"text":"3 rooms, great views,  outdoor lounge from the top of Mandalay bay. Fun. A slightly older crowd (eg 30/40ish), but perfect for me."}
{"text":"It was an interesting experience but as a locsl there was a lot to be desired. Happy hour was a bait and switch and service was awful"}
{"text":"We went for dinner before MJ's One. We were on a time crunch and the staff accommodated us wonderfully. The view of the strip was great and so was the food. A member in my party had the lamb, she needed to get the bad lamb taste from another Vegas restaurant off her palate, she said the lamb was excellent. I had the scallops and it was one of the best I've had.  I'm coming back next time I'm in town and would recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"Food is great, drinks are great, staff was great, and Sirius Chill sets the mood.  Dark and romantic.  The view is spectacular. We went early, nice crowd, but not too crowded.  No cover before 10pm. Best lounge we've been to in 14 years of visiting Vegas.  Truffle Mac & Cheese is crazy!!! Just go already:)"}
{"text":"Very laid back lounge with a diverse crowd. I would say the crowd is a little on the older side unlike the typical younger crowd you see at the hottest nightclubs on the strip. The dancers here are less skanky and more elegant. They range from belly dancers to seductive dancers with peacock costumes and led lights. Some of the dancers are often on the dance floor dancing alongside with you! You will also get a very nice view of the strip and Mandalay bay from the patio."}
{"text":"We went to the Foundation Room for a friends 50th birthday.  It was scheduled through a promoter who greeted us at the elevator.  We had a group of 10 people. The promoter escorted us up to the lounge. Our table wasn't ready and we had about a 15 minute wait. We headed to the balcony which really was the only reason that this review received any stars.  It was dark and the decor was a little trashy.  Wires hanging from exposed outlets etc.  we were finally seated and had to wait for quite som time for menus and service.  Our friend, the guest of honor, asked if he could order a drink, the server said yes and walked away.  The food was ok but for the price should have been better.  The servers were rude and not very attentive.  The bus boy was probably the only one that was doing his job.  They brought out the wrong meals and then got upset when we told them it wasn't what we ordered.  I'm sure if you are only going for cocktails it's fine but the rest was not worth it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great music!  It's a lounge/club for adults...   it's like a club but it's not...  seemed like a little older crowd... (we were celebrating our friends 40th birthday) and we fit in, definitely a range of age but not the bodycon 21 year olds.... we had table service inside, I thought was perfect and the service was great.  It was fun to dress up, dance,  and hang with your friends!  Inside was great because they had dancers/belly dancers and room to dance.  Outside was a spectacular view, but as you would imagine crowded, but easily accessible and could move up and down fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Nina Quincy is THE most amazing person!! She met us and took us in and showed us an.amazing time!! She shared with us some of the history of the foundation room, had our table ready and waiting on us, she kept in contact with us the entire night to make sure we were comfortable and we were taken care of. We couldn't have asked for a more wonderful time. Fantastic views of the strip!"}
{"text":"Went with a member this last time on a Saturday night. It was not very crowded, but most or probably all of the tables were not bussed and overflowing with dirty dishes...  Once made aware, they did come out and partially clean one small table.  The bar was not very busy, but the bartenders did a good job making themselves look busy and not being very helpful. After being ignored by the bartenders for about 10 min we left. The member we were with did register a valid complaint. This is the third time having not so great service in this place. It is kind of a running joke for us now!  Kind of a cool atmosphere though."}
{"text":"We just went to this place for the first time tonight. I will recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"After the Michael Jackson show on a Monday we went up to the foundation room for some drinks... I got one free drink ticket but when I got to the bar they were out of champagne so I settled with vodka cranberry which by the way had more cranberry than vodka... I ordered a second drink with cash and it had a bit more vodka... The lighting is very dim the DJ was playing songs from back in the 2000s it was not very packed the Decor was antique rugs on the floor a fireplace ...the crowd was also older about 40's and up . They also have a good outside view but there's not a lot of seating ."}
{"text":"I mean you're coming here for the view right?  I mean that part is worth it."}
{"text":"Some dude handed us a voucher for free entry into the Foundation Room and two complimentary drinks. The view is amazing. Somehow our two complimentary drinks turned out to be $22 for a glass of wine and $6 for a well drink. I guess they do math differently here in Vegas."}
{"text":"We were in awe of the venue and the gorgeous view overlooking the city at night!  However, I must say, the foods were over-rated and a bit salty.    We ate our foods and enjoy each other's company nevertheless.  But what happened at the end was the last straw for me!!  WORSE customer service ever!!  Anthony, our server, took forever to fill our orders and kept forgetting to bring us what we requested.  Didn't bother to check up on us to see if we need anything or how the foods were to our tasting!!  For a party of 9 we altogether sampling roughly 15 items on the menus... Let's just say that we were left VERY disappointed!  When the bill came, we saw a few extra items and inquire on these extras. The items in questions were not ordered or served to us.  He then said there was a drink that came out but he forgot to add it to the bill and took the bill saying he needed to add the 'drink' to the bill but will comp it on the house.  We got a revised bill for more than our meals plus the 18% gratuity because he unilaterally chooses the amount of gratuity for himself on top our bill!!  Seriously??  I never expected such type of 'bait and switch' tactic from this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Honestly the food was 4.5 stars. The atmosphere is horrible. They had us wait on the outdoor patio until our table was ready. It was DISGUSTING. Filthy dirty chairs, stained, and food mashed in. The menus were sticky and dirty. I wouldn't even sit on the chairs with my dress clothes. The actual restaurant was creepy. Buddha decor, very dated carpet and chairs from the 60s.  The food and service was good except for the aloof hostess. Not friendly at all. And the whole ritual to get in to the place looks like something out of a gangster movie."}
{"text":"Love the professional girls dancing on the tables. Great view of the strip, all lit up at night.   Neat rooms.  Cramped space though. And it depends on what night you go. Music can be hit or miss. As can the crowd."}
{"text":"Maybe I went at a bad time or on a bad night, but I couldn't wait to ditch the place for something more enticing. The crowd was too old, the music wasn't getting any reaction (meaning no dancing), and I can't believe this place is members only... I would never pay. If you like a stiff, older crowd then check it out :)"}
{"text":"Very nice place to have a private party! The club itself is very nice for people of all ages. I think they could do better with DJ's. I was there the Saturday before Memorial Day."}
{"text":"What a great time we had! The entire staff from the greeter down stairs to the hostesses and wait staff were top notch. The food was out of this world good!! My wife got the NY strip and I got the long bone short rib that was so tender didn't need a knife.   Afterwards we went to the patio where we had a great view of Vegas."}
{"text":"I used to be a member, and I think it's seen it's better days. It's not very exclusive when they hand out passes to everyone who walks into the casino. Now, it just seems old and a bit beat up. It used to be the place I wanted to go. Now, it's just the place I go if (insert club here) is too crowded. As for the food, it's Vegas. You can do better (and pay less). It still is probably the best view in Vegas, and if you can afford the New Years Eve party, it's unforgettable. It was great when you could watch the HOB shows live in the media room.  Go for drinks on the patio, but not for any other reason."}
{"text":"Through some good fortune I am a Foundation Gold member this year which has allowed me the opportunity to eat at the restaurant and hang out at the club more often.  Restaurant: They changed their menu from the last time I dined here. It is now based around small plates and appetizer size foods. A la carte meats and cheeses, oysters, and other treats. They have a few large items that I have not tried yet. My wife and my dining plan is usually to try a bunch of small stuff and share.  In an age where restaurants seem to be cutting back on the size and diversity of bread baskets, this one is wonderful. Four types of bread and a trio of butter. The short rib with spicy kimchi is unique and tasty, and spicy. The chicken lollypops are chicken wings elevated with two delicious sauces. The pork and prawns which lacks any discription on the menu is two large bacon wrapped shrimp and a slaw. Can't really go wrong with something wrapped in bacon.  My only real problem is that my oysters seemed to be shucked with a hammer. They were very fresh and tasty, but there were substantial shell bits in most of them. On a related note, I was at a party in the lounge that was serving food and the shrimp pot pie I had (although very good, and in the cutest little cast iron skillet you've ever seen) was also full of shell. Keep an eye on the prep work guys and I'll be happy.  The Club: I'm kind of like an old person here. I don't go here late very often when the DJ is going and it has more of a club feel. It is a great place for the view and it's nice to bring people from out of town up here for a little bit different experience. Most of the time the bartenders are very cold and not too worried about you. The drinks are a couple dollars more than downstairs at Mandalay Bay, but the 20% off member discount helps. They also hand out 2-for-1 coupons in the casino that are good for well drinks and domestic beers that help out with the cost as well."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing..food was the best I had the whole trip  and you  can't beat the view. At night it turns into a night  club and they had an open champagne bar for  the ladies. Which we took advantage of and loved. This place was so much fun but the  only downside  is its a little small."}
{"text":"I LOVE the bar!!!  The decorations are amazing!  The view is incredible!  I try to go here whenever I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"What a great view of the strip!  Our cocktails were very tasty, but we did not stay too long.....We were the only people there at opening, so it was not too exciting due to that.  However, I will go back again to enjoy the amazing view."}
{"text":"The view the view the view. That's what everyone says about this place. It was really easy to get into - i.e. no line. A lot of the people there on the inside dancing seemed older the night that we went. I kind of got this dirty old man vibe from the sausage party lining the corners of the dark inside area.  We made our way out to the legendary viewing deck. And it was smaller like a tiny apartment balcony. So tiny. Part of it was roped off to some VIP tables which made it seem probably smaller than it was.   The view is nice up there - if you are tall enough to see it over everyone's heads. People were clustered like beans in a can so tightly, trying to take so many pictures. There was barely any room. I'm just glad I was wearing 5 inch heels so I could actually see a bit. If you are a shorty, FORGET IT. You will see nothing unless you ride on someone's shoulders. Then you'd probably fall off the edge because there isn't much of anything besides a ledge up there. Don't do it. If you're drunk, you'll fall and it's high up.   We took a picture and left."}
{"text":"Best meal of my life!  Some friends of ours are members and made reservations for the four of us for dinner last month.  Upon taking the elevator ride, we were escorted to a private room that was dimly lit and well-decorated with an Indian flair and a fantasic view of the back of the strip.  Soft music played in the background as we sat down on cushy-comfy couches.  Our friend had formed a friendship with the mater'd and we were treated like royalty.  We enjoyed two bottles of their newest champagne (served in wine glasses with ice and mint leaves), enjoyed the tiger shrimp wrapped with bacon as a appetizer, and took photos.  For dinner I had the roasted chicken while hubby enjoyed rack of lamb.  It was his first time eating it and said it was amazing.  I tried a bite and it was!  Our friends ordered several sides including truffled mac n cheese, which I tried and enjoyed.  I was very satisfied with the meal.  After dinner we went out to the bar and ordered drinks.  While the men drank whisky, us ladies enjoyed a drink new to me: pineapple upside down cake (in a double).  So good!   We went out to the balcony which offered a gorgeous view of the strip and \"front row\" seats to the Avenged Sevenfold concert playing across the street.  By far, my night at Foundation Room was the best night in a long time :)  PS.  It was really cool to see the private lockers of some of my favorite celebs!  Too bad the night didn't grant me a sight of the actual person."}
{"text":"My friends and I purchased one of the VIP Bar tours.  This bar was on the list of clubs.  It was the first stop on the list, and the best part about it is the view.  Amazing balcony view from the top of Mandalay Bay.  That definitely makes it worth the trip.  However, do NOT think you will be dancing here.  They do not allow cameras in the club itself.  It is very dark, with dark wood panelling and dark wood bar.  Dimly lit.  There are lounging chairs and couches, and two go-go dancers that dance on small platforms.  Although we enjoyed a good drink, we witnessed that security would approach any customers that were dancing and ask them to stop.  Only the go-go dancers can dance.  The customers just stand around, or lounge on couches.  So, go, take some great pictures outside on the balcony, and then leave.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Wanted to check this place out for the raving comments about the view, so my boyfriend and I ventured to this place to take a peek after dinner.  LOCATION: There are no signs directing you to the Foundation Room as you're walking around in Mandalay Bay. Elevators are located on the backside of the guest elevators and right in front of the escalators that lead you to the pool/beach.  INSIDE: You take an elevator to go to the top and once you get there, the place is pretty dark. The restrooms are right next to the elevator. There's a section for dining in, but we just walked over to where the bar and balcony was. There was plenty of seating (I think) but the place was so packed, we didn't want to stay. Can get a little claustrophobic if there's a crowd.  BALCONY: View is pretty nice! Smoking is allowed outside on the balcony, so if you're not comfortable with that - don't stay out there so long.  We took in the views, took some pics and headed back down. Maybe we'll come back and check this place out again another time?"}
{"text":"Well, I can't comment on the food, as I only went for a late-evening round of drinks (which I think turned into 5 or 6 rounds...).    The place is definitely cozy and welcoming, and while I'm not sure of the guestlist situation, the fellow at the elevator just nodded at us as our group announced itself and ushered us right in.    As it was the middle of the week, the place was pretty calm and not overrun by pretentious twits, which was just perfect by us.  Good drinks with an excellent selection, and a bartender that also sold us cigarettes and cigars made it very difficult to want to leave.  From the Buddha at the top of the elevator to the Strip in all of its (lurid?) glory, the views here are worth the trip."}
{"text":"Go for the view. That's about it. I'm not into clubs but I can deal with lounges (I'm too old for either of those scenes, really). But, I could see this being a decent place to hang if you're with a good group. The balcony area is decent but can get crowded quickly and there are only a few places to sit. Inside you can sit if you want bottle service. They've also got a few rooms that were roped off... I guess for bottle service also. The bartenders were quick and friendly and there were some decent go-go dancers. The crowd was a bit older -- upper 30's and up. If you really want to head up to the 60-whatever floor to see the view, go ahead. Take a pic, admire the strip, get a few drinks, hang for a bit, and head somewhere else."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a couple drinks and a cigar to check out the views.They are some of the best in town.We had to go inside to ask for someone to come out to take our drink order.They sent out a gal named Sasha who acted like she was doing us a favor.When we asked to bring our tab to cash out we noticed she had added someone's shooters to our bill which we pointed out and she quickly admitted to the mistake.Drinks are already high to begin with,so make sure to check your bill thoroughly when going up there."}
{"text":"Ehh, tries to pass off as a high end spot but the atmosphere wasn't right and the music had everyone kinda standing around hoping the next song would be better. Plus the bouncers were whack, they'd harass anyone tryna check out the club from the outside. Dope view for pictures once you get to the top tho."}
{"text":"Very pleasant place for a date night! Excellent food in the restaurant or appetizers in the patio and bar area.. Nice relaxing decor and live DJ .. The view from the balcony is unparalleled in Vegas..  We like to go on week nights to avoid complete craziness and we go early.."}
{"text":"My company funded a cocktail hour here recently, which I got to attend. The view is SPECTACULAR. The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable. The little beef wellington hors d'uvre were delightful. The bartender made this drink... he didn't give it a name... that was like a glass of happiness.   Yeah. Go there."}
{"text":"I had my doubts even though there are so many reviews and a high rating I really was expecting the worst, I was wrong.    We had dinner with a business associate and his wife and she really wanted to try it so of course we will say yes even though we had low expectations.  It was last minute and the night of Santana opening up his show but they fit us in in the time frame we wanted without a problem.  Because it was Santanas opening they had to make accommodations for more seating.  We lucked out and were seated in one of the nightclubs VIP rooms.  So we had our own private room with amazing decor and large extremely comfy couches!    We ordered our drinks and began looking over the menu which is large and has a lot of options to try depending on your tastes.  Our friends had Shrimp and Grits and 8oz Center Cut Filet.  The shrimp and grits were good he enjoyed them but wished for more flavor in it, the steak was done to perfection she enjoyed her meal as well.  My Boyfriend had the Seared Diver Scallops that he said were done perfectly not a bit of rubbery feel to any of them.  I had the Mediterranean Sea Bass, with yukon potatoes, fennel slices assorted olives and a lemon vinaigrette.  My fish was left moist but firm the mixture of the olives and lemon vinaigrette made the mixture of the flavors stand out in my mind.    I definitely recommend a dinner here if you are looking for a great view great ambiance and great food and service.  I will be back..."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with dinner. My wife and I went on a Monday evening, very slow night. We started with the crab cakes....they tasted store bought. I would not recommend them. The short ribs lacked flavor."}
{"text":"I have been to the Foundation Room numerous times over the years while visiting Vegas and Mandalay Bay. It is quite a large area as there are many rooms you can sneak off too, provided you are on the VIP list or possibly know the right people. The view of the strip is awesome and that is what most people come up here for. The cost of drinks are quite steep, but it is Vegas and it is the Foundation Room, but just be prepared. It would be a great date night for you and the special someone, especially on the slower nights which are usually Tuesday/Wednesday."}
{"text":"At times it's great, and other times it just felt odd. Some of the workers (especially in the restaurant) are just socially awkward. They said there is a dress code, but it didn't seem to be enforced. They let up guys in jeans, hoodies, and baseball hats, which really killed the vibe (since we were dressed pretty nicely). The opening DJ on Tuesday, December 29 was TERRIBLE. I asked a few of the servers when Kay the Riot was going to start and they had no idea.  All that aside, the food is great, the drinks are great, and the workers in the lounge are friendly. If they would've enforced the dress code I would've given it a higher rating."}
{"text":"The Foundation Room is located at the very top of the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino. I loved the place, very classy and upscale. The lounge itself is very good with great atmosphere and music. Balcony area is probably the best place to view the lights of the Vegas Strip. Beautiful views and the perfect place to take a picture.   We have visited The Foundation Room several times in the past and it never gets old. This time around we were out there for a conference and had an invite for the private party. I'd not recommend paying for a cover charge to get in though. Best to go to Mandalay late afternoon and get onto the guest list - which also includes free entry and 2 free drinks for the ladies. We also noticed that there were people inside the casino handing out free passes for promotion during the day."}
{"text":"I love the decor here the private rooms and the view out the balcony thats all I remember it was worth the decor alone."}
{"text":"This place is hands down, the BEST lounge I've ever been to. I'm not saying that just in the Vegas vicinity alone....I'm comparing this place to all the other lounges I've been to anywhere else in the world.   Okay..that's subjective, I've only covered three continents out of six. The seventh doesn't count for obvious reasons unless I'm trying to break some sort of record. Top Gear South Pole, anyone?  This lounge knows classy. The management and the founders behind this place know what's tasteful in terms of decor, and they know what kind of crowd they're catering to.   When you walk in right after exiting the elevator to get up here (rooftop of Mandalay Bay. If you watch a lot of music vids, you've seen this place) you'll notice a very impressive looking Buddha statue. Ask any of the hostesses about the story behind it!  The cocktails here are made VERY well. There are go-go dancers in the center room, and you can land a table or a private room with advanced reservations. They also have an awesome cigar menu at lounge prices (a little more expensive than a typical cigar lounge).  Probably the most breathtaking part of this lounge aside the decor and the vibe of the place is the view you get here that you just can't get anywhere else on the strip. Walk outside to the patio where you can see the entire strip and its lights at night from the south end all the way up to the north.  I've made this lounge my go-to spot for all my friends and our Saturday nights.   If you and your friends are tired of the archaic waiting, prices, and crowd of night clubs, and would like to try something new, swing by FR. You can find the entrance next to the elevators at Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"A lounge where we couldn't lounge because all the chairs were roped off....  Came here with a group of friends on a Friday night. The promoter told us that all girls would get in for free and will receive drink tickets. He also mentioned that the boys will have to pay $20 but not to worry as it comes with free drinks - lies!!! Our boys paid their fee but never got free drinks.   Ambiance: lively and poppin but crowded. It was set up like a lounge but since there was no way you could sit unless you paid at least $800 you have no other option than to stand on the walk path. People were dancing on the pathways so it was like a club with not dance floor. The outside area is the same. There's a nice view but good luck squeezing in there to take a picture of the view.   Drinks: the drink tickets were for a bubbly champagne or a vodka drink. They serve it in a small cup with lots of ice. I was surprised as to how much vodka flavor was in my cranberry vodka. Others would probably feel like, \" yes they hooked it up with the alcohol\" but It didn't taste right. Drinks were ridiculously priced.  No video recording... No video... No recording... No 15-second Instagram footage. FYI. I kept getting caught trying to film my friends and I having fun. That rule was a bit odd.  Can someone explain to me why the security/bouncer guys have to get my attention by lightly pinching the inner part of my arm?! Gross! Please don't touch me. Tap my shoulders. That would have been more respectful.  Overall, not my scene. If I wanted to go to a club I would go to a club... Not a lounge such as this... But I wanted to go to a lounge... and this lounge did not meet my expectations. I usually have problems with other costumers and their etiquette. Unfortunately this time, its the service and staff that disappointed me.  I suggest going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Is it worth the hassle.. Once there your trapped.. So a view,, once is enough.."}
{"text":"Came here for a party.   The lounge had a lot of comfortable seating.   The balcony had a great view of the strip.   The bartenders are heavy handed with their drinks."}
{"text":"Walked into the elevator and go straight to the top, you will step out and instantly feel wicked sexy ;-) This isn't a club, it's an ultra lounge but it makes me feel like it's my rich uncles den and I was invited over for stiff drinks with dinner. Strolling through the dark, intimate Buddhist themed lounge in heels and a little black dress I felt like a predator making my way out to the belvedere. The view is stunning, it adds even more sex appeal to this beautiful lounge. During the winter heat lamps are provided but who needs those when this environment is perfect for getting warmth through drinks and body heat ;-)    I've been coming to Foundation Room for many moons now since I'm anti club kid but I need to occasionally entertain out of town guests. Foundation Room is owned by House of Blues and use to be available to members only. I felt privileged when I was invited to join the events in the past but now this gorgeous lounge is available to all to enjoy. I almost dare to say it's a unintentional best kept secret in Las Vegas. The crowd isn't young 20 something's, it's more 30-40's so you won't see little ladies having their hair held back in the bathrooms because drinking is a new thing to them. The dark romantic ambiance plays well with my soul, way more than the uber mega clubs on the strip.   It's not just a lounge mind you there is a fine restaurant here also. I really won't touch much onto that because it was years ago when I ate there and my memory is fairly faded about that night. I do remember drinks were abundant, stiff and I was all smiles and sunshine that night. I will just assume my food pleased me other wise the libations made the food extremely palatable.   Ladies and Gents, if you are like me and enjoy feeding your dark sultry side and  would rather be around class than frat boys and woo girls I suggest you make your way to the 63rd floor of Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"Make no mistake, this is no nightclub. What you see here is what you get! There is an amazing view out on the balcony of the 63rd floor. The lounge area is elegant and I love the interior decoration present with the dark red decor and the Buddha statues everywhere!  Because it wasn't very busy here, we were offered access into the VIP room. We got a discounted bottle service and they also brought out a hookah set with many flavors! They had a professional photographer (pictures are hefty priced) as well. The whole three hours we were there, our group felt very taken care of.   If you are looking for a low-key place to dance and drink with your friends with a beautiful view, I present to you the Foundation Room."}
{"text":"This place is such a treasure here in Las Vegas! There's oh so many clubs, but after a while, the typical ones just become mundane. Foundation Room has the exclusive feel that most people are looking for.   We've been here on many occasions, with each time getting better! So, this review is LONG overdue. The nightclub is so fun! They have amazing GoGo dancers, guest DJs, celebrity appearances and a whole array of signature drinks,  along with VIP bottle service. The bar staff and servers are TOP NOTCH! .. And their executive hosts are very accommodating! They'll make your visit to Foundation Room unforgettable!   I had my birthday party there last year. The view of the strip is breathtaking! It's definitely the place you want to be to celebrate any special occasion. It's also without a doubt THEEE BEST venue to celebrate NYE! We took so many memorable pictures and video.   Last night was the first time we dined in the lounge. Highly recommended. We decided to eat in their comfortable lounge and tried a bunch of noms :-)  My favorite was the Saturn's Crust Grilled cheese! I'm still thinking about it as I type. We also tried the steak skewers, Korean fried chicken bao buns, and the Korean BBQ riblets. Everything was delicious! I can't wait to go back.. enjoy!"}
{"text":"Get $100 certificate for $50 on restaurant.com. Bread dipping spreads so good. The food was good not great but we Loved the ambiance."}
{"text":"The views from the rooftop say it all. We came here after dinner for a nightcap and the atmosphere was relaxing with great music playing in the background.  *No fee for women after 10pm"}
{"text":"The Foundation Room is a \"VIP\" Club at the top of Mandalay Bay. As you might imagine, it is pricy, but the food is not up to par with the cost.   Our party shared two appetizers - a flatbread pizza w/ shrimp and Kobe Beef Carpaccio. The pizza was decent, but tasted strangely of peanuts, and the Carpaccio was good, but I expect a bit more flavor from this type of ingredient.   My entree was the Horseradish-Encrusted Beef Tenderloin. I was not impressed, especially considering the steakhouse prices. The steak was cooked past medium and it was not juicy. The taste was good, but the horseradish crust was a little hard to eat, as it flaked off instead of being truly a part of the steak.   The Parsnip Purée was good, tasting mild like mashed potatoes, but it did have a baby food texture to it. There was only a small amount in the container. Three asparagus was an oddly small side dish as well.   As for the venue, the service was very good and the entire place smelled of Heavy incense.   I just want more flavor and satisfaction from a meal at that price."}
{"text":"Small area but very fun to go have a good time. The view from the balcony is amazing. One of the bar tenders was amazing and nice. The other one that was outside on the bar balcony was snobby. So we would walk all the way inside to get our drinks. The dancers are beautiful and nice. Drinks at spendy but that is how it is everywhere on the strip. Overall we would go again."}
{"text":"When you've had enough of the hoi polloi open your wallet and head over to the Foundation Room in the Mandalay Bay.  Take the private elevator that shoots you to the top of the hotel.  First have a cocktail in the bar which has a large patio overlooking the Strip.  Then sit down in the dining room where the food and the service are as good as you'll find in any first class restaurant.  The menu is American, with a variety of steak, lamb, seafood and so on.  Main courses run about $35-$45.  We had a very enjoyable evening and will be back."}
{"text":"It was something different instead of fancy decor they show off ancient artifacts with every room there is a theme, they host to mostly VIP celebs with a wide variety of choices to pick from. The photos tell a little about what kind of experience you will venture very unique"}
{"text":"It's the Vegas strip.  It's not cheap, so don't expect it to be.  The Foundation Room has become my new favorite weekend dance club.  Despite $5 waters and $9 \"cheap\" beers, the music makes it worth it.  Admission is expensive, and unless you're either a) female - and can get $10 passes wandering through Mandalay Bay, or b) willing to grease the hand of the doorman (then he may give you his card and you can get this $10 priority admission for your local crew), you'll likely be asked for $30 at the door.  As a \"local lady\" in this town I can generally get into most clubs for free, but it's worth it to me to pay the $10 and go to the Foundation Room for our girls nights out.   The most compelling reason is THE MUSIC.  The DJ generally plays a great mix of hip hop, dance, and rock music from the 80's through today.  The variation is welcome compared to most clubs only playing the most contemporary music (regardless of the quality).  Second, the volume of the music keeps bringing us back!  You can actually hear each other talk in this club!  There's no doubt the volume is loud enough to get lost in if you wish, but even inside you can still understand what people are saying to you and ask your friends what they'd like to drink and hear the responses.  Plus, if you want a break from the boom-boom, just step outside on the balcony.  That brings us to the third plus, the balcony!  A smashing view of the Las Vegas Strip from the southern tip looking north.  If you're lucky enough to be there on a stormy summer night I highly recommend watching the lightening float across the clouds and crash on the surrounding Vegas mountains.  Of course there are drawbacks.  Drinks are expensive, and if you're not a rich looking guy the female bartenders will mostly ignore you.  The crowd seems to vary from spry young things to middle age male gawkers.  But, it's Vegas, what do you expect?  I've never found a lack of interesting people to talk to, and I welcome that I can actually hear what they're saying while booty-shakin' to some hip-hop that brings back college memories."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Im not sure how much it was to get in we got passes to get in from House Of Blues. When we got up we also got drink passes. The whole place is nice! You can step outside and see the entire strip! The inside is nice as well, big couches pillows nice seating area. I didnt get to eat there so i cant tell you how the food was."}
{"text":"We came to the Foundation Room as a part of a wedding reception. We rode the elevator up from the lobby of Mandalay Bay and it was a long ride, I knew we were going up high. The second you walk into the Foundation Room it feels like you've escaped from the crazy Las Vegas life downstairs. The lighting is dark, the walls are all upholstered with patchwork, and you're met with an enormous glowing Buddha.   The room for the reception wasn't ready yet so we waited in the bar. The server's came around asking for drink orders and they were very nice and helpful. Shortly after we were directed to the room where the reception was. Similarly to the bar, the reception room had an amazing view of the Las Vegas strip and the mountains that lie behind. We were served light hors d'oeuvres- things such as baked brie with crusty bread, a vegetable platter, vegetarian sushi, hummus, and chocolate covered strawberries. A server walked around with bruschetta, ahi tuna, and duck skewers. All of the food was very good! In the reception room there was a full bar and the bartendars were quite good.  Later in the evening we ventured out into the main bar and went out onto the balcony. I wasn't wrong when I mentioned earlier that were high up. We were at the very top of Mandalay Bay looked down upon the strip. It was absolutely gorgeous and we felt completely removed from the craziness below! I'd love to say that I will be returning here, but since it requires a membership I do not think that will be happening. If you get the chance to go, do it, it's beautiful!"}
{"text":"There aren't too many roof top bar spaces left in vegas, or so it seems. I like the laid back, chill vibe here. The foundation room is a nice little spot at the Mandalay Bay. The dress code is a lot more casual than other clubs like Marquee, Surrender, XS, Omnia, etc.  I don't mind the slightly older crowd at all. There's a lot less BS and almost no worries about someone doggin' someone else. Drinks are stiff, even if you're redeeming the complimentary drink passes that the girls get for coming in before a certain time.  Bottles here aren't too pricey.  I tend to come here after dinner with friends who aren't looking to get into something like a club but do want to go out. The view is pretty with all the sparkling lights. I haven't ever had to pay, not me or anybody in my group. I try and make contact with different promoters to get free admission for myself and my group. Of course a lot of that has to do with the ratio of women to men trying to come in but maybe I've just gotten lucky all the dozens of times I've visited. So...really, come here if you're looking for something easy going, casual, not EDM-y, and want a nice view. The view is where it's at!!"}
{"text":"Really, I give it about 3.5 stars.  The view is excellent, and as a Chicago based visitor I didn't think the drinks were all that expensive.  If you're that worried about what you pay for a drink then keep playing your 5 cents per hand video poker and let the casino drink girls bring your beverages for tips.   The view is great! Because Mandalay is at the far end of the strip, you get a full view of the casinos and lights, including the airport. (If you feel daring, you could always try and claim one of the private jets is yours in a pickup line).  All in all, the place is a more private area.  Yes, on Monday nights the public can get access but otherwise it is for members only.  If you have the opportunity to go, it's worth the trip and the price of a few cocktails. Just don't show up in shorts and tennis shoes or they won't let you in."}
{"text":"Been a frequent visitor to the foundation room for the last 7 years but this time they really dropped the ball.  I was attending my mothers post wedding dinner and they \"upgraded\" the party to a private room. The standard menu is quite good however in this case they completely phoned it in. Not only was the food below par but the private room was a cave. The standard dining room has amazing strip views while the \"upgraded\" room had zero windows, poor service and was a terrible experience. If you have a group do not book here and I will never spend my money here again. Further more, my mother is legally not allowed to comment on this due to their contract for large parties. Pre-meditated damage control?"}
{"text":"All I have to say is wow.   I'm not the club hopping, silk shirt wearing type of guy, but give me a view and a stiff cocktail and I'll be just fine. The Foundation Room has this interesting hidden jungle temple look on the inside and the outside it's more of a smoky lounge style vibe. Multiple couches, a bar and a view to kill for.    Like I said the view is ridiculous, you can see all the way down the strip and even watch planes land at McCarran airport. I came here during the day for a private event, but I can only imagine what the Strip lights look like at night. Or I can just look at the photos on their Yelp profile...naw, I'll just come back.   If you want to impress on a first date or show off to your out-of-town friends, this might be a good place to start. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Outstanding and Very memorable drinking and Dining Experience with the Best LV STRIP and city View!! Great decor amd ambience!! Fellows you cant go wrong taking your babe here!! Great steaks,  sea food appetizers and awesome deserts!! The Fall time Pear Tart is a MUST!! Service is Good too!! Have a great time dont miss this place and Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Mandalay Bay has created one of the most beautifully furnished restaurants on the strip. The view is at the end of the strip. Inside is what really makes this place unforgettable! Ancient artifacts with so much history fill the rooms. From the tables, to the carpet. It really is breathtaking! Parvati, Ganesha, Persian decor... must see! I recommend the crab cakes"}
{"text":"I've been to the House of Blues Foundation Room about five times over the past few years.  Lets just say the WOW factor has dropped.  It seems each time I go there the service gets worse.  The service isn't bad but it's no better than anywhere else.     The first time I was there it seemed like we had two waitresses waiting on us.  They would explain everything to you about the menu and help make choice if you were undecided.  If you left your table and went to the bathroom, your napkin would be re-folded and all your crumbs would be swept away.  If you ordered a bottle of wine it would be kept cool in a chiller.    Well all of that is gone.  The food is still good, but the wow factor has left."}
{"text":"Stayed at The Hotel at Mandalay and decided to check out this place. As everyone has mentioned the view of the strip is great - lot's of couples getting pictures taken on the balcony with the strip in view. The decor inside is very cool, dark and comfortable - nice place to relax and sip a drink. My only knock on this place was the service by the  two cocktail waitresses - neither one stopped by to ask us for another drink - thought maybe it was me or my brother LOL then I noticed they both avoided pairs of guys or women - they were only interested in serving couples I guess kind of funny and also rude."}
{"text":"This was hands down the BEST STEAK I've had in my life!! Got comped bc we got the intimate package for Carlos Santana at House of Blues. Mandalay Bay was not as busy, I'm thinking I know why,but nevertheless Shawn our server was prompt and knew we only had 1 hour to dine bc we made late reservations. Anyways always go with the steak here you will know with the first bite that they use nothing but quality in this restaurant/lounge.  The View is amazing too. It's on the 62 floor, took a bunch of selfies in the outside patio,yes outside patio (scary if you are afraid of heights like me) but you have to do the \"touristy\" thing any take as many pictures as possible. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"We were staying at THEhotel and got on the guest list on Friday to the Foundation Room when we checked in.  In hindsight, it was one of the best places we have visited during this weekend visit: no cover, no grease or table service needed, crowd and music were good, and drinks weren't overpriced.  The view of the strip from 20+ floor was nice (but soon got beat by the view from Mix, also in Mandalay Bay but on the 60+ floor).  They also have a few dancers to keep the scene warm and the guys happy."}
{"text":"Such an amazing view, such a horrible sound system and crowd. At least my drinks and entry were free"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for a special birthday for 10 people on a Saturday night.  Had made it months in advance with two requests - one a paper menu with no prices (has been done before for others who attended events here) and second was for a sugar free dessert option for the 70 year old birthday girl because she is diabetic.  Had multiple conversations with a number of people leading up to the evening including a woman on the day of the event at 2pm who confirmed they had those two requests were noted and there were NO ISSUES.  Then about 90 minutes before we were to arrive we got a call from an unapologetic manager named Jay who said who could not do either for us on such \"short notice\"  Seriously???  He could not have cared less.  Oh and he offered to let us bring in our own sugar free dessert if we could find it and they would only charge us $7 per person to serve it.  Needless to say we went to a different place that was happy to have us.  What a complete disappointment from a place that should be the tops at customer service."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and ambience was an A+ but the overly big bouncers were ridiculous. I lowered to three stars because of them. They literally shouted at my husband and were very rude after someone threatened to kick my husbands butt because the other guy was sloppy and drunk. We got yelled at like school children and were told to go where the other guy was hanging out ??? Really ??? Ummmm no thanks . The security(one guy) finally came to his senses after the steroids wore off and said we could stay where we were. duh !!"}
{"text":"This lounge is located on the top of Mandalay Bay hotel. The have a seating area outside in the open which provides stunning views of the Las Vegas strip.   We visited on a Monday and the service was quite good. I would recommend getting on a guest list which would get you free entry as a couple and sometimes free drinks. The interiors are modeled on an Indian theme. Most of it is well done but the murals/sculptures of Indian gods and goddess look quite out of place in a club/lounge.   The DJ was quite good and she was playing a good mix of Top 40 and hip-hop. We found this place to be more upscale than their counterparts in the city."}
{"text":"Not a bad view when you're dancing and drinking the Vegas night air away! I had fun here for sure."}
{"text":"Dimitri is the best Host! Love this place. Gorgeous view, great drinks and bomb music!"}
{"text":"I ended up here randomly after a promoter handed us passes with two free drinks when we were headed to Light. He told us that there was an awesome view so we decided to check it out.   I'm so glad we did. Foundation Room, located inside Mandalay, has one of the best rooftop views of the strip that I have seen.  Even though it was super cold out, we stayed for awhile taking pictures. The outside area isn't that big so it was crowded with people taking pictures.  But, bc it was also cold out, people didn't stay long.   The inside was packed and the music was pumping. It's got a really interesting Asian type ambiance on the inside.  Although do find it really weird to see one of my Hindu gods displayed in a venue filled with drunk scantily clad people. As gorgeous as the statues are, they're out of place.    Definitely check this place out for the view. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Sexy ambience, incredible view and delectable drinks. Expensive, no doubt about it...but if you come to a place like this in Vegas thinking otherwise you are delusional. I usually go to MIXX Lounge, but I think I might like this place better!  Perfect place to start a fun night"}
{"text":"So fun! Great view! Food was awesome. Staff was great! Get a table to rest your feet."}
{"text":"Are you interested in partying on the top of Las Vegas?! Literally speaking! On 63rd floor of Mandalay Bay you will find this hip & elegant lounge aka \"The Foundation Room\" ! I couldn't have selected a better place to be my 1,000th review on Yelp! Whoo hooo!   The Foundation Room has been from what I've heard an on and off members only establishment, however when I clarified if this was still something in place with the hostess at the entry of the club she explained that \"non-members\" are granted entry only if they have reservations for the Dining Room. Also, for the \"non-members\" If you are interested in going beyond the Dining Room and into the lounge area you may do so, just as long as it's after 10:00 PM.   Prior to my most recent visit I've had the pleasure of taking one hell of an elevator ride up here a time or two before. Each time I've visited this place there has always been a memorable moment created! My girlfriends were visiting from Atlanta, GA and brought me along on one of those wild and crazy Nightclub Crawl Party buses and this place was on the list! Go figure with that though because the spot to meet was actually at Mandalay Bay, so of course we would kick off the night of fun here!   After waiting not too long in the VIP line, we were finally granted access and went through the normal security check and lead to the elevators. It's almost like a nirvana when you take a step off the elevator into this hidden gem of a lounge. Dimly lit, you will find one center bar that has some of the most nice bartenders I've ran across in Las Vegas. The drinks are priced at the normal of what cocktails are usually in Las Vegas so no complaints on that. They have something called \"Nibbles & Sips\" hour Sun-Thu from 5:00PM-8:00PM so I encourage you to check that out. Music has always been great so I'm sure you can find something that will be played you can hit the dance floor to.   Last but not least! Make sure you take a step out onto the wrap around balcony and soak up that incredible view of Las Vegas! This view actually in my opinion has to be one of the best if not the best that the city can offer you. I'm sure there will be plenty more opportunities that I will return and I can't wait! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Top floor with great views. Small space with outdoor large balcony area and indoor space (kind of like Mix also in Mandalay). It's dark and the music is top 40 and EDM. Drinks aren't really strong. The crowd seems 30ish and classy. I'd come back. Had a great time."}
{"text":"Be careful... manager has a scam going.  Had no plans to go here.   Lured us in with free entry and free drink tickets.   They had an oriental screen by a door in a dark room which we knocked over going in. They said we broke it and charged us $200 for it.   Said pay them or goto jail.  They took our drivers licenses, made us sit down on a step on the floor and had 6 security guards bully us.  We paid... I wonder how many other people \"broke\" their same screen.    Horrible experience.  My friend cried all the way home.  It was her birthday too."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss! I honestly come here for the views and it is breathtaking with the views of the strip and a glass of wine at sunset what more can you ask for? Well that being said, food! But don't, because you will have a one hour wait time for a happy hour special of prosciutto which basically breaks down to burnt flat bread topped with lettuce and tomatoes! Which is what I had tonight. I complained to the waitress who told me it was not burnt but sent it back then when I tried to pay $25 on a $10 check  she took the entire  thing and didn't bring me back any change! When I finally caught up with her and asked for my change I gave her a $5 tip and she angrily pushed me in the hallway! So I told the manager on duty who was another woman in a pink striped shirt, she then proceeded to escort me and my friends out of the Foundation Room while I am telling her how rude the waitress was to me after tipping  her 50%! Wow I have never been so disrespected! Usually ppl are really nice in Vegas but this was an unpleasant encounter.    I do like the Foundation Room and found it a great place to relax with coworkers after a long day at work and watch the sunset on the strip but after tonight I am really disappointed and embarrassed for them. They did not deal with the situation in the proper way and I honestly I do not know if I would return or invite anyone here!  They were very unorganized and I literally dealt with three servers and a buss boy before I could get my order and received it burnt! I received excuses upon excuses anywhere from \"the kitchen is backed up\" to \"it's not burnt it's well done\" then they tried to kick me out when I complained. There was literally less than 50ppl there and the manager tried to tell me that my waitress had already left for the night so I couldn't get my change when it was only 8:20pm but I placed my order at 7:30pm! SMH What a Shame!"}
{"text":"The tundish room is the place to go in Las Vegas, the best view, the best drinks, the best atmosphere, and the best service. The foundation room is the only true museum in Las Vegas with over 11,000 ancient artifacts. If you haven't gone you got to go"}
{"text":"Long time favorite spot at Mandalay Bay. We hang out upstairs on all our Vegas trips. Members only club. Always an interesting crowd. The balcony has great views down the strip. Bartenders here make a good cocktail! Dancing is always fun here.  Nice lounge vibe with several different rooms."}
{"text":"I was here for an afterparty.  We did not have food at the party which was upsetting because I've heard great things about their food.  Inorder to get upstairs to the foundation room, you have to go through some pretty intense security which is nice but annoying.  They wouldn't let the media take their cameras upstairs.    The service upstairs was just what you want in Vegas.  Fast, funny, friendly, and good to look at.  Its hard not to give this place a 5 with probably the best view in all of Vegas, but without trying to food its hard to give them that full 5 star.  I would definitely come back and try the food.  You will feel like a boss when you go up there.  I am not a boss by any stretch of the imagination but i sure did feel like one!"}
{"text":"Went for drinks and dancing on 30 Jan 15, a Friday night. The place was packed, the music was cool and the ceiling was beautiful. Idk why, but I really liked the ceiling. It was raining so the outdoor patio area was closed off, making the rest of the room crowded and tough to get my dance on, my moves require lots of space.  The temp/air flow wasn't optimal, and neither was the carpet, for my dancing, I do a lot of heel work...But overall we had fun. I enjoyed the decorations.   Bonus*** Charles Barkley was there and he gave me a head nod. I would recommend getting one of these if you get be chance.   It was free to get in, the drinks were cheaper than most clubs and you get them fast. I wouldn't go back, but I would recommend if you're staying at Mandalay Bay or you're over the EDM super clubs, give this place a shot. Boom."}
{"text":"Best view of the Vegas strip by far.  Foundation Room is my type of place.  I hate clubs.  I think they are obnoxious and bring out douche-central. I like lounges, such as this.  Great music, outdoor seating aplenty, dark & swanky atmosphere and eye candy for all.  Cheers!  You just found the BEST place to hang out on the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"First of all it was a little confusing when I made the reservation, they have a restaurant and a lounge. Their website sends you to Open table and that reserves you a table in the restaurant. We got there after 10pm and that's when they close the kitchen, luckily for us since we didn't want eat too much that late. But this gives you access to the adjacent lounge which is awesome! I'm not sure what other ways are there for non-members, we'll have to figure out till next time. The lounge is scented, loud and sexy! Music sounds great, people around you are in a state of open inquiry and bliss and you'll get there too, it's contagious. We stayed mostly outside where we made friends with everyone taking pictures of the gorgeous view, a lot of them were from CES (the current convention that week) so we got to talk to some, it's great place to spend a late night on a special occasion."}
{"text":"Loved this place the moment we stepped foot inside of the elevator to get to the top.  Seven of us girls were in search of a great time and we found it here at the Foundation Room!  Advertised as exclusive and VIP, I thought to myself that surely they were trying to front like other Vegas clubs.  I drank my words as we were offered free champagne and cocktails while dancing to some hot beats!  FR offers 3 rooms with spacious dance floors and a patio that is perfect for their gorgeous panoramic view of the Vegas strip.  I admit that their dance floors are pretty small, but after several drinks you won't even notice the cramped space that has you dancing right up on another person :).  The aforementioned patio was a perfect place to get fresh air and if you can handle folks smoking in your \"fresh\" air (which was a bit of a turnoff but whatever), you get a chance to take in all of the magical spark that makes the Vegas strip what it is.  We ended our night here and wished that we started it off at this spot.  Great people, great atmosphere, and I would definitely party it up here again."}
{"text":"The food was amazing 1st time there with family. The best view, friendly staff, I would go again. The only thing I wasn't happy with is they have  a dress code. Very happy customer!!!!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar.  Very nice atmosphere.   Bartender excellent service warm and friendly.  Had apps  bar all excellent flavorful good eats.  If in Mandalay Bay you should go.  Great view on outdoor deck 64 floors up."}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions and it's cozy and has a nice view of the Strip. I've never had the food here though- just the cocktails.  It's got a very polished New Orleans feel to the place. It's like a lounge in the French Quarter meets Disneyland.   The venue seems to attract an older crowd but maybe it's me that's older and the nights I come here are for events that draw us old folks out of our suburban homes. Are you 40 or 50-something? You'll dig the low key atmosphere.  Are you a 20 something club kid? Probably not the place you want to be."}
{"text":"Went here on 9/6/15. Was sadly disappointed. We were in town for labor day weekend, and had a reservation for Sunday night. The rack of lamb I ordered was charred and fatty and flavorless all at the same time. The carrots were charred to a crisp. The squash fritters were pretty good. The plating was pathetic!! We went to Gallagher's steakhouse at New York New York the night before, and got a rack of lamb there as well, and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"This review is for a visit during Restaurant Week. We arrived 20 minutes early for our 6:30 reservation. Upon check in at the hostess stand we were escorted to the lounge and would be called when our table was ready. A peak into the restaurant reveled many available tables but maybe their policy is not to seat guests early and also help increase the lounge beverage business. The lounge has plenty of interesting art and a great view of the strip from the outdoor patio. At 6:30 the hostess escorted to our dining room table. The dining room also has an patio with an outdoor bar. Live music begins later in the evening. The artwork in the dining  room is also interesting. However, the room is tired and needs fresh paint and cleaning. Dust is obvious on some of the light fixtures and the light fixtures above the wall art could be better positioned so they are not skewed. Our server was Amanda and she was assisted by Otto. Both  were attentive and knowledgeable of the menu Otto was especially talkative and entertaining.  Both of us ordered from the Restaurant week menu.  The crab cake appetizer consisted of two large patties topped by apple fennel slaw and surrounded by an apple mustard sauce. This dish was light and flavorful. The slaw added a nice crunch. The 6 oz Filet of Beef was tender and cooked as requested. The baby carrots and cippolini onions were a perfect complement. The Shrimp Thai Curry main course was described as spicy by our server. It delivered fantastic flavor with a pronounced amount of heat. The large shrimp were served in curry along with eggplant, cilantro, mint and Honshimeji mushrooms. A separate bowl contained a large portion of jasmine rice. I highly recommend this dish if you enjoy a spicy experience.  The molten chocolate cake includes two chocolate ganache truffles, and two raspberries. The truffles just melt in your mouth. The cake could have had more molten chocolate. The calvados apple bread pudding with vanilla Ice Cream included a side container of warm sticky pecan caramel. When poured over the pudding it just melted the Ice Cream and soaked into the pudding. Just delicious and very rich.  The Foundation Room is more a 4 star than 3 because the food and service out shine the need to freshen up the space. Refurbishing would help improve the the overall experience."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm a regular here. In fact I was married here many years ago and was super close to buying a membership here until tonight. Vegas Strong my ass! Me and my girls came here after a Knights game and one of the bouncers was so nasty to us because we wearing Knights hats. It's ok to ask me to remove my hat, but this guy was so mean about it. That's not cool. He said if I didn't like it, I could go to one of the other many clubs in Vegas."}
{"text":"Can I just say that I have lived in Vegas for almost 4 years now and I have no idea that Foundation Room served food? Sure, I've been to the nightclub before (and it's a good place to take your older friends who just want to chill in a cool, loungy, not super trendy atmosphere) but a restaurant!? Blasphemy (see what I did there?)!  For my birthday this year, my boyfriend wanted to surprise me by taking me out to dinner somewhere special and he would not tell me where. Apparently, after sifting through menus all over town, he settled on Foundation Room.  While I'm told the main course menu is delicious, we just stuck to eating tapas style and ordered a bunch of appetizers to split. Of those, the Fresh Shucked Oysters and the Duck Confit are of particular note. The oysters were fresh and not overpowering. The Duck Confit is pretty much one of the best things I have ever eaten. It was so soft, flavourful and just melted in my mouth.  The service was impeccable and our waiter was one of the best I have ever had in my life. He was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, especially the wine list. I really appreciated how \"real\" he was with us. Usually when you are torn between two wines, a waiter will upsell you to another more expensive bottle, or try to sway you to choose the pricier of the two. Our didn't. He told us his honest, unbiased opinion of both bottles to help us make a decision without any underlying motive. That is always appreciated.   To top off a fantastic meal, the restaurant gave us a wonderful plate of complimentary desserts for my birthday and even gave us a deal on the check! It was one of the best dining experiences I have had in this city and I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving two stars because of the view. The service was horrible. Three girlfriends and I are staying at Mandalay Bay and decided to head up for a drink. We sat at the bar for quite some time and not one server came up to us. One of the girls went over to the other side of the bar where all 4 bartenders were gathered talking and asked to be helped. After 10 more minutes they still didn't come to take our order. Horrible service and not a great experience as a Mandalay Bay guest."}
{"text":"I'm not ENTIRELY sure what's going on here.. But I like it. The entire place smells of incense; I think it's coming from a vent above the door, and is covered with tapestries and carpets. My friend, who had brought me here for drinks, said when he called for information, they were able to tell him the origins of the carpets and tapestries.. But of course he couldn't remember it.   The music is nice, but definitely not something you would dance to. A lounge in the truest meaning of the word, there are several cozy sofas and fireplaces to lounge around, along with a balcony with a lovely view. They have some private rooms as well.. Mostly an older crowd, and a great place to meet a friend or colleague for a few drinks.   As for dress code, most people were dressed in \"party attire\", but there were also people just dressed like they had come straight from the office. Of course, it was quite early when we went.   Will definitely return."}
{"text":"On my recent trip to Vegas, a good friend took us here.  He  was able to get us into this place for no charge, since he is a member ($30 charge normally). First off, I have to say \"WHAT A VIEW!\"  and second, \"WHAT A VIEW\" . . wow, unparalleled unrestricted  views of the Las Vegas Strip that cannot be beat.    The Foundation Room is kind of hard to find.  You have to take a super secret velvet roped elevator to the top.  When you step off that elevator, you are transported to a very sophisticated  ultra lounge with middle eastern/asian decor. Its dark and serene.  Plush couches/seating surrounds you.  Step up to the bar and get your hands on a drink, then head out the doors behind the bar to the patio to soak in the view.  After enjoying a drink outside, head back in to the five star restaurant for some fantastic dining.   Your waiter will start you off with a complementary bread basket with a broad assortment of breads, even a soft pretzel type of bread which I really enjoyed. We ordered some appetizers: Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes, Oysters on the Half Shell, Cheese and Charcuterie tray.  Now for the entrees, we ordered Osso Bucco, Horseradish Crusted Steak, Lamb, Braised Mushrooms, Truffle Macaroni and Cheese and Grilled Asparagus, all of which were to die for.   Dessert had some interesting choices: Lemon Olive Oil Cake, Apple Bread Pudding and Molten Chocolate cake.  Strict dress code enforced, so dress nicely!"}
{"text":"I went there with some friends for drinks before going out. This is a pretty good place but rather small and very packed after 9pm. This place mostly plays Hip/Hop music.  This place is located inside The Mandalay Bay hotel and you can conveniently park at their parking lot (Paid!). The Foundation Room is a rather small place that is divided into an outdoor/balcony area on one side and a club/lounge area on the other side which makes it pretty interesting. Unfortunately, there is very little room to dance so don't count too much on that...   The best thing about this place is definitely the view. If you stand outside, you can get a view of the whole strip.  The drinks are good and service is ok, except when the place gets very crowded late in the evening. It can be hard to get drinks then. One good thing about this place is the decor/atmosphere which makes it pretty unique in Las Vegas. Expect to pay $12 for most drinks event though girls can sometimes get free drinks tickets.  In conclusion, I would say that this is a pretty good place to get a drink before going out and I would recommend it. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"}
{"text":"The view is the best of the strip. Its a kinda small club but I actually liked the intimacy that the small size provided vs the mega clubs thats standard in Vegas. The music was a mix which I appreciated, I dont like to listen to the same kind of music all night long. The drinks were kinda pricy but whats not in Vegas???  The foundation room is cool with me. Id party here again."}
{"text":"This review is for the lounge area only and NOT the restaurant or the food. My group and I didn't really like the place too much. Mostly because of the decor..We are Indian and didn't like how there were statues of Hindu Gods used as decoration. I myself am not very religious but I still have respect for others beliefs specially since some members of my family are Hindu. You wouldn't use Jesus Christ on a cross as decoration in a bar or club, then why have Hindu gods in a place that serves alcohol, plays loud uncensored music, and has scantily clad women walking around? I want people to understand its not the music, girls, or alcohol im against, This is Vegas and all of that is acceptable here and I always have fun with all three. BUT religious decor just doesn't belong in a bar, lounge or club. I liked the other decor but we all felt Mandalay Bay should have held out on the statues of gods and deities. Some of the statues we saw are similar, if not the same as, ones we see in Hindu temples, so to see them in a setting like this was weird and offensive.   This was the first stop on our party bus tour of Vegas clubs and lounges and Foundation Room has a very nice view of the strip. It rivals that of Ghost Bar and Voodoo at the RIo. 2/5 stars for the view and free drinks."}
{"text":"We went here to see the fireworks on New Years and paid $300 for me and my husband to watch them from the balcony. They did not tell us that it was an additional charge for the balcony. The security staff were really rude also. So we were stuck in the bar with no view of the fireworks with the worst music playing. Nightmare. The bartender was great!  But we will never come here again, nor will we recommend this spot. Poor customer service fail."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this room. It was nice that it was private and you could rent the space for a party, but it still had that dingy Vegas feel. The food being served was extremely subpar. There was no place to put used plates or glass wear. Literally! And no wait staff coming in to take anything for the hour I was there before deciding to leave."}
{"text":"We had a small 3 person crew and were headed into a show at Mandalay Bay when we were approached by what appeared to be a hotel employee with tickets to the Foundation Room. We listened to his pitch about spectacular views and dancing and great bar atmosphere. Ladies were free, guys were $20. We found the hidden elevator to the 63rd floor for this place, got to the top and figured out pretty quickly we had been suckered into something that was not a dance atmosphere, and the spectacular views were slim to none. The bar area outdoor patio was packed, very tiny space, and the view was not spectacular. The place was darker than any steak house I had ever been to which was a bit creepy. Very small bar, not many places to stand. All in all, I am confident they cater to a particular group, but it certainly was not what my group was looking for."}
{"text":"Yes yes!! Came here for the Ahern company Christmas party last week and had such an amazing time. Andy works for Ahern and we were lucky enough to apart of this evening. We started on the patio for drinks and odurves. The bartenders were so awesome! Talk about some girls with high volume experience. We then moved into the dining room and started out with a crab cake appetizer, amazing! I also let a server know of my nut allergy and every time I was served they assured me everything was nut free, I really appreciated that!  Second coarse was a salad. I don't know what they put in the dressing but it was mildly addictive.  Final coarse Andy and I shared both of our meals. A filet minon with mashed potatoes on his end and I had the Salmon with the jasmin white rice. Both were phenomenal. I must say the filet won. So good! We had a few cups of coffee and then enjoyed the lounge after. Such an amazing experience. The staff were so on point. We will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Staying at The Delano Hotel I was able to get on the guest list for the Foundation Room.  I tried getting dinner reservations however they were all booked that they could not accommodate my request.  Although, you can order appetizers in the lounge.   My girlfriends first arrived at The Foundation and decided to leave and have dinner at Mix on the top of the Delano Hotel instead.   Upon returning, the lounge and club area was packed and filled with a lot of people.  So a little tip:  (turn right)  When entering, you can turn right or left.  We turned left into the lounge area and made our way outside to the balcony.  What a beautiful view.  The DJ was jamming some good music and dancers were around.   Later in the evening we found out that there were other rooms.  We then ended up going to the farther room (if I had turn right) which seems brighter in lighting and better crowd.  Music was being played by apl.de.ap of Black Eye Peas.  The dance floor was bigger than the other room and I had more fun in that room as oppose to the first room we partied in.    Overall, If I was to stay in the Mandalay Bay or Delano Hotel, I would definitely return to The Foundation Room.  Great place to dance and chill."}
{"text":"Rating 4.5 stars I am digging this place. The night we went it was a Sunday night and the place was full but not overly so that you can't walk around the place. Lots of comfy leather chairs to lounge on, good music and a full bar that won't keep you waiting. The inside has dark and rich tones, lots of framed art- from the odd to the strange, decorated ceilings and lots of things that catch your attention. I like that they have some private rooms that is ornately decorated- seems to be a harem styled room-swags of cloth, rich decoration and lots of gold and reds. That night they had a burlesque performer...very fitting for this place.   The main attraction here is the view and the lights of Sin City. The view is spectacular...amazing. I heard the Foundation Room seems to be members only but once in a while, they do open this place to the public. If you can, go...it is nice change from the big clubs on the strip and the views will have you appreciating vegas a lil bit more."}
{"text":"Foundation Room at Mandalay Bay has one of the most beautiful views of Las Vegas. Camille, our bartender was awesome!! The DJ played decent music. It is a nice place to have drinks and mingle."}
{"text":"I've visited the Foundation Room and This Review is for the bar/lounge. Normally it is $30 a person to get up to the foundation room but we got in for free one of my companies clients had gotten us a balcony cabana .  Normally You would have to go to the house of blues gift shop first to get the actual vouchers. Then you go to the four seasons elevator area to he admitted. we got curb service! Once you get to the top & into the lounge it has interesting decor & low key vibe.  There are couches & a bar area inside but most people are out on the balcony to see the best view on the strip. the are private rooms but we didn't go down there the humidor was off the hook too but pricey   Since Mandalay bay is at the south end of the strip, you get a full and amazing northbound view of the strip from high up. It's fantastic.  The drinks are pricey ,bought 2 coronas and 3 mixed drinks it was $50 bucks Vegas baby!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends last night and overall was not impressed. On the positive side, the view of the strip from the balconies is gorgeous. That said - the food and service was disappointing. The waiter asked if we had time bound plans after dinner and we said no.  It was a mistake to be honest. It took almost 90 minutes from the time we got there until we got our food. When it did come, the fish was overdone for one guest, the steak was underdone for another, and the rest was just ok. They had run out of iceberg for their wedge salad which we were told about before we ordered, but they also apparently ran out of romaine for the Caesar as well - which we learned of when it arrived with baby lettuce. I get it's a first world problem but when the prices are high - so are the expectations.  That said the asparagus and tempura cauliflower were great.  The kitchen really needs to tighten up their operations and their management team could do better at service recovery. I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"A good experience, but the best part was the view.  I was recently in Las Vegas for a Bachelorette party, and the Foundation room was her dinner pick. The restaurant hostess was nice enough (maybe smart enough) to tuck us away in a private dining room where we could be as loud as we wanted. There the decor was outdated and kind of strange, but the views overlooking the west were to die for, especially as the sun when down.  It happened to be Restaurant week in Vegas so a few of us ordered from the 3 course Prix fixe menu for $50. The feedback from that was: the salad was ok, the steak was delicious, and while it tasted good, everyone was too full for dessert. I went rogue and split the truffle mac and cheese and the caprese salad. They were good, just wish the mac and cheese was a bit more truffle-y. Drink seemed to be the highlight of everyone's meal and they were average in price- $7 for a Beer, $15ish for wine and a cocktail.  The Bachelorette's future sister in law who couldn't make the trip was nice enough to order us a round of drinks and dessert from back home. The servers kindly orchestrated that fun surprise. But overall, service was a little slow. It was nice to not be rushed, but we were often wishing they'd walk by so we could order another drink and by the end we were just sitting around and waiting for our checks.   After dinner we went to the night club next door. Awesome view of the strip- pictures just don't do it justice! While we enjoyed the DJ's music, we left around 11pm to go to our next destination. The outside patio was pretty empty, but inside seemed to be bumping."}
{"text":"This review is only for the lounge.  Cool and hip decore, decent music, and without a doubt the best view in Vegas! The prices of drinks are expensive, but you are paying for the view and atmosphere. Not a place I would stay all night, but definitely a must do for Vegas."}
{"text":"AMAZING experience and best food. The staff there are on point with their service. Got there a bit early but was able to enjoy the lounge before we were sat for dinner.  Dave was spot on and his recommendation were the best. I went with a party of four and we all got something different. We were all able to sample each other's plate. Everything was great. I'm a purest and we all choose not to make any changes to our orders. Food was beyond amazing. If you have an chance to dine or every enjoy the Foundation Room. Go and don't look back. You will have the best time and want to come back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Came here once late night and had a ball. Was going out to eat but ended up here. Fun atmosphere. Not for the 20s crowd expecting a typical club scene. Was able to score seats outside and had some nibbles. View is fantastic, even for a local.  Came here a second time in the afternoon and sat outside. Certainly not as impressive as late night, but that's true of most things when copious amounts of alcohol are involved. There was also a large crowd due to a political fundraiser so a much different crowd. We were there for my bday. Nothing grabbed us so we headed elsewhere.   Enjoy that it's not as touristy as many of the other strip bars."}
{"text":"Great views and good food. Portions for appetizers were small or I'd give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing view, but that's all they get points for. Spent over 200 dollars for an unseasoned filet which had to be sent back because it was completely rare and we ordered medium, and when it came back, it was still well undercooked. New York strip was chewy but at least it was seasoned well. Scallops were underwhelming, and I am a huge scallop fan, but these were mediocre especially if you are paying $20 for only two of them. Lobster was very nice, but was hardly a meal saver. Had the chocolate cake for desert and it was nice if a little too rich. Service was very kind and friendly, atmosphere was quite nice as well, but food is everything when it comes to this sort of price tag, and I have had better versions of these dishes at just about any other place i've been."}
{"text":"House of Blues Foundation Room is located on top of Mandalay Bay. Once you exit the elevator, you 'll feel like you've entered some far-off land that blends elements of India with England and Ireland as well as the American South. There are beautiful sculpture and carvings of animals and humans.   The lounge area ie the main venue for drinking, socializing and dancing are covered by a patchwork of fabrics in deep red, orange and gold.  My favorite spot is the balcony, it truly is a must-see spot for the best view in the city. My friends and I were here last night for the Halloween Party. They had great music and free drinks for the ladies until midnight. The only thing is I wish the lounge area was bigger but what a great night!"}
{"text":"On a recent stay at Delano my girls and I went to Foundation Room for some pre club drinks. The view from the 64th floor is epic! (Mix has the same view but the lounge is most def not as nice) Music and drinks were totally on point. The atmosphere was super chill. The decor really funky and fun. Not really sure how much the cover is since my VIP casino host took us up but I know there are people downstairs always offering free admission. Whatever the cover though it would be worth it... Bartenders are super fun, friendly and make good drinks. Perfect pre clubbing lounge to get you warmed up for a night of shenanigans!"}
{"text":"Between the music and the view you can't go wrong. With so many places to compete for your attention in Vegas, the Foundation Room is definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"\"The sensor is like a clitoris.  Once you find it, you're all set.\"  This was what was told to me by the bathroom attendant as I was having trouble engaging the sensor at the sink.  I had to share the story with my friends once I got back to the table.  I was torn between a 3 and a 4 here.  The Foundation room is on the top floor of Mandalay Bay.  You need to be a member to get up here, but fortunately on our trip for NYE, one of our friends' brother had a comped meal so we all had dinner there for FREE!  FREE!  Ain't nothing wrong with free.  The pain in the ass was that it took us 7 hours to drive from LA, normally a 3-4 hour trip.  Most of us weren't going to wear formal shoes.  Yet that was their policy.  Literally, some of us were wearing t-shirts and track jackets, but apparently as long as you wear formal shoes, you can get in.  As we got in, we saw the person at the elevator on the first floor preventing an irate woman from letting her and her \"date\" in.  The food was pretty good and the service was amazingly fast.  The 8 of us ordered 4 starters, an entree each, and 3 desserts as well as several beers.  ALL COMPED!  There was nothing spectacular about the food but it was pretty good.  After dinner we went to the adjacent rooms and walked around the dance floors.  The music was super loud and people were partying the night away.  We didn't dance as we were tired, but we did appreciate the fantastic views of the strip from the top floor terrace.  Were it not for the stupid dress code (we had to rush back to our hotel to get proper shoes for our 10:15p reservation), I wouldn't be so torn about giving it a 4.  The service, comped meal, hilarious attendee made this a solid 4."}
{"text":"For the old world, exotic, far Eastern Asia vibe that takes you on the top of a Vegas resort hotel that glistens in golden yellow? Take yourself up 64 floors up Mandalay Bay! But not quite a place for everyone, for this is an exclusive club requiring club membership: The Foundation Room. Although you may get a chance to step foot in this through an event, pay cover charge, or VIP access, or via a Host, or a private party. (Recently held my birthday party in this venue!) With warm red furnishings' colors and purple-bluish lighting, plush furniture, a \"roaring\" fireplace in the main lounge overlooking the bar, an inspiring 1856 decor, 18th century paintings, walls adorned with buddhas, all cozy to take you to a faraway land. A large wooden chair by the elevators will accommodate at least three people, somehow made me feel like a Princess sitting on it. At least my friend thinks I look like a Princess he remarked after the photo. DJ music plays to get your dance groove on. Cocktails in the bar are quite reasonably affordable. The bartender and servers were attentive. Dining menu includes steak, vegetarian, and Asian, Indian,  Mediterranean flair served in white linen, white tableware, crystal stemware, and gleaming silverware. VIP host was accommodating and helpful in making my birthday party a memorable one. There are seven exclusive VIP chambers to hold your private party. Such rooms have the decors of Buddhas, stately Gothic style, Ganesh Prayer Rooms, and an 1856 style room. And best of all, there is the romantic feeling this club exudes. (It would be real nice with my love-y!) To top it all, extend that feeling stepping out onto the breathtaking spectacular view from the patio eye-ing the Las Vegas \"Strip\" as far as your eyes can see and see planes through your own \"bird's eye\" view of the McCarran International Airport. Hey, the plane, the plane! ...oh, planes! It's not the best view (it's the second best view as seen in the South part of Vegas) but Oh, but when the wind blows my hair in the way I like feeling it, it's just fine .. Feel like on top of the world! You, too."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite views of Vegas. A bit over priced, but sometimes you gotta pay for the environment.   There is an indoor environment that's very voodoo and the outdoor deck is a fun spot to hang year round. In the winter they have space heaters to help keep you warm.   Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous view and great decor inside. Definitely stop there for at least one drink while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We had perhaps one of our best dinners here with my wife. Steak for me and chicken for her west awesome!! The wine was good and the waiters were very kind and hospitable. From the door man, to the bus boy-we were treated great. Its an expensive dinner-people here who complain about the price, what were they expecting? Its not sizzler! Anyhow, definitely has the best view of the whole strip! The lounge was good too-we just had a great time and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was really excited when a group of friends and I were able to get on the list to get into the Foundation Room on a Saturday night.  While a couple of friends and I (both guys and girls) were waiting for the rest of our group in the Mandalay Bay casino we were given free passes for admission to the Foundation Room. I should have known there that they were desperate to get people in the door. My friends and I used the free passes to go up to the Foundation Room and wait for the rest of our party there.    I read some reviews before going, so I expected an older, more laid back crowd which was fine by me. What I didn't expect was to see people in flip flops and jean shorts. I understand not having a strict dress code, but at least have some. Yes, the view is really nice of the strip and the decor is pretty cool inside. It is a decent place to go to have a drink, in an intimate setting. In the end, I guess I was just put off by how \"exclusive\" it was touted then to see a whole bunch of people there in beach wear who got free passes."}
{"text":"Hands down the best meal I had in years. Ok I might have been stoned and drunk but it's Vegas! We had 9 dudes each one of us got a separate main course some of us shared huge steaks. I shared a 16oz ribeye but we ended up taking small sample bites from each course limb a bunch of different steaks NY tomahawk steak lamb pork belly wrap in bacon (must have) really it melts in your mouth! We got basically got all the sides but asparagus just cause no one like it but I think I would anything this place has to offer! Everything you would normally hate would taste good here unless it could kill u. U probably won't like it. And how did this place get 3 $$$ that's totally false our bill was close to $1000 so you should it here if you have some disposable income to throw around!"}
{"text":"what a strange place.. that doesnt seem to ever get more that moderately busy.. the patio is the place to be.. awesome view, great seating... inside its insanely dark.. like \"bad strip club dark\".. i saw vip spaces roped off and just wondered (with it practically empty inside)(the patio was full though).. why anyone would pay extra for a vip 'couch'.."}
{"text":"We had such a fantastic time at the foundation room our last night in Las Vegas! The rooftop is beautiful and is the perfect view to see the lights of the entire strip. The DJ was playing a fun and eclectic mix of songs to dance to. The only downside is there did not seem to be a dress code that evening so you had the full gamut of people wearing Las Vegas nightclub attire to people wearing shorts and flip-flops. It was also nice that ladies got in for free and two free drinks. Definitely a place to check out while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food is completely delicious although I don't think many places in hotels on the strip will be bad, especially with these prices.  The drinks are top notch, again I don't think you'll find anything of a lesser equal but what this place does have is service or at least that's what I found during my visit here.  The bar tenders took care of me and even though it was a packed night, I never waited long for my or my parties drinks.  The view is nothing short of unique with the entire first half of the strip in the distance which makes a perfect social media post.  It can get super crowded on that balcony though.  I would suggest going to the other side of the balcony where the restaurant is."}
{"text":"Why was i excited to go to the foundation room? 1) used to be members only- maybe the once \"exclusiveness\" sounded intriguing (maybe this should have been a warning flag) 2) LOVE the view at Mix and thought this might be another great one 3) received wrist bands from a guy at Mandalay Bay that gave Ladies hosted bar from 10pm-12am and were told ladies were free and guys were \"reduced\" admission for a steal at $20.   It was only 9:30 so the husband and I walked around and dropped some cash in the casino. We made our way over to the entrance around 10:30- no line, just a few guys that worked there. We walked up to the dude working there and I inquired about the hosted bar. He says \"we aren't doing that\". So I ask why they would give me a wristband that clearly says Ladies hosted bar from 10pm-12am and he repeats \"we aren't doing that\". So I ask if we can just both get in for free since this is clearly a bait and switch situation. He looks at me like he does not know what that phrase means. The husband says something \"polite\" and we leave.   Bottom line- I am rating the door experience only since I refused to pay for a hustle like that and you can get a great view and great service at Mix. You can also get a great view of the strip from the Voodoo Lounge. There are way too many great places and views in Vegas to deal with crap like that.  I love many of the restaurants and bars at Mandalay but this one sorely misses the mark. We will be dropping our alcohol money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"The view from the balcony is probably the best in Vegas but the prices are outrageous and the drinks were mediocre. Very cool atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Great Service and one of the best atmosphere's to dine in Vegas which is saying a lot. Might be a bit overpriced for the food, but again, you pay extra for the views and surroundings.  Go for the Bourbon and Creme with Cookies for Dessert. You wont be disappointed. Skip the Truffle Mac, there is better, and go for the Twice Baked Potatoes for sides."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday Friday the 10 th. Had an absolute wonderful time enjoyed vip table and bottle service.  All the staff was amazing especially our server Amanda Mu Moo, Tyshaun our security and Nina!  Thanks for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"So the view here is just WOW.  Totally the best part of the club.  I came here on business w/ a bunch of clients who took us out for the night.  We had a private room reserved and all the alcohol we wanted to drink.  The best part was passing up the line and having to wait about 0.5 seconds to get in.  I also LOVED how they let my co-worker in who had a pair of Chuck Taylors on.  And you know how Vegas clubs are..... no nice shoes = no entry.  Drinks were good since we had table service, so no complaints from me.  The decor was one of a kind.  I've never been to a club before that looked like this.  I kinda felt like I was in some kind of palace, and for a second failed to realize that we were in a club, lol.  The DJ was spinning some good danceable songs, but kinda switched it up too quick.  I saw some cuties here and there, and loved how some people danced even though there wasn't really a dance floor.  It never got too crowded and people were genuinely nice the entire night.  And oh, our waitress was mad foine and said she'd drink w/ me but never did.  Her loss.  LOL  Overall one of my favorite clubs in Vegas.  I'm glad I came here and would definitely come back another day."}
{"text":"I may be a bit biased since my husband is a member, so we get a bit of the special treatment, but I am a fan of this place for a few reasons.  Allow me to list them:  1.) Atmosphere: probably my most favorite thing.  The crowd is usually of an older age (30s - 50s) so it's not one of those BOOM BOOM clubs with 21 year olds going crazy and tripping off of something.  It's very classy and lounge-y here.  Around 10 PM, it becomes more of the nightclub environment and they take some of the bar stools away and some performers come out with shimmery, gold costumes.  The performers do choreographed dances, come out on stilts, and wear some weird 12-inch long fingernails which gives a burlesque type of feel.  2.) The View:  You are up on the 64th floor at the end of the Strip.  You can see down the entire length of Las Vegas Blvd.  Definitely a show stopper and a must see when visitors come to town.  It will make you look super cool to out-of-towners.  3.) The Service:  We've had the luxury of getting bottle service a few times, and the service from the door, to the host, to the bouncers has been top notch.  There is one bouncer in particular who I like the most.  I don't know his name, but he is hard to miss: a very tall, muscular, bald, Black man.  I once got caught in the crowd on my way back from the bathroom.  This gentleman saw me trying to squeeze through the crowd, took my hand, and personally led me through all the people back to our table.  On New Year's Eve, our host Wade went above and beyond to treat us well.  He walked us out onto the patio to a VIP area to watch the fireworks away from the crowd.  4.) Membership Perks: If you are a member, they have special events a couple times a month.  They are really cool.  Once they had a Kid's Night In and you got to bring kids up to the dining area where they had face painting, caricaturists, and balloon animals along with \"kid food\" like hot dogs and sliders and a s'mores station.  How often can you say you brought a kid to 'da club?"}
{"text":"By far best rooftop bar view straight down the strip. A little tight quarters and pretty loud inside, and VERY expensive drinks...but you knew that going in."}
{"text":"So I was in Vegas for a convention at the end of last month, finding stuff to do after work was no problemo, like, Clark County baby!  One of the only things I actually planned from home was a visit to the Foundation Room. I actually spent some of MyVegas rewards to get free entry for me and me Mam, and it was friggin stellar.   The elevator is probably the smoothest in the world. 62nd floor I think? The ornate decor kind of envelops you from the get.   Bartendresses were very sweet; I--naturally--did champagne, parental unit had a fresh raspberry martini that smelled heavenly, the berries popped so much it was almost palpable.  The view? Made you realize how stunning life can be. On top of the world. Go at night. Take pictures that make your friends jealous. Breathe deep and thank the lord for another glorious day!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot of the whole trip, and completely unexpected. A group of us made a reservation for dinner up here and I didn't know what was coming. We were waiting for the whole group and checked out the view - wowsa. Probably my favorite view of the whole town. Great angle because of where it is on the strip and how high this place is. Just absolutely gorgeous, ahh.  Dinner is on the other side of the floor, so we made our way over through the smell of incense into a dark room made light with the huge windows. Very quiet, very relaxed. We ordered a ton of food, meats and cheeses and such for appetizers and then wonderful different foods for the main course. Huge dishes of sides like mac and mushrooms to share. Beautiful dessert. Wow. I have to raise my glass for the steak though. Ordered it rare and it was probably the most perfect steak I've ever had. I could eat that every single day of my life.  There's a lot of expensive places to eat in Vegas. Make it count and come here, no regrets. No idea what they mean by members only since none of us were members of anything, but I guess you just have to be willing to come in a group and pay. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"This is one of the bright spots of my recent trip to Las Vegas.  Hidden well inside Mandalay Bay, this place is definitely a cool kick-it spot with a fantastic view.    We went there on a Thursday night and got great table service for our party.  Our lovely waitress was always around making sure our drinks are filled to the top and she is definitely a sight for sore eyes!  There were a few go-go dancers working their magic around the main room and they too are easy on the eyes.  Love the vibe...definitely very laid back.  Definitely tipped my cap off to the DJ playing his set.  The music selection was awesome!  Mix of current hip-hop and stuff from the 80's and 90's.  Wow...it was like going down memory lane when Easy E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube came blaring through the speakers.  Now comes the kicker.....the magnificent view from their outside balcony.  All I can say is....it's breathtaking and it's a great perspective of how life should be!  Have fun....keep your head up...and keep your friends around you close."}
{"text":"Cool lounge and best view on the Strip!"}
{"text":"Line up to get in the casino lobby for this. It's worth it! A bouncer takes your cover fee (if there is one) and checks your ID, before ushering you into an elevator to the top floor. There you find a club with a bar and a dj. The real draw is the balconey. It is shocking to find yourself eye to eye with the Mandalay Bay sign. It really sparkles! One of the benefits of being at the far end of the strip is that you can get a full view of the entire strip. It's stunning. The downside is that the balconey is a little small so it gets really crowded and full of smokers. It's still worth it for the view."}
{"text":"Love this place. The balcony has a great view of the Strip."}
{"text":"The Foundation Room exceeded all of our expectations. We made reservations for dinner for four ladies and were surprised when we were seated in our very own private dining room with incredible views for miles (the restaurant is located on the 63rd floor at Mandalay Bay). Our server, Leah, was attentive and made great suggestions. We had the seared scallops, bone in ribeye, and truffle Mac and cheese. Each dish was deliciously prepared and presented. Leah informed us that James, our host that evening, put us into the private dining room. James and a nice female manager (forgot her name) also helped us with a small issue we experienced with one of the bouncers. Overall, both James and Leah made our evening memorable and I would suggest the Foundation Room for foodies and those that love to dance the night away to old school hip hop and R & B. We will definitely be returning on our next trip."}
{"text":"Latest experience was terrible!  Came here to celebrate one of my buddy's birthday with a group of 8. The whole dinner was just terrible. First the hostess had trouble with our reservation and accidentally canceled our reservation. After that's worked out, we got our table. We were ignored for a long time, no menus or drink order anything. It took 10 minutes just to get the menus, then we asked for the restaurant week menu and first they couldn't find it and told us that it was not going on anymore, so I had to walk up to the front and ask a manager about it and then they were able to find The menu behind the hostess podium. Just seemed very disorganized.  Then it took another 15 minutes to take our drink orders and we were again ignored for 20 to 30 minutes after our drink orders were filled for us to wait to order food. After food was ordered we got our appetizers in 20min, then waited an hour before we got our entrees. Dessert then took another 30min and we kept asking our waiter about it and he would tell us 5 min and nothing would happen. Throughout the meal, our drinks were not filled, asked for extra napkins several times, and asked about our food order and was ignored. The 2 people serving our table was impatient, not attentive at all, and when they did come they had an annoyed attitude and did not meet most of our requests! For the caliber of this restaurant, the service is absolutely unacceptable!! Our dinner took 3.5 hours!!!! Insane!!  Not returning EVER!"}
{"text":"I had a great time having dinner here.  It is little bit pricey, but the ambience was worth it. The food was okay, and the taste was elevated by the ambience.  After the dinner, go to the patio, and have a seat at the sofa and enjoy the view."}
{"text":"We've been a member of the Foundation Room for years, but you don't have to be a member to dine here ~ anymore. Although we live in Dallas, we've probably frequented the one in LV more than we have the Dallas location.  This is a wonderful place to dine, and it's uncanny how they are always on the cutting edge of food one might not find elsewhere. From Christine at the host stand - - to the servers - - to the management, everyone is so professional, accommodating, and affable.  Jacob Kaufman is really a stellar operations manager; he is friendly, generous, classy, polished, smart, and VERY willing to make your experience memorable. The guys that took care of us, Alo and Shawn, were knowledgeable and flexible. I wanted my diver scallops prepared a a certain way. Not only did they accommodate us, the preparation was over the top!  We LOVE being a member of the Foundation Room! As an aside, this is absolutely (in our opinion) THE best view in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Attended a lovely dinner party here the weekend before last. Hands-down, the best service I have ever experienced here in The Valley. I have lived, partied, wined and dined here for over a decade. The staff at Foundation Room understands service in the most natural way. There's no inauthentic ass-kissing just plain and simple good  service in a relaxed, attentive atmosphere. The meal was excellent, the fillet was perfection and the prawns were a-ok. In addition to the best view in the city, Foundation offers a mature atmosphere for 30 somethings looking for a night-out with others who can handle their liquor and want to enjoy themselves."}
{"text":"I haven't really enjoyed the club scene much in the last couple years but The Foundation Room changed all that for me this past Friday. The music was a good mix to keep the diverse crowd happy and on the floor, the drinks were great and my bartender Brian was friendly and on top of his job."}
{"text":"I really liked the feel of this place.  Hubby and I were invited up so hey we weren't going to turn down seeing one of the best views in Vegas.  We were let in through the velvet ropes and took the private elevator to the top floor (66 or 67 floors....can't remember).  There is a restaurant but we were just there for drinks.  I would like to go back sometime as I am sure the dinner views are gorgeous.  The decor is very dark and comfortable...it looks like what I imagine the English men's clubs must have looked like in days of old.  Big comfy couches and chairs and a gorgeous wooden bar.  It is the kind of place you can have long conversations with your date or a great time with friends.  It was freezing outside on their deck to see the view and then we came back in.  BUT what a view! We will definitely come back when the weather is warm and sit and just soak in the view of the strip.  The only thing I did not like was our server.  It was not that she wasn't nice because she was, it was her behavior.  First the servers wear what look like lingerie with stockings.  This does not bother me...it is Vegas.  However our server was spilling out of the top of her outfit, I mean god bless her if she sneezes because everyone is getting a free show.  Anyway even that didn't bother me as much as it felt kind of awkward sitting there pretending not to notice the girls...and then she sat down beside my hubby touched his arm and asked for our order.  I am no prude but it just made me feel AWKWARD. So we were one drink and out.    On the whole it is a hip place to hang out and we will definitely be going back.  The drinks were good and the service fast and nice (And you may even get a free show ;)"}
{"text":"Love the view its not filled to the max with people and room to move around.  GREAT SPOT FOR VIEWS. They have a membership but you can get in several different ways."}
{"text":"First, I would like to start off this comment by stating that I only post on Yelp if it's really good, or REALLY bad. This, my friends, is unfortunately the latter.  The short version of my post: Foundation Room tried to play us for fools and ruined our dining experience.  The long version: (which I hope you'll read because it's quite ridiculous)  To start things off, my girlfriends and I ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir. Nothing fancy, just a $50 bottle that we were already planning to order more of (get Vegas started off right, right?!) So we order the first bottle and this is where the fun begins...  Instead of bringing out the bottle and doing the normal wine presentation that you're used to seeing at a restaurant, she brings out a tray with four pre-filled glasses that each look as though they have one shot of wine in each glass. She sets them down in front of us and leaves. My friends and I (who are no strangers to wine) just stare at each other in disbelief. She calls this a glass of wine? Where is the rest? There was maybe three sips in each. Maybe. Now, I know we didn't order their top notch bottle and I didn't expect their in-house sommelier to pour it, but I did expect to at least see the bottle and I did expect to at least receive the entire contents of the bottle that we were paying for and not just a portion of it. Everyone at the table knew instantly that there was no way we were poured an entire bottle of wine (unless, of course, it was the World's smallest bottle of wine.)  Now, since we had no proof that she didn't pour us the entire bottle (since she never brought it out to us and it was pre-poured in back) we ordered another bottle for our husbands and asked for new glasses. We also asked her for the bottle to be brought to the table(uncorked) and a presentation. Our waitress obliged. She came out with the new bottle, corked it before us and filled up the new glasses in the exact amount she did with the first four original wine glasses. And guess what, surprise surprise, after pouring the contents in equal amounts as the first round, there was still HALF A BOTTLE left remaining on the table. So our little experiment worked and proved that she did in fact completely scam us on the first bottle ordered--by filling our glasses in the back of the house and trying to pass it off as a full bottle.  We were obviously bummed this was happening, especially given the reputation of the restaurant, so in order to remedy the situation and not cause a scene, one of my girlfriends pulled the waitress aside in the hallway and told her we knew what had happened and that we just wanted things made right. The waitress completely agreed, apologized for the situation and told my friend she'd make sure it was taken care of.   Foundation Rooms remedy: Two complimentary desserts (which we didn't order) and instead of charging us for a full bottle for the first bottle, they charged us for four individual glasses of wine instead.   Now, why do people order bottles of wine instead of individual glasses of wine at restaurants? Because it's cheaper and you get more, right? So aside from the desserts we didn't want, their solution was to actually charge us MORE for the wine than what we had originally asked for. My blood pressure was through the roof at this point. The dessert was a nice gesture, but we didn't ask for it. I was completely fine paying full amount for the second bottle since we actually were able to enjoy it fully BUT BY GOD I wasn't paying anything towards something we didn't order, weren't able to enjoy and were just outright cheated on.  I gestured the waitress over, pointed to the four glasses of wine by the glass listed on the receipt and simply told her \"Mam, we did not order four glasses of wine, we ordered a bottle of wine. Since you and I both know we did not receive a bottle of wine, I would like these glasses of wine we didn't order removed.\"   Our waitress nodded, and without hesitation, FINALLY fixed the situation.  We travel to Vegas three-four times a year and needless to say, I do not recommend The Foundation Room and will not be returning.   I hope you find this review helpful and that Foundation Room improves their manner and poor service."}
{"text":"The Foundation Room Restaurant is for members only on most nights, however, the food, service and views is worth every penny. Truly, this place holds one of the very best views in all of Las Vegas.  The Foundation Room is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Nice view, OK crowd (could be better). Only upside is I got in for free."}
{"text":"My wife and I are members for the second year in a row.  Before joining, we would buy VIP passes for certain show that gained us access into the FR.  We love the place.  We joined at the first opportunity.  Like any private club, the more often you go the better the staff learns your preferences.  Sadly, we can only make it there a couple of times per month but the staff remembers our names and our drinks.    It is the premier place to see a concert/show in Cleveland.  Close and intimate.  Sometimes, the entertainer comes to the FR after the show.   The food is 5 star.   The atmosphere is eclectic.  The service is top notch.  There is a private entrance to concert venue from the FR which affords the ability to come and go during a show for no wait drinks.  Clean, private bathrooms.  Free coat check and more.  In the summer, there is a patio on the top of the HOBs that overlooks 4th Street for perfect people watching and a great view of downtown Cleveland.  Absolutely go if you get a chance.  Join if you can.  A great value and a fun time, every time."}
{"text":"We try to go here every time were in Vegas. Gorgeous decor and view down the strip. The service and food are both amazing."}
{"text":"We got free entry into this place and decided to have our pre-dinner drink here, since we were staying at Mandalay Bay anyway. It was a little early in the evening and the place was dead. We were supposed to get a free drink, but the bartender said that there was something wrong with the little cards we'd been given. When we saw the view from the balcony we decided to get a drink anyway. The view is spectacular. You can see the entire strip and a beautiful mountain-scape. It was totally worth the $7 I paid for a Coors Light.   I would check this place out if you're nearby and don't have to pay cover, but I wouldn't make a special trip or pay to get in."}
{"text":"I really expected it to be a better experience. But it was the worst. We went for my son's 21st birthday. I called to ask if we could bring a birthday cake and they said yes. When we arrived we were told that there was an $8 fee per slice. Nice! There were 6 of us and the bill was over $600. I had the lamb. Very disappointed. Barely warm and no flavor. I do it way better at home. No one ever came over to see how everything was. Not worth what they charge. Go to Del Friscos. That's a real restaurant."}
{"text":"Zero stars for this place and extremely disappointed and disgusted by them. Came for happy hour. The hostess said they are doing a special fundraiser to help people who have cancer with financial burdens. We told her my uncle who was with us has cancer currently, so it was good to see them fundraising. The security then said my uncle could not go in because males must have close toed shoes. My mom, aunt, and I have flip flops on. My uncle has woven sandals where barely any of his feet are showing the his toes are completely covered. What a disappointment and extremely upsetting."}
{"text":"Our reservation was for 7:00 and we had spent an hour on the bar side prior to heading over to the restaurant. We were told our table wasn't ready and to go hang out in the bar. I said we were just in the bar. I asked how long, she said she didn't know, they were over booked.  We finally sat down at 7:35. But the Manager came right over and apologized and said to order 4 appetizers on the house which was cool since there were 6 of us.  Apps and dinner were awesome! Highly recommend the mushroom risotto, crab cakes and the grouper. Once we got seated it was a great night!"}
{"text":"I got really lucky on Friday night.  I was with 2 male friends, and they had asked if we could go to a club.  I told them most places would charge us a hefty cover, and we'd have to wait in a big line.  Walking into the Mandalay Bay, we were headed for a bar and got intercepted by a host.  He offered us some 2-for-1 drink passes at Foundation Room.  When I inquired about cover, he hemmed and hawed and eventually said he could walk us in.  It was a few moments of confusion at the door, as I don't think he was supposed to walk in 3 guys, but it worked!  We made it up to the bar with minutes before 10pm, when the 2-for-1's stopped working, and we got a round of drinks.  $18 for 2 rum & cokes and 2 beers.  OK prices, but we wouldn't be sticking around for a full priced round.  I've been there before but they hadn't . Obviously the view is amazing, though I prefer the view from Moon at the Palms better as you get to see the whole strip.  Clientele was mostly older guys and their girlfriends/wives, but there were a few single people there as well.  Great vibe in the place.  Wish we would have gone back later in the night since had our hands stamped."}
{"text":"A group of five girls visited Las Vegas for a birthday party. Our best night was at the Foundation Room at the Mandalay Bay. Dennis DaSilva, Executive Host at the FR could not have been nicer!!  Wade Takamoto went above and beyond as well. So wonderful and accommodating to my entire party. The entire staff treated us like we were the most important people in town. Ask for these guys if you go.  My husband and I are Foundation Room Members out of New Orleans. We always ensure to go to the FR if available in every city. All are great but Vegas was such a treat!!  A must go with the best view on the entire strip."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Everything was cooked to perfection and all of our meals were top notch! The Lamb Shank was the best! Although it's a very big serving, it was tasty. Our service was just ok. We were seated right away but once at the table waited 15 min for someone to come and greet us. They apologized and said they didn't know what happened. The views are breathtaking!"}
{"text":"Per my review of Mandalay Bay:  A must, should you have the opportunity, is the Foundation Room.  The food - mmmm...my event was completely catered with incredible delicacies from Asian delectables, ribs, shrimp, and more to a the most lavish spread of goodies waiting to be dunked in the towering chocolate fountain.  Then there is the view......that's all that needs to be said...the view.  Comfortable nooks and rooms of historical enchantment suck you in and forbid you to leave.    It's totally chill and relaxed...hope you have great experience as well."}
{"text":"The food was average.  Fish was over cooked. Service was very poor as they never checked to see how the food was.  And they charged  our credit card so many times that  it got frozen"}
{"text":"Decent service and really good decor. Where this bar shines is the view- it's fantastic!  The bar was crowded, but didn't feel sleepy like some clubs can. Worth a trip for a drink and picture at the top, with some Vegas opulence mixed in."}
{"text":"Great place, with a great view, and quite possibly one of my new favorite places.  I visited this place a while back and never wrote a review for it, but since I just visited this place last weekend I thought I'd write a review(this time).  My friends and I were at the Nightclub and Bar Convention and one of the perks for badgeholders of the convention was a club pass for various clubs across town, which included the Foundation Room.  Upon entering the place, we went up and started drinking, and having a good time.  Took a bunch of good pictures in the balcony area.  I can't say how much the drinks costs, because I can't really remember how much it was or if it was free.    It's a great place to take friends to hangout, have some drinks and have a good time!!!!!! In the end it was a food i"}
{"text":"*** Review for Restaurant Week August 2014 Menu ***  The Foundation Room has been a place I've wanted to try for awhile and when I saw it on the Restaurant Week listing, I made my reservation for 6 PM.  While the elevator indicates it's on the 63rd floor, it's actually on the 53rd because this hotel does not use floors numbered in the 40s because of the superstitions of some Asian gamblers.  Greeted at the podium, I was told to go to the bar area and they'd come and get me when ready.  I took the time to explore the bar area and its eclectic mix of art.  It's really fascinating, funny, and very comfortable.  I also went out on the terrace to enjoy that marvelous view of the Las Vegas Strip looking north.  Soon the hostess came and got me and led me to my table on the west side of the room.  She gave me the option of sitting nearer the terrace windows but I was fine where she first took me.  Since the sun was still up, the shades were drawn but I still could see the peaks at Red Rock Canyon and Mount Potosi.  Later, the shades were raised for a great evening view.  On to the food.  Bread service was a nice basket and it was accompanied by a tray holding three dishes, one with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, one with garlic hummus, and one with sweet butter.  The hummus was great.  I'd rather have salted butter and there was no salt on the table.  I'll bring a fast food packet(s) with me in the future.  It's really a four course RW meal.  Everyone gets a Foundation Room salad with red wine vinaigrette dressing, teardrop tomatoes, and pine nut brittle.  The pine nut brittle sweetness was a nice counter to the tart vinaigrette.  Next, I chose the chicken tikka skewers served with pineapple ghost chili jam.  The chicken was marinated in yogurt and curry.  The chicken was marvelous with a great spice flavor and the jam was extra spicy which gave this appetizer a real zing to the beginning of the meal.  For the main course, I got shrimp and grits.  The shrimp was served with a chipotle sauce, again spicy and wonderful, and there were jalapeño rings with the dish.  The grits were very good.  This was another winner!  For dessert, I chose the molten chocolate cake.  It took awhile to make but that was OK.  More time to enjoy the view.  When the cake came, it was accompanied by some vanilla bean ice cream with fresh raspberries and two chocolate truffles.  There was little molten to the cake but it was good.  The ice cream was very good and the chocolate truffles were, too!  Service throughout the evening was good.  I was surprised that both a busser and the server left my empty Sweet 'n Low packet on the table but other than that, service was attentive.    This was an excellent Restaurant Week pick!"}
{"text":"Went to the Foundation Room for a work associated group dinner.  Usually those kind of events have so-so food, but this food was amazing.  The soup was a seafood broth soup (didn't get the exact name of the soup).  It was delicious and had a bit of a kick to it.  The salad was an arugula salad with pine nut brittle and a light vinaigrette dressing.  The breadbasket was also delicious with Italian crusty bread along with a version of a crusty raisin bread with delicious butters including an herby garlic butter and a cranberry infused butter.  For my entrée, I chose the beef tenderloin which was so juicy, tender and perfectly seasoned.  Mashed potatoes were served on the side along with a mushroom glaze.  The dessert was a little weaker with sorbet and gelato which was tasty but kind of left me wanting more.  The room itself is also very cool and \"rock and roll\"-ish with fabric on the walls and a private elevator you take up to the room.  Definitely a cool place to host a private party."}
{"text":"I planned a surprise party for my boss' husbands 40th birthday and after tons of research decided to have it at the Foundation Room. The staff and VIP host, Rick Landers, all went above and beyond to make sure the evening went off without a hitch. Everyone had an amazing time and we will definitely utilize this venue again when we have clients in town. Big thank you to everyone who made it a success!"}
{"text":"Had a nice time at this place... If you're looming for a view of the strip you can't get much better than this...  - bouncers are cool - great drinks  - amazing view  Lively with random dancers the night we went which turned the heat up on the spot and, coupled with our imbibing, got us in a great mood to get the night going!  Super friendly bouncers that keep everything going smoothly as do the waitresses.  Paul from Hawaii was particularly awesome and kept the outdoor area lively and feeling safe for our party.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went there last Sat. 6/23 and the food was the best I had in a long time.  We were greeted by Sean who totally remember my honey D.J. Farley when we walked in. Our waitress Jenny was amazing. Best experience I've ever had to date."}
{"text":"Good night view !! Service was good ! Best place for romantics date ,birthday ! When u visit vegas from other state you should try here !"}
{"text":"Just discovered the best view in Vegas and learned it is a bar and restaurant too! Attended an event here and got to sip on white wine and stare down at the Vegas strip. Priceless and very pleasant. The bar side of the Foundation room was where I was visiting. The event was a magazine launch and was done very well and could not of been at a better place.   The staff here was very pleasant and friendly. The bar atmosphere was very inviting and interesting. The places to enjoy drinks were very comfy and the red and velvet lighting was  nice touch to. I enjoyed white wine in the drinks I ordered with such great service too. I enjoyed cocktails and great views for well over an hour and could even sit and watch Vegas happen while knocking them back."}
{"text":"Located at the top of the Mandalay Bay, it is a small, intimate and beautiful venue.  Entry into this place was a courtesy for staying in one of their suites.  The only thing that detracted from the experience were the douchebag little boys at the door.   The music was great, not too packed, great service, beautiful surroundings...all make for a fine evening."}
{"text":"The 1-star should actually read \"negative ten.\"  Run by scam artists. To make a long story short, I ordered bottle service, they charged me several times the price listed on the menu claiming I ordered from the \"dinner service menu\" versus the \"bottle service menu.\" Never mind that this was what they handed me and what I pointed to. Managers were rude, unapologetic, and if it wasn't for the kick-ass cocktail waitress, I wouldn't be sad if the entire place burned to the ground with everyone in it.  Also this is allegedly an exclusive members-only club. This turns out to be a loose guideline as the slimy bouncers were trying to wave any skirt passing by through the doors. By the time we left the place was a douche factory.   DOUCHEBAGS. GO TO HELL."}
{"text":"I love this night club. They have an awesomely awesome outside balcony on top of the Mandalay Bay. The view is amazing up there.   The indoor club has a Buddhist, Gothic flair to it and is also decorated as such. From the main room you can access smaller private party rooms that aren't open to the public but are for reservation only.   The crowed seemed to be a little older that the average night club crowed and it was really nice. Dress code is party, dressy attire."}
{"text":"We were introduced to this place by a good friend during my recent trip to Las Vegas. My friend was able to get my date and I into this place for free ($30 charge normally). Our reservation was scheduled for 7 PM so we arrived at approximately 30 minutes prior to our reservation. This allowed us to hit up the lounge arrange which arguably has the best view towards the Las Vegas strip. For the view alone and the pleasant lounge area, I'd strongly suggest you come here. The day after, my date and I went to Bubba Gumps on the strip. That is where I looked across towards the Mandalay Bay and realized how high this lounge area is. Amazing!   Now, the decor inside was dark (intimate) but I'd say some of the interior furniture and decorations were outdated, thus the dark lighting? Not sure. The service was excellent. Our dinner started off with a complementary bread basket which I can always appreciate. I requested that bread be warmed up and the server complied with the request. My date's Martini was accidentally spilled, the server kindly brought out another Martini for us. Major points for that!  Food: We started off with a Ahi Tuna Snap Pea Salad and an order of their Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes. Personally, not impressed with either dish. The server noted one of the specials of the night which was a 22 oz. Porterhouse steak which we ordered. but yet didn't realize that it was a $72 order once we received the bill. Being that the 16 oz. T-Bone steak was listed at $55, $72 doesn't sound so bad especially since my friend was able to get us a $100 gift card and a bottle of '09 CA Pinot Noir from Sonoma County which was totally was unexpected. Bonus for us. The sides we ordered along with the steak was the Truffle Macaroni and Cheese and the Grilled Asparagus which were excellent and strongly recommend.   Being that Vegas hotels nowadays charge for items such as internet access, club entry, gym and/or pool access, etc., with the view alone, $30 is entry fee is not such a bad deal. I'd say, if you've never been, go and at the very least, enjoy the fantastic and very unique view towards The Strip. $$$-$$$$ for food so be prepared."}
{"text":"Amazing bar and lounge on the 64th floor!! The front desk girl told us about this gem when we were checking in!  The inside is romantic, comfortable, dim lighting and cool ambiance. It's a must see! Ya know what else is a must see?? The balcony! Its amazing! There's couches and tables that you can reserve and the balcony overlooks the whole strip. We stood out by the railing and sipped good cocktails while chatting with some other people. It was a great experience and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"4 1/2  Stars if I could.  This is a must for dinner in Vegas no matter where you stay.  The view is incredible, food is predominantly well executed and creative, Corkage fee only $35, and service and environment are truly unique and excellent.  Although they pride themselves on the steak, I thought the filet was just above average and did not come close to the requested temperature (ordered medium and got rare).  Most of the apps were fun and creative, although a bit shy of wow.  I will say the short ribs might be the best I have ever had, and I have had a ton.  Foundation Room, Jose Andres E', and Olives are my favorite off the beaten path Vegas dinners."}
{"text":"Find a member. Also find the hip-hop room... its mysteriously hidden and has a VIP section. Find a way into there.  Don't go to Vegas without checking this place out. \"Members Only\" did not die out in the 80s."}
{"text":"3rd time here and another great experience.  Also our server Alo was the best yet. Great food, great at atmosphere, great service and great views."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars. Located on the top floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel. I've visited the Foundation Room several times in the past years. The industry I'm in was having a conference of seminars for three days.  One of our main suppliers invited me to a cocktail party and dinner here since they had clients visiting everywhere from North America. Our supplier reserved the entire patio and dining room for the night which was a private event.    We started out on the patio where we enjoyed various appetizers and an open bar for about an hour. This private lounge and patio has spectacular views of the Las Vegas Strip and the weather was perfect. After a few cocktails and small bites we moved into a large beautiful decorated room where we enjoyed a four course meal. Overall the meal was solid and the service by our waiter was outstanding. He tended to every reqest our table requested including providing IPA beers and specialty mixed drinks.  Overall the event here was excellent and was executed without any hitches.  If you have the opportunity to experience the Foundation Room, definitely go for it!"}
{"text":"As far as Church Dubstep is concerned I am a HUGE fan of this place. It's like you're literally partying at church. Of the two rooms, this place has vintage carpeting, gothic church furnishings, and a Victorian styled ceiling with an awesome chandelier hanging from the center of it. They had a platform changed different shades of neon color while a dreadlocked go-go dancer moved to the rhythms of the music.  This place was hard to find. My friend & I hard to ask 3 Mandalay employees before we found the small hallway where the the entrance (elevator) was. As for the other room, I passed it for a second but it looked like it was themed after a Buddhist temple."}
{"text":"I was surprised by the decor/vibe in the Foundation room, but surprised in a good way.   Nothing about the decor, staff, or ambiance is typical club/bar, especially for Vegas. Our visit there came just in time, as I was getting tired of beach-themed bars filled with bachelorette parties.   Get the most out of the slightly higher-priced drinks and go out on the balcony. The view is a-maz-ing, and the couches/loungers are inviting. I also thought sending the dancers out to the balcony so we didn't miss them was a cool move.   My brother and sister-in-law's whole wedding party was invited up to the club. I'm not really sure what gets you in, but it seems a tad exclusive, and I'm not gonna lie, that was nice."}
{"text":"A joke when compared to so many other clubs in Las Vegas--though the staff were attentive and good with a VIP table we had.  Smallish, low ceilings, mixed crowd.  Yes it has a nice view of the strip, but that only adds a star--without it, the club would be a one star experience.  Moreover, the VIP booths can't see it because a bunch of folks stand in the way.  Restrooms are dirty as well.  Don't waste your money or time.  Evaluate the clubs clearly around Vegas--as there are much, much better choices."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first night we had dined at the foundation room & Barrett was our server. He was great! He was very informed & professional. His assistant server was great too. For dinnner we started with the crab cakes, then my fiancé & I split the 16oz ribeye, with a side of asparagus & truffle Mac and cheese. For dessert we had gelato: bourbon vanilla, cheesecake, & caramel banana.  Everything was wonderful!! We felt that we had the best experience & after we had dinner we went across the hall to the lounge where we enjoyed some cocktails & the stunning view. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great view but the bartender was extremely rude. Pretty disappointing,  we ended up wanting to leave because she was so rude."}
{"text":"We love you Maurice!!!!!!! Courtesy of Maurice, my friends and I were escorted here Friday night on our club hopping tour of the Mandalay. We had just come from the Mix and I have to say that this place put the Mix to shame. The crowd inside were really nice and the music and the decor were great. My most favorite bit were the private rooms found down a long hallway. One was left open and unattended so we snuck in and savored the plush couches, chairs, cushions, piped in music and a view to die for.  I was in awe because I have never been clubbing in Vegas, and this was a great way to start off my vacation weekend, and I will be recommending it to my friends."}
{"text":"This place is racists!  They kicked me out just 5 mins ago... Their reason was that i was \"intoxicated\"...seriously? I'm sitting here fuming!  F****u, I'll take my $ else where!"}
{"text":"Three words ...was not impressed.  I expected way more since it's a \"private club\" in Las Vegas.  The staff was nice, however the drinks were expensive (which I expected) but the vibe was fake and superficial.  Don't waste your time, on the other hand the Ri Ra Irish Pub was a better spot to hang out. Live music and a relaxing vibe which was very nice after a long day.   It doesn't have the view of the strip, but believe me there was a view.  :-)"}
{"text":"Spurts of fun music...had to leave towards midnight when the music got pretty terrible.  One of the bartender ladies was helpful and accommodating (dark brown hair).  But the music...just awful."}
{"text":"good music, not super smokey, best view in the entire city"}
{"text":"Had a really great time here with my friends who are members. Super exclusive and posh, really beautiful. Had some drinks and enjoyed the amazing view before, during and after the sunset.  Had dinner here in between. We split a wonderful bottle of red wine and had a cheese board to start. SO delicious and interesting. Probably not worth the price, but really really good (especially if you have some extra money from your winnings!) I had the filet, it was O.K. not the best I've ever had and probably a little overpriced. We shared some mac and cheese, which was super heavy on the truffle. When it comes to truffle oil, more is not always better.  Anyway, it was a nice meal and a good time. We had fun and the view is gorgeous. I'd go for drinks, but I think there are better places (for the same, if not cheaper) for the amount of money you're spending."}
{"text":"The food... Wonderful. The waitress... Pleasant, knowledgeable and efficient. The ambience... Dreadful.  We were greeted first by a sign saying there is a zero tolerance policy for drug use and lewd and lascivious behavior. Oh my. What kind of restaurant had the Concierge recommended? We took the elevator up and, as we were a bit early for our reservation, we were ushered to the outside lounge. I was afraid to even brush up against any of the furniture there- so filthy with embedded food particles, dirt, stains and cigarette burns. The menu we were handed was also dirty with stains and smudges of an unknown origin. The bartender was dressed in a dominatrix type outfit - I was afraid that if she sneezed, her black corset top would have a 'wardrobe malfunction.'  The hostess who came to escort us to our table appeared bored with her job and inconvenienced by our presence. The decor of the restaurant is dark, dated and worn. There was a musty odor reminiscent of a gym - the place is badly in need of a good airing out. The paintings on the wall are dusty and very somber. There are some large Buddha figures but I'm not sure why. All in all the ambience was quite creepy. Did I mention the food was good? But there's lots of restaurants to choose from in Vegas - this is one and done for me."}
{"text":"Very pricey, but the food and the service was excellent.  You get a great view of the Vegas strip.  Nice little outside seating area to have a pre-dinner coctail."}
{"text":"I honestly don't think we made it far enough to see the view, they had a classy nice atmosphere though and we made it through VIP with no problems at all."}
{"text":"100% Ambiance. Decadent Asian Decor. Location. Exclusive. Visiting- priceless. I came here twice.  The best view of the Strip. You know those letters \"Mandalay Bay\" on the casino, that's where the Foundation Room is!   Imagine rich tapestries on the wall featuring elephants (think of India, Bali, Indonesia, Singapore), huge Buddhas, rich dark mahogany wood, custom crafted furniture, plush fabrics, a few private rooms for entertaining, a DJ spinning, pricey drinks ($10- $15 ea.), and a gorgeous view of the Strip (yes, you can go outside, on the balcony). It's a very unique experience and everything is so beautiful. We just went came here for drinks and ambiance."}
{"text":"Place is a hidden gem.  Very cool spot to hit up before a show.  They have food but Ive yet to try.  They dont even mind if ya breakdance there..."}
{"text":"Went her for drinks and a dinner party.  Good time with great views down the strip. Probably not the best club in town, but still a great place to have a drink and relax.  Got louder and more crowded later."}
{"text":"I went to the Foundation Room for the first time on Valentine's weekend and had a wonderful time.  I ordered a bottle of an delicious Cab and the Short Ribs. They tasted so good together.  I loved the assortment of breads they brought at the beginning of the meal.  SERVICE: Great service.  It's a 'fine dining' restaurant and the service was up to par.  I felt like I was well taken care of.   VIEW: AMAZING views of Vegas.  You're up so high.  If you want a NICE dining experience then this is the place to go for something special.  The food is good and the views and ambience of the restaurant will make you feel like you are having an elevated dinner."}
{"text":"Came here last night. Neat place! The balcony has an amazing view and it's extremely neat that's it's up on the 63rd floor. No seating as they closed all the couches off for bottle service. Not sure if it's always like that or because it was a Saturday. We got on a guestlist and got free entry and the ladies two free drinks between 10pm-12am. They did have heaters outside if anyone was cold. Small space but very classy. Good music and bartender was awesome. Drinks are as usual on the strip, $10+. Nice place, will be going back. Got very crowded very fast. Opens at 9pm so get there then if you want a good spot on the balcony overlooking the great sincity."}
{"text":"I love the Foundation Room, I had been waiting to hit this spot for a while; glad I did. The place was packed and the music was slamming. I don't remember how long I stayed but it was a good while. The drink prices were descent considering this is a hot night spot on the strip. I was put on the guest list so there was no cover which is always a bonus; I went twice during my trip. My only issue was that on the last night i went there were no seats at the bar or other seating other than VIP; I like posting up at the bar and without a seat you had to keep moving so other people could get drinks; no biggie though as the good outweighs the bad. I'll definitely be back.   The balcony is also a nice place to be but seating is very limited."}
{"text":"Knew of this place from some friends who frequent and from watching fights (the view from FR is very familiar when they show fights from MB hotel /casino ) Made Reservations really easy. Wife had salad and gazpacho  (very spicy) and I chose the pan seared chicken. Both dishes were really good. But service was just not hitting the mark for the price point(-1). Also with a room less than half full instead of seating us at a window they put us against wall between 2 windows with mutilpe open tables on each side. (-1) when we finished we went to the lounge next door and I noticed all females  were getting free drinks but not one offer to my wife. When I went to bar again security person even asked my wife to get off the love seat she was on for bottle service then let a couple sit there with a beer and cocktail NO Freaking Bottle! ..( -1)  I guess it's who ya know. ..DJ and the view is who gets the 2 stars. I could've got better food and services other places."}
{"text":"Booked reservations for 8:30 at night with a 3 hour notice. This place was delicious and the serving size of the food was perfect and fulfilling. The crab cakes were so good. The salads we ordered were great as well. The halibut was a good size and the meal was delicious. I had the chicken and it was like chicken,  I have never tried before melted in my mouth. The view of the strip was amazing and beautiful. This is a very nice place and I strongly recommend this place if you get a chance. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Hi there - the ambience is fantastic and the views incredible. The lounge outside is awesome. Service is ok and the food was ok. It was not as expensive as I was expecting from the reputation it has so that was good. The asparagus was amazing but I am not sure I would go again just for this item, I think once is enough."}
{"text":"Located in Mandalay Bay on the famous Las Vegas Strip. This place is a must do. One of the grooviest views in Las Vegas! Great food, great drinks and fantastic events! The interior decor is worth its own exploration, just don't get lost, we may not find you until dawn. Of you are a Las Vegas local be on the look out for events here, and when you find them, RSVP and go! Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"The first time you come here the first thing you notice is the decor...kind of funky.  Personally, I like the patio area best because when it is busy the inside is just dark and crowded."}
{"text":"A nice restaurant for an upscale date night or dinner with friends.   We made reservations for Saturday evening and checked in at the counter on the casino level. We were led to the elevator and up to the very top of Mandalay Bay. The vibe up top is very unique and is best explained by looking at photos.   To begin I ordered a glass of Merlot and my husband ordered a Cucumber Chill. I was surprised to find that there were many reasonably priced wines by the glass to choose from on the menu. The cucumber cocktail was delicious and refreshing. We were also brought a bread basket with a couple of types of bread including pretzel. Alongside was hummus, oil, and butter.   The Foundation Room Salad for me and Caesar Salad for my husband. Both were large portions for starter salads. My salad had Bibb lettuce, other assorted vegetables, and a delicious vinaigrette. My husband enjoyed his Caesar as well.  I enjoyed my Center Cut Filet very much. It was well seasoned and juicy. The Pomme Puree side was creamy with a lovely butter flavor. My husband ordered Pan Seared Diver Scallops and really didn't enjoy this dish. He thought the scallops were a bit rubbery and generally not the best scallops he's had.   The finale for the meal was the highlight for me. My husband pretended to be healthy with a generous serving of Fresh Berries. I enjoyed the Calvados Apple Bread Pudding and wished I had saved more room. This was one of the most delicious desserts I've had in awhile. The bread pudding was delicious, but the walnut caramel sauce put the decadence over the top.  Our waitress was very friendly and warm. She made us feel very welcome and the amount of times she checked in on us was just right. The man assisting her was on top of filling waters and clearing plates as necessary. They definitely met my service expectations for a nice restaurant.  Overall, the restaurant lends itself to a nice plate for a date night or peaceful meal with friends. Check out the lounge down the hall after dinner for one of the best views of The Strip!"}
{"text":"Monday night in Vegas? GO TO THE FOUNDATION ROOM... that's if you're lucky enough to get in.... If you're a guy expect to pay at least $30. Girls can get away with less, but if you want to wait a little less than be prepared to spend about $20.  This club is AMAZING! I know this analogy might sound lame, but if you were ever a fan of the Osborne's... you might just like this place. Being at this club reminded me of partying at the Osborne's house. There were even fireplaces and couches... OH SO COOL.  Our favorite room of the evening? The House Room... it had the best view of LV in all it's glory! Music was good, too... think Lily Allen House remixes... Loved it!  The hip hop rooms were fun, too...  one was overly crowded but fun no less!  This place is now my second favorite to Tryst! :)"}
{"text":"What a great place. The staff was so friendly and accommodating. One of the best lounge experiences I've had in Vegas. The view on the balcony is amazing. Will definitely be back. Huge thanks to James and his team!"}
{"text":"Great views have been coming here for years.  The staff is very friendly the only reason its not a five star it needs a little TLC or just a small facelift."}
{"text":"Best part about this place is the fact that Mandalay is at the end of the strip and the balcony @ Foundation Room gives a gorgeous view of the entire strip making a great photo-op."}
{"text":"Went for drinks and to enjoy the view.   Both were excellent."}
{"text":"Great view of the strip from the balcony.  The environment is great.  The crowd is interesting."}
{"text":"This club/bar was on the club tour that we were on. It was actually the last place of the night.I didn't know much about it, so when I got to the place, I wasn't aware that it was on the top floor. The night I went, the music was definitely on point and like everyone touched on, the view of the Las Vegas strip was pretty amazing. Me and the people that I was with just chilled on the outside area with the couches for the night and just danced to pretty good music. Would definitely go back again"}
{"text":"This place is an institution in Vegas, and you simply haven't lived life to the fullest until you've been here.   WOW, WOW, WOW is all I can say.  Amazing view and a brilliant place to enjoy a proper cigar after 10:00 PM (due to local laws).   The drinks are expensive for non-members ($15 - $26 each) and the cigars in their humidor are just mediocre, so I recommend going downstairs to Davidoff to get a proper smoke (which can bring up - just don't light up in advance). I enjoyed the La Spann specialty drink I had there even if it was a bit overpriced.  I got a wonderful tour by the manager, Steve, and this place is brilliant. You definitely feel like you are Robin Leach living in the lap of luxury.  The membership fees are very expensive, but might make sense for certain businesses who want to wow clients in the area.   There does seem to be a large number of non-members in attendance which diminishes the value of the membership. However, I'm thankful as I'd rather pay the $30 to be able to visit than to be required to have a $1500+ annual membership.  The view from the balcony is simply the best I've seen in Vegas (but The Hotel at Mandalay Bay is roughly the same view).   I didn't try the food and I wasn't there for the live entertainment.   It was very crowded after 10. It's also a sausage fest so expect to see a lot of middle aged men in large groups and very few women.  The waitresses were terrible and inattentive unless you have table service and are ringing up $1000+ plus bills on booze (which is very easy to do).   The membership doesn't make sense for me since I don't get to Vegas much, but I'd love to go back. It was definitely the highlight of my trip and a pure joy.  It's a great place for business networking as there were a lot of influential business people here, so that may be another reason to invest in a membership if you travel frequently to Vegas."}
{"text":"My friends and I were lucky enough to get free passes to go to the Foundation Room on a Friday night. We'd gotten dressed up to go to another club, but when we stepped out of the elevator bank a promoter came up to us and handed us four passes for no cover charge.   Although the club was a little smaller than I thought it would be, the view was fantastic and the drinks were reasonably priced for Vegas. You can see most of the way down the strip, and it wasn't too packed since it was still fairly early. Only one table was reserved, so there was plenty of seating in the main room, at the bar, and outside on the open balcony. It's not your typical nightclub, but it's definitely a great place to start your night at if you get lucky with free passes."}
{"text":"Just came for some late night fun a while back.  I had a connection that was able to get me and and a big group of people in for some drinks.  There isn't anything too crazy special about this place that you can't get at another roof top bar.  Has a nice view and upscale decor.  It's supposed to be exclusive, but I don't think it's too hard to get in.  There really isn't a strict dress code.  There were some girls in jeans and long sleeve shirts in there."}
{"text":"Just go for the view.  Right after a work conference at the Mandalay, my husband and I were aimlessly wondering the casino floor when one of the promoters came up to us. I casually began to walk off until 'best view of the Strip' perked my ears. It was nearing sunset, and why not? We didn't have anything to do!  They have an amazing view, and at like 5-6pm it was empty. We got one of the signature cocktails - which tasted OK in terms of craft cocktails, but definitely was full of alcohol so I guess you get what you were paying for (not watered down.) The atmosphere is really comfortable and the outdoor patio is wonderful.  I'll bookmark it as a stop, even if for the photos alone, for my trips to Vegas."}
{"text":"My friend and I were offered free passes to this over and over till we finally took them in case we needed a back up to the nice looking lounges I had found at other hotels. As it turned out, we did try it and it was definitely not worth the effort. It's a super tiny, cramped, and filthy couple of rooms with a minuscule patio area that is cram packed with whores and their frat boy looking pimps. Yeah, you can see most of the strip, but through curtains and curtains of moths, so if you can palate that, GREAT FOR YOU! I'd prefer to see the view from the ground where a sheet of moths are not obstructing my view. So, go here if you LOVE moths, whores, and sleezy horny mid-west frat boys who clearly couldn't get laid at any other city in the world. The drinks were rancid and expensive and we left after 25 minutes. NASTY!"}
{"text":"The Foundation Room is located at the Mandalay Bay. It's a very classy elegant restaurant with tasteful dishes. I have to say one of the best restaurants I have ever dined at. Enough said."}
{"text":"Gorgeous sight of the strip on their rooftop, good music in both rooms and great vibe. Only downfall is the patio is too tight & small for the crowd so either go early or book a VIP couch section to be able to enjoy it.  We went for my daughter's birthday this past weekend and were on the guest list. It was an easy access to get, you do have to go through a quick security check, then in the elevator to the top. Once inside the fun begins.....I would recommend this place and would go back when in town."}
{"text":"Amazing view, nice place to see a show. I was blown away by the view as you can see the entire Vegas Valley from atop Mandalay Bay. We were there for the Jake Owens show and I was impressed with how close we were to the artist. Its like having top musicians come to your house and play in your living room. I can't wait until the next event I am fortunate enough to be invited to here."}
{"text":"This place is only receiving two stars for the view and service.  First off if you don't know where Fountain Room is good luck trying to find it while you're in the casino. Ok I'll just tell you, if you are by hotel registration it is right behind you. There will be a host stand that will send you up the restaurant.   We went to dinner a bit late. Reservation was at 8:30pm. There were two other tables seated so place was not busy at all. Service staff was great and attentive.   Food on the other hand was a different story. We started off with crab cakes and they tasted like they were frozen and thawed out then frozen again and fried. Definitely had a store bought feel to them. Was not tasty whatsoever.   Then our salad followed. Typical Caesar salad, not special but highly over priced. Only thing good about this was I asked for a side of anchovies and those looked extremely fresh. Still had a good silver color on them.   Next was entree. We ordered braised short ribs and truffled mac n cheese. Usually short ribs fall off the bone and this one did not. Was still soft but not the melt in your mouth type. Still had to put some effort into cutting the meat which is not good. Also there was not too much flavor to the dish. The truffled mac n cheese tasted like they blow the air from the truffles onto the mac n cheese. Top layer had the smell of truffles but once you got past that it was nothing but a simple bowl of mac n cheese, definitely not worth the price.  Last we had the pear tart for dessert. Dessert came out cold and didn't have the sweet and savory taste it should have.   Our overall experience with the food was not great hence the 2 stars. Would recommend coming here for some drinks and the view."}
{"text":"Impressive views of Las Vegas but surly staff.   The Foundation Room seems to have been the rage during an earlier era, or perhaps caters to a crowd that is comfortable in darker alleys. Our group of computer programmers, who were at the Mandalay for a week long IBM conference, felt bullied by the bouncers, but what left a more lasting impression was when we were all pushed back inside from the balcony (the only reason to visit The Foundation Room in the first place) by the waitstaff. The quote, and I can't make this up, was: \"We're closing this down because we're not making enough money off of you.\"  At least they were honest.    Three stars for the view."}
{"text":"Arrived, it was 14 minutes before we were approached.  We ordered a bottle of wine that took 12 minutes. Then we asked for appetizers that was another 20 minutes. We were out of wine and not a server in site.  Appetizers arrived, everything was cold. Not a server around. We were taking clients out that are worth more then three million.  Dinner was ordered.. my Ribeye ordered Med rare was well done, Ny strip Med rare was so tough. My next steak came back well done, chewy and so tough, couldn't eat it.  Poor service, poor food quality, poor everything. Would never recommend this restaurant. GM @ restaurant in Chicago. This restaurant failed miserably."}
{"text":"This is the place. This is the place everyone wants to get in on Saturday nights (the only night non-members can get in) and there is a reason! The view is one of the best on the strip and the decor made up of price-less antiques from india. The crowd is rowdy and eager to get partying after waiting in line forever. This is the place to wear your nicest clothes, spend all your money, and dance to the best music. If you have ever been to Las vegas and haven't been here then you are truly missing out. Not everyone knows about htis place but for those in the know, there isn't anywhere else on Mondays."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Good option to consider if you don't want to go to a night club or just sit in the Casino for the night out. Its a roof top bar & lounge definitely different atmosphere but the view is AMAZING. The first time I visited here years ago I was approached by Roy. He is the best! So friendly & helpful! They were pretty busy that night but he was quick to assure us that he would take care of my group of girls & guys. With some patience we were up there in no time. We had so much fun, variety of music; hip-hop, house, top 25. The venue is a bit dark but the staff were more than happy to help. In the day they do open the restaurant area. The food is yummy! I've had the burgers, fried-cauliflower and more. Such a fun place to spend the night definitely should check it out."}
{"text":"Ugh so disappointing; especially since I had such a great time last time.  Couple of things 1) If \"locals\" are free, why did my friends who are local have to pay? 2) When did it become socially acceptable for ppl to see a girl get finger banged in her butt?   I know #2 intrigues most of you so let me explain. There were these 2 \"girls\" (should be more like whores but whatever)  who were sitting next to the door all over themselves. BTW a guy was there too. So OK they're making out whatever, but when you start seeing one of the girls spread eagle and start getting fingered in the butt, that's just nasty. I don't care how horny you are, you do not, I repeat, do not need to get fingered in the butt in public. That grossed a lot of ppl out, obviously. Made me and the group leave the bar for a while.  The other big reason why I now think this place suck is the management. The guy who let us in the last time is now a huge d*ck.  A group of us were trying to go to another room only to have one of the huge wooden door slam into my friends face. Of course my friend tried to protect herself by putting her hand out but the manager said she was shoving the door open? WTF?!   We weren't even there for 1 hr. None of us were drunk but got kicked out for \"slamming the door\".   Would I go back here again? I don't think so."}
{"text":"We went for the first time with a group of ten, the group left after a very long dinner agreeing it may have been the worst place we had ever eaten at! We had not had any of the food we ordered for 2 hours and 10 minutes! No I am not kidding, in fact the service was so bad we had to leave the table and go down a floor to a cash bar just to get a drink! Avoid this place at all cost!"}
{"text":"Location location location.   It might be safe to say that the foundation room has the best view of the strip in Vegas. I'm a view person, I love a good sight to see, so this weighs heavily with me and it's why I keep going back.   They play decent music, and it's more of a lounge feel than a club. They also have bottle service and tables outside overlooking the strip which is definitely the way to do it.   Inside is a little dingy and dated, but that's like he whole point so it's fine.   Really, I don't pay attention to anything but the view."}
{"text":"This may be my favorite lounge in the Vegas strip.  Unsuspecting in Mandalay Bay.. it's got a few things I like:  - Free drinks for the ladies.. whoop whoop!  It was two free drink tickets. - AMAZING view of the strip.  There are heat lamps and that alone is awesome. - Smaller in size so it's not like the typical Vegas clubs.  It's for the more sophisticated. - Moving dancers.. so they don't just stand there all night like they do in clubs - Amazing unique décor.. love!  I will be visiting again next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here April 2010.  It was expensive to get up there, but well worth it.  It was full, but not crowded.  The place has 2 DJs and both were playing good music to dance too.  There's a view that is absolutely amazing, down the strip.    It was easy to dance and then to lounge, plenty of seating.  I had a great time and partied it up."}
{"text":"The view was awesome, but other than that...meh. Cool atmosphere, but much smaller than I expected! The DJ was decent, drinks were good, but Vegas-priced. I was glad we didn't pay a cover. My friend and I didn't really want to go to a club, so this was fine for us."}
{"text":"Come here if you like incense and a pretentious crowd (hey, sometimes I do!).    I wasn't impressed by the FR lounge for a few reasons.  1. Slowness. It took about 30 minutes before a server asked what we'd like to drink.  And the saddest part is that this was before rush hour! Every other drink order came 20 minutes too late.  2. I was trying to nibble off of my salad on the very edge of the \"coffee\" table because it was full of other massively-sized plates - no room left for anything else. My pricy salad became a floor accessory.  The server so kindly took my plate away but offered nothing in return - no redo, no discounted new salad.  3. We had two members at our table, and in the later night we ended up in a reserved space where we were pretty much secluded in the worst way possible: No service again.  The reason, they claimed: The reserved space is for bottle service only.  $500 bottle of wine is normal in LV, I get it. But on this fine night, not one of the 6 people in our group wanted wine.  But, in order to get anything else, we had to walk out of the reserved space, go down stairs, go to the bar, and order ourselves.  The view here is great, as are the desserts...but this is Vegas. Competition is fierce!  Odds are you'll find a better spot elsewhere."}
{"text":"Vegas is a town were everything seems FAKE..   This is what makes the House of Blues Foundation Room even more awesome! The vibe in the Foundation Room is that of a chill VIP lounge. Dark and classy room where you are surrounded by stunning artifacts from around the world.  HoB Foundation Room is my favorite stop while in Vegas. When you check in, ask for Steve and tell him Philip Nelson sent you! :)"}
{"text":"I have been to the foundation room I would say about a half dozen times it is either hit or miss I usually have a really terrible time or a really good time which equals a hit or miss I do not like it for one reason only the fact that you seem to have to be special downstairs by the elevator but then when they let you go upstairs you notice that it's a bunch of tourists so I'm not exactly sure where that whole psyche is It's got great Decour and of course drinking outside at the top of the Mandalay Bay and taking photos with the best of Las Vegas is amazing but it is not as exclusive as it used to be"}
{"text":"How is it  I have not reviewed this place? I have been here a few times now and each time is pretty awesome. Last night did not disappoint. I was there for something the Weekly was doing and it was free appetizers and drinks. Love that so much!! The drinks were being poured hella strong. I almost could not choke down mine it was so loaded! This is by far one of my favorite night spots on the strip. It is not that loud & they dont play a bunch of horrible hip hop. I guess I am getting older and enjoy a more mild club when I go out. Its so nice to hang out on the balcony and check out Vegas in all its glittery perfection."}
{"text":"I don't know what they do to their asparagus, but I wish I could take a couple hundred pounds of it home.    The truffle Mac-n-cheese....devine! My  husband and I  took the leftover Mac-n-chesse  back to our room at the Mandalay  and fought over who should get it later that night.    The bread basket..soooo good.  Oh yeah they serve entrees too...some of the best steaks my husband and I ever tasted.  The service was exceptional. Be sure to spend some time on the bar patio, the view is great."}
{"text":"Great view of the city with dark, loungy atmosphere. Perhaps because we were there on a weeknight it was dead...music was sleep inducing, nothing spectacular on the menu, staff inattentive.....this is an exclusive lounge from what I was told, but nothing about it gave me that impression at all."}
{"text":"WOW!  Not sure, but I don't consider this a dance club (except maybe Monday nights).  I love the Foundation Room for a number of reasons.    First, it is very \"un-Vegas\".  It is a great place to take clients, and is exclusive.  A lot of business gets done there.    Second, it is typically quiet.  When in town and not entertaining, I like to go to watch a game and have a great appetizer and drink in the video room.   Third, dinner is 5 stars.  Not an inexpensive dinner mind you, but very memorable.    Yes, people get in on the \"list\" or \"comped\" up from the hotel/casino and act poorly.  But the membership is typically much better behaved.  Mondays are the example of nights to miss, unless you want to mingle with that ..."}
{"text":"Great view, good tunes, would be a great place if the bouncers weren't such assholes and super rude. Paid for bottle service (which isn't cheap). The least you would THINK you would get is common decency. Wouldn't go back based on the crappy treatment and utter lack of respect demonstrated by the 'bouncers'. Click"}
{"text":"Una gran vista, muy buen ambiente en cuanto a música y la decoración del lugar, y por supuesto una vista privilegiada de las Vegas!"}
{"text":"\"Antithesis\"-A Review of Foundation Room, Las Vegas, Nevada  One night while recording my GoPro pilot television show, I utilized the word \"antithesis\" properly while still piss drunk.  My ability to manipulate the English language, while inebriated baffles me.  Nevertheless, a literary antithesis emphasizes elaboration through the contrast of opposites by parallel structures of the contrasted phrases.  Usually below the surface of ground, the lowest part of a building, wall, or other structure can be defined as a foundation.  However, when it comes to Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, Nevada, located on the sixty-fourth floor, the Foundation Room is the antithesis of foundation.    Exiting the elevator, the Foundation Room nightclub experience transforms into a surreal, almost heavenly atmosphere.  Unfortunately, my iPhone6s broke from jumping into the pool at Wet Republic, so I do not have any photographs.  But if I recall correctly, the décor infused Asian Indian culture while advertising hues of amber and magenta, which mirrored the Mandalay Bay reflective ambiance.  The lighting and music volumes were both perfect, neither too loud nor too soft.  Likewise, the bathrooms were spot on point for a nightclub.  Most importantly, good-looking attentive, and competent bartending staff quickly mixed our drinks immediately.    Up until this point, I thought the Foundation Room was a pretty good nightclub, and then the dancers came out.  They were fantastic.  Typical of any Vegas club, they were better looking and better dancers what I saw in Chicago during the winter of 2015 at Shay and Underground.  Slowly but surely, my first impressions of Foundation Room were becoming better and better.  Then I travelled outside and my breath was literally swept away.   Being born and raised in the Chicago land area, I would like to say the view from the sixty-fourth floor rivals that of the John Hancock Signature Room on the ninety-fifth floor in Chicago, Illinois.  However, you are outside with the wind blowing in your face and it is VEGAS baby!  The view from the Foundation Room at Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas, Nevada is the best place to drink on the planet.  In fact, I told Hot Blonde Chick #2, \"You see this town?  One day it will be ours!\"    Then some crazy British chick came by and attempted to ruin our moment.  She said something about Americans being overly capitalistic and money driven or something.  It was VEGAS.  With her slutty outfit, she was obviously throwing her boobs into my face.  Therefore, I eloquently informed her, \"The top button on your blouse is undone.\"    You will never believe what she did!  She completely ripped her blouse open, exposing her bra and bare chest.  Realizing her embarrassment, she punched me in the face.  Then her friends escorted her away.  My girlfriend and I laughed before returning to our own world, discussing our plans.  LOOK, if you're looking for a place with thousands of people crammed into an obscure tinny space with loud over bearing music, then Foundation Room is not the place for you.    However, if you are in search of a great place to chill and gaze out over the beautiful city of Las Vegas, with the window blowing in your hair...  If you are in search of an awesome place to grab a table and a bottle of champagne...  If you are in search of a Cosmo and some dancing with plenty of room, then Foundation Room is the Las Vegas nightclub right for you.  Hell, I would rebook Mandalay Bay, just for the pools and Foundation Room.  This is coming from an Aria and MGM whore.  Anyway, at some point that weekend, some fat bald old guy complained about not being able to get into Foundation Room.  Now, I don't know if this was true; however, at Foundation Room, Hot Blonde Chick #2 and I were recruited to enter.  At Foundation Room, we were given free entry due to our astonishingly good-looks.  At Foundation Room, we were given free drink tickets.  For a late twenty and early thirty year old Vegas voyager, that is amazing service.  That is why with all the clubs in Vegas we returned time and time again during our six-day stay.  If you find my review biased because of this fact, then that is your opinion.  However, clubs want good-looking people because it is good business.    If you are a fat bald old guy, then you should probably workout, not go clubbing, or have money.  The fat bald old guy is the antithesis of the owners' desired patronage demographics, the foundation of their service.   If you are the antithesis of the foundation, then there is room for improvement.  For the last year, whether it has been Virginia Beach, Columbus, Cincinnati, Chicago, or Las Vegas, Foundation Room is Brdman and Hot Blonde Chick favorite nightclub."}
{"text":"Pretty space with a nice view of the strip. I like the Asian themed decor, and the intimacy of the lounge.  Why only three stars? I've been here twice (the first time on a Friday night), but this review is for the last visit on a Sunday night.  The bouncers insisted on charging my boyfriend for entry, although we were staying in the hotel. Okay...that's fine if it's a busy night, but when it's nearly empty, I don't appreciate it. If I wanted to pay for a real club, I'd go to one.  Then we had to deal with the bitchy female bartender. She ignored me for a good five minutes, despite the lack of customers. She was too busy talking to her male friend at the end of the bar. She made my boyfriend's martini completely wrong, and took her sweet time doing it. Thanks for the hospitality.  Then we went outside to sit on the balcony, and it was full of dirty glasses and cocktail napkins on the floor. Only one heat lamp was working, and other patrons were freezing and complaining.  The hip hop from the 90's they were spinning got boring fast, so we left. Maybe it was just their B team on staff that night, but that is not the type of experience I go to Vegas for."}
{"text":"Its the BEST place to act like an ass and buy drinks for C-List celebrities, NBA players and cool peeps that are stoked and wanna party after you collect your winnings from the sports book.   So the crew bets big on Oscar to lose and wins huge when he does, and takes the $$$ to the best view probably in all of Vegas. The drinks weren't that expensive, The music was cool party music that's ignorable and danceable all at the same time.   Best time ever on a Vegas Saturday night or it could just be the euphoria of winning talking.... nah this place is rad."}
{"text":"Went here for my mom's 50th b-day. We were joined by a total of 15 other people who are family. Let's just say that there were many complaints on the amount of food given for the price we paid. Not a great place for a large crowd but very doable for a couple's date. Also, the service was not great being that it is a 5 star restaurant. I guess you could say that I simply expected more for the price we paid. I honestly could have gotten a better steak @ Outback for 1/2 the price and larger quantity.   I'm giving it 3 stars for it's great decor and ambiance (TAO-like w/ Asian inspired decor & dim lighting).  A FANTASTIC VIEW OF THE STRIP!!!"}
{"text":"I got such a good experience for dinner at this place. The place is well-decorative with service for fine dining on high top of Mandalay Bay hotel. It wasn't crowded for Friday night at 9pm at the restaurant but the bar area was already packed. I love the view but it would be better if my fish plate wasn't too salted. The steak was delicious."}
{"text":"Being bias maybe because I had such a great time here. Now these rooms are a little pricey along with the food. However the atmosphere is epic. Great music and amazing rooftop view"}
{"text":"The architecture was great though the crowd wasn't so much for me.  Definitely older dull types.  I guess that's what you get with a members only place.  The view is absolutely amazing though, definitely the best view in Vegas.  The drinks aren't over priced, it's a good place for a date or to entertain someone but not a place to get down at.  From what I've been told the food is amazing but we were only there for drinks.  I'd go back.. on a different note though, good place though."}
{"text":"It's all about the view!  The music was a good mesh of new and fav's. The cozy atmosphere made you feel like you weren't missing anything on the strip. I spent most of my evening on the balcony staring out at the city lights and the most amazing view of the strip. I was there on the weekend, cannot comment on the weekdays."}
{"text":"Skip the foundation room.  Talk to you like they put their pants on different than you!  Lol. They seem to have forgetton!  WE PAY YOUR WAGES!   Come to Vic & Anthony's.  Treated with respect and appreciate the conversation.   This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff and hospitality! The menu continues to improve. Very generous and enjoyable drinks."}
{"text":"My review is mainly for the restaurant. I've eaten here a couple of times and the food is SOOOO GOOD!  Both times, everything we ordered was on point.    We came here last night for restaurant week. For $50 you get a 3-course meal.  I chose the crab cakes for my appetizer, the 6 oz. filet for my entree, and the molten lava chocolate cake for my dessert.    The crab cakes were two per serving and they were pretty big. They didn't have too much breading and had a slight crisp on the outside with large chunks of crab on the inside. They came with a slaw that complimented the crab cakes perfectly.  The steak came with a gorgonzola cream sauce. My mouth is watering just thinking about the steak with that cream sauce. The steak was perfectly cooked to how I ordered it and it tasted so amazing with the sauce. The seasoning was just right as well. Other than Joe's Stone Crab, this is one of the best filets I've ever had.    The molten chocolate cake was good. It didn't blow me away but maybe that's because I was stuffed by then.    The other time I was here we also ordered the mac and cheese and again, one of my FAVORITE mac n cheese's at fancy restaurant ever.  I crave this meal!  In addition, our service was excellent. Our server Danny was very attentive and super nice. My dirty martini was originally made incorrectly and he was so gracious about getting it fixed. Within minutes I had a new one and it was perfect. He even personally stuffed the olives with blue cheese for me."}
{"text":"Oooh, it's so exclusive.  Ooh, it's so expensive.  NOT!    Went there last weekend with my best friend and guess what, it was neither hard to get a reservation nor was it that incredibly expensive.  I was in the room all day in the morning for the shooting of a show, and this guy there kept telling us how exclusive this place was, members only, and pointing out that celebrities have their own cubby by the entrance with the the type of alcohol they like to drink.  I called, made reservations, I was exclusive too.  When I called I did get asked if I was a member, I said no.  The girl asked \"how did you hear about us?\" and I said someone told me about it.  That was it.    They do have a dress code for dinner, no tennis shoes, no hats.  Business casual they called it.  However, you can wear jeans.  At the bottom, there were like 3 bouncers, all who melted into puppies when I told them I had a reservation.  The service was GREAT, and they appreciated a little humor.  The food was fantastic.  I had some sort of seafood dish which was spectacular.  My friend ordered the lamb, which she couldn't finish, so we took a medallion home.  I ate it cold hours later, and it was still fantastic!  The views are, of course, spectacular.  You can see the entire strip.  However, I was taking pics with the Canon EOS 7D and one of the bouncer guys said \"I'm sorry, you can't use that camera up here, it's too powerful\".  Uh...what?  No clue what that was about, but apparently you should just bring one of those little point and shoot cameras that every drunk girl in Vegas has.  Come before sunset, watch the city glimmer at night, then stay for a drink in their uber sexy chic trendy lounges, which I didn't have time to do.  Would love to do it again."}
{"text":"Ever wonder what it would be like to party with the Golden Girls?   I recently had some drinks with a few friends at the Foundation Room in Las Vegas. Not that we were on the prowl, but the average woman in this establishment was 55yrs old.   NEWS FLASH: Desperate housewives was fake! Perhaps this was their target audience? I don't know. If it was, mission accomplished!   On the flip side, the place is a trip. I totally dug the layout and style. The vintage interior, high view patio, and velvet walls made the place look like Hugh Hefner's living room. The dim lights and carpeted lounges added to the \"Playboy 1979\" ambiance.   If someone could teach the doorman how to say \"No,\" they could really turn this place into something special."}
{"text":"You definitely come here for the view. I came a couple times. First time was for a company get together and tried their appetizers and drinks. Loved both! They have some amazing cultural art pieces throughout the place. The second time was dinner with my husband. I thought the dinner was ok. My husband had the steak and I had the scallops. Like I said, you come for the view. The food didn't disappoint but I've had better steak and scallops. It's definitely still worth it to dine here and walk over to the bar area and chill and relax in the balcony to enjoy the view."}
{"text":"Saturday night - After dining upstairs in the House of Blues Foundation Room, the BF and I wandered through this elusive lounge to check out the scene and to enjoy the view.    Yes, the view is absolutely fabulous.  With the Mandalay Bay Hotel being at the south end of the strip, it gives you a fabulous view looking up the strip.  And yes, we took a picture up there too.  With a view like that, who doesn't? While enjoying the view, you also meet the most interesting of people who are happy to invite you to party with them, and I do mean 'party' in all ways Vegas can be interpreted.  The music was okay, and the crowd was interesting.  There was a variety of people, in terms of age and genre.  I can't say the same about the ethnic card though as there wasn't such a diversity at all.  We checked out some of the smaller rooms and danced a bit.  I wasn't too impressed by the cow who tripped over her drunk self while apparently trying to dance sexy and in the process stuck her heel into my foot. (And of course, I was wearing open-toed shoes.)  It wouldn't have been so bad if she apologized or excused herself, but she was so drunk and embarrassing that the guys around her were having a 'good' time with her.  Odds were they were both trying to figure out who gets to take her home 'cuz you know she was going to go home with someone, it was just a matter of who.  (If I were them, they both should have negotiated and both gone with her!)    The ladies' room gets crowded as everyone is in there fixing their make-up and you're bound to find someone, anyone kicking back with the restroom attendant.  I wasn't sure if it was a guest or a cocktail waitress, either way, she was just sitting in there chatting it up all night long.   It's not that crowded on a Saturday night because you do need to be on the list or a member.  Monday nights are crazy because that's when they open up the doors to the public.  I would only return for the view, but that's about it.  Better music and atmosphere can be found elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was only in this place for about 2 minutes. I went on the patio, I believe this place has the best view of the strip in Vegas. Outside of that the place was extremely small. I thought we were in someone's living room. I can't even remember what kind of music they were playing."}
{"text":"Fantastic strip view, excellent cocktail waitresses, beautiful crowd."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic!   Kudos to chef.  Bar was great.   Brian rocked as a bartender.   When we sat for dinner it went downhill.   Server Todd put the app in front of empty seat instead of middle it table.   Hardly  checked in us.   Left empty plates in front of us.  And face us check before offering desserts.   It was my gfs big birthday so of course we wanted desserts.   But don't worry, we won't be back.  Too many other restaurants that will cater to us for a $400 dinner.   Thanks...no thanks."}
{"text":"We were told that the Foundation Room was the place to go on Monday nights.  However, the night didn't start off too well since we had to wait in line (which I don't like doing) haha.  After we got in, we walked around and went outside to check out the view.  I wish it wasn't so cold outside, I would have stayed out there longer.  The view was amazing.  (check out my pictures)    We went back inside and had a blast drinking and dancing.  There were a lot of friendly people there which made it nice as well.  I definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"The Foundation Room is a sort of hidden treasure. The entrance is very small and there is an elevator that takes you to the top of Mandalay Bay which literally took a minute to reach.  Walking into Foundation, it was almost reminiscent of Disneyland's haunted mansion with a hint of elegance and class. It has 2 separate rooms, one with a bar and more of a bigger lounge area and another private room, while the other had more of a living room feel to it. There was even a fireplace. The furniture is very regal and lush and there are candles lit to complete the serene ambiance. The dj that night played good music pleasing to the ears and soul. It was nice not to hear the usual \"to the window, to the wall!\" type of music.   The best part was the amazing view. The balcony overlooks the entire strip so get those cameras ready if you love taking skyline view pictures! The balcony also has couches and standing tables to bask in all it's glory.   This is a good place to check out, if you like the social, let's talk and have drinks kind of scene. I went for a Project party, so my friends and I got in free. I read that this place is very exclusive and \"very VIP\" which in Vegas means you need connections to get in. I've also read that the cover charge is $30, so if you want to shell out money and have a classy time, I suggest you check this place out."}
{"text":"I have been to this lounge a couple of times this past year. Once to see a live dub-step show and once again to hang with family and friends.  Upon entering after the elevator ride up you walk through dimly lit halls to get to each room of the floor. It's decorated beautifully in rich wood and classy dark structures. There definitely is great ambiance.   The best part I must say along with other critics is the view! It is an absolutely stunning view of the city. Great place to relax and have a drink. We had free drink coupons, but obviously the drinks aren't the best deals you'd get in town.   The vibe was totally different when I had came here for the dub-step show. Obviously there was a different crowd and the room was a bit small to be having such loud bass playing all night. Other than that, the couches are luscious and the workers I had come across weren't all that bad, but could be a little friendlier in my opinion.   Overall, great lounge to check out."}
{"text":"I attended the Vegas Seven, Best of the City private party last night at the Foundation room.  Great party, thankful for the evening.  I don't quite understand the theme inside.  Tapestry, incense, just kind of weird to me, because you go outside on the balcony and it looks like an outdoor ultra lounge.  Not too cohesive in my opinion.  The view was out of this world, though.  Amazing.  For the party, it was great.  The Foundation room offered a full bar and a few signature cocktails for the evening.  I got the Peach and Elderflower Collins the entire night.  Bombay Sapphire, juice of a half a lemon, St. Germain and peach puree.  It was delicious and trust me, I'm NOT a gin drinker.  This drink was amazing.  Tangy, sweet and not heavy with gin, so I tasted nothing!  It was good, but beware, it's a creeper.  I got drunk!!!  For the food, they served fried chicken lollipops, bite size shrimp and grits, lamb tacos, a dessert table and a pizza table with meats and cheese. All the food was on point, not heavy and super flavorful.    Pretty cool night.  I appreciate the invite, Vegas Seven.  Great hosts.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"The Foundation Room?  What is this enigmatic place??  The question shouldn't be what is this place rather, why haven't I Yelped about this place earlier.  Radiant in character in a dim, intimate setting is how I can best describe the Foundation Room.  This mystical lounge is perched high atop the Mandalay Bay hotel.    There's more to the Mandalay Bay than Rum Jungle (gag!) you ask?   Yes, there is and it's called the Foundation Room.  And once you've experienced it you'll find yourself setting the bar high for any other lounge in comparison.  We love taking our out of town guests here to experience all that is mysterious and exotic about the seven secluded rooms and main lounge area.  The carpeted interior make it easy on the feet when you want to get up and dance, the plush furniture will make you feel like you are truly somewhere exclusive and the alluring decor will have you forget you are in Vegas and feel as if you're in some other worldy place.  VIP service here is nothing short than exemplary and so is the music.  See Dimitri, he is the most outstanding head host in all of Vegas."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars with an amazing view, and amazing drinks! It's so interesting that this place sits on top of a hotel building and overlooks the whole Las Vegas strip. I have yet to come here for dinner but I absolutely love this place! It has a stylish Moroccan type of theme with couches and a lounge type feel. Then, there is this outside part with tons of seating that overlooks everything. The drinks are pricey but are so worth it! They taste amazing, and you definitely get a bang for your buck"}
{"text":"One of the best views in the City if not The Best. Definitely a bit smaller and more of a lounge but the second bar and Dj on the balcony gives you a place to breathe and enjoy the view."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Las Vegas. Here are a few reasons: 1. Spectacular view of the strip 2. Great atmosphere 3. More mature crowd... No fist pumping here. 4. Love the people that work here, a great staff! Especially the security team. 5. The outdoor patio... I could stand out there all night just taking in the city view 6. Solid sound system and great resident DJs like DJ GIRL 6. 7. A fun spot to bring Vegas newbies All in all this is a great place to start, finish, or continue your night. I have not had dinner here yet but I hear it's delicious. You will find me here often so don't be afraid to come buy me a drink :-)"}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with The Foundation Rooms bar/lounge area. We were staying at the Mandalay bay for the weekend & were looking for a place that had a UFC 196 viewing party. They offered $25 general admission for the standing room or $200 to spend on food & drinks for up to four guest at a table. Solid deal considering you'll be there 3-4 hours & $200 to split four ways is nothing.  Initially we were annoyed because the doors were suppose to open at 6 but there was an issue with some of the host being late that escort people up the elevator to the 64th floor so things were delayed half an hour. While waiting in line we talked to some people that have been there before & they assured us that the food will make up for the little delay we were all going through.  On the lounge side serve a limited section of the menu, it may seems a little pricy but it was worth every penny & I'm not the \"foodie\" type of person that typically defends expensive food just because it taste good. I think we went through five or six of the Yellow Tail plates, & two steak & chicken skewers. They made some pretty good drinks & the view on the outside patio is amazing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got the opportunity to spend NYE at the Foundation for 2014 and it was the best New Years celebration yet! They have a spectacular view of the strip, probably the best in the city and all of the rooms are special and unique with a taste of Tao design. The entire staff was very kind and accommodating, it felt as if you were a guest in someones home, very cozy and elegant! I would highly recommend anyone who lives or visits Vegas to check out the Foundation Room, you will be very happy you did!"}
{"text":"Great view, but doorman at the elevator was a complete d---, and the bartenders were too involved in talking with each other to care about asking if we wanted a drink, no wonder this place was so empty!  We received passes from a club promoter standing around MB, who told us it was also 2 for 1 drinks, we get up there and that deal ended at 10pm (false advertising), but before we even got up there the guy at the elevator, which takes you up to the FR was so rude and uninviting.  We got a beer ($7), after standing at the empty bar for 5 mins and being ignored completely by staff and stood out on the balcony with the 5 other people in the place and then decided to try out a different spot.  When we went back downstairs we thought that maybe they would get better as the night went on and also hoped the music would change by then (they advertised hip hop and were playing house/pop), so we asked the doorman if we could come back up later on if we decided to, his mumbled and rude response \"yeah, if we're open\" ok...well what time do you close? \"probably 30 mins, I don't know\" avoiding eye contact the entire time.  During this exchange, about 5 girls trying to go up decided not to when he said \"30 mins\" - wow what a horrible promoter! FR could be an awesome spot with some better music and some decent staff!"}
{"text":"Another one of our regular hang spots! ABSOLUTE best views in Vegas for sure! Good drinks, staff is cool and people are friendly.   Once around 11pm rolls around, the music gets cranked and people start up the dancing! We always have a blast here!"}
{"text":"This was our 3rd year in a row to celebrate my birthday! It's worth it to get a table and bottle service. You get your own private security who escorts you on or off the dance floor. Steve our security guy was awesome!! He was always available to make sure we were ok! Best club for an older crowd. You don't have to worry about young, barely 21 years old throwing up on you here. The view is spectacular! Highly recommend for a night of fun. DJ plays great music. Can't wait to come next year!"}
{"text":"This place is such a breath of fresh air from other lounges. While it is not a private members club much anymore, the staff still has that training and quality. Each time I've visited I've been shown nothing but respect and class (which is rare in Vegas for a mid 20's male). The drinks are well priced, the music is fun, and the crowd is usually great. Oh- and let's not forget about that magical view."}
{"text":"Gorgeous view, warm and intimate decor, and a great crowd.  Everyone I accidentally bumped into (it was packed!) was kind and seemingly in great spirits, no evil looks or crowds of women giving other crowds of women the evil eye (as is commonplace in most clubs).  Not sure what non-member-only nights are like, but Friday nights are crackin!"}
{"text":"This is the place you take that girl who has never gotten to experience that picturesque view of the strip.  Its jaw-dropping.  The décor and the ambience is that of a mahogany encrusted dojo meshed with Hugh Heffner's bedroom.  Unique, colorful, intimate.  The food is good and the drinks are strong.  Although the experience is factored into the price.    Definitely check it out at least once if you've never been.  Take that cute girl with ya...  ;)"}
{"text":"Such a great place to come and hang. We had a blast here.  The service was top notch, the food was great and we had a view of the whole Vegas Strip from the balcony of the Foundation Room."}
{"text":"Oohh... ahhh... a posh, semi-secret members-only club in Vegas!  You know what?  It's not nearly as cool as it sounds.  Imagine my disappointment, after getting onto the VIP list with the help of a local connection, but it's the truth.  (The Foundation Room is open to the hoi polloi on Mondays, or else there wouldn't be much point in reviewing it, would there?)  Okay, yes, it does feel pretty awesome when you walk up to the unobtrusive podium in the lobby, murmur your name to the hostess behind the desk, and get waved through the ropes to the single elevator.  There's no need to punch buttons, because it only goes one place - straight up to the Foundation (ironically, located at almost the very top of Mandalay Bay).    When the elevator doors open, you're greeted with the kind of quiet, plush elegance that tells you you really don't belong.  The club consists of a series of rooms branching off to either side of a main lounge.  From the lounge, you can also reach the restaurant and the balcony, which really does have a stunning view of the Strip - the best in the city, if the hype is to be believed.  It's pretty spectacular, and so the balcony is always crowded with people wrestling between their desire to gawk and their desire to look cool and jaded.  And yes, the decor is not only tasteful but actually beautiful - romantically dim lights, opulent Indian and Asian art and decorations, and exotic wood paneling and carvings.  Smaller, private rooms off the hallways are reserved for private parties, but a quick peek revealed low, plush couches and more elaborate furnishings and art.    The main lounge is where the bar is, but good luck muscling your way up to the front and getting served - and if you do, you'll find yourself paying $12 for a small drink that's mostly ice.  Yum.  A second, smaller room has another bar and (at least the night I was there) a complimentary hookah table set up on one side, with three hookahs bubbling away in different flavors.  Bowls of plastic-wrapped disposable mouthpieces were set out, so you'd just grab one and get ready to puff - an uncharacteristically free bonus in an otherwise insanely overpriced place.  The music wasn't anything super-special - muted trance-house with a vaguely Asian flavor in the lounge, and more hip-hop in the smaller room.  But everyone is too busy looking hott and being way too cool to actually want to dance, so all there really is to do here is silently judge each other's outfits and suck on your expensive ice drink.  This is okay for about an hour, but then it gets old fast.  I'm glad I went to the Foundation Room for two reasons: to see that magnificent view, and to have my illusions about exclusive members-only clubs demolished.  Yeah, it's posh and people are probably wearing outfits that cost more than my annual salary, but you'll have way more fun slurping $2 beaker shots and dancing to disco at Gay Corners, where everyone's allowed in.  Power to the people!"}
{"text":"I am not sure why it smells like incense. I am not sure why it is covered in tapestry. But, the vibe works, and I like a place that is committed to a motif. It's plush; it's cozy, and it provides one of the best views in Vegas. It is perhaps one of the truest lounges on the Strip. However, the music is generally nothing inspiring, and the drinks are pretty typical. Even so, I always have good times here, as there is enough room for a little impromptu dancing from time to time, and entry is often free."}
{"text":"Foundation Room memberships and proceeds  support the International House of Blues Foundation, a charity dedicated to promoting cultural understanding and creative expression through music and art. Have fun and give back, sweet deal!  The staff is top-notch, the food is amazing and the drinks are divine. And the view is awesome - GO!"}
{"text":"Amazing view of the strip. Go around dusk for killer pics!  If in bar area this turns into a club about 10.   No bags allowed.   If there for food good selection and the dinning room has great views, ask for window seat.  Atmosphere pretty loud. You can hear other tables chatter. Our service was slow. Dinged for a star."}
{"text":"Excellent view from the top of Mandalay Bay. The live music,beautiful waitresses and food is great. The private rooms are awesome for that professional feel."}
{"text":"Don't go to this place unless you want to be harassed or assaulted by the security. I literally saw this tall Samoan security guy scream at a groom who had a party there, \"I will fuck you up\" then proceed to choke him out and punch him after this short security girl screamed at him for going to the wrong exit when he was trying to leave.   Her and the Samoan security guy took him to an empty room and they choked him and punched him until people got angry and told them to stop. They didn't even want to kick him out, they wanted to keep him there.  Later on, the Samoan security said \"Fuck that guy, no one talks to my girl like that, he got lucky he's walking\"   It could be a good place if you didn't feel like the security team is a gang."}
{"text":"This is for the terrible $250. (just a couple beers) dinner for 2. The food was not good! So sad, the view and staff were great. Start to finish, keeps getting worse. The crab cakes didn't have much flavor and had a mustard sauce that was okay. The foundation salad was boring giant leaves with hardly any dressing. The terrible part was the expensive steaks! We were talked into ordering them oscar style. That was not crab! We were both nauseated by the flavor! Never had anything that bad. Didn't make us sick, but couldn't wait to leave and get that taste out of our mouths. We kept waiting for something good but the meal just kept getting worse. My new york was dry, no flavor at all and had a huge (grissel) threw it that my steak knife wouldn't cut! I can't remember the last time I saw that running threw my steak. I wonder if we ordered the steaks as they are on the menu if it would have been any better. I called and some girl said she would tell the chef. Gee thanks! I thought they might at least offer to try again, I don't know if I could do it. If you can get to the bar have a drink, the place is very classy and the view is great. Please don't pay for the food. I have had amazing meals in Vegas. I'm really sad I waisted my meal and money on this!"}
{"text":"I got lost and stepped into an opulent room in a grand Thai castle. That must be it! How else would I be able to explain this beautifully decorated Thai-themed lounge with plushed carpets and Buddhist statues everywhere? There was a convention in town and most of the club-goers were older men and women. It is wonderful to be able to shake my booty on the dance floor without annoying young teenage-looking boys approaching me from all directions.  This is a really really nice place to chill and have a drink with your friends. You can enjoy the amazing view out on the balcony while sipping on a diet coke (fail, I know. Who drinks a diet coke when they're at a club?!), or dance, or just to have a conversation. It's not too crowded on a Friday night and it's not deafeningly loud. It's a perfect kind of place to me."}
{"text":"I came to the Foundation Room for the first time with a friend after being enticed with the promise of comped entry and free drinks from a well known promoter. The entry line was short and we waited less than three minutes to get in. Once inside, we headed straight to the bar to get our drinks. At this point, I was getting pretty wary because to get free drinks, you typically need a wristband or drink tickets but we had received nil. I approached the bartender and asked about the open bar for chicks and she rudely responded \"You need drink tickets\".  Okay, where do I find those? \"Go ask the hostess\".   We made our way back to the hostess stand, where I was ignored for what seemed like ages. Finally the chatty employees realized someone was standing in front of them. I asked about drink tickets and again, was met with rudeness. \"The host at check-in downstairs was supposed to give them to you. You have to go back down.\" Well, this sucks. I contemplated simply leaving. Back down the elevators we went. I had to wait in line AGAIN and asked for drink tickets this time. We got 2 each.  I texted the promoter and told him about all this BS, and he actually contacted the manager of Foundation Room, who texted me back in minutes. He told me where to find him and once I did, he apologized and then gave my friend and I 6 more drink tickets. That almost made up for the debacle I was made to contend with.  Now that we could finally relax, we meandered around the small lounge and got to enjoy the view of the city. It is jam packed out on the balcony, so good luck finding a spot! The music is deplorable and was mostly outdated pop music. I'll admit the vibe was pretty cool - there was an eastern theme going on with statues of Buddha and elephants. Later in the night, women came out dressed as belly dancers and danced on top of platforms. The crowd is mostly older. I wouldn't describe Foundation Room as a lounge because when it's hard to walk around and make conversation, you're no longer considered a lounge, you're a friggin club.   Worth a Return Visit? The promoter and the manager were the saving graces of my experience at Foundation Room. Had it not been for their swift corrective actions, I would've wrote Foundation Room off forever. Even so, coming back is a big maybe.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #137"}
{"text":"Not a fan of Restaurant Week, the opinion that a donation can be made to one's favorite charity anonymously without suffering a plug and chug menu for the masses apparently uncommon in modern society, it was largely a result of longtime curiosity that led to dinner at The House of Blues Foundation Room on Saturday night.  Famously known as the lone occupant of Mandalay Bay's 63rd Floor, a Restaurant-slash-Nightclub that remains one of Sin City's lone proponents of a dress-code demanding Business Casual or better, it is within the hotel lobby that guests will find elevators behind a velvet rope, the ascent fairly quick to a space designed to impress and staff clearly hired as much for their looks as abilities to seat and serve.  One of eight such venues across America, the recent hiring of Chef Corey Miller from Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak at MGM promising upcoming menu changes per a middle-aged male waiter, it is after passing by statues of Buddha and other Deities that guests are seated in a room of polished wood with a balcony offering a panoramic view of Las Vegas Boulevard, a \"guest-list\" and/or cover charge apparently the only way to assure admission after dark on busier nights.  Priced significantly higher than House of Blues Restaurant or recently introduced B-Side, Happy Hour in the spacious Bar offering some good deals Sunday through Thursday while the current Restaurant Week three-course offers over 25% off a collection of longtime signatures, it was with Strip-priced Cocktails deferred that a Bread Basket appeared featuring five options alongside three Dips or Spreads, the fact that some were still warm a nice touch though only the Ciabatta lightly speckled with Olives and Crisps spread with Red Pepper Hummus proved worth more than a single taste.  Playing mid-tempo Pop overhead, the lack of Blues or even Rock telling as much about Foundation Room's target audience as a menu loosely rooted in the South but otherwise nondescript American 'Steakhouse,' it was with \"Salmon and a Salad with Dressing on the side\" tourists seated on both sides that Foundation Room's \"Jumbo\" Lump Crabcakes were presented, the adjective in reference not to portion but the chunks of sweet Crustacean that showed well without much binder beneath a fairly basic Apple and Fennel Salad.    Decidedly curious about $40 Shrimp and Grits, \"My Cousin Vinny\" quotes about *Magic* Grits seemingly the only explanation for such a price, it was perhaps predictable that neither portion nor presentation outperformed what one gets at Yardbird for $28 or down South for $15, the fact that Shrimp were well cooked but largely overwhelmed by spices and salinity also worth noting.  Excellent in terms of service, both the Waiter and Runners present without being obtrusive and always quick to clear plates or refill Water, it was after Chef Miller toured the room checking in on guests that Dessert was presented, a small ramekin with bubbling Berries at the base and Custard-soaked Cubes of Bread beneath melting Peanut Butter Ice Cream definitely the night's highlight while \"fresh baked\" Cookies that arrived no more than five minutes after ordering were probably better described as \"warmed-to-order,\" the flavors just fine but texture medium-crisp from edge to center and none as noteworthy as the Bourbon Vanilla Ice Cream that is sweet yet subtle and one of the better scoops in Sin City.  TWO AND A HALF STARS:  Undeniably a concept more about the scene than its cuisine The House of Blues Foundation Room offers an experience well-suited to tourists and something 'fancy' but accessible, though with so many great Restaurants at Mandalay Bay and Rivea offering a better view at a similar pricepoint there seems little reason to book a table rather than just stopping in for Ice Cream or a Drink at the Bar."}
{"text":"The Foundation Room sits at the very top of Mandalay Bay.  This place doubles as a swanky 5-star restaurant and an ultra lounge. I don't dare call it a nightclub because it by no means belongs in the same class and caliber as Marquee, Tryst, or XS.  The crowd here tends to be older, I would say 40-something is the median age. Tons of plush seating and the walls are covered in tapestry. Foundation has a very middle eastern feel to it.  What makes Foundation Room stand out to me is that hands down, this place has the most amazing night time views of the Las Vegas Strip. Seated at the very south end of elegant Las Vegas Blvd, you see all of the high rises as well as downtown Las Vegas. The patio is always stuffed with older gentlemen, suited up, and puffing on cigars (it's that snazzy kind of joint).  A little know tip is that Foundation Room used to be ultra exclusive. Invite Only status. Thankfully, it is now open to the general public. There is a cover charge or you can always call ahead (check Twitter or Facebook) and be placed on the guest list. The music varies from night to night depending on the DJ (most, in my experience tend to be Top 40 to 80s genre of music), but I have never heard house or hip-hop dominate a night.  Strict dress code enforced."}
{"text":"I was tempted to give this place two stars, but I'll explain why.  First and foremost, the view from their balcony is absolutely the best thing about this place.  It offers one of the best views of the Strip you can possibly get.  My date and I got free tickets to go up and enjoy the place.  It has a really cool vibe to it, as well.  But, unfortunately, my date was Completely ignored by the bartender when he went to get a drink.  He stood there 20 minutes(!!), with a $100 bill in his hand, all the while trying to get the guy's attention and watching others get served.  Finally my date told him he was the worst bartender he'd ever met.  Best part: the guy didn't even react.  Wow, Foundation Room.  Way to not impress.  Bottom line: go for the view.  If you're lucky you might not be ignored by the bartender."}
{"text":"As dance clubs go, this one was pretty, loud, crowded, and hot. It has a superb view of the strip, enhanced by the free champagne or cocktail. The dancing girls and decor are worth the stop itself. The ceiling is low and the room is small - so be prepared to feel cramped. Overall, it was worth the view but not the wait or sweating."}
{"text":"Great decor with an amazing view! The private rooms are a must see even when you're there. Religious people may find it a bit offensive but I didn't think so. It's a great display of Indian culture in an atmosphere of fun and frolic!  I didn't eat here so I can't comment on that. But I will say that the service was very good. If you find yourself and Mandalay Bay please do yourself a favor and go take a look!"}
{"text":"Just as all the reviews have mentioned, this is one of the best views in Vegas.   I came here on Sunday night and the place was pretty dead. I went out to the balcony, ordered a drink, and was out there alone. I was able to enjoy the view alone for a long time until a couple of parties made their way to the balcony. It was nice though. The cocktail menu is pretty standard and service was good.   I highly recommend this place to people that want to admire the view of the Strip."}
{"text":"Adored this place! Wow the view!  Taking a separate elevator to the 63rd floor of Mandalay Bay with a breathtaking view is well worth it! We ran into some people who raved about the food.  We went up for the view, which if your looking for that quiet spot with a great view of the strip this is the place to hit. With an Indian Buddhist decor feel it creates such a sacred and intimate vibe. The DJ was getting set up when we departed but I'm sure that would be a cool place to spend a fun bumpin' evening.  The restaurant section is in its own area and then you have a luxury intimate patio with heaters and great couch seating. Take some photos seriously!  Unique, classy beverages, and really great staff. Our server gave us a tour of the entire space including the members only section and their personal storage cubbies . So cool!  I would come back to eat here and bring friends for sure!"}
{"text":"The Foundation Room offers a remarkable view of the Las Vegas strip from the balcony of the 64th floor, day or night. In the lounge, Steve, the bartender was friendly, fun to talk to, knowledgeable, and made fantastic sidecar drinks. We enjoyed walking around the lounge visiting the side rooms and viewing the artifacts on the walls. The ceilings are quite impressive and decorative. In the restaurant, our waiter Sean and his assistant were friendly, funny, attentive, and helpful. The food was delicious! My husband enjoyed the grouper. I had shrimp cocktail (6 large pieces), filet mignon (tender and full of flavor) Oscar-style (w/lobster chunks, mashed potatoes, and asparagus).  Because we were celebrating our anniversary, they treated us to three sweet and tasty cookies (pistachio, chocolate, and one more) with lavender ice cream. Yummy! We left before the music started because we had tickets to see Michael Jackson One (Cirque de Soleil), but they encouraged us to get our hands stamped and return for the music. Great staff at the Foundation room."}
{"text":"Beautiful place to come for a night out! Bring a group of girlfriends and get ready to dance. Loved the music and the DJ. Also love the lounge area to kick it when you get tired of walking around in your stilettos! The drinks are pretty pricey but when in Vegas...I guess. LOVE the view from the balcony. Incredible. We did not eat here but I'll have to check out the food from next time! Definitely dress nice and look the part."}
{"text":"Great club/Lounge. Excellent service and bottle service is a must. The view in the patio is also wonderful. Special thanks to Dimitri and Kristina S for their excellenct customer service and friendliness."}
{"text":"View is amazing!  Awesome layout and decor!  Stong Drinks...  But the DJ needs to get it together...  Credit for doing the video mixing, but music was just all over the place. Couldn't get into the groove...   Please fix as I enjoyed this place otherwise..."}
{"text":"Gorgeous view!! Great Bartenders & yummy food!! I love going here just to kick back with friends on a Tuesday night. The only downfall is the music. Please please fix that! Even if they don't, I'll continue to come :)"}
{"text":"As classy and fun as it gets! Went for restaurant week. Such a beautiful environment! Our server was knowledgeable and amazing! And the food was impeccable. DEFINATELY get the apple bread pudding served in an adorable mini cast iron skillet with bourbon ice cream!!!!"}
{"text":"Well, if you are looking for a Vegas experience..you can't go wrong here. Took my son and nephew and the table service was top notch. The views from the balcony are worth the fee."}
{"text":"One word...AMAZING. I went with my boyfriend and our friends. We had a connection. We got to skip the line and go up the amazing elevator. We got to see the lockers that exclusive members (Justin Timberlake, Jay Z, ect) keep their booze in. We also got bottle service which was totally worth it. We got sat in one of the lounge rooms. We were pleased with the incredibly comfortable couches. The waitress was so nice and amazing. The female restroom attendant was also very nice.   When I walked onto the balcony my jaw dropped. Words cannot describe the view.  Being from Colorado, this was my first \"exclusive\" nightclub I had ever been too. Because of our connection we got a very good deal including free bottle service. It would be very pricey to go to if you did not have a discount. Drinks are VERY expensive. The view alone is worth the money!"}
{"text":"Good music..... horrible staff. Just wanted two feet of room to dance with my husband and got shuffled around FOUR times.  The only place your allowed to be is the \"dance floor\" which is actually just a walk way , NOT a dance floor. Thankfully we  got in free-because id be pissed if we payed for that nonsense. The staff was rude every time.... on serious power trips."}
{"text":"I came here for a private event so I did not dine here...and the service is always going to be excellent due to it being a private event so I cannot tell you what the actual level of service would be...  Foundation Room is hands down about the view. It does block out the view of Luxor (unlike mix) however it has a great view of the strip. The outside patio was underwhelming and looked very plain...maybe because I was there late afternoon....The inside had the same theme as Mandalay Bay in the subtle south east asian vibe...very antique looking...again this maybe because there was a lot of natural sunlight in the venue (majority of nightlife venues would look underwhelming during the day...)...very private venue that feels catered towards the older crowd  The apps being passed around were decent...not horrible but not great.  The private events tied with House of Blues Foundation Room members and the view are the standouts with it also being a great private space for your group."}
{"text":"Great views, nice drinks, and you feel like the king of the world!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The view of Vegas is spectacular, great choice of music, host that are really helpful, bottle prices very reasonable, waitress's were awesome! Had an amazing time here!! Def will be back here next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went here to celebrate a 30th birthday. I requested bottle service ahead of time and Luis was awesome. He kept in contact with me to make sure I got what I needed. The atmosphere was cool and relaxed. The music was great and people were dancing. Definitely a little older 20's crowd which was fine with me. The views were amazing and the music was great too! Definitely a spot to see and have a drink. Prices were decent for Vegas too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Huge portions. Great food. Reservations recommended. Beautiful strip views. A must do since its now open to the public.  To save money on this one, visit restaurant.com sign up for their emails, watch for the 80% off sale. Then you can pick up a $50 voucher for $4.00 must spend over $100 but not hard to do. Our total was $135 - $50 = $85 plus tip!   Another trick if you want to party here, grab dinner before hand with reservations and then stay the rest of the night in the lounge."}
{"text":"[Two stars for the OK food and the amazing view]  Big 40th birthday celebration for my buddy. Our waiter, Shawn started out strong and then, as the restaurant converted to \"club\" mode and the tables filled up, he became distracted. By mid-meal, it was right up there with the worst service I've ever received. The birthday boy was bummed and I was pissed that he was bummed.   To add insult to injury, the check arrives (early-- we just wanted to get out of there at this point) with a 20% gratuity added. I found the maitre'd (who never so much as glanced in the direction of our table all night) and told him that I wanted the gratuity removed so we could tip what we felt was appropriate for the horrible service we received. This dude had the gall to argue with me about it-- telling me that they add that gratuity specifically so that \"people like you won't stiff our waitstaff\". I told him if he wanted us to pay the bill and leave without making a scene, he would do as I asked.   Long story short, the gratuity was removed, I tipped Shawn less than 10% and we split. Evening ruined. Thanks for a great time, Foundation Room!  :P"}
{"text":"Our friends reserved a VIP space which happened to be the only VIP space on the balcony (In the center with 3 couches and a table). While I felt a bit bad that others couldn't get the best view from the balcony, I was very impressed with the atmosphere and service provided. I would definitely recommend this space to others looking for a memorable night with friends.   The only issue I had was when we were trying to enter and gave our names at the door, it took them 3 times to check the list before they finally found the names. For a higher end place, you'd expect better service, but one slip up on the night is understandable."}
{"text":"I looked and looked, but I couldn't find a listing on Yelp for the House of Blues Foundation Room Restaurant. I saw reviews for the nightclub which opens at ten each night, which is a separate business on the same floor...but a world away from this very nice restaurant. I had a Sapphire martini with crab cakes, beef carpaccio (with a quail egg yolk, crispy garlic, and chives) and a papaya salad to start. They were all good -- but the carpaccio was the star. For the main course I wanted steak, so I went with the Wagyu strip. It was very flavorful, but had a little too much crust/bark for me. Overall, this is a very nice, swanky restaurant. Don't confuse it with the reviews for the nightclub of the same name."}
{"text":"The architecture and design of this bar is phenomenal! I only knock off a star because the bar service was frustratingly slow. We waited on one side of the bar and although bartenders walked right past us, no one ever acknowledged us. Then we were told the lady would be helping us, who when we looked over was just having a good time with her coworker so we proceeded to go to the other side of the bar. Mind you the bar was fairly empty and only had another group standing at the bar. Steve finished up with the other customer and we were finally served our drinks.  The view here is absolutely stunning."}
{"text":"If you get the chance to get into the Foundation Room, go! The view is fantastic and the experience is unique.   The first time I went here was about 5 years ago. I have gone every year since. It has changed a little over the years, but it is always a great time. The drinks are good, and surprisingly, not too expensive.    It is fun to people watch here ... cause you can run into all kinds of characters. People watching is a sport at the Foundation Room!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to the Foundation Room in years and wanted to take my husband who had never been.  We had reservations for dinner at 9:30 and it was rather quiet.  We were told to wait, but i wasn't sure what we were waiting for...3/4 of the dining room tables were empty.  They finally gave us a table right as you walked in the door..horrible table.  We asked if could move and they escorted us out of the restaurant to wait.... We instead walked to the bar area.  My husband ordered a manhattan and I asked about the wines by the glass.  My husband was served a drink in what looked like a juice glass.  When he inquired about his Manhattan, she simply stated that is your Manhattan and walked away.  I asked another bartender if he knew how to make a Manhattan, he said of course.  And in about 2 minutes it was sitting in front of us.  When Autumn (our bartender) came back, she was pissed!!!  and started chewing out the other bartender....really????  By this time, she was practically shoving my wine at me... This is only a sample of our 5 minute bar experience.....I could go on and on, but I won't as I am not a fan of really long reviews. We finally were seated for dinner... Our waiter for dinner was very nice and pleasant. Dinner was just OK.... Would I go back....absolutely NO!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous view! The space is compact, however.   I prefer Voodoo Lounge at the Rio since the patio outside is bigger and they also have a dance floor.  But if you just want to lounge, this is he place to be!"}
{"text":"Sasha R. I would be willing to discuss this further with you. Please send me an email address to contact you at."}
{"text":"Okay so the view is great. I got in on a Thursday through a connection. The place was not so busy. I liked the decor. It was private and cosy. Just the place to take your companion. I'd go again.   Video of the View: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JHDfj7xBpY"}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp & grits ... omg... my mouth was in heaven... It literally melted in my mouth. The appetizer breads, were also awesome ! everything is just awesome!! nothing negative. It's so great you have to go for yourself to find out. Details on here will not help you at all. It has to be a personal experience."}
{"text":"The food was so good. I had pork belly and grits as an appetizer. I couldn't get enough. Then for dinner I had blackened Grouper. It was the best blackened fish I ever had and I'm from New Orleans. We got an awesome tour from  Nina. Worth every cent. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is the private club inside House of Blues at Mandalay Bay.  The décor and ambiance in this restaurant are top notch.  When you add in the view from the balcony, this is the most visually spectacular restaurant in Las Vegas...nothing else even close.  The service is also outstanding and if you are an actually member of this private club (I was a guest), prepare to receive very personalized service.    You will feel like a rock star whether you're eating, drinking or just smoking a cigar (yes, they sell them to smoke on the outdoor balcony) at this awesome restaurant.  The food is also really good, but not as \"stand out\" as the ambiance and service.  It is an expensive place, but if you're a member, you'll receive a 20% discount...but it's still expensive.  I had the lamb shank which was delivered without any room for improvement.  Our table also had sides of creamy spinach, macaroni and cheese, and risotto.  All the sides were delicious.  My wife had the pork chop, which she thought was a little dry and over cooked, but still flavorful.  The members we went had the pork chop (which he also thought was dry, but flavorful) and the horseradish crusted tenderloin (which she thought was slightly overcooked).  Overall, the food was really good, but there is room for improvement.  Food-4 stars, Ambiance-5+ stars, Value-4 stars, Service-5+.  I know my average is not really 5 stars, but I'm giving the Foundation Room 5 stars because the ambiance, patio view and service were unsurpassed."}
{"text":"Since we were at the Mandalay Bay, we decided to check out the Foundation Room.  Lucky for us, there wasn't a line and we didn't have to pay a cover. We take an elevator to the 22nd floor and there was a cool loungey area with fireplaces and couches.  They played top forty and some old school....like I Wanna Sex You Up and Poison....Too bad I had my heels otherwise I would've battled some of the youngin's with some old school dance moves :)  The best part was the outdoor area where the view of the strip is awesome.  Bascially, you are at the top of the building near the Mandalay Bay sign.  Awesome!  The crowd was mixed, not too young or too old.  It was crowded, but not too packed, I was able to get a stool near the bar and chill for awhile. I wasn't expecting this place to be so cool.  I really liked it."}
{"text":"The front door staff encouraged a group of men to bully me for entertainment. If you'd like to be scared and threatened by circus clowns this is the place for your When friends finally met me there they continued to bully the group and say we'd have no where to sleep. As a female run from this place"}
{"text":"Great meal. Staff was very attentive and made the environment a pleasure. Can't wait for another meal on our next visit!"}
{"text":"I am not sure how this place got 4 stars.... Mandalay Bay must have paid alot of fake people to write reviews.  Lets start......  I called in to reserve for two people and a few of my buddies showed up.  $10 cover charge to go up.    Fine... we went up and the place is small, poorly decorated, and crowded.  The drinks are over priced as usual... and alot of \"older\" 40+ men frequent here with 40-60 here old ladies.  NOt exactly... my type of crowd.    And, the famous balcony.... NOT!  Its a small walk way with rail.  You can see the south end of the strip.... not an exciting view.    To be honest, this place blows and not really worth it.  I heavily recommend you take the same money and go to playboy mansion and night bar at The Palms casino or the high level bar at Stratosphere."}
{"text":"********************** 1560 *****************     Always enjoy my visit here, spectacular view of the strip, nice layout, good lineup artists/DJs, having a table service is a must!      MLife members always get special treatments! One of my favorites in Vegas."}
{"text":"I really love the Foundation Room. It's always packed with girls my age and men my dad's age. Oh wait a minute...!  No really. In Vegas, where the average skirt length is 8\" and the cup size is a D, I'd say the Foundation Room somehow attracts people who are a TINY bit more conservative, which is all you need, because it IS Vegas after all, not church.   And for those of you who do want a little more sin, they have 2 dancers dancing around in their bikinis, just because.   And we did get really stiff drinks, they didn't cost me a kidney, the view is spectacular. It's almost worth walking to from the other end of the strip! And on hot summer nights, I have a feeling the outdoor area will be even more popular than ever - smokers rejoice and congregate.   I also really love the outside bar with dance area - it's not too big and not too small, and there are sectioned off areas for VIP's. Maybe if your feet get too tired someone will take pity on you and let you rest there, then feed you Moet to cool you off.   Lastly, my absolute favorite thing about the Foundation Room is the fact that there's an elevator to take you up there. No waiting in line, no classless drunk girls puking by your feet, no crowds. Just guys in suits standing by the elevator to take you upstairs to an exclusive feeling club!"}
{"text":"Great service and conversation from the bartender. I liked the drinks - Alabama Slammer - and actually thought they were worth their price ($12). The view from the balcony is great. I was recently up in the Stratosphere Tower for dinner and I have to say this view is better. It's closer to the heart of the strip and of course less crowded than at the Stratosphere. The lifts to take you up more than 60 floors are located near the concierge and beach level escalators inside Mandalay Bay. Closest to east valet."}
{"text":"Nicole was an amazing server. She was one of two people serving the entire rear of the upstairs dining room. She was efficient, friendly, talkative, funny, didn't make 1 mistake - everything you'd want in a waitress. The experience up here was wonderful. Our meal was great! I loved the black Grouper fish special and the broconili was cooked perfectly. The dining room is a very unique space, but calming and a peaceful place to dine. It is a very different atmosphere from the downstairs part of the HOB - it retains the same spirit but in a less crazy way. The patio gives a nice look of E4th St. After our meal our waitress took us on a tour of the area showing us the different rooms of the bar that can be reserved and giving us a glimpse in the music room which overlooks from above the backstage area of the HOB concert hall. I will definitely be back here and bring more of my friends and hopefully run into Nicole again! This time around I was showing the place off to a friend in from Chicago and I think she definitely made him feel welcome."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this place.  After having dinner over at Mix on a Monday night, the wine sommelier (I forget his name, but he was truly a refreshing change from the norm in Vegas) offered to make a call over to Foundation to ensure that our party would be able to get in.  I was initially worried because our group consisted of 4 males - me being the only female.  Nevertheless, we had no problems at the door (not even a cover), and up the elevator 50 floors we went.  Foundation room is very aesthetically pleasing, as it is decorated in an old-world gypsy/indian/bhuddist theme with lots of lavish fabrics and oriental rugs.  It was a pleasure to wander around from room to room and explore what each had to offer, and every room offered amazing views of the sparkling city.  The rooms are all located off of a long hallway, each one having a different musical theme.  We spent most of our time in the hip hop room and out on the marvelous balcony.   The view, people.  You look straight down the strip, with the huge Mandalay Bay sign at your level just feet away in all its glittering glory.  The balcony is quite large, and there was ample seating for everyone.    The only negative thing that happened here was how some racist douchebag made a derogatory comment towards a woman right in front of us.  He would have been a real downer if it weren't for the fabulousness of Foundation room that made up for his idiocy."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best views of the strip.   The drinks are strong, service is great, the food is good (albeit expensive) and of course the outside balcony is gorgeous.   I've never been here very late, always during business happy hours so I can't speak to the late night crowd, but I always make it a point to come here for a drink."}
{"text":"Looking for a great view, dinner and nightclub all is one? This is the place for you. Located on the 63rd floor of Mandalay Bay is a breath taking view of the Las Vegas Strip. Dinner is served from nightly from 6pm until 11pm. After wards there is a DJ performing all night with Top 40 hits and Hip Hop. Check out Bubbles for Beauties Ladies Night Hosted Champagne and Vodka bar every Friday and Saturday from 10pm to Midnight."}
{"text":"I can't tell if this is the restaurant or the bar that I'm reviewing. I can't find anything but this, but it seems like most reviews are for the club/bar. Whatever.   I was kind of drawn to this place due to the reputation it has for the view - but I think I missed the view. From the Restaurant itself, it's not really that fantastic. I had to have been in the wrong spot. It was nice, don't get me wrong, but not breathtaking. And, I do want to mention the incense smell when you step off the elevator...it reeks. To me, all incense reminds me of urinal cakes. Don't ask me why, don't try to rationalize it...but it does. And that's not what I want to smell whilst eating.   To the food - I started with a Caesar salad, which was fine. Pretty normal - a thinner than expected dressing, good greens, good cheese...oh, and what made it worthwhile? A giant cracker made entirely of baked cheese. Amazing. Worth ordering just for that.   My entree was a New York Strip, supposedly dry aged even though the menu didn't note this (and I would think would do so if it were true, as that's a selling point). The steak was well cooked, nice grill crust, nice and juicy. A little tooth, but nothing out of the ordinary. Honestly, my first and last bites were best, as those delicious end pieces have more of the salty peppery grill crust. So maybe they could amp that up a little bit. Along with it came some nice kale and a white cheddar au gratin, and the steak was topped with some coarse mustard ale butter. That butter was a really nice surprise, and I think it probably made the meal. The tangy mustard wasn't harsh, but was a great accompaniment for the savory au gratin, the slightly bitter kale, and the salty steak. Cut through what might have been a kind of uniform tasting meal. I've not seen mustard like that used as a sauce on a steak, but I applaud it. Without the sauce, this is probably a 3, but with, I think it's a 4. I didn't leave any behind.   Service was good, not rushed (even though dining alone, I'd almost prefer to be rushed out of the place - what else do I do while I'm waiting for the next course or the check?). They do offer your choice of white or black napkins, which is a nice touch. And the price was reasonable for a good steak, especially when it comes with a few little sides rather than just being meat on a plate. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Rude. Did not actually let us into club after making us ride up and down in elevator for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Cool place for its stunning views of the strip. Very packed with bodies, but good music for dancing, if you can find some floor space. Bartenders were overwhelmed and slow. Not sure why, but 20 minutes at least to order a drink. Cool for one time."}
{"text":"On top of the 60- something -ish floor of Mandalay Bay, is this club. Its beautiful. Its dark, the scent of nag champa lingers. The wall is detailed with indian tapestry and carved wood. Truly sexy and alluring.  A few nice sitting areas. A kick ass balcony with a second bar, and full view of the south end of the strip.  Its not a big club, but more of a social hide away.  You can get private rooms for a higher price of course. Those look lil opium dens with big screen Tvs. Everything up there is sultry, and mysterious. There is a restaurant a across from the lounge I have not yet tried, but it smells very good.  Bathrooms clean, very nice lady attendant.  Music was a little top 40is, with a mixture of house. Better if they played more house/ sophisticated edm ."}
{"text":"Good drinks. Great Views. Balcony is tight just like others have said. Our waitress Courtney was Awesome and very helpful...the bartenders were not as nice...oh well...it is for sure worth going just for the view alone."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch for an eclipse viewing party.  I was totally underwhelmed.  The food (buffet style) was no better than what you'd get at a buffet for $11.99.  Food was cold...bacon, sausage, quiche (burned on the bottom), home fried potatoes, roasted chicken with undercooked green beers.  All of it was cold and no better than what I cook at home!  It is also very dark and depressing inside.  I felt like I was inside the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland.    I hope this is not indicative of their evening menu.  The ONLY reason for the one star?  The view!  A spectacular view looking down from the south end of The Strip."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the view was amazing, and there are always interesting people to meet here. I also got engaged here! I had the scallops and my fiancée had the steak. The scallops were sweet and salty and ontop of a bed of sweet mashed potatoes. It was really interesting. All of the flavors from all of the elements on the plate complemented eachother very well."}
{"text":"I definitely give this 1 star for the view- the outside terrace just gives you a panoramic view of the strip and when the weather is warm- you get that balmy feeling... the inside in done up in a pacific tiki interior- from chairs to the walls...a little too dark for my liking but definitely deserves the intimate feel it possess 2 stars...drinks are well made...3stars"}
{"text":"Ok. To whoever said it has the best view, this is false. The patio at this club/bar is tiny and the view is not as good as at MIX, which is in the same hotel. However, one evening MIX was closed and they sent us to foundation room. They charged a cover for the guys (originally $30 but we negotiated down to $10) and chicks were free. Once we were upstairs we entered what looked like the haunted hotel. It was very dark, rock and roll, with a bit of an osbournes feel. It smelled like incense. Inside the bar there's about 4 sections with couches and chairs which you can reserve, and there are two private rooms as well, away from the bar and the music. The bar and dancefloor are a bit small but the music was fantastic. On a Monday night, we had a crowd in there that was unreal. By midnight it was so packed you could barely get across the room. Very happening place. We had a blast and I'd definitely come back. On a quiet night I imagine it would still be a great little spot for a drink."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic dinner here with my husband. The view is fantastic and the food was amazing. When we were asked what special occasion we were celebrating (my birthday), the waiter brought out some homemade giant cookies on the house! A great experience, and I look forward to coming back at a warmer time of year!"}
{"text":"So the place wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular. The view was awesome, the lay out was awesome, but the people were mediocre. The staff was super, super nice. But there was nothing going on other than 5 groups of girls doing their own personal photo shoot/ top model rehersal. There also wasn't any music going on in the 2nd half of the outdoor patio. Needless to say, even at midnight, we left because things were just too...too...too meh. Maybe it was the night, but still. What the hell?"}
{"text":"It is fun to people watch here ...People watching is a sport at the Foundation Room! I agree. you have to be in the know. It's definitely the place where it's MEMBERS ONLY!  memberships are soo ridiculous in annual fee. That's no wonder you see 50 something men trying to act in their 20's.  Ive been here 2 times. The first in August 2008 during Magic Convention, it was a Monday night GODSPEED @ Foundation Room Mondays.... It was lame I was so hyped up and NO ACTION.   Drinks are standard. I had a Greyhound with Kettle One and my friend had a red bull something...  The view was WOWZERS!!!!!! all I have to say. AMAZING view from top of the Mandalay Bay Hotel is magnificent. top notch at night.  The second time I was here on a Thursday night in September 2008 with a few business vendors. OVERALL it's a snazzy place to be and be seen, the decor is very pristine, manor/mansion legacy decor. The dining room is lavish 50 seat table. Dark mahogany carved wood, leading to outdoor patio balcony. Heavy draped curtains leading to many secret rooms. Lighting is dim and red... very intimate. I like the wine lockers by the main elevators, classy.  I will return if another invitation was offered. WHY NOT!? ;p"}
{"text":"3 stars only because we liked the Temple room.  A free place to sit in a nightclub, how rare is that!!  The lingerie dancers were fun to watch as was the naked chick on the patio who was being painted.  The music was eehh and at one point the whole place smelled like horribly rotten eggs.  It was disgusting and cleared out the room.  Eventually they lit some incense, thank goodness.  Stayed for a few hours.  Might go back.  It was free to get in for ladies and $20 for men with our VIP passes that were being handed out in the casino."}
{"text":"\"GET READY, SHAVE!\" was the gentle message I received on a Tueday night. '\"Why?\" I whine.....  \" it's the Vegasinc Women to Watch 2012 awards\" says Wifee.   Women to watch I muse, Julia Roberts?, Madonna ? Who? .....surely not a Kardashian I hope. But this is Vegas it's probably a Hilton?  Alas, none of the above, it was a ceremony honoring local business women, usual suspects including Dawn Gibbons ex wife of some ex- someone.  So arriving at Mandalay Bay, I'm disappointed the Valet guys are grumpy and don't seem to really want to park your car. \" Where is The Foundation Room?\" I politely ask the grumpy munchkin, \"There's a sign by the elevator\".  Inside, no obvious elevator so we wander around an almost empty gaming floor until we find the correct one. Front door, turn left towards the shops.  Private lift to a very high floor, unusual room, decorated like I picture Genghis Khans private boudoir. Fancy carpets, Buddhas, cool art.   More grumpy staff behind the bar, is it because everything is comped? Don't know but grumpy no less. Outside there is a cool large balcony with a view worthy of the price of admission.   Because it was an early award thingamabob there was little in the way of food, some cheese and chocolate covered strawberries but free Martinis , that's ok!   A maze of a place and after spending a couple of hours there I am still not sure whether The Foundation Room is a restaurant, club, lounge, combo or merely HQ for grumpy staff. But looks very cool, a little different, awesome views and one day I'll return and figure out its true identity."}
{"text":"Recently went here the other night after dinner at RM. Overall, its more lounge then night club which was exactly what I was looking for. There are multiple rooms that are great if you get bottle service and have a large party. Also, no one has a comparable view down the strip from their open air veranda.   If you have the chance, definitely stop by, get dressed up and check this place out."}
{"text":"Best club in Vegas!!!  Outstanding ambiance, with alluringly seductive rooms with outstanding decor, each with different types of music.  There is also a decently sized balcony that overlooks the strip (how do you beat that?).  The music (DJ) is just amazing and you can't beat the ambiance, it never gets too packed or stuffy like the rest of Vegas' clubs.    Hands down the best club!"}
{"text":"Great place, great time, great life. Crowded,  hot, but elegantly done. Service is okay, given they're all extremely busy. Definately a place to go back to if you are into the Vegas scene."}
{"text":"Once reserved for \"members only\", various reasons have allowed for the velvet ropes to be pushed aside for the plebians! The balcony is a great photo opportunity, and you can get a new perspective on the Strip each time when comparing pics taken over many years! There is an intimate/swanky feel to this \"ultralounge\", with multiple rooms and seating areas inside & out.  It's sorta like a maze to navigate throughout the different rooms, and this adds to the mystery of the joint. I took 2 first timers here recently, one from out of town. She was impressed with the $5 wine special and the fact that we didn't have to pay a cover, so all in all not a bad evening. I also attended a martini camp that was advertised on the House of Blues/Foundation Room Web site and turned out to be mostly Foundation Room members. It was a good time with instruction on mixing 3 different martinis and a swag bag for everyone!"}
{"text":"I part hosted a business dinner, and was in charge of finding a place.  Our group was in the Mandalay Bay/Delano, so it was a no-brainer to provide this experience with ease.  Not having to worry/plan for multiple taxi's/uber to go somewhere else along the strip was priceless.  The Foundation Room, if it isn't clear, is the House of Blues VIP / Club.  The entrance inside the Mandalay Bay is very nice and feels exclusive.  A hostess ensuring your reservation, and a security guard.  Once you pass, your headed in an elevator direct to the 63rd floor.  Exit, and head straight to another hostess, and your led to the bar area (if you chose dinner, until your table is ready).  I love the feel of the bar, which has an wonderful textured ceiling, very hindu-temple / mosque-like.  Then, boom -- you get a glimpse of the view, and you can step outside to the patio.  Wow!  An amazing view worthy of a selfy and tons of pics.  Because Mandalay is at the end of the strip, it's a unique viewpoint because you can see all of the strip, and certainly, at that height it's tremendous.  Later, as the night goes on 10pm-ish, it's filled up, and features go-go dancers.  It gets quite loud, so earlier 8pm-ish is more my style.  Our group of 10 were led to a back room for dining.  The room sat 80-100, a nice size, not too big and not too small -- perfect.  The menu allowed for us to find great things to order for unique drinks, delicious appetizers, and tantalizing entrees -- mostly in the seafood and steak variety, with a southern twist.  We ordered the Jalapeno-Cheese Cornbread [$10, 4.5 stars], the Shellfish Tower appetizer [$90, 4.5 stars] and my main, Shrimp & Grits [$40, 4.0 stars].  All in all, very good.  Service was outstanding.  I'd definitely go back sometime, not often, but in the every 2-3 years rotation.  A couple of notes: ============== 1) You can't see any live music from the Foundation Room, which is located at another location downstairs. 2) In no way compares to the experience of the Hollywood Foundation Room, now closed/defunct.  It was a better dining experience, and you needed to be a VIP or member to get in (or a friend of a member)."}
{"text":"My parents took me and a few friends to Vegas for my 21st birthday and he pops was real excited to show me the view of the strip from the Foundation Room.   We shared bottle service out on the balcony and had a really good time!   I can't speak for the crowd inside, but walking through on our way out to the balcony it at least looked really nice.   Most of that trip was sort of foggy so I'm a little sorry I couldn't be more specific.   Like everything else in Vegas this place was super spensy, so come prepared to drop some serious coin."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great service, great view and great room, The House of Blues Foundation Room Las Vegas is your place.  The transformation between sunset and night views is pleasure to see from the top of the Mandalay Bay porch.  The service was great. Our servers, Jenny and Raquel, and the rest of The Foundation Room team, were top notch.  They were welcoming our guests on the ground floor, showing them to our reception area and being very accommodating.  Gold Membership has its privileges and The Foundation Room lived up to it!  Thank you."}
{"text":"Not my kind of place.....It's too dark, the ceilings are low and the walls and floors are covered in carpets and fabric so it makes the place seem darker, smaller and very claustrophobic.  We spotted Charles Barkley...man, he's short!"}
{"text":"Had such a good time here! Did something different and checked out the non-club events and saw a comedy show. We arrived early and decided to grab a drink and enjoy the view and ended up ordering a quick nosh with another round of cocktails. We ordered the yellowtail bruschetta and cauliflower tempura. The tempura was served with a ponzu and sriracha aioli. Both were tasty but I preferred the spicy aioli to the sweeter ponzu. The yellowtail was my favorite. I could eat that everyday. It definitely made me want to check out their full menu. The comedy show was great! They featured some great comedians. I had only heard of one (K-Von) but I enjoyed Stacey Tisdale, too. Foundation Room is actually huge, and the party had started by the time the show was over. We spent a few minutes enjoying the atmosphere but it was packed, (the only thing that wasn't so great), so we called it a night. Great venue - I would love to see some decent local bands or even a national act there, some time."}
{"text":"This review is for the foundation room restaurant. We went with a party of some Vegas VIPs and we were so disappointed with everything about the restaurant, and we are not high maintenance or picky people. The service was terrible. It took an extremely long time to get anything - bread, orders taken, food to come out. The Cesar salad was such a fail! Limp lettuce and watery dressing. Who fails on Cesar salad?! Other food was subpar. Overall I felt it was a waste of time and money. We will never eat here again."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding and so was the service, they have two waiters waiting on you.  Great ambiance!  I would give it 5 stars but VERY expensive.  Dinner for 4 was a little over $300, that did include the tip."}
{"text":"Review for the bar only: The atmosphere is great, dark, eclectic and relaxed.   The service is definitely lacking. I asked for a cocktail on the specialty list and was told that the bartender did not make those?? Ummm, its on your menu??? Took a log time to get a second drink and the bill when the bar was not at all full.   To his credit, the bartender gave us a free round bc he did not have enough wine to complete the order and we had to go to our show. But I also felt like he just wanted to give me the half glass and have us leave.   Overall did not meet my expectations."}
