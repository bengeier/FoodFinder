{"text":"Tried out this new location, and wow! Amazing. I will be back for sure! Everyone is so friendly and service is spot on. Our meal was delicious and the music was great. Can't wait to try more things on the menu! This place is a winner!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this location 2 stars! The lady at the front is not very welcoming! We came on a Monday morning it was not busy only 7 tables had people sitting at them. I asked the lady (she might be the owner she's always there) at the front if we could sit in one of the booths that were open. We had 3 adults and a 2 1/2 yr old. She said no you can sit at the table that's a half booth on the wall. I tried to explain I have a young child a booth is easier to contain her. I didn't want my daughter to be crawling all over people next to us! She said no and sat us at the half booth. Then she promptly sat a party of 2 in the booth I asked for right after seating us. 

Then they have these fake little trees on the table and my daughter was looking at it.  Now granted my daughter at one point was poking it with a fork which I missed because I was looking at the menu.  The same lady came over and ripped out of my daughters hand and said \" I'll take that!!! \". My daughter was so upset it made for a miserable time.  I wasn't going to let my daughter ruin a $5.00 fake tree from Michaels!!! 

Food at this location is lacking! The Gainey location is much better!! The only nice thing I can say about this location is the servers are always great and so are the mimosas!!

My point of this review is if you have small children don't go to this location and if you want better food food go to the Gainey Ranch location!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!! Everybody that works there is extremely nice, especially the owners and the bartender!! I drove 35 minutes just to get there and would have driven an hour if I had to, this food is amazing!! Best breakfast I've had in a really long time!! Will definitely be coming back over and over!! Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Really good food and fun atmosphere but on the weekends they have a live DJ and it is impossible to hear the person you are eating with.  I went with a group of friends and we wanted to catch up since we hadn't seen each other in a long time.  We could not hear each other at all with the DJ and it ruined the experience.  I just wish they would play music instead of having a DJ.  I can see the need in a bar district but this is in North Scottsdale in a family restaurant.  I would go here way more often on the weekends but I can't risk not hearing the person sitting at my table.  If you are going for more of a bar hangout on the weekend then you will like if you are trying to catch up with family and friends I would say pick another place."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a nice brunch with friends or family. Their hash is definitely a spin to your average morning meal, but definitely worth it. Their service is also exceptional. The hostess that greeted us at the door and took us to our table was so nice and engaging! Something memorable and a true token of being a great host."}
{"text":"Outstanding service, make your own bloody mary bar is way cool, large food portions, neat breakfast experience."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant!!  It had great ambiance, the service was impeccable, the staff friendly and organized, and of course, the food was phenomenal!!  This was my first time in, and I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Wow, Corned Beef Fried Rice and the Waffle Tacos to die for!!!! We came in for \"Hash Weekends\". What a fun place to day drink. TURNTABLES + MIMOSAS + Bloody Mary Bar. What more can you ask for!"}
{"text":"Not even sure where to start. We were told it would be 20 minutes to get seated, 45 minutes later we were seated. Then we waited an hour for our food, which was mediocre at best. If we are going to wait that long we will go to Butters, their food is amazing. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Marcus was the best server! He was very accommodating, great suggestions, and made sure that we had a good time. Phenomenal food too!"}
{"text":"Not enough help; they do not serve \"good old fashioned corn beef hash\" !
You can get it with \"swiss cheese\"  or with \"zucchini\"  yuk!"}
{"text":"Just went for breakfast at this new place in town. The menu options are ridiculous- so many choices and not your usual omelette or pancakes. I had the breakfast lasagna - which was very different and quite good. My daughter had the corned beef fried rice - which was good and again very different for a breakfast menu.

The inside didn't have much character or ambience but the service was good and food was tasty."}
{"text":"Trifecta-  great food, great service, and unique atmosphere...i.e. awesome idea for the build your own bloody mary bar.  Would go back in a heartbeat ...wanted to try so many more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Hey just enjoyed a great breakfast at Hash Kitchen but even better my waiter, Gino was awesome! This place is a must for casual dining with sophisticated cuisine."}
{"text":"We just had an AMAZING breakfast here. Our server, Holden, was so personable and gave us the best recommendations for food and drinks. We have two small kids, 5 and 2 and there were so many options for food. I recommend the donut holes that you can inject Nutella into. So much fun for the kids! I had the made in house ravioli with a sage butter sauce...Ummm is this breakfast, because I felt like I was at Greenhouse or North. My hubs had a Bloody Mary (you can make your own, but I really suggest you ask Holden about options) that he loved with celery infused vodka and bacon salt. The service is also AMAZING with a woman (didn't catch her name) that asked if the kids like to color and promptly brought back Paw Patrol pictures and crayons. Did I already say AWESOME service???? The manager also came by to make sure everything was up to par. Please try this place...don't forget to go early (before 9:30am) or you might be waiting. We can't wait to go back and try the patio."}
{"text":"Great Food .  The coconut almond French toast is amazing.  Great service from Jesus our waiter."}
{"text":"45 minute wait for Sunday brunch.
Both ordered the chicken Benedict thing.
One piece of chicken was cooked perfectly.
The other was overcooked. 
Hollandaise was basically nonexistent.
Mimosa was meh but I'm not a big mimosa fan.
Bloody mary bar was good but out of a lot of toppings.
But it was a busy Sunday afternoon. 
Great DJ stopped this from being a two.
 I wish I could give it two and a half."}
{"text":"Very disappointing!  We needed to ask for coffee refills, oatmeal served without milk, hash was subpar.  Server acted as though he wanted to be somewhere else.  Never again.  We also felt the same after one try of the fish restaurant they had before."}
{"text":"Great service! It's a nice place to get an early meal. I found the food to be moderate (the breakfast burrito I had was greasy). It is also very expensive."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, service is incredible.  Tony knows what he is talking about and did a stellar job!  Second time in, and we will be back.  Don't skip out on the bloody mary!"}
{"text":"I want to start off and say I don't post a lot, obviously. But this place deserves some props. We went on Sunday and it was packed! We had to wait but it was worth it. As soon as we sat down our server Matthew greeted us. We were a large party and usually when we go out there is a mishap. Not today. Order was perfect food came out hot and glasses were never empty. I will definitely recommend to my friends. A+ service and food."}
{"text":"The Hash Kitchen Has become one of our favorite breakfast/brunch choices.  There's a wide variety on the menu and everything we had was delicious which included the corn beef hash, the coconut and Almond French toast, and the eggs Benedict. The waitstaff was attentive and coffee was frequently refilled.  I recommend this place to many friends who always rave about it. We enjoy this place so much, we scheduled a wedding brunch there. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  This was a great addition to North Scottsdale! We were greeted by Pat, a lovely first impression friendly person.  We recognized many people who worked at other restaurants!  Friendly and welcoming with sophisticated food. !  Joey Maggiore has outdone himself.  Went in today for a day off brunch. Ruby red grapefruit mimosas started things right!  The vibe is comfortable, classy and light. They will be packed on weekends. Food is hands down awesome. Our daughter had the fluffy kids pancakes made with dark chocolate chips!  She loved it and so did hubby. I had the Pork Carnitas hash. It is unlike any before. Slow cooked sumptuous pork with egg, hash, green chili, avocado and crispy onions. A MUST order dish!  Hubby ordered leg of lamb hash. First he braises the lamb for hours. For savory breakfast lovers who rarely see lamb on the menu...swoon!  Layered also with a nice dusting crispy leeks and eggs. The cheddar biscuit was light as air. And the finale was donut cannoli with ricotta and fresh fruit. Made fresh to order, they were airy and light and divine! 
We will be back this weekend when we can linger. Vincent our server was super at explaining the menu!
Laurie and Rodney M."}
{"text":"*** Update ***
I was contacted by the owner and they wanted to make it right. I think that in itself earns them another star, simply because I am here visiting and don't have the chance to try them again. I'm updating the rating to 3/5.
*** Update ***

Again, I'm disappointed by my fellow Yelpers. The Herbed Chicken Benedict, which was highly recommended, can be described by the following:
- Crumbling dry biscuit
- Chewy, dry chicken breast
- Tasteless herbs
- Lack of seasonings

The two stars accounted for the following:
- Eggs were cooked well
- Service was great
- French toast was good"}
{"text":"The food was on point and the service was stellar. Rachel made recommendations, kept our drinks full and took care of absolutely everything! All around great experience, we will be back."}
{"text":"Just left after waiting about 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge we were sitting at a table.   A waste of time and we have even hungrier kids. People around us were being served and yet we had no server.  Off to Butters we go!"}
{"text":"First timer but now a weekly customer. The food is excellent and the service from the hostess, server and manager are the best in Scottsdale. I had the breakfast burrito and it will cover two more meals with eggs, bacon, potatoes and avocado. The feel is vibrant and the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and on it with service."}
{"text":"This place was so great. Food was exceptional. The staff were so nice !!!  Let's talk about the Bloody Mary bar. So incredible. This place is a must try. I went to the new  location on frank Lloyd Wright and Thompson peak"}
{"text":"Love it, first time here and service was great. Thank you Jesus for making us feel at home. Definitely will come again.
The booze,breakfast, and entertainment was great."}
{"text":"Awesome Bloody Mary, awesome food, and to top it off, Gino our guy who took care of us, was beyond awesome. If you haven't been here you are missing one of the premier places to eat in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The food first off was amazing, on top of the food it has a very nice environment for young people or families with a breakfast DJ aka DJ breakfast or lil sleepy. The service was excellent and wasn't too pricy for how nice it is either! I really hope this place succeeds in the future as I would love to come back and try more food at this place as it all looked really really good!"}
{"text":"The concept was great with the Bloody Mary's but the food was a little too eclectic. The Bloody Mary's themselves were a meal. Overall you will enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Polite waitstaff.  I had a salmon hash and my friend had lemon ricotta pancakes. Excellent."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED this place - the venue and atmosphere is super cute clean and elegant but not stuffy! The service was impeccable and the food was fantastic. I had the smoked salmon eggs Benedict which came in two biscuits . The salmon was actually salmon chunks not the raw traditional smoked salmon and it was grilled fresh. Definitely recommend trying this place out !"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since I live nearby, but I really didn't. The sweet potato hash I had was kind of bland and the sweet potatoes were a little soggy. I did enjoy the mimosas however, but not enough to try again."}
{"text":"Wow!  We were treated so rudely by the hostess that we will never return. It was a Sunday and 2 hostesses were working.  It was the woman with the gray hair and black and white striped top.  We came in and were not greeted nicely, but told that there was a wait unless we wanted to sit at the bar.  We were happy to wait, standing patiently and quietly, looking over the menu.  After about 15 minutes the hostess approached us and said it would be another 15 minutes at least, and was not very nice about it.  There was a table set and unoccupied since we arrived, and several others waiting to be bussed.  There are lots of places to eat in Scottsdale, and if the first person you encounter in the restaurant acts like she doesn't care if you eat there or not, my feet (and recommendations to others) will patronize other establishments."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Reasonably priced for the amount of food served. They have a Bloody Mary bar where you can build your own drink. Items are grown locally and vodka is made in house too. I had the breakfast burrito and my friends had lemon pancakes and chicken/waffles. They even brought out a dessert after to help celebrate my friend's birthday. A definite must if you're looking for an awesome breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to this restaurant.  The food was fantastic.  I got the Veggie Scramble.  The menu has a lot of options.  The restaurant is very clean, nice atmosphere and good service.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews of businesses - especially negative ones but today my husband and I had one of the most horrific experiences we have ever had and I am compelled to share this with anyone (especially the owner if he bothers to read reviews about his business or cares how his customers are treated!) who is considering dining at the Hash Kitchen.  I feel so strongly about the rude, embarrassing treatment we received from the General manager Linda and the owner, that I will be re-sharing this post on every social media outlet that I can to warn people about this restaurant!!!  In fact, this is probably the worst review of any restaurant I have EVER written!  I am 62 years old and my husband is 66.  We both travel extensively for business and in over 30 years of eating in hundreds of restaurants around the country, have NEVER been treated so rudely!


Please note this was not our first visit to this restaurant.  In fact, we live just a few blocks away and strongly believe in supporting our local businesses including this one!.  We are always very polite customers and typically grossly over tip and are not considered cheap or rude people.  This was probably our 15th visit to this restaurant and we have also referred other people to it!

The owner of the Hash Kitchen originally had another concept in this space named Cuttle Fish.  For reasons unknown, the Cuttle Fish concept never seemed to take hold and after a brief shutdown, re-opened as the Hash Kitchen.  They share the same kitchen with a little restaurant space owned by the same person, which was a hamburger restaurant and also has been re-opened as the Hogs & Hops BBQ.

So, here's how the story goes:  It is Sunday at 1:00.  The Hash Kitchen is busy but not on a wait list.  My husband and I decide to sit at the bar as we have often done.  We are given waters right away by the girl behind the bar (who we were later told is the bar back and her only job is to wash glasses) then we wait for 10 minutes before we finally get one of the bartenders to come over and take our drink order.  Ok, so this place has never been known for 5 star service but both bartenders have waited on us in the past and are are very polite and sweet girls.  When they bring us our drinks, we order our food.  Sounds ok so far right?  20 minutes later my waffle and bacon and my husbands scrambled eggs and sausage finally show up - again pretty slow - but we're not complaining!  Now this is where it gets interesting.  The young couple sitting next to us had ordered a side of pancakes but the food runner brought out a huge stack (full order) The couple said they didn't order a full stack and perhaps it was someone else's order.  The food runner says to them \"so , you don't want them?\" And they politely respond that they only wanted a side order.  The bartender comes back a few minutes later with the same stack of pancakes and apologizes for the confusion and tells them they will only be charged for a side order.  

Now this is where the fun starts:  The couple strikes up a conversation with us - telling us that they live just a few blocks away and have been to the Hash Kitchen once before but the last time they were there, the service was extremely slow.  They said it didn't bother them because they knew it would probably be that way again but that the food was good so there they were.  My husband and I agreed with their statement and said that the servers probably should be better trained and that seemed to be a fundamental problem with most of the Restaurants that have been in that location  Linda, the GM came up behind me and asked if everything was ok.  I told her everything was fine and that's when she started harassing me saying \"Then why was I talking so negatively about their restaurant and the owner?  And to stop talking  about them to their customers!\"  I said I hadn't said anything about the owner other than he was the son of Thomaso and had owned other restaurants.   I told her my only complaint was the slow service but that our bartender had been very nice to us once we had her attention.  She called me a liar and said the staff heard me bad mouthing the restaurant and the owner and I was ruining the \"Morale\" of her people!!   Then she started in on my husband with her hands on the back of his chair, leaning over his shoulder.  He told her to please take a step back and take her hands off his chair.  Her response was 'It's not your chair.  It's our chair and we are going to tell you to leave\"!!!
So we finished our meal, paid our bill and started to leave but as we were walking out the door, the owner who had been waiting for us, accosted us as we were leaving, accusing us of \"Talking smack\" about him, trash talking, and screamed at us all the way to our car!

My advice to anyone reading this is DON\"T GO THERE!!!  You can get a much better breakfast / brunch at the Twisted grove, the Vig, Butters or the Village Tavern where you will be treated with respect!"}
{"text":"Had an awesome meal!  First time there so asked Lona for a recommendation.  She said get the Carnitas Hash which were fantastic and the sweet potato and shrimp hash.  

Sat out in the sun, had a Bloody Mary and prosecco berry smash and enjoyed.  Would absolutely come again.  Great service from Lona and great food!!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast of Champions! Great food, loved the leek topping on the chicken and waffles. Bloody Mary Bar was insane, it could be a meal in itself! To top it all off, the service was wonderful, extremely friendly and welcoming. We will definitely be back over and over again!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The server was helpful with menu selections and Bonnie (whom you're likely to meet while she is livening up the place) was an amazing person and made for a great experience outside of the great food!"}
{"text":"Now this is an excellent breakfast. Great selection of delicious breakfast items. Very good service. Beautiful Bloody Mary bar.  A little pricey but what do you expect in Scottsdale. Highly recommended. Will be back on my next trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The place was clean and the staff friendly. The food however was a different story. I ordered the corned beef hash and it was awful. The potatoes were cut too large and the meat was simply cooked brisket (perhaps from the BBQ) next door. The bloody mary bar that greets you when you enter is just plain weird. The decor is sterile and unappealing. Never again unless you like surreal experiences."}
{"text":"This place is the River Palm Terrace of breakfast!!!! No one can create a more unique and delicious menu than Joey and his beautiful wife, Kristina!!!! Not to mention the amazing, beautiful servers (Kharissa, Candice, and Rachel)!!"}
{"text":"I've hosted many a Girls Brunch here on a weekend. Always fast to be seated and accommodating. Although the Bloody Mary Bar is great- I've gone for the many mimosa flavors.

The atmosphere is loud but festive with the DJ but you can still talk. Fun to sit at the Bar or get a large table.

Stand outs are the Herb Chicken Hash, Breakfast Lasagna, Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and we always start with the nutella doughnuts.

A very welcome addition to Gainey Village. !!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for brunch on Friday, June 9th. The server near the host counter ignored us even though he made eye contact a couple of times. After waiting and being helped  by Gino we were seated and waited an inordinate amount of time for service. During our wait we watched several other groups of diners experience the same issue. In fact, a family of 4 deserted their table after another group was served before them, even though they had been waiting much longer.

The saving grace of our experience was Gino. He was fantastic, pleasant, and literally ran circles around the other servers on shift. The male Manager seemed oblivious to the lackluster performance of the other servers, particularly a tallish, thin man in early 30s with black hair. There was another female Manager on site that was having to manager the male Manager to stay on top of water refills, etc.

In conclusion, the food was good and the property clean but our focus was unfortunately drawn to the disorganized and lackluster staff - other than Gino. I highly recommend Hash Kitchen ownership take a look at the crew on duty on the morning of Friday, June 9th and get rid of your slacking staff and praise Gino. I would venture to guess that he will burn out sooner rather than later in that environment and he was the best part of the experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent ! Love the Bloody Mary bar as well. 
The owner lady is super nice and friendly and everyone was great there.
The food was top notch and the menu has a lot of variety."}
{"text":"First and last time there.  Had a 930 reservation. Checked in at 915. At 1030 we asked when we would be seated. They had no record of us checking in, even though they gave us a buzzer.  We finally got seated at 11. I had ham hash. It was all fatty meat.  Disgusting.  Over priced Bloody Mary, that was not even that good."}
{"text":"Loved the Dr Art frittata. The potatoes were a little soggy and cool. Perfect coffee. Pleasant servers and staff."}
{"text":"The customer service and friendly staff make this place great, and the food makes this place spectacular!!! Bonnie greeted my family and I as if we were at her home, exceptional service!! The buttermilk pancakes were so delicious I can't wait to try the lemon ricotta pancakes! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant!!! The service is always impeccable, and the food is delicious Bonnie welcomes me there with open arms and always makes my family and I feel like we are at her home. Highly recommend The Hash Kitchen to any and everyone. It is a must stop for Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service! Bonnie and her staff Rock! Love the make your own Bloody Mary bar and dj. I enjoyed the lively atmosphere"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant in the current Best of Phoenix magazine. Easy to get to location. Friendly staff. French Press coffee was delicious. The hash was excellent. I had the chrizo and mushrooms while my wife had herb chicken with fried leeks....the eggs were poached to perfection! We will be going back to try more selections and have already told our friends to check this place out."}
{"text":"I sooo wanted to love this place as I dropped by a couple of times previous to my first visit and the wait was too long for me. The staff was fine and the atmosphere was nice but my experience was just average. The food was beige. The Bloody Mary bar was a bit over the top but fun all the same. I wish the food had a bit more freshness and flavor. I might try again someday."}
{"text":"The place was fun had a Dj playing music and vibe was cool however the food was average."}
{"text":"Rocco are waiter was the very best!!!
I yelled for him a few times. He got a kick out of it..
We enjoyed the food and drinks..."}
{"text":"Great service. Very warm in the restaurant. The only complaint I have is that the 'warm biscuit' that they serve with the meal was cold and rock hard. I had to ask for some jam to put on it and no butter was offered. Other than that, the food was excellent and came out hot. The Italian coffee is wonderful. Looked over the Bloody Mary bar and WOW, certain family members and friends are going to love it!"}
{"text":"It was good for people watching, and the food was good as well. Just a little noisy."}
{"text":"Incredible food. Amazing Bloody Mary bar. But most important, the customer service from Anthony was absolutely stellar. Greeted with a complimentary mimosa while we waited to be seated. Quick seating, fast service, quality food. You can tell it's family owned and they made us feel like part of the fam. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Bloody Mary bar and mimosa flights. Can't beat that! Delicious brunch and huge portions. We will definitely be back to Hash."}
{"text":"Three of us had breakfast this morning and were disappointed at best.  Service was slow and unorganized.  When we asked Server about the differences between the on-line menu and the copy given to us, he informed us that on-line menus were \"enhanced.\" Friend #1 had a waffle which came plain, uncrisp,  and without any garnishes.  Friend #2 had the veggie scramble.  All three of us commented that it looked dirty.  I had the brisket with cornbread hash.  The poached eggs were too well done, the cornbread hash was dry and too sweet.  While the two strips of brisket were acceptable, they were added on top of the skillet making them look like an after-thought.  Bottom line...service and presentation receive F's all around.  The one good feature was the floor was carpeted so the noise level was very tolerable."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch on a Saturday morning. My parents were in town visiting and we had been wanting to try this place so decided to check it out. The hostess quoted me a 30 minute wait for our party of 5 and we got seated in 5 minutes. The bloody mary bar was amazing of course, but the real credit goes to our server Christopher. It was refreshing to have great service for a change! The food was good, not the best thing we've ever eaten, but I'd probably come back and give it another shot."}
{"text":"Went to the new location since it's less than a mile from my house....disappointing at best.  The Scottsdale road location (in the Shops at see Gainey Village) blew us away, and on a Sunday afternoon no less.  We went to the new FLW store on a weekday and won't go back. 

Here are some of the low-lights:
- you know that dirty mop bucket water/old bleach smell?  Well they must have just used it to cover the floor because it was bad.
- you know how it's irritating these days when people that are supposed to be working or providing a service to you (like the grocery store cashier) are barely engaged in their work because they are busy texting...?  Well in this case it was the \"manager\" on duty that day.  Probably why it smelled like dirty bleach water in there....
- server did not know how to pronounce \"Chilaquiles\".  Enough said. 
- food that was great at gainey store was below average here.  Service too.  I know it's hard to be everywhere at once but the hands on owners need to figure it out quickly or train someone to be an extension of them to provide the same customer service at other units.  
- Decor/ambiance left a lot to be desired.  Btw...does anyone know the connection between dj's and mimosas?  Me either, and there was know dj so not sure why it's written all over the walls....?

I hope they fix the issues but I think I'll stick to Snooze for my go-to north Scottsdale bkfast fix."}
{"text":"My server was Jesus... he took excellent care of our family with children..... best place in the State fir Sunday Breakfast"}
{"text":"Great place. Had my daughters 16th bday there and the staff was fabulous! The food was great too."}
{"text":"I got the Flat Iron Steak and Corn Bread Hash, and it was the best breakfast I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this place because it's close to my house but I unfortunately don't think I will be back. Maybe the big draw of this place is the bloody mary bar, but I went for the food and was pretty disappointed. I woke up craving a biscuit, punched biscuit into Yelp and thought I would try something new and check out this place. I ordered the eggs benedict which consists of a biscuit, hollandaise, ham, and poached eggs of course. It comes with a side of hash. The hollandaise was good and the egg was cooked perfectly, unfortunately, that was not enough to earn a good review. The hash had no crisp or crunch, it was all soft potatoes, and it came with bell peppers, which is not indicated on the menu anywhere. I have a bell pepper allergy, so automatically, I could not eat more than a few bites of my hash. I'm not going to dock points for that, because to be fair, I could have asked. However, I don't really know anywhere else where bell pepper is a standard hash ingredient. If you call yourself \"The Hash Kitchen\", you should have an out of this world hash with texture and bold flavor. Then, the biscuit was sweet and dense. I had been expecting something fluffy and savory, but it was really more like a scone which was kind of strange with all of the lovely savory flavors of the benedict. To be honest, I felt like McDonald's does a better biscuit, and that's a little sad. The service was excellent and the location was adorable, but I can't justify spending the money on really sub-par food. I shouldn't be left wishing I had gone to a fast food joint instead. It's a new place, so hopefully some changes will be made. I think they could really benefit from changing their flavor profiles up a bit, many of the menu items were basically the same thing with just one small difference. Also on Saturday and Sunday they have a DJ starting at 10 AM. Maybe they didn't realize they were in a residential area, not the Old Town bar scene?  I think the restaurant just missed the mark all around, which is too bad, that complex would really benefit from a delicious breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!  The food is just freakin' fantastic and the atmosphere is fun!  The portion sizes are very generous, fresh and unique.  This is definitely worth a visit and/or drive from anywhere in the valley."}
{"text":"Decided to try this new location on a Sunday morning.  The place was packed.  The dining area was very loud, but we were lucky and willing to sit at the bar.  The menu was unusual and there were several items that caught my attention.  The bartender took our order and was very apologetic about the long wait.  He said they were short a cook.  We enjoyed the ambiance of the outdoor bar seating.  The bloody mary bar looked amazing, but we did not partake.  Not calling us to return, but might possibly try it again in the future, since it is walking distance to our house.  Otherwise, Meh"}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing. The best Bloody Mary bar I've ever soon, fantastic service. We had a party of 8 and they treated us with as much service as you would get with a party of 2. Food was delicious, and atmosphere was definitely worth coming back to. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this location two times now, both times at the bar. The first time we sat at the bar we had horrible service. The bartenders made eye contact with us when taking our order and that was it. They constantly walked right past us and never asked if we needed anything, never offered a refill or another round of drinks. We almost had to raise our hand for them to acknowledge us. Today, we returned to give it another try because the food is really good however we had the same exact experience. There were two bartenders behind the bar and both would walk by us multiple times and not acknowledge us. Our drinks were empty for at least 10 minutes and we had to flag them down in order to ask for another mimosa and water. Again, the food is great however the bartenders are not attentive at all. I did not see either of them smile one time during both visits. 

I hate to complain, I was a server for 10 years but we were truly disappointed in the service. We will not return to this location."}
{"text":"We are always looking for a good breakfast spot and are sick of the chain restaurants.  We stopped by The Hash Kitchen today and were rewarded with an outstanding breakfast.  Our waiter, Leo, was an excellent server.  Very attentive and knowledgable, but without being smothering.  I ordered a Frittata which was delicious!  The homemade biscuits are to do die for!!  My husband ordered the Corned Beef Hash and loved it.  The French press coffee was wonderful and a nice touch to the meal!!  My only recommendation would be to change the music.  I didn't care for the techno beat music.  Overall an excellent experience!!  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had a girls brunch and had pleasure of meeting Bonnie today. She is without a doubt the best asset hash kitchen has to offer. We enjoyed the time she spent with us welcoming us to hash and following up with us on our food and service. We enjoyed the Mimosa flights and the Bloody Mary and were not disappointed! Our waiter took equally as good care. The food was fabulous. We look forward to returning soon. Best corned beef hash and the veggie frittata was great!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC New Breakfast/Lunch place - great atmosphere, lots of choices & the Best Corned Beef Hash I've ever had!!!  Definitely two thumbs UP!  It will be even better when the weather permits outside dining - staff were very friendly & helpful.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"Place was good, bottomless mimosas were excellent, breakfast burrito was great and so were the pancakes.  Will be back"}
{"text":"Great service and food. The lump crab eggs benedict was delicious; it was perfectly seasoned with old bay and complimented with a side of potatoes."}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood, and this was our first time here.  All of the employees are great, and he hostess in particular is super sweet!  The ambiance is very welcoming, and they have a really fun Bloody Mary bar to tempt you, just inside the front door.  My Preggo wife couldn't decide between entrees on the super creative breakfast menu here, so we went for 3 choices, the Lump Crab Sweet Potato Hash, the Huevos Rancheros Hash and the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes... My pregnant wife's dream come true!  And all 3 were Excellent.  We'll be back, and can't wait to try one of the 20 or so other tempting items here."}
{"text":"I regularly come here . The food is always good. And the menu is awesome . It has something for everyone . For the hacklers who complain about the wait on the weekend the food it's well worth it . You will thank me later . Kaity is one of my favorite , she knows what I get every time and when I walk through the door she already knows what I'm drinking , it's ready at my table and remembers what I get meticulously. I'm a picky eater and I've never had anyone remember my order. She's very easy to talk to and makes you feel at home .This example though is to high light they remember their customers . Your not just some Joe coming in regularly and they won't acknowledge it like most of jag off places in Scottsdale . Go! I will say it again you will be happy with the service and food !"}
{"text":"Very impressed, and that isn't an easy thing to do. No dining experience is ever prefect, but this was close.  The decorations and ambience inside are very upbeat and led me to believe the process were going to be much higher than the $$ rating on yelp, but they weren't.

We were a party of six adults and two children under five.  The hostess (possibly management or owner) came over immediately to offer crayons and high chairs and chatted with us and the kids which made everyone feel right at home.  The waitress was very attentive and suggested the bloody Mary bar which four of us tried and it was well worth it. Great selection and even had a virgin option at a reduced rate for the pregnant lady in our group.  Only one person had an issue with their meal; biscuits in their biscuits and gravy were a bit doughy but we didn't complain because everything else was so good.  When the waitress was handling the checks she noticed the b&g had barely been touched so she asked if they tasted ok.  We explained the biscuits were a little undercooked and that it wasn't a big deal.  The waitress apologized and left to get the checks.  When we paid I realized they completely removed that item from the bill - without saying anything about it.  That is service like we rarely see these days.  It's obvious they really care about your experience at their establishment and they take ownership over their guests' level of satisfaction.  

I would've been excited over a small discount on the meal - it wasn't ruined because the vast majority (including another order of b&g that came out fine) of the meal came out perfect - but they insisted on making it prefect.  Bravo.  I'll be back if I'm ever in the area again!"}
{"text":"Just off the plane from Georgia and we decided to try this place!! The banana split French toast was amazing!! This is a must stop and eat!! We will be back before our trip is over!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!!!
So, just finished our meal, 2 hours later... I brought my parents and in laws here for Sunday brunch. After waiting an hour to be seated, we were then seated outside where, I believe, they forgot about us. The manager came out to ask if we needed anything, which at this point, our water glasses and coffee mugs were empty. As we're our tummys!
When we first got to the restaurant, We waited in line to get Bloody Mary's, then we were told they were running out of supplies and they could make a half one. What??!! Ok, so no Bloody's. Fine.
Moving on, we ordered our food. 45 minutes later, out comes the food. Mine was cold as was my mothers. Sorry, I know they were busy, but that's just not acceptable.
There are too many great breakfast spots in Scottsdale to return here. Never again."}
{"text":"Ok. So. Gave this place 3 tries. First time was good, second time not good and we did speak to management and they apologized. Then Tuesday for the 3rd time and breakfast was cold. I mean cmon get it together! I'm done w this place. ?"}
{"text":"My husband and I chose this place for brunch while on vacation based on the great reviews...but it was very disappointing. The service was terrible - we sat at the bar but the bartenders were more concerned about doing dishes than helping customers. The food also took a long time to arrive once ordered. For a place called hash kitchen, the hash was underwhelming - it was dry and lacked flavor. Worst of all - I ordered a virgin Bloody Mary (since I'm pregnant) and received a normal one. This is a place you can skip!"}
{"text":"Hash Kitchen is for the trendy crowd. Interesting dishes but they are mostly pushing their bar/alcohol.  
Food was fine but nothing special. 
For those who want the basic, this is not the place for you. 
Call me cheap but biscuits and gravy with 2 eggs should not be $13.   At Butters, it's only $9 and the service is much more efficient."}
{"text":"Bonnie is a dream and the food is outrageously good. Will be coming back every weekend!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing...welcoming and friendly atmosphere. If you get a chance to come here, which I highly recommend,  ask for our server Tony... not only does he know his way around the menu, he's easy going and super friendly and his suggestions were spot on! Thanks Tony...you rock! :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in with our little girl for brunch. The atmosphere is so cheery and the service was amazing. I had the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes with a side of bacon. It was all delicious! We would definitely recommend it as a must stop for anyone in the area. The Bloody Mary Bar was intriguing. Maybe next time we will give it a try!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Sunday. Service was soooooo very slow. I saw other people eat and leave before we even got our food.  They have a build your own Bloody Mary bar which is cool but the line was super long. They did offer tons of stuff to add to your drink. Our food was average at best. I heard the biscuits were delicious, mine was hard and lacked flavor."}
{"text":"We visited Hash Kitchen this week and WOW, we will be making it a regular brunch spot. The food was delicious and so many choices! The staff was superb...Chad, Bonnie and Lona welcomed us and made us feel at home. It's a definite MUST TRY. Can't wait to try the bloody marys!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and came here on a recommendation from family- it did not disappoint. Chris was a great server and always knew when to refill my coffee cup! We got the coconut crusted french toast and the carnitas hash and both were exceptional. The portions are generous and if it wasn't a Tuesday, I definitely would have also been partaking in the Bloody Mary bar or a guava mimosa :) The restaurant also felt very spacious and clean and everyone we chatted with was very welcoming and happy to provide recommendations on what to order. I highly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. This sounded like a foodie hot spot by the menu. Was looking forward to an amazing Bloody Mary and excellent breakfast from the column put out in Southwest magazine on my way to Phoenix. Bloody Mary was disappointing and food was mediocre at best. People were very friendly and accommodating!"}
{"text":"So this is our second time to Hash Kitchen Scottsdale.....the first time was amazing so we decided to come back again to celebrate another birthday.  This time although Evan our waiter was amazing the experience was not quite the same.  Our glass's smelled like either wet dog or fish and when brought to management attention we did not get the response we expected.  We did end up with not being charge for some of our meal but the manager never came back and addressed the issue.   I will say we will try a Hash kitchen but I'm not certain we'll return to this one."}
{"text":"Created a yelp just so I could review this place. My friend suggested we go here for Sunday Brunch and I had never heard of it. We got there around 9:30 and it was so cute inside. We were seated right when we walked in the door and our server, Chris, came out to fill our waters immediately. He was back within 5 minutes to take our orders and we weren't sure what to get. He recommended the Lump Crab and Sweet Potato Hash for my friend and the Coconut French Toast for me (I got it without bananas). Our food came out soo fast (maybe 10 minutes or even under) and was hot and fresh. The recommendations were on point. Chris was so nice and attentive. We're under age but the bloody mary bar looked really cool! It definitely picked up a little by the time we left and there was a wait but its so worth it. Definitely plan on coming back and bringing new people this week!"}
{"text":"Good quality breakfasts, with a lot of variety to choose from. A lot less greasy/fatty than you would expect given the types of foods they are cooking. Everyone in my party got something different, and was happy and didn't go home hungry, or overstuffed.

Drinks were excellent, especially the house bloody mary's. Going to be my go-to brunch in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Just finished breakfast at the Hash Kitchen and the whole family is raving about it. Our waiter, Chris, was fantastic and the food was absolutely delicious! The lump crab and sweet potato hash is one of the best things I've ever tried for breakfast,  but honestly everything we tried was great. The DJ (weekend mornings) was great too!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and great service. Thanks Anthony, We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but......
We went for Sunday brunch and for starters the place plays crazy loud music. The bloody Mary bar is extensive and while we didn't indulge the Mimosa flights looked great. I had juevos rancheros \"hash\" and honestly I couldn't even eat it. It was a salty mess served on soft potato cubes (menu calls them crispy), some red sauce, a crispy tortilla, and some strips of very tough unseasoned beef that was supposed to be carne asada."}
{"text":"Best bloody mary bar ever!! The young lady that was working the bloody mary bar was excellent, very helpful. The food was good, but not amazing. But nonetheless I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I was visiting Arizona for spring training and decided to take our group of six here for brunch. We didn't make a reservation so the wait was 50 minutes but they sat us in 20 minutes. The place had a great ambiance with a DJ and TV screens. I ordered the chicken and waffles which were amazing! The fried leeks were a good touch and the chicken itself was a really good. Other menu items that people in my group tried were the huevos ranchero hash, lumb crab & sweet potato hash, oreo pancakes, lemon & ricotta pancakes and crab roll. Everyone enjoyed their meals!"}
{"text":"When my family and I took our first trip to the Hash kitchen house and loved it! Albeit was very busy and was a 35min wait, it was worth it. 

When you first walk in you are greeted by the bloody Mary bar, and it looks amazing ! I will be back to try it. The decor is nice and the chairs comfortable. But the icing on the cake was the great service by our server rachael. 

Usually the servers cringe at my mother's particular requests because of her diet restrictions but she wasn't phased one bit and love that she continually checked in on us. My biggest pet peeve is a server who asks for your drink order never to reappear....so I was very pleased with her promptness. I think service says a lot about the bones of a restaurant. Now on to the food.

Absolutely delicious. Pancakes, the frittatas, and everything else we had was cooked to perfection. Also when the food arrived it was still piping hot which I love.

My only complaint would have to be the wait time and thay it can be quite noisy because of how busy they are."}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars because it is a hit or miss every time we go to this location. I would give 5 stars but every time we sit at the bar(which is 4 out 5times) we get HORRIBLE service!! When we sit in the dining room we get great service! The food is not bad! Love the mimosa flights & Bloody Mary bar! We are going to try the other location next time because we like to sit at the bar but at this location good luck on getting good service at the bar! It's a shame because we live so close to this location but we will try the other location."}
{"text":"Great food and must take a stroll through their bloody mary bar!!! - everything imaginable.  Very expensive for a small amount of bloody Mary - that would be our only gripe.  Worth going back."}
{"text":"My children and I visit Hash Kitchen on the weekends for breakfast. Most breakfast places in  Scottsdale have a 30+minute wait, but each time we come to Hash Kitchen we are seated immediately. The food is tasty and the service is spectacular. The manager (?) always greets us on our visit and chats with us to make sure everything was to our liking. The food is a bit pricy; breakfast for three including juice and coffee builds a tab of about $50-$60."}
{"text":"Wonderful customer service and great food, it was my first time here and very impressed! I loved the Guava Mimosas"}
{"text":"I wish that I'd had the great experience that other reviewers had. 

No watermelon mimosas, which was a reason we chose this place. Ordered a regular mimosa, nearly all juice and not much bigger than a shot glass. 11:30 on a Sunday, out of gravy, so no biscuits and gravy.  Quinoa just \"wasn't coming out\" so I settled for a waffle. Friend ordered a breakfast sandwich and ended up with a burger sandwich (\"bun\"made of tater tots).  She was hungry and after settling for this because of the lack of gravy, so she bit her lip and just kept it. Our server, Brian, was good, so there's that. 

Not sure I can muster the patience to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Super delicious fried chicken benny! Also very tasty coffee. The servers were the best part, though. There was one guy from NY and he was teasing some British visitors about their accent - trying to teach them how to say \"wa-tah.\"

My husband got the corned beef hash and his only complaint was that he was able to finish the whole thing :)"}
{"text":"Service was great the minute I walked in the door. The host was such a sweet and funny woman. I got the mushroom and spinach scramble which I would give it 4/5 only because I thought it was too much spinach! Our waitress was nice and service was great. They really take care of you. This was my first time going and I will definitely come back, as well as, recommend this restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary bar is amazing and don't miss the sweet potato /lump crab meat hash.   Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Jessi, Bonnie, Linda:
You guys are awesome, I enjoyed my brunch moment with my friends from out of town. I will definitely be back. The food was awesome, the mimosas are to die for. 
Overall, A+ experience!"}
{"text":"Only open a year this place is amazing. Young friendly staff. Great patios for dogs. Dog lovers inside. Fresh delicious food w abundant potions. Great find. Bonnie the hostess makes you smile as soon as you enter. She is amazing support for the wait staff"}
{"text":"Our food and service were great. We were there on a Sunday morning and it was really noisy, so it wasn't good for conversation. The staff was very friendly. I wouldn't get the Bloody Mary bar again tho, it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"When this place first opened near my house I was very excited and quickly found my favorite breakfast, lump crab / sweet potato hash. The first few times in the restaurant and ordering to go were FABULOUS.  However the quality has gone down hill significantly both in house and Togo orders.  The hash was severely undercooked. We have received the wrong order on three occasions.  I hope they pull it together.  I will give them one more try but will not throw money a way for a $20 breakfast when I can go elsewhere and get quality and consistency for more or less the same price."}
{"text":"Wow! Great breakfast! Great service. From the moment we walked in, everyone was so nice, despite being extremely busy. tm the place was jammed and they handled it well. We had to wait 30 minutes, but we didn't mind, we heard the food is fabulous. 

When we were seated, service was friendly and efficient.  Our server, Jesus, was wonderful. I had a lovely bloody Mary from the do it yourself bloody Mary bar. What an impressive assortment! I ordered the red velvet pancakes, which were decadent and divine. My hubby had the brisket hash, which he loved. I tasted his hash and it was so flavorful and delicious. We both had a French press of Italian coffee, how thoughtful to have individual, fresh  French press style coffee! Delicious. 

We were very impressed and love the atmosphere. The DJ on a Sunday morning was a cute touch and elevated the vibe of the whole place. He wasn't too loud at all, just right to have pleasant conversation. The owners were buzzing from table to table making sure everyone was enjoying their experience. What a nice couple.

I believe we just found our new regular weekend spot for early dining!"}
{"text":"Love the different kind of bfast foods. Nothing is worse then the same old eggs, bacon, taters slapped on a plate that you can get anywhere. Went back a 2nd time a couple weeks later. Will be going back to try more"}
{"text":"Kind of surprised by the great reviews
The service was nice, coffee really good. 
We got the berry pancakes and huevos rancheros 
Pancakes very normal and huevos rancheros underwhelming. 
The portions are large and filling. Totally shocked there was a 45 min wait."}
{"text":"This was my favorite breakfast/brunch place.  The food is delicious and the service is exceptional.  The owner Bonnie is always friendly and great to chat with.  Love ant of the Hashes and great Bloody Mary bar or mimosa's."}
{"text":"This is a great brunch spot for anything you are craving. I got their mimosa flight and loved the idea of a bloody mary bar even though I am not a bloody guy. I will definitely be back for brunch in the near future."}
{"text":"Fantastic find in Scottsdale.  Food is incredible. Huge portions and so much to choose from.  Very refreshing to have some variety to pick from and not just the usual breakfast menu.  Great Bloody Mary bar and very innovative cocktails.  Service was fantastic and one of the owners, Bonnie clearly has a real love for what she is doing.  She greeted us when we came in, is pitching in with everything from moving tables around to bringing food out.  She made us feel so welcome and her love of what she's doing spills over to the staff who also seem to love their job. Highly recommend this place.  We will be back very soon!  P.S. Bonnie we loved your sparkly red dress.  You looked fabulous"}
{"text":"Best service in the valley by leaps and bounds.  The Food is very good as well.  Granted I am a New Yorker with obnoxiously high standards, but having lived in Phoenix for the last 2 years I have had to adapt and evolve to the disgustingly poor expectation and execution of service in restaurants and bars in Phoenix.  However The Hash blows away the competition, hands down superb service!!!! 5 Stars!!!!"}
{"text":"No stars! Booked this restaurant 3 weeks ago for Mother's Day Brunch. Came today and they obviously have no regard for reservations as there were people waiting in the heat over an hour . Finally after waiting 45 with no end in sight we left. Horrible way to run a business. If you can't handle that crowd don't take reservations just tell your patrons first come first serve so everyone is prepared ."}
{"text":"Great food!! The Bloody Mary bar is phenomenal!!!! Amazing ingredients - traditional ingredients & others that I would have never thought to put in a Bloody Mary, but they worked well!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down my new favorite breakfast spot! Besides an amazing menu the have an awesome Bloody Mary DIY bar filled with any and everything you could want in a bloody! Service was prompt and friendly and as a first timer our server Ashley had a great working knowledge of the menu and made great recommendations! She also noticed that my dish (Pulled Pork Beni) came out wrong and immediately sent it back to get fixed and as an apology from the chef they sent us out fresh homemade doughnuts on the house! Once I had my meal my boyfriend and I dug in and left pleasantly full and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food & amazing service!! Diane checked in on us and our waiter gave great suggestions - GET THE CARNITAS HASH!! Highly recommended for breakfast :)"}
{"text":"Made a reservation and still had an hour wait. Ended up leaving because too crowded and music was way too loud. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Have tried three times. Service always very friendly, but food really average and coffee service slow for refills. The decor is confused and even when the place is full seems to lack ambience. I wish the food was above average diner food because good breakfast are few and far between in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Chris is absolutely amazing. We were visiting from out of town and Chris made us feel right at home! We came on a Friday and we fell in love with Chris so much that we came back on Sunday. It was packed but Chris got us drinks and Breakfast Popsicles while we waited! The food is so good but Chris made us want to come back again and again! Thanks bro, you rock! The Hash Kitchen is lucky to have you!"}
{"text":"Had the banana split French toast and it was fantastic if you like bananas and sweet. Gino was sweet too. We've been waiting to try the Frank Lloyd wright location and it didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in North Scottsdale! I was reluctant to try and this place being in a grocery store parking lot..But, OMG am I glad I did.. The food is amazing & the staff is nothing short of accommodating and friendly"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of this place.  Found it on yelp and i was surprised that this place was not more busy when I had arrived.  It apparently used to be Cuttlefish, but the inside was very modern with white marble and the staff was very friendly.  My lady and I sat at the bar and was pleased to see there was a DJ there (keep in mind this was at 11am in the morning).  The DJ created a very nice atmosphere and again I was just surprised there was no insane wait for brunch like I feel like all of Scottsdale always is.  The bartender was very friendly and was outgoing and struck up a conversation with us throughout the whole meal.  I got the Chicken & Waffles which were fantastic.  They were topped with fried leeks.  My girlfriend got the chicken hash which was absolutely fantastic.  I think first off the think you'll notice is that they use boneless chicken which makes for the perfect chicken-to-waffle ratio.  Also they make in-house biscuits which are  delicious!  Selfishly I hope they don't get TOO big b/c I don't want to have to wait for great food, but I guess it's hard to keep a lid on something this great!  Definitely wanting to try again!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! The service is great. Everyone is so friendly. Live music sets a chill atmosphere. The food is delicious. The bloody Mary bar is a great touch. Love,love, love."}
{"text":"Very good food and service..no wonder they are packed on weekends. Their Huevos Rancheros is pretty good and pancakes are awesome too. Will keep going back for more.."}
{"text":"Coming in from out of town and this is a great breakfast and brunch spot. HIGHLY recommend sitting at the bar. Lona was amazing and the vibes were so awesome. People and staff were so friendly and conversational! Will definitely come back next visit!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast,  breakfast burrito, biscuits, bacon,  pancakes were very good, with some cool items like the chilequiles, although the egg breakfast for 9 year old was not enough food, but by far the worst was the music.  I think the owners wanted it to be a hip-hop dance club vs a restaurant and far too loud which was surprising since it was in a wealthy neighborhood.   Most wealthy people I know prefer their loud hip-hop nusic to stay in the clubs or a ball game, but not at a nice restaurant.   Unfortunately,  we wont be back simply because of the music."}
{"text":"I had the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were delicious. Also, the French Press Coffee is outstanding. The restaurant is very nice inside and service was excellent. The bathroom was very clean. All five of us loved our meal. One of the girls had a side of fruit and said it was the best side of fruit she ever had and ate every piece which she normally doesn't. Our server Chris was very personable and told us they can handle private parties there and customize the menu to what you want and your budget. He brought us fresh hot cinnamon donuts. It was a very nice treat. We will be going back."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a great brunch restaurant with a good Bloody Mary for a while now and I definitely think we've found it! 
My husband, our 1 year old son, myself and our best friends with their 2 small children all went there around 11 am on Sunday. The wait was long, but it was expected! The AMAZING Bloody Mary bar definitely makes the wait worth it! Our buzzer went off and they must have forgotten we had the kids because the table they offered us was a high top and we needed high chairs but everyone worked so well to accommodate our party and make it work! Bonnie was so great to make sure the kids were all ready and settled and that we were all comfortable in our new table!

The ambiance was amazing and the d.j on Sunday was so much fun!

That same girlfriend and I just went back for lunch today and the experience was just as great, and the Bloody Mary's were just as good! ;)

Both times we have been there the service was great, the food was better, and Bonnie was there with a smile on her face, dressed to the nines, and making our experience so perfect!

We will definitely be back to our new favorite brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing Bloody Mary bar.  Tasty menu.  All the Scottsdale \"beautiful people\" you can stomach. And an hour and a half wait."}
{"text":"This is one of those restraunts you see on Dinners, Drive In's, and Dives and say I wish we had a restaurant like that to go to.  The food is great, the atmosphere is fun, and the Mimosa's are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Had the caprese Benedict and it was DELICIOUS. Pesto goodness. Our server Jen was attentive and really sweet. She made our breakfast the best breakfast we've had in a long long time - she asked if I wanted a coffee refill 4 times during our meal, which, for someone who drinks coffee like water, was stellar. Definitely will be back here - next on my list is the Nutella and banana French toast..."}
{"text":"Chris was our server & awesome guy! And even better food.  Very swanky place with amazing customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy this place! First because it's super convenient location and my work . Luv the vibe with a DJ on the weekend. Huge N impressive Bloody Mary Bar. Starting with the Hash Monkey (The Funky Monkey Bread) They have some great spins on your traditional breakfast. They have great servers and most with that East Coast Feel!"}
{"text":"The Hash Kitchen is such a fun place to be! With a Bloody Mary bar and a wide menu selection there is something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Breakfast or Brunch, whatever time you decide to give this delightful place a try, you won't be disappointed.  I was sad not to be able to take advantage of the Bloody Mary bar, but having over indulged in alcohol the night before, I just didn't feel like I could do the experience justice. 
I did order the chicken fried chicken Benedict with the hollandaise on the side. I later requested a side of the sausage gravy instead and that felt and tasted a little more like my southern roots.  Very large portions and very good.  Come hungry!  
The staff were all friendly and the owner a true entertainer and ultimate hostess!!"}
{"text":"Best Sunday brunch..... Delicious food and a DJ [Craig], who played great music! I will be there next Sunday!"}
{"text":"Great environment. Awesome food. The hostess, Amy, was so welcoming and sweet. Our server, Vincent, was also amazing and very helpful with everything that we needed. Took full advantage of the Bloody Mary Bar and also the flight of mimosas and could not have been more pleased. First timers and we will be back every weekend!"}
{"text":"I am very impressed by this brunch spot that is centrally located in Scottsdale (literally). As a North Scottsdale resident and someone who is really familiar with brunch after living in Southern California, it's really refreshing to have The Hash Kitchen nearby with a creative menu including endless delicious options with a social atmosphere. As a twenty something professional, The Hash Kitchen is a great restaurant for business meetings but is also the ideal space to gather with friends for a weekend brunch gathering with the DJ and morning cocktail options.

I highly recommend the Lump Crab and Sweet Potato Hash for a savory dish and the Encrusted Coconut and Almond French Toast for a sweet option. The service is top notch and our server was always on top of our orders and coffee refills/beverages.

If you're a foodie or a brunch enthusiast, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast with my visiting from out of town sister around Thanksgiving.  As soon as we walked in, we saw the DJ and cringed.  We had walked there and we discussed dealing with the loud, blaring music or walking home to get the car and go elsewhere.  In the end, we decided to request an outdoor table.  We were told it would be around 30 minutes. No problem.  About 20 minutes later our buzzer goes off and we go in, only to realize she is going to seat us near the back of the restaurant.  I stopped her and said, no, we want to sit outside.  We got another buzzer and waited again. Second time it went off, we did get our outside table.

We sampled a bunch of things. I have no complaints about food or service after the table mix up, but I told my sister how disappointed I was that this great breakfast place I was excited about and could walk to was as loud as a nightclub.  When I go to breakfast, I want to chat with my companions, or read if I'm by myself.  I don't want to have to shout to be heard over thumping EDM.

I haven't been back and won't be unless the DJ goes."}
{"text":"Must visit Bonnie, peeps. She is the essence of Hash Kitchen! The food is fabulous - bloody mary bar, mimosa flights, live DJ - really can't find much that's comparable."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious! The lemon ricotta pancakes were amazing. Amy and Jen were wonderful!"}
{"text":"Primitive place they do not even have bottled water... seriously...???...in Gainey Village in Scottsdale...???...it is a glorified IHOP with even worse service...servers are completely clueless"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I thought I'd try their breakfast.  I'm so happy that I did. I had the Nutella and banana French toast along with a side of their potatoes.  I highly recommend both.  The French toast 4 big slices of bread with Nutella and bananas in the middle. The portion was a good size. The potatoes had carmelized chopped onions and red peppers. They were delicious. 

The service was good and the food was more than I expected. I'm happy I gave this place a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We had the chilaquiles and honestly they were the best. This is really one of the best breakfast joints here in Scottsdale, and we've tried a lot. The mimosas were delicious too, and service was great. Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place for the first time. The hostess encouraged us to seat at the bar since the wait time was less. What she didn't share with us was you get no service. We sat there looking at the two ladies behind the bar and they were so busy with the cash register that after ten minutes of waiting no with not even a simple acknowledgement by the staff, we decide to move on to another breakfast place. Not organized and no service."}
{"text":"My family and I are frequent customers of Hash Kitchen we go back and forth from the Scottsdale Road and the FLW location.  Sunday the hostess (Diane) once again was the most rude and obnoxious person ever.  I witness it all the time and wonder how she still has a job, but this was the last call for my family and I. I have a service dog(which the patio is a dog friendly patio) and she came outside and yelled and made such a scene saying \"that my dog was on the furniture.  She was in her carrying bag that she always is in NOT touching the furniture.  
She is a SERVICE DOG! My family and I were already annoyed that they put us near a table of 6 drunk women that were loud and cursing when I have a 6 year old child.  I think your management should worry more about the amount of alcohol they were serving the table behind us that they were so drunk when one of the women got up she almost fell down. 
Even the table that sat down on the other side of me almost left because of the way they were treated and asked us if there was another breakfast place besides this one in the area, we told them about Snooze which they never heard of.   
 I am sorry to say that my family and I will NEVER come back to this location, we really enjoy your servers and bartenders.  I live walking distance to Snooze but we liked the bloody mary bar at Hash, but the way I see that Diane treats your customers this is something I can live without.  I do think she is a cranky old lady and that she cannot handle her job anymore.  Something to rethink before you continue to lose more customers."}
{"text":"I was really wanting this place to be fantastic...but it wasn't. To start, we had to wait at least 30 minutes to be seated because they don't usually have seating for 6 people. Apparently they only cater to parties of 4 or less. Once seated it took another ten minutes for a waitress to come over and take drink orders. Then another 15 minutes to come over for our breakfast order. Then at least another 35 minutes to get our food. The restaurant was only 1/2 full. Once our food arrived, water glasses were not regularly filled, no one asked if we wanted another overpriced mimosa, or a coffee refill. After asking what happened to our food, a manager buzzed by asking if everything was okay, but not in a way that seemed to indicate he actually cared what our answer might be. The food was okay. Highlights were the chicken and waffle, and the yogurt parfait. The almond and coconut covered Frenzy ch toast was tasty but came with some nasty bananas. The Belgian waffles were pretuty heavy. The corn beef hash was not worth going back for. The sides of hash browns not that thrilling, either. So, they did a nice job renovating the place but it will not be there that long with such uneven service and fairly mediocre food. The Bloody Mary bar looked pretty great, but I don't think a restaraunt can really depend on that to keep the customers coming back."}
{"text":"Food way over price. Small cup of orange juice nearly 6 dollars. Employees in disarray. Called up to be seated but the table still wasnt cleaned so stood by poor hostess that was beening micromanaged by older woman. Finally got seated table still was filthy. Then over heard older woman ranting to customer about going to jail for beating up a farmer because shes some nutty PETA supporter which is weird, because she doesnt come across as one. Server was trash ... All around bad place to eat besides nice location."}
{"text":"Quality food but you can usually can expect slower service from this place and thats what turns me off from coming here on the regular for breakfast. They do have a lot of perks like their build your own bloody mary bar (not a fan but still attractive feature). Their mimosa float is bomb but it will probably take awhile to get to your table. The owners are kind, attentive, and seem to really care about the business which is nice to see."}
{"text":"I must preface this review with the fact that I am from Texas (extreme hospitality - Think Emily Post) and have worked in the service industry - I am not easily impressed. 

I called the morning of to make reservations for 20 for 5 hours later. My error, wholly and completely. I accept that. Luckily, I reached Linda. She was incredibly accomodating despite my lack of planning. She was transparent in setting expectations that another party had reservations 30 minutes after ours and they are still obligated to meet those prior reservations. I completely understood, but again, great business practice. 

Once we arrived, Linda greeted me with hugs and birthday wishes. There was a mishap with my drink and before I could say anything, my server sweetly swooped it up and Linda promptly brought a fresh one, again with apology (and some birthday appetizers). Not needed - but definitely apreciated.

The food was phenomenal. Thankfully, our group was okay with sharing each other's plates bc there was not one thing ordered that wasn't excellent. 

Thank you to Linda, our server (my apologies for not grabbing your name) and the staff who all made my 30th brunch memorable. You offered me the Southern Hospitality I'm used to and rarely find in AZ. We won't hesitate to come back (with better planning on our end)."}
{"text":"This is a cute place, with a lot of novelty appeal, great to try once but not worth the long wait and slow service to go back a second time."}
{"text":"I'm torn in writing my review because the food isn't good, but the bloody mary bar is nothing short of fantastic. 

My first visit to the Hash Kitchen, I had an omelet and was very underwhelmed. The potatoes accompanying it seemed soggy and the omelet was mediocre at best. However, I eyed the bloody mary bar while I was there and decided I needed to come back. I went back again and tried the bloody mary bar and ordered a specialized egg benedict. The bloody mary bar is amazing, they had everything from olives to beef jerky to meet balls to put in your drink. It was so much fun and delicious! I would 100% come back again for a drink. That being said, my eggs benedict was even worse than my omelet. The eggs came out hard boiled, not poached, with the same gross potatoes and way too much sauce. The lox on my benedict was fishy and I couldn't even swallow it. 

At the end of the day, come here for a drink before breakfast, but don't come here just for breakfast."}
{"text":"Tried Hash Kitchen for the first time today and it was great! Had the biscuits and gravy and the tamale cakes from Gino's recommendations. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch and it was easily in my top 5 breakfast joints. The Bloody Mary bar is absolutely amazing. Jess served us and did a phenomenal job. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The expectations were set pretty high for this place but alas, it failed to live up to the hype. My huevas rancheros were mostly diced potatoes and chili powder. They did make a decent latte, so there is that..."}
{"text":"I love this place! The bloody marry bar great, I do prefer the one off scottsdale Rd. In general but this one is pretty great. The staff was very friendly and our server Jesus was just grand. He was friendly, quick, and over all had a great energy. I really enjoy the atmosphere here and plan on coming back for many Sundays!"}
{"text":"What a fun place to visit on vacation!   If it were closer, I would be there all the time! 3 people in our group had the Bloody Mary bar and it was so fun to see their creations!  I had the blueberry mimosa (x2 because it was the best ever). Our food was very good. The Bloody Mary's were pretty filling and so a couple people split their food.  The hostess was very sweet.  The service was speedy and attentive. The music was not too loud. We were able to watch Iowa State football as well."}
{"text":"Came here for my daughter's birthday. Best breakfast in town, it even has a Bloody Mary bar! Jesus was awesome, ask for him every time."}
{"text":"Love the mimosa flight and the various \"hash\" options--one of our favorite breakfast spots. If you come on a Saturday be prepared for a little wait. :)"}
{"text":"First time here. Gino was great. Helped us with the menu selections and hooked us up with delicious French press coffee. Frittata and corned beef hash we're really good. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Why must creativity trump execution excellence?  The menu reads well, but taste is disappointing.  The location had me doubtful, as the former cuttlefish was pretty slow and sad.  To my surprise this place was pretty happening, perhaps if food which is priority to a restaurant was made well, it can truly succeed.  Service wasn't all that either..  had high hopes as it seemed to get high marks."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on our anniversary weekend. Gino was great! Super helpful and friendly...even hooked us up with some cannoli donuts with candles for our anniversary! Food came out quick and was delicious. Will definitely go back every year to celebrate and probably more often than that cuz it was just that good."}
{"text":"Food was great!! The Hashes are huge and delicious!! Gino was awesome and hilarious! Hope he is our server every time!!  French press coffee from a breakfast restaurant..finally!! Hope to see you all on the west side soon!!"}
{"text":"Great place. Chris and Rachel were very friendly and welcoming. The food was awesome, I got the American scramble and a pancake for my son. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Have had a Saturday morning breakfast here about five or six times over as many months. Service has been great, never an empty coffee cup and rarely a hiccup in the kitchen with missed orders or bad execution.  The only disappointments have been the chicken/waffles due the use of rather bland chicken breast and times when the dice potato in the hashes are under and way al dente for a breakfast.  We have also asked about the morning DJ sound level and were told that he has final say on the knob setting. The work around is to dine earlier in the morning.  Really like the fact that the menu changes slightly nearly every month, with a new dish or two appearing, while some other items get dropped off.  Put something other than chicken breasts on those dishes and I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"The hash kitchen is so good and the owners are really nice. The owners of the hash kitchen also bought my house! The breakfast there is 10/10 
I would go there all day everyday"}
{"text":"Wow, wanted to go here for several months. Suggest to get there by 9am on Sunday to avoid crowds. Bloody Mary bar is one of the best. The food portion are large, go on empty stomach and be prepared to take home leftovers. Service is excellent. Owners have great reputation in the valley and this adds to their quality restaurants."}
{"text":"I ordered the Corned Beef Hash and was very pleased. Portions were very generous. I could only finish half, and took the leftovers home for a snack later:)  My husband ordered the Smoked Salmon Benedict.  He was disappointed it was cold, even the side of hash potatoes."}
{"text":"We have been visiting from Ohio approximately 5 or 6 times a year for 25 years and always enjoy trying new restaurants. We've eaten at Hash Kitchen several times for brunch and are never disappointed! The breakfast lasagna is awesome! I've tried the flights of mimosas that are different each time and others in our group love the Bloody Mary bar and extensive array of things to add into your drink."}
{"text":"Awesome Food, Bloody Mary Bar and DJ Craig was Killer! It is a Sunday Funday favorite!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, unique, and trendy, but it can be a little expensive! They have $3 mimosas during the week days, though it can get crowded fast on weekends and holidays! The menu is different than most places and you can find something for everyone! The first time I visited I had the breakfast bruschetta, it was tasty and definitely different! Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Welcoming fresh place with interesting menu!  I was torn between multiple menu items, so when in doubt I go with signature dishes.  They had plenty of types of hashes on menu, and when the sweet waitress said I could get scrambled eggs with the carnitas hash I was sold.  My standards for scrambled eggs is very high, and these were the best I ever had in a restaurant: creamy, perfect texture. The delicious combination of ingredients in my piping hot skillet was heavy on the potatoes, but they were diced and cooked perfectly,  I wished for a bit more red and green peppers, but the three kinds of hot sauce brought to my table gave it the zip I craved.  Pork carnitas, scrambled eggs, potatoes, Cojita cheese, peppers, crisp onion straws and yummy avocado with a side of corn tortillas was such an inspired dish that checked all my boxes yesterday that I am curious to try more of their menu.  Service was so very fast and excellent, and the atmosphere and seating was perfect."}
{"text":"Went here with my dad during the week to do lunch. The food is not bad, but the music was horrible! They brought in a dj and it was so loud! They played music that should be in a club, not in a restaurant and not that loud. You have families with kids who had to listen to vulgar lyrics and you had to yell to be heard. What was a packed place, emptied out quickly and for good reason. It seemed we couldn't get out soon enough because we couldn't get our check due to everyone else trying to leave. I hope that was a one off incident. Overall, the place is clean and the food is good. I'd say it's a little pricy, but it's not a low end diner and you get quality so, you get what you pay for. I'd be willing to try this place again, but I'm in no rush.

I lowered my review from a three to a one because I don't like the fact that after writing this review, I got contacted by the restaurant to talk about my experience with the GM. Well, there was no follow up with the GM or any manager. The worst thing to me is having a bad experience somewhere and the only time a company will try to make it better is by acknowledging only the bad! Why not praise the positive reviews and thank those that had a good time, taking the time to write it out instead of just
 b%$tching. Sorry to be vulgar. I just wonder why this restaurant focused on the bad and only pretended they made an effort after I wrote the first review? So others who read this will think you actually did something when you did nothing? Maybe, but either way, I've decided this is a no return place for me."}
{"text":"I went to Hash Kitchen after hearing a ton a buzz and it lived up to the hype! My favorite thing, although it was hard to narrow down, was the Coconut Almond Encrusted French Toast. Seriously so incredibly tasty and exactly how I dream of breakfast. The Carnitas Hash is also worth a mention because the flavors are a heavenly combination. For those who love an EPIC Bloody Mary Bar, the Hash Kitchen has one of the best in the Valley. Love Chef Joey and his wife Christina who pour their heart and soul into the dream restaurant. Best Brunch: Check Great for Out of Town Guests: Check"}
{"text":"I have eaten here plenty of time.  Food is OK. It's second tier amongst the local breakfast options. It's well behind OBH and Butterfield's but it is a half step up above IHOP, although my kids still prefer IHOP

A pet peeve with Hash Kitchen is that they cannot judge a wait, or, if you call in, they flat out lie. Last time I went in, I called and asked the wait. They said no wait for a party of 4. I arrived 10 minutes later, there was a 35 min wait :(

That is irritating, especially for bleh food"}
{"text":"We were at the Hash Kitchen for Breakfast Weekend. We appreciated the deal for a fresh donut to start, mimosas and chicken and waffles, $15. The food was amazing with generous portions! Our waiter Gino gave us the best service we have ever gotten anywhere!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! from the BYOBM to every item we ordered from the menu.  Dishes are full of flavor and they are just the right amount of food to get satisfied.  The music is great and the service is exceptional! Kudos to our waitress Deanna! She was great and all her recommendations were on point.  We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty tasty ... if they did it correctly. This three star is for my lump crab sweet potato hash or should I say lack there of. Where the hell was my crab?! No crab flavor at all but I gave them the benefit of the doubt that maybe the sweet potato was cooked in crab... but after looking at other photos... yep.... my dish was definitely a crabless dish. 

On the bright side I still did enjoy the Bloody Mary bar and a bite of my boyfriends chicken and waffles wth fried leeks. He got all the ingredients in his dish ...."}
{"text":"First time here! Love this place! Lola at the bar is awesome! Adrian at the famous Bloody Mary bar was great!!! DJ played super fun music, fun atmosphere! The food was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Went today and it was great! I heard they have a Dj on the weekends which is pretty cool. The food was delicious and everyone was friendly. I had the blackened shrimp sandwich and my friend had the carnitas hash, we both recommend either dish!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Portland and found this place.  The place has a cool Bloody Mary bar and has a great vibe.  Unfortunately, the chicken and waffles failed to deliver, as the chicken was dry and was smothered with fried onion strings.  Visually they got it, but have to follow through on flavor.  Our waiter was terrific hands down though and is a good reason to give it another try."}
{"text":"Hash Kitchen amazing snacks and cocktails. The Bloody Mary bar is second to none. Amazing DJ music and dancing while there for Sunday Brunch."}
{"text":"Surprised that we didn't love this place as much as we expected to based on the reviews. We unknowingly went during restaurant week - but since we didn't realize it, we didn't ask for the restaurant week menu. Our waiter didn't mention it to us - we only realized it later when we heard others ordering from it. Maybe that left a bitter taste in our mouths - but we thought the food was ok, but not better than other brunch spots in Scottsdale. Dessert and Bloody Mary bar looked amazing - we didn't try though."}
{"text":"Four is us for a late breakfast. Everyone ordered something different and each of us loved our dishes. Service was fast and friendly. Bloody Mary bar was outstanding!  Also loved the lively music."}
{"text":"Awesome! Can't wait to return! Even though there were quite a few people waiting for a table I felt like the hostess was friendly and welcoming. It ended up being a longer wait than they initially quoted and they came over and brought us these fantastic mimosas on the house!! Loved the dj spinning the great tunes! When we were seated the waitress was great- laid back and friendly. Not stressed in anyway even though she had many tables and was super busy. I ordered the French toast and it was amazing!! An all around fantastic experience! I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"THE BEST breakfast and brunch spot in Arizona. The staff is awesome and the food was incredible. I will be back, many, many times!"}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast/brunch spot in Scottsdale. The atmosphere and decor is comfortable & fun. They have a Bloody Mary bar, which I'm sure is very popular. The coffee was bold and wonderful! I had the coconut/almond French Toast and good god was it sent from heaven! He had the lemon ricotta pancakes (which sounded scary) but was amazinggggggg!!! 

The best part was the friendly and attentive staff..service was prompt and Bonni, the hostess made us feel like old friends. She was seriously the cutest thing EVERRRRR...

To the owner, Joe...I literally cannot wait to come back this weekend to experience the weekend vibe! Great job guys!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast as usual selections are creative
and the great service starts as soon as you enter. Everyone is always friendly, and attentive. Today
our server was Gino from a little off the coast of
Italy called Brooklyn as he said. He gave us great
service and hot food which is important. Always 
busy but worth the wait will sit in Gino's section again 
and again we enjoyed him very much besides the
great great food"}
{"text":"Fun location, looking for a identity. The food and service were great, the Bloody Mary bar was fabulous. The DJ in my opinion was a little out of place but just an opinion."}
{"text":"Bonnie Bonnie Bonnie! She was the sweetest little lady. She complimented my friends and I calling us the \"beautiful table.\" We were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait which ended up only being more like 5 minutes sitting outside on the bench. Once we were seated, we all ordered the build your own bloody Mary and one of my girls ordered a vanilla cold crew infused with rum. Great atmosphere and everyone was attentive and sweet Boonie visited our table a couple times. LOVE HER! DJ was playing great music and it was packed in there. 

The food arrived shortly. We ordered Cannoli Donuts, two of the other girls ordered Carnitas Hash, one of the other girls ordered the Herb Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict, and  I ordered the Huevos Ranchero Hash. All was delicious and well prepared! I asked for a togo cold brew and they gave me a cup with ice and a jar with a mixed mama's vanilla cold brew in jar ready to go! They're awesome. I'll definitely come back again whenever I come visit Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"I love this place - so fun, beautiful space and the DJ  makes we want to stand up and shake it! LOL! Seriously, the Bloody Mary bar is to die for and there is the cute lady, Bonnie, that totally makes the party. She is so fun and if you are looking for he best brunch spot in Scottsdale, this place should top your list!!!"}
{"text":"Girlfriends took me here for birthday brunch treat. This was chosen for the fun of having to experience the Bloody Mary bar. It was a hit. It is a nice, casual place for friends' meet up over bloody mary which could be as good or weird as you want it :-) Staff was very good although food is very slow. For that latter and the food itself, giving it a 3."}
{"text":"This brunch spot is absolutely to die for! We were so excited to see a breakfast spot open up near Shea and Scottsdale. The Maggiore's did it again with this gem! We walked in and were welcomed with bright smiles and a fabulous french press full of fine Italian coffee. The experience only got better when I ordered the coconut and almond encrusted fresh toast. My mouth was in heaven. This will be our new favorite breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Awesome ambience- live dj on weekends and holidays. Make your own Bloody Mary bar and extensive menu. Food was good with decent flavor- ordered fried chicken hash and huevos rancheros Benedict with corn cake. Both a bit dry and needed sauce i.e. Green chili or hot sauce. Great service overall. Good place to start a party day drinking weekend"}
{"text":"great new addition to the neighborhood. Very creative menu items. I had huevos rancheros hash. very delicious."}
{"text":"Good food, a little pricey, but they are very generous portions. The owners are super sweet!"}
{"text":"Vincent was an awesome server. Loved the breakfast bruschetta as. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My son moved around the corner from the hash kitchen.  Had a great smoked salmon sandwhich.
Great service!  Will be back"}
{"text":"I just found this restaurant and loved it! My friends and I went there yesterday and was impressed with the food variety snd the service. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"First time here and loved it!  Great staff - had our waiter joking around with us as he was very attentive to our needs.  Various other staff (owners?) checking in on us and making sure everything was great.  Loved it!  Outdoor seating with water misters = a good time."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty. However, this is a very very loud restaurant. Not the best acoustics for a lunch where you want to actually chat with your companion. But, the menu is interesting and very tasty."}
{"text":"Hash Kitchen is a really fun brunch experience.  The bloody mary bar is a fun sight even if you aren't using it, fun to watch people create something super interesting.  They also have mimosa flights which allow you to try some different flavors.  The menu is super unique and offers a wide variety of different options.  I fell in love with the fried chicken eggs benny.  The chicken has a great blend of spices, it's not overpowered by hollandaise, and to top it off - fried leeks, surprisingly delicious.  My only reason for not giving it five stars is that sometimes the service can be hit and miss at the bar and it's a little on the pricey side.  There can definitely be a wait to get in here but it's worth it."}
{"text":"First time here and everything was good. Friendly staff with quick and attentive service. Jesus our server gave good recommendations. Really loved the ricotta lemon pancakes, spicy bloody mary and fried chicken benedict."}
{"text":"We go here often for breakast/brunch.  The crabmeat hash is SO good!  Nice big chunks of crab.  The staff has always been nice and attentive. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The good reviews of Hash Kitchen are driven mostly by its trendy concept and presentation.  The food is actually pretty bad.  To give an example, their corned beef hash was made of cubes of brisket.  You can't cut adequately cooked corned beef into perfect cubes because the meat will be too soft.  The only reason they can do this is because the brisket was under cooked leaving the connective tissue in the meat intact and the corned beef still rubbery.  If they didn't know how to prepare it properly, they were better off just using the stuff that comes in a can."}
{"text":"Great place!!!  Both food and Bloody Mary bar were the bomb!!!  Bonnie brings life to the restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fire. Hella wavy my guy. Alicia is the best server, super funny and attentive. I got the thick slice bacon and eggs and I highly recommend it. The Bloody Mary bar is a fun twist on one of our favorite drinks! BACON INFUSED VODKA! I would highly suggest you like, comment and subscribe to this place. 

No, U."}
{"text":"Visited Hash Kitchen for the first time today. It had great ratings so we had to try it. We had the smoke salmon hash and the lump crab frittata. The smoke salmon hash was very good. I expected the lump
 crab to be mixed in with the tomatoes and asparagus frittata but it was still tasty.  The lump crab was placed on top of the frittata. We also tried the mimosas, red grapefruit and guava.  Both were good, not too sweet.  The service was great and very helpful with suggestions.  Lots of good choices. We will return so we can try the other menu items."}
{"text":"I love this brunch place!!! All the food was really delicious, the service is so friendly and the overall feel of the place just screams \"fun\"!! We went on a Saturday morning around 11, and we were seated promptly. There was a DJ playing, and the music selection was great! We immediately ordered the bloody mary (I'm usually not a huge fan of bloody Mary's, however the make your own bloody mary bar seemed too good to pass up). I got the cilantro vodka and medium spicy (definitely spicy enough - would not be able to have any more spice to it). The bar had such a great selection - bacon, salami, pickled celery, asparagus, mango, eggs, and oysters. The pickled eggs were surprisingly delicious - it was the first time I had tried it. 

For food, everything we ordered was great. There were a bit too many potatoes in the huevos ranchero hash, but that's a personal issue. I'm not the biggest fan of potatoes. It was flavorful and there was plentiful. 

The service was excellent! Our waiter was extremely friendly, great with food recommendations and enjoyable small talk! I really enjoyed my experience here! Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Wow food was amazing! Peanut butter and chocolate pancakes! Like a huge Reese's cup (or Tandycake for miss you eat coast peeps!). Chris was a top notch waiter!
Wish they were open at night!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great service is awesome everybody's been very friendly food is delicious got to try it"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here during a conference and we were greeted by the kindest woman, Bonnie. After about a 30 minute wait, we were seated and ordered the corned beef hash, chicken and waffles, and the breakfast burrito. They were all delicious, especially the chicken and waffles. We also got a Bloody Mary from the blood Mary bar (the best I've ever had), and the Hash cocktail (so good!). What impressed us most was how awesome Bonnie was. She spent so much time at our table talking about sports and family and it made us feel so welcomed. It was such a great environment. Can't wait to go back the next time we are in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Found this place under best brunches in the area and let me tell you this place did not disappoint. The Bloody Mary bar is amazing and the mimosa flights even better! I decided to go with the breakfast lasagna WOW delishh and my husband had the Italian hash which he enjoyed! Service is great as well. All brunch lovers must try this out!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome... food and service!! The portions are great for the price. Really cute decor inside and out. Everyone who was working was very nice and helpful we were checked on a lot. We went on a Monday around noon. I can see how this place would be crazy on the weekend but great durning the week not packed but at least 10 other tables. Didn't have to wait long for anything. The pretty blonde hostess in the black and white dress was super sweet( I didn't get her name).Colton our server was helpful with what he liked cause everything sounded so good it was hard to pick(not a bad problem to have).Can't wait to come back and try the Bloody Mary bar. Big plus they have a dog friendly patio... (my dogs are to crazy and way to big to bring but little or just one dog might be okay not a huge space). Five stars after I try the drinks maybe."}
{"text":"A pretty neat place.. build your own Bloody Mary... flight of Mimosas ... Ula was a great server.. food was yummy as well!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was delicious!!
I got the Chilaquiles with chorizo instead of chicken and I added avocado. The avocado wasn't ripe so it was very hard. My brother ordered chicken and waffles and he said it was pretty good just the chicken was a little dry. My mom ordered the carnitas hash and that was very tasty!! I also ordered orange juice which was $5.29....the reason for the 4 stars is because it's overpriced. Almost $6 for orange juice is ridiculous and I paid extra to add avocado and it wasn't even ripe. Overall this is a very nice restaurant and it's delicious!!"}
{"text":"Love the food, atmosphere, and champagne flight. Yum!! Always crowded though, but that's to be expected for a good place."}
{"text":"Not bad, but I wonder if more hype then substance.  The hashes are mostly potatoes and onions with a little protein and a couple eggs.  Stay away from the blue crab or smoked salmon hashes, both are very fishy and dry.  Was hoping it was lox type salmon but sadly it is not.  Bloody Mary bar is cool idea, but a bit of a process just to be able to get your drink.  Was a long wait at the BMary bar.    Be prepared for LOUD environment, especially after the dj starts."}
{"text":"Yikes. Multiple strands of hair in my food. It was a veggie omelette so double gross to have hair in eggs.?Won't be visiting this place again. Come on people look at the plate before you deliver it to the table."}
{"text":"Great steak burrito. Sara our server was great in explaining the popular items on the menu.  The dr. Art frittata could be better with less goat cheese. And side order of pancakes were ok. The hash browns are really good though."}
{"text":"Hash Kitchen is our favorite brunch spot! So excited about this new location that is so close to our house. There are so many amazing choices on the menu, I try something new every time we visit. The Build your own Bloody Mary Bar even has bacon vodka. Such a great addition to the area and Bonnie the hostess is so sweet and helpful from the moment you walk through the front door. If you like Brunch, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"We would give 6 out of 5 stars if we could.  This is our new go-to brunch restaurant in the east valley.  The chicken and waffles entree is absolutely amazing. The entire staff is friendly and very quick.  We highly recommend dining here!"}
{"text":"I have found my new favorite place in Scottsdale for breakfast!!! What sets this place apart is the energy and the food quality relative to other joints in town. When I die, I would like to be buried in the hash browns here. Go here and be happy-- I am considering going back for lunch. Lol"}
{"text":"The first couple times I attempted to eat here the wait was 1.5 hours, so I was pleasantly surprised to find NO wait this morning at 10:30 a.m.  As many of the reviews stated, there is a DJ playing and a large bloody mary bar and it was a full house. However it's not overbearing, you can still have a conversation without yelling. Great vibe, lovely decor and friendly service.

My favorite dish was the fruit, it was almost too pretty to eat. Emphasis on the almost. Prices are average and food quality is high. Gotta try the mimosa flight!

tip- check in on yelp for discount on check"}
{"text":"Food was DELISH! We ordered the Chocolate Nutella donuts before our meal came. I ordered the pulled pork beni - it was fantastic. They didn't use your usual english muffin, they use their own biscuit and was made perfect. Ambiance was nice. Good place to enjoy breakfast / brunch."}
{"text":"This place has the best bacon I've ever had in my entire life it's thick and cooked exactly like it should be the food is absolutely amazing here I could handle bigger glasses when serving Mamosa's, because for what you get, I think the mimosas are a rip off...but the rest of it is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"First off, my order was forgotten and I had to wait 15 minutes after everyone else got food. Not to mention the loud music and people yelling over the music made it hard to order and talk to people. Second, their menu is so unorthodox, I was forced to eat a burger due to the fact nothing else looked appealing to me (personally not a picky eater) This burger was bland, overpowered with the taste of too much meat, only had egg and bacon on it and within a few bites I felt as if I was to puke, the remainder of my meal was French fries and water. Would not eat again."}
{"text":"This was pretty amazing all in all. Great customer service and the food was delish! I ordered the mimosa flight which was on point and my favorite has to be the kiwis. The waiter I had was Alec and he was honest and very attentive. I chose the Carnitas hash which he advise was a good choice and it definitely was. The portions were perfect for two people or atleast some leftovers. The verde sauce was a bit limey but I actually enjoyed it. Also the cutest person there has to be the manager or hostess who is a firecracker haha. Great atmosphere, very clean and great setup."}
{"text":"Delicious & a Dj for brunch. Endless mimosas & a Bloody Mary bar. I highly recommend the Croque Madame & the drinks. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"This place does not need my review, just look at the line wrapping around the building in weekends.   GREAT food, normal Scottsdale prices, a gimicky bloody mary bar that 30 somethings find amusing....   Lots of wealthy sports stars at the bar, lots of all kind of wealthy people at the bar.....  and then me of course...

Food is great, management keeps a tight reign on servers..  Dog friendly patio... what is to not like????

5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken Thai salad. You get a bunch of cabbage with maybe 3 oz of grilled chicken breast for $16. Go ahead and pass on this one"}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal! Went for brunch and the food, drinks, and service were fantastic. The dishes were all incredibly unique and happily tailored to our individual likings. The waiter even helped make suggestions I would've never thought to make, like grilled chicken with Caprese Eggs Benedict. The Bloody Mary bar was absolutely fantastic and also unique--I only wish I were in town long enough to go on a Saturday; it sounds like a real treat. Our waiter, above all, was excellent and I'd love to go back."}
{"text":"We went their excited to see the new place in town.  Food was nice.  The bartender did not tell us that there was a bloody mary bar, which you pay extra, but get additional items to put in the drink.  Disappointing.  Plus the chairs they have leave an impression on you skin, uncomfortable.  Would not go back in future."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and so unique! Love the atmosphere with the live DJ that played fun kid friendly music!"}
{"text":"Hash was amazing! Went for brunch with the chicas and Chris was the best server that we have ever had anywhere! Bloody bar rocked our world!"}
{"text":"Having come from out of state the reviews and allure of a Bloody Mary bar and mimosas grabbed our attention. The food was very tasty and the drinks held their own. However, the service left much to be desired. After waiting less than 10 minutes for a table we waited 15 minutes for a server to arrive. Another 10 minutes to get menus and waters, and another 10 before we were asked if we would like to order. Our waitress kept forgetting we were in her section and acted as if we were an inconvenience. Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Didn't even know that Cuttlefish was gone, but being a huge fan of breakfast, I'm glad we happened to notice the signage had changed. Since it's a weekday and they haven't had their grand opening yet, we were among the few patrons this morning, but everything was fantastic! The service was delightful, just the right level of attentive without  being intrusive, and the food... The food was perfect. I had the Nutella and banana French toast, when it came out I thought they had brought me plain French toast, but tucked away between those layers of bread was delicious chocolatey goodness. The hubs had a brisket hash brown skillet, he loved that there was cornbread in the dish as well as on the side. The French press coffee was a nice touch, and another day (read: not a workday) we'll be coming back for mimosas."}
{"text":"had a wonderful Sunday brunch here! the Bloody Mary bar rivals all Bloody Mary bars. So many delicious items to choose from. The mimosa flight was outstanding! I had the lemon ricotta pancakes which were the perfect combo of sweet and light. My husband had the carnitas hash and he said it was one of the best breakfasts he's had. At the end our server brought out a cannoli doughnut on the house that was amazing! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I spent $20 for the Paella Hash, it was supposed to come with shrimp and chicken and sausage but only had two little pieces of each! I am very disappointed with this place, it was freezing inside and service was very slow. I will not come back."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try hash kitchen for quite some time now after having read all of the fantastic yelp reviews. Today I finally got my chance, and I was not disappointed. Absolutely everything was fantastic. The drinks, the food, the DJ, the hostess, the server... you name it, hash kitchen outdid themselves and I am so full I can hardly move. But I can't wait to have my leftovers!!

This place was packed even at 11 on a Sunday and I had to wait about a half an hour to be seated in the restaurant at a regular table. There was no lack of entertainment or drinks while I waited though. there isn't a huge waiting area and probably not the best place for kids, IMHO, although there was one party that had 2 children there but left shortly after we were seated around 11:30. No other children were there that I saw that day.

Since it was both my friend and I's first time there, we asked our server about a few items on the menu. He recommended some great choices and was careful to tell
us which items were overly large.
 He also told us that we could order half-orders of both the pancakes and the French toast, which we both did. Even the half-orders of these were huge. We both ordered Mimosa flights and I ordered one of the signature cereal drinks as well. The Bloody Mary bar looked amazing too, but just wasn't in the mood for it that day. Drink service was a tiny bit slow, it took awhile to receive our first round of mimosas, and one of the Mimosa's was Kiwi instead of Strawberry like it said on the board, but the kiwi was fantastic! Worth every bit of the wait. Alex, our server, was super fun and spot-on with his recommendations.

The breakfast lasagna; out of this world. Never had anything like it and can't wait to have it the next time I go.  I wish they did a sampler flight of the breakfast cereal drinks (hint, hint!!) because the Fruity Pebbles was amaze-balls. But would love still to try the other two (I think Cocoa Puffs and Cinnamon Toast Crunch). Next time!!"}
{"text":"It's a brand new restaurant so they're still getting into the swing of things but I definitely loved my experience."}
{"text":"The food was so delicious we came two days in a row. Great vibes and customer service was A+. Bonnie is the greatest and makes your experience entertaining:-). If you are in the area I recommend coming for a taste bud tingling culinary experience."}
{"text":"Way over priced for what you get. Food was mediocre at best. I had the salmon Benedict which was on a soggy biscuit and my hubby had a hash that was mostly potatoes. We were very disappointed, especially when we got the bill. 2 entrees and one coffee was $38!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, slightly expensive ($$) but a great atmosphere. Serves alcohol in the AM which is a plus for those looking to booze and brunch (no unlimited mimosas/bloody marys however)!"}
{"text":"We had a weird experience here. First off, the staff doesn't seem to answer the phone, so we were unable to call ahead. The wait was 45 minutes so we walked around the shopping center for a while.

The environment inside is LOUD. If we'd known how bad it would be, we probably wouldn't have gone. I've been at concerts that hurt my ears less, but the place was packed so we figured it would be good. When we were seated on the patio, we were placed next to some very loud and increasingly drunk individuals, which was a bit irritating. The wait staff seemed totally flustered-- several different people attended to us throughout the visit.

While the food was pretty good (and so were the drinks), the fact that we waited almost an hour for the food was ridiculous. We were \"placated\" by a random woman bringing over cannoli on the house, while apologizing for the wait. I think they did this for a lot of people. Ironically, our food arrived just as she left. We were also given drinks on the house as well.

Our server was okay, a little over the top with a Pauly D personality. I would have preferred if he'd just apologized sincerely for the wait instead of bringing out food and drinks we really didn't need.

Definitely won't go back. Too expensive, too loud, and too much of a wait."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Our server, Gino, suggested Tomaso's Brunch Ravioli and it was spectacular, like nothing I've ever tasted. My mom had Cristina's Tamale Cakes and they were so delicious..the pork was super tender and flavorful. Gino took great care of us and I'll definitely be back...next time to try the Brunch Lasagna or Chilaquilies. Their menu is incredible!"}
{"text":"This place is very nice on the inside and the atmosphere is very inviting and enjoyable.  The staff for the most part is pretty friendly.  I went with a friend of mine to try something new for breakfast. From the beginning it went downhill.  My friends French press coffee was very good and I had a large orange juice that was okay.  I had a build your own scrabbler and my friend had a chicken enchilada type dish.  Both of us barely ate any of the food because it was bland and had ingredients that did not mesh well together at all.  The waiter took back our plates and didn't even ask us if anything was wrong even though most of the food was left on the plate.  The portion sizes for most of their dishes is small.  And finally we got the check and were shocked,  it was $40 for the two of us.  They charged $5.25 for a large orange juice that was barely 8oz and my scrambler was $12 for hardly any food.  If you are looking to make your own mimosa this is the place for you,  if you are looking for good breakfast this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"This is one of my FAVORITE spots for lunch/brunch. Sadly after RAVING about the crab roll and crab salad for months,  I brought my family in who were visiting from the east coast only to find out it had been REPLACED! I'm not a foodie but I LOVED this sandwich and the salad. And am so sad it's gone :(. I did try the blackened shrimp salad and it was okay, but couldn't come close to the crab... May have to reconsider my lunch I have scheduled Monday for here. That being said the staff is AWESOME here and tried to compensate for my disappointment. Staff gets 5+ stars... sadly I'm still missing my crab..."}
{"text":"Love this place. Ordered the chicken hash with no chicken...sub avocado. Veggie here!  It was to die for. The Limoncello beverage is completely refreshing and a great fix after a night on the town.."}
{"text":"Great service!! Ask for Chris super funny guy. The food was delicious!! I had the salmon Benedict that was topped with sautéed red onion and tomatoes with a fluffy biscuit and of course the classic hollandaise sauce. My boyfriend had the Black Forest ham scrambler with a side of hash house potatoes. If your looking for good food and great service this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Very good place for breakfast and lunch great service very good food I try something new almost every time I go there nice ambiance also has a bar area I've had bloody Mary's there very good,must try"}
{"text":"Loved it. Food was great. I had the crab salad and it had a huge amount of crab. We also had the Mexicana omelet. Very yummy! Our waiter was great. Met the two red head ladies on the way out--would definitely recommend and will most definitely return!"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service wasn't very good. The hostess was very young and not very friendly and when we walked in just stood there leaning on the desk, sat us inside without asking where we would like to be seated, it was super loud in there and the guy next to us was screaming extremely obnoxiously. When we asked to sit outside the hostess had a waiter come tell us to get up and wait by the hostess stand basically so that they could seat her section. No one was clearing the table so we had to ask someone who worked there walking by to do it. We finally just sat ourselves. The waiters weren't very friendly, but were just doing their job. The food was good, but the chicken and waffles I ordered were a little burnt but the Scramble that we got was amazing!"}
{"text":"The Hash Kitchen has the most amazing breakfast in The Valley. We always have a wonderful experience and the vibes are fantastic. The hostess, Bonnie really makes the place shine. She is always dressed beautifully and is such a kind, bubbly woman. We love to come see her. A must dine in scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The new Hash Kitchen is creatively designed and brings together the delectable cuisine from the original location with gorgeous new finishes. The ambiance is perfection - open air bar space, dog friendly patio, amazing coffee mug wall, and can't forget the famous Bloody Mary bar. Try the breakfast bruschetta for a delicious and fun twist on an Italian classic. A must dine for anyone in the North Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"I had visitors from Chicago, a former teaching colleague and his wife. Before we were going to venture out on a rain-filled hike, I told them they had to try a new place for breakfast. So we went to the Hash Kitchen on Frank Lloyd Wright in Scottsdale. The owner, Joey, was there so I walked over to greet him as my guests were being led to a booth. Joey was so kind as walked over to the booth with me so he could personally greet my friends!  The waiters and everyone affiliated with the HK were so polite and caring!  I ordered the \"Mexicana Scrambler\" which was very, very tasty!  Best scrambled eggs I ever had.  My friends felt the same way about their entrees.   I would give the Hash Kitchen more than 5 stars if I could!   Great place!   Great owners!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Food is delicious, ambiance is FUN, and to top it off LONA is the BEST!! A must!!"}
{"text":"In town for vacation.  Good French Press Coffee, nice scrambler, ok hash browns."}
{"text":"Linda, Bonnie and Jessie made our day!  This place was amazing for brunch and the staff made it even better."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale this past weekend for a wedding, and on our first morning in town my wife and I decided to try to find a good breakfast spot.  A little searching on Yelp! uncovered The Hash Kitchen, and we are pleased to report that the rave reviews are 100% accurate.  From start to finish the staff couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating, we were seated immediately on the outdoor patio, all questions were answered in a helpful way, and we never waited more than a few minutes for anything we needed.

Now on to the star of the show - the food.  Wifey absolutely loved her french toast as well as the perfectly crisp side order of bacon she went for.  I was indecisive with a few breakfast offerings, that is until our waitress recommended the huevos rancheros hash - i'm extremely glad that I took her advice.  This was by far one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  The combination of veggies, perfectly cooked steak, eggs & crispy onions was phenomenal, something I'll often wish I had available back in New York.

Overall this is a do not miss spot in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here on a whim, and it was one of the best breakfasts we've ever had in Scottsdale. I ordered a vegetarian frittata, my husband ordered one of the many delicious hash dishes and we were both thrilled. There was lots of food, but it was very well seasoned and the veggies were still fresh. The coffee is great, the food is great, the menu is huge, the service is fun and friendly, and we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We had an awesome breakfast. They were able to accommodate me as a vegan. I ordered the veggie scrambler without eggs. They came out with a great plate of mixed veggies and their hash browns."}
{"text":"Hash Kitchen is great. Nice location, big portions, and fantastic staff (Gino was awesome!). Not only is the food top-shelf, but the music is wonderful - lots of 90s jams. Would absolutely go back 5/5."}
{"text":"Been here several times and this place continues to be excellent. Bloody Mary bar is the best but don't overdo it with all the fixings or you are not going to be able to eat your breakfast. I have enjoyed many items on the menu but For me, Lump Crab Hash is the best. Amazing crab meat. The real shit. Great service also. And if you have room still at the end, go for one of the craft starters ... or get started with one (but share it!!)."}
{"text":"It's official, Hash Kitchen is my favorite brunch spot!  I've visited both locations and the service is stellar, the food is delicious, the drinks are heavenly, the DJ played some jams that kept us moving or talking, the vibe is insane!  A damn good time for sure!  This was second time visiting with a large group.  The staff was some accommodating both visits and very attentive to the entire group.  We never had to ask for everything.  Either the server or management were so on it with drink refills, ketchup request, jam request, anything!  They were awesome.  I can't remember our server name (a really tall, nice, soft spoken guy) but Amy and Bonnie were exceptional.  Bonnie is a hoot!  She's a really good time ... you can tell by the pictures. 

I can't remember if the other location features a Bloody Mary Bar but this one does for sure.  I don't drink Bloody Mary's but my goodness they were soooo many toppings and fixings for your Bloody Mary.  I noticed bacon strips, meatballs or sausages (Not sure), celery, carrots, cucumbers, fruit, so many things.  The fact that there were so many fixings for your Bloody Mary made me want to try it for the heck of it but I chickened out.  Next time maybe.  I really like the \"unknown\" variety of mimosas.  I'm saying unknown because you have no idea of what kind of mimosa will be featured for the day.  This past Sunday it was the classic, kiwi, blueberry and mango.  Blueberry and Mango were our favorites.  On my last visit, it was the classic, pomegranate, guava, and mango.  So, I'm sure each visit you'll get to try something new. 

It was 10 of us in my party.  We ordered a variety of dishes.  The Carnita Hash dish came highly recommended.  4 of the 10 ordered and LOVED it.  We also ordered the Blackened Shrimp Hash (looks and taste delicious), the Corned Beef Hash (a classic and my personal favorite), Veggie Scramble, Waffles, and Breakfast Cannoli (my goodness ... so damn good).  Everything, everything was tasty. 

Our reservations were for 10:30am.  I got there around 10:15 and I heard the wait was about 30 mins or so I would highly recommend reservations if possible.  We'll give it a few Sundays but we're definitely heading back to Hash Kitchen VERY soon!"}
{"text":"5 star... completely Stella! The service, the Hash, the mimosas!! My Lord the Mimosas!!! Okay, let me slow down a bit!! 

A group of us, Idk maybe 14 or so celebrated a friend's birthday just this past Sunday. We were there from 1 until closing time (3pm) and boy did we have time. The DJ (a bad ass lady ) spinning awesome tunes, the service was super quick. Unbeknown to the birthday girl and the rest of the party, almost immediately upon arrival the chef sent  her 2 loaves of complimentary sweet bread cinnamon bread or something like that. It was soooo good, such a nice gesture and totally unexpected!! 

Everyone, I mean everyone ordered the mimosa flights. $16 bucks for 4 mimosas. They were too damn good. Classic, Razz, Mango and Guava were the flavors (no substitutes there, also no problem). 

Everyone also tried every version of the hash. I personally ordered the Italian Sausage hash. It was delicious but after tasting a friend's corn beef hash I wish I would have gotten that.  Next time for sure ... and there will be a next time!!!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 35 and I think they handled our big group very well. The food was good, everyone in my group was pleased with the food and service."}
{"text":"Very poor!  The coffee was acidic and watery...like a low quality breakfast joint. My French toast looked and tasted like it had been made earlier and reheated. My husband's Corned Beef Hash was mostly potatoes and topped with over cooked poached eggs. We expected much better! A friend of mine had lunch there and she, too, was disappointed with her chicken sandwich. She said I should post that it was very dry and most likely reheated. It definitely was not made fresh. If you want to have a fun place to drink Mimosas or Bloody Mary, this might be the place. Have a few of those and you won't care what the food tastes like."}
{"text":"My wife and I and our best friends came here for breakfast expecting a really good experience and by the end of our meal it wasn't really good, it was better than good, it was FANTASTIC! First of all, Lona, provided us with top level service! She was so happy and helpful and very friendly! They have a great Bloody Mary bar with tons of vegetables & other stuff including flavor fused vodka!
Two of us ordered the carnitas hash & eggs and both of them said it was incredible. (See photos)
My buddy ordered just hash & eggs and he said it was perfectly cooked and very filling. Finally, I ordered the huevos rancheros hash. The presentation was amazing (again see photos) 
I've never had rancheros quite like this. It was stacked 6\" high with crispy fries onion rings with an unbelievable green sauce! Fantastic! 
The prices were amazing, the service was great, and the consensus of everyone in my group was that we would ALL definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Make your own Bloody Mary Bar?! Yes please!!! So many fun options to add to the mix (variety of spiciness/vodka choice too!!) So tasty! Very personalized service as well. Wait staff and management on point....makes you feel right at home with yummy food."}
{"text":"Went to this place for brunch and it was really good. The portions are pretty big and they have bottomless Mamosa's. They had live music and the place was pretty happening! I would go back and try other things and even try more cocktails. Recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was so good. A bunch of us went here for my birthday and we all got something different so we could taste a bunch of things. Everything was really good, but the service was so slow. We were there for more than 2 hours and based on the other tables it seemed like the norm."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Friday. Beautiful decor. Waitstaff was super nice and attentive. They have an amazing build your own Bloody Mary Bar and oysters. I ordered the endless mimosas. They have 5different flavor a to choose from. I had 3 of them. My friend and I split the donut appetizer. It was perfect with the cream. I ordered the chorizo hash and my friend ordered the herb chicken eggs Benedict. My chorizo hash was pretty! Came with fried onions on top.
Overall, this place was tasty! Recommend for a cute breakfast outing or a rowdy girls morning!!"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing! You can eat healthy ! Dr.Mollen Frittata is amazing! Gino is the best waiter he makes you feel like a family friend and very knowledgeable with suggestions! Bloody's and Mimosas are great!"}
{"text":"Well  where do I begin** the wait time was almost two hours  the place is definitely under staffed  we didn't receive the complimentary breads un til after our meals which no one could eat so  we were all too full  
Dirty classes  
Food was good  
A million food choices
Good music"}
{"text":"This location just opened up near where we live. We decided to try it for breakfast and was not disappointed. From the start, the staff was very friendly. Bonnie the hostess chatted with us and even let us sit where we wanted. The menu is very unique. Most things can be ordered to your liking or customized. 

I got the herb fried chicken hash and it was delicious! Geno was our waiter and was nice enough to make a suggestion for my fiancée. Not only was the food good, the service was excellent. With so many things I want to try on the menu, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was great and ambiance was cool, but overall the service was less than stellar. We waited nearly 45 minutes at the bar and were told we couldn't sit there unless we were \"dining there.\" Little did she know (I guess she was a manager, she was wearing a suit) we had already ordered drinks and starters from the bartender while we waited. The check took forever to come and then it again took forever for the server to come pick up the checks to cash out. We ended up bringing our checks to the server. 

Food was very good. I ordered the Banana and Nutella French toast and a friend ordered the crab and sweet potato hash! 

I'd recommend going, but maybe not during prime time on the weekends."}
{"text":"Omg my favorite Bloody Mary ever. And I'm kind of picky about them. Lol The service was amazing from the really hip friendly lady at the door to our super friendly server Matthew. I had the Lump crab Benedict, my sis had the chicken and waffles and cousin had the breakfast burger. 

You MUST do the Build your own Bloody Mary. IT IS OVER THE TOP GOOD. 
Also, do the chicken and waffles. Super super good. 
Will be back next trip to AZ! :)"}
{"text":"Great food (seriously is really good). However, our server was a kind of rude. She rushed through the orders and didn't have the patience to explain the items. Also, she answered the questions with just one or two words and never smiled. I'll totally come back if I wouldn't get the same server."}
{"text":"The three stars are for:
*** Creative, Amazing Bloody Mary Bar with lots and lots of add on's.  So Great for $10.
*** Variety of Menu:  You have lots to choose from.  Waffles with berries and whipped cream were delicious.  This is not a difficult dish to prepare so hard to gauge.  I found that the Hash dishes have a large amount of unseasoned cubes of potatoes usually with eggs and a meat of your choice.  If you don't mind eating an overwhelming amount of potatoes (carbs) for breakfast then you are good. 
** They had a DJ on the weekend.
** Their customer service is amazing.  If anything goes wrong they will make it right and then some."}
{"text":"Not good. I was treated like I was annoying the bartender by asking to order, or pay, etc. etc. Items were missing from my order, too."}
{"text":"Love the concept and set up. Great space and service. Overpriced for the value you get. Breakfast burrito was good. Shrimp and sweet potato hash sounds great but poor execution. The \"shredded\" sweet potatoes made it unappetizing and flavorless. Would have been better if it was kept diced."}
{"text":"Sooooo freakin yummy!!!! Great service, sat us down fast food came out fast! Jen was the best!"}
{"text":"Gimmicky bloody mary bar. Long wait. Enticing menu. Amazing pork hash w green chile, + smore french toast. Bacon potato omelet was not tasty. Live DJ at brunch playing pop hits. All in all a hit!"}
{"text":"What an amazing breakfast/brunch place!!!  Definitely a must go to for our guests!!!  Not to mention....I'm a \"hash\" anything freak, so that part is well praised!!!  But on top of that, they have the most incredible DIY Bloody Mary Bar!  Complete with Slim Jim's, bacon, salami, jerky and freshly shucked oysters!!!!  Deliciousness in a glass!  They infuse their own vodkas like:  cilantro lime, cucumber, jalapeño, orange and more!! 

Well done....Maggiore family!!!  Another jewel in the valley of the sun!!! 

Back with our friends from UK!  Well, sorry Barry, but we will bring you next time for spicy Bloody Mary....

I am remiss if I don't mention my lovely ladies of Hash Kitchen!!!  Bonnie is an amazingly beautiful inside & out greeter and all around \"go to gal\"!!!  You must visit just to meet Bonnie!  I love her & you will, also!!!  Now Linda is a tenacious, incredible detail oriented manager that has made the restaurant fine tuned!!!  I love coming for delicious food and now just to see my ladies!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food - highly recommend the mimosa flight and bloody mary bar!"}
{"text":"This is definitely going to be my new favorite brunch place!!  Everyone is so friendly, especially Bonnie!!  My department met there, and it was our first time visiting Hash Kitchen and WOW!!!. Bonnie welcomed us in with open arms. She is very delightful and very happy!! I love her, We all love her!! We ordered the cannoli donuts, brunch bruschetta, biscuit and gravy, pancakes, and of course the must have \"The Bloody Mary Bar\". We definitely tell all of our friends about this place, and we definitely will be back!!! Thank you so much Bonnie for your hospitality! And Go Buckeyes!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere! A DJ in the lobby! Bloody bar, w/Slim Jims for condiments and more! Jessie at the bar is great too!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Hash Kitchen and we will definitely be back! Everything we got was DELICIOUS. Between the three of us we got a : frittata, eggs Benedict, French toast, and carnita hash. Amazing! 

Our server, Jesus, was attentive, super nice and gave some great menu recommendations. The hostess was so sweet and even convinced my husband to sit outside (haha- still so nice out, had to take advantage of the weather) and Amy and Diana (owner and hostess) were so welcoming and made us feel right at home. (Thanks Amy for making sure my husband got French toast ) 

Best breakfast/brunch place in the neighborhood! Can't wait for round two. Thank you, Hash Kitchen!!"}
{"text":"Delightful place I found on my way to work today. And if you're going to work on Saturday you might as well go with good food in your belly. I got to go. Eggs Benedict . Yummy . I had a timeframe they made it with bells on. Hostess was delightful and  well educated Regarding the ongoing's of the family business. I found that to be refreshing. This is a must stop and eat spot!!"}
{"text":"So I've been here a couple times now. The atmosphere is awesome... for brunch they have a Dj and it's a wonderful vibe... but the food at best is ok. It's not very flavorful... I would give specific food choices but I've tried about 6 dishes and they all seem bland at best.

Bloody Mary bar is cool and the Dj is fun... go for the vibe and not the food"}
{"text":"I wasn't as impressed as I was hoping to be with all of these previous reviews. We went during Arizona Breakfast Weekend, but I chose a has dish off the regular menu. It was way high priced for the mediocre quality of the meals and service we received. I was missing parts of my meal and with all of the noise it took 5-7 minutes to get a server's attention for help.. It also took 10 minutes for someone to help us redeem the check-in discount offer! I am not normally a \"needy\" guest, but I felt like I had to be to get attention here. The only memorable part of the experience was an older woman (the owner?) dancing around to a live DJ. Very cool she's enjoying herself, but I could've used a better product and service while she danced around like a teenager at Panama City Beach spring break. She paid some attention to a few tables of regulars she knew, but quickly returned to her dance party thereafter..."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service!!! My family and I truly enjoyed our food and experience!!  They even had gluten free and vegan options! Two thumbs UP!!"}
{"text":"This place had amazing fresh and delicious food.  The only down side I would say is that it can be very noisy inside.  If you are trying to talk to anyone at your table, it can be difficult if they are not seated write next to you.  Sitting outside the noise is not a problem, and the food was great.  Pancake servings are large and easily shareable."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out while on a Business Trip in Scottsdale. Based on the reviews we gave it a shot. Well worth it with Great Service and Food. Tried the Corned Beef Hash and it was one of the Best I've had. French Press Coffee was a Nice Touch also... Would recommend to everyone in the Scottsdale Area."}
{"text":"Our server was great, the scene is fun. The food itself - huge let down, don't order biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"Went to Hash for a work meeting breakfast on a weekday. I ordered the veggie scrambler and overall liked it however I was not wildly impressed. My coworkers did order different dishes and all really loved what they had. Next time I come to Hash I'll have to try something different +plus a drink when it's not a work meeting. Overall this is a restaurant I would recommend because the staff is well trained and the ambiance is wonderful. I can't wait to try again."}
{"text":"Such a fun brunch spot! I came here for a friends birthday and we couldn't have been more taken care of! Alyssa was extremely attentive and made sure we had everything we needed to have a flawless brunch. The mimosa flight was delicious, they change the variety every flight. There was a large variety of options for my vegetarian diet and the food tasted phenomenal and was more than enough in quantity and came with additional sides. The price was reflective of the quality! I will surely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Been here twice already and it has yet to disappoint. Server (wish I could remember his name) was wonderful in recommending the Carnitas Hash to my 15yo son who usually gets Oreo/cookie whatever at breakfast restaurants. Son's was delicious- we both enjoyed it and took it home to enjoy again. I got the Smoked Salmon Frittata - good but not as delicious as son's hash skillet! 
We got here early on a Sunday and was seated right away. Place was buzzing when we left. 
I will be back (when I'm not dd) to try the Bloody Mary's. The bar has so many offerings, can make a meal out of that! 
Definitely not usual breakfast place - I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time here and we'll definitely go back. Fantastic French Press and regular coffee. My son gave his burger 5 BIG stars. I loved the house made balsamic vinaigrette dressing. My other son loved his French toast. Our server Jesus was great. We sat outside and it was really relaxing. Inside is pretty loud due to the acoustics (no music just lots of noise). The bar and the cocktails are really a sight to behold."}
{"text":"Took my boys there again after a car show. Been to the one off Scottsdale and the one over off of Frank Lloyd Wright. Amazing food and service at both locations!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch today on Monday. Little busy inside so we chose the patio. Food was great as usual but this time the service was lacking. Had to ask for everything from a clean fork to butter and jam for toast. Still love this place though!"}
{"text":"I had the best brunch at Hash Kitchen last weekend.  The BYOBM bar is the best of any I've been to; the mimosa flights were delicious, food was good...and the service (we had Alec) was INCREDIBLE!!  Highly recommend, worth every second of the wait :)"}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast place I have been to in a really long time! The service, food and drinks were outstanding! I highly recommend, great for big groups, families or just a girls brunch!"}
{"text":"Happy New Year my peeps! Make sure to grab your bestie , your boo and bring in the new year with this gem ... \"The Hash Kitchen \" I promise it won't disappoint . Mouth watering freshly made food, killer atmosphere, stellar staff of employees, fully equipped Bloody Mary Bar!  The menu has something for everyone if you go let me know! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday around 11:30.  Very lively atmosphere with a DJ, which I liked.  Unfortunately the wait was really long (over an hour).   I wouldn't mind it if we could get our name on the list before we left the house, but I called ahead and they don't allow that.  So, we had to stand outside most of that time because there is not room inside or at the bar.  Really cool Bloody Mary bar, if you are into that.   Lots of things you can add like sausage sticks, meatballs, ravioli, eggs, olives, etc.  If you prefer mimosas, they have a mimosa flight.  Good size mimosas (4 of them) for $16.  Not a bad deal since they are $6 each if bought individually.  I ordered the guava, which was very good.  For food, I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were delicious, probably best pancakes I've ever had.  I would probably order those again if I come back (that is if the wait is ever less than hour or they start taking reservations)."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and great food! I went on a Friday morning for brunch with a party of 14, and they were very accommodating and patient with our large group. Sad we did not go on a weekend when they had a live DJ, because I am sure that would have made our experience even better. Everything ordered tasted amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"We tried the hash kitchen for the first time this morning and it was great! The restaurant is very clean and well put together. Our food was fantastic and our server Gino went above and beyond with his service. Everyone was so friendly! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was great.  Amazing Bloody Mary w/ Bacon from the Bloody Mary Bar. 
Would recommend this place to anyone visiting the Scottsdale area. 
Good place if you have or don't have kids
Also Tvs if you need your sports fix"}
{"text":"Stunningly disappointing food. Namesake hash was lukewarm and appeared extruded from a can...and remarkably flavorless.  Staff was inattentive during a very slow time of day. Atmosphere was cool and not inviting. 

Nevertheless, a lot of food, albeit plain, for the price."}
{"text":"LORD THIS BREAKFAST WAS GREAT!!!!!! My only regret was not trying the bloody mary bar, that to looked super delicious. The food was incredible there was something for everyone. Bonnie (the hostess) was pure genuine hospitality!!!! When i am back in AZ this will be my first stop. We started with the donuts as an appetizer!!!! Incredible!! When the coffee is good in a place like this you know that they have thought of every detail. this is a must TRY!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I went for the first time on a Sunday.  While it was busy we still got seated rather quickly.  We had the mimosa flights and they were yummy. Guava was my fave!  The service was good but the good was better!  I ordered chicken and waffles and they ate KILLING Lo-Los.  It was delicious .  They had good music, good atmosphere and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The corn beef has is a little different here.  Unlike chunks/strips, it's almost like ground meat, without the ground texture, a bit more mushy.  The combination of the hash, potatoes and egg were great.  The hash while not super salty, was still a tad bit salty, but acceptable compared to most places.

The steel cut oatmeal was a nice and smooth consistent texture.  Great blend of brown sugar, almonds and berries all mixed together.  

Fresh squeezed OJ was good as well."}
{"text":"Jen was a great waitress.  She was attentive and did a fabulous job.  The food was ok.  The service exceptional."}
{"text":"Visiting from Nashville, TN and came to Hash Kitchen for brunch with friends, it was amazing! The service was great, the drinks and food were delicious. Had a chance to talk to a co founder, Bonnie. She was incredible, made us feel so welcomed with her lovely positive energy. I hope to eventually see Hash Kitchen in Nashville!"}
{"text":"Our friend decided to have her birthday brunch at Hash Kitchen and honestly, I had some VERY high hopes. All of my coworkers raved about it, friends loved it and needless to say I was excited. Once seated, our waiter came around for drink orders. Me and my friend both got the bloody mary bar (my favorite whenever I brunch). After receiving a ticket to go get our drinks, we then had to wait inline at the bar to receive our vodka and mixer. That wait alone, was 15 minutes. Keep in mind, this is on top of having waited for a table and then the server to return with our tickets. Any other restaurant I have been to returns with the vodka and mix and you are then able to go and garnish as you please... not here. The selection at the bloody mary bar was great except half of the items were already gone. We were there at maybe 11am so it wasn't late in the day at all. The bloody mary itself, was delicious, but our table having to wait on us to order meals didn't make much sense. I ordered the prosciutto eggs benedict - meh. I would never order it again. No flavor and the bread was hard as a rock. No one seemed overly impressed with their food - my husband got a hash skillet (Italian maybe?) and he said it was just OK. For the price, and the wait time, there are plenty of better brunch spots."}
{"text":"When are first come bar seats not really first come bar seats?  When the bartender shows favorites.  We had a bit of a wait at Hash.  The food and atmosphere are worth it.  Free mimosas while you wait is awesome.  We decided to grab bar seats after 45 minutes but a prissy bartender told us she was holding them for someone else.  Hmmmm.  So it's not open seating at the bar I guess.  I mentioned this to the owner, an incredibly hard working, entrepreneur woman and she sat us immediately at a table.  Kudos to mom for her prompt recognition of her employees error.  Good times and good food.  No thanks to a bartender who thinks she controls the bar seats.  You just cost Hash a 5 star review."}
{"text":"Our first time today ... We had a wonderful experience, and we immediately felt welcome. The food was excellent and the service was extraordinary! Every thing we ordered, from the chilaquiles to the chicken and waffles, was delicious and on point. Linda and Bonnie really took care of us today and made us feel at home.  We brought our kids and and they enjoyed their food and their time here too. We will be definitely be back and would recommend this place to anyone looking for an awesome meal and incredible eating experience! Thank you :)."}
{"text":"Two words Bloody Mary!  I felt the that the Bloody Mary bar was amazing for 10-12 dollars it was a awesome experience. Everything else was pretty average. My meal was just ok, overall I found the food lacked overall flavor, and the fried chicken eggs Benedict had super dry biscuits and the fried leeks on top were over kill. Nothing a little water couldn't fix. Next time I am in Scottsdale would love to stop by for a bloody, but would probably skip breakfast. Enjoyed the overall atmosphere mainly since I was on the far side of the restaurant away from the DJ's loud speaker. Service was good."}
{"text":"Brunch is my favorite so I'm willing to wait for a table. Most places are usually very busy in the mornings so it was no surprise that there was a 40 minute wait on a Sunday at The Hash Kitchen. It was almost exactly 40 minutes later that my friend and I got a table. We were seated in a little booth and our server came by to get our order shortly after.

I got a Mango Mimosa & the Herb Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict and my friend got the Herb Fried Chicken Hash. They were essentially the same dish put together in a different way, but the flavors were absolutely on point! I really enjoyed how crispy the fried chicken was and how well it went with the fried leeks and hollandaise sauce. The surprise was the maple reduction which enhanced/complimented all the other flavors really well!

I would definitely suggest going early or being prepared to wait for a table. If you have to wait, the good news is that they have a pretty impressive looking build your own Bloody Mary bar as well as a few different mimosa flavors to pick from ... more than I have seen at other restaurants. The food though, in my opinion, is definite worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are celebrating our 28th year anniversary in Scottsdale AZ and were deciding on where to have brunch when my husband recommended Hash Kitchen.  WOW!!  We were seated immediately where our server, Rachel, took excellent care of us.  She told us of some favorites on the menu and it was divine!!  We had coconut almond French toast and Carnitas Hash and thought we had died and gone to heaven!  The establishment was very clean and the service was excellent.  When we were just about to leave the restaurant manager approached us and asked us how everything was and we ended up having quite the conversation with Linda. She was a delight to talk to and we would highly suggest that you give the hash kitchen a try!!  Linda is a fabulous restaurant manager!! You won't be disappointed!!!  Cara Shumway"}
{"text":"Hash kitchen is great, especially the Bloody Mary bar. Lots of choices. Now the bad part, if you go Sunday morning your going to be waiting 1.5 to 2 hours for a seat, or at least 3 Bloody Marys. 

The food i thought was good. Lots of choices and some interesting things I haven't seen elsewhere. Like lots of flavors of hash.  

So if you have 4 hours to spare on a Sunday morning, or 3 hours on any other day, I'd recommend it for something a bit different."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Hash Kitchen on many occasions, both at this location and at the Scottsdale Road restaurant and my normal rating of this place would be 4 stars.  Usually the service is exemplary, unfortunately, not today.  Perhaps they were extra busy because of the Veterans Day crowd, but the service was definitely sub-par. Upon being seated and ordering our mimosas and coffee, we waited quite awhile before our drinks arrived.  When the drinks did come, they forgot my husband's mimosa.  I usually ask for no potatoes with my meal (I'm not a fan and don't like wasting food), I did the same today.  When my breakfast arrived, so did the bowl of potatoes. Our waiter didn't seem to be able to focus and it was difficult to get his attention so that we could order refills on our coffees and mimosas. It was quite awhile before he returned to our table after taking our initial order.   

Perhaps the most unnerving aspect of breakfast was the music.  When we first arrived, the music was playing quietly in the background, however, after about 10 minutes, one of the servers decided to crank the music up.  Definitely too loud for a breakfast atmosphere.  Don't get me wrong, I like music to accompany my meal, but not when it makes it difficult to have a conversation.  Luckily we were seated at a distance from the speakers, I can't imagine the experience of those patrons seated near the speakers, it must have been a nightmare. I noticed quite a few of the diners looking back at the speakers and none were smiling. 

I do like the menu offerings of this restaurant but won't be visiting the Frank Lloyd Wright location again.  I'll take my chances on the Hash Kitchen on Scottsdale Road and hope for better service and a quieter atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was interesting
But not worthy a repeat
Visit in my books;(
Decent and average at best!
Good for families
And young adults
Loud
But cute"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic but we waited over an hour when we were told the wait would be 30 minutes. They said they would comp us something for the wait but they never did. We really enjoyed the meals and our waitress was a sweetheart but the overall experience was rough. Probably will not come back."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in the way this business was ran. I had called trying to make a Mother's Day reservation (like the rest of the world) a little over a week before and they told me no reservations for my party of 3. So I expected maybe an hour ish wait when going in as a walk in. I come in to find out that it is a 3 hour wait because they decided to take reservations 3 days before the day. Working in the service industry in San Diego, I know that this is not an okay way to run a business and in the long run will actually cause reviews like this. I am unhappy and am disappointed in the unfair way that Hash runs their establishment."}
{"text":"Great place for you and your pups for breakfast. Good coffee, great mimosas and yummy menu. Added bonus for the pup parents all the staff came over to the table to say hi and snuck our pups some treats. Bonnie is awesome- super friendly and loves rescue dogs We will definitely come back ! PS the cannoli doughnuts are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Great place food and service was excellent and Bonnie is the bomb I will defiantly be back #Hashhashbaby#"}
{"text":"My sons and I love this place!! Fresh food and friendly staff all the time! Our server Alyssa is always such a joy!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a brunch party atmosphere outside of Old Town, I think The Hash Kitchen is as close as it gets.  There's a Bloody Mary bar and different flavors of Mimosas, plus a DJ that starts playing Saturday and Sundays at 10 AM.

If you're not looking for that kind of atmosphere, I would advise you go to Breakfast before 10 AM on the weekends.  

Service is good, and the food is good, too.  My wife got the Vegetable Scramble and wished there were more veggies, and I got the Smoked Sliced Brisket Hash and wished there was more brisket.  

Whatever you're looking for, I don't think you'll be disappointed with The Hash Kitchen.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Hash Kitchen in North Scottsdale for Easter brunch. I'm pretty sure it's first come first served (aka no reservations.) Knowing ahead of time how crazy busy it can get there we arrived around 9:30am and were promptly seated. The staff were kind and attentive (we had a stroller so they were accommodating with providing us extra space.) 

The food is tasty and unique. We ordered their cannoli donuts and veggie egg scramble with home fries. They have a wide selection of Bloody Mary's and mimosa flights. I'm sure they can fix you what ever drink you'd like. 

Overall we had a good experience at Hash Kitchen. The only thing that bummed me out was that the waitstaff kept reaching over the stroller with plates of hot food/coffee. We politely asked them to serve from a different side of the table."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrific. I have never experienced worse food or a worse meal. When we arrived we were told 10 minute wait for table. We sat at bar, wanted a drink while waiting. Waited 22 minutes for our drink order to be taken. 1 bartender was working two bars and outdoor tables. Got drinks about 10 minutes later. Still no table. Decided to order food at bar. Picture attached of the most horrific pastrami sandwich ever. Fatty un edible bacon they said was pastrami covered In about a 2 inch layer of Mayo. Nothing at all as they have advertised on Instagram (top pic) Bread was a half frozen Texas toast. $59 for two bloody Marys and the worst meal and service ever."}
{"text":"Honest review. Waited way to F'in long. Food was good but the atmosphere was ugh. Music with tvs going and a large open room. What ever. NEXT!"}
{"text":"Bonnie. Bonnie. Bonnie. She is Awesome!!!!!! A perfect atmosphere for breakfast .  The food was amazing & the mimosa flight!! Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Evan took great care of us and gave us some excellent recommendations! Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"I went to visit my sister in Phoenix  she took us to this place   First we got our bloody mercy which we could customized it at the special assembly bar. I had never seen that. Great idea and wonderful options. The food was extremely tasty and good. I was really impressed but the idea and ambience overall great experience. I will go there again and recommend this place to people also"}
{"text":"I was not nearly as bowled over by this place as I wanted to be....

Met up with a dear friend on Sunday for hash...one of my favorite dishes in the world.  I arrived early and got seated immediately.  Our server gave me water, then ignored me for the next 20 minutes.  Luckily the owner's wife came by and got me some coffee, which was great.

My friend arrived and we ordered as our server had miraculously appeared.  He seemed to have a limited knowledge of the menu as he could make few recommendations and told my friend that the restaurant didn't make something that was clearly on the menu.

We both ordered hash...mine was crab with sweet potato and my friend's was traditional.  Mine was bland and flavorless; I ordered a side of hollandaise to spice it up but it had no flavor either.  Both of us agreed that texture also played a big part in our overall dissatisfaction as well.

As the queen of brunch, I fully expected to be able add Hash Kitchen to the restaurant rotation but am not thinking so now.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Been to this place quite a few times now. Always hopping. Have figured out we can always count on Bonnie, hostess extraordinaire to treat us right from the moment we walk in. I've sent people to this place and told them to watch for the lady at the front desk. She's eccenteic, energized and abs
olutely delightful."}
{"text":"Super cute atmosphere at this brunch spot! We sat at the bar on the inside but they do have a cute patio/outdoor bar to eat at that would have been great too! I ordered a classic orange mimosa and it was fine, nothing special and not the best I've had. However, they do have a good variety of mimosas available (I'd suggest adding cranberry to the list) and a build your own Bloody Mary bar that was huge! We came around 9:30 or so on a Wednesday morning and they weren't very busy. I ordered the create your own scrambler with sausage, bacon, American cheese, and onion and it was delicious! Their potatoes are good but need a little bit of seasoning. The biscuit was very good and I would for sure recommend! Overall, a lovely brunch spot but I'd skip the mimosa."}
{"text":"Drinks were good, food was mediocre, service was horrible. Breakfast took an hour to show up. Explanation was \"overwhelmed waitress\". So if you come here manage your server: please come take my order, please put my order in to the kitchen, please make sure my order is being done, please bring my order when done. Don't get caught waiting for your server to notice how long you've been waiting. Management was apologetic but even management should notice a table with nothing being served while others arrive, seated, order and served when others are not. If we go back, we'll expect breakfast to become brunch, while hoping to be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Linda the manager is the bomb diggity! We had a party of 11 walk in and the hostess quoted us 2 hours. We were about to walk away when Linda came in and did everything she could to get us sat in a timely manner. She quoted us 45 minutes and we were sat in at least 30. She rocked it! :)"}
{"text":"Came to Hash Kitchen on a Sunday (Valentine's Day) for brunch. Really nice ambient. They had a DJ playing which was nice. We had regular coffee which tasted really good black. I ordered the smoked sliced brisket cornbread hash, with green chile. It was delicious! We also tried the chicken and waffles. The the texture and flavor of the chicken was perfect. For dessert we had sugar and cinnamon covered doughnuts (foreplay doughnuts) Sooo good 
Didn't try the Bloody Mary's this time but the bar was legit and everyone who had one in hand seemed to be enjoying it. 

Customer service was AWESOME! Everyone from the greeter to our server  was so genuine and welcoming. 
I am definitely a fan of Hash Kitchen and will be coming back."}
{"text":"We got really lucky finding this place.  We were on our way back home for the holiday's and I Yelped for restaurants near by.  It was conveniently only about a mile away in the same direction we were going and on the right side of the road.  We loved the food and I'm very grateful for them being so vegan friendly.  I had a veggie Hash plate with black beans, caramelized onions, broccoli, mushrooms, that was morphed around from some southwestern Huevos Rancheros menu option.  Feel free to ask for vegan menu mods.  A big shout out to Jesus, our server.  Jesus made us feel very welcome and he's so cool and helpful.  Great service at Hash and their great at their jobs.  Next time I'm back in Scottsdale, I'm trying one of those amazing looking Bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"There is a special place in my heart for Hash Kitchen. Generally there is a wait for brunch, obvi. But it is so worth it. The mimosa flights are so yummy. The chicken and waffles is to die for. The atmosphere is lively and fun. One of my favorite brunch spots!"}
{"text":"I had the farm burger and it was perfectly cooked, the burger was fresh and well seasoned with avocado, over easy egg and a spicy aioli. We agreed that it was the best burger we have had in Phoenix in a long time. The build your own Bloody Mary bar had some excellent toppings but the Czar Vodka that they infuse their own flavors into was subpar unfortunately. It had an unpleasant finish that seemed medicinal."}
{"text":"Service is poor. Food is average. Breakfast potatoes undercooked. Scrambled eggs rubbery. Trying to get attention from the server is a joke. 2nd and last time here. I thought the first must have been an oddity but this place really isn't good."}
{"text":"While I love the DJ aspect on weekends the food and service fall short. I've now been 4 times and have tried a variety of dishes. Today I had the $15 Chorizo Hash. I asked bartender if there was a lot of cheese on it, and he said yes... It came burnt and barely any chorizo or cheese. Mainly hash brown potatoes and mushrooms...I ask for more cheese from kitchen and he comes back from kitchen with a slice of cheddar cheese! I'm like uh...Shredded cheese? He goes \"we don't have shredded cheese..\" for $15 get some damn shredded cheese!!!

Service is slow on drinks and food, even when not busy. Management needs to get on this otherwise I think it's time to find new breakfast spot.."}
{"text":"Gotta say the Bloody Mary bar caught our attention, but -- as you might expect -- it's just a gimmick. The whole build-your-own thing to me says the restaurant isn't confident in their cocktail, but aside from that...the food was just OK, the place was incredibly loud, and the service was also just OK. Nah, we won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is incredible!! We are from out of town and decided to check it out! I would highly recommend this place for the vibe, good food, the Bloody Mary bar and the mimosa flight!! This place has it all and the service is excellent!! You also have to meet Bonnie! She makes the experience and is so good to all the customers!! She lights up the room!"}
{"text":"Hey, Ms. Bonnie!  You are an amazing woman with an exciting, hip restaurant!  The menu has so many delicious options, it was hard to choose:). I had the sweet potato and lump crab hash and my hubby had the breakfast burrito.  You want to talk about somethin' good?!  Everything was delicious and our server was very attentive and professional.  We are visiting from San Diego, but will be back very soon!!!"}
{"text":"The breakfast here is delicious. I've gone a few times with friends so I've tried many items and am always impressed by how good the food is. They have amazing bloody Mary's and mimosas as well. Much better than the typical IHOP or good egg fast food type breakfast. Your meal is actually individually made to order which is hard to find these days. Being from the east coast where we have diners everywhere, it has been hard to find a place to get a delicious breakfast here. Its also nice to have a classier place to go for breakfast, not many options for something like that. I've had Rachel and Ryan as servers when I go and they're both attentive, friendly and helpful about choosing menu items. I look forward to more delicious meals and drinks here!"}
{"text":"The food was great and our waiter Alec was awesome!! I will definitely be coming back and will recommend this restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"This place has a great ambience with great service. Every person on staff greeted my friend and I and asked if there was anything we needed. Our server Vincent was extremely attentive which was awesome. 

The food was incredible! Everything was so tasty and the portions were huge. The Blood Mary Bar is huge as well and the option to tailor it to your taste and spice level is so delicious. 

Check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place deserves a sixth star! Great people, great food and epic bloody bar. Lona is energetic and fun. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"my bestfriend took me here for my first time! i heard about the mimosas flights & decided to get one. they are so so amazing. it has a perfect verity of flavors! our server was Lona, she was so amazing. she was very up beat & always kept our conversation interesting! sweetest server i've ever had! i can't wait to come back & ask for her to serve us again :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE HASH KITCHEN! It's my favorite place for breakfast and trust me I take breakfast very seriously. Every time I come here I can't decide between like 7 things. Whatever I choose is delicious. Im currently eating the coconut almond French toast and I think it's safe to say I'm dead because this stuff is heaven. ask for Ryan as your server he has top notch service.

Thank you!! See you next weekend :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the gluten free buttermilk pancakes! WOW 4 HUGE pancakes arrived. They are delicious and I have leftovers to take home. Fast and friendly service and super cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came for brunch with my girlfriend and was incredibly surprised. Bree recommended that we try the Carnitas hash and it was amazing I ate the entire thing in one sitting and could not be happier. I pretty much had to be rolled out. I mean look at this picture. Phenomenal right?! The Bloody Mary bar was insane. Some lady even got a cheese stick on hers  I'll be making this a go to spot for me and my friends!"}
{"text":"Poor service. We put in our name and we were quoted 15-20 min. We didn't get called at all. Eventually we went in to see how much longer it would be (we were waiting 30+ minutes) and they had skipped over our name. We finally got sat. Waited a while for our food. Waited at least 30 minutes for our server Jesus to take our bill; it was kind of frustrating as there were just 2 in our party. It took over 2 1/2 hours to get in and out. Otherwise, good food but not worth the wait in my opinion."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give a good review here. We were so excited to try this place. I know it's Easter sunday, but we showed up early and were told there would be a 25 minute wait. No problem, we expected that. So after sitting out front and enjoying the beautiful Arizona spring weather we were excited to hear our name called. Up we went and through the dining room we walked and further around a corner and to a back room which is apparently their secondary restaurant. I'm not complaining, however I really wasn't expecting to be seated in a secondary BBQ restaurant like an uninvited cousin. If this was the seating they were offering we most definitely should have been told when we put our name on the list.Things didn't really get much better from there. The food was average and overpriced. The service, while friendly, was scant and overworked. We couldn't hear the music in the nice part of the restaurant because we were seated in what amounts to the back room. We didn't even know about the bloody mary bar until we left. I can't even stress enough our disappointment in this visit. And sadly we won't be going back even though we live around the corner."}
{"text":"Love this place! Lona provided us with great service and recommended some really good meals! There are so many mimosa choices and each one was delicious  We will definitely be coming back for brunch soon!"}
{"text":"My Book club came here and the service and food was excellent.  I truly enjoyed the atmosphere and the music was great. Bonnie is the hostess with mostest."}
{"text":"Love this place! I come every time I'm in Scottsdale. Great food, great service.  I haven't had a bad meal, but my favorite is Christina's Tamale Cakes."}
{"text":"The legendary Bloody Mary is reason enough to go to The Hash Kitchen (THK), but it turns out that they serve up some awesome breakfast dishes too.  They also have a wall of fame with all the athletes and celebrities who ate here as well.

I rarely get Bloody Mary's, so I opted for the THK Bloody Mary instead of building my own.  The drink itself was spicy yet refreshing, and had a smoky flavor from bacon-infused vodka.  I enjoyed all the edible condiments: celery, bacon, pepperoni, pickles, and zucchini.  Perfect appetizers.

The sweet potato hash with lump crab meat came with two soft poached eggs and hollandaise sauce was outstanding.  My wife found it a bit rich but I like pairing egg with real crab meat. 

Chicken and Waffles was another excellent dish, especially with fried leeks on top.  Waffles had bacon bits inside.  Chicken was breast only but had crispy breading and soft, juicy interior.  It rivals our previous favorite chicken and waffle at San Francisco's Bluestem Brasserie.

Solid 5 stars.  Hash Kitchen makes breakfast great again.  Perfect meal to fuel up for a day of hiking!"}
{"text":"Great place, dog friendly patio, attentive wait staff.

Food here is VERY good! Try the coconut and almond encrusted french toast."}
{"text":"Very good food and excellent customer service. The prices are a bit steep for breakfast food."}
{"text":"First off, the Bloody Mary bar is phenomenal. So many different infused vodkas, so many different toppings to add on or in. 
Food is amazing, I got the chicken and waffle which was amazing. The lump crab and sweet potato hash was also very very good. 
My girlfriend and I both shared a mimosa flight which came with guava, orange, grapefruit, and mango. All these flavors were great, especially the mango and guava!! 
Lastly, the service is great our server Deanna was great and very helpful with suggestions! Very pleased with my brunch experience here at Hash kitchen!! Will be back...tomorrow!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast, very friendly server Gino.  The food  was excellent although the corn tortillas that came with the carnitas were hard as a rock and the fried onion strings on the carnitas hash didn't make any sense flavor wise, but it was delicious and a huge portion!  Start out with the cannoli donuts, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe the buzz that was in this place for a brunch on a Sunday morning.  The wait wasn't too bad about 20 minutes, but more and more people kept checking in to wait for a table.  All of the items on their menu looked good and made me want to try everything.  I had a really hard time deciding on what to choose, but I went with their specialty dish Breakfast Lasagna. The dish sounded delicious and interesting, so i had to give it a try. My husband tried the Carnitas Hash.  

The Breakfast Lasagna was creamy and satisfying, it definitely hit the spot. It was filled with breakfast favorites eggs, sausage, bacon as well as traditional lasagna ingredients such as ricotta and mozzarella. The Carnitas Hash was also delightful, the carnitas were very tender and flavorful. The dish arrived on a skillet still bubbling on the side with gooey cheese. We'd love to try other dishes here and will definitely go back the next time we're in phoenix!

Parking can be an issue, when we visited there was construction in a nearby store so part of the parking lot was blocked off and limited the number of parking spaces."}
{"text":"We were in town for the weekend for a Bucs game and decided to give this place a try before the game. The restaurant itself was packed when we got there around 1030am on a Sunday. We were told that it'd be about a 25-30 minute wait but they actually got us in within 15 minutes. The place was packed, lots of people and the DJ was loud but in a fun way. We ordered the Paella Hash and the Breakfast Cannelloni. Both had good flavor but i'd probably pass on the paella hash. Although tasty, it wasn't what we were expecting. The Breakfast Cannelloni was superb though. Good place to try, I'd probably be back again once I try other brunch spots."}
{"text":"Best brunch spot in Scottsdale! Plus now they're opening a north Scottsdale and Arcadia location!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and a super energetic environment expect a long wait if you are going on the weekend, but the Bloody Mary bar can help make the time pass a little faster lol"}
{"text":"New favorite......I love when you find a breakfast place with something different and unique.  There are so many options and I love that you get a biscuit with your scrambles. The biscuits are really good and a nice change from toast.  I also like that you can chose items to put in your scrambles. The eggs and veggies in my scramble were fresh and cooked perfect. Little cup of their potatoes that comes with it had good flavor. The service was fast and our waiter was great. I went with my mother and we both really liked the music in the background.  Fun, upbeat atmosphere, which may be the reason we just had to have a Bloody Mary!  We  had the house one, which was really good!  Next time will be more daring and try the Bloody Mary bar.  Can't wait to take my out of town guest here next week."}
{"text":"Terrible estimate of time to be seated. We were told 45 minutes but it actually took an hour and 30 minutes to be seated. The mimosa flight was good, but two of the three meals we ordered came wrong.  The other two dishes were of poor quality. The biscuits and gravy was under seasoned and the tamale and egg dish was undercooked. The food just wasn't worth the extremely long wait."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I love going for brunches, tried this place for the first time today and I'm happy I did. My friends and I had a fantastic time. Service was good and fast. Menu had decent options to choose from and food was yummy!
And yes, Guava mimosa was really awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great food and a fun atmosphere!! Good place for all ages! I've been here several times and always have gotten breakfast but they do have lunch options too!!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and I was excited because I have heard so many good things. If I could give 0 stars I would, the server Tiana is rude and does not know anything about customer service. I will never be coming back and I will make sure to never recommend this place."}
{"text":"We are staying at the Hyatt down the road from Hash Kitchen and decided to try it this morning with our kids. It was delicious! The Bloody Mary bar was a fun treat and even without all the olives and bacon, the drink was perfectly seasoned. I had the crab Benedict and my husband had the chilaquiles. Both were flavorful and worth every calorie. The kids devoured their pancakes. The service and hostess were very friendly , so all in all, this was a great dining experience and we would definitely come back here the next time we are in Arizona."}
{"text":"Diverse menu so there is something for everyone here. The skillet was great and their biscuits are fluffy and delicious. Most impressive Bloody Mary bar in town!"}
{"text":"I happened to be visiting with family for the holiday and we went for Saturday breakfast.  When the 6 of us got there we were warmly welcomed by Diane.  I was struck by the upbeat vibe and knew before being seated that breakfast was going to be great.  All of us at the table were amazed at the friendliness of the staff and when my crab eggs bennidict arrived it was so great.  Looking around the joint I noticed that a lot of people were indulging in the 10 dollar make your own bloody mary.  You could make a meal of the fixings like skewers of bacon, olives, pickles, veggies etc.  Wow I have never seen anything like it! 
Linda who was not even our server came over and started talking with us.  She and Bonnie (who was dancing and impeccibly dressed) were the reason I would recommend going to the place.   The food speaks for itself and it is NOT your average breakfast place.  You must try it.... go now!!!!"}
{"text":"Ahh...are you willing to pay $17 for a breakfast burrito? These folks have gotten a bit full of themselves now since they started adding other locations. It was only our 2nd visit, but they changed the menu and clearly raised some of the prices to aid their expansion plans. Adding steak to the breakfast burrito does not make it worth \"Ritz\" prices. The burrito got very average reviews and we did not find any caviar in the burrito either. The waffle with berries was way more reasonable at eight bucks and that was pretty good, along with unlimited coffee refills. It was a weekday, so the place was empty. Also, would not suggest the breakfast potatoes since they are tiny potatoes that you would find in the frozen aisle (like O'Brien style by Ore-Ida). Not worthy of a return - let the millenials waste their cash on high priced eggs,"}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant on Sunday and not impressed.  Wouldn't recommend.  The DJ had the music on too loud. Service was slow and waited 75 minutes for our food which wasn't great. There are many other breakfast restaurants that are better here in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Just finished morning golf at McDowell and was looking for lunch...landed at Hash Kitchen. Great bloody Mary, awesome Coconut French toast and cannoli pancakes.  Jesus was our waiter and took great care of us.  Will come back."}
{"text":"After hearing of a long wait at Butter we did a search on Yelp and found this gem.   Great breakfast, brunch spots.  Drinks were awesome, food was great and seems to really take an effort to make sure everyone is happy and kids enjoyed themselves.  And they had great music playing as well."}
{"text":"What a great place.  We had a group of 20 and they served us without a hitch.  On top of that, the food and most importantly the Bloody Mary bar are to die for.  My wife and I had the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and the Smoked Brisket and Corn Bread Hash.  They were both excellent.  The only thing that might be questioned were the fresh made cake donuts which were good but a little gooey.  They were good for me but some folks might not like them.  Other than that, everything else was great.  Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Finally! Scottsdale needed a brunch spot like this! The build your own bloody mary bar is by far the best I've seen in the area. They have every topping you could imagine... something like 40 different options. And don't even get me started on their food! TO DIE FOR. I am a harsh critic of eggs bennies, and the three out of five I've tried so far were absolutely delicious. They really have everything you could possibly want for brunch. I could eat here every single day. Their hashes are sooooo good, they have fried chicken and waffles, french toast, red velvet pancakes... It's like I died and went to heaven. Needless to say, I am a huge fan of this spot. The overall vibe and atmosphere is just great and somewhere I'll probably take my friends weekly. I definitely recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"Tried breakfast this weekend as it is my favourite meal, and I heard a lot of hype about Hash Kitchen. My husband and I sat at the bar and were unimpressed by the lackluster service. The bar tender basically threw our menus at us. When we ordered drinks (only water and coffee), the woman who took the order did not even deliver and the coffee dispenser was literally right behind her. Finally, a third bar tender took our order, and she was attentive and amazing. 

The food was good but the inconsistent service made it seem sub par. I gave this place two stars for the one excellent bar tender;  I also enjoyed the interior of the restaurant. 

There are better breakfast places in Scottsdale for the same price point and atmosphere, and I would recommend spending your time and money at another establishment."}
{"text":"We had the lump crab, sweet potato hash this morning. The eggs on top were cooked perfectly. The shredded sweet potato hash had some peppers in it, just enough to add flavor. The crab was mixed in and on the sweet potato. Also had a little sauce too and a good biscuit. It was delicious!Mmm
Also the coffee was very good, and strong, the way I like it.
Would've given 5 stars, but we had the booth next to the DJ. Yes they have a DJ at 11:00am on Saturday. He played a lot of Michael Jackson, which Is great, but it was  little loud for breakfast. Good place to people watch too.
We will definitely go back again. But we'll sit somewhere further from the DJ."}
{"text":"WOW! Amazing service, had my sisters bachelorette brunch here and we could not have been treated better! Also so cute inside, the DJ played great music but not too loud! Awesome food, awesome mimosas it was truly the perfect place for our event! Thank you! Also my party was short of our reservation (made for ten only seven came) and they were really nice about it"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my fiancé and both times were quite good. We've split several of the hashes and the Benedict's. I have to say that the smoked brisket was the winner out of all the dishes I've tried. The cornbread was just sweet enough to counter the smoke and salt of the brisket and also to balance out the green chili. Another favorite was the fried chicken hash although was a little over cooked and overall ate a little dry. The eggs Benedict was just ok and not overly impressed with the hollandaise. Lastly we had the crab skillet with old bay aioli which again was just ok. Crab was good but could have been fresher. The sauce sold the dish, delicious. Lastly, the Bloody Mary bar... Big fan. Any excuse to stick as much goodness into a morning cockatail as I can fit!  The flavored vodkas were delicious, especially the cilantro lime and they don't skimp on it;). Also tried a bloody without the bells and whistles of the buffet style build it your way and it was still equally delicious and less work. I highly recommend Hash kitchen if only for a morning cocktail and some good hangover chow."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant... possibly the best breakfast menu I've seen.  I settled on the biscuits/gravy and Italian sausage, and the wife had the smoked salmon frittata... I've only had b/g twice before, but BY FAR, these were the best I've ever had, gravy was smooth and tasty.  I highly recommend doing breakfast/brunch here.

Oh, and the coffee actually had some flavour to it, not like other chain restaurants. 

Try it, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Best brunch I've had in AZ. No questions asked. 

I probably would have given this place five stars for the Bloody Mary bar alone... it's insane. Meatballs, fried raviolis, slim jims, flavored vodka, bacon, olives, peppers... you name it. It was easily a meal in itself. 

If you're not a Bloody Mary person (then what's wrong with you!?) they have a great mimosa selection! We got the flight with original, raspberry, mango and kiwi. If you don't need four full size drinks at 9am go with the mango. 

Now that we were good and tipsy we got to eat breakfast. I had the monkey bread which was incredible. But I actually ate more of my friends plate of the breakfast cannelloni. Sounds weird, I know but trust me it was incredible. Ugh, I'm drooling just thinking about it. 

Can't wait to go back for round two and try everything else! LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorites for brunch if ... the DJ and Bloody Mary bar... then throw in some great chilaquiles and service and your done."}
{"text":"Creative options on the Build Your own Bloody Mary Bar and a huge variety of foods on the menu make Hash Kitchen superb! The staff was friendly, inviting, and knowledgeable, and the food was fresh and flavorful. 

The Crab Lump Eggs Benedict was amazing. The biscuits and gravy made an amazing appetizer to share and the Carnitas Hash had the perfect crispy potatoes and flavor to compliment the savory, soft, and tender pork. Top those meals off with some fried or poached eggs and your breakfast is complete!!"}
{"text":"Would not recommend coming during Saturday or Sunday days as the service isn't up to standard. Food delays were at 30mins, and our frittata came out burnt. They remedied the frittata 10 mins after the fact, and the rest of the food wasn't terrible, but like I said, wouldn't recommend on weekends unless you want a party scene"}
{"text":"My wife and I chose The Hash Kitchen in part because of previous reviews and in part because they serve French press coffee.   I had the lump crab &  sweet potato hash.   It was excellent.   My wife had the Spanish fritata.   She said it was good,  but not great.   The French press coffee was really good and an ample serving.   Service was very good.   Candice was pleasant and attentive.   Recommended for breakfast."}
{"text":"The service was incredible and the food was excellent! We arrived on a busy super bowl Sunday morning and enjoyed the pineapple and grapefruit mimosa while waiting.  We were seated way less than the time provided which was awesome! I enjoyed the lump crab and sweet potato hash which was absolutely delicious.  Our server was attentive and very sweet.  The decor and music, amazing! The location was somewhat confusing to find and the receptionist was not very helpful. FYI it's a walking distance from Panera if you can't find it.  Def must go when in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I've called the Scottsdale Hash Kitchen multiple times and have waited about 5 minutes to even talk to someone after being on hold each time I - not to mention the phone rang for longer than minute before I got placed on hold. I'm now ordering Togo from another restaurant since this one obviously could care less about it's Togo customers"}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience today at Hash Kitchen off Frank Lloyd Right from the moment we walked in to leaving. Our first observation was the atmosphere and positive energy within the restaurant. Ms. Bonnie was OUTSTANDING; such an awesome spirit she has. The staff was friendly and very helpful since it was our first time there. I would highly recommend this restaurant !"}
{"text":"Where else can you make your OWN Bloody Mary?!  We tried the jalapeño and cilantro vodka and both were great.  Additions included hot peppers, BACON, asparagus, green beans, pickles, Worcestershire sauce and pretty much anything else you could want...even bacon rimming the glasses.  Food-wise, the chicken and waffles were tasty, with bacon inside the waffles and juicy chicken, with the fried leeks adding a nice touch.  Berry stuffed pancakes with mascarpone were delicious as well.  Interior was tastefully decorated and Chris was a great attentive server.  Definitely come here if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Try the Mimosa Flight at 8am - it's a must!! Got seated quick with no wait and enjoyed the atmosphere and service. Food is incredible"}
{"text":"I love this place for brunch. And, the bloody mary bar can you say yummy. The hostess is so great and the food is amazing. Definitely a place for friends, business, or a bloody mary filled day. Can't wait for the new location to open!"}
{"text":"Always a favorite for me.  The Chicken Hash is always my go to. The bloody mary bar is a plus.  How can you ever go wrong.."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Love the Bloody Mary bar and Mimosa flights and the food is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"The hash kitchen is a great place for breakfast, brunch or lunch. It was really busy but the wait wasn't too bad. I loved the music there it's like a morning party!! 
Food was amazing really big portion and very special dishes !!! 
I tried the french toast which was great! I would like to go back and try one of their hashes though because they looked A+ !!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing place! The bloody Mary Bar right when you walk in is about as close to heaven as you can get! Adrian hooked up our bloody Mary's and was the nicest guy ever! He made our day. Our server Ryan was brand new, but you couldn't tell at all. He had great suggestions about what to order and everything came out perfectly and quickly. I will definitely be back when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure who is in control of the waitlist for this establishment - the employees at Hash Kitchen or the people at Yelp. Whoever it is, they need to get do a better job. The waitlist on the Yelp app said the current wait time was \"0 mins\" all the way up until we parked. We get inside and the wait is an hour - Whoa.

Let's also add the 45 minutes it took for our friends to get here from the other side of town. I guess it's a good thing drinks are easily accessible. Otherwise, I don't think we would have waited.

Another disappointment: They got rid of the lump crab eggs benedict. Please bring it back.

The prosecco smash drinks were yummy. Essentially prosecco, berry puree, blueberries and strawberries. 

My fiance and I shared the breakfast sandwich and the fried chicken eggs benedict. I would get the fried chicken eggs benedict again because the chicken was pretty good. The sandwich was just okay - nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Katie was great and every single thing we ordered was fantastic! Atmosphere is upbeat and you should plan on taking your time when you check it out. Unique and fresh menu....we will be back 4sure!"}
{"text":"Holy cow this is the first brunch spot I've been with a live DJ! At first it seemed a little awkward and so early to be bumping on a Sunday morning. But grab yourself a bloody Mary you crafted yourself or one of their mimosas and it's Saturday all over again! We had their brunch bruschetta, Benedict fries and hash monkey for starters. The hash monkey was my favorite and second was the Nutella banana bruschetta. Unfortunately not so many options for vegans, Vegetarians are better off. I did a veggie scramble with out the egg and hash browns instead, I was a little disappointed. My husband got their Oreo pancakes which we're delish! I also had the mango and guava mimosas, both were really good but guava was my favorite."}
{"text":"Been here a dozen times and didn't think it was possible for it to get better cause it's already A+. The service today from the warm welcome from Bonnie to our excellent service from Ryan was perfect. The food is to die for, and breakfast cocktails out of this works. Best Bloody Mary bar in the valley. Thank you Joey for opening such a great place close to our home."}
{"text":"I asked our waiter, Gino, what was the best dish on the menu and he said \"the pastrami sandwich\". Needless to say, I got the pastrami sandwich and it was the best pastrami sandwich of my life."}
{"text":"Being from out of town; I saw the high ratings and decided to drive 35 minutes to have breakfast here. I'm so glad I did! The service was exceptional. The ambiance was nice and beautiful, cute blood Mary bar if you like. (Not my kinda thing). 
We came on a Friday around 10:30am and were seated immediately. The prices was reasonable all staff was very friendly, will definitely come back. Especially for the lump crab benedict and the chicken and waffles. My gf had the croque Madame and was in love with that. No complaints at all, similarly reminds me of Hash House in SD and Vegas, but the prices is lower and the quantity was gods, they didn't tower the whole plate with too much. Thank you guys, I'll be back next time I'm in AZ!"}
{"text":"We were a party of seven.  Seated within 20 minutes on a busy Sunday.  Amazing Bloody Mary Bar and great mimosas. The best thing was we had two vegetarians in our party and they customized the hash to be all vegetables and no eggs.  Food was quite good albeit some could have been hotter in temperature.   We had the
 specially prepared vegetable hash corned beef hash eggs Benedict egg scramble and French toast. Jen was our waitress and made the custom hash happen. She was great!  Jen was attentive and friendly and extremely helpful.  The only criticism I have is the music was rather loud and made it difficult to have conversations."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Fun, relaxing and friendly place. Lots of hash at our table, but I had the Coconut Encrusted French Toast with caramelized bananas. Yum! My friends said the hash was also highly pleasurable. The highlight was none other than the most exquisite bloody mary bar I have ever seen. (Ask about the secret door to the craft beer restaurant)

Thanks to Chris for a breakfast blast!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the food was FANTASTIC!!! Build Your Own Bloody Mary bar is on point too. Only downside is the service is a little slow at times, but not to the point where it would keep me from coming back. 

I've had the salmon benedict, the stuffed french toast, a build your own omelet with crab, and the ranchero hash. Nothing bad to say about any of the dishes. Portions on most things are on the large side, so come hungry or prepared to take leftovers home. Or just roll your stuffed self out of the building."}
{"text":"Fabulous customer service.  Great food! Bloody Mary bar is kick ass.  Oh! Hello Mimosas.  Run to eat here!"}
{"text":"This is my second time to the restaurant so I took company along - here for the morning 
And it was certainly disappointing - my husband ordered hash something and when it came to the table we all gasped - did not look edible and my friend Pam ordered something else that I would not have eaten either - everything seemed deep-fried very heavy and not breakfast like at all - I was so grateful I ordered the parfait and Pam's son ordered the French toast but didn't say too much about it
Nobody said they were excited about their meal - we just had a conversation and finished 
And the service was slow we waited a long time for breakfast and there weren't that many people in there - we arrived at 10:30 and left at 12:30 since we were having a little bit of a reunion I'm not impressed with the place - the front door was open so hot air was coming in all of the time 
The receptionist blame women for breaking the door and said they were pushing out instead of pulling out which I thought was really a rude thing to say about the customers 
I was glad we moved to the back of the restaurant 
The place seems to have gone downhill just in the few months since I was there the first time with my tennis group"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing brunch. Enjoyed every minute. Everything was very flavorful and filling. Service was attentive and right on point. Price point was average for the surrounding area. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"So great for breakfast on a weekday or weekend. If you like sweets the s'mores French toast is an absolute must. Crave it so often"}
{"text":"Bloody. Mary. Bar.

Not just some crap fixings and garbage vodka.  Titos. House made infused vodkas.  Bacon.  Bacon salt. Pickled everything...

And the food is freaking awesome.  

This place is a winner."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I live in Scottsdale and we are surrounded by a lot of beautiful, high priced, OK food with server's who are just trying to get through the day.  Not \"The Hash Kitchen\".  Yes it's new, yes it's pretty and comfy and aesthetically pleasing, so pleasing I had a bloody mary at noon, but it's more.  The food is fresh and delicious but the people made the difference.  I would be pleased to meet a client there or have brunch.  Today,I was met by a lovely lady outside the front door welcoming me and letting me know my girlfriend was already there.  Then I met our server Chris.  Chris and his quick wit made it OK for us to drink in the middle of the day.  I appreciated that.  He led the way to the Bloody Mary Bar (BMB) and mixed up the basics for us 1st using one of their own infused vodkas.  Tina, aka Gina, and I had a vodka infused with cilantro and I added some habanero for a spicy kick.  He then waved his left hand out, palm up and to the side as if to say \"ta da\", inviting us to add over 20 side items to our drink.  2 thick pieces of bacon to start, oysters chilling on ice, horseradish which I stupidly added after the habanero, 3 kinds of olives, at least 3 kind of pickles, I think I saw a whole egg, maybe asparagus?, I'm not sure, I saw salami and Slim Jim's and was done.  SLIM JIM.  I'm not going to lie, I was real classy, I put 1 in my purse and gave it to my husband when I got home.  We also met fellow server Anthony and the proud owner Joey who between those 2 and Chris, I'd just go back for the comedy team.  I know what's going to happen.  People are going to catch on about how great this place is and I'll never get a breakfast seat again, maybe I'll get an honorary booth in the back.  I'm going back for chicken and waffles, bacon in the waffle yes please!, and Nutella and banana French toast.  Your fan, Keri aka Terry."}
{"text":"When my experience differs so greatly from other Yelpers, I have to wonder if they were having an off day.  

We started with the Monkey Bread which, at $11, is way overpriced.  What we received was a honey bun sized cinnamon roll.  It was somewhat dry but tasty enough.  For that price, I expected something a little more interesting.  

While I didn't partake, the bloody mary bar looks like a thing of beauty.  

I ordered the quinoa burger and I get the direction they were going this with, but it needs work.  The quinoa/veggie patty was extraordinarily bland.  The goat cheese, onions and pea shoots weren't even close to enough to boost the flavor.  The fries were tasty.  

My husband did enjoy his fried chicken but did not care for his espresso cocktail.  

Finally, service wasn't terribly good.  Our waiter walked past us multiple times while we were both sitting there not eating with our napkins on the table."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first and had an great experience! Everyone was super friendly and we were checked on not only by our awesome server, Gino, but by a couple other employees too. Gino did a fantastic job and even gave me a biscuit to try since it was my first time in. We did the build your own Bloody Mary bar which was fantastic and she shared a flight of mimosas that were really good too. Great presentation of the Bloody Mary bar and the mimosas. They had a DJ that played some great songs and it was loud but not so loud that too couldn't carry on a conversation; more of a fun loud with good music. We loved how open the restaurant was too. Our food was delicious and we can wait to go back to try other menu items. I tried the carnitas hash and my boyfriend had the huevos rancheras hash and both were excellent. We saw a lot of breakfast burritos and French toast going by to other tables so we might try those items next. Great place and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance of this place. Classy and comfortable. Unfortunately, wasn't impressed with the food. Our table started with the donut and Nutella appetizer which looked amazing and our friends said it was delicious. But my main course of the gluten free pancakes was unimpressive. Over cooked on the bottom and really hard. I had to dip them in my coffee to soften them. No Bueno. In addition, my white scramble was only ok. Nothing special and kinda bland. For a $20 meal, was hoping for better. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere is 5 star, too bad the food isn't up to snuff. Haven't found a place yet to compete with Butters down the street for eggs and gf pancakes at a great price."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonably priced and love the build your own Bloody Mary bar...WOW! :D"}
{"text":"This place is not a 5 star! It's a 10 star! The ambiance is amazing! The bloody marry bar....only a genius can come up with that idea! The food was delicious. Smoked brisket and eggs....amazing! The fried chicken with hash browns breakfast...even better! I am so glad we tried this place out! Can't wait  to come back!"}
{"text":"Update March 13, 2018: On March 2, 2018, owner, Joey, reached out to me via direct message about my underwhelming first experience which was a nice gesture; however, he did not follow through with his words. He offered to compensate me with a coupon for my next visit which I was not expecting- but I guess I was never going to receive it anyways as I never heard back from him after his initial message. A phony move for lack of better words. 

I'm not looking any hands out. I don't need the coupon; I'm not even sure if I would've gone back to use it. But I've read many similar reviews to mine about lack of quality, overpriced subpar food, with an unorganized system at the host stand. Hopefully the owner gains some integrity and finds better structure as he leads the success of his business."}
{"text":"I can't believe I waited 45 min for this place. For being a Hash House they should at least master a crispy potato. I could duplicate the potato's I received by taking a frozen bag of Oreida breakfast potatoes and throwing them in the microwave. And then the breakfast lasagna.... yuck! Giant clunky dish with barley warmed mush with noodles. It was pretty terrible."}
{"text":"Definitely nice presentation of breakfast entrees. Service was very friendly but very slow on Sunday morning. Took 45 minutes to get our order. Blasting music inside appears to be standard and the place was packed with millennials.  Luckily we were sitting outside. We would NOT have been happy sitting inside"}
{"text":"Great weekend vibe!! Love the live DJ!! The food was tasty and service was awesome. We will back here....maybe tomorrow!!

Totally check out the fruity pebble cocktail too!"}
{"text":"First time to dine at The Hash Kitchen.  We were greeted by a very upbeat team including the owner.  
The environment was inviting and energetic but not to loud like so many restaurants.  The place was very clean and has a very knowledgeable staff.  There bar has a Bloody Mary bar and a Mimosa flight. Oh we are coming back for that.  The coffee was exceptional and my wife knows coffee.
She ordered the mexicana scrambler and I had the Notorious Burger. 4.5 out of 5 on both meals.   Give them a shot!"}
{"text":"Not trying to get anyone in trouble or anything free just disappointed that 1 time and a little embarrassed after I bragged so much.  Don't worry we will back and if there is ever a problem I'll address it before leaving.  I know people sometimes complain to get free or discounted meals, that wasn't my intentions. See you soon your response was enough to know you care. Thanks"}
{"text":"Wide variety of delicious food on there menu. Very friendly staff and delicious food. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick brunch after landing from a long flight and stumbled upon Hash! What a great choice! Our server Lona was outstanding!! Great service!! What a great time we had! Bloody Mary bar and flights are a must!! Will be back before we head home."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place!  Went there 2 of 3 days I was in Scottsdale.  Had the pleasure of being served by Alec on both days who was super cool and gave great recs.

We had the carnitas hash, crab benedict, apple pie pancakes and crab roll.  Our favorites were the pancakes and crab roll.  The pancakes were super fluffy and with the apple and pie crush paired with ice cream was soooooo freaking good.  The crab roll was superb.  We also paired it with 2 bloody marys and loaded it with oyster, bacon, pickles, slim jims, beef jerky, celery, blue cheese olives...need I say more?  

Next time I am in Scottsdale I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"The drinks are solid. Sadly, I ordered the bacon and Brie bruschetta and then got a sampler platter instead with sweet ones that had Nutella and fruits in addition to the one I ordered. I'm sure they were great but just not what I like or ordered. I asked the waitress about it and she said she was sorry she didn't mention they only sold this variety bruschetta plate. She was very nice and went back to ask the kitchen to make me a full order with just the bacon and Brie, which was very nice. Then they brought it out and it was just some sad bacon on bread without Brie... this was probably a one off experience. I won't come back but I won't deter others. Just clarify your order... a few times.

Hi Joe"}
{"text":"Food was hit and miss. Some of the items we ordered were great and some were just okay. I feel like the hype is mostly about the atmosphere, location, etc. and somehow in most people's minds that makes the food taste better. Portions were smaller than average. Solid restaurant, slow service and slightly above average food."}
{"text":"Wow this place was awesome! Build your own Bloody Mary bar, live DJ, amazing breakfast, and a mimosa in pretty much any flavor! The coconut almond French toast was amazing! 

Can't wait to come back. Be sure to get here early. You'll for sure have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"A few of us had a late leisurely breakfast today. Two of us had gluten free pancakes and waffles.  Attentive wait staff,coffee refills without asking,and a laid back vibe.A table near us was drinking Bloody Mary's and celebrating a birthday needless to say the portions are huge,and doggy bags left with us. We would definitely have another breakfast gathering here.The only drawback was the flashing bulbs from some kind of PR photo shoot which did hasten our departure"}
{"text":"The best brunch food in town! This place is always hoppin busy and the staff is so nice and Bonnie was there today keeping the place running like clockwork!! Love the Maggiore family and thier wonferfully hospitable establishments!"}
{"text":"From the minute we walked in I knew I was going to like it. As we were being sat I saw the BMB which got me pretty excited. The hostess who sat us was very friendly as she asked my girls if they liked to color... she came back with crayons and and paper from a coloring book. 
Our server was great!  I ordered the create your on BM and he told me to go at it.  The bartender manning the BMB was friendly and gave recommendations. I am very happy with my choice!  Half traditional and half habenero mix, with cilantro lime infused vodka, and a bacon salt rim and garnish for weeks.  It was a meal in in itself. 
For the meal I ordered the biscuits and gravy (something I never order, but was feeling it today). It was perfect! But like most restaurants the portion size was huge.  
My only regret for the whole meal was that I was too full to try the Nutella donuts (donut of the month)...next time."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the Hatch Kitchen in north Scottsdale. It should be noted that we visited on Mother's Day so you may have a completely different experience if you go on a nonholiday.  We had reservations for 1pm and were seated just after 1:30pm. Understandably, it was very busy. We were seated directly in from of the DJ booth, which was cool, but a little loud.  The server was polite, but slow and missed several items/requests throughout our meal.  The Bloody Mary bar was a fun concept, but because of the rush many items were not available. The mimosa flight was a fun twist, however as the flight was delivered the server accidentally spilled all 4 glasses, most of which ended up in my lap. Accidents happen, but it made for an uncomfortable experience as my pants were soaked.  Nobody other than the server ever came over regarding this accident- I expected the manager to come apologize and/or to offer to comp a drink or something. This didn't happen. Our meals were delivered about 40 minutes after we ordered (again, with some items missing and/or inaccurate).  All of our meals were presented nicely and had good flavor. The meals were also reasonably priced. Overall, a decent experience."}
{"text":"Don't let the pictures deceive you. This was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. We came to celebrate a birthday and were told the day before that they didn't accept reservations less than 10 people (we were a party of five). We decided to get there right when they opened so we wouldn't have to wait. The manager asked if we wanted to sit outside and when we asked to have a table inside, he acted like it was a big deal (which makes no sense because it was empty and there were plenty of tables that were clearly not reserved). Apparently they were understaffed by 3 people and their ticket machine was down so our ticket was lost or never got printed, we are still trying to figure that out. It took over an hour to get our food, which came before our appetizer and everything was just awful. The food tasted sour, undercooked, and messy. It was embarrassing. It took over 20 minutes to get condiments and everyone looked so unhappy there. While the server tried her best, and genuinely felt awful about our experience - I am most shocked that the three managers knew what was going on and purposefully avoided our table. 10/10 would not recommend. They also expected us to pay the whole bill when everyone ate less than a forth of our food because it was so awful. We left and went to another restaurant for breakfast. If management continues the way they handled our situation, this place will not be there long. I understand why 3 people didn't show up today if they had to work for those three morons who don't know how to manage a business."}
{"text":"I love love love Hash Kitchen!! They have the best breakfast in Scottsdale, hands down.

I've had the crab benedict, the lemon pancakes, and the crab hash.  All items are ROCKSTAR!!
The food, the flavors, the fun ambience, I wish they stayed open for dinner! 

Apparently the secret is out though -- weekends, expect to wait. Expect to wait, and then have mediocre service. Our server took about 15 minutes to get to us, and then when we asked for the check, it took another 20 minutes and there were two items that we didn't order.  
I've been there during the week though, and the service during less crowded times is on point and friendly and quick and accurate.  My only suggestion here would be to hire one or two more servers for the weekend hussle and bussle.  Otherwise, this place is absolutley amazing and I'm so glad its right around the corner from me."}
{"text":"Awesome bloody Mary bar! We were a party of 5 and 3 of us tried the build you own Bloody Mary and definitely enjoyed the experience and our drink. We were not as impressed with the food... all but one of us had the hash and we all felt... meeeh. We will come back for the Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to lunch today and decided to try The Hash Kitchen. After looking at the menu we decided to try their amazing breakfast menu.  
We were so not disappointed. The herb crusted chicken and waffles were amazing as was the coconut French toast with bananas and sauce. 
The service was great. Thanks Dominique for your suggestions and wonderful service. Also, shout out to Bonnie as a great hostess and made sure we were taken care of. 
Pam and I have already decided we will be back to try the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot!   Loved the corned beef hash and the diy Bloody Mary bar.   
Sarah our server was fantastic and quite easy on the eyes as well ;)

Only complaint was that we really wished they offered fresh maple syrup for the French toast :("}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are stellar, otherwise this would have been a 1-star review. We got one cup of coffee and one cup of water each (ended up grabbing the carafes off the bar and refilling our own), our starters came out with our mains, the plating was cramped, the server seemed to lack basic training, and then we had to sit around waiting to pay the huge bill. No one seemed to understand that they had done anything wrong."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast with friends and family from out of town. Aimee was the hostess with the mostess. Great variety and taste.  Moderately priced. Our waitress was great as well."}
{"text":"The Food was amazing. My first time but will not be my my last and Bonnie makes the the restauraunt atmosphere Perfect! You feel welcomed and her personality and interaction makes you want to come back and be served by the best!!! Please check them out take a friend."}
{"text":"Great place to have a fun Sunday family breakfast. We loved this restaurant even if the music was too loud. I had the Carnitas Hash. Shredded pork,potaoes, avocado with egg over easy on top. It was very good. I could have used some salsa. But it was still delicious. Everyone was happy with what they got. The service was very friendly and helpful from everyone. The manager even stopped by to chat!!  This restaurant was really busy, their bloody Mary's are very popular and quite impressive!! I had a virgin bloody Mary which was a little spicy and perfect. 4**** only because the music was too loud for a Sunday morning and i felt like I was at a club."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast/brunch on a Sunday morning! We didn't have to wait long for a high top table. As we sat down we were greeted promptly. We did the Bloody Mary bar. Where you build your own Bloody Mary. I must say it was AMAZING. There were so many options of things to put in your Bloody Mary. The bartender working that bar was very friendly and helped us out a whole lot. I had the vegetable scrambler which was also cooked perfectly for what your paying the food is really good. Our server Anthony was so sweet and and extremely tentative. He definitely made the experience there even better. We will definitely be visiting this neighborhood spot more often!"}
{"text":"Great new breakfast place. The food was excellent. Service in spite  of being full and busy was fast. Linda the manager is hands on and checked on us to make sure we were taken care of. Ambience is perfect."}
{"text":"My second time at Hash Ktchen on FLW BLVD, both times great, Sunday is always a blast, dj music and hopefully Weston is there to give you five star service, thats what I've experienced, food is great, so many options, make your own Bloody Mary's, always a mood lifter and the entire staff is accommodating and makes you feel welcome.  Saturdays and Sundays if you're in a party mood but always great any day of the week."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago, and will admit that our party was a bit of a difficult one. We had a few people with food allergies, and there were a few mix ups, but the wait staff, manager, and owner were fantastic and overly accommodating. Honestly, we probably owe them a huge apology for causing such a fuss on such a busy day. Not only did the managers personally check on the table to ensure our party entirely satisfied, but the owner came over herself to make sure everything had been fixed. 

The food is amazing, I highly recommend trying one of their signature hashes, and absolutely do NOT skip the Bloody Mary bar. If it's not your thing they also have a great mimosa deal!"}
{"text":"I start by saying I am VERY particular on my brunch. If you're looking for a fun, hip, lively place with incredible food and creative drinks, you won't find a better spot! We first met Bonnie when we walked in. She greeted us with a smile and a whole lot of great personality. The food, was insanely delicious. Honestly was hard to narrow down what to get. We ordered the hash chicken and lemon ricotta pancakes. Then the drinks... if your a fan of bloody Mary's they have a whole make your own bar with great selections to choose from. We tried the flight mimosa and the strawberry was awesome! Do yourself a favor and check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm so glad I made a pit stop here. I am very impressed at everything! Walked in and I was greeted so friendly. Got seated right away and my server Derek is just pure awesome! He explained the entire menu so well that I wanted to eat everything. Although he say their skillets are a must try I decided to get their breakfast sandwich. Sandwich itself is very huge! It can definitely be shared with another person. I really liked the sandwich and Derek was so friendly and nice. I am definitely going to come back! Great job Hash staff!"}
{"text":"Pros:
The French toast is incredible!! Hands down, the best I've had! 

Cons: 
The service is awful. We hardly saw our waiter after we ordered. Our food was delivered by someone else & my drink was never refilled. 

The hash was just okay. It tasted like frozen potatoes you'd buy at the grocery store and my \"medium rare\" steak was extremely well done. 

The music is VERY loud inside. Definitely eat on the patio if you intend on having any sort of conversation."}
{"text":"What a gem. The Bloody Mary bar was outrageously delicious and had anything you could dream of. My girlfriend got the classic waffle which came out fluffy and delicious. As well as an over medium egg & a side of bacon. Egg & bacon were both cooked to perfection. I got the brisket over corn bread hash with 2 poached eggs which may make me fly into Phoenix on a Sunday morning just to get it all again. The servers were incredible as well. They were there when we needed them and were pleasant when we held them up with questions and overall thank yous. They also gave us great suggestions on our way out for other things to do while here! 10/10!"}
{"text":"Good food and good place for breakfast. Not so impressed by their coffee tho. Nice and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Usually I'm impatient and leave restaurants if they have a long wait, however I knew I wanted to stay here when I saw that Bloody Mary bar! The owner, Bonnie, and my mom hit it off when we walked in the door and she was so friendly. We went on a Sunday afternoon, there was a DJ and groups of people that were boozin. Our server was awesome and recommended to try Cristina's tamale cakes. It was one of the best meals I've had and my mom had the chicken & waffles. I love how fun the environment is and how tasty the food was :)"}
{"text":"Hash kitchen has been my favorite breakfast place since moving to scottsdale, lump crab Benny and any of the hashes are great. Taylor handled my pain in the butt family beautifully regardless of how busy it was and how new she was!"}
{"text":"Bonnie is awesome. I love love love this place!  Can't wait to visit again really soon."}
{"text":"Our first time here: busy Sunday morning, crowds of people waiting to get in. Luckily we were seated right away on their patio. Outdoor seating is a must if you don't want to be stuck inside listening to their loud DJ blasting music.. Server was friendly but annoyed. Didn't have the patience for us newcomers who didn't know the menu. 

We ordered 2 entries and a gluten free waffle. When they brought out the entrees, they gave us the wrong one at first and fixed their mistake within minutes.. 
Huevos rancheros hash was good, balanced flavors and the cilantro seared steak was tender. 
Sage fried chicken hash was greasy, flavorless, and had too much leeks. 
Gluten free waffle was delicious, best part of the meal. I would come back to eat it again. 

Side Note: 
* The biscuits are great, worth the extra calories! Moist, buttery goodness.
* The ladies that work up in the front are kind and energetic. They did a good job keeping up with the rush."}
{"text":"Quickly, coz I don't like to dwell in bad emotions. I will never go back to this place.  

Our favorite breakfast restaurant had a one-hour wait time on the Saturday morning of Memorial Weekend so we decided try The Hash instead. What a mistake!

They had a DJ who played really loud music. Annoyingly loud club music...and this is a breakfast restaurant. What's disconnect! So we asked to be seated outside where it was quieter. That's how the experience started. Bad omen! We ordered a frittata and a waffle. Both of which were very blend and completely lack taste. The service was lackluster. 

On a good note, the food was served really warm and the tea was fantastic. But, with dozen of breakfast location choices around the area, it's not going to be enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"We came into Hash Kitchen from out of town, and as if the food and Bloody Mary bar weren't enough, our waiter, Jesus was the frosting on the cake! Definitely recommend requesting Jesus as your waiter, he made our experience so great!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe that this used to be a massage place!  The interior is beautifully decorated and very spacious.  We had wonderful service from Bee and the food was as good as the service.  I had the Cubano and my mother-in-law had the Croque Madame.  Huge portions.  Can't wait to try more of the expansive menu and have another mimosa!"}
{"text":"We had not been here before but knew it to be well reviewed and popular. We hoped to sit outside and it is fortunate we could since the noise level inside would have driven us away.  Are diners unable to socialize so they need loud music to avoid the need to talk to each other?  This is the worst example but several other restaurants also play loud music. We avoid those places.  I tried the huevos ranchero hash: it was ok but seemed more a skillet than hash. One of our guests had a scramble which was wise: it was the only dish small enough for one person to finish.  My wife and our other guest had Croque madame and said it was great. Each got through half of their portion. They should have split a plate. The lemonade was great and the coffee ok.  The server was friendly and attentive.  Food was slow to arrive."}
{"text":"So not my scene, I was a little concerned when my husband and I walked in as it was more of an Old Town Scottsdale Sunday Funday vibe with a loud \"untzy\" DJ. We were just looking to have a casual brunch and the food and service totally made up for the ambiance. I can't turn down a good bloody mary bar, so I started with that and my husband had the Prosecco smash. The bloody mary bar is one of the best, there's a ton of options starting with different flavored vodkas from cilantro lime to bacon, flavored salt, pickled veggies galore, fried ravioli and even oysters! Since a bloody mary is pretty much a meal in a glass I chose the quinoa and couscous salad which was a perfect accompaniment. My husband went the other route and ordered the breakfast lasagna which was to die for! Our server was fantastic and very attentive, the bloody mary bar was amazing, and the food was delicious, all factors that make up for the super loud DJ. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Are you even kidding me with this place!?! LOVE IT!!! My family and I went on a very busy Sunday morning and at first I was upset that all the outside tables were taken. I was won over instantly by the incredible service and atmosphere!! A flight of mimosas, great food, and a DJ... I felt like I was on vacation! I love this place and I am so excited it is in our neighborhood!! We will be back very soon and hopefully with my lady friends to get drinks after hiking the McDowell Mountains!"}
{"text":"Beware coming here! We've been waiting 45 mins and every time we talk to the hostess she tells us that there's still people ahead of us. We saw people get out of there care 20 mins after us and they got seated first just because it was a bigger party. They also had multiple tables empty. Your time and money can be better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. I got the huevos rancheros hash. The potatoes and flavors were great. Our food came out at a relatively good time. However the 3 stars is really for the bar service. I know that weekends are typically busy, and I don't mind waiting. But the bartenders we obviously annoyed with us trying to order drinks while we waited. I hope my next experience is a lot better. Food is absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"Came with some friends for my Birthday lunch and we has a wonderful time. I had the Mexicana which had a great blend of flavors. Also the mimosa flight, which has a kiwi flavor today and was PHENOMENAL. 
Alyssa was a sweet server!
Can't wait till our next visit!"}
{"text":"This place is ahhhhmazing!! The Bloody Mary bar was so great - you can get as much on a skewer in your drink as you want! The service was amazing and Bonnie was the best. We had our food right away, and never waited for anything. I don't think we'll ever go anywhere else for brunch again!!!"}
{"text":"A fun experience and definitely worth a visit to try the \"make your own\" Bloody Mary bar.  Unfortunately the reviews we had read that said the food was tasteless were sadly accurate. I truly tried to be objective but the Eggs Benedict with Crab was bland, covering equally bland and dry biscuits. The waffles lean heavily on syrup for flavor.  It's telling when we observed a very nice hostess walking from table to table asking patrons if they needed more syrup and sauces instead of asking how they were enjoying their meals.   Fun for a one time visit but we won't be regulars."}
{"text":"Yaaaaa!! This place is awesome! Had bottomless mimosas on a Friday and loved it! I had the caprese eggs Benedict and HIGHLY suggest it! Also shared the banana French toast and biscuits and gravy for the table and everyone enjoyed it!! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Such a good vibe and delicious food. Our server Jesus was awesome. Diane came around too to check on us too"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome find.  The Bloody Mary bar with add ins like different types of olives, oysters, celery,meat sticks, banana peppers,pearl onions, bacon and extra items.   They have mimosa flights. The French toast melts in your mouth.  If you can visit her it is worth the wait !!! There is a wait of 30-45 mins to get in."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place! Great food, wonderful atmosphere and fantastic service. I believe going out to eat should be an experience and this place is just that. Evan was our server and was outstanding and Bonnie was so much fun. Will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!  I had the blackened shrimp roll.  It had just enough heat, lots of plump shrimp!  My friend had the caprese burger with sweet potato fries, which she couldn't finish.  My other friend had the Philly cheesesteak Panini with a side salad.  The service was outstanding!  Lot's of suggestions, which we appreciated.  We will go back for breakfast next time.  The décor was very relaxing,  nice and bright. Everything we saw being delivered to other patrons looked really good!  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Visited the Hash Kitchen twice on our trip to Scottsdale. On both visits we received service that went above and beyond, and that's not even getting into how good the food was!! Wow. Biggest portions and quite possibly the best breakfast I've ever had, and I'm a huge fan of breakfast so that's saying a lot. 

Pic is of the Huevos Rancheros Hash. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"We were so impressed with both the service and food!! We were sat quickly and our server was so friendly! Our party of 6, including 3 children, all enjoyed everything we ordered!! We can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"I was here last weekend with some girlfriends for brunch. We loved the food! I ordered Cristina's Tamale Cakes and we had a Brunch Bruschetta for the table. Both were great! 

The tamale cakes were such a unique twist on an eggs benedict dish. The sweet corn base was light and flavorful, and the green chili pork was SO tender and good. I think this dish was worth every penny, and wasn't too much food to leave me feeling like I'd overeaten!

The bruschetta was fun to eat. Three different types, each sweet and perfect to share. If it weren't so far from where I live, I'd be back more often! Although the restaurant was packed, we still had  reliable service. Looking forward to sitting inside next time, rather than outside in the desert summer air. For an extremely warm day, I was surprised that there weren't any misters on our side of the patio."}
{"text":"So yummy!! Mimosa flights are delicious! Half orders are possible if you aren't starving, and the scramblers are perfect! Bloody Mary bar to make your own concoction is such a fun idea too!"}
{"text":"First time visit and were totally impressed with the ambiance to begin with.  Add good food, great service, and awesome Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"wow - it's rare that a restaurant gets the poached eggs perfect AND the waffle perfectly crispy. the brisket was amazingly tender too! we are total breakfast snobs and I gave this 5 stars.  Bonnie at the front desk was friendly and Evan our water totally rocked the service!  oh and the Bloody Mary was great too :) (we didn't do the BMB, but it looked great)"}
{"text":"Wait too long.  Bloody Mary bar kept you busy.  

Asked for bacon free meal, brought it out with bacon.  Asked to remake, only took the bacon off the bread and reserved.  Disregard for religious beliefs....unacceptable."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Awesome food and a lively atmosphere. The breakfast menu has lots of good suggestions to try. It is an open restaurant and it reminds me of LA."}
{"text":"The best breakfast restaurant in Scottsdale, hands down. Wide, unique and versatile menu, outstanding service, exceptional bartenders, fun environment and the best Bloody Mary bar around. Caleb is the funniest and best :) definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"The service itself was good and the build your own bloody mary was delicious! I ordered the salmon eggs benedict and it was weirdly sweet.... And not in a good way.  I felt disgusted eating the dish. I believe it was the biscuit served with it. The biscuit tasted more like a pastry. My boyfriend ordered the hash huevos rancheros. The dish was bland in flavor and the biscuit was once again weirdly sweet. We also ordered french toast to share and that was good, once again really sweet but we ordered a sweet french toast so we got what we ordered. Would we come back to this place, no. The savory dishes are not savory and are lacking flavor. They are also weirdly sweet."}
{"text":"Yummy food!!! their BYO bloody mary bar is heaven!!!! I had their BBQ chicken sandwich which was so delicious! It's my favourite spot for brunch!"}
{"text":"Gino was a great server!! Had a blast. DJ was awesome. The lump crab sweet potato hash was the bomb and mimosa flight is the best way to go!!"}
{"text":"Visiting Arizona and found this place on Yelp...they have a live DJ and the environment is energetic!  The goodies delish and the service is amazing. Daniel was helping us and was as energetic as the music. Servers make the experience better and I left this place feeling better about life!  What a fun experience!  Thank you Daniel!"}
{"text":"We already love Hash Kitchen 1, so when this one opened we were excited since it is so much closer to our home.  The place seems larger than the other one and it has a large bar.  On our way there I was telling my husband that I was wondering if this location would be the same without Bonnie.  When we got there, surprise!!! Bonnie was there, decked to the nines as usual.  She greeted us and seated us at a quiet spot.  I decided not to get my favorite so I can try something else.  I had the Lump crap and sweet potato hash with over medium eggs, and my husband had the huevos rancheros hash.  Both were delicious.  Linda also stopped by and told us that Bonnie and her are going back and forth between the two locations.  I also had my guava mimosa, my new favorite.  I can't wait to come back, because I need to have some of the Cristina's tamale cakes."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast.  We went last week fairly early around 8 am.  The morning was nice and we decided to sit outside since inside it was like a fridge, super cold.  They have a couple of areas outside with a few tables.  The patios seem to be dog friendly, so we might come back with our neighbors dog when we are dog sitting.  I had the Cristina's tamale cakes, it had a corn tamale base and pulled pork with 2 perfectly poached eggs.  My husband had the Mexican Scrambler.  Service was prompt and efficient.  Can't wait to go back and try french toast or the waffles. 
I came back the following week and had the lemon ricotta pancakes, they were delicious but incredibly large portion.  Comes with cream cheese frosting, butter and maple reduction sides. Could barely eat half of the three pancakes portion.  I also had the mimosa flight, so awesome. Joe had the carnitas hash, super yummy.  I guess this is our new favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!  Came for Sunday brunch, food was fantastic with great service accommodating a party of 10.  S'mores French toast is amazing and the owner is really sweet.  Has to be one of the best brunch spots I've ever tried honestly, and I love my brunch.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool! It makes me feel like I am in a cool L.A like breakfast cafe. Though it is a lil chilly, it is made up by their amazing brunch cocktails."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Lively atmosphere and a live DJ. Our waiter Xavier was a delight! We will be returning just to get him again because he's so great. He's what made it a 5 star experience for sure."}
{"text":"I kinda feel like the Arizona Restaurant Association is spying on me.  They always seem to come up with promotions that are a virtual lock to lure me into one of their member's restaurants.  The bi-annual Arizona Restaurant Week is of course a fantastic way to try out some of AZ's more high end restaurants at a reasonable discount.  And now for the second year, they unveil their Arizona Breakfast Weekend.  Last year this promotion got me in the door of Original Breakfast House, a simple place with extraordinary food and way over-the-top friendly staff.  This year, I decided to use the discount promotion to try Hash Kitchen for the first time.  Saturday at opening, let's eat.

Hash's Scottsdale Rd & Doubletree Ranch location (southeast corner) was the closest of Hash's locations to my apartment so I came here.  Its on the far south side of the plaza (almost a block directly south of Pomo).  The restaurant is pretty sizable and can probably accommodate somewhere between 100-150 people at full capacity.  Maggiore Culinary Concepts (proprietors of several AZ & CA restaurant concepts including Tomaso's) is the brainchild of this restaurant.  When a true blood Italian like Joey Maggiore is running the show, it should come as no surprise that many of the signature menu items have an Italian tilt.  With items like cannoli pancakes, brunch bruschetta, and breakfast lasagna, its clear what kind of family runs the operation.  But the overall menu is pretty robust in other areas as well with items like croque madame, chilaquiles, brioche french toast, custom frittatas, and even chicken & waffles.

For AZ Breakfast Weekend, I stuck to the promotional offer for my first visit.  For $15 you get a house mimosa, a cannoli donut, and your choice of one of 5 main dishes.  Since this is the \"Hash\" kitchen after all, I decided on something with a Mexican flare.  The Carnitas Hash.  Pulled pork braised in Mexican Coke, hash potatoes, cotija cheese, roasted corn, avocado, green chili, cilantro, crema, and fried onions.  Also comes with a couple of warm corn tortillas on the side.  Including tax and tip the total cost for breakfast came to $20.  How'd the food measure up?

First the Mimosa.  A respectable, simple and classic drink.  Admittedly I'm more into some of the newer innovative takes on mimosas, but Hash's classic mimosa gets the job done.  Next, the cannoli donut.  Basically what you have here is a cinnamon flavored donut with cannoli filled in the middle and the donut hole on top and covered in powdered sugar.  I've never had something like this before and boy what a shame that is.  That cannoli filling was a ridiculously good accompaniment and I made sure I didn't leave any cinnamon or cannoli behind on this dish.  Definitely worth the indulgence.  Lastly, the hash.  And this thing was a monster!  There had to be close to a pound and a half of food in that skillet.  TONS of that pulled pork and a generous helping of eggs (I got mine scrambled).  Get a fork full of pork, avocado, eggs, and potatoes in one bite and I was on cloud nine.  A rich, hearty, hugely flavorful breakfast dish that eats like dinner.  For most people this dish would be sharable for two.  I made a couple of breakfast tacos out of it with the corn tortillas, but honestly the dish stands up proudly on its own.

I've heard the Bloody Mary Bar is a pretty big draw here, but I was honestly too full to give it a second thought (or a first for that matter).  Had I been here on a normal day, the total for the food and drink I ordered, plus tax and tip would've been closer to $35 (though Hash does offer 5% off your total with a Yelp Check In).  That said I probably wouldn't have docked any points even at that price.  The food quality was superb, the portions were more than generous and the staff (particularly at the bar where I sat) were excellent.  Just as with Original Breakfast House last year, I got a great deal thanks to the discount promotion.  So what did we learn today, kids?  Answer:  Don't EVER skip out on Arizona Breakfast Weekend."}
{"text":"My go to for a breakfast spot!! They have an amazing Bloody Mary bar as well as very accommodating staff. We hosted a breakfast the day before a girlfriends wedding, they gave us a perfect table to accommodate our decor and great service!"}
{"text":"You would think a restaurant that is only open for breakfast and lunch would  be prepared. Not today at Hash Kitchen at Gainey. More than half of the items on the Bloody Mary bar were empty, and the items not refilled. Tacky. One of my friends ordered the flight of mimosas, and was told sorry, we are out of champagne. Unacceptable for a Sunday brunch place. The service was slow, and the food mediocre. French Toast was raw inside, scrambled eggs were non-descript. Our coffee wasn't refilled. All in all, not a great experience. Another Hash Kitchen is coming to my neighborhood at 44th St and Indian School. I hope the manager of the new location has their act more together."}
{"text":"The place was kind of hard to find but when I did, I walked into a gorgeous place. The dining area was very welcoming, the place was nicely decorated and the hostess was such a sweet lady. Loved her purple shoes! 

My girl friend and I waited not to long for water and drinks. The Bloody Mary is a must have. Next time I'm going to be brave and attempt making a creation of my own. Amazingly they had a Bloody Mary bar aside from the full bar in the other room! 

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros Hash and the red haired young gal took our order. I forgot her name. We had to 32min, yes we timed it before she took our order, the placed was not busy. We use an app that times out service and based on the wait it determines our tip! She did not score high at all :( It looked so yummy but on the first bite the meat in it was cold and had a weird taste then the sauce itself was so bland. I never send food back but this was not worth trying to swallow :( I was so sad as I LOVE Huevos Rancheros. The server did noticed and kindly suggested the pancakes so I ordered the carrot cake. Now that dish was pure heaven!!!! 

Would I go back? Yes. I would try s different HASH but if that fails, I will just stick to the sweets and bloody Mary's!  I gave 4stars due to the servers acknowledgement and bringing me something yummy instead, the sweet lady up front and the kick ass blood's. Oh yeah and I have her more tip then the app suggested for her recommendation of the yummy carrot cakes.The good out weighed the bad... Please HASH KITCHEN, retrain servers on timing. Timing is of essence. Thank you ;)"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and excellent service! Can't go wrong with any of the breakfast hashes. Bonnie was very welcoming. Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"This is a happening place. Live DJ music, large TV screens, bright wall decor, charming table settings, cushioned seats, various seating options - tables, booths, counter, long high tables. 

It's vegetarian friendly, our group had the vegetarian scrambled, vegetarian fritatta. We had the banana split French toast for those that prefer that (see pics). Good food, reasonable prices. Very friendly servers too. One can't help feeling upbeat dining here."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere but the only\"champagne\"
offering is the cheapest horrible tasting stuff, and they charge $20 per bottle for a $3 brand if bought in a store. They could easily offer something better and in this area it would sell. Also, the hash browns at the hash kitchen are frozen potatoes that are tasteless. On a positive note the frittatas are good, as well as the lemon ricotta pancakes. 
\""}
{"text":"Bonnie. Bonnie is the hostess with the mostess. From start to finish she was making sure our experience was the best. Bartender was very attentive. Food was delicious could use a little more chick with chicken and waffles but the chicken was very tender and the corn bread waffle was the best. 

Can't wait until next time."}
{"text":"Love this place, the best food, the best bloody Mary bar, and the staff is so nice:)  Anytime I get together with friends we always go here.."}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes for a table, very noisey couldnt converse with company very well , Bloodymary Bar out of alot of condiments...Overated"}
{"text":"This is absolutely one heck of a solid breakfast. Pictured from this review is the corn beef hash skillet. Hands down, excellent. Portions are perfect and neither under or overwhelming. Everything was cooked perfectly. There's nothing else to say. Interior design is attractive and if your into bloody marry's then this might be your new favorite spot. Very impressed and content after this breakfast."}
{"text":"I've read many great reviews....so was excited to try it today.  The Bloody Mary bar is awesome and a fun experience.  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the food.  We ordered the Smoked Brisket breakfast and the Corned Beef Hash.  Both were bland with no flavoring.  No salt, pepper or herb/spice on either.  Even the fresh baked biscuit was bland. The Corn Bread Hash was uninspired and mushy.   Very sorry to say but We were very disappointed."}
{"text":"When I saw the Hash Kitchen on the Arizona Breakfast Weekend list, I decided it was time to finally make my first visit.  The Hash Kitchen is co-owned by chef Joey Maggiore and his wife Cristina Maggiore of Maggiore Culinary Concepts (who also own Tomaso's Italian Restaurant and Tommy V's Osteria Pizzeria). They seek to \"reimagine breakfast classics with creative remixes\". This location is located in the beautiful Gainey Ranch area. The atmosphere was very inviting right when we first walked in as several people welcomed us before we were sat (we didn't wait long either). Their popular build-your-own Bloody Mary bar (claimed to be Arizona's largest) with their many garnishes and bacon-infused vodka is the first thing you see as you walk in. The bacon on a stick was calling to me as I passed by it. To start off, each of us in our party ordered a specialty coffee drink. The breakfast week menu consisted of an entrée, a classic mimosa and a cannoli donut. The donut was a nice little treat to pair with my coffee and comes fried to order. I ordered the Carnitas Hash - a cast-iron skillet filled with potatoes, roasted corn, tender pork carnitas, avocados, two eggs and a heap of crispy onions (and a couple of corn tortillas). It had a nice hint of spiciness and was just as good as it sounds. The portion sizes here are pretty generous and I had plenty to take home to eat later. Overall this was a pleasant experience and I hope next time to partake in the Bloody Mary Bar. I'm excited to check out their Chandler area location (down the street from me) when it opens."}
{"text":"Had carnitas hash which was great! Service was horrible. This spot was decided on for girls brunch. 3 of us ordered traditional bloody Mary's but the waiter put us down for the Bloody Mary bar. When we told him we actually just wanted the traditional he looked at me and said \"ok\" very rudely and grabbed the ticket up off the table and walked off. The wait just to get our drinks was forever! I asked for a water as well and waited forever for that as well. When the food was brought out we asked for an extra set of silverware because we were short one. That took forever as well as my food sit in front of me getting cold. Needless to say our waiter did not return for refills or just to make sure we were doing ok. The next time we saw him was to bring our ticket so he made it an easy choice at that point to change locations to continue our brunch time."}
{"text":"Best experience for Sunday Brunch! Bonnie is awesome! The food is amazing the jumbo shirmp and sweet potatoes and veggie scramble. Make sure you try the flight of mimosas and the bloody mary bar. Nice vibe and music. Such and great menu and so much more I plan to try. Bonnie I will be back!"}
{"text":"Not a great place for kids. Loud DJ and there was an extremely long wait for food. Waiter didn't even put in my one daughters order which was very frustrating. Definitely an adult place for a lazy weekend morning. Food was average."}
{"text":"Holy moly if you're looking for a boozy brunch this is the new spot. DJ on the weekend, packed house, long Bloody Mary line. 

Cool atmosphere. There is another location at Frank Lloyd Wright and Thompson Peak by Safeway. Have not checked that one out yet. The owner was dancing in the aisles which was cool to see! 
Worth checking out if brunch is your thing!"}
{"text":"I got the huevos rancheros hash and bottomless mimosas, everything was so good. The entree came with so much food I had to take half home! The bartender was really nice and helped my out by giving me some extra beans in replacement of the meat. Everyone else who worked there seemed super friendly. The first guy who brought a water to me kept refilling my water everytime it was empty and made sure I was doing ok everytime. Great atmosphere. I'll have to try the build your own Bloody Mary bar next."}
{"text":"I loved the hyped up environment. The Bloody Mary bar looked tasty until I got it I am pretty sure it was the flavor I choose because everyone else was enjoying there's. We were super excited to try out their unique menu and ordered two plates each. However, once we got the actual plates the food was not too flavorful and pretty bland. So disappointed because the place is fun to be around. Maybe we were there in a bad timing, because all of the reviews say otherwise."}
{"text":"Great Service, Yummy food, 
Try the Chilaquiles!!!
Love this place..
I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"They have a real problem
Tried to have breakfast there and was told there was a 30 minute wait although there were several open tables they said kitchen was running slow
I am not impressed they are going to need to step it up if they plan to succeed as for me I will not return"}
{"text":"Did breakfast just become a reason the reason for me to pull out my old club hopping clothes?! I think it just might have! Call me a bad Yelper but instead of reading a few reviews for The Hash House I just saw the pictures of the great looking food and decided I needed to try everything asap!! Little did I know I was walking in to The Breakfast CLUB. For real!! The DJ Spinning, the mimosa flights flowing, and that Bloody Marry Bar... dude... that thing is no joke!! 

It has been some time since I have gone to breakfast/brunch, so I was a real dumb dumb thinking I was going to take me and my friends out to a nice brunch on a Sunday afternoon with no wait. Who do I think I am!? Thank god for the good tunes the DJ was spinning (Yea that's right, apparently on Sunday's they get real lit with DJ playing all your favorite jams.) The massive Bloody Marry Bar, where I had a bacon infused vodka, with all kinds of goodies, including a giant meatball. Which I have to say was the best dang meatball I have ever had. (I don't have much experience with meatball's so give me a bit of a break.) And of course with the help of some great company the hour flew by pretty fast. 

Our table of 6 was sat in the cute dinning area and promptly greeted by our server. We had already had drinks, but we knew we wanted to start off with those Cannoli Donuts. They were snatched up and devoured right away. I got a full order (Protip: you can do 1/2 order of most of their entree's. These are pretty large plates. 1/2 order is like a normal amount of food haha.) or the Carrot Cake Pancakes. I was actually a little disappointed in these. They were delicious but they just did not taste much like a Carrot anything. And I was missing my cream cheese frosting. If it were there, I had no idea. The pancakes were still perfect though. Fluffy, buttery, with the maple reduction, topped with those crispy Sweet Potatoes, it was still a great dish. My husband had the Lump Crab Benedict. I got to try a few bites. Very good, tons of crab, lots of flavor. And I also got a few bites of the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. Unlike the Carrot Cake, I was definitely able to get the Lemon flavor of these babies. I washed everything down with a great cup of coffee. 

The only problem we had was our bill. We sat about 20-25 minutes at the end of our meal. We had things that we had asked to get boxes for, we had asked for 3 checks and then I think he forgot about us. Really I think he just thought we had already cashed out. It happens. I'm not mad. But it did damper the experience a bit. But besides that we really had a great time and wonderful meals. Next time I'm dusting my club clothes off and going to make a day out of this fun breakfast place. Cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"Great new neighborhood breakfast/brunch location.  Loved the atmosphere, bright and jovial!
So glad you opened a 2nd location!  We love the original at Gainey Ranch.
Food was made to order, delicious, and delivered with a smile. We had the lamb hash  with perfectly cooked poached eggs and a classic Belgium waffle with berries. Everything was great!
We can't wait to come back and try more from the menu."}
{"text":"We've been here twice when down in Scottsdale visiting family, and, I have to say, it's the closest I've found to a proper Wisco Bloody Mary in AZ. The MYO Bloody Mary bar isn't cheap at $11, but you can choose from about six house-infused vodkas, and three mixes, and then there's a garnish bar of literally 30 items from olives and limes, to cactus and pickled eggs, to bacon and smoked cheese. The only thing missing is the de rigueur beer chaser, which our server was surprised to hear is a thing in WI.

Oh, and the food menu is great, too. Overwhelming, with too many good choices, but that's an okay problem to have. Service has always been attentive, genuine and friendly. Don't go on a Sunday if you don't have the patience to wait for quite a while. Weekdays are much quieter. Great spot, though. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Waited 5 mins for a table and was able to enjoy a Bloody Mary bar. The young lady was very friendly and let us know they infused all their own vodka and allowed us to garnish our Marys just the way we liked them. Food was delicious I ordered the breakfast burrito and my friend had the carnitas hash. The service was great and the price point was right on. We were staying at the hotel across the street. Great Brunch spot"}
{"text":"Great new spot in North Scottsdale!  The chiliqulias, and biscuits were fantastic!  Great Bloody Mary bar and ambience.  The ravioli was mediocre but could be improved."}
{"text":"First time here for my husband and I and we will DEFINITELY be back. We got here around 9:30am on Sunday and it wasn't too busy yet so we were seated right away. Our server Evan was awesome and the food and coffee were amazing. A DJ started at about 10:30am and the place was alive with music - a little hip hop, some reggae, all good. It has a very New York vibe, seems a lot of folks that run the place are east coasters and they have a unique spin on breakfast and ambiance. You should give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Had a delightful first visit to hash kitchen.  Fabulous atmosphere, a happy place, delicious hash and eggs, going to try French toast next weekend and excellent service from Bee! Jf"}
{"text":"My experience at Hash Kitchen was phenomenal. The servers and the manager were very caring and made sure that our experience was exceptional. The food and ambience was greatly satisfying. My family and I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Great place for drinks, good laughs, ohh and the breakfast is outstanding! Won't be disappointed, but maybe a bit chubby when you leave (:"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot in all of Scottsdale. Super cool staff, live DJ on the weekends and the best drinks + food. Lona is the best (if you get your say in where you sit) and always hooks us up with her favorite HK specialties. Great spot, great staff, good eats!!"}
{"text":"Best bloody Mary bar everrrrrrr!!!! Food is delicious! Only complaint is that the music is crazy loud on the weekends and when I took my parents and in laws here they seemed a little uncomfortable because they were screaming at one another when trying to communicate. Overall highly recommended - get a bloody!!!!!"}
{"text":"Oops it looked so good that I forgot to take a picture. Today I had a new offering - the aphrodisiac oyster hash. Very good but the eggs Benedict with crab meat is still my #1 favorite. This place is so good for breakfast that I will have to make a point of trying lunch here.  Oh FYI they brew a great pot of coffee too"}
{"text":"Let me premise this by saying the food was delicious. However the service was not very good for it only being tuesday afternoon, only 6 or so tables with customers and having a few waitresses. I tend to be very patient and understanding of what a waitress goes thru. However, our waitress, Katy, did not even take our order we flagged down another waitress after waiting a good 15 min for her to acknowledge us. I normally would not complain about the amount of times a waitress comes but I sat there and watched her go to her other tables 2-3 times and actually converse with them. Meanwhile she had only come to our table once. I finally got up to get the manager to let him know our table was completely ignored and before I could finish my sentence he turned around walked away from me and got our waitress. She came back to the table with our check and did not ask if we needed anything. My mom had to ask her not to go just yet and if  she could  bring us to go boxes. Although the manager was polite he did not ask what he could do to remedy the situation or what we needed. We visited the other Hash Kitchen and on a busy Sunday morning and we received better service than this location. First time in my life I did not leave a tip. Like I said I have a great deal of patience and understanding for what waitresses do but we were flat out ignored compared to her other tables. That combined with the  rude behavior from the manager, I will not be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"I went here after my wedding this past Saturday and the service was amazing!!! We had a party of 30 and it did take a little while to get everyone seated but Bonnie was a sweetheart the entire time we were there. We did not make reservations so we understood and were very patient. She kept checking in on us and making sure that we were ok while we waited and some of us sat at the bar until a bigger table was ready. The red grapefruit mimosas were SO good! The French toast and poached eggs were excellent! The food was excellent overall, the music kept us entertained and my family and friends had a ball!!! Bonnie, we love you and we will be back! Thank you for everything! Xoxo"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The smores French toast was unbelievable while the frittata was fresh and tasty. I highly recommend Hash!"}
{"text":"Yeah. I was so excited to try this place. I love hash.. And didn't even realize the amazing pancake options. We were greeted by friendly staff and were welcomed in the entrance with a very impressive bloody mary bar... Too bad I don't like bloody marys. Oh well. Seated. Ordered. Both of us tried hashes. I was torn between pancakes and hash, but I felt I should go with the restaurants name sake should be the item to try first. It only makes sense... But oh those pancakes... Ugh. And then it was down hill. The restaurant was pretty quiet so it wasn't like our server was overwhelmed. Literally watched the employee gossip unfold as I stared at my empty coffee cup. I dramatically drained my last tiny drop to kinda say hey.... This is a breakfast place and coffee should be free flowing.... But no. The coffee was on lock down. Hmm. Not happy. This girl wants hot coffee and without getting plenty of refill options the points drop. Then food comes out. It looks good, sounds fancy for hash, and looks like plenty to eat. Oh wait.. The biscuits that come with the meal are still cooking. Oh OK. Sounds good. Doesn't matter anyway.. I have no coffee. So it takes half a meal to get hot sauce. The biscuits were forgotten and the moment she remembered she had just picked up the coffee pot and I thought my dreams were coming true... Then she put it down to go get biscuits. Basically my hash was lacking the flavors the menu described. I finally was able to get more coffee at the last bite of my meal. I didn't eat meat if my potatoes because they were bland. And the biscuits... No butter. No jelly or jam. They had a sweet light coating on them... But it wasn't enough to make me want to eat the. I was pretty disappointed. However I will probably go back one more time to try for better service and the pancakes... Because they do sound good. Hopefully round two will have some kinks worked out."}
{"text":"So I absolutely adored The Hash! I went for the first time on my birthday and I have to say they get an A++ for customer service!!! 

They brought out the incorrect dish for my friend but immediately resolved it by being remorseful , offering to remake it, and brought out some additional items to make up for it! We appreciated that!!! 

The lovely lady that is hosting is absolutely a hoot! She was so friendly and funny and kept checking on us!! She was great and shared many stories and photos! I'll go back just to chat with her! 

The staff came and sang me happy birthday and brought a delicious fresh donut for me as a birthday treat!! 

The drinks were great! And the Bloody Mary bar is a sight to see!! The place was packed and that's always a great sign!! So excited for our return trip to The Hash!! Best breakfast experience in AZ by far! 

Thank you The Hash!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the huevos rancheros hash and it was sooooo good. Would definitely come back and order the exact same thing. It's huge though...I couldn't finish even close to all the potatoes so make sure to come hungry!!

I went fairly early on a Saturday..maybe around 9:15 or 9:30 and I think about an hour into our meal a DJ set up and started playing really loud dance music. I didn't mind it at all, but just a heads up that it's not chill breakfast spot once the rowdy brunch crowd comes in!

Taking one star off because they ran out of coffee mugs and served us coffee in to-go mugs LOL. They came back with real mugs later, it's just a little odd...although the waiter assured us they were getting a shipment of more mugs on Monday."}
{"text":"Obsessed with the Benny's and the bloody mary bar! The lady at the front is always so welcoming and sweet (i wish i could remember her name) She always remembers me and my pup ! She even brings her her own bowl and water glass :)"}
{"text":"Just went for the BYOBM Bar (make your own Bloody Mary bar) and it was awesome!!! So many toppings and different flavors of vodka!"}
{"text":"We came in on a Thursday around noon...which I'm sure was a great decision because no wait!! Bloody Mary bar...mimosa flight...and good food..can't ask for anything more! We got a veggie and Mexican scramble, strawberry banana French toast, and biscuits and gravy. We loved it all and would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Half breakfast restaurant, half club, all terrible.  Long wait with no space, awful service, over cooked everything but eggs (they were undercooked), and just overall bad experience.  Was told it was Arizona breakfast weekend, so that may contribute to them being bad at everything, but no chance I'll be back to try. Clearly this trendy club breakfast bs is not for me."}
{"text":"Food was really good and I like the decor.  Have to admit that I had been more impressed at the N. Scottsdale location on FLW/Thompson Peak.  I ordered the same meal, and there (at FLW/Thompson Peak)  I got a really fresh, warm biscuit with my Hash Frittata and at the Gainey Ranch location, my biscuit was dry, cold and crumbly.  Could have been flukes at both locations....  Wouldn't keep me from trying Gainey Ranch location again.   We met another couple there, and he is a real hash lover.  He liked it!  Winner!  My husband really liked the Carnitas Hash at the FLW location.  At Gainey Ranch, he had the Chorizo Hash, and while it was good, he prefers the Carnitas Hash."}
{"text":"This was our first visit, upon arrival we were greeted by Amy who was very welcoming. We were seated at a table and waited quite a while for a server. After a bit the manager, Evo showed up and pretty much made for a horrible visit. Due to a special diet, we specifically ordered our meals with NO potatoes and asked if we could have fruit instead. The only fruit he offered was melon, of which we couldn't have. Moments later we saw several bowls of berries going by.
We had to wait and wait just to get coffee, we finally asked another server for some. Aprielle then became our server - I believe she was also doing double duty as bartender to the Bloody Mary bar, yet still managed to take care of us. She was very pleasant and tried to fix what Evo messed up.
When our food arrived it came with the potatoes that we were very clear about not wanting on our plates. I flagged down Evo and told him and also asked about all of the berries we saw going by, he told us that those were for children only! WHAT? Are you kidding me? Later we asked Aprielle about this, she said no and offered to bring us some. We declined as we were finished eating and a bit upset about the lack of knowledge and customer service provided by the manager.
We may not return, especially if we see Evo on duty."}
{"text":"A very popular joint loaded with people.  Come and try some of their popular brunch entrees.   This is a great place for tourists with tons of energy.  I liked that the dishes were not too huge or too salty."}
{"text":"They have horrible customer service. We called to ask for reservations and were told we couldn't make reservations, when we walked in they asked us why we didn't not make a reservation. After waiting 45 minutes we were told we could sit directly in the sun or wait another 50 minutes. We would have loved to had the food and given them our $500 bill but we will take our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I got one of the better huevos rancheros skillets I've ever had here.  The red chili was awesome and the plate didn't become an unappetizing pile of mush thanks to a crispy tortilla in the middle and the fried onions on top.  The meat that was supposed to be carne asada though left very much to be desired.  It looked and unfortunately tasted kind of like the steak they use at taco bell but sliced thinner.. 

My friend got the biscuits and gravy which was not very interesting.  You get like 3 lump biscuits in a pool of gravy.  Honestly, I've had better at a hospital cafeteria.

The service was pretty good.  Everyone was nice and asked how everything was.  It started getting old towards the end of the meal, maybe add in a few other lines they can say or just skip the question every other time...?  They were pretty good about refilling water and coffee, etc though so can't complain too much. 

The bloody mary bar looked awesome!  We're definitely going to have to go back  one day to try lunch and the bloody mary bar."}
{"text":"I met a coworker here for lunch last week and opted to enjoy their breakfast menu.  The chorizo and mushroom sweet potato hash with sunny side up eggs and a side of fruit was perfect.  Our server was great and didn't seem to mind that we were special ordering off of the menu.  The atmosphere is nice, the staff is very welcoming and the food is top notch too."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! It was like being on vacation! We were greeted by the nicest, most sincere hostess, Amy, & seated on a very lovely & CLEAN patio! I love frittatas & this might have been the best frittata ever, (The Art Mollen Frittata with artichoke hearts & spinach). Taylor was a terrific waitress, too. Although they're only open for breakfast & lunch, I'm hoping that they consider staying open for dinner. This was a truly unexpected treat! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Run to the Hash Kitchen and get yourself to the Bloody Mary Bar!! 

Great atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff, and superb food! 

Loved this place! My dad and I went for Sunday Brunch after a beautiful morning hike and it was just what we needed to re-energize! 

The Bloody Mary bar was top notch! So many choices and all so tasty! I would really go back just for endless cocktails.

I got the Huevos Rancheros Skillet and dad got Chicken and Waffles and I discovered looking around, you really can't make a bad decision! Be warned as our waiter did for us: you WILL be in a good coma after your visit!"}
{"text":"Don't walk, run! This place rocks.  I don't write many reviews but the professionally trained staff attentive service fabulous food world-class bloody Mary bar separates this from all the other breakfast joints in Scottsdale.  The greeter, bar staff and personable, attentive waiter were all excellent."}
{"text":"Bonnie, the host was a sweetie. So friendly and helpful. Sadly, We sat outside and felt forgotten. Our waitress barley came around and when we she did we could barely get a word in- she was in and out. We had to order our meal at the bar while we were getting our amazing Bloody Marys at the Bloody Mary bar. 

The Bloody Mary bar is fun and filled with lots of fun snacks you can load your drink with. It's a must. 

We are the salmon frittata- it was amazing. So tasty and enough for 2 people to share. 

We had an amazing experience, but our waitress was MIA for most of the time. I wound have given it 5 stars otherwise."}
{"text":"This place is popping! Not only do they have a blood Mary bar, but there is a dj right when you walk in. I can see how it might be a little too loud sitting on the inside,but outside was perfect The blood Mary bar is awesome; not only can you pick your own flavored vodka, but there are a ton of toppings. We sat at the patio bar, it was a little chilly, but I can see on a nice day it would be perfect! Manager, Brent, helped us out and make sure that we had everything we needed. The bar is super clean. The food serving was more than enough and delicious. Great customer service. I would definitely come back when we are in town. This place is popping."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local breakfast spot (my wife's is Butters).  There is almost nothing traditional on the menu, but that's what I love about it.  Like most breakfast places, the portions are large.  They also seem to mix up the menu fairly frequently with new items.  They will tell you that they are known for their hashes (duh), and the ones I've had have been great.  But their other stuff has been terrific too.

They also have the most elaborate bloody mary bar if you are into that.  Plus, they usually have a DJ spinning.  I remember the first time I was there listening to Warren G followed by Red Hot Chili Peppers while eating a delicious breakfast and thinking that this is my spot.

Lastly, the service has always been terrific!!  Super nice staff."}
{"text":"Having had a great experience at the other more chic location, this one disappointed.  Upon entering I noticed how plain it looked in comparison.  Seemed like just a bunch of tables in a bare room when there really was some subtle decor.  The Bloody Mary bar was off to the side and nowhere near as impressive.  There is still a DJ playing loud music in front of a wall of hanging tea cups - the only neat decor. 

More importantly is the food which was mediocre.  While I liked my crab cake Benedict at the Scottsdale Rd location, my fried chicken Benedict here was way too dry - both the chicken and the English muffin.  I tried the thicker French toast this time and that was as good as the thinner coconut almond one.  No complaints there."}
{"text":"Today my husband and I had brunch at Hash Kitchen. We were greeted at the door by the nicest blonde lady who gives the sweetest compliments!! CJ was our server.  Be sure to try their Bloody Mary Bar!! It was fantastic!!! It had every ingredient under the sun!!The kitchen was quite backed up and our food was rather late.  CJ brought us complimentary biscuits and meatballs!  Very nice touch!!! CJ and Linda the manager came over to apologize, and to tell us our meal was being comped. What could have been an unpleasant dining experience was turned in a GREAT one!! Linda then brought us a complimentary fruit tray!  Class Act!!! Our food was delicious but our customer service was stellar!!! Great Job Hash Kitchen!!"}
{"text":"What more can I say about Hash Kitchen? A group of 5 of us ladies came for boozy brunch to celebrate a Bachelorette and had a great experience. From the service (thanks for everything Bonnie!) to the delicious food & bottomless mimosas. Our favorites were the Carnitas Hash, chicken & Waffles, & lump crab hash but everything was exceptionally good. Looking forward to coming back the next time I'm back on the west coast."}
{"text":"This was a really fun atmospheric Resturant.. its loud and the people are having a good breakfast along with good bloody Mary's and mimosas!
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest, i think this is my FIRST one star review ever. I have always looked at the 1 stars at a restaurant with great reviews and now I've learned my lesson. Every review matters.

My husband and I came on Valentine's Day and were pretty excited based on the pics and fellow Yelp reviews...we will not be back. 

The wait was expected 30-40 minutes in our opinion was actually really really good considering the day and the area. 

We were seated at the bar as the hostess asked if it was ok, which we were fine with, give a table to a family or someone under 21. No biggie.

My husband opted for the 'build your own' Bloody Mary bar and i opted for the house/bartender makes it for me Bloody Mary, it would have to be just as good if not better than his, right? WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Ok so the hubs makes his own drink and I literally wait 20 minutes for mine. Not kidding. Then finally when she brings me my drink she then takes our order....which doesn't come out for nearly 45 minutes. No apologies, no eye contact, no how's your drink, you haven't touched but I see you sipping off of your man's.

Ok so what was wrong with it? You know when the mix isn't stirred/shaken and the good stuff is all at the bottom? Yeah, I didn't get the good stuff or the garnishes. 

Kudos to the blond bartender working the other side of the bar who checked on her waiting patrons and offered to comp a drink if they would like another while they waited. I wish you were our waitress because service is half of a review. 

Our food was mediocre. I had the chicken and waffles which had absolutely no flavor...the hubs had the Boring Bennie and the biscuit instead of the English muffin was actually genius.

All in all the wait For food and poor service is what this review comes down too. 

**DO NOT SIT AT THE BAR**"}
{"text":"What a poor experience!  Overpowering, loud disco music for breakfast!  I could not wait to get out of the place.  Food was good, service was slow.  Certainly not a place to go if there is any expectation of visiting with those with you.  Ugh!"}
{"text":"Food  was amazing the service was great the problem was with the dishes the glasses seems like they have been washed by a wet dog there was a foul odor either the water was dirty or the towel used to dry them was filthy"}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for three days and ate every morning at the hash kitchen.  All I can say is WOW.  I had the coconut almond French toast, the sweet potato hash with eggs topped with crab and hollandaise sauce and the Eggs Benedict.  Amazing these people take breakfast to a whole new level .  And that Bloody Mary bar it's like a candy store for Bloody Mary's  it's amazing and the staff is fantastic too .  Thank you Gino and Pat"}
{"text":"It was A great restaurant for brunch we had really good service Jessie was awesome our server.  Linda the general manager is awesome.  The coffee is high quality and the chilaquiles are great"}
{"text":"Way too loud on weekends! Phenomenal food with a side of tinnitus. If a DJ blaring in your ear is ambient for you, then this place is perfect. I want to love this place more, but it's uncomfortable on the weekends. 
During the week, perfect. I'll raise my rating once they fix their noise issues."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  Delicious hashes, benedicts, and French toast.  Coffee is outstanding as well.  I don't drink, but the Bloody Mary bar looked pretty on-point.  I had the carnitas hash when we visited, and it was ridiculous.  My party also had the corn tamale Benedict, lump crab and sweet potato hash, and banana split French toast.  Everybody loves their choices.  Also a fun atmosphere, with a live DJ providing the soundtrack."}
{"text":"Love trying new breakfast joints and The Hash Kitchen did not disappoint! Great food, great service! Need I say more!"}
{"text":"Hash Kitchen is soooooo delicious! On the weekend they have a DJ and the Bloody Mary bar is amazing, , This is not your regular bloody Mary bar it has everything from horseradish to oysters to bacon and every type of condiment in between. If you don't like bloody Mary's they also have mimosa flights which looked amazing. I had the huevos rancheros hash which was served with over medium eggs and Carne Asada! The service was great, food was out fast."}
{"text":"Hash kitchen is such a cute little brunch spot, they have very unique hash skillets, mimosa flights, an incredible bloody Mary bar with several different toppings, and they have a DJ on the weekends, it's like a club in the morning. Just be prepared for a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"They won't take reservations or call aheads and the music is too loud, you cannot talk or hear anyone... it's like a rave.  It would be better if it was less loud, because you want to make sure customers can interact."}
{"text":"Extremely hip an a rare find. House music going during breakfast will definitely wake you up!  Best Bloody Mary bar I've ever been to. Can't wait to go back for my next breakfast."}
{"text":"Had a late breakfast Saturday food was amazing! Only downfall was the service very slow and it wasn't even busy ? Our waitress only came back to our table once that was after our food was served . She didn't even ask to refill our drinks ."}
{"text":"Not only is the food delicious, the customer service was excellent! I visited Scottsdale on my bachelorette trip with about 12 other girls! I called ahead (a week or so) and made a reservation! Upon arrival we were seated and treated like belles of the ball! Everyone was so friendly! The vibe of the restaurant was awesome with great music and a BYO Bloody Mary Bar! All my friends were happy and thoroughly enjoyed the place! Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My husband and I came here for a Sunday morning breakfast. This place must be very popular, it was really busy. The vibe is great and the music is fun. I love the build your own Bloody Mary Bar. It is like a mini appetizer with all the stuff I added to it, and was delicious! The Carnitas Hash is awesome! We will be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick drink. Pursued the menu. Some interesting breakfast items that I will try when  I am hungrier. The Bloody Mary's were delicious. They close early so you need to get there before 3pm."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this restaurant for brunch!  Outstanding Bloody Mary bar and OMG, the Banana Split French Toast was to die for!  I really like that they offer 1/2 orders of pancakes and French toast!  A 1/2 order was too much for me!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Wow! The service was amazing and the atmosphere was great! We were greeted by an owner (I think) and promptly seated. Our server asked if we'd been in before (we haven't); she pointed out favorites on the menu. I ordered the original Bloody Mary & Nutella Banana French Toast, and my husband ordered the. Mexicana Scrambler. We ordered and our food came out in a nice amount of time. My husband said it was the best breakfast he's ever had. We went to brunch with our 8 mo old daughter, and the staff talked with her too. We enjoyed ourselves. We will try to go back before we leave. (We're currently on vacation from Manhattan, KS)."}
{"text":"So I missed out on the Arizona Breakfast Week and had seen the reviews and really had been wanting to come here, yet I wanted to make it more of a spontaneous place to grab food after a long bike ride.  Well we shelved the training ride and came to the Hash Kitchen.  Why else would you come here but to have Hash at the Hash Kitchen.

Ordered two coffees and went from there, there's too many things on this menu that I would find extraordinarily divine.  It's really too bad I'm a man with but one stomach.  I found it hard deciding which Hash to go for but settled on the Rancheros Hash.  This isn't your normal Huevos Rancheros with some papas added in.  Oh no.  So let's break it down from the bottom to the top: Papas, Tortilla, Fried Eggs, Black Beans, Carne Asada, Chile Suace, and Cotija...if that doesn't knock you out I don't know what does.

My girlfriend ordered the Tomaso's Italian Sausange Frittata and it was perfect.  Yum.  Something was off though, I'm not sure, but it would push this over the top.  I shall investigate and re-assess.  Or maybe it was the 2.75 coffee."}
{"text":"What a shame...The worst customer service I've had a long time. My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday for brunch, we are foodies who like to try a new spot every Sunday and since this place was highly rated we were excited to try it. We have worked in the industry a long time. First thing we noticed was that their was no one to greet us at the door, no big deal since we like to sit at the bar. We took a seat at the bar top which was not busy and it took 6 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. While we waited for someone to come over we noticed the bar top was dirty with glasses everywhere and empty plates. A bartender with short brown hair pushed menus in front of us without introducing herself. We ordered quickly and i decided to try the bloody mary bar, I was very impressed great selection of options the bartender at that bar was attentive and friendly. (looking back now I wished she had been our bartender) My boyfriend tried the mimosa flight but the bartender just said ok and disappeared without allowing him to pick the four he wanted. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and said, \"Well she probably just poured the four best ones for you.\" We got our food and it looked amazing and tasted so fresh. BUT....the bartender never came back for the first bites check up. I would hope that whoever reads this would know how important that is as we both would have loved to have some hot sauce, salt & pepper. The bloody Mary was spicy and I asked for a Sprite, I had to ask four times within our 35 minute visit. Another bartender was doing dishes behind the bar and I called over to her polietly for a sprite please, she didn't hear me so I waited politely . The woman next to us at the end of the bar laughed and said she was happy that the service aspect didn't just happen to her. We asked her how long she had been there and she said she had been there for a good while but that the bartenders never checked on her after she got her first drink and food. We looked to the left and another couple had empty drinks in front of them for a good while. My boyfriend wanted to try the bloody mary bar. I had to yell to the girl, \"Excuse me, sorry can we get one more ticket for the bloody mary bar, and a sprite please?\" She said yes and ran off to tell the other bartender. The other bartender says, \"Another bloody mary?\" I said, \"Yes, he wants to try the bloody mary bar, AND a sprite please.\" She brings back a bloody mary, and drops it off without a word. However we wanted another hash bloody Mary for the different vodka options we thought were interesting, I called to her again, at this point it was a little frustrating trying to get someone but no one hearing you, \"Excuse me he wanted to do the bloody mary bar, and I need a sprite please\" She said ok there was a miscommunication. We get to go back up and try different options on the bloody Mary bar set up. At this point we just wanted to leave after we tried the different bloody Mary. We finally received the bill however we saw that the miscommunication from the bloody Mary was not handled because the bloody Mary we didn't ask for was on the bill still. She finally dropped off the Sprite as we were explaining the bloody Mary issue. She fixed the issue and re-dropped the bill; There it sat untouched in front of us for a while. The couple next to us gets up to leave and mentioned the same frustration with service.  My boyfriend and I like to tip well because we work in the industry. My boyfriend as mad as he was still tipped 20%, and turned to me and said we are never coming here again. We walked out disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome bloody Mary bar with a variety of toppings for everyone. Very generous portions & excellent service. The paella hash & cannoli pancakes were superb. Looking forward to coming back and tasting more of the menu"}
{"text":"This will be the weirdest review I've ever written. My wife is diabetic and a kidney transplant patient. She cannot eat poached eggs. 
We ordered coffee and water and looked over the menu. She decided on a pancake and asked for sugar free syrup. The waiter responded kindly that all they had was maple syrup. We were surprised that a breakfast restaurant did not have sugar free syrup and decided not to eat here. 
I tried to pay the server for our coffee but he was very kind and denied to take my payment. He also apologized for not having sugar free syrup. 
We did not eat here but gave it a 5 star rating based on their kindness and professional attitude. 
We will not be able to go back but really appreciated how we were treated."}
{"text":"The lines for brunch on a Saturday or Sunday can be very long. The good news is you can order a mimosa and sit outside until your table is ready. The food is tasty and worth the wait. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a place to come with many friends, and share 1 dish between 2-3 people. We made the mistake of ordering one dish each, and each of us barely made a dent in our food. 
We came in around 8am on a Wednesday morning. The restaurant is very clean, with gray walls, minimal ambience, with both table and booth seating. There was barely anyone in the restaurant, and the waitress seated us immediately, and asked if we'd like coffee. 
We also ordered shortly after that, and decided on the breakfast sandwich, the paella hash, and the huevos rancheros hash. All three dishes were presented at the same time, and were giant. The breakfast sandwich was large in a ridiculous sort of way, with very thick pieces of sandwich bread. My boyfriend's mother said she wished it wasn't so thick, because she could barely eat it, and wasn't very happy with the size of it. 
I thought the huevos rancheros hash was the best of all the dishes. It had a nice spice, adding kick to the otherwise plain hash, and was served with charred pieces of meat, 2 eggs cooked to our liking, black bean, and crispy tortilla. However, the meat was a little dry and chewy.
My paella hash included two pieces of jumbo shrimp, two pieces of chicken, two pieces of cut up sausage. The pieces of shrimp, chicken, and sausage were all large, but none were particularly cooked well, especially the chicken, which was tough. The potatoes were probably the best part of this dish, and even those weren't great. 
Overall, not an excellent, or even average dining experience here."}
{"text":"Delicious! Super friendly good service. Unique and delicious food. Different plates too than you may find in other places.  Prices are reasonable. Cute decor, comfortable and cozy but nice."}
{"text":"I got the herb fried chicken Benedict side of crispy bacon my fiancé got the corn beef hash it's so delicious can't wait to come back and try the Bloody Mary bar next time !!"}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service!  Gino was great with suggestions as to what to do do in PHX since we're newbies.  DJ for the breakfast crowd -nice touch!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great service even during a busy Sunday brunch time. The drinks were amazing- definitely a fan of the breakfast cocktails and the chicken and waffles were a staple done right. 

The chicken was perfectly seasoned and not the cheap tenders some places out on waffles. The Benedict was well done too, and the Bloody Mary bar looks like something we need to try next time. The options are great and this might be the best breakfast spot in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I keep on coming hoping the service will someday get better.  Today was even worse.  I came with 3 attorneys and they sat us after waiting for 10 min with no one at front desk.  They came to our table another 10 min later and took our drink order never once came back to say hello.  Or take our food order then gave us a bill.  I do not think I will be coming here ever again."}
{"text":"O.k.,  I have to start this review by letting you all know that the two wickedly beautiful older ladies who work the front of Hash Kitchen are soooooo freaking cute and hold SUCH VALUE to the Hash Kitchen brand. Owners of Hash Kitchen, give them a raise because THEY are who make it fun coming to your restaurant. I wish I grabbed their names so I could give them a shout-out here. 

Now on to the restaurant. Super, super, super fun, hip and the food selection is a re-birth of a standard \"breakfast/lunch\" restaurant. Awesome decor, the Bloody Mary bar is rockin' and the Bloody Mary I ordered was a-a-a-a-amazing! For sure try one, at least share it if you're not in the drinking mood at 10am.

I ordered the quinoa burger, yup, I decided to break free from the chains and eat something healthier, it was really really good! My handsome hubby ordered the breakfast burrito with green chili and he tore that 'ish apart.

The only thing I can recommend is that you space the tables just a couple inches further apart. Saw a lot of hip hitting the corners of the table casualties. Other than that, try it out, enjoy a drink and for sure a great place to go with friends, super hip."}
{"text":"Gino provided great service with recommendations with the fried chicken and waffles. The chicken and waffles came with shoestring onions. We would come back again.
C&W"}
{"text":"Awesome food , great service , I will come back most definitely . Try the breakfast burger , was to die for ."}
{"text":"Inventive brunch fare with something for everyone. Visiting from out of town, I dined solo at the bar. The staff was very accommodating - Betty and team took very good care of me. Recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and high energy!
Austin behind the bar was great and Bonnie made sure everyone was taken care of. 

We had the mimosa flight, a bloody mary, make your own scramble and the carnitas hash - all which were delicious! 

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST breakfast/brunch place. The customer service is by far the best I had, and it only continues to get better with each visit."}
{"text":"I enjoy Hash Sunday Brunch but my husband didn't like the music was so loud. Service was excellent and the food fresh .   We went on a day during the week we both were happy .  That Bloody Mary was a meal by itself!"}
{"text":"After waiting 30-45 minutes to be seated, the wait for drinks was even longer. We ordered the mimosa flights which seemed to take forever and then were told they were out glasses because another party of 10 had taken them (huh?) It was only 3 to our party. When our drinks finally arrived, the guy told us \"sorry you guys don't get them on a board, we're out\". The food was mediocre to say the least. I will not be returning to this place. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"What the what!!! Ok! So I pride myself in good food and good drink! Let's just start by saying this is my new favorite brunch spot... In Arizona!!! Let's start with the BYOB Bloody Mary bar. A choice of like 5 infused vodkas. I, of course, choice the bacon vodka. They have garnishes from bacon to oysters to capresse skewers to beets to Gouda. All to say.... Amazing! Then there is the food that is not found in my beverage...I got the brisket hash that was made by the bbq place next store, which hash also owns. Green chilies, brisket, cornbread potato hash with poached eggs. Yum!!! The manager, Linda, who is now on my top 10 favorite people ever, brought over some homemade bbq sauce to eat use on my hash... Some of the best bbq sauce I have ever had and this means something from someone who basically bleeds bbq! My hash came with a fresh biscuit that I ended up eating even though I was so full! My mom got the corned beef hash which was everything God intended it to be! The food at Hash Kitchen goes above and beyond your exceptional brunch. Not only is the food here amazing and every bite delusions, but the people here take it that extra step! We greeted by 2 lovely woman that were genuinely excited we were there! The manager sat us and brought us water and also introduced us to the restaurant and the menu. She was warm and knowledgeable. Linda. Linda is the manager as well as the giver of sauce! She is the one who hooked me up with the bbq sauce. The bartender who helped me with the Bloody Mary bar was incredible! We gave me samples and walked me through every step of creating my personal Bloody Mary. Our waitress was adorable and very helpful. Love this place so much that I will be back here on Friday and probably Sunday too... Thank you Hash Kitchen, not for the bigger pants size that I will now have to attain, but for reminding me what Sunday brunch should be."}
{"text":"Loved the food! This is my second time coming and I had to bring my family and show them what its all about! Gino is the bomb"}
{"text":"So impressed with this restaurant today! Our party of ten came in, was seated right away, and the food was great! Bloody Mary's were excellent and the bar to make them was fun. Favorite dishes were crab hash, breakfast burrito, and the chicken bene and chicken hash."}
{"text":"My sister and I spent a few days celebrating my bday and a friend recommended Hash Kitchen. We had a blast!!!! The DJ was amazing and kept us dancing the whole time. Bonnie...LOVE HER!!! The food is all that and the staff too...will def go back!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and great staff. One of the best Bloody Mary bar's I've seen and very good breakfast. Would definitely recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"I'd go between a 4-5... Making it a 4.5!

The Bloody Mary bar is amazing and is a must do if you like Bloody Mary's. You can top it with all sorts of goodies and they have their own infused vodkas to give your drink that extra kick! Jalapeño lime was my choice and it was amazing and spicy. 

Once you're done there, enjoy them while you get your food. The chicken and waffles are delicious. The waffle is perfect. Crispy and fluffy and flavorful. Be aware that they are topped with a lot of fried leeks (which I loved) but my BF could've gone with a little less. Which is totally ok cause then I got to eat what he didn't want. I ended up adding the leeks to my Mexican scramble because my scramble was just alright. Just imagine eggs with a mix of whatever you decided to order. I felt like it needed a little something more but next time, I'd do the crab scramble or the benedicts instead. The potatoes have great flavor and I'm torn between the flavor and then not being traditional fried breakfast potatoes. The biscuit was good but almost needed some extra butter or something. Not as moist and flaky as that perfect biscuit. 

Overall, we loved it there and would definitely go back. We plan to go back in March during spring training!"}
{"text":"Best place to go for brunch with your girlfriends. Bloody Mary bar is top notch and atmosphere makes it fun. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Huge portions, great food. Need I say more?
French press coffee is really good here, and so are the carrot cake pancakes."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Great food, service and atmosphere.  My husband and I both had crab dishes, he had the Crab Hash, I had the Crab Benedict both delicious and loaded with lump blue crab!  We are usually disappointed when we order a crab dish but not this time!  Loved it and will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious and beautiful. Had the fried chicken Benny and those fried leeks were just heaven on top. Hot sauce on the side and was fire. Would have preferred Tabasco or Tapatio.

The wait was a little long but what can you really expect on a Sunday, am I right?grapefruit mimosas...nuff said.

One negative: music was slightly too loud. Was a dj really worth it? I personally think not."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my delicious breakfast here with my son. Great atmosphere and the owner was very friendly. Definitely will return to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Happening place for breakfast...check it out if you're in the area. Busy on the weekends... come early, otherwise expect about 45min wait. Service is slow as well and not too friendly. Hashes are ok...we had the carnitas one. Chicken and waffles not good, chicken was way over cooked and super dry. Waffle was dry and bacon was sparse. Quite loud, so don't expect a quaint quiet breakfast where you can hold a conversation. Was ok... don't think we'll be returning."}
{"text":"In Scottsdale from out of town. We had brunch on Sunday - 5 adults and one child.  Nice ambiance and the Bloody Mary bar was FUN and you can build quite a drink for $10.  We got some laughs out of comparing our creations - mine had smoked salmon-infused vodka, bacon salt rim, topped with a raw oyster on the half shell, lots of different olives, bacon, pickled carrots, a pickled egg, and fried oysters.  Very yum!  We had an order of cannoli stop share - creamy and cinnamon-spiced; more like donuts, but delicious.  The food was just adequate for the price - I had the recommended crab and sweet potato hash ($24) and it was good, topped with 2 poached eggs, but not awesome as some reported.  It was served dry (odd) and I had to ask for hollandaise to pour over.  The biscuit with good quality soft butter and some delicious berry jam.  My vegetarian son-in-law had a lot to choose from; I think he had a frittata.  Everyone enjoyed their meals, but didn't think the food was better than other places.  My grandson had breakfast Popsicles and he loved those - how unique is that?  The service was great and they took our reservation, which we appreciated.  I don't think we would go back, with so many choices, though the drink bar was phenom."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite brunch spot in Scottsdale! Every time I visit from Cali I make it a point to come here. Mimosa flights, carnitas hash, live DJ...what's not to love!? Owners are super sweet and fun too!"}
{"text":"Just had the Chorizo Frittata and it was \"just ok\" lacked flavor. I was expecting way more from this place and it did not deliver. Coffee was very good (lavazza). Service was ok but noting inviting. The server just delivered the check and did not ask if I wanted anything else. They have donuts! Oh boy! Think outside the box! Lol 

Basically I wouldn't come back to this place and I don't recommend, unless you like tasteless food and donuts! Lol don't waste your time, plenty more to choose from. I like the concept but they fail at implementing it. High priced Denny's. You got one star for coffee..."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious. Omg will be coming back. I got the lump crab Benedict and it was so gooooddd!!! The berry waffle was crispy and just the way I like it. The only reason for not the full 5 stars was that the breakfast lasagna came out cold. But over all great service and delicious food recommend getting the flight mimosa."}
{"text":"Good location and they have done a nice job renovating it into a upscale brunch spot. 
Blood Mary bar was obviously the focal point of the restaurant. For the price, there were plenty of options to dress up your beverage. Well done. 
Staff was friendly and pleasant and we had good service. 
The food was ok. The lump crab hash was mushy and bland. Great presentation in cast iron skillet but poached eggs over cooked. The lump crab eggs Benedict suffered from the same over cooked poached eggs and dry biscuit."}
{"text":"-My mimosa was well made.
-I had the Salmon Hash. It had a substantial portion of salmon but needed a few more capers, in my opinion.
-My fiancé enjoyed one of the specials: Sweet corn waffle with shredded pork, which was awesome and plentiful.
-Our server, Christopher, went the extra mile to actually make honey butter for my biscuit!
-Pleasant, relaxing atmosphere."}

{"text":"A snapshot of a summer Sunday at Hash Kitchen: Bloody Mary's and mimosas EVERYWHERE, a REAL LIVE DJ bumpin' Despacito, and herds of well-tanned suburban families waiting for their chance to be called for a table...

Hash Kitchen was confusing, yet wonderful. It's clear that this place has the brunch game down PAT.

(+) REASONABLY-PRICED, AESTHETICALLY-PLEASING DRINKS
At $16, the Mimosa Flight is pretty freaking worth it considering you get 4 full-sized mimosas to try. My friends were fans of the grapefruit mimosa!

(++) THE CARNITAS HASH
HUUUUGE TASTY portion that I could not manage to finish despite my greatest efforts! The way the hash mixed with the carnitas and sweet corn, topped with an egg and some avocado....SO. UNREAL. I would come back for this dish alone. 

Why not 5 stars? I wasn't crazy about the Lump Crab & Sweet Potato Hash - the portion was smaller than the other hashes and not NEARLY as flavorful as the Carnitas. The service was very attentive, but a bit slow. The time from arriving to actually paying the bill for my group of 6 girls was about 2.5-3 hours....so don't come on a time crunch!

Overall, I would TOTALLY come back, I could seriously eat that Carnitas Hash everyday!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Bloody Mary bar!!!  This place is great!  There's usually a bit of a wait, especially on weekends, but you can get your drink and wait outside, which is nice.  Very lively and upbeat, there's a DJ there on weekends and great vibes.  The food is excellent, and even mimosa flights...and did I mention the Bloody Marys?  We have only been to the one in North Scottsdale, but the service has always been wonderful, and the older lady who manages it is always dancing around and keeps things lively.  
This isn't a sleepy little brunch spot to have quiet conversations at, so expect it to be lively and expect a wait on the weekends, but it's definitely worth it!!!"}
{"text":"True let down. I was excited to brunch at Hash with my friends on a Sunday and it was the worst decision possible.  The service and the food was subpar.  The only good thing about our brunch was the music. There is a Bloody Mary bar located directly across the entrance which may be the worst location. It truly congests the area making minimal room space around when its busy.

The counter where you put your name in was unorganized and they said they didn't take reservations... but it seemed like some people were allowed 'reservations'... To not help the situation, we waited much longer than they had anticipated for us - almost double.

I ordered the breakfast sandwich with fries and the one thing I was looking forward to (since we were waiting for close to 2 hrs) came out COLD! This sandwich has a lot going on, maybe too much for a breakfast meal. Made with bacon & onion jam, piled high smoked ham, avocado, 2 fried eggs, pepper jack cheese on brioche texas toast.

I really tried to enjoy but I just couldn't."}
{"text":"This place is a well run operation my fave dish is the sweet potato hash , lump crab with poached eggs the decor is elegant and inviting service is top notch"}
{"text":"It's a family favorite! The portions are pretty decent (aka large enough to share) and the flavor matches the atmosphere - lively, open space, options for everyone and great music. We can't wait for the other locations to open! Closer to us means we will go more often! Although this is def a family friendly place, I'd go for brunch for some day drinking."}
{"text":"A live DJ + Mimosas + A killer Bloody Mary bar = ahhhmazing. This trendy brunch spot is poppin and has the best energy!!! 

I visited the Frank Lloyd Wright location because I heard it is not as busy as the more central Scottsdale location. I was seated right away on a busy Saturday morning, and our waiter brought over my Bloody Mary ticket and my boyfriend's flight of mimosas (you get four flavors! He had original, blueberry, pineapple, and guava. Guava was my fav!) really quickly. I went over to the the Bloody Mary bar and you choose your rim seasoning, vodka flavor (bacon vodka, anyone?), the type of mix you want, and then you load on all the toppings! There's over 40 to choose from and I think I took full advantage. 

For food, I ordered the cannoli pancakes. I'm a sucker for cannoli's and these were GREAT! It's a massive stack so I was glad to have extra to take home and enjoy later. My boyfriend had a hash scramble, my mom had the bruschetta board (the fig/brie/bacon was out of this world), and my grandma tried the crab roll. We loved all of it!! Hash kitchen pulls off the sweet and savory perfectly. 

Honestly I think the best part about this place is the atmosphere. It's super trendy, the DJ is sooo fun, and the service was great. If you're looking for a new, go-to brunch spot, this is the place!!"}
{"text":"Adriaan at the Bloody Mary bar made my experience at the Hash kitchen out of this world.  His hospitality was out of this world. He truly understands what it takes to create an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"We have come here a handful of times.  The atmosphere was completely different from one visit to another.  The first time we came it was lively and there was a DJ and it was packed.  The owner (I think?) was out laughing and dancing around...it was a hoot.  The second time it was very quiet and seemed like a completely different place.  They may have been having an event or something the first time...not sure.  Either way, it is fine...I like to be able to hear my husband talk so I was okay with it. The bacon is AMAZING.  I can't explain it, but its the best bacon I have ever had in my life.  I could eat an entire tray of it. lol.  The rest of the food is okay, nothing spectacular.  Its pretty pricey, but you know and expect that going in just from the atmosphere, it is a pretty \"hipster\" joint.  My office is getting ready to move down the street from them, and I look forward to coming in for that bacon more often. YUM!"}
{"text":"Started with a Bloody Mary.  The most mild Bloody Mary was pretty spicy. My wife had a mimosa and that was pretty good.  My wife had the americano and was very tasty.  I had the breakfast burrito and it was excellent.  The service was a bit slow but not bad enough to not come back"}
{"text":"We had a late lunch with Gino as our server.  He was super friendly and seemed to enjoy his job.  I had a salad, hubbie had a hash and our daughter ordered a cheese burger.  All were great!  The interior was fun and vibe upbeat.  Even though we didn't order a Bloody Mary, the bar looked good.  We would recommend and return."}
{"text":"Great place! Loved the DJ concept. Lots of fun! We love bloody Mary's and I have never been to Bloody Mary bar like this before. It has everything. It was a meal on its own. $12 I believe we paid. I was actually full before our breakfast came. Its a hoppin place to go for breakfast. I highly recommend it! One thing negative... they were super busy and we waited awhile before we were acknowledge and we sat at the bar. They may need a little more staff to accommodate the crowd."}
{"text":"Second time there,  we had great Bloody Mary's.  Sat at the bar because the wait time for a table was really long.  The sound level is pretty high but that didn't deter us."}
{"text":"Hash House is definitely an awesome brunch pick! Perhaps not for larger parties though because they seem to have trouble accommodating. We had a group of 14 people with a reservation that was made in advance. The hostess sat us at a table and about 10 minutes after being sat, an EXTREMELY rude female, red headed manager came over throwing a fit claiming that it was not our table. Like why yell at the guests? You sat us here? Apparently there was a group of 12 that also had a reservation and we were at the table designated for them. The manager was prepared to have us move all of our things over to a different table which seemed like an unnecessary hassle. Another female manager (I'm assuming is the superior) suggested that the other group just be placed at the other table... problem solved!!! The original woman was so unprofessional and made us feel guilty for a mistake that was on their part! Without this incident I would give this place 5 stars for sure!
The cereal cocktails are very fun and crafty and my breakfast sandwich was amazing!!! I wish I remembered the name of our server because she was out of this world polite and accommodating. She seemed like she genuinely loved her job and everyone had good things to say about her!"}
{"text":"I have been to HASH KITCHEN 3 times and am never disappointed!  This time I brought 6 friends from out of town and they could not believe the incredible, delicious food and the fabulous service.  They are world travelers and thought HASH KITCHEN rated amongst the best breakfast they had experienced!  High praise from them!  I couldn't agree more!  The owner BONNIE is gracious and helpful.  Our server EVAN could not have been better.  He had a great sense of humor and everything came out exactly as it was ordered!  

Great place!  Great Food!"}
{"text":"Here's the hash. First time. Ambience great. Bloody Mary bar was nice. The service pretty good. The food. Very disappointed. The chick waffles. Terrible chicken. Breast was leftover refried tough inedible. Wait girl was very nice about it. But first impression. Not again."}
{"text":"5-star presentation, but this place is lacking on flavor and atmosphere. I have been here 3 times, twice for the chicken and waffles (which really are amazing!) and most recently for the chicken verde. The latter was a bit of a disappointment- soggy chips and way too much verde sauce...I should've known to stick with what I knew. My boyfriend has gotten a few of the hash entrees and none were anything to write home about. Atmosphere is...confusing. Don't get me wrong I am all for trendy and upbeat, but IMO it's kinda weird to have a DJ blasting in the middle of breakfast. In south Scottsdale/old town they get away with it being that it's a BAR scene, but that's not at all the vibe up here. Service was okay, they were swamped every time I went so slow service was expected- just don't expect to be in/out!"}
{"text":"Seriously cutest place you can get brunch any day of the week. The build your own Bloody Mary bar is fantastic and can suit the needs of anyone. If you don't like Bloody Mary's then their mimosa flights are perfect for finding your specific flavor. Lona is one of the sweetest and funniest servers here that helps you figure out what you want to eat. (Ask to sit in her section!) this is always my go to spot for brunch!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Hash Kitchen for SO long, so as soon as we had a free weekend morning to go, we tried it out! The restaurant itself is in a nice location and very pretty. I love the sayings they have written on the wall and the patio is awesome! We got a great table (and were seated right away on a Sunday morning, even though they were pretty busy!) that was right on the edge of the patio, so we still got the sun but it was a little bit cooler. 

A huge part of why I wanted to come to Hash Kitchen was for the mimosa flights, but the reason I'll go back is for the waffles :) I just got the classic waffle, but it was amazing! Perfectly filling and sweet and buttery and delicious. The best I've had in a long time for sure. The mimosa flight was tasty too, and you get very good-sized glasses. Today the flight was original, guava, strawberry and mango - normally I don't even like mango that much, but it was definitely my favorite! I'd highly recommend it. 

My boyfriend did a make-your-own scramble and had it with cheese, zucchini and black beans and he really enjoyed it as well. It comes with a great biscuit too. We also each had the HK potatoes on the side, which were nothing special, but good! You also get a lot of them considering they're a reasonably priced side. He also got a Bloody Mary (just the classic) and said it was the best he'd had in a while! 

I think next time we come we'll skip the drinks because it makes for an expensive breakfast, but I can't wait to go back for the waffle :)"}
{"text":"First off, i do want to say this review is based only off of 1 individual who was very rude! The food, atmosphere, service from my server and people in front, whom i am assuming were the owners were super delightful! My girlfriend and i wanted to try this place out before we catched our flight. Everything was great until we wanted to make our own bloody mary at the bar. As i approached the bar and saw Melissa, i already felt a very brushed off feeling from her. I started to ask her for step 1 on which rub was on the classic bloody mary because that was the one we had earlier so at least i know which one i have tried already. Her response was very attitudy. It was like u should already know what u already want before coming up here. Ok fine, i sucked it up then asked her which one was the regular olives because there were so many fancy names on them. Her response was, idk bc i cannot see the name tags. Are you freaking kidding me girl? Who the heck do you think you are? Even if you dont know, find out and educate your customer! Know what youre selling, put a dam smile on your face, and act like you like your job! As i brought back my unsatisfied drink back to my table, i started to vent with my gf about the experience i just had. So conveniently the table next to me overheard my conversation and just went thru the same ordeal w melissa. Sigh....owners u may have a problem there......"}
{"text":"Love the the selections of the Craft Mimosas! Cant decide which one was my favorite! Mango, Kiwi, Raspberry, or Classic! Perfect atmospher to celebrate my future sister -in-law!"}
{"text":"For a party of 31 people inclusive of children, I think Hash kitchen handled our brunch on Sunday morning really well. We arrived there at around 10:30am. Half of us were already there and the other half started coming in about 10 minutes later. It was such a busy day at Hash kitchen but despite that, our day there was great. There is a DJ on Sunday and apparently on Saturday too. I liked the music very much. It made the whole atmosphere seem fun and full of energy. 

We all were given the menus when we arrived and there was ice water in mason jars on the table already. Soon after we arrived, we were asked if we would like to have something to drink. Most of us were ok with water, some ordered orange juice, and some coffee. 

We all placed our orders at around the same time except for one of the families who arrived very early with kids and decided to order ahead of everyone. 

I looked at the menu and was particularly interested in trying the fried chicken salad sandwich. About 3 other people in our party also ordered the same sandwich. My husband ordered the veggie scramble. I also ordered a cup of coffee. About 15 minutes after we ordered, the food started to come out and I got my coffee. Everything that arrived on the table looked fresh and inviting. I kept waiting for my food, and after everyone was served, I was the only one still waiting. After about 25 minutes now, I asked about my order and the waiter rushed to the kitchen to check. Unfortunately, a small error happened where my sandwich was delivered to a nearby table that ordered the same one at around the same time. Our waiter was very apologetic and promised the food will come out as soon as possible. Surely enough, about 10-15 minutes later, my sandwich came out. It was fresh and looked great. I had my first bite and thought, well, it was worth the wait. Not only did I receive a very big apology from another waiter as well, but the meal was removed off our bill and I was served a donut, on the house! Thank you! I really appreciate what they have done to compensate for my wait. 

Soon after I finished eating, we paid and left. The prices overall were reasonable. As we were leaving I noticed how many people were in the restaurant and how many were in line waiting for tables inside and out. I liked that they had ice cold lemonade for free so all the people who were waiting can enjoy it while they wait. It's amazing how popular this place is and now that I have tried it, I know why! 

Definitely worth trying. Definitely worth going back to! Well done Hash Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Nice spot for breakfast. Food was good, service was decent and the patio is awesome. Nothing over the top special as far as culinary excellence just solid breakfast food. This place is good big to be packed once people find out about it...they take reservations but only for parties 10 or more so grab your friends. Worth while place for morning grub and lunch."}
{"text":"Adrian at the Bloody Mary bar is awesome!  Great variety of toppings.  Good food.  Great atmosphere.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Do not go if you are are looking for someplace quiet, though!  Went for Sunday brunch with party of 7. Unfortunately they only take reservations for 10+ so we had an hour wait. But they have a dj spinning great tunes, a number of different mimosas AND a Bloody Mary Bar to die for. You pick the rim, the vodka (can you say bacon vodka!?) and the mix and there's a bar that resembles a salad bar about 5' long with every fixin you can imagine - including fried ravioli and jalapeño poppers!  When we finally got our table service was good and the food was amazing. We had the brunch bruschetta for the table (my personal favorite was the fog jam, Brie and bacon). For meal I had the prosciutto Benedict and my friend got the Cristina's tamale cakes and we shared - both were so good. This place is a super fun experience and a fantastic concept!"}
{"text":"A week or so ago we found this restaurant on yelp and went for the Bloody Mary's, we had a lot of fun building our own bloody but unfortunately they didn't taste as good as they looked. We asked for spicy and the server went a little overboard they were almost impossible to drink!

As for the food my boyfriend got the chilaquiles and they were delicious! They were a little too big so we took the rest home and they were the perfect afternoon snack!  The service we received seemed like he was trying to be funny but it came across a little rude. That might just be our personalities that clashed but it didn't make for the best experience."}
{"text":"Our group of 10 was looking forward to  brunch at Hash Kitchen after it had been recommended by friends. We were in Scottsdale celebrating and had flown in from all over the country and wanted to catch up over brunch. 

When we arrived for our 10:30 reservation, the hostess told us rudely and flippantly that there was no reservation. After much back and forth, they continued to say the mistake was on my end. I had been planning this trip for weeks and since brunch was going to be a big event during the weekend, I am absolutely certain that I had made a reservation for 10 at that location. 

The staff was extremely rude, unhelpful and dismissive. They did absolutely nothing to try to remedy the situation- they didn't even offer to put our name on the wait list. The reservation \"system\" was a paper list and since I had called weeks in advance, it must have been an error on their end. Our group ended up stranded in a strip mall with no where to take our large party for a fun meal together.

Update: The owner did reach out to try to determine what went wrong and make the situation better. Unfortunately, there isn't much to be done after the fact but the follow up is much appreciated!"}
{"text":"Very nice and trendy breakfast spot.  They have a pretty good bloody mary bar.  My advice is to order the non spicy option.  I had the spicy one and it was hell fire.  The pancake sampler wasn't bad.  The pancakes could use a little more sauce on them, but we still enjoyed them.  I also had the carnitas skillet.  I enjoyed it, but a little more carnitas wouldn't have hurt.  Overall, a nice breakfast, and even though the location is in a strip mall, once you're in the restaurant the feel is a nice and airy one."}
{"text":"By far, my favorite breakfast place in town!  I keep getting the \"Boring Benny\" because it is so good but I've also tried a few other things that have not disappointed.  They are also family friendly with providing coloring books for the kids and a cover for the high chairs."}
{"text":"All I know is that the feisty , adorable older woman whom I believe is one of the owners and a fabulous hostess is just AWESOME! I would come back just to hang out with her if for no other reason. Their bloody Mary bar is out of this world and the best $10 I have ever spent. I mean it is a meal in itself, and the fact that they let you go back to top off your toppings is awesome. If you like spicy, definitely get the jalapeno infused vodka with the hot sauce. OMG delicious! My actual meal was not all the great to me. I ordered the lump crab and sweet potato hash and unfortunately it had no flavor. The hash could definitely been cooked a little longer because parts of the sweet potato chunks were still raw. The lump meat was bland and the portion was ok for the $14 I spent on the meal. I just wish it had more flavor. The biscuit however was pretty tasty. Not sure why my meal was so lackluster, but because of the the service, the company I was with, the bloody Mary bar, and that fabulous hostess will definitely earn a repeat trip."}
{"text":"LOVED this place. The service was wonderful. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming! It's great to have a brunch place where you can have a cocktail too. We had the cannoli doughnuts, rumchata iced coffee, and croque madame sandwich. So yummy! We will be back."}
{"text":"I ate breakfast here with a friend. We both tried a different hash - thinking that a namesake item would be the best way to go. I even went with what our bartender said was his favorite. Neither of us were that impressed. I had the carnitas (usually a go to if I see it on a menu!) and my friend had the Italian. Meh. Plus his biscuit had a hair baked into it. They did replace his biscuit. Hair happens. The bloody mary bar looks pretty amazing - although I wasn't drinking that day. I may have to stop in and try something different with the blood mary."}
{"text":"It was ok. Friday st 8:30 with no wait. Service not the most attentive but nice. Although she asked if we needed anything else and was gone before we answered yes."}
{"text":"I'm giving Hash a low star review because they didn't honor their advertised summer special of the $5 Bloody Mary bar (M-F) on the 4th of July.

In a town where $5 mimosas and Bloody Mary's are on every corner, it's ridiculous that they wouldn't honor a summer special, no matter what holiday it was. I should also mention that nowhere on their website where they advertise these specials did they say certain days were excluded. They are literally saying to us that on the day it is actually convenient for working people to stop in for a week day brunch, is the day they are going to take advantage of is. Just another restaurant being greedy and taking advantage of us star-spangled brunch-aholics.

The service at the bar was super friendly, but slow (had to call her over on more than one occasion). The food here is generally tasty and the menu has a good selection, but the eggs are almost always watery. Not to mention the dishwasher was practically exploding behind the bar, gushing water everywhere and leaving puddles on the floor -- probably not the most ideal of environments for the bartenders, but maybe it didn't bother them."}
{"text":"My husband was crazy happy when I told him about the opening of the Hash Kitchen. Hash is his favorite breakfast dish by far and he's eaten it from coast to coast. Plus, this one is near our home and the reviews said that they are dog friendly so there are a lot of reasons for us to frequent it. 

Admittedly, we got there in the last hour before they were closing. The hostess was terrific and friendly and we opted to sit at the bar. The menu has a lot of great options. My husband ordered a beer which apparently they didn't have on tap. They told him that he could go over next door and get one (they must also own that space) but since we were seated, he didn't really want to walk to the other bar to retrieve his beer. 

The food was okay. It was good but there were cleaning up around us like crazy. My water glass never got refilled. I get it - they wanted to go home but if they want it that bad, they should change their hours. 

They do have a nice space and a good looking bloody mary bar. We may give it another try some time in the future."}
{"text":"Sad to admit we did this--but we actually first went to another high ranking b-fast restaurant in the PHX area. Even sat down. And then one look around, at the decor, the menu, the \"bakery case\", and we knew we had to plan our escape. Blamed the kid, said something about family issue, and ran.
So so happy we tried Hash next.  Whet to begin. Clean. Bright. Modern. Apple Store + brunch spot = their style.  I've seen a Bloody Mary bar before...  But one with fresh raw oysters, pickled mango or bacon infused vodka??  Stop what you are doing--come here now. BTW, came on a Monday morning, but the whole deal was on display just like a weekend.
I also ordered corned beef hash and biscuits & gravy.  Hash was excellent, gravy was one of the best, and biscuit was fresh if not just a touch too sweetened for biscuits/gravy delivery system. Probably perfect w butter & honey.

No more reading. You. Here. Now."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for the first time about 2 weeks ago. It is a beautiful place. Very Scottsdale. The food was just ok. We had the the hash, eggs bennie, biscuits and gravy and bacon. The bacon was amazing! The brisket hash was good, not great (needed seasoning badly), my wife said the eggs bennie was not that good. She said the hollandaise sauce lacked flavor and seasoning and was quite bland. I would say that this is an issue other yelpers have noticed but it doesn't seem that the chef is reading these reviews. I did speak with the server about the issue directly so hopefully it will finally get address. This place could be amazing, but right now they are just 3/5. Service was 5/5. We had no wait and the place was essentially empty on a wed. morning."}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend on Sunday! First thing to notice was it was extremely busy! But we sat at the bar and still managed to get wonderful service! The food was creative, delicious and quickly brought out to us! They have a good menu with so many different dishes to try! A place I will come again to --- an again, and again!"}
{"text":"Tried this place while on a staycation in Scottsdale. Food was delicious! I had the chorizo and mushroom hash with a biscuit on the side. Eggs on top were cooked perfectly. French press coffee was sooooo good and a definite must try. Staff was great and super attentive and nice. The bloody mary bar looked great and such a cool concept when you want to build your own bloody mary. Overall great place for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Bloody Mary bar is incredible, with so many options and two hot appetizers included. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! This was my first time at hash kitchen, I looked online and found this place and it was amazing! Jesus was our server and he recommended so many great things and was very helpful! I will be coming back and recommending all my friends !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here to meet a friend in town from CA for spring training. Our waiter Chris was awesome. He knew them from when they came for lunch the day before. ANYWAY...let's start with the bloody Mary bar...I'm a sucker for a good bloody Mary..this place does not disappoint! I went through myself the first time and tried the jalapeño vodka and added celery salt and a pickle and piece of bacon etc and loved my drink. While I was enjoying my drink and knew I may run out, breakfast was served.  I went back to the bloody Mary bar and while I was in line our waiter  came up to me and said \"go back to your table, I will make your drink so you can eat without your food getting cold and bring it to your table.\" He then asked for my drink choices and garnishments and I have to say, he nailed it and I had two of the best Bloody Mary's of my life here. So, on the food front...I later went to urgent care the same day and was told I had a sinus infection, so the fact that I felt like the food I ate was some of best ever on like like 33% of my taste buds is saying something. I'm a sucker for short ribs, so I ordered the Benedict with the short ribs and I have to say it was one of the best things I have ever eaten. My companions were confused as to whether I was disgusted or in delight...I can assure you I was in delight. Seriously yummy! I only wish they were on my side of town, but according  to our waiter they have a Chandler location opening soon! I hope so!"}
{"text":"My second time to this location! Can I just say how much I love the hostess. I don't know her name but her alone makes this place vibe very well. This time I had the Huevos Ranheros Hash and it was delish. I do like the pork carnitas more. The. Blueberry mimosa was also refreshing. Love this place"}
{"text":"This place was ok, I've been to many brunch places and it wouldn't be on my top 5 but I will come back to try other things in the menu. I ordered the lump crab hash and I felt like there wasn't much crab in it. The sweet potato was also soggy. I then ordered the French toast which was really good. The fresh fruit made it not soooo heavy. I saw a few things in there that I would like to try next time. Staff was great."}
{"text":"Get the mimosa flight!!!! Great portions and fun to try all the flavors! Food was awesome, Gino gave us great service!"}
{"text":"Loud and crowded, but awesome food. I had the lemon ricotta pancakes and I'm in love. There were four pancakes and there's no way to possibly eat it all. I tried, they were so good. We're also in love with the mimosa flight. We ordered after seeing someone else's go by. 

Also great service in case you wondered."}
{"text":"BEST brunch in AZ! Great customer service! The staff is super friendly, informative, and continue to check and make sure you have everything to your liking! The lady up front is the sweetest and cutest!
The Amazing Bloody Mary bar is to die for with anything and everything you can think of including oyster! I had the lump crab sweet potato hash which was SO freakin delicious! Thinking about it right now is making my mouth water!!! My husband had pork Benedict and I ate half of that too! Yum! Kids had biscuits and gravy, pancakes, eggs and bacon. They LOVED it and it's all great portions!! This is definitely my favorite place for brunch! I can't wait till next weekend to come back!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first stop after landing in Phoenix early in the morning on a Wednesday. I found this place on Yelp and was impressed with the great reviews! 

I got here around 11 in the morning and it wasn't too busy at all. I decided to sit at the bar and was greeted by the friendly bartender. I saw the Crab Eggs Benedict on one of the Yelp photos but they no longer had that item on the menu. I chose to go with the Blackened Shrimp Eggs Benedict. 

I really don't eat eggs benedict too much but I thought the hollandaise was pretty good! The blackened shrimp was good and the asparagus went well with the dish. The only change I would make would be to ask for the potatoes to be crispy. I don't like soggy potatoes. 

The restaurant looks pretty trendy and seems like a good brunch spot. I would definitely come back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"I went to The Hash Kitchen and got the AZ Breakfast Week for $15. I got the Ranchero Hash with a peach mimosa, and a cannoli donut for dessert. I loved the atmosphere! I will for sure come back for brunch. There was even a DJ!"}
{"text":"Delish! I love the atmosphere. What a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon! I had the Lump Crab Benedict and it was amazing! One of those dishes I'll crave! Others I was with had Smoked Salmon Benedict and the Black Forrest Ham Scramble and both were delicious! Ask for Chris. He was the best!"}
{"text":"GREAT ATMOSPHERE AND GOOD VIBES! Not to mention they have the best BYOBM (build your own Bloody Mary) Bar and craft mimosas, along with a very creative brunch menu (see below for recommendations as well as ingredients).

{"text":"Going up on a Sunday  The atmosphere of this place is like party party party  loud music, dancing granny, and 20-to-30-somethings gettin their breakfast on. The wait was long (45 minutes on Sunday at noon) but the food was worth it. Got the Carnitas Hash with tender juicy carnitas (albeit not crispy), 2 over easy eggs, Chile verde, avocado, and piled high with fried onions - put it all together and you have the perfect bite...that I literally couldn't stop eating even though I was BEYOND full bc it was so  damn  good"}
{"text":"Maybe everyone that wrote a five star review had a great experience, or maybe they just buy into the pretentious Scottsdale BS that this place has down to a science. I get that they took a high-end restaurant and turned it into a brunch spot but honestly the decor prices DJ the whole scene was totally over-the-top and they seem much more concerned about appearances then actual quality of service and food.

What's right:
- Great Diverse Menu 
- Great Drinks
- Awesome Bloody Mary Bar
- Clean

What's wrong:
- Overpriced- we each had one drink and an entree and the bill was $90 for 4 people. For BREAKFAST
- Awful staff - the manager is a total ass. I saw him yell at staff in a completely derogatory and condescending manner multiple times. He did literally nothing except try to look important when clearly his staff needs coaching on service. And the hostess had on booty jorts and a 2.99 tank top from forever 21. Not knocking that outfit in general but it seems kind of tacky considering the image they're trying to portray. Plus the gross manager was all brushing up on her.
- No specials - not everyplace has to have unlimited mimosas but some sort of deal would be nice, like 2 for ten or something 
- THE FREAKIN HASH! - i'm going to go out on a limb here but if you're going to put the word hash into the name of your business your hash should probably be pretty decent right? I ordered a hash with fresh lump crab on it and was pretty excited to try it. Unfortunately the sweet potatoes in the hash were completely undercooked and disgusting. So I sent back the hash and it came back out with cooked yet flavorless potatoes but now there is no egg on it. So by the time I got my food everyone was done eating and finally I got my complete meal about 40 minutes after I ordered. My sister ordered another hash with regular potatoes and was equally unimpressed. You just need to do something special if you're going to base your menu around something.

And the cardinal sin of all breakfast places as well as number one indicator a breakfast place will go out of business..... Drumroll please... They did not keep our coffee cups full. Each of us had coffee and it was only refilled one time and that was after sitting empty for at least 10 minutes. The server brought the check and never asked if we wanted more but we did so we asked for more which turned out to be a good idea because we waited about another 15 minutes for our credit card to be run. 

I give points for the menus creativity but the execution is bad and the service worse. I give this place 2 stars and 6 months!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast, had the fried chicken & waffles"}
{"text":"Food was meh, Bloody Mary bar was an awesome concept but the mix wasn't all that great. I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"While in Scottsdale with my boyfriend we wanted a very nice brunch spot before our couples massage. I found this little gem on yelp and did not regret it one bit. The service reminds me of gals from the south - very friendly and actually look happy to be there regardless if they are or not. I went with the smores French toast and it was seriously heaven! Like if I died and went to heaven I would imagine this was at the breakfast buffet (because heaven rewards you with breakfast buffets and in heaven you don't gain weight). We also got a side of fruit and it came out on a platter and displayed nicely, very impressed. My man got the eggs Benedict and he of course gobbled it all up. Definitely swing by if you can, no regrats  (spelling intentially wrong)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is excellent and a huge variety; even the coffee is amazing.

If you come, ask for Gino and get his recommendation on what to have, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I haven't felt the need to review a restaurant until now. This place is amazing! If the food wasn't enough, the people were amazing. Chris and Bonnie were so fun! The atmosphere was amazing and the service impeccable, I only wish it was closer. We can't wait to come back with our whole family!"}
{"text":"We're fairly new to the area and just discovered Hash Kitchen today - thank you Instagram!  We were looking for a place to go for brunch and I think we may have found a new favorite!!  The menu has a wide variety of creative breakfast and lunch items, coffee and espresso drinks, Mimosas, and even a Bloody Mary bar if you want to create your own.   We really enjoyed our choices - chilaquilies, a chorizo frittata and a build your own scramble, all served with fresh biscuits and hash potatoes.  Our server, Justin, was very friendly and attentive and the atmosphere feels modern and fun.  We had such a hard time deciding what to eat we can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"There's a huge Bloody Mary bar and the gf ordered the house bloody which she wasn't a fan of. I on the other hand fully enjoyed my OJ and Coffee bundle. The food is absolutely delicious! If you're in the area I certainly recommend stopping in for a bite in the AM. It was definitely crowded and we waited about 20 mins for a table (this was before people rushed in like the gates of Mordor were opening)."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding. The service is friendly and competent. The hostess dresses to the nines and is very friendly and helpful. They have the best coffee."}
{"text":"Every bite was excellent
The French toast was wonderful
The carnitas , chicken and waffles, caprese Benedict, the scrambler , breakfast Popsicles, cannoli donuts wow"}
{"text":"I have been to Hash Kitchens multiple times before and they have all been a good experience but today I went to breakfast at the Frank Lloyd Wright location and had the pleasure of sitting at the bar with the Bartender Caleb. He was such a joy! So enthusiastic and full of energy. He kept me and my sister laughing the entire time. It's been awhile since I've had a better restaurant experience. Thank you Caleb for the laughs and great food! Will be back soon !!!"}
{"text":"Insanely good sweet potato and crab hash, followed by some delish and turbo charged coffee. Service was outstanding and the Sunday morning DJ topped off a gear experience!"}
{"text":"I don't get how a restaurant thinks its patrons want to come in at 10 am for breakfast and want to hear music blaring!! Way too loud for breakfast!! Im not going to a club. I walk in and there is a giant speaker pointed right at the tables. Does anyone actually enjoy this? I don't care how great the food is. Bad, obnoxious atmosphere for that time of day at a family establishment."}
{"text":"Such an awesome find!! This place is super fun and the food is amazing. The menu has a little bit of everything, and being gluten free I really appreciated the gf waffles and pancakes.

Definitely get the chiliquiles, AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Just an average food place with slow service. Had the chorizo hash and it had no flavor until I added hot sauce. The mimosa flight was a great try though."}
{"text":"This restaurant was everything we were looking for this morning! The most amazing Bloody Mary bar and the food was off the charts! I had the chicken and waffles which were amazing! We also enjoyed the chicken benedict, the carnitas hash and the avocado, tomato and mozzarella scrambler, all excellent choices! The kiwi mimosas were awesome!!! Amy was a great host and made us out-of-towners feel like we were at home. And if you get Gino as your waiter, you're in for a treat!!! We need one of these in both Pittsburgh and DC!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came on a Monday morning during a spring training vacation. The coffee was weak and the carnitas hash flavorless. The crab eggs benedict was very poor, too. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Alec our waiter was GREAT! He made recommendations that were spot on! I had the carnitas hash -fantastic! My hubby had the flat iron steak hash and LOVED it!  We'll be back on our next visit to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Our go to brunch spot! The bloody mary bar and mimosa flight is obviously what brings us in and the food is really good as well. Get the bruschetta. You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"New to our area and very good! Waited 30 mins on a Sunday morning but well worth it! DJ playing tunes which is fun,great service and food!"}
{"text":"My sisters and I had a wonderful brunch at THK with great and courteous service that went above and beyond to make our pre-wedding celebration a success! Delicious food and spot-on drinks! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Had the chance to try this brunch spot for the first time today.  The food was excellent and the atmosphere was equally impressive.  We chose breakfast items from a creative menu.

What set the experience apart was the fantastic service from an attentive waitstaff.  Welcoming and friendly, they go the extra mile.  Anthony at the bar will take care of you!  

As a side note, the make your own Bloody Mary bar is not to be missed.  This newer restaurant in Gainey won't disappoint!  I highly recommend The Hash Kitchen."}
{"text":"Delicious food! We got the corned beef hash skillet and it was amazing! The mimosas and bloody bar are awesome!"}
{"text":"YUM! This place was so good!! We ordered the breakfasts bruschetta, the almond coconut French roast, and the veggie omelette. The bruschetta was so cute and delicious. They had a strawberry and pastry cream of some kind, banana and Nutella, and Brie, fig, and bacon kind. All of them were so yummy, but the Brie bacon and fog was probably my favorite. The French toast was amazing. The bread was super thick and soft and it wasn't too sweet. The omelette was also perfect. It had asparagus, broccolini, and mushrooms! It came with potatoes and a biscuit. They were also good. It was my sisters birthday so they brought out a cannoli donut which also was delicious. It was a fried donut with cannoli cream on top. Our waiter Justin was really nice and funny! We will come here again!"}
{"text":"There's good and not so good here. Obviously the Bloody Mary bar is just over the top and amazing! There's more condiments offered at their Bloody Mary bar then anywhere else in town. And the price is just right. The wait is usually twenty to thirty minutes so grab a drink! The food is good not great. The only awkward feeling you get is when it's your turn at the hostess stand. We went two weeks in a row and both times a man and another man and woman are usually arguing or chatting between each other without acknowledging you. You can tell it's most likely the family that owns the restaurant so you want to forgive them but it's just a bizarre feeling. Like you want to say \"get it together!\" The service is mediocre, takes a few minutes to get someone to come over and a few more minutes to get drinks. Like I said, get yourself a Bloody Mary or two and it'll all work it just fine!"}
{"text":"Bad service. Bland food. It seemed like their very large wait staff was annoyed they had any customers at all. Potatoes tasted like they came from a frozen bag. Biscuit was covered in sugar. Eggs were fine, but overall this is what I would expect to eat from a buffet breakfast included in a hotel stay. The look of the restaurant is that as well. Plain. Boring."}
{"text":"50 STARS!!!! Probably my new favorite restaurant!!! The space is soooooooo beautiful, AMAZING food, and real great service. Stumbled in here for a late Thursday birthday brunch and had amazing time. Must try fried chicken egg Benedict, croque Madame, BACON, oh and did I mention build your own Bloody Mary bar??? Holy god, delicious. Make sure you ask for Chris for your server, he was so great, personable and fun. He uplifted our entire experience and is a huge asset to this restaurant! So great, we came back the next day. This is a must try spot, so get in here!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Crab Eggs Benedict and it was good but not fantastic. I saw the reviews and was looking to be wowed but wasn't. My dish did not look like the others on yelp. The crab meat seemed less than other in yelp and it did not have the garnish. The biscuit was good and the service was OK. Overall good but not great. It might have been an off day for them."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Loved the mimosa flight! Bonnie and Lona were so welcoming as we come from Buffalo, NY"}
{"text":"Really creative menu. They offer healthy options as well as fantastic hash bowls for those looking for morning after night out food. Love the delicious Bloody Mary bar and custom Mimosa flights! Delicious! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Brought my family to brunch today n I should have went with my gut and went to El Chorro. We called at 1130 and were told the wait was about 35 minutes so we drove 40 minutes there. We were given a pager and told it was 30 minutes. The odd thing was we kept seeing people come in after us and get seated. My annoyance started.  After we were seated it took a good 8 minutes to be acknowledged by a server. The food was mediocre, the service was off n then she over charged us and I had to correct her. Please keep your money or spend it elsewhere. The only lure here is the blood Mary bar."}
{"text":"Overpriced but good food for the most part. Service can take forever, so be prepared to wait while you sip your water or coffee. Ask for fresh potatoes (or crispy or hot) because they can be served cold sometimes. Otherwise, banana foster French toast is amazing, and the scramble/skillet things are good. Our fav is the monte Cristina sandwich, if you're looking for a little over the top menu item. Take out is also always on point, pleasant and efficient."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant out on a whim today. Amazing Bloody Mary bar (if you're into that), great mimosas, generous portions, great service, and reasonable prices. We will definitely be coming back to the Hash Kitchen next time we're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"If you want the best Bloody Mary experience you can't go wrong with Adrian- hands down best service I'll keep coming back for Scottsdale's best Bloody Mary!! Thanks Adrian and Hash Kitchen for having the best brunch in town! So glad I discovered this spot!!"}
{"text":"In from out of town and happened across this place looking up brunch locations. I was sold on pictures of a build your own Bloody Mary Bar, it didn't disappoint. \"Come for the Bloody Mary's but stay for the breakfast\". I had the carnitas hash and would definitely recommend it.  The service was great and I won't soon forget Bonnie the woman that greets you as soon as you walk in. Better than that she is a Buckeye fan! O-H.  When I'm in the area again I will be back."}
{"text":"Really great place with a creative breakfast menu. Excellent service as well. We went mid-morning (~10:30am) on a Wednesday. Not too busy and very nice ambiance. We brought our 9 month old son and were greeted with smiles!! Excellent food, lots of choices and not your everyday fare-but plenty of \"normal breakfast\" fare for the less adventurous as well. 
I can't wait to go back to try more!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but not GREAT. A bit expensive for me personally, but thanks to my employer I had a gift card. The girl at the bar ROCKS and is super sweet. There is NO LIQUOR LICENSE on the wall like is required by the state and city. They got fined for it a week ago in front of customers and still don't have it up."}
{"text":"Great food. Great experience. Bonnie was the best. You don't see service like that in restaurants anymore."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Coming from someone who has never posted a review!  The hostess dances in the aisles! Patrick, our waiter was awesome!  The food is spectacular.  The DJ and Music is off the hook!"}
{"text":"Yes yes and yes..I have become a breakfast foodie and  coffee snob over the years. This place is the shit!  Everything I have tried, has been spot on and cooked close to perfect with good quality ingredients! The coffee..is some of the best Italian made coffee around..either just the regular cups or if your with a coffee buddy GET THE FRENCH PRESS!! Beware if you come on weekends it's an hour wait if you are lucky. This place is in my top 3 in the valley for breakfast.  The patio is also dog friendly and faces north so it's never in direct sunlight."}
{"text":"We had some friends in town for the College Football Championship and needed a good Sunday brunch spot.  Being new to the area, we turned to Yelp.  First place I looked at was THK.  Great reviews, 4.5 stars and the food looked great, so we checked it out.  They do not take reservations, but we got there around 1 PM and we only had a 20 minute wait...and that was because we needed a table for 5.  

The wait was not a big deal because everyone got the BYOBM bar.  My goodness, you could just have that for the meal and with all of the toppings available, you could get full off of that.  No hassle trying to close a tab quick, they just add it to your table bill.  

The food was outstanding, just check out my pics...yum yum.  The regular coffee was very good and for the price, I am not even sure I would ever get the French press for $6.50.  

The restaurant has a trendy LA feel to it.  They even had a DJ playing music (he quit playing music at 1).  The staff was super friendly and welcoming.  

The only reason for the loss of a star...the waitress.  She was not horrible by any means, and was at least pleasant, but she forgot several drinks, never refilled my coffee, was scarce, and took a long time to bring anything to us or check on us.  I think half the reason I was still in a great mood is because everything else was so good.  I would recommend for a great Sat/Sun brunch experience."}
{"text":"You guys have done it again. Best breakfast burrito ever I really mean ever. And the fluffiest waffle. Plenty big to share both. Every time we dine here we have a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"What a fun atmosphere!  Sunday morning breakfast - music going at 10am.   Upbeat and energy...it's clear people working here really like their job.  

Bloody Mary Bar - can be intimidating, but absolutely do it!   Anything you can think of for a BM and they walk you through it.  

Split the huevos rancheros hash with my girl.  Great dish!  So much food we didn't even finish it!"}
{"text":"First time here and it's awesome! I'll be coming back. Food was amazing! Dominque was an awesome server! It's a must!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for brunch while on vacation. It's a very lively atmosphere. Lots of great options on the menu with hash dishes of course being the speciality. I had the Herb Fried Chicken Hash which runs around $14 and consists of potato hash / poached eggs / fried leeks / warm maple reduction and a boneless fried chicken breast. I asked that my eggs be scrambled with cheese. It was pretty yummy and honestly I probably could have shared based on the size. My friend let me taste her Corned Beef Hash and I enjoyed it. If you find yourself in the area, it's certainly worth a try. Overall I had a very positive first experience."}
{"text":"2 1/2 maybe.  Would I try again, yes.  The atmosphere and even the music is all good.  However, you guys rave like this is the best breakfast spot in Phoenix and Scottsdale.  It's not.  Tons of others places that are better just look on Yelp.  Every edge of the valley from Matt's downtown to the Farmhouse in Gilbert.  The service is terrible.  We saw our server when he took our order and when we got the check.  That's it and it was clear that he couldn't have cared less.  We wanted an OJ and mimosa plus an egg added to our tab but we couldn't get anyone to pay attention and stop for two seconds.  Now the food.  The chicken and waffles are overrated.  I liked the waffle but the chicken is actually very sweet.  Look, you already get maple syrup on the plate so no need to be excessive with the sugar angle.  The contrast is what makes chicken and waffles great.  Also, maybe use a slightly heartier piece of chicken instead of it being pounded so thin or whatever it is you're doing.  Chilaquiles, spelling?, actually pretty good but not close to traditional but everybody has their take on a dish so it is what it is.  Maybe less chicken over the top.  Now the Bloody Mary bar.  Boy, this must be your profit center.  What a waste of money.  Low quality vodka with either a mild or spicy tomato base and profile.  Lots of crap you can add for garnish but you're missing one key element.  A great Bloody Mary is about the spices and flavors in the mix and yours is bland at best.  This is not a Bloody Mary bar as much as it is a garnish bar.  Throw some garlic powder, onion powder, a couple hot sauces etc up there so you can change the taste of the base because it needs help. The place is packed and it's a good  location but two breakfasts, two drinks, an OJ and we are at $75.  Look at my reviews and you'll see that I have actually never mentioned price because I am happy to spend money on a great meal and experience.  This was not worth it.  Plus, I eat at great breakfast joints all over the west coast.  Also, my reviews are a majority excellent reviews not bad ones,  I feel it's important to not only complain about a bad experience but give people credit when they do a good job.  Go for yourself but gotta tell you that we are in no rush to go back here."}
{"text":"This is possibly one of the most creative breakfast options that I've ever seen. There is something here for everyone. My friend and I were in town visiting and eager to get off of our resort for a good meal (preferably with a good mimosa on the side). 

We arrived and immediately were greeted by super friendly staff. The restaurant has lots of space including indoor and outdoor seating options. 

We opted to order the order the mimosa flight. So awesome! And such a great deal if you are a fan of mimosas. Just perfect and the presentation makes it even better. The hash options seem endless. I ordered the Mexicana scrambler and was impressed from the beginning until the end. 

When I next return to Scottsdale, I just may go straight from the airport."}
{"text":"Amazing! The energy is always on point here. Very pleasant staff. Bonnie really made us feel special. Phenomenal Bloody Mary bar with excellent vodka choices (cilantro lime and cucumber especially) They have a bomb vegan option too! 

*Vegan* 
Huevos rancheros: 
No egg
No cheese
No carne 
No crispy onions
Add extra avocado 
Tortilla instead of biscuit"}
{"text":"We love spending a morning with Bonnie and her team at Hash Kitchen! The coffee is strong and perfect. The Bloody Mary bar is awesome! We've tried so many things on the menu, and we've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"We came on New Years Day and at first we were very impressed! The atmosphere is very particular, I kind of enjoyed it, it was different! And actual DJ. The menu looked so tasty, and our friend had a flight of mimosas waiting for us, and the peach mimosa was to die for!

Our waitress, Danielle - was very kind and very helpful! Great at recommendations, super friendly!

And then it kinda went downhill. The food was okay but overpriced for what we got. My friend subbed in a side of fruit and literally got 2 small wedges of cantaloupe and a small wedge of pineapple. The first thought that came to our minds was... really? And then we saw that it was 2.50. Bummer.

One of the older gentle-ladies in a gold sweater was incredibly grumpy and kinda ruined it because I felt bad for anyone who was taking orders from her. I could see it on the staffs faces. We didn't directly interact with her, but a grump is hard to ignore. The table next to us even commented on it, and I think maybe they did interact with her. As someone who has worked from the lowest position up it's always kind of a disgrace to see management be rude to their staff because you could tell they were doing the best they could on what was probably a short staffed day due to hangovers. I truly hope it was just a messy day that wasn't reigned it and this isn't the norm for customers and staff to witness.

Overall, it was okay, but not something I handed my card over to pay for thinking it was totally worth it.

I'll miss that peach mimosa though."}
{"text":"Excited to try for first time, heard good things
Pulled up, tons of people in the parking lot drinking bloody mary's
Asked how long for 4, response 45-55 minutes. As I was handed my buzzer by the nice older gentleman taking the names, a rude older woman ordered me to not put the buzzer in my pocket. I said, I've got at least an hour to wait why does it matter.
Forget this place. Not worth wasting your time. First impressions are everything, they should get rid of the old lady."}
{"text":"Walked in to club music with a DJ and turntable. A lively, fun atmosphere. Call me a grouch, but I'm not looking for a ton of fun with my breakfast. I really like the menu and it has everything you want. I got the choose your own frittata, which I haven't seen before. Mine had smoke salmon, spinach, and tomatoes. It was good although when I think lox, I think smoke salmon. Here it is just cooked salmon which is smoked because they own the BBQ place next door. Hashbrowns are just diced potatoes in a cup, they were ordinary. The fruit cup instead of the biscuit cost $2. The clincher, which I have read in other reviews is I couldn't get more coffee. Maybe I should have been dancing,  waving my empty coffee cup."}
{"text":"A business breakfast could not have been more enjoyable.  Whoa.  An awesome menu.  Get out of the same old same old rut and try this place.  Table of 4 had all different things.   This is a go to place."}
{"text":"Great brunch! I've been to both HK locations and have to say the staff at this one are a lot friendlier than the other location. But the food at both is always delicious and you and really can't beat mimosa flights or the ridiculously huge Bloody Mary bar. I love the atmosphere at this HK location and will definitely be back again for more brunch deliciousness."}
{"text":"The food is a nice deviation from typical breakfast options. (Although not as scrumptious as Cuttlefish was). Where they are slipping is their service which , at best, is inconsistent. Also frowned at the servers who brought out hot plates with their sleeves stretched. Ick. Get a napkin or some potholders. Overall, a nice attempt. I'll give it another go, but the finesse is missing."}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago, my hiking group came her to nosh after doing a trail run at Tom's Thumb even if it was a bit of a drive from there. They have a long but narrow patio and they were so gracious to accommodate my black lab, Arya, who came with us. She was too big to bring over the patio fence and there was no way I'd ask to walk her through the restaurant but our waitress brought iced water to her throughout our meal. Arya luckily was able try some of the flaky biscuits they brought to us and she \"tells\" me they were great!

The lump crab hash over sweet potatoes was very, very good! I'm a sucker for crab and there was plenty of crab in this dish. I enjoyed the food with an espresso and a house Bloody Mary. One of my friends really enjoyed the Bloody Mary bar which obviously gives you the opportunity to personalize how you like you cocktail. 

I definitely miss Cuttlefish, and I know it's the same owner but Hash will definitely be a go-to for weekend and post hike brunches from now on."}
{"text":"I am baffled and I do mean BAFFLED there are multiple locations of this disaster zone. I have been there twice and both times it has been completely inedible. The last time I was there was for a business meeting and when they put the plate down in front of me I could smell the salmon in the eggs Benedict was completely rancid. Rancid! It was a Herculean feat not to puke while the putrid fish sat on the plate in front of me. So as not to offend my host I attempted to eat around the fish but everything else was covered in mounds of raw onions. Bless the hundred-year-old coffee server lady for filling my cup every 37 seconds otherwise I would've starved to death that day."}
{"text":"Get your Hash on!  Love this brunch place.  One of my favorite breakfast places in Scottsdale.  They have a huge Bloody Mary Bar and they have a DJ on the weekends.  The energy of this place is amazing...  The food was also top notch.  I recommend the S'mores French Toast which is graham cracker brioche / nutella / charred marshmallow fluff.  This was a massive dish.  You get the crunch of the cracker with the char of the marshmallow fluff with the nutella taste on the back end.  Super rich super awesome!  The next thing you must get since the place is called Hash Kitchen you have to get the Herb Fried Chicken which is potato hash / poached eggs / fried leeks / warm maple reduction.  The fried Chicken had a nice crisp crunch and a juicy white meat center, then you get the taste of the egg yolk, and then you get the sweet of the warm maple syrup.  Boom Sweet and Salty in one dish!  The only knock would be the service was ok.  The waiter did not come around enough to fill up our cups and check in on us for what we needed.  Overall, if you are about to go out to a pool party or go party at some happy hour later go to Hash Kitchen to get you amped up!

{"text":"This by far beats any other breakfast place! If you go, ask for Gino. One of the most friendliest people you'll ever meet. The food was better than described on the menu. Definitely will be back more often!"}
{"text":"2 1/2 hour from our wait to get a table, wait for food  & drinks to come, check... super crowded for the space. Not sure worth it, plenty of places in Scottsdale to enjoy a perfectly beautifully Sunday. Food was decent & service friendly though"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Hash kitchen for its delicious food for breakfast or lunch, and this year we were pleasantly surprised with a Christmas brunch that topped the day! Starting with lovely choice of mimosas to such festive and  tasty brunch choices ! The lemon ricotta pancakes melted in your mouth, as well as the special holiday French toast and scrambled egg omelet! The servers were so busy and yet so friendly and added to,the lovely ambience! Loved it all!"}
{"text":"I really want this place to be great. My third time here and orders were not delivered accurately all three visits . Waiters seem overworked but definitely trying hard to keep up with an unreasonable number of tables to cover. Wait for food was too long every visit. 

The food is fine, but the atmosphere is confusing and awkward. Management has fixes to make fast or this place will fail"}
{"text":"Food is good, service is mediocre and it is loud, so if you are into that this is the spot! Awesome Mimosa flight and bloody mary bar- Hash was delicious."}
{"text":"Was in town for the weekend and my BFFs birthday. We wanted a yummy brunch and bloody marys and this place looked to have both. Bonus, it was a Bloody Mary bar with tons of fixings!

There was a bit of a wait, but it wasn't bad. Maybe 10 minutes. We ordered the Bloody Mary bar right away. It was fun to add all the extra goodies in there. There were lots of pickled vegetables, bacon, olives, and even meatballs and fried ravioli. The actual drink was very good too.

Then we ordered the Hash Monkey for a starter. It was soooo yummy. Buttery and gooyey and sweet and warm. 

We were sort of full-ish due to all the extras in our Bloody Marys, so we decided to share an entree. We asked our server for some recommendations and he said he always orders the Carnitas Hash. It was one of the items we were eyeing so we decided to get that. Oh my goodness. It was delicious! The carnitas were so tender and flavorful, the green chili sauce was amazing! I love a good green chili sauce and Hash does it right! The avocados, the cojita, I mean, it was perfect. 

We then decided we had to have a mimosa too and we each chose a different one. They were equally divine. If I'm ever back in Scottsdale, this place is on the list to go back to."}
{"text":"Very disappointed brunch Saturday 3/10 did not come close to living up to expectations or recommendations. While the Bloody Mary bar did indeed have lots of things to add, the pour of vodka (paid extra for Tito's) was painfully light. In fact she free poured  two drinks side by side and they were not comparable.  The frittata was over cooked and chicken tikka bland. Server knew her \"script\" to up sell but did not provide true attentive service. Will take a lot to choose to give them another chance. Maybe grew too-quickly to ensure quality"}
{"text":"Went for Saturday brunch, and was stoked the second I walked in: live DJ, hip decor, friendly staff, and a massive DIY bloody mary bar. 

Then I saw the menu... and my mind was blown. A huge selection of classic breakfast favorites with innovative flavor twists and creative combinations. 

My group ordered and before we knew it our table was covered in deliciously beautiful works of culinary creations.

Heaven.

Then we started eating... and it was good... don't get me wrong, but the ambiance and the flare set the bar so high that when I realized the flavors were lacking... I nearly cried. 

That's the only issue... the flavors lack. Not bad. But just weak.

The Chicken and Waffles: covered in fried leeks and came with a \"bacon waffle\"... sounds awesome right? Looks awesome too. But two bites in we had to order more maple syrup to coax a little life out of it.

(Also the chicken itself was pitiful in size, but looking at other reviews it looks like we just had an off batch)

The Berries Pancakes, \"stuffed with local fresh berries\", was a regular stack of pancakes... with a spoonful of berries on top, and maybe 2 blue berries in each cake.

The Lump Crab and Sweet Potato Hash: which we were told by the waiter was one of the most popular items, was a basic hash, topped with a few peices of crab meat and two perfectly (I'll give them that) poached eggs, with a depressingly weak drizzle of aioli... good, but nothing to write home about.

The Scrambles: as good as most, the unique combo of ingredients failed to create a unique experience though. Also... the bowl of non-crispy potatoes served with them? Maybe it's the new style... but I personally would vote for a few more notches of crispy.

Anyway... i try hard to rate places on what they are, and not my own experience. For this place, I feel like they are trying to be a hip and modern eatery that pushes the boundaries of breakfast dogmas with unique flavors and creativity... that is what I experiecned, saw, and felt... but not at all what I tasted."}
{"text":"Always great food. Have been here multiple times and have been impressed with the food every time. It busy on the weekends but if you go during the week, you don't wait."}
{"text":"Very cool and hip place with a lot of interesting people.

I ordered the flat iron steak and eggs. Medium steak was cooked perfectly. It was very soft, moist, juicy and delicious.  Best breakfast steak plate around for 17 bucks. The steak sauce was not needed.

The grilled green shishito peppers were a nice touch.  It's only mildly spicy.

Hashbrowns were great too."}
{"text":"Great food, good vibe, good service and local in my area. Very much appreciated the dining experience. I will definitely consider my return patronage in the short to medium-term future."}
{"text":"Average...a lot of out of towners come here. They used to have good service and visually appealing food presentation. The past month or so it seems they changed the menu. Food doesn't look as good/is simpler. Also the nice servers have been replaced by ones that seem rushed. They seem to try to turn over tables quickly...also I ordered something today and they brought out something similar but different. I didn't want to ask to correct it, because they were all rushing around and I figured it would take too long. I was very disappointed 

Last visit, I tried the Cristina green corn tamale cakes which were wonderful. Green corn tamales have been my favorite for almost 20 years and I try them at every restaurant that happens to have them on the menu...these ones with a little shredded meat and a  poached egg were some of the best in my opinion.

The only bad thing I have to say is that I got hot green tea and the little teapot they bring out is impossible to pour without spilling it. It got all over the table :'("}
{"text":"I've been here once. It gets 4 stars because Im a Bloody Mary snob and I wasn't blown away. I went for the Bloody Mary bar experience, which is pretty cool. For $10 you pick your vodka, rim flavor and have an assortment of 30 goodies to add in your bloody, like bacon, olives, cheese. My boyfriend liked it and wants to go back, I'm debatable."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!  I've been going twice a month since being referred! 

The food is AWESOME and the  older lady who works there, dances to the loud music and makes it feel like a hip and groovy night club! 

The atmosphere is very upbeat!! I loved the Lemon Ricotta pancakes and the flight of Mimosa's

Definitely recommend going here for breakfast especially if you have visiting guest in town! 

I noticed that they are building this establishment in Chandler but due to the dancing older lady, I'll continue going out to the Scottsdale location"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!!!!!!!!! Went Saturday for our family Mother's Day Brunch. Since Saturday I've told 10 people about this place already. Live DJ, super awesome bloody mar bar, bottomless mimosas with different flavors. I tried all of the flavors and I was feeling great! All types of walks a life here very very diverse. The DJ played old school dance hits. Food was impeccable, I had the Herb chicken and waffles. Great choice, chicken was moist waffles were nice and crisp. The servers were great managers kept checking in on us, very well priced! Can't wait to go back with my friends and REALLY enjoy that bottomless bar!!"}
{"text":"Ok here it is. Went today for the first time, just driving by. To start- the friendliest people in the world. Then we had the bloody  Mary bar, killer. I've had this at like 4 other places but this is the best ever!  Mimosas - out of this world. 

Food, I had a skillet, someone had eggs Benedict, chicken and waffles and a croch monsure (spelling. ??) - everything was out of this world. This kitchen is killing it!!!! 

But it gets down to the staff, some of the nicest I have ever met in a restaurant. 

Go and enjoy! 

Thank you for a great meal."}
{"text":"Aaahh, the bloody mary bar...I'll never forget you! :) Oh, and the food was fantastic too!"}
{"text":"Great service. I would highly recommend the Bloody Mary bar! The huevos rancheros hash was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Up Beat Scene With Loud Music and Tons Of People!

Good music is super loud and make this sort of like having lunch in a upbeat club more than a restaurant. It's a cools place and our server was from Rhode Island I believe and he was cool, but swapped with a table of more than 30 which made him never stop running around!

I had the Huevos Rancheros Hash or something close to that name... It was good, nice portion size and good presentation. 

I also had the Breakfast Brushetta which is definitely just a snack! Probably not worth the $8 for it since it's pretty small but the presentation is good and would make a good addition to coffee with friends....

I met the general manager who seemed friendly while we were there. I am guessing the older lady with the super fun upbeat personality is the store manger. Everyone was friendly and I can see why this place is buzzing. 

We even had carolers singing Holiday Rap Songs to us on the patio which was unexpected but amusing. 

All in all, this is. cool spot to hang out and get a bite."}
{"text":"Very little flavor.  Carrot cake pancakes were a disappointment.  The cakes were tough and flavorless.  The only thing qualifying it as carrot cake was shreds of carrot.   The syrup tasted  like Mrs Butterworth...not real maple syrup.  The cream cheese was the only good thing.  The Christinas Tamale cakes (a benedict) was boring ... no spice to the green chile.  The side of potatoes were ouly and flavorless.  It looks like the real draw to this place is the bloody mary bar.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! It was our first time here and the food was incredible. We will definitely be returning. 5/5 stars. I will highly recommend for a good brunch.

Our service was excellent as well! Our server, Jesus, was so attentive and kind. We literally didn't have to ask him for anything because he was on top of everything we needed throughout our whole dining experience.

Overall, the service and food was fantastic. Please give this place a chance!"}
{"text":"Great food and service similar to other location in north Scottsdale.  Yet our was waitress was the best!  I hope to get her on my next time back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and drinks! They have a DJ there for weekend brunch-so fun! Our waitress Katie was great. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Amazing! We have wanted to try this place for a while now. The minute we walked in we felt comfortable.  Gino was our server and he definitely went above and beyond. He put our son 1st and got him a bowl of fruit. He ran down the menu and gave us recommendations. We will be coming back and trying the cannoli donut the next time! Thank you for fantastic food and service!"}
{"text":"I was excited to have a new breakfast spot nearby. Wow, totally disappointed. Walked in on a rainy Thursday, & right away hated the atmosphere. It's loud ( even though it was only half full), feels cold, chair made me feel like I was going to slide off. Chair was wet, table had water laying on it. Ordered corned beef hash w/ poached eggs. Eggs were over cooked, corned beef was skimpy & boring. Potatoes were just ok. Biscuit was pretty good, but had to ask for jelly. Hubby had huevos ranchero. Should be named boring huevos, thought it might be spicy, but was disappointed.  And, they must find the smallest eggs on the planet.( think quail) 
Too bad I don't like this place, it would have been convenient. Guess we'll just go to Butters where the service & food are better as well as reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I was beyond excited to see a new Hash Kitchen, opened in my neighborhood! They make the BEST bloody mary's, with their own in-house infused vodkas. I had the coconut almond French toast & Vinny had the Carnitas Hash (both absolutely delicious) I wanted to try multiple things on their menu. That just means I'll be back many more times. I forgot to catch our waiters name (very tall, brown hair) but he was very friendly & humorous. I love this spot. Their patio is a tad small but has nice seating. Welcome to the neighborhood!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!! They accommodated our large (loud) group well. Amazing food. Great service. Next time I come to town, I can't wait to come back. Thank you from Booktini. And Bonnie is legit."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! The cannoli doughnuts are amazing as well as the chicken and waffles. Would highly recommend. Linda at the front is awesome and will do all she can to be sure you are satisfied with your meal."}
{"text":"We try to do a new place with our non-meating friends every so often. They had tried this place before and invited us to join them. 

It's in the old Cuttlefish building in North Scottsdale. Decor is modern farm to table...trendy. The menu is severely meat friendly. But there are some shrimp and salmon options, as well as the waffles and pancakes. And the every ubiquitous bacon bandwagon. 

The coffee was strong and very tasty. But my cup was left empty several times and I actually had to get up and get it myself 2 times. Which is odd because when we needed service, it wasn't there, however, when we were still eating, bus boys kept trying to take our plates away...without asking. We had to verbally stop them 3 times total \"No, I'm not finished eating yet!\". Same with the water glasses, always empty. 

I ordered the artichoke fritata. Very dry and flavorless and came to the table not hot, not warm, but kind of on the room temperature side. I rarely put salt on any food I order, so when I have to salt my food, I feel like there's no inherent flavor to enjoy. And several of the artichoke bites were the chewy stem parts so i had a little side pile of artichoke chew and spit outs. 

Felt rushed with sub par food."}
{"text":"Recently, my father and I were looking for a different place to eat brunch on a Saturday morning.  While we expect there to be a long wait for a good brunch on Sundays, it was a surprise to us to find a 45 minute or so wait on a Saturday.  While this was certainly longer than we would have wanted, the Hash Kitchen staff made sure we were comfortable with small cups of juice and tastes of one of several DELICIOUS starters.  I tried a piece of brunch bruschetta with fig jam, warm brie, and thick bacon.  I so look forward to actually ordering this in the future.  

Both my father and I felt like a Scrambler, where we both ordered Thick Cut Bacon Scramblers (potatoes, onion, swiss cheese) served with hash potatoes and a warm buttermilk biscuit (or toast).  Clearly, I am my father's son!  The food was tasty and well worth the wait though the service itself could have been better.  Our server was helpful though she clearly had too many tables to watch over.  

Hash Kitchen has some great specials from weekday $3 craft mimosas, weekday $5 bloody mary bar, and Kids Eat Free Mom Mondays.  Also, if you check in on Yelp, you get 5% off your bill even on the weekend!  While I would prefer not to wait so long for a table, I definitely have every intention to have brunch at the Hash Kitchen in the future."}
{"text":"First time going here today. Waited for almost 40 minutes for our order...our ticket got lost in the kitchen but they weren't even busy. The lady gave us some donuts on them while we still waited...finally the food comes out & I'm eating my pancakes when I realize there is a long black hair mixed into the pancakes DISGUSTING!!! Never going back."}
{"text":"We had s very easy time getting in and they were able to accommodate my daughter's special needs stroller! The lady with grey hair is super amazing and wonderful! She loved my girls and was very friendly!  Great service!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Love that they have a DJ. Service incredible and of course the bloody Mary bar is so fun. I chose cilantro lime tequila. Yaaas! All of our meals were awesome, our group had eggs benedict, blackened shrimp hash...I had veggie scrambled and the fluffy eggs, delicately saute veggies were quite tasty. Obv5a great chef staff here. My other friend had the puffy dutch type pancake, which I tasted and it was great. Next time I come back, I'll prob get coconut french toast. My other friend had salmon benedict and that looked great too."}
{"text":"I just didn't think this place lived up to the hype. I think the only reason you would want to come here is for the Bloody Mary bar thing which was really cool. The food was okay not really I got the huevos rancheros hash and it had this weird sauce that just threw it all off. My cousin got the pancakes which were okay, but honestly how wrong can you ever go with pancakes!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a huge disappointment. We arrived on a Monday morning at 11:30 and were told it would be a half hour wait despite the fact that there were numerous empty tables and not many people ahead of us. We opted to sit at the bar since we were a little pressed for time. The bartender was visibly frazzled and said they were very short staffed. I was brought watery iced tea with no straw and no sweetener and the bartender disappeared. We finally ordered and had a long wait for food which didn't look anything like the yelp pictures and was not even warm. We were told sorry for the wait but the frittata takes a long time which would explain why it was burnt and my hollandaise was dried up. Definitely an off day for this establishment!"}
{"text":"Best brunch in Scottsdale! We surprised my best friends little brother with his Nonna and dad visiting in town. We had a wonderful time and such amazing food! Bonnie was lovely and so sweet to our nonna  will be back a million times more!"}
{"text":"Yumo!  We came here on a Sunday for brunch.  The wait was only five minutes.  Started off with Hash cocktails, espresso and rum, need I say more?  The husband had a burrito and pancakes and I had the veggie scramble.  Both we good but the Mr. said his burrito was a little dry.  They have a DJ but the music isn't that loud.  If you are hungry and in area try it out."}
{"text":"This was pretty much the highlight of our Sunday Funday in Scottsdale.  Such an amazing atmosphere, great décor, open air feel, delicious food, and a DJ spinning some awesome tunes doesn't hurt.  My husband kept saying, \"We NEED to open up one of these in Portland!\"  It really would fit in perfectly with Portland's brunch-culture.  The ONLY thing this place could have used is a bottomless mimosa option a la Brix in the Pearl District of Portland.  If I was a Bloody Mary fan, the make-your-own Bloody Mary bar would have been right up my alley.  Definitely a place we'd come back to next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"The Hash Kitchen provides a delicious yet engaging culinary experience. The Bloody Mary bar is unlike anything I have ever seen before where you can choose from over 40 different toppings and custom create the cocktail yourself. I would also highly recommend the Red Velvet pancakes, a breakfast treat that is not overly sweet and well worth the calories. The Owners, Joey and Cristina are all about customer service and making sure everything exceeds expectations."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with a friend .  Chris was our waiter and he gets 5 stars as well! very nice and very attentive.  He saw that it was my birthday from a birthday card I had lying on the table and he came back with a free birthday dessert for me!  I had the berry pancakes with a side of bacon and a vanilla latte....sooooo good! I couldn't eat another bite the pancakes were huge and filling.  I believe there were 4 of them with 3 pieces of bacon.  Nice ambiance also, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious place for brunch. We went here after hiking camelback and had the lemon ricotta pancakes and the lump crab and sweet potato hash. Both were absolutely delicious! Service was great! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This breakfast and Bloody Mary bar was spectacular!!!! Bianca was an awesome waitress and we had a blast! Thanks for everything!"}
{"text":"This review is for 2.5 stars.

I really wish the service was better.  Coming to Hash Kitchen, it had everything I could ask for in brunch - mimosa varieties, bloody mary bar, tons of dishes, and dog friendly-patios.  Once we arrived on New Year's Day, and the line was about 20 groups deep at 12:30pm, then we knew were in for a morning.  

We finally got seated about 30 minutes later.  Outside as we had requested.  So far so good.  Upon seating, it took 20 minutes and 2 separate times of requesting service just to get our water glasses.  10 minutes later a waiter comes out to serve us.  We get our meal in and we're off.  Solid mimosa flight comes out immediately so we can at least get boozing.  Daily selection of 4 fruits, with the blueberry and kiwi standouts.  30 more minutes pass until our food comes.  I ordered a hash skillet with corned beef and side of sausage.  I had requested sweet potato hash, but apparently our waiter said that the chef 'couldn't find' the sweet potato hash so no go.  Undercooked corned beef hash and overcooked sausage let to a below average meal.  The frittata the person I dined with was hefty and loaded with egg, but not much more than a hungry man breakfast.  Although, the biscuits are a must if you do happen to go to Hash Kitchen after this review.  We finally got our check and left after almost 1:45 meal time.

The best part was that everybody in our section was complaining one after another.  In the entire time we were there, we saw 4 different waiters serve a total of 5 tables outside.  One couple left after a few bites as they were so fed up.  Another table complained at least 4 or 5 times before a waiter finally served them.  And then there was a larger couple of about 15 that waited for the entirety of our meal just to be seated, with almost a dozen tables opened, yet unbussed, inside.  All the while the manager is sitting at the podium, definitely not managing this comedy of errors.

A fiasco of a brunch with just average, hit or miss food.  The drinks were good and the atmosphere of Hash Kitchen was so good coming in, but the service was just so mediocre that it leaves a bad taste in your mouth for any chance of dining in the future."}
{"text":"On a birthday vacation with my boyfriend and we did a quick google search for the best brunch spots in Scottsdale... We found Hash! Our expectations were high and Hash still surpassed anything we had anticipated! From the Bloody Mary bar to the home style food! Bonnie treated us like family! She even added a photo of Cyle to her athlete screen as you walk in the restaurant! She's SO cute! We're totally in love with the place and definitely will make a point of returning to eat during spring training next year!"}
{"text":"It was a Saturday and the sun was out. Everything was perfect then the food came out and bammm, it was Sooo good good times with a friend"}
{"text":"Wow! First time trying this place, amazing! The food was delicious!!!!!! So fresh and flavorable! Quick service, friendly. Our waiter Gino was wonderful, filled us in on the menu, very tenative,  and served us a taste of this amazing dessert in the end to try, a canoli donut!!! Omg to die for! The whole experience was amazing!  When we arrived it was pretty busy so the lady seating us put us outside my request, though it was very hot I changed my mind so she kindly set us up a comfortable booth, so sweet of her! Over all an amazing place, people and experience!!!!! Thanks Gino we will be back to see you!!!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I met here for brunch this past weekend and ehhhhhh is the word that comes to mind. My friends and I do a lot of brunches as this is how we meet and catch up on life so we've been to a ton of places. 

The service - fine. They forgot my friend asked no salsa add avocado
The food - it was good and tasty, they do have some fun items on the menu
The atmosphere - here's the thing ... if you're looking to have a conversation and be able to hear others at the end of the table ... I'd say forget it, we went Sunday at 11:30 and it was like a club in there, a DJ was going and everything. So that was a little bit of a bummer to leave with a horse voice. 

I'd go back again to see if maybe outside seating was available and I'd recommend for all to try and see if its something for them."}
{"text":"Great service from Jen! Breakfast was yummy. We had the chorizo hash and traditional corned beef hash. Jen was helpful and made suggestions and kept our coffee cups full!"}
{"text":"Fabulous place. Amazing wait staff. Excellent food!! Bottomless mimosas are the main draw for me but the rest is the icing on the cake. 
Ask for Jen to be your server. She met all our needs and we were a little needy.."}
{"text":"Upscale breakfast brunch spot. Nice hotel like atmosphere.  Creative menu executed well in slow weekday morning. Great biscuit and superb coffee. Need to work on potatoes. Need to be hotter, fresh off grill  service by waiter very good but floor management lacking,  l will come back to try the waffle."}
{"text":"A must visit place in Scottsdale...Bonnie is amazing, the food and atmosphere are comfortable and inviting!!!"}
{"text":"Crab and sweet potato hash was amazing!  A little bit too many bell peppers but tasty.  Corned beef hash was good too, but I like mine shredded and cooked more.  My 12 year old took on the stack of 4 pancakes, but food won.  Bloody Mary bar looked interesting but no hangovers in our party.  Dance music was a little loud but conversation was not impossible."}
{"text":"Awesome hip breakfast joint! Took my grandma and mom here over the weekend when all our other options were packed, and we were all super happy to discover this place! The coolest part is the huge build your own Bloody Mary bar. I do not like bloody Marys, but I thought the variety of things they had to add to it was so neat.
It was pretty busy on a Saturday morning, but the three of us were seated pretty quickly. The menu has quite a few options, and luckily for me some great vegetarian stuff! I got a build your own scramble, you get to pick three things (cheeses, meats, veggies). I ordered my scramble with broccolini, spinach, and avocado. My mom also got a build your own scramble, and my grandma went all out and got the cannoli pancakes. We were oogling at other peoples dishes as they were being brought out. Everything looked amazing! Especially those donut things, making a return visit for that. My scramble was delicious, I loved it. The fresh biscuit it came with was good too, and I'm usually not a huge fan of biscuits. The hash potatoes were yummy but I prefer mine a tad more crispy. I don't like cannolis so I did not like my grandmas pancakes, but she loved them! My mom liked her scramble too, although the artichokes turned her scramble brown which worried us at first sight haha. Service was good too! We were all pleased."}
{"text":"I think this is my new favorite brunch places to go to now! The energy of the restaurant brings people in, such as their DJ, this older lady, which I'm assuming was the manager- dancing by the door (totally cute!), and service was great! I ordered their coconut toast (recommended by the waiter) but it was okay, I'm just picky when it comes to coconut. I'm not a big fan of coconut flakes sprinkled on my toast. Their mimosa flight was unique. I would definitely recommend this place to locals around the valley for breakfast and brunch"}
{"text":"Came in on Saturday morning. The place was very busy inside but no one was outside. We were seated outside and I know why no one was out there because the misters were extremely wet and constant....almost felt like taking a steam shower.

Ordered a non spicy Bloody Mary that was bad. Extremely salty and spicy....didn't say anything to waiter but didn't drink much of it either.  My husband had a mimosa and he said it was great.

My husband ordered a side of hash potatoes and side of gravy. The potatoes were pretty bland and mushy - I am thinking they were frozen.  Would expect more if Hash is in the restaurant name. We also shared an order of Chilaquiles.  They were OK. Nothing special and nothing I would order again.

Nice atmophere inside and out. Good vibes.  I think we just ordered the wrong stuff. We will come back and give it another try!

Plenty of parking all around."}
{"text":"This morning came here for the first time. 
They have a very comprehensive menu for breakfast and brunch. Several kinds of hash, frittatas, egg benedicts and much more. 
We ordered a smoked salmon hash, a fried chicken hash, a broccolini frittata, a BYO scrambled eggs. The food was delicious. Most of the dishes come with a generous helping of diced potatoes. The servings are generous. I would give the food an easy 4 stars. 
However a basic tenet of full disclosure was violated by the staff. The broccolini frittata came out with broccoli rather than broccolini. Most of us know that while the names are similar there is a big difference between broccoli and broccolini. We were not told that broccolini was not available and the kitchen conveniently made the substitution hoping it would not be noticed. 
When this was pointed out to the server there was no mea culpa. A little while later the hostess came to inquire if everything was okay. When informed of the substitution her response was something to the effect that Sysco did not deliver broccolini. Didn't seem to care much. So 2 stars for absence of full disclosure followed by apathy."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in Arizona hands down. The paella hash is basically perf. On top of that the mimosa flight and Bloody Mary bar are crazy good. Like amazing good and worth visiting just for that"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Weezer - Hash Pipe)

I can't help my hunger, I'll go out of my mind
This kitchens got it going cause I like their breakfast
I can't love my singing if I can't get a drink
Down some Bloody Mary's at a bar that I make

Ohhh, come on and make me
Ohhh, come on and make me
Whoa...!
Come on and make me
Whoa...!
You've got some olives
Whoa...!
I want some peppers
Whoa...!
You've got some big pours
Right at the Hash Kitchen


A former seafood restaurant The Hash Kitchen is now a head on Breakfast/Brunch restaurant with some fun flares!

I came here after a hike; my friend had her pup so we requested to be sat outside on the patio.  Needless to say, they were happy to oblige....yah!  As we walked pass the restaurant the place was hoping; I'm not sure if it was because of the PHX Open, but there were a lot of patrons along with a live DJ.  One thing noticeable about this place is the round Bloody Mary Table -- it's a MIY Bloody Mary bar!  

To start I ordered the French Press coffee with the Smoked Sliced Brisket & Corn Beef Hash.  Of course I had to do the Bloody Mary bar!  I selected the Siracha Bloody Mary with Vodka; stuffing it with celery, baby corn, carrots, peppercini peppers, jalapenos, olives, bacon, and beef jerky.  I couldn't stuff it anymore at some point cause I would have!  Needless to say, it was fun and yum at the same time.  Moreover, I got the entire canister of the French Press coffee!  My hash came with green peppers and a poached egg on top.  I thought it was pretty basic, but still good.  I wanted some texture hoping the hash would be somewhat crunchy.  

In the end, I gave this place my best because the ambiance was popping and the service was impeccable!  The place catered to my friends pup and our server kept coming out to serve him water too!  We were constantly asked if we need more of this or that and our waters kept full!  We had one main server, but managers and bussers came to our attention without a hitch.  Definitely my new favorite spot for breakfast! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a relatively new experience for us:  Scottsdale in the morning, kids, and trying something new.  I think if you are a 20-something without kids and don't mind shouting at your friends for an entire meal, this is a decent place.  Food is creative, but taste falls a little flat.  So, I would rate the food was so-so, but service was prompt and friendly.  Saturday morning with a DJ (really?!) was very loud."}
{"text":"The Hash Kitchen is a pretty decent breakfast/brunch spot in North Scottsdale. I came here after a Saturday morning hike (ok, half hike if I'm being honest). We started with the Bloody Mary bar which was killer. I went with the habanero mix which is VERY spicy and delicious without the vinegar Tobasco taste. I rarely have a Bloody Mary that was actually spicy so it was nice. I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes, they were good but not great. I wish they had the ricotta mixed with the batter to give more flavor to the pancakes. They instead had a lemon ricotta mix served on the side, still tasty though. Service at the bar was fine, nothing to write home about, they were pretty busy so I didn't worry about it too much. The mimosa I had was pretty weak, I would skip it next time."}
{"text":"I always said I have a half-assed memory, maybe I need to correct that to a \"half-HASHED\" memory:  

I came to visit Hash Kitchen by way of a faulty memory.  I was visiting Scottsdale to see a concert and also visit with an old friend, who bought breakfast for the two of us.  A Yelp Friend of mine (in SoCal) had highly recommended a place I mistakenly remembered as \"Hash Kitchen\"; I later discovered my YF's recommendation was for a place in San Diego and Las Vegas called \"Hash House a Go-Go\".  Oh well, I still need to \"Go-Go\" to that one, but the mistake turned out to be a good one!

Hash Kitchen is fantastic!  We ate there on a Sunday morning; they apparently have a brunch and had a P.A. set up, blastin' out some good tunes (don't know whether or not there was a DJ).  The place was lively.

SURPRISE!  (not really); the place has Hash on the menu!  Since that's in their name, it would stand to reason that it BETTER be good, right?  I had the Corned Beef Hash, and it certainly was.  Cubed Corned Beef with diced Hash Browns, with an over-easy egg perched atop the whole shebang, served in a cast iron skillet.  And with a biscuit I probably could've eaten a half-dozen of, at least.  Service was good, nice casual environment.

They have a lot more than Hash on the menu, I'm sure everything else is just as good.  Hash Kitchen is definitely on my short list of places to eat, next time I'm in the Scottsdale / Phoenix area.  I was told they plan on opening up a coupla more locations in the near future.  Please check 'em out!

Sidebar: I just noticed, I've had almost 175,000 views of my pics, over the last 90 days!  (174,949 to be exact)  I didn't even know Yelp tracked that sort of thing, and certainly never dreamed my pics could be that popular.  So, THANK YOU to all my loyal viewers!  I am humbled.  Sorry, no pictures this time, but now that I know they're getting that many views.  I'll take some next time.

{"text":"Since I really enjoyed their other location, I was really looking forward to coming here for brunch.

I make sure to visit here with a friend just to try their mimosa flight. $16 mimosa flight comes with 4 regular serving of mimosa. My favorite this time was cherry. All others were just okay. I still like their strawberry when they have one.

On Sunday, expect at least 30 mins to 45 mins wait. They will quote you approximately how long the wait, they have chairs and water outside to help you wait.

I tried lump crab Benedict. I had their lump hash before and wanted to try benedict this time. I would have preferred if they have more hollandaise sauce and just a bit more crab. Not really well balanced, at least more sauce would have been better. 

If you arrive late, they might run out of some of the dishes. I wanted to try their famous breakfast lasagna but I guess I need to start my day a bit early to try that next time.

Service here is always good. Despite of being really busy, they do well"}
{"text":"Mimosa flight... that's what I noticed while waiting for a table for breakfast and I had to try for myself. Four different mimosa is served and I liked all of them. It was a perfect way to start lazy weekend.

They have nice bar area, really liked Bloody Mary station, where you get to pick what you want for your drink.

DJ is there on weekend, creating fun ambiance. Nice and open design allows the music to play loud but still be able to carry a conversation without being too loud.

I tried lump crab hash for breakfast and really happy with my selection. Egg was cooked perfect, sweet potato hash went well with hollandaise sauce, I would order one again."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Service was excellent. We will be back! Portions are large- not a bad thing but good to know. Yum!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best brunch in Phoenix! Even  better staff, they accommodating my boyfriend and I plus 15 of our friend for a reunion brunch! We had such a fabulous time and the food was amazing! Our waiter was on point, we never waited for a refill on our mimosas! The Bloody Mary bar is epic, literally the coolest display of toppings I have ever seen! We were so pleased and will remember this day for long time! Thank you Hash Kitchen!"}
{"text":"A great place for a hearty & leisurely brunch! The carnitas hash are moist and delicious! The Bloody Mary is like a meal in itself. The monkey bread is crispy and moist at the same time, really tasty but not too sticky."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town for real! Very high quality ingredients, Great presentation, excellent service and the flavors of all the dishes were awesome! Corned Beef Skillet and Chilaquiles were insane!"}
{"text":"It's Adrian!!!!!  Not Andre. Adrian makes the best Bloodys and is a fabulous bartender!"}
{"text":"A wide, roomy dining room with high ceilings, choice of low or high tables or old fashioned booths. The menu offers hints of a well inspired chef, will have you agonize over traditional, i.e. pancakes or Benedict's, or elaborate fusion Euro-Latino, try the croque-madame.
Orange juice is real, fresh squeezed, service is friendly and efficient. We'll forgive them for the broken espresso machine, but can't wait to go back to experience more fine dishes."}
{"text":"You must try the Hash Kitchen...This is the best breakfast place in town!  I've gone back three weekends in a row. Normally, I stick with the same menu item when I find a good thing, but I have tried something different every time. There is something here for everyone, from healthy to decadent. Try the Salmon Benedict, one of the Hash Skillets or the Waffles! You really can't go wrong, everything I've tried is amazing and they have the best biscuits I've ever had! They even have French Press coffee. I can't wait to try their lunch. I saw a Chinese chicken salad go by that looked to die for. The Hash Kitchen does not disappoint and the staff and service was second to none! Exceptional all around!"}
{"text":"We thought we'd try the Hash Kitchen since we're staying in the area. The vibe upon entry was quite good, tunes via a DJ, which were not too loud. The menu didn't have pictures, so we had to ask the server for clarity on a couple items. The corn beef hash was pretty good, too many potatoes and not enough corned beef, but that was expected. Flavour was good, needed ketchup to help enhance the taste. My wife had the H'uevos Rancheros, she didn't like it whatsoever. I tried it, ditto. She left 75% of her meal. We've had it at other restaurants, always enjoyed it, not here. Service was decent."}
{"text":"3 stars for overall experience. The food ordered was actually very good (4.5 maybe even a 5). However, we got there around 10:20 and did not get to eat until 11:45. Because this is a popular brunch spot, my friend and I were expecting a wait. We checked on the hostess list after 20 minutes and then 35 minutes. Long story short, we waited almost an hour only to finally realize that the hostess crossed out our names by accident so that we were never going to be called. In a fast paced, very busy restaurant you need someone in the front who's organized and in charge. 

Our server was nice though and accommodating. We ordered the lump crab beni with avocado, chicken beni, and banana French toast. The lump crab was delicious. The amount of crab was impressive and the old bay hollandaise paired very well. My friend ate half of her chicken beni order before realizing that the kitchen forgot her hollandaise sauce. Minus star #2.

The banana French toast was heaven. The most perfect blend of flavors. I could eat that weekly. Both my friend and I were blown away.

All in all, I'm on the fence about returning. While the food is great and the mimosa flight was refreshing, I'm not sure it ends up being worth it."}
{"text":"the best new place in Scottsdale for breakfast and lunch. Food is very highly crafted, with first rate ingredients. The service is super friendly. We loved Chris, our waiter. He made spot on suggestions and gave us exceptional service. It is nice to see a private chef owned restaurant in this part of town . Hope they open for dinners soon too. loved the hostess. she made us very comfortable, even though we were coming from hiking, and had on work out clothes.
eggs benedict with crab and lemon pancakes were both excellent. 
chicken and waffles--perfect ! All the hash items were really well done too. great bloody Mary too !  2 visits in 2 weeks."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I'm so happy we found this spot while we stay a week In Scottsdale we will definitely be here every morning and can probably have something different every time! The restaurant is well designed and the owner is a very very nice woman. The staff is also extremely friendly and thorough with telling you about the items on the menu. Also they have some really great music playing. I'd definitely recommend this place to a friend!"}
{"text":"Man this place is really the best. I've now tried out both locations and I'm super pleased with both of them. This location has a beautiful outdoor eating area and just like the other location the staff and owner are extremely friendly. I love this place, I don't think I'll even bother with other breakfast spots in Scottsdale, this menu is so large you can have something different every time you come and it all tastes AMAZING. Seriously if you are in the north Scottsdale area you MUST try the hash kitchen!"}
{"text":"Bloody Mary bar was the bomb and made the time waiting to be seated this Sunday morning fly by in a flash. DJ was spinning vibrant tunes and we continued the Vitamin C fest with the Mimosa Sampler (OK, Grapefruit, Guava, Mango). Highly recommend the Buttermilk Herb Chicken Hash, Coconut Crusted French Toast and best Chilequiles I have had outside Mexico...Go..go now!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I had the French Toast, my wife had the Scramblers, and my daughter had the kids Eggs and Bacon.

It was easily the best Breakfast that we had while in Scottsdale, it was very nice and the staff was great, especially Bonnie. From what you hear there is a good chance of meeting celebrity sports figures here on a regular occasion.

I would recommend this to anyone who ask."}
{"text":"A-ma-zing Build Your Own Bloody Mary Bar! ANY type of hash is awesome. Run...don't walk... To try it. Sunday morning early before the crowd gets there!!!!"}
{"text":"A Hash Kitchen right by our house? Oh happy day! Only open a week, place is huge inside and a nice patio but people were still waiting to eat brunch today! Got chicken and waffles, honey got frittata and thick bacon, coffee the best! Coming back Sunday with a bunch of couples for Bloody Marys! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Lona, the bartender is the BEST! Always so friendly, helpful and smiley! She rocks the bar and makes everyone feel like home! The mimosas are the BOMB!"}
{"text":"Food was very good but the wait for it was crazy! Not sure it was worth the long wait"}
{"text":"I'm al at a very critical about the flavor of food. I don't like wasting time with something I can do at home. Additionally, I'm very observant of the customer service. Be professional and don't lose sight of my needs. 

This place is solid in both these areas. Definitely off the beat and path but good find if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Good service and fun upbeat environment. Went on a Sunday morning and it was packed. So be prepared for the possibility of a decent wait.( ours was about an hour). But inside there is a bar and a DJ which is pretty cool. Got the carnitas hash (since it is in the name of the restaurant) and it was good. The serving size is a medium sized dish but was perfect for a brunch. They have a wide variety of breakfast options.  A good place to check out for the environment in Scottsdale.  Will have to come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was overpriced and okay. 17 dollar dry frittata and 7 dollar virgin Bloody Mary, though the Bloody Mary was good. And they tried to buy a good review on yelp by offering a discount which might explain the good reviews that led me to try this place which was mediocre at best. Is that even okay? Buying yelp reviews?!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! We had the best server and the manager also took such great care of us, we were calling her \"Mama Linda\" by the end of our meal. Both our server and Mama Linda suggested the lemon ricotta pancakes and I haven't been able to stop thinking about them since we had them. My mouth is literally watering right now and I've told everyone how amazing these pancakes are!!! They have the best Bloody Mary bar I've ever seen, cheese sticks, pickled everything, and house made tomato juice. Besides the magical pancakes, we had the fried chicken Benedict, YES. The combination of the hollandaise sauce and maple syrup reduction was outstanding. Btw, we also had the cannoli donuts. #bestbreakfastEVER"}
{"text":"Read the hype on Yelp and I just don't get it. The food was very mediocre. Hash potatoes were so salty, they were in-edible. The veggie egg scramble with mushrooms, asparagus and broccolini, consisted of 1 mushroom and the root ends of the asparagus and broccolini. Not what I was hoping for. I will say the pancakes were good, as well as the service.
Glad we tried it, but will not go back."}
{"text":"First time here ...we sat at the outside bar ... counter was filthy.. I had to ask for it to be cleaned.  Got a mimosa .. the glass was so tiny, I drank it in two sips.  Server was pleasant, but not attentive, she also had her cell phone in her front Jean pocket... tacky..  Outside floor was not too clean... cig butts and food not swept up.  Food was average.  I will try one more time, but not too impressed."}
{"text":"Better than the best...from the fresh ingredients in food to the Bloody Mary make your own bar to the wait staff---had Ryan for waiter.....Awesome. Ryan's helper - a very delightful Mexican woman- was just so wonderful. Food was beyond all the reviews....even better than excellent. The owners were so nice they made us feel like we should eat there every day! Understand opening up 2 other restaurants.... Yea Hash Kitchen. Thank you"}
{"text":"Ugh. The note below is probably why your restaurants are always empty.

You did NOT understand the situation. You asked me no questions about why we were getting frustrated and did not give your hostess a chance to explain the situation to you. You merely interjected when he came up to the counter upset and then you dismissed us with zero apology. What kind of customer service is that? I might have expected that from a shift manager, which is what I thought you were based on your behavior, but never a restaurant owner. 

What my boyfriend said to your hostess was \"she didn't even offer to put our name down.\" Valid complaint. Was his tone the best? Probably not. But we expected basic service which you didn't deliver. You, Mrs. Restaurant owner, are the one to blame for not training your staff well. Your actions were ruder than both my boyfriends and your hostesses actions. Unacceptable. 

We were willing to wait. Like I said, we were excited to come try out your restaurant, but we were not even given the opportunity to wait. Where was the wait time? Neither you nor your hostess gave me that until I had to ask several times. 

The fact that you had two similar instances within the matter of a few days should tell you that there is a problem with your service. Larry probably wanted to wait as well but was not given a chance. Service complaints are so easily rectifiable. Your hostess has had three similar complaints on here in the last two weeks. Train your staff.

Finally, way to go and get your friend, Yvonne, to write a review about your restaurant to counter mine. Very professional. Just like your response. Zero friends, two reviews, the other one for your failed restaurant, Cuttlefish? Nice try.

People - don't waste your time here. You can get a better Bloody Mary cart at The Henry. A better breakfast at Butterfields. And better service anywhere else. This plaza for example: Soi 4, Chez Vous Crepe, POMO, Naya... hell, I will even go to Pei Wei. You're in a spot with a lot of competition, lady. Step it up. 

Again. One star, well deserved."}
{"text":"So delicious!!!! Been here a couple times and everything I've had is really good. The portions are huge so be hungry, service is always really nice. Definitely would recommend one of the Hash's if it's your first time there."}
{"text":"This is probably the most amazing breakfast I've had in the valley.  The food was fabulous, lots of options for savory and sweet.  Blood Mary bar. Coffee in every style including french press. For those of you who like the traditional Benedict on an English muffin, they are happy to accommodate! Ask for Chris at your server. He has super recommendations and a great spirit!"}
{"text":"Edited to add: It was super difficult to decide what to order because everything sounded so good! Can't wait to come back to try something new. 

We recently came to Hash Kitchen for brunch and I'm glad we did. I enjoyed Christina's Tamale Cakes - eggs benny with sweet corn cakes, green chili pork, poached eggs, and green chili hollandaise. Ask for crispy onions on top! The flavors were perfect, but the tamale cakes were very crumbly. I didn't like the \"hash\" potatoes on the side - considering these are the restaurant's namesake, I expected them to be some amazing potatoes, but they were a little flavorless. I wanted to get a pancake instead of the potatoes but they wouldn't let me. Luckily, my boyfriend was generous enough to share some of his crispy + perfect french fries. 

Next time I'd like to try the Bloody Mary bar, but it's pricey at $12/each."}
{"text":"Adrian and our server Katie are the best!! Love Hash Kitchen, by far my favorite breakfast!"}
{"text":"This just became my favorite brunch place in Scottsdale! My kids and I met up with my wife during her staycation at this swanky, hip and trendy brunch place on a Sunday morning. When you first walk in, you were instantly treated to get the best bloody Mary bar in all of Arizona and a DJ spinning music to liven up in your experience. Bonnie not only greets you at the front, but makes you feel like one of the family. She is awesome, so friendly, and checks on you to make sure your meal experience is top notch. I had the herb chicken hash, my wife had the herb chicken and waffles, and the kids had a \"healthy\" stack of buttermilk pancakes to get through. The food was delicious, the portion sizes were well above average and the customer service was extremely good considering a busy Sunday morning. But best of all was the bloody Mary bar!!! Pretty much anything you could desire to be added to a bloody Mary including their own bacon infused vodka and bacon salt on the rim! What?!?! We just loved the atmosphere and will definitely be back again! The only thing keeping from giving 5 stars, just to be fair, was that some of our food came out cold. Probably due to how busy it was, but still. Friendly staff, great music and an excellent food make a great combination. And Bonnie dancing with my 1-yr old daughter to cap off the meal was priceless! See you guys next time."}
{"text":"I had the crab egg benedict that came with seasoned potatoes.  The crab was real, not imitation (big thumbs up), and it was served over biscuits, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce.  I had a few hard shell pieces that made its way into the crab meat, but it wasn't a big deal.  I wasn't a big fan of their hollandaise sauce so I'm glad I had it on the sauce.  Overall, it was good but I found the biscuit to be quite heavy for the pairing.  The poached eggs however were great.  Their breakfast menu is very extensive (I had a hard time deciding between sweet or savory!) and portions are generous.  Their decor is very nice (open, clean, modern) and staff are upbeat and friendly.  The owner comes around and chats with the patrons which I always welcome because it adds a personable touch.  This place seems to be a local favorite.  I hope to get another chance to go again and try their other items."}
{"text":"Not local to AZ. Found this gem of a breakfast spot in minimal distance to the hotel. I cannot recommend it enough! Delicious food! So many different and original breakfast hashes, eggs Benedict, and pancakes. Two words: Bloody Mary bar. There are fun mimosas too! If I'm back in Scottsdale definitely will return! Bonnie and her restaurant staff are so friendly and accommodating. A MUST!"}
{"text":"Turn your head the other way if you want a relaxing and quiet Saturday brunch. If you feel like extending your Friday night girls/boys night out, then this is your place. 

We immediately got a table soon as we walked-in. The vibe was so alive. If you just got out of bed, walking-in to the restaurant would definitely wake you up to the tenth level. They have a DJ on a Saturday brunch. An actual club DJ!!! (I started to look for the dance floor when I walked-in).

The service was really nice. My glass of water was always full. Food was served fast and hot. Our server also gave good recommendations (a sign that he knows the menu). The restaurant was also very clean. Tables were set and cleaned as soon as the customer leaves the table. 

The dishes that we had were just OK. I did not get a chance to try their famous Bloody Mary bar (which looked awesome by the way). I'm not a Bloody Mary fan but I guess it's something I'll consider trying the next time. Back to what we had, the food that we ordered had good points and some room for improvement. I had the Breakfast Lasagna and my wife ordered the Herb Fried Chicken and Waffles. The Herb Fried chicken was a little dry for my taste. A little over-cooked but had some good flavors. The herb wasn't very prominent but you know it's there. The waffles were nice. Soft and tasty on the inside and a bit crunchy on the outside. I would have wanted a little more bacon mixed in to the waffle but it wasn't a deal breaker. I still enjoyed it and the fried leeks on top complimented the dish very well. The breakfast lasagna was a bit of a let down for me. Maybe I would have loved it if it had a little more sausage and a little less potato. The potato and the lasagna pasta just had very little texture and flavor differences that it tasted very one dimensional. The bacon was crunchy but the dish needed more protein. The egg that was placed on top of the dish helped add flavor. The creaminess of the yolk gave some good points but I couldn't get past the potatoes. There was just too much. To be fair, the breakfast lasagna is new to their menu. That's what the server told us. Hopefully, improvements are on its way.

A great place with an OK food selection. I would definitely come back. Maybe I'll try the Bloody Mary bar the next time. Maybe I'll order one of the popular options. Maybe they deserve a 5, but for now just a 3.5 (4 at the most).

{"text":"best breakfast and service, good location and wait until you try the hash and eggs, yum yum!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this restaurant.  After waking up hungry and not wanting to cook, we decided to give Hash Kitchen a try.  When we pulled up, there were quite a few people waiting for a table and it was packed which we thought was a good sign.  We went in to check in and get our name on the waiting list but we noticed there were some seats available at the bar.  Lucky us, we didn't have to wait!  The server at the bar quickly approached us and brought out some water.  The menu was amazing and I ordered the Paella hash and my wife ordered the poached eggs with green Chile pork and sweet corn cakes.  Both dishes were incredible.  The portions were generous and we couldn't finish our plates.  We prefer more food versus less especially when it is absolutely delicious.  If you haven't been here yet, you need to go!  The Bloody Mary bar looked awesome too.  Will be trying that next time too.  Lastly, they had a DJ keeping it lively with good tunes.  Yes, a DJ spinning during breakfast.  The vibe was very cool and alive.  Well done Hash Kitchen!"}
{"text":"I bit on the pricey side, but what do you expect from Scottsdale. Food was excellent in every way."}
{"text":"How have I never been here before! Seriously my new favorite breakfast spot, soooo delicious and its freakin adorable. I had the brisket hash and my daughter had the French toast. Both were the best we have ever had. Check this place out you won't be disappointed. The staff were really friendly and attentive as well."}
{"text":"Great service and the Bloody Mary bar is phenomenal! I also recommend the blueberry mimosa. They encourage alcohol fueled nonsense which is a must for any brunch in my book."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and never leave disappointed. The food is delicious but note the portions are pretty big. Nothing tops the bloody mary bar!! Different vodkas, mixes and plenty of garnish options. Plus, the live entertainment is awesome."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! First off, the Bloody Mary bar is amazing and has everything you can possibly want to garnish your drink! They also have house-infused vodkas...cilantro lime is awesome! We ordered the banana split brioche French toast and the tamale cakes Benedict. Both were amazing but if you only order one thing here get the French toast....the caramelized bananas in the middle...I mean come on. So good"}
{"text":"I was driving around with my wife and son after the first couple of spots we wanted to go to for breakfast were long long waits.  Then my wife remembered she had read about The Hash Kitchen.  We went to check it out.  The menu is out on the patio to review before choosing to go in and eat.  It certainly looked good.

When we got in and seated, we were greeted by nothing but warm and friendly people.  It was busy but not obnoxious busy.  However we didn't have to wait long to order, although with as many really good looking choices on the menu, we took some time to decide but we were checked up on every couple of minutes.  

I ended up having the Herb Chicken and Waffle.  Wow!  I've had something similar at a place some of you may know, Hash House A-Go-Go.  This beats that place in my opinion.  It was very tasty.  

My wife had the Short Rib Benedict.  I had a bite.  Another wow.  I also had a side of their bacon.  Some of the best bacon I've ever had!!

Between the service and the food, we will definitely be back.  I'm impressed.  Now I'm glad we got shut out of the other places.  I always say things happen for a reason.  I was meant to try this place and so are you.  You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Loud & hot, loud from bad acoustics & dj music, felt like it was 85 degrees in there, the best way to communicate is by test, never going back"}
{"text":"Our Mothers Day brunch was a disaster. We got there a few minutes before our reservation time of 1 o'clock to find out that they were running 45 minutes to an hour late on their reservations. We finally got seated at 2:15. An hour after taking our orders they came back to say that they had run out of some things. Then they brought out several wrong orders. We had to send back more than half of our food. The biscuits on my salmon beni were raw inside. The salmon was dry. The doughnuts were hard on the outside and still raw doughy on the inside. We left at 4 and went out to our favorite sushi restaurant instead. This truly was the worse Mothers Day meal ever."}
{"text":"The Bloody Mary bar is the reason you go here. If you want better food, go to Snooze. If you want better management, go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Very fun environment. Had a fun time here!! I personally didn't like my dish too much but everyone else with me (6 others) loved their plates :) overall a great experience"}
{"text":"We go here often and love it! Great food, mimosa options, and Bloody Mary bar. Love this place and highly recommend! Our food is always consistently delicious!"}
{"text":"Loud but fun if that's your scene. The pico de gallo is out of the world... I would stick breakfast burrito,hash or Benedict. Bloody Mary bar is solid!"}
{"text":"I had a great brunch experience here! The wait was short even for a busy Saturday. Our server Evan was funny and very attentive. Never had to ask for my water glass to be filled, Evan was on it! Would definitely recommend the create your own Bloody Mary bar!"}
{"text":"Omg hands down best service, everytime go in and ask for Chris the best most handsome waiter . he's on it. we come.here for him and the amazing food and atmosphere . Chris is the most personable attaintive go getter. love hash thanks chris for introducing it us"}
{"text":"A great place to start the day! Became even better because boy (whats up with the B's?) were they friendly and courteous! 

First time at Hash Kitchen and certain to be a long relationship. First impressions create the tone of image and mood. Miss Aimee our hostess, definitely made a positive one. Miss Aimee greets everyone as \"friends\" and although it was our genesis( it was Sunday, had to inject somewhere) her warmth was most welcoming. 
The restaurant is large providing a bar area ;) and several seating areas including an outside sojourn. The day was pleasant and we elected to sit outdoors. 

Our waiter Evan could not have been nicer and patient. Explaining the menu (there's lots to choose from) and making recommendations. We began with a bottle of Chandon bubbly. Excited to try a few different dishes, ordered the Herb Chicken and Waffles, Real Men eat Quiche, and Carnitas Hash. Having no \"Real Men\" around, I auditioned and got the part after 8 tries. Every Dish was different and worthy of praise; tasting delightfully delicious! Pictures truly tell a story, and I'm hoping to have captured their tasty essence. Please see Pic's.

Combining our experience from beginning to end, makes this a reoccurring must.
Plenty of parking without any problem!"}
{"text":"We love The Hash Kitchen, we were so excited when they opened this new location closer to us!  It's just as wonderful as the original location. We were so happy to be greeted by Bonnie at this location as well, she always goes above & beyond. Great food, great service, & great coffee!"}
{"text":"Make sure you come here hungry - or HANGRY!  The food portions here are ginormous!!!!!   Holy breakfast sandwich was as big as my face!  Amazing!!  Super cute place in a strip mall.  And bonus points because the owner apparently drives the Back to the Future Delorean that is parked outside.  I mean, literally, the exact same car!!!!!  Super cool.  In any event, the food here was good.  We also had the monkey bread and I'm not much of a sweet tooth for breakfast but boy that was good stuff.  Someone else got the Chilaquiles.  WOW!    Everything was awesome.  And they offer this nice refreshing fruit infused water outside... free.  So good.  We were tired and on our way to drive back to Los Angeles so we didn't hit up the Bloody Mary Bar but that looked amazing too.  We saw a couple of people getting those next to us and I definitely would recommend that.   It looked so good!"}
{"text":"Amy and Jenn were fantastic. Mimosa flight on point! Had the Thai chicken salad, deliciousness! Trust me I'm a fatso!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I are from Gilbert staying in Scottsdale for a staycation. We yelped this place and decided to try it out. So delicious. Food was amazing, with a great big portion. We would recommend the breakfast burrito hands down. The service was remarkable. The dj was an added plus. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for a brunch bday party!!!  They accommodated our party of 15.  Love the service and attention we got from the staff.  Never had to ask for a refill.  Since a few of us were early, the special menu caught my eye....Bacon donuts???  Say it isn't so!  I had to order it.  It is freshly made, a little chewy/soft (but I like), and very f*cking awesome.  OUCH I need to work out an extra day to burn this off!!!  And of course, got the herb chicken and waffles since I blew the diet plan anyways.  The waffles was good, but I did not taste the vanilla.  The chicken was ok, I did not taste enough flavors.  It was covered by the fried onions on top.  

Overall, it was a great time, great service, and good food!"}
{"text":"My favorite brunch place in the valley! The food and service is always on point. Best Bloody Marys in town"}
{"text":"Tried this last weekend, a great addition to the neighborhood choices of breakfast places.  I had a build-your-own scramble w/veggies that was very good, potatoes served with it had a good flavor.  Hubby's chilaquilies were ok, nothing spectacular. The service at the bar was great, they kept making sure we had everything we needed and were friendly and personable. We look forward to riding our bikes here next time, their outdoor patio is conducive to hosting a good amount of people and room for bikes, too! :)"}
{"text":"By far best new brunch place in Scottsdale. Reminds me of Vegas brunching. Food, service and atmosphere is over the top amazing. Also, BONNIE made out experience extra special. She is one of a kind"}
{"text":"Have been meaning to try and stopped in with wife. We were sat quickly it was not very busy. 
After at least 7 or 8 minutes we wondered if we would ever see a server. Finally, a server walked by and asked if we had been helped, we said no and he said he would take care of us even though it wasn't his section.
I asked if the corned beef hash was made on the premise and he informed it was not. OK that was very weird to me as it is \"HASH\" Kitchen. Decided to go with the Italian hash as that was made on premise.
Wife ordered the  Huevos Ranchero Hash.
OK first I will say that the dishes we got were both good. Very tasty and hot. They came out lightning fast. My eggs (over easy) were perfect BUT both were not hash as far as what I perceive to be hash. My dish was a layer of fried potatoes with some onions and bell peppers, the 2 eggs placed on top and a  nice Italian sausage on the side of the plate. So again, the food was very good but not hash. Wife's dish was also good but not really a hash. My Italian hash (2 eggs, potatoes and 1 good sized sausage and a small buttermilk biscuit was $15.00. Your call on the value.
So will we go back? Probably. Will we order hash? Probably not.
The service here really needs to be improved too. The server we had (not his section remember?) was busy with a large party and a few other tables. We sat for long time with empty plates as one service staff after another walked by, glanced at us (and our empty plates) and kept on walking (I assure you all we both showered that morning lol).
BTW: The Bloody Mary \"buffet\" look really good. But as we both had to work not this visit."}
{"text":"Taylor was awesome! Amazing food, the Mimosas flight was delicious, and the atmosphere was top notch. Very friendly staff!! Great service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Bee was our waitress, and she was sweet and on top of things. The hostess was lovely as well. This was our second visit in one week and everything was fantastic, although the salads were a little overdressed. We took my father-in-law for his birthday since this is his new favorite neighborhood place, and he loved everything including the delicious and still warm donut that Bee brought out for him. We also had fun with the Bloody Mary bar, although some of the items were over the top spicy! Our first visit was on a Sunday when they had a DJ, which was a little much. I prefer the quieter weekday lunch."}
{"text":"This pace is so delicious & the service is amazing. The cereal cocktails are a must & they have a huge make your own bloody mary bar. Bonnie who runs the front is amaaaazing, so cute & hilarious. The best brunch place I've ever been to."}
{"text":"I love the build your own Bloody Mary's but the food is very basic and not worth returning."}
{"text":"Great place to take out of town visitors for a different kind of brunch. Great service by our waiter Nathan who was super patient with all the change orders our kids had. Definitely try the mimosas and Bloody Mary!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast menu in town by far. We tend to avoid the weekends, as it's so busy. 
Portions are huge!   Love the French Press coffee table side."}
{"text":"\"Sometimes you want to go
Where everybody knows your name,
And they're always glad you came.\"

As I was shown to my table, I found myself humming the theme song to \"Cheers,\" a wonderful show about a unique bar in Boston.

The Hash Kitchen on Frank Lloyd Wright has a similar vibe.  It's busy, it's full of smiling patrons, and you are warmly welcomed by a striking blonde named Bonnie who makes you feel that you are the most important customer in the establishment.

Would the food live up to the high expectations set by Bonnie and the amazing Bloody Mary bar I'd been eyeing?  Absolutely!

The menu is innovative and you find yourself thinking that this time I will try the chorizo omelet, and next time I will try the lasagne.

Our 4 year old had decided to dress as the princess she is, and she proclaimed her waffles to be the world's very best.

Those of us who ordered the lasagne were deliriously satiated.

And those of us who found ourselves biting into the chorizo omelet were thrilled with the fluffy scrambled eggs and the scrumptious veggies and cubed potatoes.

The flight of Mimosas was impressive and the customizable Bloody Mary was spicy, sultry, and was the perfect accompaniment to our chic breakfasts.

Bonnie interacted with us several times and was just a delight.  What an asset to the Hash Kitchen operation.

Our server was out of this world!  Attentive, helpful in guiding us, ever ready to make certain our glasses were filled.

This was our first time and we have to say we'll be heading back...we love the food and atmosphere.  And we soon hope to be considered regulars, where everyone will know our name!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I loved the atmosphere. The food was great and the staff was very welcoming. The Bloody Mary bar was amazing and there are so many different options to choose from. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is so tasty! Definitely my new favorite breakfast restaurant. If you don't like crowds I'd avoid coming on the weekends but the food is totally worth it. Jose is awesome and managed to give us great service even when the restaurant was packed!"}
{"text":"This place has a fantastic brunch and the BEST bloody marry bar.

Starting with the music on Sat/Sun they have a live DJ spinning some great beats in the background making the mood uplifting and friendly.

Hostess were nice, seated us fast.

Service was great, our waiter was cheerful, fast and gave great service.

This place has a great selection of modern, breakfast/lunch items. I can't wait to go back and try more of what they have!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great food, and our waiter Gino was the best :) thank you for an excellent experience!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food and can you go wrong with mimosa flights and live music!?  Amazing spot!"}
{"text":"Interesting place a little too trendy for us had a DJ playing dance tunes at11? A bloody Mary bar and local sourced food.pricey but it is probably par for Scottsdale Arizona."}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea.  We went there on a Sunday when it was packed and we were lucky enough to snag a couple of seats at the bar instead of waiting 15 min. for a table.  The DJ was right behind us and the place was NOISY!  Ok, if you're looking for lively, then it might be your cup of tea.  We ordered a bloody mary and the BM bar had tons of options for add-in's but the basic drink was meh.  

Service was good and the food was prompt.  It was average fare which probably suits most.  Actually the biscuit with a salty top was maybe my favorite item on the plate.  Certainly large enough portions to fuel most people.  Suffice it to say, as long as you are looking for what they have to offer, you might like it more than me, but I'm off to search for more ambiance, less noise and a little better taste."}
{"text":"Unfortunately a very poor execution on all fronts. We got the cannoli donuts and the corn beef hash Benedict. 

The donuts were overcooked and were more like biscuits with the smallest amount of poorly made cannoli filling on top. 
The corn beef hash Benedict was terrible. The corn beef was an out-of-the can (think Hormel) lump that was reminiscent of dog food. The hollandaise sauce and eggs were somehow devoid of taste. Finally, the potato pancake base was ok but could have been mistaken for a McDonalds 'hashborwn'.

Service was slow and barely came by the table (even though there was really anyone else around - definitely not peak time). Only positive thing was the server's attitude and helpfulness removing the cost of the donuts when we have honest feedback."}
{"text":"Am I missing something?
I love breakfast food, and I don't think I have really high standards - I just felt this place was mediocre. Maybe we ordered wrong?
Service was fine, nothing spectacular. Had the coffee, which was good. Tried two different frittatas, both were just mediocre, definitely needed more salt or something because they were just bland, and didn't have a ton of veggies/cheese. The potato hash was SO greasy! It is kind of sad if the biscuit is the best part of your breakfast ...
Like I said, just an overall mediocre experience, overpriced, and mediocre service. Maybe people in this area don't mind overpaying, but I think there is much better breakfast food around and better deals to be found!"}
{"text":"I had the Lump Crab Hash- the sweet potatoes and caramelized onions were great a combo.  The hostess is darling and so friendly- and a great wait staff. 
My date had the breakfast burrito- which was huge topped with a beautiful avocado."}
{"text":"The cannoli pancakes were to die for! So delicious! Portions were huge so plenty of leftovers. Great coffee and wonderful service too."}
{"text":"The best brunch place I've been to! The menu has a great variety and everything we tried was delicious. Staff is friendly and our waiter was pretty funny. To top it all off, the prices are very reasonable especially for the quality! We will definitely be coming back here whenever we're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Today I had the Nutella and banana french toast. ...awesome. Great flavor! My wife had the crab benny again, it  is soooo friggin good! No pics today, we attacked our food so fast! Lol.

I keep forgetting to mention, the kids meals are really big and tasty and only five bucks! Choc chip pancakes, scrambled eggs, grill cheese panini, fresh homemade chicken tenders, etc.. The kids love the food and we love the fact that the kids meals are thoughtfully prepared. Most place don't take the time or effort to make good kid's meals!

See my original review below!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place! The service was great and there was virtually no wait time even on a Sunday at 10:30. The Bloody Mary bar was top notch and so much fun. (Some advice for newbies: don't choose every single topping like I did! Self control is key here! I was full before my food even came! Oops.) 

I also ordered the French toast with coconut and almond! It was really good! The only thing I wish is that they didn't already put syrup on it. The description said it came on the side and it was a little soggy with all the syrup. They should let the customer put that on. I will definitely be back to this place many more times!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here for my birthday and the good was amazing! So many unique breakfast dishes to choose from. It was very busy but we were never neglected! I want to go back and try everything!! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Love Hash Kitchen! Bonnie makes you feel warm and welcomed! You have to wait for a table on the weekends but it's worth it."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place is awesome, the bottomless mimosas deal for $9 was a killer Wednesday surprise! They also had an option for a mimosa flight consisting of various flavors for $16 or so! The bartender (guy with a beard; forgot his name sorry!) was super awesome with service and on top of the game showing me all the flavors and making sure I received my refills! Food options were great, everything sounded good! There were many sweet and savory options. We ended up ordering savory this time choosing the Italian sausage frittata which was something I've never tried before! The flavors were good, the food was fresh, although I could not have eaten it without the hot sauce, meaning it was a little lacking flavor! My friend ordered the \"Boring Benedict\" she said it tasted like your traditional Benedict and it was exactly what she was looking for! I have heard great things about this place and I will most definitely return for the dj setting on the weekends!"}
{"text":"The environment, the food, the drinks & our server Gino made our first visit exceptionally pleasant. I ordered Cristina's Tamale Cakes & it was delicious!! We will most definitely return & try the other items on the menu. Btw: the Hash Kitchen Bloody Mary won't disappoint ."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I come here all the time just for Bonnie. She makes Hash Kitchen what it is. It wouldn't be the same without her."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is amazing, the DJ adds a little club atmosphere while the food and decor add a essence of elegance. The customer service was so fast and friendly. 
The food is impeccable. The presentation is astounding and the favors are devine. I will return to have breakfast here and recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Came on a Tues at 11 for brunch. Service was very slow. Waiter never stopped by to refill my coffee. Had crab Benedict and chicken and waffles which were just ok. For the price and the service you receive, you're better off going to Butterfields down the street. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The service was incredible, it was an extraordinary wait but well worth it. Good food good service. The blueberry mimosa was so delightful. The bloody mary bar is a brand new experience for me, loved it slim Jim's, pickled pineapple, pickled mango.  I loved that Bonnie was everywhere cleaning up and looking great. Her hospitality was top notch! I can appreciate an owner/ upper management getting dirty ensuring that patron mess is taken care of. It makes everything flow so much better."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! We enjoyed the all enjoyed Bloody Mary's and Mimosas (Pineapple and Grapefruit) and the below...

Boring Beni- Amazing
Chicken & Waffle - Amazing 
Chicken Beni- Amazing 
Salmon Beni - Awesome but would probably do the Chicken Beni versus Salmon 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Just had Mother's Day brunch there. Food was good, server was good but our Bloody Mary order took 15 minutes to appear and one our meals came out about 10 minutes after everyone else's.  They were busy but, so what.  We barely finished our meal and the Manager made no bones about wanting us to leave so the next party could take our place.  Extremely unprofessional and rude.  Now instead of leaving with a good impression and food experience, we're discussing how long it will be before we return."}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've eaten at in PHX. From it's open, bright setting to the amazing Bloody Mary Bar to the incredible array of hash and eggs Benedict dishes this is not your typical breakfast/brunch restaurant. Staff is perfection, too. This is a must try!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING breakfast place. I already want to come back. First off - the bloody mary bar is so neat! It's not cheap but well worth it. They have so many different options for you to choose from: alcohol, salt, mix, tons of additions. It was so fun to make them! The food was great too! I recommend the French toast, so yummy. They had music playing and the staff was fun and lively. We will be back soon for sure and looking forward to the new location closer to home!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! The atmosphere is great on the weekends. They have a DJ that spins the newest hits, but nothing to crazy. My parents, 68 and 70, thought it was a fun place! That's saying something!!! Food was exceptional, service was OK. I'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Fun environment with a DJ on Saturday morning but the food was just okay. Breakfast burrito sounded great but was very bland. The Bloody Mary bar was good but no cheese toppings! Need cheese!"}
{"text":"Just left Hash Kitchen.  While the hostess and waitress were very nice, our food was mediocre.
Not much taste, and the \"lump crab\" is canned. 
The cold brew coffee is not authentic.  We will not return."}
{"text":"The food was just okay, but not worth the price and the service wasn't great either. When we were seated we had to wait almost 10 minutes just to get water. We tried to order the mimosa flight with 4 different flavors, which the menu lists 6 flavors to choose from; however, we were told on the weekends that it's a set choosing of only 3 flavors. The flavors change on the weekends and one of the flavors that was included on this particular Saturday wasn't even listed on the menu. I suppose if you like mimosas and options, go here during the week. We ended up changing the drink order because of the lack of options to the prosecco smash, but didn't get our drink until we were more than half way done with our food. (despite having inquired with the server a couple times) When our food was delivered we were never asked if we needed any condiments, etc. since there weren't any on the table and the food was fairly bland. We tried to track down the server, who was friendly, but nowhere to be found, to ask for hot sauce and some butter for the biscuits. We finally got him after 5 minutes , but then had to wait another 5 just for him to bring the condiments. You're probably wondering why I rated this place a three star after all this, but the people watching and entertainment that happens here is probably the best and helps you to look past the quality of food and service.  If you just want an entertaining breakfast, go here, but if you're looking for really great food and service, I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"We live in San Diego and go out to eat 5 days/week. Our daughter is a physician in Phx so we all came out here to visit her and she insisted we come here for brunch. Top notch food, amazing service and personable staff! We ordered French toast, Americano scramble, corn beef hash, fried chicken hash, cocoa puff drinks and other delish drinks. Bonnie's effervescent personality is such a great entertainment, as she is so sweet and bubbly. She is human champagne!! Katie behind the bar was a doll and so helpful and Chad was a pleasure to speak with about our experience there. Will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really good place to bike to for a Sunday morning breakfast.  Great staff , wonderful food. I had the americano scramble and my guy had the machaca hash . Wow that beef was amazing.  We will be back"}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better bloody mary bar. The two woman that helped us were very nice and were  having a great time,"}
{"text":"Great service & food! They were so accommodating to our large group. I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"In town for work and found this place on Yelp, the DIY bloody Mary bar sold me. Sure enough the bloodies were amazing, service was great and the food was GREAT. actually came back the next morning to grab some more of the food before I headed out of town. Great place."}
{"text":"We had a party of 14 and Chris, our server, did a fantastic job. Everyone at the table commented about his cute dimples."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice to eat and I have officially decided I will not be returning. Aside from the super friendly manager this place does not have anything else going for it as far as I'm concerned. The first time I went I ordered a scramble sans mushrooms; it came with mushrooms anyway which made it taste awful. Today I went in for a bloody Mary which was the most horrible tasting bloody Mary mix I ever had. I had the French toast which took forever & was extremely soggy. I sat at the bar and the bartender although very nice was so busy she barely turned around to see if I needed anything. There were two employees sitting at the bar next to me talking all about work logistics, business, servers etc which I thought was very inappropriate and unprofessional of them."}
{"text":"Their bloody Mary bar is incredible. Reasonably priced too. They have every brunch dish you can think of. I had the crab Benedict and it was really good. The service was great. I would definitely come back for brunch. They have a large bar and a special for bottomless mimosas."}
{"text":"I believe in giving second chances especially if the other party makes every effort to win you back as a customer. In this case, Hash Kitchen made every effort to make me a fan and they succeeded. 

I was invited back by the owner and I brought along my hubby and in laws. I ordered the cannoli donuts and lump crab hash. Hubby ordered the huevos ranchero hash. My mother in law took advantage of the build your own Bloody Mary and she loved it!! Father in law ordered the American scrambler. The result? We chowed down and enjoyed every bite! The in laws were raving about the taste of the food and the concept. It was by far a different experience than my first. 

At the end of our meal, the owner gave us complimentary cannoli donuts even though I already ordered some. It didn't matter because my family slurped it up like it was soup. The only negative thing I can say is that when we placed our order, it took awhile to get our food (20+ minutes), but after we were done eating - my mother in law said, \"the food was worth the wait!\" 

They all give Hash Kitchen five stars and so I will too!"}
{"text":"This place has always been good. It's a favorite for our out of state family to go here when they are visiting us in Phoenix. The herb chicken hash or chicken and waffles are a must. Bloody Mary bar is also only $5 during the week! Only negative is waiting time on the weekend as this place gets packed early."}
{"text":"Food and service were great. We had breakfast and i thought everything tasted very good."}
{"text":"Wanted to come here because of the pictures I've seen with their bloody mary's. The bloody mary bar was cool, had a lot of options, but at the end of the day, it was a bloody mary. Their mimosas are pretty good however. The food here was average and I expected better. Tried their huevos hash which was blah and I didn't finish it as well as their lump crab benedict. The crab was excellent, but the portion was tiny. The rest of the benedict was very dry because they use dry biscuits for the base of the benedict. Their pancakes were just average, IHop is better honestly for pancakes. The second time I came here during the middle of brunch it turned into a club and they were blaring Spice Girls and other jams, which hey I love the Spice Girls, but you could barely have a conversation because it was so loud."}
{"text":"What's the saying under promise and over deliver. They missed that at Hash Kitchen. They over price their food and drinks and serious under deliver. My hubby and I have tried several times to give it a shot and every time we eat there we walkout wondering how we spent that much money and are so disappointed. We have tried the one on FLW and the one on Scottsdale same disappointment. The staff and food are pretty, unfortunately the service is slow and the food is bland."}
{"text":"I decided to head in for brunch with a group of my friends and it was great! The mimosa flight was what intrigued to me to go and we got the orange, guava, mango, and raspberry. The orange and mango were my favorite! There were so good and great to share! 

It got even better with the food! I ordered the breakfast sandwich with Texas toast and woah was it packed with flavor! 

Tyler was our server and he was awesome! If you're ever looking for a great place to have breakfast and drinks this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Place is awesome! Atmosphere is perfect! Had DJ and music going! Nicest staff, very friendly! Nice Bloody Mary bar, options for mimosa and craft 'breakfast drinks'. hash was awesome and very filling. Would have been a 5 but husband said could have been a 'little bigger portion' ( even tho he didn't finish!)"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast after hiking Tom's Thumb. Great atmosphere and amazing food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Make sure to have a bloody mary and hang out with Bonnie!"}
{"text":"Came here for my bachelorette brunch last Friday and it was really fun! The only complaints I have are that it's quite pricey and the Bloody Mary bar is basically a one-time refill kinda deal. They warn you about this when you go up there so it's not a surprise in that sense, but I've been to other build-your-own Bloody Mary bars that let you refill your drink with toppings as often as you like so this stood out to me.

As for my own order, I had the sweet potato-lump crab hash. It was very flavorful and light, so I didn't feel too full after I finished it. I also had the mimosa flight, which was delicious! I loved the guava the most and really liked how they put a slice of strawberry on the rim of the glass of strawberry mimosa, same thing for orange. 

The service was fast, efficient, and our waiter was friendly. They take reservations which is a plus since our group was quite big (8). Overall, it's a fun place for a nice brunch (:"}
{"text":"Sunday Funday amazing breakfast with my bestie! Tried the Benedict fries to start for the first time, and found our new favorite! It's a must! And some cannoli pancakes! Left feeling like we will be back next weekend for more!!!!"}
{"text":"This place seems overrated. We typically do brunch at places that take reservations so we don't have to wait, but decided to give it a shot since there's so many amazing reviews and the menu looked delicious. We waited 45 minutes - super busy on a Sunday morning - good sign, right? Ordered the breakfast lasagna which is highlighted on the menu as a specialty. When it came out (which took a while, the server even mentioned the food was probably taking a minute because the lasagna needs a while to cook), noodles were still semi hard - not al dente just not cooked - and it was barely even warm. Our server (she was super nice, no complaints there) asked if I wanted to try something else and I ordered the fried chicken salad sandwich. While I waited for my food I my husband and I split was waffle which was good, but his corned beef hash was rough - the potatoes looked like they were microwaved - not a single bit of crispy. Our friend's side potatoes were the same. Pretty disappointing for a place pretty much named after crispy potatoes lol. Everyone I was with had finished their food and I was still waiting for mine. My sandwich came out overloaded with sprouts and lacking mayo or any sort of sauce so it was dry. Also pretty flavorless which was also disappointing since it was fried chicken. My fries, undercooked like everyone else's potatoes. The manager apologized for the wait for my meal replacement and said he was taking care of it - which was nice that it was acknowledged but I had already waited that long I wouldn't have known the difference if they'd just taken the time to make my food properly. I feel like they may have too many items on their menu for their own good - they're too busy. Not sure if we'll try it again mostly because it felt like a waste of time. I did appreciate how the staff handled things but I know they can't necessarily control the quality of the food that comes out."}
{"text":"What a place! The bloodys were ahhmazing.  I've never seen a bloody bar like this place (and we've done bloody bars before!).  The bottomless memosas were great too!

That said - the food was great but lacking in distinction and mostly under-delivered on the menu descriptions.  Don't get me wrong though - the food was really good hence still four stars.

We all agreed these folks delivered an excellent experience.

Some of what we ordered - smoked salmon Benedict, fried chicken Benedict, donut appetizer, cereal Popsicles (for our kiddo - loved em), steak and eggs, and a few other entrees among six of us..."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles are great, real maple syrup.  A side of gravy for the chicken eould be nice.
Pass on the corned beef hash, too many green peppers,  corned beef tasted like from a can mixed with the potatoes. Biscuits were good."}
{"text":"Love coming here for brunch. You can't beat the build your own Bloody Mary bar and the eggs benny are perfection!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the thk hash herb chicken and lump crab. The herb chicken was my fav.! The had leek strip that was lightly battered and glazed with honey. Delicious. The lump crab was good but I felt like it was missing something.  Maybe a gravy of some sort? The server recommend the hollandaise with it. We also tried their original bloody mary. It was VERY spicy so we asked them to dilute it with a little more tomato juice but otherwise good. The best part of this experience was the customer service. At first we thought the wait was going to be long. The lady in the front was telling the group ahead of us 30mins to an hr and we were going to leave. But she cleared a high top for us so we could be seated immediately. The server and manager was equally nice, stopping over to make small talk and joke with us. I love how every person there is working; management and all. That's how a restaurant is suppose to operate.  Not just management pointing fingers for other people to do work. They were busy and they all help clear tables and bus. Keep up the great work guys! =)"}
{"text":"Researched brunch places prior to going to Arizona. The pictures on Yelp sold me!

Went in on a Monday around noon. I already knew I wanted the lump crab sweet potato hash but the menu is definitely worth browsing through. The lump crab sweet potato hash exceeded my expectation (my expectations were pretty high) and I was able to split my dish in half and save the leftovers for a second meal. I had 3 cups of their French pressed coffee and a cup to go. Boy was I wired! But it was too delicious to stop drinking.

Great experience with this place, highly recommend dining here. Hey, you might even run into Charles Barkley since he likes to frequent this place. If it's good enough for Chuck, it's good enough for me!"}
{"text":"This place is so adorably cool! What's not to like? First of all, You're greeted like they've known you forever and the atmosphere is relaxing and hip. Dj spinning on Saturday to wake you up and get you groovin' and a superb Bloody Mary bar with all the Fixins' ... But wait! There's more they also serve bottomless mimosas in many different Flavors made with fresh fruits and if you're not in the drinking mood you can order up a carafe of French pressed coffee ( they serve Lavazza ) 
Linda, the manager, is a doll and is known as \" mama Linda \" loved meeting her. 
I give Hash Kitchen a perfect 5 stars for being the best next day remedy to a night out in DTScottsdale. Sunglasses on!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for breakfast or lunch.   The service is always great and the staff is very friendly.  We love going here on weekends and really enjoy the DJ."}
{"text":"Maybe I caught them on an off day, but I found this place to be just ok. The service was great, people were very friendly and food came out quickly. Where I was disappointed was the food, I ordered the lump crab and sweet potato hash, which was a popular item. I love a good hash and the best part is crispy potatoes with soft potato inside. This hash had shredded potatoes with absolutely no crisp
On them. The crab I will say was quite tasty and the eggs were all poached. The biscuit it came with was pretty underwhelming as well. I didn't care for
The grains of sugar on top and there was no flakiness too it or soft inside. Just kind of a dry rock of a bread item. I don't normally eat bread so when I do I expect it to be worth it. So overall it was a descent meal idea and ingredient wise, but I think the execution was lacking the refinements that take it from mediocre to delicious."}
{"text":"We went for a late breakfast on Friday and the service and food were fantastic. Bonnie and Evan were so helpful and the fried chicken Benedict was delicious. A new favorite breakfast place for us."}
{"text":"So I made the mistake of coming to this location thinking they, like the Scottsdale Rd location, had bottomless mimosas. My fault. However, when asking a waiter if they did serve bottomless mimosas, I got a very sassy response. That is not quality service, no matter how busy y'all are. Also, this place is very trendy with a live DJ spinning bangers for Sunday brunch. My question is why are the hostesses elderly women? They had a very hard time hearing me and weren't familiar with the menu at all.

Regardless, I base my reviews on food and flavor. Mimosa flights were A+! I enjoyed the variety of flavors though the pineapple mimosa retained some of the can flavor. I avoided the blood mary bar because I watched some brunch goers sticking their fingers into the jars. For shame.

While we waited to be seated, we snacked on some fried raviolis at the bar. For brunch, we got the carnitas hash, lemon ricotta pancake, and one of the eggs benedict that are no longer offered as I look at the current menu. Everything tasted fine. For the price, I would expect something to stellar or to stand out.

Come for the drinks and cute decorations."}
{"text":"We only stop by here if we are really hungry after the gym that's close by. There's usually only a 10-15min wait on a Sat but there's no reason to make it uncomfortable to eat your breakfast. If your table has a white drape over it, it's one of the cheap folding ones that they bought so they can seat more people. The legs of the chair stops you from pushing in your chair and if you're wearing a dress, you'll have to sit with your legs to the side. I couldn't back up my chair either since I was already backed up into the wall. Other people at my table was backed up to the people next to us. Food is good but service (slow) and accommodation really lacks here. Everyone that sits on the outside was getting hit by other customers and workers as they walk by."}
{"text":"The Hash Kitchen is a fun, modern environment, with great food, drinks, and servers. We had Chris as our server and he was energetic and paid attention to detail. Our glasses were always filled and our food came out in a timely manner. I would recommend this breakfast joint to everyone. The bar is a nice added treat as well. Thanks for the food!"}
{"text":"Great food. Fun time. Would recommend. But watch out for some shenanigans on the suggested tip amount!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent for breakfast. I had the brisket corn bread hash; the brisket was apparently smoked for 12 hours, and it showed. The corn bread was sweet and the potatoes were savory. It was the best thing I've eaten in a long time. The coffee is very good. My wife had the lemon ricotta pancakes, which were sweet and light. 

I'd wholeheartedly recommend this place. They have two small outdoor patios that look like a nice place to eat breakfast. The atmosphere inside was a little formal for breakfast and the music was strange (greatest hits of the 90s for some weird reason). But the staff made up for it with excellent service and the food was spectacular. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've worked literally right across the street from this place for a good 2 years and I can't believe I've never bothered to stop by here sooner! The ambiance is so nice and soothing and when you're inside, there's so much open space! Our server always checked up on us to make sure we were provided everything we requested. I ordered the huevos rancheros hash, and I did not expect it to be so huge! It filled me up quickly that I had to take the other half of my meal Togo. The one thing that stood out with my meal that I considered unique from your typical rancheros huevos were what tasted like crispy fried onions on top! Definitely my favorite part of my meal."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. Can go straight from gym, alone and always feel welcome at the bar alone or dressed up with friends for a more formal affair. DJ always keeping the place jumping. The Bloody Mary bar is ridiculous...almost a tour attraction on its own lol meatballs, cheese sticks...CRAZY. I'm a fan of the breakfast burrito or the chorizo scramble. Honestly can't go wrong with anything you order."}
{"text":"Great service awsome food. The atmosphere was very warm and welcoming.  The Bloody Mary bar was unbelievable kudos to the staff and our waiter it was an unbelievable experience we had a group of 20 for are annual retreat and they went over and beyond to make us comfortable very accommodating for are party. Thank you for such a great experience."}
{"text":"Sitting here at the bar waiting for my to go order. They got me a cup of coffee while I waited. Every staff member was so nice I felt like they were my friends! This bar is spotless and clean id eat right off of it! The bar is so fun and open with indoor and outdoor seating and big TV's. Feels like a Vegas resort! Perfect place to come post up and cheer on your fantasy football team. I am mad my family didn't get up and we took our food to go but I want to come back next week! The build your own bloody bar is awesome-- over 40 toppings. You can custom your mix to your liking. I got chicken and waffles and lemon ricotta pancakes and a kids meal so I'll update once we actually try the food but I'm so excited this place is literally across the street from us! Definitely s new go to!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Hash Kitchen around 11am for brunch on a Saturday, without a reservation, and were seated right away! The place was huge but still packed. There was also a DJ! I've never been to a brunch place with a DJ. It made the place really lively! We ordered the Lemon & Ricotta pancake and the Carnitas Hash. Both portions were HUGE and good for the price. Definitely could have split each entree into two meals, unless you're super hungry! I also got a Latte - presentation was nice but I wouldn't say it was one of the best I've had. If I lived in Phoenix, I would definitely go back because it's such a great value for the food! I think they're looking to expand, so who knows, it may end up in the city I'm in! For a place this large, their service was amazing - they made sure to constantly check in with us and even opened the door for us on our way out!"}
{"text":"Brought our friends here from Michigan for the first time. The waitstaff were amazing. The host staff were amazing. The bloody Mary bar was amazing. The food was off the charts awesome. Love the DJ and the music. Always excited to come to the hash kitchen."}
{"text":"I was visiting Easter weekend and this looked like a fun place to stop for brunch. There was a wait for a table, but there were seats available at the bar so we chose to sit there. The mimosa flight looked fun, but in reality they do not taste great. Since it was a holiday weekend, they were only offering a select holiday menu. I was pretty disappointed by the choices, as when I liked the regular menu I had seen online better than what they were offering that day. Service was extremely slow even though we were seated at the bar. I think I ended up ordering a scrambler, but I wasn't a fan of it. It lacked flavor. Overall, this was a big disappointment and I wish we had gone elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot. Bloody Mary bar is absolutely crazy good. Great crowd and fun atmosphere. Food was fantastic and they handled a party of 20 without blinking. Bonnie is a doll!"}
{"text":"I love a good breakfast/brunch spot and Hash Kitchen check off all the requirements for a staple spot! I love the food and the servings are huge! You know the food is good when it tastes better or just as good the next day/reheated! No really, it does! I always get the almond/coconut encrusted French toast and because there is no way I can eat it all in one sitting, I always have leftovers and look forward to enjoying it the next day.  Whenever I have visitors, I am sure to take them to Hash Kitchen and everyone has always left full and satisfied! Oh, an extra bonus, is the very friendly manager/owner who is super sweet!  I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My sister and I are here on vacation and we went to hogs and hops last night for dinner. Linda, the general manager, recommended we come to The Hash Kitchen for breakfast this morning. (These two restaurants have the same owners). After she described their chicken and waffles and Bloody Mary bar we knew we had to! This morning we came in and were greeted by Linda immediately and Joe the owner. Wow that is some amazing customer service! The food was top notch and the chicken waffles definitely didn't disappoint!! This is a MUST stop for breakfast if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"We tried out The Hash Kitchen one Sunday morning for brunch as our friend went the previous day and absolutely raved about it. We walk in and the restaurant's decor was very open and inviting with very neutral colors, I loved it! We got sat right away and our server, Vincent, came over shortly after. I started off with a Bloody Mary from the Bloody Mary bar and my boyfriend got the mimosa flight (how cool!). The Bloody Mary bar was okay - not as good as everyone was raving about, however. They give you options for infused-vodka (awesome) as well as your choice of Bloody Mary mix (nice!). You do have a lot of options for the garnishes but over half of the items on the bar, I didn't know what they were...possibly use signs in the future? While that wasn't the best feature, the actual Bloody Mary was delicious and had the right about of spice to it. As for the mimosa flight, the bartender picks out 4 different flavors for the day so you can get to try different tastes other than the traditional champagne + oj.

We never get starters for breakfast but as soon as we saw the Brunch Bruschetta, we had to try it & we are so glad we did! 10/10 HIGHLY recommend.
For breakfast, I got the Breakfast Burrito which had really nice flavors to it and filled me up quick! As for my boyfriend, he got a la carte items as he is very picky when it comes to breakfast ;) 
Overall, we were very happy with everything that The Hash Kitchen offered. Multiple people, other than Vincent, came over to our table to check on us which made us feel welcomed. Service was fantastic and everyone was super friendly.
Would highly recommend The Hash Kitchen...we will be back!"}
{"text":"Yelp folks, don't get me wrong about Hash Kitchen. Food was good, service good. Nice place for breakfast, indoor and outdoor dining. 
What ruined a nice \"relaxing\" breakfast was when a DJ (??) chimed in and started BLASTING HIGH BASEY RAP MUSIC!! WTF???  Sunday morning breakfast to this??  Sorry but not at all expected. Asked manager if they could at least tone it down. Nope, it's \"the charm\" of the place. 
Won't go back."}
{"text":"Exceptional food. Very poor service. The gentleman next to us finally left after no one came to take his order. We waited close to 15 minutes until someone even came to our table. Hire more servers!"}
{"text":"Highly suggest bringing your whole crew here :)
Be sure to try the beef hash, and create your own juicy Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Man by far the worst eggs Benedict dish ive ever endured. English muffins not toasted at all. Hollandaise cold and Tasteless. Potatoes cold and all veggies in hashbrowns un cooked. Coffee great but could not get bartender to get me cream before coffee turned cold. The bloody mary bar looked great."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about Bonnie! I hosted my daughters birthday brunch for 12 of her friends and they had the best time! The food is always delicious and fresh. Be prepared to WAIT! It gets busy especially during spring training.  The chillachillas and salmon BLT are sooo good!!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was amazing! Went on a Saturday morning and there was absolutely no wait! My friend and I both started with mimosas. The majority of it was champagne so no complaints here! I had the herb fried chicken and waffles which was honestly the best chicken and waffles I've had in my life. My friend had the corn beef hash with her eggs scrambled and she loved it! There was also a live dj playing all the jams to get us in the proper brunching mood! Overall great experience and we'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and sweetest staff especially Bonnie. She say our 25 family group in less then 5 min on a busy Friday morning! We had the best food and the decor is adorbs!"}
{"text":"Loved, loved The Hash Kitchen!!! This review is a bit late but I just had to review for this amazing brunch spot.  I was out in Scottsdale in November for my friend's bachelorette party and was recommended this place by a friend.  The reviews also made me want to come here.  So on Sunday we headed over & surprisingly didn't have a long wait!  We were told over an hour but it ended up only being 30 mins or less.  Great service!!  Bonnie was such a great hostess making sure everyone was having a great time.  Our waiter was also super nice.  We all ordered mimosas and then realized let's switch it to a sampler since we ordered different flavors.  I found our waiter & he had already done that for us.  Talk about customer service! 

The Bloody Mary bar looked amazing too.  It's actually a bar with someone behind the counter giving you your preferred choice of alcohol.  Then you walk around the bar and add your toppings.  A couple of us ended up getting one to share & it was tasty.  Although having a bartender make the drink always tastes better! 

I can't remember what I ordered but it was delicious!  We had the booth seat near the DJ and I loved his cap; it said #Hash !! Although I expected more of a party style place it was still a great experience. Bonnie was definitely entertaining & friendly!"}
{"text":"Not good food, but seems to be packed often.  I just don't understand that.  Our first experience here was so bad that I sent my meal back and got a second breakfast which was not much better.  I vowed never to go back, but my wife has been with her friends who think it is great on 3 more occasions, and each time she has come home saying it was a terrible breakfast.  So I cannot understand the attraction to this place.  If you want a great breakfast, and we've been to them all, try the Breakfast Joynt or Cafe Paris both in Scottsdale.
The Breakfast Joynt has the best bacon, eggs benedict, and swedish pancakes in town.
Cafe Paris, near Costco, has the most incredible French crepes I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today and wasn't impressed at all. This place is way too over hyped. Food was overpriced and tasteless. Service was extremely slow and our server wasn't attentive. We stayed awhile talking after we ate and they didn't clear our dirty plates until 30 minutes later. It's all about looks here. Nice dining room but boring food and slow service. I'll go to Breakfast Joynt instead."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great and trendy.  Even with reservations it still took 15 minutes to sit us.  My husband ordered a bloodymary and the bar didn't restock anything.  The sausage/meatballs were cold even though they were in the warmers.  He didn't care for the bloodymary at all.  .   Food overall was good.  Not as many vegetarian options and the quantities are big enough to share.  Our waitor kept disappearing and I had requested to have a salad made vegetarian but the chef supposely said no they couldnt do that. They did not have any vegetarian protein options either in their menu.  Their online menu was different as well.  It's overpriced but not bad."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or brunch. Bloody Mary options were awesome. Had the carnitas hash. So good and large portions. Bring your appetite, or a close friend"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Cool different takes on classic dishes and an awesome Bloody Mary bar with all the fixings. Service was a bit slow but the food was dynamite."}
{"text":"Dirty floor, tables sitting with dirty dishes for far  too long, and slow, awful service. Food was fine but the place is just not run well. Too many great breakfast spots in Scottsdale to eat here again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, interesting Bloody Mary bar, very charming service. The dishes that we tried were lacking in flavor and the fruit board smothered with a sticky sweet sugar drizzle of some kind.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing. Servings are HUGE - enough to split three ways."}
{"text":"We went here yesterday for the first time and we will definitely be going back. The ambience is light and fun, the menu is huge and everything looks so good it was difficult to decide. They have a huge Bloody Mary bar if that's your thing. I ordered a mimosa and it was delicious. The wait staff was great and for a Saturday morning, the wait was only about 10 minutes. Definitely adding this to my rotation of regular brunch places."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast during the week. Arrived with a greet and smiling server. Very helpful in seating my family with a toddler and baby. Their baby seat had a liner which was a plus. Service was great. Food was very delicious. Ordered Paella hash and Flat iron steak hash. Ordered buttermilk pancake for the kiddos. Our server suggested to get the half order since the are huge. I appreciated her recommendation. Large portions and was definitely full after. Delicious food, great service and nicely designed restaurant. Will come back again soon for the custom margarita bar."}
{"text":"Everyone at this location is super friendly! My friend and I walked in on a Saturday morning around 10:30. There was no wait and we decided to sit at the bar. We both ordered the mimosa flight. It was awesome! We sat next to the build your own bloody bar and judged how good people's choices were! We had a great time and our food was really tasty! I had the breakfast bruschetta and my friend had the chilaquiles and we were both happy after! We will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Great time after bike ride over, we split the lemon ricotta pancakes (OMG, wonderful), and the \"boring beni\" (yes, I ordered that).   Great mimosa (ruby red grapefruit), but a little small (hey, what should one expect for $6?)."}
{"text":"Well this place was packed, so we sat at the bar, expectations high. The service was so slow. But we were in no hurry. Big menu. Bloody Mary was so spicy could not taste anything else. Bottomless mimosas were not coming very fast and were probably 4-5 ozs each. I ordered biscuits and gravy. She ordered a salmon Benedict. Biscuits were decent. Gravy absolutely tasteless. Her dish was hardly edible. I tried some salmon and it was so hard, overcooked by 5 minutes at least. Brunch was $60 with tip. Ouch for really bad food and drinks."}
{"text":"Second time and first time was better.    This establishment is popular but I think because of the \"new place hype\" and excellent location. 
   The noise on a Sunday is overwhelming.  A DJ was blasting from a non esoteric dirty amplified mono speaker that would be suitable at a tawdry pool party at a non selective sorority at a C school. 
  The food was mediocre today and my frittata was dry,  eggs overcooked and taste underwhelming.  I suspect at least one of the cooks was either self medicating from the OSHA multiple worker safety violation ridden noise with earplugs or magic gummy bears. 
  The manager didn't think the pool party techno and bad 80s music blasting was inappropriate and a part  owner we complained to seemed very annoyed that we were giving honest feedback and started dancing awkwardly like she was reliving an ecstasy experiment from a couple decades ago.  She then came back to show some empathy, but I'm not sure how earnest her new interest was as we started to get glares from some of the wait staff.   
   This is definitely not a place to bring your parents (unless they are drunk or want to get drunk) or younger children. 
  Doubt we'll be going back."}
{"text":"The sweet potato hash is the best! The service was also amazing, I highly recommend this spot for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place to eat! I went with coworkers and not a single person had a complaint or negative thing to say. We went for lunch on a Friday, so I can't speak as to what the wait might be for Sunday brunch, but we had no wait. The restaurant is open, airy and bright. Casual atmosphere and not too pricey. 

Hash Kitchen boasts a Bloody Mary bar which I will definitely be back to try. I had the veggie scramble and it was so good. Several vegetarian options. Everyone's food looked and smelled amazing. I have literally 0 complaints. Great service, great food, great restaurant. Awesome place for breakfast, lunch, or best of both worlds: brunch. You are missing out if you haven't tried it!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and must tell you that their breakfast and brunch are excellent. I'm a fan of their pancakes, though Perk Eatery has better.

This place is lively on the weekends at breakfast time, and can frequently have a wait. DJs play music at just the right volume to keep the ambiance upbeat without making it hard to hear your tablemates."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  Very crowded and very loud though.  The mimosa flight was fun!"}
{"text":"I went here on my birthday today and the customer service was excellent, the whole staff was attentive and friendly to us.   The menu was  great and the food was good.  Needless to say we were both full and had to be rolled out of there.  Check it out at least once."}
{"text":"I had lunch here recently in a big group and the hostess was very nice.

I had frittata your choice which were smoke salmon, spinach and parmesan cheese, it was good but I wish they add more spinach. The frittata came with hash brown potatoes and it was delicious!

Overall experience was excellent!"}
{"text":"I got my order to go, so I'm sure the food would've been a bit better had I dined in.  I had the huevos rancheros hash and it was pretty tasty.  The only complaint I had was that the carne asada was in huge pieces and a little tough, so it made eating it a bit difficult, especially with disposable utensils.  I hope that the next time I'm in Scottsdale, I'm there on a weekend so I can come back (dine in!) and try one of those jazzy-looking bloody marys or mimosa flight."}
{"text":"Summary: good food, great service, great atmosphere. I had the carrot cake pancakes and was blown away. It was like eating dessert for breakfast. The drinks were also very good: we had fresh squeezed orange juice, coffee (I would come back just for the coffee), and of course I hit up the Bloody Mary bar (what a cool concept!). Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"So... I fell in love with the bloody Mary bar last time I was here so couldn't WAIT to come back...Came in and was seated immediately...however...I've been sitting ungreeted and unacknowledged ever since..Sat for a good 20 minutes before going up to the bloody Mary bar and buying one directly from the bartender Lisa (SHE is amazing and friendly - offered to find out who my server was. I declined, never dreaming I would get ignored for another half hour lol)...with my seat and purse in view the whole time WAITING TO WAVE at a server...that never showed...Now...I'm back  in my seat  (literally yelping as i wait)and have been for a good 20 minutes working through my bloody Mary and fixins....STILL no server or order taken...Others around me have come in and gotten food...I'm disappointed....they're not even as busy as last time (earlier in the morning then)...but regardless no-one has even ASKED if my order has been taken :(...Once I'm done with this Delicious drink (bacon vodka yum) I've paid for, guess I'll go find a place to actually EAT ..."}
{"text":"Food was OK but, no atmosphere and extremely noisy. A large room and sound bounces all over."}
{"text":"We love this place...great food and an attentive wait staff... especially the hostess Bonnie who always goes out of her way to recognize my mom...thumps up!"}
{"text":"I went to Hash Kitchen for a birthday brunch today with friends. Alyssa was our server. Hash Kitchen has a great selection of cocktails, breakfast, and lunch options. I love that they also have options for vegetarians, as one of my friends needed this. My friends ordered the mimosa flight and I ordered the Hash Cocktail. The drinks were great and arrived promptly. We sat outside on the dog friendly patio to enjoy the weather. We each ordered different breakfast options: the mexicana scramble, chicken and waffles, and then the Art frittata. The food came and we all loved the presentation. The food was amazing and the menu has so many different options. I love the Hash Kitchen and the great staff. The inside and outside is so cute, and if you love Bloody Mary's, definitely take advantage of their build your own Bloody Mary bar with 40 toppings!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. This was our second visit. We came for the Bloody Mary bar. It's a fun novelty. The bar was lacking a few items that were available the last time (ex. Oysters, cheese sticks) but still had enough to turn a drink into a small meal. We still ordered breakfast and were not disappointed. The food is good and our waiter Alec was the best. He is what took this restaurant from a four to a five star. The cons would be how loud the music was playing inside. It's loud enough that conversation can be difficult."}
{"text":"What a great place, amazing staff, amazing food, cool environment. Dj plays music while you eat. Great bloody Mary bar."}
{"text":"Really poor experience. I don't normally post, but it was so bad I had to...
Was anxious to try this place out. A good breakfast place is the best!
Was there on a Wed morning and it was about 1/2 full. I sat at the bar because I was alone and wanted to get in/out quickly. Took a while for the bartender to get to me because it seemed like he was serving about 1/2 the restaurant as well. Seemed understaffed. I ordered the carne asada/eggs breakfast and coffee. It came out and the carne asada was like shoe leather... terrible. The potatoes were cold and the tortillas were so stuck to the paper they were wrapped in, i had to peel them off in sticky chunks. The eggs were good and the coffee was good. Needless to say, I barely ate any of it. I wanted to send it back, but the bartender was so busy I couldn't get him to come back over and I had to leave. I paid the bill ($20+$4 tip, since I didn't think it was the bartenders fault that he was so stretched), which I thought was outrageous for what it was. Anyway, I probably won't go back. Shame since it's so close to home."}
{"text":"We were at this restaurant for almost two hours on a Sunday.  We waited almost 45 minutes to be seated and only because we asked finally.  They were not sitting people in the order of arrival.  Food took about 35 minutes to come out.  We were very hungry at this point.  I would give them four stars for the food quality and definitely five stars for the Bloody Mary bar and atmosphere (kiddos for the dancing host lady all dressed up).  I would go back but early since this place gets packed."}
{"text":"Another great  meal from them. Monkey bread is scrumptious, great coffee,  love corned beef hash and enjoyed the DJ's oldschool mixed witn today's hits. No wait time."}
{"text":"Currently my favorite breakfast place. Such a fun place to be and i can't stay away from the mimosa flight. Jamie was an amazing server- we'll be back and definitely ask for her again."}
{"text":"Food, service and ambiance was all average at best. Another Scottsdale breakfast Restaraunt that will simply do well because it's better than IHOP (but not by much)."}
{"text":"Had breakfast Saturday befor Easter- changed menu a bit and hostess informed us upon seating that several items from regular menu were still available- ie breakfast burrito.  Imagine my dismay when that item actually was not available ! Damn she should have just kept mouth shut or knew what hell she was talking about .  Really had taste for that. What I ended up with was  only so so- crab eggs benedict over biscuits- flavor profile fairly odd.  However on ALL my past visits food has been delish!

On to my server TAYLOR- she was awesome!!! Her second day and seemed like she had been working there for years-attentive curteous and sweet.  Cant rave enough.  If all servers were so great it would be a pleasure to dine out at all meals!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I met up here yesterday for a nice long-winded \"download\" visit over lunch. I arrived about 10 minutes before she did, so I put my name on the Wait List and tucked myself in the corner of the foyer as it was pretty busy.

The DJ was on the bar side and it was L O U D. So loud, it made me wince, to be honest. Because DJ was so loud, the patrons had to talk loudly to hear themselves so it was just sort of stressful. I was adamant about NOT sitting to the right (bar side).

I dunno... I guess this (DJ Pauly-dude spinning vinyl) feels more natural at a restaurant in the bowels of Old Town, not North Scottsdale. Someplace like R&R, or Geisha-A-Go-Go...? You know??

The hostess/other lady (maybe owner?) kept asking me if my party of 2 wld like to sit at the bar (multiple times). I kept repeating to them I didn't want to because it's too loud and I wanted to visit w/my friend. Very annoying.

My friend and I did get seated to the left side of the restaurant and it was much quieter. 

Our server (didn't catch name) was great! I ordered one of his recommendations (Pork Carnitas Hash Skillet w/2 corn tortillas) and was glad, as it was pretty tasty. Pork was nicely seasoned and moist! Came in a small cast-iron skillet pan which was a nice touch. Couldn't help but notice a good amount of grease pooled at the bottom of skillet pan that made my throat close, but it was still good."}
{"text":"This is my second time to the Hash Kitchen with my fiancée Kimberly, and we cannot rave anymore about this place than we already do. The staff is always on top of their game especially the owner/manager Linda, one of most friendliest persons I've met in any eating establishment ever. But besides the amazing service is the incredible food. We have ordered several things of the menu over our two visits and have always left full and satisfied with our choices. This restaurant is certainly becoming one of our favorites for brunch! Check it out ASAP!"}
{"text":"Probably the funnest brunch experience I've had. We went on a Sunday morning around 11 and had about an hour wait. But during that wait you can order drinks at the bar and build your own bloody Mary's ! You just pay for the cup and fill your cup with whatever toppings you want and munch on that while waiting. It makes the wait seem to go by a lot quicker. 
Gotta admit, the service is where one star gets knocked off. They are very busy and they seemed a bit understaffed. When we looked inside there were quite a few empty tables so they couldn't turn them around quickly. 
But the food and drink were solid. Their hash is the way to go. My group of friends and I ordered 5 different ones. And they were all unique and tasty in their own ways. Also, their mimosas flights are 16 dollars for 4 glasses which I think is a great deal.
Would love to come back if I'm in the area again !"}
{"text":"What an incredible experience! Our waiter was so nice and totally accommodating and welcoming. Love love this place! I don't remember our waiter's name but he had black framed glasses and was such a great asset to this restaurant! Wish they had this restaurant in California!"}
{"text":"Open your mouth and let me shove this killer breakfast joint's food in your face! Ya...that good. The date was Mothers day and it was packed! My Wife made reservations well in advance and when we arrived we had to wait. We waited 30+ minutes. Big fucking deal. Put your snappy chat, instagram and twitter down and spend some time....you know, talking and hugging it out with your Family. The Restaurant brought out Mimosa's to the hungry and thirsty. I thought they handled themselves well considering the mob and the special day! All that aside, yelp is not about your rude waitress, the slow cook time. We want to know about the food. Every Chef, cook, hostess and waiter/waitress is bound to have a bad day. Please stop bitching about that stuff. Get down to the food. We had a large group and here is a list of everything I actually tasted.

Lemon Ricotta Pancakes - Awesome. Buttery, Lemony, Crisp and Soft edges with moist middle. Almost my favorite ever. Served with a delicious Lemon ricotta topping.

Canolli Donut - Excellent. I would expect canolli creme to be fantastic coming from a Tomasso. 

Carne Asada Hash Skillet - Perfectly marinated flat iron with two perfectly poached eggs. Very flavorful on a bed of hash brown cubes potatoes, they could have been crispier and green chilis.

Oreo Pancakes - Delicious in their own right, did not taste much like an OREO. That being said, they were still cream worthy. ya, know...OREO cream worthy.

Carrot Cake Pancakes - Damn good. Like if Upper crust bakery from the long ago Timothy's decided to make pancakes. The crispy fried carrots on top was spot on, different and texturally tasty.

Lamb Hash - Bomb. Period. If you love lamb don't miss this. Juicy seasoned lamb with poached eggs and browns. Good Shit!!

Smoked salmon Benedict. Really, should I go on. Excellent!!

Lastly.... Fruity Pebble Yogurt Breakfast Popcicles. Holy Shit Fred. What a fun and tasty way to start a breakfast. Not filling and full of flavor. I never thought it would work but those pops blew me away. Like a palleta pop thats creamy, a bit tangy from the yogurt and sweet and crispy. Yah, it's good.

That's it. I did not taste one thing that was meh. All food exceeded my expectations. The owner was out and he was very accomodating considering how busy he was. He was funny, relaxed and a small part of why my Family will be back. Can't wait. Fortunate they are right down the road from my house. My waiter. who my Wife said was a manager...I don't know how...was really good. He actually came back and thanked me for my tip. I think he was stunned, I was hoping that if I made him happy, since he made me and my Family happy, that mood would transcend to other diners waiting in the mad house. 

Cheers"}
{"text":"Linda our gracious host and her fabulous team took such excellent care of me and my ladies for my 24th birthday celebration! We tried just about everything on the menu and our favorites were Lump Crab and sweet potato hash, the steel cut oats, biscuits and gravy, Quinoa Burger, and the herb chicken hash. Everything was fresh, came out hot, had excellent taste, and left us wanting more! We particularly enjoyed the build your own Bloody Mary bar ( endless bacon and beef jerky, can you say heaven!?) and the crisp mimosas. The service was OUTSTANDING I have never had such attentive staff. We love the Hash kitchen and all its employees!! Thank you Linda!!!

P.S. The atmosphere is amazing with a live jazz band, DJ, and modern decor. We felt very comfortable and quite high class. Pricing is very affordable and we were pleasantly surprised by the menu options :)"}
{"text":"The venue was fresh and artistic. The music makes you feel younger again. The food and service outstanding ! Chris and Linda wonderfully friendly attentive and engaging! What a wonderful find on our trip from San Francisco to spring training."}
{"text":"There are few places that exceed your expectations when it comes to the food, the atmosphere, and the customer service.  But this one truly does. My husband and I enjoyed our visit to the Scottsdale location and can't wait to return. The portions are substantial and the seasoning is spot. It was gourmet quality with the flavor of my mama's comfort food rolled into one meal...very difficilt to master, but they have! I had to take half to go!  This will be a go-to eatery for people I really like ! Bonnie, the owner is the sweetest! Thank you Ms Bonnie for treating us like family. Much love from Marie and Keenan!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and presentation. 

Wide variety of breakfast and lunch choices. Natural burger was big and delicious. Eggs were perfectly prepared. 

Be aware, music loud on weekends and a young crowd. 

For me..no problem. Go to the kitchen and get what you want... you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've never been to such an innovative restaurant! Everything on the menu sounded delicious. I opted for the s'mores french toast and it was to die for. Ask for Lona, she made the experience that much more perfect!"}
{"text":"Two years ago when I lived here this was my go to brunch spot. I feel like the food is not as good as it used to be. They discontinued the unlimited mimosa and now all you can get is one or a flight but sometimes the flights flavors are not my favorite. Unfortunately I had a very weak pour Bloody Mary after I paid for the Bloody Mary bar. Definitely good spot for a fun time or groups but like I said the quality is not what it used to be."}
{"text":"pretty place, very good food, awesome service !
 we don't often go out for breakfast, but this was a special day. LEO, our server, made our experience very special !
 He suggested the French press coffee, and showed up at just the right time to \"press and pour\". He recommended a fruit plate while we looked over the menu, which was perfect for a leisurely style brunch experience.
 Leo seemed very knowledgeable about the menu and encouraged us to ask ANY questions; we chose the smoked salmon eggs benedict and the Brisket and Eggs, based on his recommendations, BOTH were filling and flavorful, and just as he described .
Too full for dessert, but he said he made a \"killer mocha\" which we shared, our only mistake not getting two; we will be back, great brunch experience !"}
{"text":"Skip the other highly rated breakfast spots and go here, and then go back again!! This place exceeded our expectations! Not only was the food delicious, the atmosphere was so much fun. I wish I liked Bloody Mary's as they looked amazing! There was a DJ playing great music. All in all it was a great way to start the day! 
P.S. The service was good too!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Mimosas, food, build your own bloody bar. Definitely worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot you can tell food is fresh and homemade adult beverages are definitely a plus at 11 o'clock in the morning came on a Sunday and there was even a DJ spinning tunes definitely will be back and definitely recommend this place to others check out my photos I had the Mexican scrambler and my wife had the lump crab cake with sweet potato hash then there was the doughnut cannoli"}
{"text":"This was probally the worst breakfast experience, I have ever had. I walked in seeing an amazing looking bloody mary bar and dj, and was very excited for our breakfast. I saw that I knew the bartender Joe so was equally amped. The food and service unfortunately did not meet the expectations. We waited for 15 to 20 minutes to get our order taken. The restaurant was not that busy, and there was plenty of staff. Our server did have time to talk with coworkers at the bar pos. Food was not noteworthy. If the food was better I would come back and just sit at the bar to avoid such terrible service."}
{"text":"In the area for an appointment and needed a good place for breakfast.  Lucky me it was early enough that I had the whole restaurant to myself!  It's nicely decorated, clean and the music not too loud. 

I had excellent service from Jen. I was having a hard time deciding between a few items on their extensive menu when she suggested a half plate of each. When the food arrived it was nicely plated and for only half was pretty large. Everything tasted really good, I'd definitely recommend the s'mores french toast. 

If by any chance I'm in the area again I'll be sure to stop in to try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"We came in based on a review in the paper on their French Toast. Note, all French toast options are dipped in ice cream so they are very rich. Hubby ordered the almond coconut with bananas. They were delish - but was best shared by two!  

I was torn - so many great specialties - several types of hash, great special items (corned beef fried rice!!) but I decided to try the Herbed Chicken Benedict. The chicken was great, and the biscuits were good. The eggs were cooked perfectly.  And the onion straws were fabulous!  Two things kept us from giving a perfect rating.   They were very stingy on the hollandaise sauce, so the overall taste was a bit dry. The hash browns were barely tan - next time, we will request extra crispy!  

With wonderful service from Vincent and a cloud covered day on the patio it was a great experience. We will be back - so many great breakfast options. And a sneak peak at the lunch menu looks awesome!"}
{"text":"First time on a Sunday. Had a 1.5 hour wait but it  as totally worth it! Delicious bloody Mary's, mimosas and the food is amazing!!! Bonnie is an absolutely gem and so much fun to come chat with!!!"}
{"text":"Very good for a weekend brunch! The Bloody Mary was spot on. Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"The Hash Kitchen is awesome.  The food is delicious, the service is outstanding, the Bloody Mary bar is crazy-good!  We stopped here on a whim on Thanksgiving morning as we had arrived via a very early flight from Colorado.  Thank goodness they were open!  We were absolutely delighted with the entire experience.  We would've loved to come back during our visit to AZ, but unfortunately our schedule would not allow it!  These photos of our food just don't do it justice!  Can't wait to come back in a future visit!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast/brunch spots around. I love this place the mood is perfect and the food is incredible. You have to try this place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was a great choice for Arizona Breakfast Weekend! My brother and I came on a Sunday morning when they opened and basically had the cute place to ourselves. Our waitress Jen was great and attentive as we ordered from their ABW menu. I started with an iced tea (comes in an adorable glass jar with a handle) and we both got their cannoli donut, a sweet start to the day. For my entree, I chose the shrimp \"Oscar\" hash which has crispy potatoes, roasted prawns, asparagus, and a bernaise sauce. It was a huge dish! Felt like I barely made a dent in it but was happy to take it home for the family to try. It was yummy too. My brother got their banana brioche French toast and the sampling I had from it was really good.

At $15/person, this was a fantastic way to check out a new (to me) restaurant and their selections. I'd like to come back and peruse their entire menu.

Side note: when we were leaving, I really noticed their sign outside the entrance. It does not match the architecture of the building and think it could use an upgrade!"}
{"text":"I've had a number of great brunches here since they opened. Yesterday I had family in from out of town, and after showing them the menu, this was an easy sell. The food and drinks were fantastic, and our server Gino was the icing on cake. He was great; what a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Nice, fun breakfast spot. We went to the Hash Kitchen on a busy Sunday morning. They seated another party with our name so our wait dragged on a bit, but that happens. We passed the time waiting for our table at the bloody mary bar. We had the spicy one and it was tasty and had a bit of a fun kick to it.

For our meal, we had the corned beef hash with the biscuit. The hash was fresh and tasty and the corned beef was in large pieces that were delicious.

Sadly, the bathroom was pretty dirty and although I realize it was busy, they seem to have enough staff around that someone should be checking on it periodically.

All in all, a solid experience. I will try them again on weekday."}
{"text":"Great taste, great service, great portions and excellent Italian coffee.  Highly recommend.  Wonderful to visit and will return back on our next trip from Hawaii.  Ask for Gino, fun guy!!"}
{"text":"Once again this place never disappoints. SO yummy. And an amazing environment. Staff is attentive and food is always quickly served. You HAVE to try the breakfast Popsicles. Biscuits are freshly made from scratch and taste like little nuggets of heaven when you add their berry jam. Their hash dishes are really good, I would rate this my favorite breakfast spot in all of AZ. Give it a try, you won't regret it. Bonnie is amazing and makes each visit better! Love this place, and you will too!"}
{"text":"Super cute atmosphere, live DJ, great food, Wonderful service!!
There is indoors and outdoor seating. The bar is in both areas."}
{"text":"Very nice selection. Fresh ingredients. Friendly service. I ordered the paella and was good. Their pancakes are delicious."}
{"text":"The Bloody Mary bar was AMAZING!  The cilantro lime infused vodka had a nice kick & all the toppings had me going back for seconds.  

The french press coffee was also very good.

I had the chicken and waffles, which were delicious & I would love to try them again.  

The bartender at the Bloody Mary bar told us they have a DJ on the weekends, which would definitely be worth checking out.
 
The decor in this restaurant is very boutique.  I loved how nice it was & it really had a different feel than most breakfast spots in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service.  The music is upbeat and fun and so is the stsff.  Bonnie is a spectacular hostess and Evan is a super cool server with great recommendations.  Food was served quickly and accurately.  We had the carnitas hash and the corned beef hash with some mildly spicy Bloody Mary's. Everything was flavorful and delicious."}
{"text":"Bonni I want to thank you for the best atmosphere the best drinks and the best food! God Keep blessing this place"}
{"text":"A wonderful addition to the neighborhood!!! Beautiful bar and an amazing Bloody Mary bar!!!! And the food??? Forget about it!!! Gino was awesome and hooked us up with his menu favorites. We will be back.....probably tomorrow!!! :)

Went back on 11/22; KATIE = Rockstar.
We are 2 for 2....hoping to be back tomorrow!!!!

11/23....yup back again and can say; 3 for 3!! Great lump crab frittata!!!! Thank you, Joey....great new neighborhood breakfast bar!!!"}
{"text":"Super cute place! Great brunch spot- the food is delicious and the atmosphere is the cutest. The mimosa flight is such a great buy too- I will definitely be getting it everytime I come! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Hash kitchen is my favorite! Drinks (mimosa flight, Bloody Mary bar with meatballs), amazing. Weekend DJ, amazing. Food (cannoli donut, lump crab anything, burgers, plus everything is made from scratch), amazing. Bonnie, amazing."}
{"text":"Super cool breakfast hang spot. I went there with a party of 7 and they were more then accommodating. It took us maybe 20 minutes to get a table which is above average for places this popular. The service was good and the food was good as well. We tried many different things and the fries appetizer with egg on top was great. There is a semi typical Scottsdale crowd here so if that's not your thing maybe this isn't the spot for you. The portions are large and pretty much everyone at our table took food home with them. I had the corned beef hash plate and it was very good. Everything was clean and the Bloody Mary bar was insanely cool. I would recommend hash kitchen to my friends and will be back once again when I'm in the area. They did good with this place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I have taken my whole family there twice now and both times have been worth every penny. When we arrived (my girlfriend and our two daughters) we were greeted by Bonnie. She is amazing and we will back to see her and enjoy the French toast again soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Fast and efficient service.   Ordered the Chicken Waffle and it was OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"Although I enjoy a good breakfast, our quest to find new brunch spots has gradually subsided in recent years. This is largely due to the fact that my girlfriend and I have already went through grueling trial and error experiments in an attempt to firmly establish a set of reliable favorites. And after all, who wants to spend a late Sunday morning experimenting at unfamiliar breakfast places that risk being colossal failures?

But dammit, I keep insisting: Try new places! Don't be like my parents and keep dining at the same five restaurants in constant rotation over the course of two decades. And for this reason, I decided that it was time that we start searching again.
 
In many ways, I kind of already knew what to prepare myself for while going into The Hash Kitchen (THK). It's one of those entrepreneur \"concept\" restaurants - and one that caters more to the current trends of the modern brunch/bar hybrid - complete with the required thumpy music and flowing mimosa flights. 

Joking aside, I really didn't expect much. I've been to places like this before and always end up disappointed in comparison to some of our favorite spots in terms of food quality. Boozing before noon doesn't interest me, so my judgment lies strictly on the food taste.

But in all honesty, we ended up both being impressed with the offerings at THK after a couple of visits. Although there are a handful of menu items that are served at most modern breakfast joints, including the mandatory dessert-like French toast variations, there's also many dishes that are quite unique.

I'm a big fan of their Huevos Rancheros Hash, which includes the potatoes themselves, black beans, cotija, a few tortillas, over medium eggs, avocado, carne asada, and red chili sauce. Their Carnitas Hash is also worth mentioning. My girlfriend also experimented with their breakfast lasagna, but insists that their hash plates are the safer choice.

On a side note, we obtained a half-order of coconut and almond encrusted French toast. We both really liked it, although my gut tells me the Nutella and banana variation would have probably won me over completely. Unfortunately, it's off the menu and when I attempted to order it on a return visit, they claim it doesn't exist anymore - despite having all of the ingredients. 

Coffee was good (Lavazaa), while OJ was also some of the best you can find.

Service can vary. During our second visit, our food took forever - to the point where I wish the server would have just admitted that they forgot to put the order in. On a positive, they're all very friendly.

The bottom line is, don't go in here expecting to find a traditional breakfast joint. And in some ways, that's a good thing - as I think as long as you approach this place with an open mind, you'll easily find something here that you can appreciate.

Recommended!"}
{"text":"After having a stellar brunch experience at THK Scottsdale Road a few weeks ago, we decided to test out their other spot, which is located on Frank Lloyd Wright. Strange as it may be, the locations are really not too far apart.

Unlike our first visit, we showed up a little earlier on Sunday morning. As a result, we experienced this place in full-force, including the DJ, extended wait times, and extremely busy servers. Despite this, the place was never too loud to the point where we couldn't have a conversation. While the whole bar/breakfast hybrid concept that screams \"Scottsdale\" has never really been my thing, when done properly, it can work for practically everyone.

Okay. So, let's talk food.

I went with the Italian Hash while my girlfriend ordered the Carnitas Hash. Both were good, but the carnitas was clearly the winner of the two - packing excellent flavor in the meat that just fit in perfectly with the potatoes and eggs. The Italian, which includes sausage, wasn't too bad, but not something I'd order again.

They have apparently removed their Nutella/banana french toast from the menu that we've always wanted to try. Instead, we opted for the churro pancakes.

Okay, this is where I have a problem.

I hate places that charge \"premium\" prices for pancakes that are subpar. They often attempt to mask this by offering up creative flavors, toppings, or those trendy little \"flight\" plates. Unfortunately, all it took was one slice with my fork to watch these things instantaneously crumble up into inedible mush. My girlfriend attempted to cut a few pieces for herself, with similar results. Ugh! I expect flaws from places like IHOP or Denny's, but definitely not THK. It is what it is, I guess. But we definitely won't be taking a risk on pancakes again. Successfully transferring the remaining cakes from the plate to the leftover box required a tremendous amount of caution, as we fully expected them to fall apart completely. On a side note, the owner contacted me about this issue (very quickly I might add) and attempted to make it right. So I do give them credit for having some very good customer service.

Their OJ is consistently good (I had two glasses), while they serve up the always superbly tasting Lavazaa coffee. You really can't go wrong in that department.

Overall, I still think they offer up an excellent breakfast - but if, and only if, you know exactly what to get. 

Give them a try - just choose your items carefully."}
{"text":"I went to the Hash Kitchen for brunch a couple weekends ago and it was delicious. I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict along with the classic french toast. My boyfriend got the smoked sliced brisket and corn bread hash. My favorite part was definitely the smoked salmon eggs bennie. It was super flavorful and each bite seemed to melt in my mouth. The french toast was alright and I've definitely had better but I guess I shouldn't expect too much since I ordered the plain ones. The hash was pretty good but had a little bit too much corn bread and not enough brisket in our opinion. The service was fast and I would definitely come back to try those chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Lump crab hash was worth it! So were the Oreo cookie pancakes. Build Your Own Boiody bar is awesome. Our server, Chris, made the experience perfect!"}
{"text":"Great place and find!! Saw some Yelp reviews and was intrigued by the Bloody Mary bar- it was awesome!  We went after church on a recent Sunday.  Food and service excellent!  I ordered the original French toast- yummy!  My husband ordered a pork hash dish- also yummy!  We will return!"}
{"text":"Super fun place for brunch, food was delicious and the Bloody Mary Bar is an added bonus.(My advise... Get the Lump crab with sweet potato hash...simply yummness) Def. recommend it!"}
{"text":"Lively and spirited, younger crowd.  DJ on Sunday.  Bloody Mary bar and infused vodka variety.  Extremely interesting menu with bfast, sandwiches, salads bday catchy cocktails.  The fried chicken hash with crisp leeks in a skillet was tasty.  The salmon salad was delicious and filling.  Homemade biscuits and reduced maple syrup for the pancakes.  All yum."}
{"text":"I was very underwhelmed by my experience at Hash Kitchen - I had heard a lot of good reviews but not when I was there - - the service was terrible and the food was mediocre - - there are many other good places for breakfast in the Scottsdale area - -"}
{"text":"Ok so there is a bloody mary bar and then there is the hash kitchen bar... Who needs breakfast when you can build a colossal bloody mary chalked full of delicious bloody mary bites!  I kid you not, they have over 40 options for you to build a bloody mary, that's 40225345056 different combinations possible, based on Vodka preferences, bloody mary mixes, toppings! 

They have a super diverse menu that there is something for everyone, I love the corned beef hash, and the lump crab and sweet potato hash... I recommend staying away from the Herb Fried chicken, it sounds good in concept, execution hasn't been stellar the couple times I have ordered it.. The breading just isn't crispy. 

Word to the wise, they do have a have a DJ on the weekends that can get kind of well LOUD! Def worth a visit!"}
{"text":"The Hash Kitchen is so adorable and the food is so fresh and delicious. The inside is modern and they have a live DJ! Great for brunch, fairly priced, and mimosas (need I say more??) We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken salad sandwich. Sound different?  Had to try it and it was wonderful. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"5 stars because my son \"LOVED\"  his breakfast sandwich!  Everything we ordered was delicious from biscuits to corned beef hash to french toast. Extensive menu. Wanted to stay and try It all. It just kept getting better with super nice staff and great service. Elaborate bloody Mary bar. DJ playing great upbeat music. Happiness!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood Hash Kitchen! 2nd location so far with 2 more planned soon in Phoenix metro! Today's opening day and it's looking real good so far.  Quite busy too for day 1...lots of fans from the other location are happy to see a presence on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd.

This is by far the best breakfast choice around. Nice new clean interior and shaded parking nearby. Nice patio bar and table seating that's in morning shade year round. 

Unique menu, lots of cool options to try. Can't comment on the bloody Mary bar, never had one before, but it has a gazillion different items to add to yours.  Looking around I could see this was a popular item.  

Today I got the corned beef hash and it was the best I have ever had. It was AMAZING!!! They age it 2 weeks in house and it's so tender and well seasoned. Very impressed. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious restaurant! The Decor is perfect and the food is too. Healthy and filling! I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great time. I shall be back!"}
{"text":"My good friend Gino is the best. Forget about it! No one better. And what a take on Mexican breakfast. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"came here around 930am with a reservation on a saturday morning. it wasnt too busy. Great service.
ordered the corned beef hash scramble and it was ok but my daughter loved it, she also ordered the gluten free waffles, we found a hair like fiber in it, maybe from a butter brush or something like that ? my wife ordered the yogurt parfait and it had a sprinkle of granola, had to ask for some extra.  food was ok, but stuck out on this visit"}
{"text":"This was our first visit, and I cannot say enough about this place.  My husband was craving smoked brisket and eggs so he did a Google search and found The Hash Kitchen.  He started with a Berry Memosa and I had a Mocha Coffee with a side shot of Kaluhua to add as I drank it. It is incredibly delicious, (not to mention the waitress gave me a generous amount of Kaluhua in the shot). 

My husband had the smoked brisket, eggs over medium, hash potatoes and a side of pancakes. It was exactly what he was hoping it would be and so much more. The smoked brisket was bursting with flavor and came with a side of warm barbeque sauce that was sweet and tasty.  We shared the pancakes which were delicious as well. The reduced maple syrup is amazing!

I had the Lump Crab Eggs Benedict. It is two perfectly poached eggs on a split biscuit covered in a Bay Hollandaise and a generous amount of crab. Mine also included hash potatoes. The crab Benedict was the best thing to grace my taste buds in a long time. The hollandaise sauce had flawless consistency and flavor that paired perfectly with the thick custardardy yolk of the eggs, and decadent richness of the crab. The potatoes are okay, but not as flavorful. 

The service was wonderful as well. Our waitress,  Sara, was very friendly and on point. We will definitely be back. In fact this may become our regular Saturday morning breakfast hang out. There are many more items on the menu I cannot wait to try. I was going to take a photo of our plates, but I was so excited when the food came that I just dug right in and forgot all about the photo... LOL"}
{"text":"Great concept and well executed with tasty food and pro active service. I have enjoyed all meals I ordered here and especially recommend the chicken and waffles. Very well staffed with attentive team members. Will continue to support and explore the menu"}
{"text":"New little startup.  Had breakfast with my son.  Great food.  Excellent.  Typical disorganized start up.  A little slow on service, but absolutely worth the wait.

One idea folks:  train wait staff to refill all coffees as they pass.  

Great little place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"The Cristina's Tamale Cakes were excellent--the sauce, eggs, corn meal, and pork were exceptionally flavored.

I had to try this place a second time--the first it was busy and they were badly understaffed, so we didn't get served and left.  Glad I came back, because the service was much better and the food and Bloody Marias absolutely terrific."}
{"text":"If your coming to drink & party it up, this spot is for you. If your looking for good food and service, this probably isn't your spot. Neither of us are drinkers, so we can't say anything about the alcohol, although that seams to be their only focus, cuz the food defiantly wasn't. My husband wanted a simple \"pancake meal\" eggs, a couple pancakes, & some bacon; the most basic breakfast item in the country right?? Well not here! If you want that, it's all ale carte....adding up to over 20$ for a couple cakes, eggs & bacon. They don't have that basic meal. He got the French toast, dry & uncooked on the inside with hard as heck butter to go along (one of my biggest peeves, how are u suppose to spread that stuff?? I got a skillet with straight MUSH sweet potatoes & carnitas was just meh....if your coming to booze it up & party this is your spot. If your looking for good food, take a PASS"}
{"text":"Unreal Bloody Mary bar. We have been several time and it's always excellent. We can't wait for the Arcadia location to open. Our kids love it as well"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place we have ever been too !! Saturday morning DJ killer bar menu for drinks huge food menu place was packed but we were seated super Fast and served even faster it's our new official spot for breakfast"}
{"text":"LOVE IT HERE!!
Great food! Beautiful restaurant. So glad we can in this morning! 

Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The food, service, and atmosphere was amazing!! We loved how accommodating Bonnie was and our server Gino took great care of us and was so personable. We will be coming back very soon :)"}
{"text":"What a great/fun place with a fantastic Bloody Mary Bar, the service is excellent, the food is excellent, and...Bonnie made our experience so enjoyable, you can truly tell she loves what she does!!!"}
{"text":"I've been on a few occasions for brunch. Very nice atmosphere! Service is satisfactory but I found the food just mediocre. Not bad but not great! They do a cute mimosa flight with different flavors. I say try it for yourself, you just might like it!"}
{"text":"Quite loud inside but bar and patio are cool.   The Americana scramble I ordered with Jalapenos was delicious and they added the peppers with no problem.   Looks like the drinks are the special part of this breakfast place....I saw a mamosa flight that looked tasty..."}
{"text":"I went to The Hash Kitchen a few months ago and really enjoyed it.  Food was good and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Just had brunch at this place and it was great.  I went with 4 other friends who are part of a meetup group and we were treated wonderfully.  The menu is not your ordinary breakfast menu.  It is more upscale but the food is worth it.

I had the Huevos Rancheros Hash and it was delish.  I took half home for another meal.  The eggs were cooked just the way I like them. Very good.

Chris, our server, was excellent also.

Try it."}
{"text":"Tried this cute spot for our weekly brunch with friends last Sunday. Great ambience- bigger size than a lot of other local brunch spots that can get stuffy and overcrowded at busy rush times. The Bloody Mary bar has so many options for toppings, a bit intimidating for a first timer but the staff was very friendly and helpful. It turns out I'm an excellent Bloody Mary designer :) the food was delicious- we had the smoked salmon Benedict, Mexican chorizo omelet, biscuits and gravy and the breakfast burrito at our table- everything was very tasty! The biscuits were sweet, buttery and flakey. I can't wait to go back and try the lump crab Benedict next! Its also nice that they have TVs with the games on so the boys don't rush us home :)"}
{"text":"I worked with Erno to set up a farewell brunch for my book club retreat. He was absolutely awesome. He accommodated our party recommended a custom menu. The Hash Kitchen provided a reasonable price with 5 options to choose from. The restaurant accommodated our vegetarian and gluten free members with multiple options. The food was fantastic!!! I have never been a fan of bloody Marys, but since they were included I tried them. AMAZING! The mix there is not like any other place I have tried. Our server Chris worked his tail off. He provided excellent customer service. We were a large loud group, and The Hash accommodated us quickly and extremely well. I would recommend this place to anybody who wants great food, with great service. Thank you from BookTini."}
{"text":"Too expensive, small menu, all items are too sweet, coffee isn't that good even at 8:30 in the morning."}
{"text":"Good vibes, and good service, but average food. We had 3 scrambles and the corned beef hash and only the hash was really great."}
{"text":"Love this place! Such creative and fun menu items! The portions are also huge so I was able to save it for breakfast the next day, which is good because it's a bit pricey. They also have a Bloody Mary bar which is super fun. Fun atmosphere too. When we went they had a DJ so the energy was very high inside the restaurant. I will definitely return here for a special breakfast again!"}
{"text":"Second time here was a cluster. The front staff was very unorganized and unprofessional. I was told our wait would be 15 minutes. They proceeded to seat people that arrived after we did. We waited 25 minutes I finally asked the hostess and I was told the owners Doctor got precedence over us. That is the last time I attempt to eat here."}
{"text":"Good variety of mimosas, but that's about it! We met for brunch to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. They had a DJ, at 11:30am on Sunday.  It was so loud and ridiculous we could hardly hear ourselves talk (or think)! The food was mediocre, at best. I had the thick bacon & potato frittata and didn't even eat half of it (very heavy on white onions). The potatoes, that came on the side, we're practically straight out of a bag of \"Simply Potatoes\"-not joking. One gal did have the chicken and waffles and thought they were good, but the rest of us (party of 8) were not impressed with our food. The mimosas were heavy on champagne, which is good, but I got a headache shortly thereafter-which typically implies very cheap champagne was used. My friend had a Bloody Mary but it was not good, although they boast the best Bloody Mary bar in town. Then, we asked for split checks-which I understand is a pain in the rear, let me be clear. But my friend was kind enough to number everything so it could have easily been done. Our server took no less than 20 minutes, even with the key. At the end of the day, I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, great atmosphere and food. Had no trouble with my reservation and the staff was very efficient, food was absolutely delicious. The french toast was very filling! ILL BE BACK !!"}
{"text":"Requested to sit outside and was told waite was 45 minutes which, would have been great but, was surprised to be called back after an hour and sat inside Food was good and so was the service! Like all new restaurants they have issues to work out! Might go back in the future to re-evaluate"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the Mimosa Flight and Bloody Mary Bar! Great Customer Service!"}
{"text":"Positives: 
-Server was A++++. Took my playful banter and ran with it. 
-Decor is hip and minimal. Love the high ceilings. Gorgeous and huge indoor/outdoor bar.
-Mimosas.
-Bloody Marys. 

Not as positive: 
-Lump crab sweet potato hash was lacking in flavor. I think there was too much hash. Eggs were overcooked a bit with no run at all, which I'll attribute to being a part of a large table and they were probably trying to get everything out at once. 
-Nobody in our party was crazy about the cannoli donuts or breakfast bruschetta. 
-Steak and eggs wasn't anything special either. 

I mean, I'll go back there if someone brings me. Maybe I'd just stick to drinks at the bar and lower my expectations on the food."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch, great atmosphere. The outside is a bit too sunny, but worth it. I had the carnitas hash and I was really happy with how it tasted. It could of use more green salsa, in my opinion. The sangria was also delicious! Really enjoyed it for brunch! I was visitIng AZ, and loved it. I would come back when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I'll write another review next time I visit if need be.  I went there in a Sunday.  Wasn't feeling great so I didn't get what I would normally get for breakfast.  It was OK but the menu probably leaned more towards hash type stuff than the stuff I like.  I know, it's the Hash Kitchen....of course it does. My girlfriend loved her Hash though.

My complaint isn't really with the service, but when we were done eating, the \"get these people outta here and open up the table\" crew was in force. Constant peeks around the corner and asking if there's something else we want, etc. Even picked up the paid bill a second time and asked 'mistakenly' if we wanted to pay our bill. It was like the outlaw getting kicked out of a bar in the old west.  Doors swing open....we land on our butts.  I get turning our table is money...but wow.  Don't get me wrong...nobody was outwardly rude.  Just very passive aggressive.  

I'll give them another shot and change my review if justified."}
{"text":"Similar experience as Naoi. Was sat by older woman. 10 minutes later no server, no drink order, just some tasty water on the table. We were so excited to try some supposedly organic eats which is hard to find around here..was also excited about a grass fed burger and were already talking about coming back for it.
But alas 15 minutes in, as a matter of principle we had to walk out. The hostess and waittress said \"have nice day\" as if we just enjoyed a meal...all I could say was \"wow.\"
I, too dont write many bad reviews. But this was embarrasing. There was two other tables there.

Thanks to the bus boy for the water. Honestly we would have came here often. Below average service can be forgiven, but no service cannot..

Try harder. Please."}
{"text":"We always enjoy coming on Sunday. The DJ is there and big parties like the bar. Breakfast is wonderful. The wait is never terrible and it's comfortable on the patio while we wait."}
{"text":"Delicious food.... the bar looks amazing... very creative meals ... nice atmosphere .... won't find a better breakfast place anywhere"}
{"text":"We tried this when it was still pretty new and it was packed! I love how they decorate the place and love the staff who are friendly and fast! The food though is not really that extraordinary to set it  part from other breakfast spots in the area and would not justify the higher price point. But then again, this could be a nice place for that nice start to a special day because the place is nicely decorated and a bit fancy."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and the food was fantastic. Bonnie was an absolute gem and it was so nice that she complimented my hair (Lol) and my family. The whole place was alive with great music, happy people, and excellent food."}
{"text":"Excellent!
Just had the delicious Cubano with a secret spicy avocado sauce the waiter brought!

My wife had Christina' tamale benedicts and said they were terrific and my son had the Carne asada & Eggs, the meat was great!

Love to come whenever we can !"}
{"text":"Great service from friendly and entertaining Gino from New York Bronx, Loved the Food and Quick Service.  Music on Weekend - Awesome Bloody Mary Bar - would highly recommend this restaurant -"}
{"text":"Tried on a Sunday and couldn't get a seat - the place was packed with a 45 minute wait for table of 3. But Yelp reviews and the line up of people seemed promising so we went back the next day. 

Food was delicious - crab hash, salmon hash and carnitas hash, all shared and enjoyed. 
We also enjoyed the mimosa flight - guava, cranberry, orange and pineapple. 

Service was prompt, friendly and thoughtful. 

We agreed we'd go back to try other menu items if we're ever in town again."}
{"text":"Terrible hostess service and very unorganized. I really wish I could give a review of what looks like great food, but I wouldn't know seeing as the hostesses forgot about us after we had been waiting for a little more than an hour to eat. We arrived expecting 6 people to show up, but as soon as we knew there'd be less we let the hostesses know there'd be 4 instead. Our buzzer went off right as we went up to change it again to add one more and she said she'd reset it for us when they would have a bigger table available. We were very upfront and flexible as we knew the number of our group was being unpredictable against our will. We were very present and proactive about this. So you wouldn't think we'd be easily forgotten. So we sat and sat and sat. Soon we noticed that a large group who was there after us got seated outside. The tables were even pushed together for them. We were told that that wasn't possible. We brought that to the attention of both women and noticed that our name had already been crossed off and other large groups were put before us. The women proclaimed that they never said that we couldn't sit outside and that they would never say it to begin with. We received no apology and they never admitted a fault. We left right away and went and had fantastic crepes and French cuisine right across the parking lot instead. 
Also, don't expect to socialize comfortably with family etc as the music on Sunday mornings is obnoxiously loud and unnecessary. If that's your thing, then more power to you."}
{"text":"Sunday morning brunch, dancing with the owner, Bonnie, drinking Bloody Mary's, enjoying the largest Bloody Mary Bar, that I have ever seen in my life! This Bloody Bar has meatballs, boiled eggs, bacon, and so much MORE! Our waiter, CJ, was exceptionally awesome. The food is delicious! It's absolutely incredible! Love to dance, no matter what time it is! This restaurant is an awesome adventure! Cheers"}
{"text":"This is my third time here now and I can't get enough. The food, the drinks, the vibe, the weekend djs all 5 star. Best Bloody Mary cure hangover in the gainey ranch side. Definitely one of my favorite breakfast joints by far!"}
{"text":"Just came back to the Hash and had the herb chicken & waffles and the chorizo hash. 
The herb chicken & waffle is to die for! The fried leeks taste amazing covered in a great batter. The waffle has bacon in it. I would definitely order it again!!!

Previous review: 
Best breakfast I've had in Arizona! 
Love the decoration and ambiance. 

I especially enjoyed their corn beef hash! Would come again"}
{"text":"3.5 stars!

I miss all of the staff that I'd known for years.  Everyone who works here now, with the exception of perhaps two people, are new hires and will be moving to their respective Hash Kitchen locations once they've opened (Chandler and Phoenix).  I've decided to update my review, since I am not able to update any new photos (the link to add is, currently, permanently grey and won't let me post).

As regular HK patrons know, the menu usually has a few new items added.  I spotted \"Benedict Fries\" on my latest visit, so I decided to try it.  It's basically French fries with toppings of what you'd typically find in a Benedict: poached eggs, sliced ham, peppered bacon bits, and hollandaise sauce.  Delicious, and the poached eggs were the best eggs I've ever had that that weren't my mother's perfected scrambles!  I usually try to avoid eating as much egg whites as I can (I order a two-egg scramble prepared with one full egg and an extra egg yolk, for example), but I could eat these poached eggs in their entirety!  My only complaint was that these thin French fries were too soggy AND greasy for my liking.  

My all-time favorite Coconut-almond encrusted French toast are almost-always perfect, since someone in the kitchen knows just the way I like them prepared.  I will do my very best to follow him wherever he may land!  

Will return in a couple of days to try another new menu item!"}
{"text":"Ok. Gave weekend breakfast here a second try today, and I'll stick to weekday kitchen service from now on.  Ordered the Coconut-almond French toast the \"new\" way since Nov. 23rd's version https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=jmx43yTPwP6mUTdA2v_Z6w&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA was excellent (I usually request thinner slices), but the two whole slices of brioche in today's  version weren't sliced into triangles, so the pieces did not absorb enough of the delicious custard, PLUS the slices were burnt!  Not too much that I wanted them redone, but I definitely thought about asking!

I did meet someone interesting to talk to-  just struck up a conversation with Kelly, who sat next to me at the outdoor bar counter...

If dining alone, or with one or two people and don't mind sitting outdoors and at the bar, plan to arrive between 10 and 10:15 am.  Maybe I was lucky, but Kelly said Sunday is usually less hectic than Saturday, which was the day I took my out-of-town guests here this past spring and encountered more than an hour-long wait.  There was a long line of people waiting for tables at 10:40 am today.

Just an aside, Mom enjoyed the scramble version of the Dr. \"Art\" Mollen frittata. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=dNkk2sg6gWh22XvNyQVc_A&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  There was an upcharge of $2 for the goat cheese and $2.50 for a buttermilk pancake (replacing the included biscuit). https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=hN3lQfXGU5hWi4Mgva_FvQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA"}
{"text":"yummy!  the hostess has an amazing spirit.  the good was great!  the mimosa flight was the perfect compliment to the meal.  can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I am always trying new places to brunch! This is by far my favorite place!! Bonnie always greets you with a huge smile and great conversation! The food is AMAZING!!!! There smoked Salmon Hash and the French Toast is to die for!!! I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Had the Crab eggs Benedict and it was amazing! Very cool having a DJ while eating breakfast."}
{"text":"It was my second time here and enjoyed it just as much (if not more) as the first time here. A big difference was that my first time here was on a busy sunday morning... It is definitely worth the long wait and I must say the bloody mary bar helps quite a bit!!!! I brought a friend here on monday and she loved it. We enjoyed two bloody mary's, french toast and a breakfast sandwich. Our server was so nice and made us feel very welcomed from the moment we arrived. I'll definitely be back, cannot wait!"}
{"text":"First time in AZ and this was the first place we stopped to eat. Thank you YELP for the indirect recommendation. 

Man, I am from CA and this place felt like a club (not a bad thing). They had a huge island bar right when you step in. To the right, a full bar and some high tables. To the left, regular dining tables. The decor was like a family restaurant with amazing comfortable seats plus a pinch of modern fun. This is just the first impression ! 1030 AM and these Arizonians are getting their drink on! They even had a freaking live DJ! 

 The staff was extremely attentive and friendly. There was an older lady walking around chatting with everyone. She was probably the owner.

 The food was freaking delicious. I ordered a hash herb chicken and the wifey ordered carnitas hash. Delicious! They serve the food inside a mini cast iron pan. I couldn't finish it because the darn thing was stuffed of mini block potatoes. 

 They need one of these in the Bay! 

Side note, don't come here if you're looking for a calm, quiet date night with the significant other. You'll be screaming at each other asking simple questions like \"how was your day?\""}
{"text":"1) I love a good Bloody Mary bar and love that they have a virgin option 
2) mimosa flights? Smart!!
3) pancake flights? Genius !!
Really good quality and interesting smart unique options 
Atmosphere is loud but really energetic with a live DJ . Leaving full n happy"}
{"text":"Definitely had mimosa and Bloody Mary envy during our short time here, but we opted out of the alcoholic beverages since we were going to have a long day that would surely involve more drinking later on. We ordered a couple hashes that were nicely portioned and well-balanced in both textures and flavors. Service was great too. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food, atmosphere, and the Sunday Bloody Mary bar is to die for!"}
{"text":"Brunch Heaven!! Best Breakfast I have had in like ( Ever)!! Love the music, staff, food and most of all the Bloody Mary Bar!!
Definitely a must experience a foodie should try!!
I had the steak and eggs and it was so good and the portion was huge I even shared!! 
P.S
The brunch bruschetta is such a great concept and tasted delicious. Definitely in my plans to return!!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for Mother's Day.  Got there a few minutes early, and the hostess said the wait (despite the reservation) would be at least 30 min.  Won't be back!!"}
{"text":"I am very impressed with this concept! The food and bloody mary's are just as good as the ambiance. 
I had the breakfast burrito. It was well seasoned and very tasty. My wife loved her crab salad. 
You can literally get full with their bloodies! 
The only problem I had was my stomach wasn't big enough to drink another one:( 

We are going back this Saturday!

Update:
I forgot to mention their bad A$$ DJ. He spun some old school rap I had forgotten about! Nice job!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of Hash Kitchen but was looking for a place to meet my parent for brunch near their hotel and Yelp helped me stumble upon Hash. The search feature indicated they offered a dog friendly patio, I called to confirm and they did. They mentioned they do not take reservations for under 10 people but the space is good sized and they have three different patios as well. We were seated immediately and greeted by a friendly waitress. She was able to offer some suggestions on our orders and we decided to go with the Carnitas hash (one of the best sellers according to her), the berry waffle, and the chicken and waffle. My husband enjoyed his carnitas, I tried the meat and it was delicious. He mentioned that there were a lot of different flavors that were used in the dish, which almost made it indistinguishable. He mentioned that a hot sauce or more salsa could have enhanced the dish. My mom devoured her berry waffle and highly recommended them. My dad and I both enjoyed the chicken and waffles, you get a little surprise of bacon in the dish. There were a lot of shoe string style onion rings, which were good but perhaps could be fewer. The chicken was white meat, had a good glaze on it and the waffle was delicious. The average meal is around $14 but the portions were pretty decent. If you are looking for something more upscale for brunch, I would recommend Hash Kitchen for sure!"}
{"text":"Very cool. Creative and tasty. Great experience. A little noisy because of customers raving about their food and the ambiance."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place . If you a very hungry because plates are huge and they do not offer 1/2 orders to bad"}
{"text":"Had Sunday brunch. Great vibe.  Tasty food.  Friendly staff.  Will go again."}
{"text":"The food was salty, there was a bug on our table, and the salmon skillet was cooked, not raw like you would think \"lox\". 

The mimosa flight was good but pricey.

Service was good :)"}
{"text":"Most amazing time with my girls! Great Bloody Mary Bar! Great Mimosa Flight! Every dish was perfect! Bonnie was the cherry on top with her dancing and smile! She even ran out of the restaurant to chase me down after I left my hat on the seat! Love her! Omg and the DJ!!!! He played me and my girls some Neyo and we danced our brunch away! Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for breakfast. Great service. Friendly atmosphere. Bloody Mary Bar is a must. I'm not a Bloody Mary drinker, but well worth the experience. The Lump Crab and Sweet Potato Hash was tasty as was the build your own Frittata  Try salmon, artichokes with mushrooms."}
{"text":"Great girls lunch! Food was amazing and service was even better. Thanks Justin and Hash Kitchen staff!"}
{"text":"Our 1st visit here and totally loved it! The service was great, fast, and the food was amazing. Ingredients were fresh and the RUMCHATA iced coffee was soooo perfect for brunch. The Bloody Mary bar was way beyond my expectations and kept the flow moving: it was kinda like watching kids in a candy store, all the adults were having a great time! It was a nice, refreshing atmosphere. Music playing in the background, but not so loud that you could barely have a conversation. The manager even greeted us, asking about our experience and wished us well. It was overall a great experience and I look forward to coming back here time and time again."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with The Hash Kitchen!! Great atmosphere, phenomenal service and amazing Bloody Mary bar."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast. The food is awesome and the staff is wonderful. Really glad we found this place! Service was quick and prices are what you would expect in Scottsdale, however pretty reasonable. We will definitely be stopping in here again for breakfast"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good. Food was above average and service was friendly. I'm very picky about my breakfast but this was pretty good but not excellent. The lady in the front Calls everyone \"young lady\" or \"young man\" so that was a little uncomfortable, but whatever she's old so I'm not holding it against anyone. Definitely worth a visit if you love trying new breakfast places. :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in the valley! I'm gluten intolerant and I always have plenty of options to choose from plus they don't make me feel weird when I order gluten free like I've experienced with other places. Gino was our server and he was great! Very attentive and nice.  Turns out he's from the same neighborhood my boyfriend (who was in town visiting) lives in so they had a great connection and hit it off quickly. My gluten free waffle was amazing and had great texture and when I ordered a side of bacon extra crispy it actually came out crispy which I appreciate lol all in all it was a great visit and we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I've never been here but my parents come here often. I ordered the green Chile hash, this was so good!!! It's diced potatoes on the bottom of a skillet with green Chile sweet corn cotija cheese and topped with over medium eggs... I loved it!! My parents food looked delicious and I did try the sweet biscuit that was delicious as well. The waitress we had was super friendly and checked on us frequently. I believe it was the restaurant manager or owner he came by as well to see if we were enjoying everything which I thought was really cool. Restrooms were nice and clean, the restaurant in general is open clean with a pretty cool decor. Prices are a little higher than some other places but the portions and food is well worth it, I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great place love the fresh pancakes and the different flavors they have to offer the service is top notch."}
{"text":"Fun vibe, but hit or miss.  First time loved our food and incredible service.  Went back with out of town guests and was greeted by grumpy man at host desk who needs training in customer service skills!  He sat us and poured water and acted as though it was the last place he wanted to be.  The French toast was amazing so gave it another shot.  Unfortunately, frittatas and breakfast burritos were very dry, would not order again.  I had the chorizo hash first visit that was excellent along with amazing pancakes."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I've been twice with different friends and the food is always really good. I've had the Bloody Mary, berry mimosa, fried chicken hash and the carne asada hash.  I'd recommend them all! Next time I go I'm planning on trying the lump crab and sweet potato hash. The place is pretty unique and has a great vibe. 

The only issue I've ever had is being seated. The first time it was an hour wait but for 20 minutes+ the table next to us was open and it seemed like no one else was waiting. The manager ended up seating us there and profusely apologized that we hadn't been sat sooner. He even gave us a drink on the house for the wait which was pretty nice since we had said anything. All in all still a great place and worth your time and money. You'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and ordered something different each time, all of which were super disappointing and left me hungry. I love the atmosphere of this place, it's a cool spot and really close to where I live but the food sucks. They really need to work on the menu."}
{"text":"The bartenders were absolutely amazing. Great drinks. Do NOT order the breakfast lasagna. Odd, I get it. But wasn't good at all. What's worse? The manager argues with you when you don't like something. What did I do to him? Probably shouldn't argue with customers and then storm over to the computer and slam some buttons to take an item off my bill that I didn't care to have taken off."}
{"text":"In town for my best friends birthday and stopped here for brunch. Can we say DELICIOUS?! I ordered the cinnamon roll pancakes, applewood smoked bacon and a side of scrambled eggs. The pancakes weren't too sweet especially for being so early in the day and the bacon was REAL Bacon thickness. But the best part has to be the Flight Mimosas - 4 flavored mimosas to get the party started! Our server was very nice and for a group of 11 we got our food pretty quickly. Will definitely be back if we come back to the city."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Didn't get the bartender's name. Little blondie took forever to take our order. Didn't ask us once how our food was (which wasn't good). Just walked by and muttered \"you good?\" Lol WHAT. Don't know who crapped in her coffee but she ruined my experience. Food was subpar. Both our entrees were mediocre. My boyfriends food was a pile of shit on top of some soggy chips. Definitely never going back tho."}
{"text":"I was wowed at the beautiful restaurant and the service! The waitress was extremely friendly and looked as if she enjoyed working there. 

I loved how the the booster seat came with a new slip cover so that my child doesn't get other kids germs. I've never had a restaurant provide that before. 

Now the food: it was absolutely amazing. The food is very inventive and with the best flavor! 

When I'm back in Arizona, I'll be sure to make a stop here!"}
{"text":"Coolest breakfast spot for a morning after date or for a great start of your day with the wife. Best Bloody Mary's and very cool adult coffee drinks. Breakfast came out fast and service for awesome. This place is a definite Must Try!!"}
{"text":"Hash Kitchen is my new favorite brunch spot the food is amazing and don't even get me started on the drinks!  I took my boyfriends parents while they were in town from Utah & they were so impressed they have demanded it every visit since!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food was awesome - I had chicken and waffles. The server was kind enough to add an extra syrup to my order, telling me that I'd want it. He was right. The Bloody Mary was off the hook and the live DJ made my morning perfect. They are opening up other locations and one is coming to my neighborhood this year...and I can't wait."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, generous portions and excellent service! Our food came out so fast and we all loved what we got. We weren't expecting the DJ but it turned out to be really fun!  I ordered the Huevos Ranchero Hash and it was seriously so delicious.  The fried onions weren't listed on the menu so they ended up being the best surprise and probably my favorite part of the dish.  

P.S. This place gets BUSY but it's so big that the wait goes by incredibly fast."}
{"text":"Went here again on Sunday for brunch. Was not disappointed. The reason I originally gave it 4/5 stars was because the music was a little clubby and loud for my taste. However, this time they were jammin' the reggae and it was not nearly as loud. Well done!"}
{"text":"There is a lot to like about The Hash Kitchen. The only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars is the \"music\" that was playing during Sunday brunch. It was loud and intrusive, and made conversation difficult. 

Food and service are great, and the Bloody Mary bar is a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service!  Highly recommend!!!  Justin was great and even recommended great dishes.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"The owners are the same owners as Tomaso's (Family owned Italian restaurant in the Valley for 37 years). 
We had Crab Benedict and Crab Sweet Potato Hash ($15). Both were wonderful!  Saw lots of creative dishes---skillets, belgian waffle piled high-- come out of the kitchen.
I would definitely go there again to try the French Press Coffee ($6.50) and the build your own Bloody Mary Bar ($10) !"}
{"text":"It's ok...nothing special....I have had much better for a less price.  Plus the music on a Sunday was so LOUD--I prefer my loud music at the local night club not  Sunday dining.  Chances are we will not go back."}
{"text":"I come here with my family all the time! Perfect brunch place with endless options- savory or sweet! The decor is beautiful and the servers were fast. I ordered the steak skillet and it was delicious."}
{"text":"My all-time favorite place to hang out at. Let's take it from the top, planned a bachelorette party and scoped out different places before I took some friends to this little gem. I have been to the one in Scottsdale, but accidentally stumbled to this location (Both places are AH-MAH-ZING!!).  So made a reservation for about 16 peeps to this location in Frank Lloyd Wright, once I checked in Kaitlyn at the front (sweet adorable girl, with a wonderful smile), then decided to head to the bar To  visit Weston (me makes some mean drinks and has the most beautiful eyes). Diane and Linda were very accommodating and took care of us before our group came in. If you want to know about a thing or two at this place, ask these two wonderful ladies. Jesus was our server, and so awesome. If you get a chance - tell him ALOHA and ask about the time a bunch of ladies danced hula there. 

That was the amazing part, the future bride and a bunch of us gals had the opportunity to dance a hula number for random people and boy did we love sharing the ALOHA!! And to the DJ- you are the man. Thank you so much.  
This place is so wonderful and great, I want everyone To know how amazing the service is, followed by the fantastic food and drinks. Aloha and Thank YOU!!"}
{"text":"Amazing way to start a Sunday! Great vibes with the music. Garage doors up with the football games on. The food was absolutely delicious and our server Jesus was the man. He was very polite, always asking what more he could do for us. He made suggestions and brought us a killer fruit and donut board to start. With my Packers winning it was a perfect lunch! A-Plus all the way around thanks Hash. We will definitely be coming back soon and often!"}
{"text":"GO TO THIS PLACE!  

My hats off to Joey, the creator of this much needed new breakfast lunch place in central Scottsdale. The menu is unique, simple to understand and lots of great choices. The ambience is relaxing and the place jams with energy vibrating from the ground to the walls and hopefully through to the customers!

I have the Salmon Eggs Benedict.  EXCELLENT!  My date has some egg dish, which I can't recall the name of it, but they said it was awesome as well.  The French coffee was amazingly good too."}
{"text":"Awesome bloody mar bar, super extensive with hundreds of options. Bacon, slim jims, all sorts of shellfish and pickled veggies.... 
I had the chicken and waffles that feature bacon in the waffle, eggs, and fried leeks. Awesome. 
The hashes and chilaquiles at the table were excellent as well."}
{"text":"The worst smoked salmon Benedict I have ever eaten. Two peaces of grilled not smoked fish the demotion 1-1/2\" by 1-1/2\" by3/4\" not ever liquid smoke. Definitely not worth the money!"}
{"text":"I want to start off my review by saying Hash messed up my order. I know you're thinking but you gave them 5 stars. Yes I did because of their EXCELLENT customer service. The manager fixed my order so quickly and offered to provide me other menu items while I waited. 

Now from the beginning. I'm here on business and my husband and I haven't been lucky with the restaurants in Scottsdale. I went to Hash because it was fairly close to my hotel and the food looked delicious. Our wait was between 45min and one hour which I expected because it's Mother's Day. 

We were seated an hour later outside and it was great. We started with the mimosa flight and OMG yes, yes, yes they were AWESOME SAUCE!!! I asked the waiter for non pork recommendations and she provided a few. I ordered the chicken and waffles and my husband had the steak and eggs. 

Our meals arrived and the presentation was great. I dive right into my food and notice some little pieces of meat in my waffle. I have my husband look and yep it's bacon in the waffle mix! Well I tell the waiter and she had the kitchen prepare another meal. No big deal. Well the replacement arrived with a new waffle but the same chicken. I sent it back again because I can't have the chicken because it was on top of the bacon waffle. By now the manager walked by and obviously could see my disappointment. I explained to him I don't eat pork due to religion and before I could finish he said ma'am you don't have to explain I'm going to remake your entire meal. At first I declined and he said no I'm going to get it right. 

This is why I will be visiting Hash again. The way he handled the situation is how a customer wants to be treated. Also, my meal was complimentary. I completely devoured the chicken and waffles. It was really good. 

Plus, they passed out chocolate covered strawberries to all the moms. Although I'm not a mom they gave me one and the gentleman stated well you have a mom. This small gesture meant a lot since 5/13/18 was my mother's 2nd year being gone after loosing her battle to cancer. Thank you Hash!"}
{"text":"I had never been to this restaurant before and am a huge breakfast food enthusiast. The cocktails were awesome especially if you have an affinity towards coco-puffs. Bonnie is a pleasure to talk to and adds to a fun environment with great music. There's also a beautiful bartender named Katie, who makes the possibly long wait not so bad. Definitely check the place out."}
{"text":"So, there are a few good and bad things about this place.

Pros: 
-Thethe bloody Mary bar is legit. Had lots of toppings. 
-The presentation of the food looks really good.

Cons:
-The the food taste was, ok at best. We had 8 people, and 1 person said it was great, 1 said it was good, 1 said it was bad, 5 said it was OK.
-Wait time longer than normal breakfast places.
-Slightly high price for breakfast

We also waited 1 hour 10 minutes when they said it would be 25-30 min wait. This was on Sunday July 31 around 11 ish.

A couple things we ordered weren't as described in the menu, but not a huge deal. 

I had the steak eggs Benedict, the steak was good, flavor of the rest was ok, and the eggs were not runny, yolk was hard. 

So overall, this place has great potential!!  But for the price and wait and expectation, not there yet. One day when it gets better we'll return."}
{"text":"The customer service was excellent. The location is excellent.  However, the breakfast had minimal to no flavor and I had to add lots of salt and pepper.  I usually don't find myself having to season food at all when I go out."}
{"text":"AMAZING BRUNCH. Love the love music on weekends but the service and food is much better on weekdays. The beef is creek stone and they have awesome burgers and carnitas"}
{"text":"Food - 5/5 Stars - I had the Lump Crab Eggs Benedict & the Nutella & Banana French toast. Hands down THE BEST EGGS BENNY I've had in a long time! French Toast was just decadent! Oh, & the nectur of the Gods they serve with it (home made maple syrup) is something straight from heaven. Our meal was pretty much perfect!

Service - 5/5 Stars - Wait staff was attentive & worked well together. We didn't have to hardly ask for anything. They were on it! Ask for Jesus, he was great. Very knowledgeable and friendly. 
 
Ambiance - 5 / 5 Stars - Awesome! Witty sayings & quotes on the wall (in a chalk mural style)! Love it! Bloody Mary Bar was a nice touch, too!

Value - 5 / 5 Stars - Inexpensive for the whole family. 

Overall 5 Stars


Will I be back? Yes
Would I recommend to a friend? Yes"}
{"text":"Love this place! Bloody Mary bar is fantastic and my favorite. So many great items on the menu, I wanted to eat everything ."}
{"text":"Italian family owned and operated, each location has lovely Italian women seating, managing and making sure everything is going smoothly and everyone is having a great time.

This kitchen is one of my favorite \"go to\" restaurants when I'm craving great affordable food with a nice atmosphere. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast spot in Scottsdale!!  Great breakfast entree's and the make awesome Bloody Mary's!!!   I had chicken and waffles it was great.  Service was very good for or table of seven.   This will be a place we visit every time we come home!!"}
{"text":"This place is a rip off. We weren't greeted at all when we came in. They're hostesses greeted us with cellphones. Nobody even said hello. We sat at the bar where we still didn't even greet us. About 15 minutes and finally someone said something. Nobody smiles in this place. Seemed to be very out of order and chaotic to work here. 
Seems like the staff doesn't enjoy they're job either. Definitely don't see myself coming back far better Bloody Mary bars that aren't an entire joke or rip off in Scottsdale. I wasn't going to write a review until when i asked the bartender if she could give us split checks since my meal was more expensive. She basically told us to do the math ourselves until another bartender helped us out. Sorry but When you ring orders in don't you separate seats? Can't believe we spent that amount and still had such awful service. It would have been nice to at least get a smile from someone"}
{"text":"We don't have this kitchen on my side of town (yet) so it was nice to finally try it out while passing through the area. I tried the steak & egg breakfast burrito & my bf got French toast eggs & sausage. Huge portions very delicious. I was surprised at how good my burrito was. I tried the French toast and holy hell it was so so delicious. The restaurant is very spacious & clean. I hope we get a location near arrowhead soon."}
{"text":"The most fun I have ever had a breakfast place.  The atmosphere was vibrant and happy and the staff were cheerful and energetic.  The build your own Bloody Mary Bar is enough reason to visit but the food is dynamite.  We couldn't decided if the Nutella and banana French Toast, red velvet pancakes or brisket hash was the best at our table.  Our son has two severe food allergies and our server and the owner went out of their way to be sure that it was safe for him to eat.  They brought the ingredient list out to show me!  You rarely get restaurants to understand how important a food allergy is and never get that kind of service.  The customer service is the best we have experienced.  I see why the place is so busy.  Great prices for families!"}
{"text":"Best brunch to date in Scottsdale. Good drinks but not the place to go if your looking for unlimited drinks. We just wanted one and we're so happy with our meal. Great drinks, great food!!"}
{"text":"This place was such an amazing place to have me and my girlfriend bday brunch. Bonnie was such a pleasure she was so lively and fun. The host were so sweet and amazing. Will definitely be back to visit. Great mimosa and Dj !!!!"}
{"text":"If nothing else, get yourself one of the Build Your Own Bloody Mary's. It's customizable with their house infused flavored vodkas, regular, medium, or hot tomato juice, and all the different add-ons (read: bacon, slim jims, stuffed olives, and ohemgee fried raviolis). The wait for a table is long, definitely not the 25 minutes we were promised, but their bloody mary definitely made it a little more tolerable.

To be honest, the wait, insane crowd, and mediocre service largely attributed to this average rating. People were cutting lines left and right, be it trying to get your name in to get a table, or getting yourself a bloody mary, customers often were oblivious or deliberately ignoring the lines the rest of us had formed and the wait staff did nothing to provide service to the people who had been patiently waiting in line. That in itself was my first disappointment.

At the table, I'll cut my waiter some slack since the restaurant was basically at the point of chaos. We got the huevos rancheros hash, which was delish, but the apple pie pancakes were just okay. It was a stack of four plain pancakes with apple pie fillings and crumbs on the top. However, the bottom three pancakes were pretty dry and I found my little cup of syrup empty in no time at all. I do really appreciate that our waiter noticed this and offered to bring more syrup, though unfortunately, I was basically done at this point.

All in all, decent experience but I'm in no hurry to stop by for a weekend brunch since the crowd is just off-putting."}
{"text":"When there is a dj, Bloody Mary bar, and fruity pebble popsicles you know it's going to be an amazing brunch! The lemon ricotta pancakes are amazing! I'll be back tomorrow to try more"}
{"text":"Hash kitchen is an amazing gem in Scottsdale! I've never had French toast quite this delicious! They have a variety of options for French toast but we chose the s'mores! It was perfection! The graham crackers and dusted on top on a marshmallow puff drizzled in Nutella and accompanied by butter and maple syrup. We had to get one hash fish, after all we came to Hash kitchen. We got the huevos hash! It was just the right balance of savory and sweet we needed with our two plates! I can't end my review without advising you to get a blood Mary at your BYOBM bar! They have a variety of options for your Bloody Mary with 40 toppings you can add to customize your own bloody! We are stuffed and happy and can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"New place not many customers. Way over priced. If you drink alcohol they have a 'bloody Mary 'bar. Without alcohol way over priced FYI"}
{"text":"Three stars for the food, four stars for the DIY Bloody Mary bar. The food only gets three because it's just OK, nothing special. It's called Hash Kitchen, but the hash is mediocre. I would still recommend it, and will be going back."}
{"text":"The family and I had breakfast here for Father's Day and the place was very busy but they did a great job keeping the wait nice and short! The food was amazing! Highly recommend the cereal cocktails! Sweet and unique! We were lucky to have Patrick as our server! He was very accommodating and has an excellent memory! Wonderful way to celebrate my father on his special day!"}
{"text":"Best brunch ever ... found by chance ... just moved to Scottsdale .. love the mimosa flight !!!
Bonnie the hostess makes you feel like you have know her for years. Excellent service and excellent food"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Bonnie is an amazing individual that brings such happiness to the building. Will definitely come back, in love!"}
{"text":"Absolutely in LOVE with the Bloody Mary Bar. Honestly, I could make a meal out of this drink. I loved the infused vodka and the level of their spicy Bloody Mary mix. It was on point. And trust me, i know bloody Mary's. Years of experience speaking here...

Their Bloody Mary bar has such variety and the items were absolutely stop notch. I loved the bacon,
The beef jerky, the oyster on the half shell... I can go on and on. I assume their sister restaurant is next door, Hoggs and Hopps. Cuz the smoked meats and the bacon were absolutely delicious. 

They had a DJ during brunch on Sunday, who wrapped up around 1pm.

We got the nutella donuts, I got the herb chicken hash and hubs got the pulled pork waffles. I am sad to say, while good, the meals itself was not very flavorful. 

The service was great except out waitress seemed to forget a lot of our requests and was a bit lack luster. But she was very sweet.

Next time I will just have two bloody Mary's and be a very happy bruncher :) I highly recommend you try this!"}
{"text":"Just went in for the first time!  Music is way too loud and the hostess stand is totally clueless.  There were 7 empty tables on the patio during our 25 minute wait, and we said we WANTED an outside table.  She claimed they were for reservations, but in the 25 minutes, no one ever came and she ended up seating us at the empty table we stared at the whole time.  Then the waitress was completely unfriendly once she heard us say we did not want a breakfast cocktail.  She literally just walked away, said nothing and came back with water.  We asked questions about the menu and she shrugged and gave one word answers.  When we did a build your own option she was annoyed with the brief debate over which ingredients.  The food did come fast and the biscuits are delicious.  The food was good, but the poor service convinced me there are enough other breakfast spots to go with good service!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! And the service was incredible, everyone was so nice and made us feel welcomed"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place the food is delicious every time, but I've been there 3 times and the service is poor. 

The first time we went, our server didn't smile once and was probably seen three times the whole meal. She wasn't even the one who dropped the check to us. 

The second time we had the same person and wasn't much different.

We went this morning and wasn't greeted for 18 minutes. I know that because I texted my mom to tell her I would text her later because I was at brunch. No one greeted us, everyone just kept walking past us. A guest noticed we weren't helped before a server did. After about 15 minutes we were offered drinks by a different server, so we order waters and a Bloody Mary. Finally the actual server noticed that we were his table and apologized for the wait. By this time we were done with our drinks, ready for another one and knew our orders for food. We ordered it all because we weren't sure when we'd see him again. 

It took about 15 minutes for our new drinks and food to come. The food was delicious but the second blood Mary's were not, my roommate and I couldn't even finish them. I'm not sure if the original server and our server rang in different ones but we didn't like the second ones at all.

No one came over to check how we were doing, we would have said something if someone asked. 

Like I said, I really really want to like this place but I've yet to have a positive service experience. I hope others are having better luck, and we're just gone during poor times. :("}
{"text":"One of the best all around breakfasts we've ever experienced. From the upmost quality of food to even better service from all the staff. 
Hands down the most amazing chicken and waffles in Scottsdale! That is of course followed by the amazing Bloody Mary bar.
Would recommend anyone go here that is looking to have a great meal along with amazing service."}
{"text":"it's  sunday....

you are in a fantastic area of scottsdale..
the dj and music is utterly disgusting..diabolical..
it's hard to believe such an establishment allows this!!
maybe you should serve earplugs with your menu's..
let's cater to your local crowd..."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff, AMAZING food! The best breakfast restaurant I've ever been too! The bloody Mary bar is To. Die. For."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! While you're waiting for your table you can grab a drink at the full service Bloody Mary bar. The bartender mixes your drink base and you can add your own fixings to your drink. So many options and so yummy. Best Bloody Mary I've had! Really unique place! Overall great service and food."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us from our server from their sister restaurant the Sicilian Butcher which is also jammin. Our server today Jen was awesome ! The best. 

The place aesthetically was very pleasing very crisp and clean. The bathrooms were immaculate and not to mention the food was fantastic. I had the huevos rancheros which was giant and delicious. The kids had the Oreo pancakes not too sweet.  Jen even gave us coffee to go without asking. Were from California and would definitely recommend it and come back. 

HASH HASH BABY you rock!"}
{"text":"Definitely my go to spot for Brunch with my girls. The service is top notch and the food is amazing. The high light of it all is their Bloody Mary bar. Thank you Bonnie, Evan, Lona and Alyssa for making me feel welcomed and appreciated. I'll see you next week!"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch. Loved the lump crab hash. Carnita hash was delicous as well. Biscuits with jam was good as well. For mimosa flight the guava and original are the best ones. Only negative is the mimosa had more juice than sparkling wine/champagne. The day we went they had a live DJ with loud music. It would have been nice to have different type of music."}
{"text":"Came here during the week for breakfast with my sisters. I'd heard good things about this place.
I was a little disappointed. I ordered biscuits and gravy. The portion was HUGE. My sister had ordered the same thing and I wish the waitress would have told us how big it was. We could have easily split and still had leftovers. The biscuits were dry also. It was way over priced. About $20 after tax and tip for the 2 dry biscuits plus gravy I had. Wow, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great Bloody Mary bar, we had the veggie frittata which my wife said was really good. I had the chicken eggs Benedict, eggs we're poached too hard and meal was very dry .My daughter had  the biscuits and gravy with eggs over medium and eggs were way over cooked. Menu looks great. Chef needs to pay attention to the basics"}
{"text":"Very friendly place that was super clean and well decorated.  They are a lot of things on the menu that we wanted to try.  We were able to sit down, order and eat in a reasonable amount of time on a weekday morning.  Their croque madame was delicious.  The mexicana scrambler was also good.  The portions are very large though!  Would love to try their bloody mary bar on a weekend."}
{"text":"Reasons why The Hash Kitchen is better than yo momma's kitchen...

1. The service is amazing. Food was fast and fresh and we were checked on often. I dig that 

2. I've been here on multiple occasions -- in fact it's where I take all my friends/family that visit from out of town to -- the food has yet to disappoint. They even change the menu up seasonally to give us other yummy options.

3. The Bloody Mary bar is too legit to quit. One time (picture not included) I had the yummiest hush puppies ever!! 

Overall great food - great service!!! You can't go wrong here!!!

((Adrian one of the managers that stopped by to check on us hooked us up with the Cannoli Donuts for dessert (pictured) 3 words....BOMB-DOT-COM ))"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Hash Kitchen but my experience and meal did not meet my expectations. The wait was forever long and it seemed like the hostesses did not have a proper way of tracking the reservations - as it looked like they had multiple pieces of paper and they didn't know one paper from the other in terms of order. I had the breakfast sandwich with bacon. It came out cold and was just meh. It was definitely not worth the 1 hour+ wait. If you are looking for a breakfast with that long of a wait I would suggest going somewhere else. Also, seemed like it was more of a drinking spot with the bloody mary bar setup in the center of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I am the CEO of Snooze Eatery (a breakfast place) and had the pleasure of eating at The Hash Kitchen this morning. You have to give credit where credit is due and the Hash Kitchen is awesome. The atmosphere is upscale and vibrant - a great way to start the day. The staff was incredible, from being greeted the moment we walked in the door to the moment we left. And the food - first rate in every way. The menu is diverse and the quality is through the roof. Congratulations to Hash Kitchen!"}
{"text":"This is a rare restaurant in the breakfast scene. Unlike most American breakfast places, here the food is actually tasty and not standard. Add to this that they have a mimosa bar for the people who like it and great modern music and/or a DJ at times, this makes this my favorite breakfast place. To add on this their service is awesome and the decor of the place is super beautiful and pleasing. 

What is even better is that they are adding locations and there is now just a walking distance from my home. 

The only problem is that like most successful breakfast places the wait time might be long although when I came to this new location on a weekday early morning there was no line at all."}
{"text":"Came here without a reservation knowing it was packed and was told it would be 45 minutes before being seated, but got seated around 20 minutes. During our wait, they had seats outside with fruit infused water. My boyfriend went straight to the DIY Bloody Mary bar and gave their famous drink a try. There were 40+ toppings for your bloody mary, with most being pickled things. You also get a selection of vodka flavors that they give you samples of if you're interested in before purchasing your $13 bloody mary (includes tips & tax). 

When we got seated and got water right away. Our waiter, Jesus, was super friendly and helped us with our choices and questions. My boyfriend and I were debating between the cannoli donuts or the bruschetta starters, but Jesus suggested the Hash Monkey, which was super well known. It tasted like something from Cinnabon, but the bread texture was super soft and easy to eat. Our waiter was nice enough to give us one complimentary cannoli donut so we could try because we couldn't decide on which starter. As for the rest of the meal, I went with the fried chicken benedict and my boyfriend had the lump crab sweet potato dish. The fried chicken was not dry; quite juicy with the fried onions and poached eggs on top. Loved the chopped up potatoes as well! My boyfriend's dish was more on the sweet side, due to the sweet potato hash. The crab was tasty with the egg on top as well. They also have a dj in the room to make the place more lively. We would definitely return to try other dishes on the menu and give our waiter, Jesus 5 stars for service!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Awesome food,  fantastic drinks and exceptionally attentive and fun waitstaff. I just wish it was open 24hours!!! Who doesn't love breakfast any time of the day? Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My second time here and loved as much as the first time.  Thank you so much Pam and Bonnie for making my group feel at home.  Came with a group of friends to celebrate my daughter moving back to IL. Thank you to the Hash Kitchen staff for a great time!!!!"}
{"text":"So glad someone told me about this place!  As soon as I saw the patio seating  I was jazzed and ready for a great time.  I loved the bright, open decor.  The bright red wall and the wall art with coffee cups was really cool.  It was Saturday, but we beat the rush.  The menu is quite extensive, and don't come here if you want a small plate!  The hash platters are huge.  My friend had one that was stacked high.  The bacon with sugar is addictive.  The service was outstanding.  Diane runs a tight ship and was on top of everything.  Our waiter was fun, attentive and cute (can't remember his name)-sorry.  The service was not rushed, just perfect.  The Bloody Mary bar is something to see and the mimosas are yummy, mango, blueberry, you name it.  The whole experience was wonderful."}
{"text":"This place is alright.  Nothing special besides their bloody marry bar.  Wasn't treated when walked in so we just seated ourselves at the bar.  Bar tender got our order, water and that was the last time we had conversation until we had to call her over for our bill.  Glad the manager came over to see how we were doing so I could get ketchup and hot sauce.  I almost took a picture of their employees.  4-5 of them standing in the corner talking with each other doing nothing.  Manager had to go over and tell them on two different occasions what they should be doing.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"The Bloody Mary bar is reason enough to come here. Jesus, our server, was wonderful. Super attentive, very patient when half our party was late. He even sang happy birthday to me and brought out a dessert. 

It was a great birthday breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I checked this place out after a neighbor raved about it. It was clean, open, and had a very unique menu! I'm still a fan of butterfields as my #1 breakfast place, but this place is great to try and check out!"}
{"text":"I went to The Hash Kitchen a few weeks ago and will be returning! The restaurant is very cute; open, bright and airy.. The service was friendly and fast. I tried the crab benedict, it was okay, but I thought the combination of flavors and texture didn't work for me. My friends got the chicken and waffles and the fried chicken benedict, both were really yummy!!! We also tried the cannoli donuts, those were freaking awesome! I would love to go back and try more of their food!"}
{"text":"Turn tables and Mimosas. This place is amazing. Such a clean fresh vibe. The food is unique and super tasty. My favorites are the crispy chicken tacos with the waffle cone like tortilla and the hash Eggs Benedict. Service is top notch. Just a great vibe here and something different than the usual breakfast fare. Lots more I want to try. Thanks for the great work Hash Kitchen."}
{"text":"The Hash Kitchen is hands down the best brunch spot in Scottsdale! While visiting this hot spot you must see Caleb at the bar and have him make you a drink, he's phenomenal at making the perfect Bloody Mary! The food here is absolutely delicious with a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to spend much time on this review because the problem was simple - the food was not even average for breakfast fare.

We had a couple of the hashes -- corned beef, and brisket with corn bread.  Both consisted of an inconvenient skillet with simple hash potatoes on the bottom.  This was topped with the meat, followed by our eggs.  There was little flavor in the potatoes (except grease), and our scrambled eggs were very overcooked and dry.

Worst were the meats.  These are not chopped into the hash but rather served on top of the potatoes.  The corned beef had a strange flavor that I find hard to describe.  The brisket was very thickly cut, extremely dry, and virtually tasteless (no smoke flavor at all).

On the good side, the biscuit and jam were good."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant. Good vibe and good people. Check this place out and Ms. Bonnie! It's amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review. I wasn't expecting the owner to reach out to me after I wrote my review but he did and I want to thank him for that. 

I gave this place another try and ordered their donuts, chicken and waffles, Popsicle and lump crab Benedict.

The donuts were delicious and not too sweet! It had cannoli cream in the center with bite siZe chocolate chips and some orange zest mixed into it. The donuts weren't oily and were very soft with the outer part being a tad bit crispy! Each order comes with three donuts! 

I ordered the chicken and waffles again and this time they made it correctly. The fried leeks on top of the chicken were lightly fried and had a sweet taste to it! It was amazing! Perfect combination with the chicken and waffles. 

The lump crab Benedict had real crab on it and the homemade biscuits were absolutely delicious. The biscuits were soft and fluffy and the eggs were poached  just right. 

Last but not least I ate their Popsicles for dessert. The Greek yogurt was light and didn't have that bitter taste to it. There were bananas, fruity pebbles and I believe strawberries in these Popsicle. Each order comes with two! 

Everything was absolutely delicious! I was very satisfied with the service and also the food. I will definitely come back :) thanks again Joey."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and great service! Yasssss! Great place to take your family and hang out."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Definitely check it out. Amazing Bloody Mary Bar. They infuse their own vodkas! Smoked salmon Benedict is incredible and you can make your own scrambled'"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the service. The restaurant refers to themselves as a creative breakfast experience, so with this in mind while ordering, I told my waiter I was vegan and asked for his recommendation. He responded \"oh you're SOL, you'll have to sit and watch everyone eat. Our kitchen is all animal products.\" Thinking he was maybe joking and knowing I saw a fruit platter, oatmeal, and many veggies on the menu, I responded \"so there's nothing I can eat?\" He then replied that he can do grilled veggies. Very, very disappointed in the lack of thoughtfulness by our waiter. I ended up ordering potatoes with pico de gallo, avocado, and a side of fruit. The potatoes were fine, nothing better than your average breakfast spot. The side of fruit was weak-grapes, pineapple, and cantaloupe. 

My food was fine, it filled me up but was nothing I would return for. The other guests in my party (non vegan) were very pleased with their meals, but agreed that our waiter was very rude and off-putting about my vegan request.

A few other negatives: there was a bug crawling around in our centerpiece, it was no big deal I just didn't want it on my table. I took the small centerpiece outside just to release the bug and two different individuals walked up to me in a panic as if I was stealing their cheesy centerpiece. I explained the bug situation and they allowed me to get rid of the bug, with no apology for a bug inside their restaurant... Then, there was an older lady (apparently the hostess) walking around shaking maracas. She appeared to be having a great time which was fun, and I'm sure the later day/drinking crowd might enjoy that, but mostly it was just odd for a breakfast... did not add to my experience. Others around didn't seem to be enjoying it either, and she was dancing all over them. 

Positives: DJ"}
{"text":"A group of us enjoyed a holiday luncheon at Hash yesterday and it was AMAZING! This was my second visit and I am loving this new location. The layout is so bright and airy, the food was piping hot, flavorful and creative and our server/waiter Chris was perfect. Great sense of humor, extremely courteous and helpful with the menu and fast and efficient. We waited for nothing because he had everything taken care of. I had the Huevo's Rancheros skillet and received a huge serving! I'll be coming back to dine here again!"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the most fun places for brunch.  Amazing Bloody Mary bar. Fun and delicious food options. DJ adds a nice touch for an upbeat morning with friends and family"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late brunch after a recommendation from a friend, and it did not disappoint. I did not see it on the menu but our wonderful waitress informed us that we could do a bottomless mimosa bar for $9 and 1 penny each mimosa after. We tried mango, grapefruit, strawberry, kiwi, orange, and black cherry were all delicious.  We started brunch with the hash monkey and my boyfriend informed me it was the best he had ever had. For our main courses we had the carnitas hash and chicken tienga frittata. The food was SO SO GOOD! The portions came out and they were so big and we said no way are we eating all this and of course we did.  The ambience was nice and quiet at about 1:00 pm when we arrived. Overall we loved it! I'd come back again and again! Wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"So excited to visit a new breakfast place near home, Hash Kitchen.    Gino, my server treated me with French Press coffee and the menu had many original and delicious selections.   I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had a pleasant first experience at Hash Kitchen! Went around 9 am on a Sunday and was lucky enough to be seated out in the patio on a beautiful morning before it got too warm. The menu is EXTENSIVE and there is a bit of everything for everyone, which I really appreciated. 

We got the cannoli donuts, herb fried chicken hash, and smoked salmon eggs benedict. The cannoli donuts came out warm and so tasty!! Seriously the best way to start out our breakfast. The chicken hash came came in a large serving size with a side of biscuit and man... I DEVOURED it. The fried chicken was cooked well and the poached eggs were done perfectly! The smoked salmon's poached eggs were perfect and the hollandaise sauce completed the dish.

Around 10 am, a live DJ came and played some tunes. There is also a bloody mary bar which seems to be a staple here. Our server was attentive and our overall experience was wonderful! I'd definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Super hip place for breakfast. Food was delicious and our server was wonderful. Our kiddo had pancakes... they were huge! We had a great meal here and recommend it for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and have drinks but the food was pretty bland, not very flavorful . Great environment and friendly service ."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit.  After all the great reviews I was looking forward to a great breakfast.  The Huevos Rancheros Hash was a complete dud.  The tortilla was so dry it couldn't even be cut with a knife.  I don't know what kind of meat was used but it was so tough it was impossible to chew.  I only ate the potatoes.  Get the picture?  What a total waste of money.  I wish I had sent it back."}
{"text":"The breakfast menu is exceptional.  Grand opening weekend offered complimentary Berry infused mimosa.  Got the lump crab bennie and was very impressed.  Egg was cooked to prefection, biscuit was light and fluffy with an ample amount of crab.  the side if potatoe was just okay.  Tried the bloody mary bar.... with endless possibilities.  Um ya yum."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast this weekend and this place is fabulous! I had the Mexicana Scrambler and it was fabulous! 
My husband ordered eggs over easy style and he said they came out perfect! 
I love love the Bloody Mary bar and the DJ! 
This is a great place for breakfast/brunch! 
Great place to ride your bike to breakfast. 
Another fabulous weekend at the Hash to celebrate my Birthday! Evan took care of our table while Lona was behind the bar mixing up our fabulous odrinks! As always Bonnie is the best hostess! 5 stars for all of the staff at the Hash! Y'all all rock  whoohoo"}
{"text":"I ate breakfast at hash kitchen today and it was amazing.  I did not know what to eat and my server helped me pick something out.  Short rib Benedict served on a potato cake, yum.  The atmosphere is fun and I go there every weekend if I could!"}
{"text":"The food and the ambience is amazing! We ordered the chilaquiles and the breakfast cannoli and everything was so good! The breakfast cannoli was my favorite! We met Bonnie, she was very friendly and made us feel welcomed!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Service was arrogant and slow.  Eating breakfast in a parking lot patio was not cool."}
{"text":"Delicious and good portions. I enjoyed the coffee a lot too!  Service was good, however think a little more attention to the floor could be improved, cue in to the amount of food and when you bring the bill if you are going to wait late to give it. I would rather have the bill sit there from the early part then to need to leave and can't because the attention isn't cued in that I am sitting not eating and want to go, waving down isn't something I feel proper to do, but did both times I came to dine in."}
{"text":"Having heard so much about Hash and the famous Bloody Mary station I was intrigued and had to try it for brunch but I didn't get to on this visit. 

The problem was Which location do I choose and Which location had a shorter wait time for Sunday. 
This location is nestled between the Safeway and surrounding shopping centers. When I arrived the location was not busy at all. There was a few people waiting outside but I was quoted 15-20 minute wait. 

No longer than 5 mins of  waiting and I was seated. The down fall that takes a star away is how long it took for the waiter to stop by and get our drink order or even greet my friend and I. He kept looking  at us and still kept passing us without a greeting. 

Finally he greeted us and was friendly and even made a couple suggestions from the menu. 
We ordered the mimosas sampler which was nice for the eye appeal  but  probably wouldn't order it again because the flavors were overpowering."}
{"text":"Me and my wife had the Thanksgiving week off so it was a good time to try one of my Yelp bookmarks. So Hash Kitchen was it today. 

We walk in and the hostess greets us with the great big smile and a really happy mood. Very friendly and was actually joking around with us. It sorta of brighten our perspective of this place right away. I noticed that the place was wide open. Tables spread out enough to give the place an open feeling. Not squishy at all. Bright and warm looking. 

Anyways took a little while for our server Vincente to greet us but got our drink orders once he came. 

I ordered the Carnitas Hash with a latte. The hash came in an iron skillet with potatoes, fried egg, shredded pork, fried crispy onions and an avocado on top. It came with a small side of tortilla. It was pretty good. I liked how everything came together and very filling. 

My wife ordered the breakfast burrito. It was a huge burrito. It had a fried egg, potatoes, bacon, grilled red peppers and onions with an avocado on top. Also came with Pico de gallo on the side which had raw jalapeños which made it really spicy. So my wife always likes to eat half and then switch plates. So this was one of those days. The burrito was very filling. Really good. Loved it. Usually these breakfast burritos has scrambled eggs but this one had an fried egg. It really made this burrito different and really good. 

The service was really good our server got tied up a little at the beginning but after he came he was spot on. Food came out pretty fast. He filled our water glasses in a timely manner and was very friendly. A few people came by to check on us too. 

So we really enjoyed our brunch. Service was spot on. Food was pretty good. Huge portions and just enjoyed the atmosphere. Very calm not rushing or anything. 

As I saw all the dishes coming out of the kitchen I noticed the burgers and sandwiches. They all looking very interesting and creative. Very nice presentation. So I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu. So for sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"My kiddo surprised me on Mother's Day with brunch here and what a surprise. It was jam packed up in here, up in here. We did have to wait an hour after our reservation time because of it. But I hit up the Bloody Mary bar and let me say I was giggling like a school girl who got her first makeover! Yummm

Then there was Ms. B... onnie. Hostess with the damn mostest! Honteyyyyy childddd. She is freaking AWESOME! She was dancing around and greeting folks. I was like heyyyy now get it girrrl. She had me cracking up. I wanna be like you when I grow up. Such a beautiful soul! 

Ok on to the food. I had the French toast, bacon and stole some of my sisters French fries. The rest of my group had omelettes, lump crab something with poached eggs, pancakes and grilled cheese. Everything was delicious and everyone seemed to enjoy what they ordered.I wld def visit again just prob not on a holiday or weekend."}
{"text":"The wife and I love Hash Kitchen, they put a twist on the \"normal\" breakfast dish. 

Hash Kitchen is beautiful, their decor is unique and fun. Bright and airy, can dine at table, booths or at the bar.  The hostesses are fun, polite and friendly. 

The servers are attentive and have good recommendations.

My wife and I always get two different things every time we come here so we can say we tried everything that we crave. This was my second time here and it just gets better and better. 

I had the breakfast burrito and had them add Italian sausage.  I wanted to lick the plate but my wife threatened me if I did. It's a great spot to meet friends too. Great for both breakfast and or lunch or both!"}
{"text":"NOT worth the wait! 
Was very excited to bring friends of mine that just moved to Scottsdale & arriving at 11:15a they said about a 40 min wait...over an hour later they said maybe 15 min so we lucked out & got seats at the bar. Fast-forward 30 min later (once seated at the bar) & ordered, I then get my 'ticket' to go & get in line at the BYO Bloody Mary bar. Trying to be nice but also expressing my frustration, the Bloody Mary Maven proceeded to have serious attitude with me! So literally in the subsequent 15 min it took me to get my Bloody Mary (45 min total at this point) I get back to my bar seat to find my breakfast has gotten cold. I asked that they send it back, take it off the tab, which they did & were super nice about, but really...why would we ever come back here??? If you know you're that busy on the weekend for Brunch, wouldn't you at least hire more staff &/or at least try to serve the people sitting right in front of you at the bar? Disappointed, Hash, severely disappointed."}
{"text":"My favorite  spot in Scottsdale hands down best breakfast with great atmosphere and service....Katie and Amy made our time warm and happy..."}
{"text":"Love Hash Kitchen! They have THE BEST Bloody Mary Bar!  Lona was amazing! great service! Plus during the summer on weekdays the Bloody Mary Bar is $5 and mimosas are $3! How can you beat that! 

This place is definitely my favorite brunch place!  Weekends are pretty crowded, so be prepared to wait! While you wait you can grab a Bloody Mary!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The Huevos Ranchero Hash and pancakes were so flavorful! It is my new favorite breakfast place, they have unique awesome food, that sets them apart from the rest! Our server Tyler was so nice and accommodating. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My first time at this location for Father's Day Brunch and the setting is very open and comfortable.  The staff is both attentive and personable.  Superior service consciousness and clearly efficient.  The Hash Kitchen dishes are creative, filling and delicious.  The Bloody Mary bar is off the chain as well as the their offering of fruity mimosas.  Clearly, a satisfying experience for me and my son.  Kudos..."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place, the food was amazing, I had the brisket which was a special for the Memorial Day holiday weekend. The Bloody Mary bar was a great touch worth checking out."}
{"text":"So glad we did Wednesday morning and didn't wait until the weekend. I can see why they have a 90 minute wait! Clean, creative and super nice people...this will be a grand slam location!"}
{"text":"Service was fine. Food below average and overpriced for what it was. Lump crab was a teaspoon full, corn hash beef was bad with undercooked potato cubes as hasbrowns and beef chunks weren't good either, fried chicken was over cooked and dry. And wait, the OJ on the menu says its fresh squeezed but when asked the server said its pasteurized from somewhere."}
{"text":"This was such a great experience.  It started with Bonnie greeting us.  She's so fantastic.  The DJ and music had me dancing in my seat the whole time.  I was blown away by the Bloody Mary bar and the Mimosa flight we had.  Then the food was creative and amazing. My sister and I sat at the bar, and Tatum was so much fun. I had the Benedict Fries, which she said I'd love.  She was right.  Who thought of that? Hollandaise on fries?  Just Bae.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I so enjoy their yummy breakfast and they make outstanding bloody Mary's. 
if you go on a Saturday there's a fun energy. Lunch is just as delightful."}
{"text":"Giving it three stars for the Bloody Mary bar and the atmosphere. The mimosa flight was also really good. Came by here for brunch on Saturday and had a short wait. DJ was playing music, but not too loud. Very cool and hip place, but that is where the positives end for me. All of the food was a bit bland. The corned beef hash was not good and they relay very heavy on their potatoes, that were dry and unseasoned. It is my favorite thing to order and this is the worst I've had from a restaurant. We also ordered a frittata, and it was also bland. This also came with potatoes, dry and tasteless. I had to get pico de gallo to add flavor to the frittata. The best thing was the pancakes. They were fluffy but had a nice crisp edge to them....heavenly. For a long time I couldn't get a waiter, but then three different people stopped by within a 2 minute time period....that was weird. 

Definitely say that you should check it out for yourself as it wasn't horrible, but beware that the food isn't all that great....at all, but willing to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was not good. We asked our server to split our check (before he even brought it out to us) and he told us that it would be a problem... we went in for the $3 mimosa special, and when our server brought our check out he had our mimosas listed as $6, when I asked the server about it he told us that we had to ask for the deal?? Even though it was not advertised anywhere that we needed to ask for the deal.. 
Took 20 minutes to get our bill after we asked for it. The hottest went to serve us and started to ask the manager a question and he said \"no you do it\". 

They need to work on their customer service. Wouldn't go back and pay $20 a meal for service like that.. bummer, really wanted this place to be great!"}
{"text":"Atrocious! 
We called over the phone to see how long the wait was and if we could put our names down. They said of course and that we would be next for a table when we got there. Upon arriving the manager met with us and told us, ' we dont do a wait list over the phone but we made a special case for you but dont do it again.' Saying it very loudly so everyone else waiting would hear. It was so rude and uncomfortable! Why didnt he just tell us that on the phone when we first called that it was first come first serve? We would have waited. Upon sitting down the entire meal took 2 hours!!! It took forever to get our food and only half of it came. The food was so-so and over expensive mimosas. The water smells like fish..... go ahead smell the water before you sip. You'll understand what I mean. Absolutely disgusting place, I have no idea why it has such high reviews."}
{"text":"We were greeted warmly as we entered the place on a Saturday morning, seated quickly, and our wonderful server gave us his suggestions since we were first timers. I went with the flat iron steak Benedict and my girlfriend had the lump crab hash. Both were great and cooked perfectly! We will definitely be back again. Good eats at a decent price!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing. I love Hash Kitchen, I've been here multiple times and the food and service has always been great. But today the service was absolutely HORRIBLE. The entire restaurant staff looked like they were running around without their heads attached and we had about 4 servers throughout our breakfast. Mind you, it's a weekday so it wasn't overly busy. The busser working his a** off was more helpful than any server or manager. I don't know that I'll be coming back to this location again. Side note - I'm not old or lame, but the DJ on the weekends is awkward and does not fit with the vibe."}
{"text":"To start the service was incredible. The staff was friendly, fun, and VERY excited to be working there. The Bloody Mary bar was incredible - something I've never seen before. We got the Mexican scramble, waffle, and chicken and waffles. Everything was very good but the spice on the chicken could be changed up a bit. I'm very excited to come back to this place!!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to brunch at this newer spot , but was disappointed as it dont meet my expectations. They had a DJ and played loud music which was a bit much. Better brunch places in the same area."}
{"text":"I love this place on the weekends. It's my favorite. I would NOT come back on a weekday at all! Kaity with the blonde streaks and nose ring was our waitress. We saw her when she took our order (20 mins after we sat down) when she checked on us  (after 15 mins of waiting I had to ask someone for some extra condiments) and when she brought the check. There was even a party of 6 that was seated 15 minutes after us and left 20 before us. I will definitely go back on a weekend, but NEVER on a weekday

UPDATE: I quickly got a lovely response from management addressing my concerns and inviting me back to either location. That's the Hash Kitchen I know and love"}
{"text":"Went here while visiting Scottsdale. Food and drinks were average, wait staff very friendly. Great concept."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Love this place and so glad they moved into the neighborhood. They are always friendly and attentive! Portions are huge! OMG.... Pancakes, french toast, waffles YUMMMMM
Several different kinds to choose from and all great. The bloody mary bar is the best in town if you like to get creative they have everything to doctor up the perfect cocktail. The only thing they need to improve on is their breakfast potatoes... They seem to be an afterthought for the busy kitchen... always undercooked and underseasoned... The mimosa flights are always fresh many different flavors changing all the time.  They would get 5 stars once the potatoes are improved. If you do not care for potatoes they are 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"This is hands down my new favorite breakfast/brunch spot in Scottsdale. I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu items. I got the smoked salmon frittata and it was really tasty. They have an amazing Bloody Mary bar that I sadly didn't get to try since it was a work day when I went. Bonnie the manger is very kind and accommodating. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Super tasty Bloody Mary's! I just order the orginal but they have a huge build your own station. Great food and service!"}
{"text":"Bad news, good news, great news:

Bad - Really long wait that they underestimated when giving us a wait time estimate. (Said it would be an hour, it was about an hour and 20 minutes). Things happen, but there were only two of us.

Good - Food was good. I wasn't that hungry by the time it came because the wait was so long we went to panera next door for a snack. (We were hungry, ok?) Also, I put a meatball in my Bloody Mary, which really filled me up.

Great - Bloody Mary Bar. I literally thought Bloody Mary Bars only existed in my dreams. Then I went up North Scottsdale road and found Hash and my dreams came literally true. 

Overall, good experience and good food. Definitely going back when I'm less hungry in order to accommodate the long wait time. Worth it."}
{"text":"Worst Service ever! came in during lunch on 7/17 and sat at the bar for about 15 minutes until we got acknowledged. I got faster service at taco bell last night, we ordered our drinks and placed our food order and to MY surprise the couple at the end of the bar that came in after got their food before we did!!! First time here and this place looks beautiful but i guess you cant judge a book by its cover because this book is horrible. I am sad to see such a beautiful restaurant being managed so poorly. Food was GREAT so KUDOS to the kitchen ONLY!! Thats it for now maybe ill be back tomorrow to visit the bartender Katie who ive heard so many great things about."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for breakfast!! Such an expansive menu with a variety of everything for everyone...almost all breakfast items imaginable are here!! Got the amazing chicken and waffles which is one of the best we have ever had!! Very tender fried chicken and very good waffle!! The lump crab sweet potato hash was also very good...little different with the sweet potato!! But the lump crab was good and the poached egg was well made!! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! Fun, cute atmosphere! Hash has great brunch and drink options. I've been there 3 times and have a great experience every time, everyone's very friendly, service wasn't the best my 3rd time but the food and atmosphere made up for it! Great go-to restaurant!"}
{"text":"What an amazing breakfast!  The service level was 5 Star and it was New Year's Eve!!!  Thank you Amy!"}
{"text":"YUMMY!!! This place is awesome!! The waffles are amazing! The bacon is so flavorful and thick. It was great! The staff was great! I'll have to try the bloody mary bar next time!"}
{"text":"If you need a fun place to brunch please go to this restaurant! Now the wait was a little long but to be expected on a Saturday afternoon. They do have a very big Bloody Mary bar to help pass the time. I came with a large group and my favorite part was the live DJ (and dancing with the staff) they have until 2:00pm and how quick and nice our server was. I don't remember her name but she had a short hairstyle and is from Michigan! 

I got the mimosa flight (which two of the four weren't that good) and the steak burrito! The steak burrito was HUGE I only ate half of it and it was soooo good! Next time, I probably would skip the flip and just order a single strawberry mimosa as that was my favorite one!"}
{"text":"The food was very good and the Bloody Mary's and Mimosas were on point. Definitely a great brunch spot to go to when you are around the area."}
{"text":"This was an excellent brunch experience. We started off with the Bloody Mary bar and it did not disappoint. Loved the bacon infused vodka. Once seated Gino was the best and took great care of us. The prosciutto eggs Benedict and fried chicken eggs Benedict were awesome. Thanks Gino and Hash Kitchen for a great brunch!!!"}
{"text":"Wowwwww. Amazing. Fresh. Great vibe. Exciting quality food. Went with a large group and absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"Went here based on recent reviews. I wondered if perhaps the high scores were primarily due to the Bloody Mary bar and Mimosa choices. Happy to say that is not the case! We only drank black coffee with our meal (coffee was absolutely excellent quality). I'm happy to say the food was fantastic. I got a scramble with chorizo which was perfect and both flavor and texture, not greasy at all. My husband got a skillet and said it was fantastic. Even the side of potatoes, well not fancy, we're done perfectly, not greasy at all. Biscuit was a nice \"dessert,\" I think the outside is lightly brushed with something sweet before baking. A lovely Touch of flavor with every fluffy bite. When we're in the neighborhood, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The basic Cornbeef Hash lacks flavor, over easy eggs came out with hard yokes. Music was good selection but volume could be brought down. Establishment attempt to create party atmosphere falls short during a Saturday breakfast."}
{"text":"My corned beef was made with love!  The freshness and flavor was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Oh my, the food here is amazing! Only 2nd to the great service by Anthony. The Coconut Encrusted French toast is amazing. Today I had the Pastrami and it was so good. My husband had the Chicken Benedict and he said it was the best thing on the menu. We made a special trip from the west side just to eat here. Definately worth the drive!"}
{"text":"With a Bloody Mary bar worthy of a Best of New Times award, The Hash Kitchen is the brunch spot you need to hit up.  The lump crab sweet potato hash is the perfect balance of sweet and savory, and the staff is phenomenal.  Chris was the most charismatic delightful server we have ever had!!"}
{"text":"I didn't care for my breakfast and still gave this place 5 stars. My table was wobbly and the waiter fixed it immediately. The coffee was great. The dishes delivered to others looked super tasty. My dish, the prosciutto benedict, just didn't taste good to me, the bread too hard, the pesto out of place, the prosciutto too fatty. They were willing to bring me something else for free, but I declined....not their fault I picked something I didn't like. I felt very well looked after and will gladly go back again."}
{"text":"Our first time and definitely will not be our last!  Creative food (without it being weird--some places are just weird!) that was served fresh, hot and tasted great!  Fun, AM cocktails, mimosas and a super clean, great looking Bloody Mary bar in the middle of the place.  We arrived at 8:20am--by 9:00am it was packed!  The food was great, the portion sizes big enough to fill you up without stuffing you, attentive, quality staff (Matthew, our waiter, was excellent), great coffee!  Can't wait to take my girlfriends here for brunch.  It is about time the Phoenix area had an exceptional and creative breakfast place!  Hash Kitchen is a total hit in my book!"}
{"text":"Brought my family here for Xmas and it was hands down my new favorite breakfast spot! Big portions and totally reasonable prices! Everyone loved their dishes and we were even able to accommodate my daughter who is vegan. Our attentive server Colton and the managers were on active duty to ensure our holiday breakfast was to perfection! They delivered and we all said -- we must YELP this bunch. I apologize for not remembering everyone's names. I had a shrimp eggs benedict with asparagus but what looked the most amazing choice was the huge, meaty pastrami sandwich! Everyone was very happy with their meals! The bloody mary bar is a must! We piled on jalepeno poppers, meatballs, bacon, celery, veggies, pickles into a fine art form of wonder! There was some confusion as to who our server was  at first and they apologized to us with some creamy donut deliciousness appetizer on the house! This is a well run, attention to the details kind of place! Keep up the customer service and incredible food. We sat out on the patio enjoying a sunny, 70's Christmas day that was divine. Thank you Hash Kitchen and to all your staff-- even the bartender at the Bloody Mary bar was personable!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Go for the bloody Mary it's the best.  Went to both locations this trip loved this place that much."}
{"text":"Had a nice brunch here on a weekday. The best part was the cheap mimosas! The service was great too, really attentive but not annoying. 

I had the Huevos Ranchero Hash. I was actually really excited for this dish, it sounded kind of unique and tasty. But it was pretty plain actually, I wouldn't order it again. Really the biggest missing piece her was some sort of sauce or cream, even sour cream would've made a difference. It was just super dry, which made it hard to enjoy the dish. 

Overall this was a cute space, with a nice deck. I would maybe go back and order something else that explicitly includes sauce!"}
{"text":"Simply put,good good! The mimosa is the best I've had thus far. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"One of the best spots in Arizona!! The chicken and waffles are REALLY REALLY good. Far better than Lo Lo's ( I'm from California so I'm educated in good food). Bottomless mimosas on Saturday! Why the f not. The hostess...the elderly supermodel who greets you is THE BEST !!! I would come back just to hang with her!! The waiters/waitresses are awesome, nice and they are always in good spirits. 

I always come on the weekend. There is a Dj here who definitely makes the atmosphere worth while!! 

Go. Bring your friend, gf/bf, dog, frenemy and whoever else!"}
{"text":"I visited on April 30th, and was really disappointed with our experience this time around. I've been coming here 1-2 times a month, and today was the first time I left feeling underwhelmed.  We were quoted 20-25 minutes for a table.  After 50 minutes I asked if they had lost our table, I was assured that they hadn't and it would be a few more minutes.  I got the feeling that the host was so overwhelmed with the chaos that he couldn't manage the situation.

We were seated after 1 hour and 10 minutes. It was another 15 before our server visited the table. We saw multiple couples who were sat after us have their orders taken, and food delivered before we were able to order.  When we received the food we were both underwhelmed with what we were given.  My side of bacon consisted of two raw pieces and one burned black; my friends scramble was watery and flat.

The bloody mary bar is a nice touch, and the server there always remembers what we order.  She is a rock star, and a benefit to the restaurant. Bonnie is also a wonderful ball of energy!

I'm not sure if something has changed here, or we just caught them on a very bad day but I likely won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"The carnitas hash was quite possibly the best breakfast I've ever had.  The hostess was delightful, the server eh.  I showed him my 5% Yelp coupon for checking in and he acknowledged it but didn't take it off the check.  I didn't say anything because it was otherwise a delightful experience and I will just save it for tomorrow.  The food was so awesome.  You should go here.


We came back today & had an even better experience.  This time Jesus was our server & he was Excellent!  The food was wonderful again.  He even told us about some other places by the same owner that we hope to try on our next visit to Scottsdale.  We will be back again tomorrow for our last breakfast of the trip.  No need to go anyplace else."}
{"text":"Awesome stomp sphere! They have flight of 4 mimosas and and an amazing Bloody Mary bar. I decided to try something different so I got a scrambler with smoked salmon, bacon, feta and spinach. I wish we had a Hash Kitchen back in Chicago!"}
{"text":"The best brunch place!  Been there at least 20 times and the food quality has never changed.  Love the DJ on the weekends! Coconut French toast are the best and Farm Burger is the best you'll ever have!!!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time coming to Hash Kitchen, And once again I was not disappointed. 

My only complaint is their wait system. They still do it old school and give out buzzers after signing up with the host. When the wait is over an hour long, you wish that you could go somewhere else in the meantime. Really hoping that they start to use NoWait so you can either get in line before hand or at least have the option to view your place in line and get a text when your table is ready.




Mimosa flight, amazing. Mine came with OG mimosa, peach, raspberry, and strawberry. I loved the peach and raspberry mimosas. Make sure to get a straw and mix them up to get the full flavor of the juice/muddled fruit! So delicious.

Breakfast/brunch are my favorite meals and I always have the hardest decision choosing between sweet or savory. 

Luckily, my friends and I ordered the breakfast bruschetta to share. We loved both the banana and Nutella bruschetta and the strawberry and Brie. 

For my entree, I ordered the hash chicken Benedict. The fried leeks are amazing and go so well with the fried chicken. Sometimes I have to stop myself from eating just the crispy leeks first because they're just that good. I have no idea what they bread their chicken with, but it's the perfect mix of savory and just blends so well with the leeks and biscuits.

Overall, I would definitely come back. The food and mimosa/bloody bar are 100% worth the wait."}
{"text":"Staff was extremely nice. Food looked amazing but was nothing to write home about. Got the carnitas hash but it was drenched in salsa so much i couldn't taste anything else. Would recommend going to downtown Scottsdale instead"}
{"text":"This place is my happy place. Lots of laughter and conversations happening outside of the restaurant. Host was super friendly. Bonnie is so adorable and attentive! I had literally one of everything. I highly recommend this please if you're looking for music, fun, high energy for breakfast and celebrations!"}
{"text":"This was perhaps the worst dining experience I have had in a long time. The menu, the venue and the concept is brilliant!  The staff, the manager and the food were horrible. The staff looked like it was completely disorganized, no one seemed to have any sense of urgency. Our food took so long, my sons eggs were raw, the chips with the huevos ranchero hash were inedible, like leather. Of the 10 tables being served while we were in there, all 10 had issue with their food, the lengthy wait or the lack of service from the staff. What a complete and total disappointment."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, a bit more on the pricey side but still very good. Restaurant is very spacious and depending on the day like any other place there isn't always a wait. Parking is a little difficult in that spot but other then that the staff is great and I've never had to get impatient with."}
{"text":"Brunch was good here. The place is hopping and a little crowded. The DJ makes for a trendy atmosphere but a bit more difficult to converse with the loud music. 

The food was good.  We had the cannoli donuts to start. I had the Cristina's tamale cakes, which ended up being sweeter than expected but the meat was good. The potatoes that came with the dish were nothing to write home about. 

The staff was friendly and kind."}
{"text":"When I first got there it looked like any other place but then when you walk in and you see some older lady shaking her money maker well!!?? 
The Dj was great,I had the breakfast lasagna and it was terrific and thr bloody Mary bar was very good! Would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"With such great reviews, I was excited to try this place but left utterly dissatisfied. 

We were seated on what seemed to be a slow day and had to wait a few minutes before we were even attended to with just water. When asked if we wanted something else to drink we said fresh squeezed orange juice, which they happened to be out of. Unsure of when the server would get back to our table and to avoid waiting any longer, we decided to order right then. We ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and the Huevos Rancheros THK Hash. 

The Lemon Ricotta Pancakes came out smelling of lemon and sweetness. With that scent wafting towards our noses, we got really excited to eat. However, while it smelt so good the lemon flavour seemed more for show than for taste, as it was nonexistent whilst eating the pancakes. I love a good ricotta hotcake and this just tasted like a regular, below average pancake lacking serious flavour and very inconsistent - the first pancake was overcooked and dried whereas the second was chewy. Also, the maple syrup was not warmed it had been cooked because when you pulled it up it formed fine toffee strings, like spiderwebs which indicates it had been cooked. 

The Huevos Rancheros THK Hash had the ever so slightest kick on some, not every, bite and was lacking in true Mexican flavour. The black beans seemed to be dried out and tasted of cardboard and there was an overabundance of red sauce poured over the meal. 

Based on my experience, I would be reluctant to recommend."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to go for Brunch! The best food, drinks, and atmosphere.  We have had numerous large Birthday parties and they have always taken care of us. Lorna is the mixmaster behind the bar, Evan always takes care of us Alyssa runs the BEST bloody bar and then Bonnie is always the best Hostess"}
{"text":"No wait for a table on a Monday morning. The deals on the drinks were awesome - $5 for the Bloody Mary bar instead of $12. My husband had the $3 mango mimosa and it was good. The food was another story - the biscuits and gravy were dry. The huevos ranchero hash was also dry and the meat was very fatty. We ordered a side of bacon and to our surprise, it was amazing! Overall a disappointing experience for such a hyped up place."}
{"text":"I'm tempted to give this place 4 stars but the food is so good I can't do it.  Reason for 4 stars would be hit or miss service.  The reason is they pack so many into the place that food delivery timing and tables per server are inconsistent.  Place can get SO noisy also, not the place for a quiet, relaxing breakfast - try Breakfast Joint if that's what you want.  But you will NOT leave hungry.  Take an Uber cuz they have lots of liquor!"}
{"text":"According to them their ratings on their door this is Phoenix finest and this is one of the top restaurants for breakfast. I ordered the eggs Benedict they had no substitution for their potatoes which have bell peppers in it and I'm highly allergic to bell pepper. The alternative was a biscuit a cup of fruit or toast. As the pictures are shown this is what I received and paid $16 for. This place was extremely loud looks like their main thing is there bloody Mary bar if that's what you're into looks like a pretty good place. The staff was friendly and was embarrassed of what they serve me for the value which is absolutely not the staffs fault, staff did a good job. But if this is the finest we have in the area for breakfast Arizona's in trouble."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, mediocre service, too loud, little pricey....Bloody Bar only reason to go.  Better make some adjustments before neighbors from the North start coming....they'll spend their money at Butters, Butterfields, Paradise Bakery, etc.  No wonder this location keeps evolving...haven't nailed the food yet............"}
{"text":"Live DJ and a Bloody Mary bar! Excellent wait. It's busy so be prepared to wait. I had the Nutella and banana French toast and they were delicious . Their coffee is really good."}
{"text":"We went here on my husband's birthday and that was a mistake. His breakfast was horrible. Not only was his sausage completely undercooked, but the \"hash\" potatoes were cold and soggy. We had such high expectations for this place. The sausage was returned to the kitchen where they apparently cooked it some more, however it did not look any different when they returned to the table with it. It was inedible. We told the waitress and she agreed, but handed us a bill for the entire thing, including his meal! We asked to speak with a manager - who then did the right thing &
took my husband's meal off of our bill. We will not be returning to this place unless we have to."}
{"text":"So many delicious menu items to choose from. It was hard to make a decision... It was a seafood kind of day so we ended up trying the crab roll and crab Benedict. The Benedict was very good, but could have used a little something more to top it (aside from the usual). The crispy potatoes/hash were also good. The roll was tasty and it was served as 2 rolls - perfect for sharing. The fries were perfectly crisp yet tender and nicely salted. 

On another occasion tried the pancake flight- yum!! A variety of sweet treats, also great to share with a dining companion. 

The indoor dining is a bit loud for my taste (trying a bit too hard in my opinion with a DJ and all), however we always enjoy our time on the patio."}
{"text":"This place is terrible for the wait and the lousy service. It's not a place I would come back to. 20 min wait for table. Currently at 30+ min for food"}
{"text":"Went in with Lisa and Hannah looking for a healthy lunch. We didn't just get a healthy and delicious lunch but I had an out of my mind and by far the best Bloody Mary I have ever tasted!!!! The service was awesome... Chris gets all 5 s!  Looking forward to have a delicious breakfast before leaving town today."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday and had a nice meal. Our server was sort of an ass, but the food was delicious and the Bloody Mary bar a lot of fun. We really liked the DJ spinning house and old school. There is always a wait so just be prepared. I suggest bringing a flask and ordering a Virgin Mary to save some scratch!!"}
{"text":"Finally I got to try the Hash kitchen. I love that they have limited breakfast and brunch only hours but what I love most is the Bloody Mary bar. OMG. I've been looking for one of these for awhile. I ordered the regular Bloody Mary but next time when I'm feeling more adventurous I'm going for the bar and building a creation. The appetizer was delicious with banana, strawberries, Nutella on sliced bread. The side of bacon was too die for. My entree wasn't as good as I would have liked. The Italian sausage was dry and the potatoes weren't as well cooked as I would have liked. Service was good though and for that you always get a pass with me."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Father's Day morning for breakfast and it was packed. Luckily, my wife and I were seated right away at a two person table. I noticed there was lemonade outside for those waiting. The ambience here is great with music playing and how the restaurant is setup. 

To drink, we ordered water and coffee. Coffee was tasty and fresh. For food, wife ordered a half order of Oreo pancakes and eggs over easy. I ordered the most popular item on the menu per our waitress, the Carnitas Hash. Wife thought Oreo pancakes were average. I tasted and I agree with her. Although they were good, there's better places for pancakes. Batter probably mixed with water. I enjoyed the Carnitas hash. They gave me a lot of carnitas which is very cool. The fried onions (think of Frenchies) is not a good addition per my taste buds as it sweetened the dish which I wasn't looking for. I took the fried onions off and the dish was much better. 

We will come back as the service is great, the coffee is tasty and the food was tasty. I'm looking forward to trying different items next time like the bread pudding French toast."}
{"text":"I had the BEST freaking breakfast experience here this morning. Luckily we got there early (by 9ish) and the place was already hopping. They told us 25 minute wait which seemed reasonable. (It became much more reasonable when I found my way to the build your own badass Bloody Mary bar.)
The bartender was super sweet and helpful. She guided us newbies through the drill and gave us tips like getting a celery stalk and using it as a cork board for a gazillion skewers of goodness. This made tasting every single item on the bar a breeze and I didn't need an assistant to carry anything. Who doesn't love gigantic meatballs, olives, pickled asparagus, mango jalapeños, slim jims, clams, cauliflower, onions and green beans in their Bloody Mary??? The shizz was UN.BELIEVABLE!! I'm pretty sure I'll dream about the drinks for the next few weeks, but that's a whole nother story! 
Food was off the chain. I got the veggie scramble and it was fabulous. The BF got some coconut banana pancake thing that he inhaled in 2 seconds. My buddy ordered the chilaquiles and loved them. 
The final touch that made breakfast so cool was the DJ. He was spinning radical tunes all through the meal. The service was excellent. 
Do yourself a favor and check this place out. You can thank me later"}
{"text":"Tried Hash Kitchen for the first time this past Thursday. This place is located in a strip-mall parking lot and offers convenient parking and an easy-to-navigate entrance.

We arrived around 10:00am and tables were readily available. The hostess was polite. We were nestled in a corner, quiet with a nice window view.

The waitress left much to be desired. She was more absent than present and seeming disinterested in being there.

We both ordered a breakfast benedict. Mine the salmon, hers the shrimp. Hollandaise on the side with a side of pancakes to split.

Food arrived, the eggs were poached hard. Potatoes with the meal were cold. Pancakes were fine but served with a very limited amount of syrup. 

It took nearly 15 minutes to have our eggs remade. At first, they only replaced the eggs of my breakfast-date and not mine... I had to specifically ask to have mine remade. The manager did stop by and apologize for the mistake. 

The restaurant is nice and fairly clean - nice ambiance and despite some larger groups, not too loud. The big windows allow for great light. We appreciated the large selection on the menu.

Pros: convenient location, good light / ambiance, despite being cold -
 food flavor was ok, nice hostess.

Cons: absent server, cold / incorrect food, not much of an effort to correct by staff.

I'd give this a solid 2.5/5 star rating. Next time, I'll try somewhere else."}
{"text":"A friend of mine is living in Phoenix temporarily and she suggested we try this place. There was a long wait which is apparently pretty standard especially on a Saturday for a party of 6. But we waited and it was worth it. 

I went with the lump crab hash was amazing. I usually don't try crab just anywhere as I'm from Maryland and we have some of the best crab ever but I decided to try it here and I'm happy I did. Anywho, the hash comes with sweet potatoes and two eggs any style and is topped with a hollandaise sauce. I loved it!

Also, go for the mimosa flight. You get four nice sized mimosas in different flavors and they're delicious!"}
{"text":"Loud but cheerful place serving mediocre food. Mimosa flight was underwhelming, so were frittatas.  Some ingredients requested were left out."}
{"text":"One thing to say Bloody Mary Bar off the charts!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, good service but the musical shitfest on weekend mornings makes it nearly unbearable. Do you enjoy thumping techno being blasted into your face and bass rattling your brain while you're trying to talk? Have I got a place for you. I looked around the restaurant and the only people showing any enjoyment of the auto tuned musical anthrax were staff members bobbing their heads like rejects from Night at the Roxbury. Takeout would be a good option, at least you wouldn't have to feel like you were inside an MRI machine to which a jackhammer was being enthusiastically applied."}
{"text":"Table of 9 at 10:30a, three of three egg dishes over cooked to overhard (ordered overeasy). Corned beef hash uneatable, lukewarm, potatoes mushy, low flavor, greasy. Long wait to get food, must have been in window too long. One of two waffles over cooked and burnt tasting. Below average service. Rough showing"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new in Scottsdale. A beacon of light guided me to Hash Kitchen. I was tempted to try everything on the menu but my stomach said go with the Breakfast Lasagna and I was not disappointed. One of the best breakfasts I've ever had. 5/7 would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I previously gave Hash Kitchen 5 stars, couldn't wait to bring my adult children when they visited.
I'm hoping I caught them on an off day and all the new restaurants opening are not diminishing the product. My son got a Bloody Mary per my recommendation. He came back with it virtually empty. They  had not refilled it so there was no bacon and many other items. Our meals were served without the biscuits. Our waiter told us they were making fresh ones, they'd be out in 5 minutes. 30 + minutes later we left without having them.
The food, previously amazing, was only adequate. I don't want to write this place off so I will be optimistic that this was an aberration."}
{"text":"Visiting from New Jersey and this was not only delicious but the best service we have had anywhere. The hostess was so friendly even with us having an infant with us and we can't say enough about our waiter Chris.  If you are in the area, I would highly recommend this wonderful restaurant"}
{"text":"The Mimosa Flight was amazing, and the Herb Fried Chicken was amazing as well. My friend had the Breakfast Lasagna and it was a game changer. It was my first time going there.  The staff was friendly and speedy. Definitely have to try the Blood Mary Bar next time."}
{"text":"I hesitated reviewing this restaurant until I read another review written today!
Interesting experience. I was at this same restaurant this morning! Wait wasn't bad, and we were welcomed with a friendly face. Once we were seated with a young toddler, we had to seek out our server after more than 10 minutes. Good thing I packed some snacks! We never had our server refill coffee, apologize that it took almost 30 minutes to get a side of fruit for the little one or do much else. She did serve one person in our party, and the dish was incorrect. She didn't really seem to be interested in us at all. It became quite unpleasant to have people waiting to be seated within 2 feet of me. It was so stressful to worry about how long we could stick it out with a young child. There are other places to have breakfast that sincerely care and have excellent food in the area."}
{"text":"First time eating at Hash Kitchen.  Everything was great.  Tyler was great, the food was great."}
{"text":"The spot for Sunday fun day! Katie the bartender rocks, great drinks! Chillaquiles and bloody Mary bar are the hit! Definitely a must in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Ok breakfast spot.  Food is not anything special.   Eggs are tasteless.  Prices are high.  Service is a bit slow.  Music is way too loud; I had to yell to speak to those at my table.  I gave it two stars because maybe it might seem \"cool\" for millennials.  But if good food and reasonable prices are your thing, this place is not it."}
{"text":"The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 is because it's a bit pricey for breakfast and I prefer the diner-type breakfasts.   But this place is GREAT if you're looking for lots of variety and very good food.  I will definitely return to try more of the many items that sound delicious."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Hash Kitchen. The food, decor, vibe. The wait was a little long (it was a Sunday morning) but they gave us mimosas while we waited so we were happy. The food was delicious - so many flavors. I had the salmon BLT and my girlfriends had the chicken and waffles. Fresh and quality ingredients! Next time I'm trying the Bloody Mary bar - I don't normally like them but I got to sample and it was delicious. They make their own tomato juice which is why it was so good (instead of that thick canned stuff). We will be back!"}
{"text":"Super cute spot! My friend and I came her before our spa day to check it out as we heard great things about this place. They were right. Great ambiance, great food and great customer service!"}
{"text":"If you love breakfast foods and culinary creativity, please go to Hash Kitchen, Bloody Mary's and Hashes, oh my!
The Bloody Mary bar is truly a come see. It is a buffet of ingredients where the bartender will take your personalized order and all Bloody Mary fans' imaginations can run wild. First, start off with a choice between three house-made liquor mixes including: cilantro and lime or jalapeno and cucumber. We chose cilantro and lime, and were lucky to get a freshly made batch! There are DIY skewers with mason jars holding delicious ingredients around the bar and range from basics like mozzarella, corn, and mushrooms to more extravagant pieces like bacon, beef jerky, and oysters. You can also ask to get extra bacon on the rim and extra spice as well! Needless to say, the drinks were amazing and there is something for everyone!
Next, we ordered our dishes. My fiancé ordered the Carnitas Hash and I ordered the Lump Crab and Sweet Potato Hash with hollandaise sauce (recommended and requested) on the side. The dish came fresh off the stove in a piping hot skillet; the flavors paired exceptionally well together with the poached egg, hollandaise, sweet potato, and crab all culminated into a new twist on tried and true breakfast favorites. The Carnitas Hash was delicious too; it reminded me of a deconstructed breakfast burrito, and again, the creativity and use of local flavors were what made the dish amazing: fried onions, poached eggs, tender carnitas, avocados - all of the above made for mouth-watering bite after bite!
At this point, we were practically stuffed, and we tried to leave without dessert but we just couldn't. We had to try the Cannoli Donuts, yes they are just what the sound like, donuts with cannoli filling in the middle. It was like eating a funnel cake topped with creamy cannoli stuffing- which is the best part of a cannoli! Our reaction? How has no one ever thought of this before?! And why is this not in donut shops everywhere?!
Besides the food, the customer service was spectacular. We were treated as if we were friends visiting another friend's home for a good meal. We were delighted to converse with Chris, one of the managers, who made great recommendations, and also made our first experience at Hash Kitchen fun and memorable. We cannot wait to take our friends and family here to show them one of the best breakfast spots in the Valley!

A few tips:
-Come during non-busy hours, apparently weekends are packed for good reason, there's a live DJ and the Bloody Mary bar boasts over 40 ingredients to select from. Get the Cilantro and Lime house mix for your base.
-Come here hungry, the portions are big and the ingredients are hearty, so this is a spot for those ready to indulge! Order the Carnitas Hash, the Lump Crab and Sweet Potato Hash, or Herb Chicken for the best flavors.
-Breakfast and lunch served all day.
-The restaurant is open to hosting your own private event, with no extra fee for the event space, which is a plus!"}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars because I think they missed the boat when they added the loud and somewhat obnoxious DJ music which not only gave me a headache but also the music genre was horribly chosen by the DJ.  The food was average and not anything memorable.  I did enjoy the atmosphere (minus the music) though.  The full bar with the open air backend was very nice and they had a spectacular bloody Mary bar with just about everything you could think of for your bloody Mary.  They even had vodka infused bacon.  Although the service was great the loud music killed it for me.  I will probably not return just for that reason alone."}
{"text":"Super cute and very good food. The atmosphere is a bit loud at brunch time in the morning (they have a DJ and it seems a little club-y). It's a fun place to start the morning though the the blue doy Mary bar is amazing. This place would really benefit from adding some vegan options or more healthy choices in general, I had the oatmeal, which wasn't bad, but t was oatmeal. The chicken and waffles and the s'mores French toast looked pretty tasty, too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing !!! Great food !!! Great service !!!! The best place to eat in Scottsdale!!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about The Hash Kitchen! After running some errands in the area, we decided to stop in for brunch!

We shared the Huevo Rancheros Hash and Bruch Bruschetta. The Huevo Rancheros Hash was a large portion, that was served on a hot skillet. It was filled with cilantro carne asada meat, two eggs of your choice, I picked poached, fried onions, and a biscuit. Lots of flavors going on it one dish!

The brunch bruschetta came with six pieces. One with chocolate and banana, strawberry and cream, lastly a bacon with some sort of sweet sauce. 

The prices were fair. $15 for the hash and $8 for the bruschetta. 

Our wait on a Saturday afternoon was about 15 minutes. We sat outside in the nice weather. Oh the weekends they have a Dj and big speakers! So we didn't want to be in the loud restaurant. And there was a huge party of 20 as well.

Our server was attentive and polite, can't miss him! He has a Jersey accent."}
{"text":"Wow what a great place to eat! My husband and I ate there for brunch ordering the bacon scramble and  chicken waffle. If you've never tried a chicken waffle don't let the name scare you, it was delicious. We also tried the spicy Bloody Mary infused with jalapeños, fantastic.
The customer service was great, the food was hot an prepared deliciously. I would recommend it !!"}
{"text":"Awesome Bloody Mary bar.... and the breakfast sandwich was AMAZING! Would definitely return, can't complain about anything. Yum!"}
{"text":"Bye bye Cuttlefish, hello The Hash!  We had a group of 15 for a Sunday birthday brunch. I have called 2 weeks ahead to reserve a table.  They don't normally accept reservations but only for big groups. I arrived early to drop off the cake and was told my reservation wasn't there.  I was a little stunned, but they were really accommodating to fit our party. 

I sure missed those motorcycle bike seats at the oyster bar when it was Cuttlefish. They took them out and replaced with a DIY Bloody Mary bar.  At $7, you get to customize however you like it.  I guess the V8 juice wasn't bad either for the non-drinkers.  Who doesn't like Slim Jims? The Slim Jims added the special kick in the drink plus made a great snack while waiting for our entrees. 

Herb Chicken and Waffles were popular among our table. I tried something different and went with the Herb Chicken Egg Benedict. My herb chicken was amazingly good. JL had the same chicken but hers wasn't that great. They must have made a different batch. We probably ordered all their herb chickens for that day.  As for the Egg Benedict, nothing too special. The hollandaise sauce might need a little work. It was really bland.  

For the coffee fans, must try the French Press. One of the better quality coffee blends a brunch place. It was so rich and smooth. I think I probably drank 1/2 of the pot. So good! 
 
The staff provided exceptional level of service. They kept our water and coffee filled at all times. When it was time for the cake, I believe it was the owner that went around the table and handed us with a new plate. He even brought and lighted the many candles on the cake.  

Another scrumptious brunch place big enough space to have a large group. They even have a live DJ by the bar area. I believe it ends at 1PM. I don't know if this location was cursed or what, but hopefully, this place can hold on and stick around a little longer."}
{"text":"Loved the different twist of menu items! Huevos Rancheros Hash was fabulous and my husband had Chicken Eggs Benedict which he loved. Can't wait to come back and try more items on the menu. Finally a non-boring breakfast choice!"}
{"text":"The happiest place on Scottsdale road!!! Friendliest staff and most delicious food!  From cocktails to bottomless mimosas this place knows how to party. The DJ on Sunday kept the vibe alive as Nana Bonnie and Aunt Linda were the hostess with the mostess.  Evan was just heaven with his prompt service and world class personality!!  We will definitely be coming back!! Did I mention the Bloody Mary bar?!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe the food will be amazing but having  DJ cranking music inside at 10a is not doing it.

I like what is spinning but WHY THIS LOUD??? We will go elsewhere.

UPDATE: so.... As soon as our server showed up things got much better (BUT STILL REALLY LOUD SO THERE WASNT MUCH TABLE CONVERSATION).

Bloody Mary bar is second to none. House infused vodkas, homemade mix, tons of fixings.... Best I've ever had.

Food was outstanding. Really really good!

We will be back, just not after 10a on a weekend.

The only thing preventing the 5-star review was the volume. I love loud music at concerts, headphones, and in the car. Just not over breakfast..."}
{"text":"The wait times are a little long but for good reason, this place is AWESOME! The Bloody Mary bar is a must and you could almost only get that as a meal. There was a DJ and the employees were all great. The food was very good and filling. I would highly recommend going for a brunch on Sat. or Sun."}
{"text":"Food: 7 / 10
Service: 5 / 10

The place was nice, the seating was nice, even the presentation of our dishes was nice. Prices were definitely on the more expensive side for a breakfast joint. Our server wasn't the most attentive, I had to wait for water twice. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros Hash, flavor was there. Mmm - but so was a huge piece of fat. Bleh. The biscuits were super good and they have a stellar Bloody Mary Bar.

All in all, whatever. I came, I saw, I ate. But next time I'll go to U.S. Egg"}
{"text":"My bestie decided he wanted to try brunch for his birthday. After reading a few reviews, we decided to try Hash Kitchen. There were about eight of us. A lot of the reviews said the wait was long but worth it. We got there and were seated within ten minutes. The restaurant was moderately to very busy, but we were attended to well. The menu is on the unique side (in a good way) and all the food was good. Some of us had a house bloody mary with bacon infused vodka, which was very tasty, but felt the portion could've been a little bigger for $9. The food, on the other hand, was generous in portion and quality was good. I could've taken half my plate home, but ate it all like a pig! Overall, a fun experience. They had a DJ there spinning tunes that were agreeable with the atmosphere. The noise factor was better than I expected, despite the large size of the space we were in and the amount of people that were there talking. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Hash Kitchen is located right off Frank Lloyd right, within the Safeway shopping center with inside and outside seating.  

Our Server was super nice, friendly and helpful but was very busy, the bar is extremely busy so be patient on bar drinks.  

The Food was absolutely delicious, large portions. The server recommended the French Toast and it hit the spot.  The Build your own Bloody Mary bar is in a league of its own and a must try."}
{"text":"Very trendy place! Loved the Bloody Mary bar. they had tons of different items to put on your Bloody Mary along with different flavor vodkas. Great place for a Sunday brunch, they have a Dj that plays good music which makes for a very lively atmosphere. Had a very good experience here."}
{"text":"This is a great brunch/breakfast place - especially during the summer when mimosas are cheap! The menu is unique and I've tried items both sweet and savory, and I was not disappointed. Great atmosphere, very bright and spacious. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Bartender was very nice.  The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the food is a little overpriced but that's really my only complaint."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for a while now.  So not good.  Paid $12 for a Bloody Mary bar and the weakest mix they had set my mouth on fire.  Three other customers agreed with me.  They tried to make it better by bringing me vodka and tomato juice.  Ugh.  Half of my bread pudding had pudding and the other half was toasted bread.  I just want to leave, but it has been 10min and no one has come by."}
{"text":"The food was delicious but on the pricy side; and it took a long time to come out. I am sure that is because this place was packed! There wasn't an open seat to be found. There was a large Bloody Mary bar that had a ridiculous selection of items to pop in it, so if bloody are your thing, you may really enjoy it. Unfortunately for me the DJ was waaay too much; too loud; too in the middle of everything. 
Go check it out once but it won't be a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"Based off of the reviews and menu online, we were super excited to try this place. Arrived at 11:30 on a Saturday and had to wait 25 minutes for a table--no biggie. They had a DJ who was BLASTING music, so we sat outside. I find it hard to believe that people want to feel like they're at the club when they're eating brunch, but perhaps I'm not hip enough. 

We ordered scramblers, chocolate chip pancakes, and steel cut oats. The scramblers were fine, but I thought the portion was a little small for the cost. They came with potatoes on the side that were undercooked to the point where they could not be saved by ketchup. There was also a buttermilk biscuit that was the best biscuit I've ever had, and the main reason why I gave them two stars instead of one. The oats were fine--would have been better with brown sugar, but our waitress never brought it after multiple asks. The chocolate chip pancakes were horrible. After being brought plain buttermilk pancakes, we received our correct order only to find that they were undercooked. They took them off of the bill, but at that point we just decided to cut our losses and get my daughter breakfast somewhere else. 

Also, they advertise their juices as \"fresh\" but it definitely was from concentrate. I have no problem with that, but if I'm paying $5.25 for a glass of orange juice and it's described as \"fresh\" I would expect something slightly better... 

Overall, mediocre food and spotty service. Really wanted to like this place, but I don't think we'll be returning."}
{"text":"The bloody mary bar is incredible and the carnitas skillet is absolutely to die for! I work across the street and it takes every ounce of strength in me not to order breakfast from here every morning! That being said... I can't wait to try the doughnuts!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and was very impressed. Started off with Bloody Mary that was great. We both had a Haskins breakfast and could not eat it all. Wait staff was great. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Omg! Everything was amazing from the donuts to eggs, French toast and chicken and waffles!!! Definitely coming back here not just for the food but to see Bonnie too"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful!  Great atmosphere, great staff and great food. 
We enjoyed the service and food. We had the huevos rancheros hash and the mexican omelet. The food was well seasoned, fresh and the presentation was stunning. We also had coffee. It was fresh and strong! And finally we had the mimosa sampler (flight), boy was that good!
Overall the experience was great.
Next time we will bring our fury friends and sit on patio and we will definitely try the bloody Mary byod station!"}
{"text":"I saw amazing reviews for this place and was excited to try it out. Went there a few weeks after it first opened and was disappointed. I had the pancakes and a house Bloody Mary and both were unimpressive. I'm a pancake guy and I thought IHOP does a better job than Hash Kitchen (that's not saying I think ihop is great, that's just pointing out that ihop, as low quality as their food is, has better pancakes than this place). The cakes were dense, not fluffy and more chewy than moist. The Blood Mary was just ok. My wife had the Mexican scramble which was average, but she did enjoy their guava mimosa. ** OUR SECOND VISIT many months later and the review above remains the same. Nothing impressive. This time I tried the lemon ricotta pancakes (which I always compare to Chelsea's Kitchen - see my review about them) and they were hard to swallow - literally, as they were more cardboard than anything. I save pancakes for one of my weekly cheat meals and unfortunately, these didn't satisfy that craving. If you're into pancakes this place will probably disappoint."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last Sunday for brunch!
The wait was a little long at 45 minutes, but I think that's pretty standard for a weekend brunch spot in North Scottsdale. They have a pretty big Bloody Mary bar that you can take advantage of while you wait.

The best part about this place is the $6 mimosas! They have several flavors to choose from. I got the blueberry first, and then the black cherry. Both were awesome! My food was also delicious! I got the prosciutto eggs Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was amazing and the ciabatta bread tasted fresh.

Overall I had a great experience and would go back! Just be prepared to wait awhile if you go on the weekend :)"}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary bar and incredible food. This is my favorite brunch place in Scottsdale. The Bloody Mary in itself could be a whole meal and is a great deal for the amount of toppings you can get on your drink"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the lump crab bennie's! They are perfect!  The corn beef hash was also delicious!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to the Hash Kitchen, I keep expecting it to be better than the last. I've been 3 times now and this time at the new location was by far the worst. First, let me start with the music, while I liked the music that was playing, it was so loud we couldn't really have a conversation. We were almost as far away as you could get from the speakers and even still it was difficult. 

Now, onto the service. We had a large group of people and a reservation. The reservation was for 11 am, we did not get seated until 11:30, that was after one of the women approached us asking it we wanted to be seated outside. Um.. No, we don't want to sit outside in the rain, are you kidding?!?! Then she went on the essentially threaten us by telling us if we let this table go they will give it to someone else and we'll just have to wait. We specified inside when the reservation was made. We then heard her ask several people if they wanted to sit outside, without any takers. That was just the start. As soon as we were seated we were repeatedly asked if the other people were going to show and hounded about the additional table. We finally just told them to take the table which left 7 people sitting around a small round table that comfortably seats 5. Kind of awkward. Our server took a very long time to serve drinks, take orders, bring checks, take payments and return for signatures. I wanted to get my remaining food wrapped up and I couldn't find him until he came to provide our bills to ask for that. When he came back, with the styrofoam box there was a black ink-like Fingerprint inside of it that was wet. Well, I was done at that point. Didn't wrap my food up and he never came back for more than a second for me to ask for a new box, but didn't terribly trust what I was going to get. The first experience was the best one as we went earlier in the morning and its been downhill from there. Doubtful I'll be going back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"We have visited the Hash Kitchen twice with good friends.  The hostess remembered us from previous times and greeted us with a big smile.
The food is amazing.  Our friends are  die~hard lump crab with sweet potatoes fans, which they state\" is out of this world\"  but we like to change it up a bit - I've had the caprese benedict (loved this great flavor) and have also tried the lump crab benedict.  Both were great - large servings.  My husband has had the frittatas and the skillet, his preferance was the skillet, he felt tht frittata was not as flavorable.   
Service has always been great - nice comfortable surroundings - we'll be coming here again."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The epitome of good food and hospitality.  Thanks to Yelp reviewers for leading us here.  My husband had steel cut oatmeal studded with blueberries, strawberries and almonds.  I ordered a corned beef Benedict. It was delicious.  Then the real fun started with a visit to the Bloody Mary bar.  Whee, so much stuff I couldn't decide.  Loved the pickled pineapple.  Gonna have to figure out how to do that.  They'll even shuck an oyster if you want it.  Don't how busy they are on the weekend.  We went on a Friday morning and we're seated and served right away.  Try it, I think you'll like it."}
{"text":"Pros:
The ATMOSPHERE (nuff said)-there is a live DJ who is so good of you like top 40, hip hop, and pop.
It's always crowded but that's what makes it live .
Unique flavor options to there food I had Oreo pancakes like what?! Amazing(it's a lot of food)
They have turkey bacon and sausage options and many options for veggies. 
I loved you can split a full order for most pancakes into a half also.
Drink while you wait!

Cons: the wait is loooooong I'm talking a hour long or more.
Not a lot of space to sit while waiting 
Scottsdale is Scottsdale so a lot of ppl were complaining about it being like a club but why come ? It's Sunday and we're brunchin! :)

Otherwise I'll be back with a group I loved it !"}
{"text":"I visited Hash Kitchen a couple months ago and our service was excellent, and the food was awesome as well. I liked it so much I told a group of my friends that we should go again. We went for Sunday brunch, and things seemed a little crazy and unorganized in there. We were underquoted for our wait time and ended up waiting 30 minutes longer than we were told. Our server was never present, we were given food without silverware, and then I had to physically get up to grab a manager to get silverware, syrup, water, and coffee refills. I am a server so I get it when you're busy, but our server never came back to quality check our food, and we felt as if we were a burden to be asking for anything. The food was awesome, and always is, but the service and management were very underwhelming. We were then approached by the manager to rate them on yelp, so here I am. I hope next time I come back that my experience will be like it was the first time."}
{"text":"First time here for Breakfast.  Food was spot on.
Service was great with server Rachel.

Restaurant is clean and inviting.

We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The food here is served in a skillet and is perfect for a lazy morning. The bloody Mary bar and the music just add to the great atmosphere. Difficult to get a table and very crowded on weekends. Slightly overpriced IMO."}
{"text":"This has quickly become my FAVORITE  restaurant. The staff is friendly and now know me by name, and order. This is the place I always choose to bring out of town friends. If you're on the fence, stop in and try all of the amazing food and THE GREATEST BLOODY MARY BAR EVER, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Very bad experience, waited 40 minutes for a table, then another group got seated 10 minutes after us and had their order taken within 5 minutes, we still hadn't been helped!  My wife's waffle was cold, wouldn't even melt the butter, but yet while we were waiting we saw a customer with the waffle at the bar that was very hot! To their credit they did remove her waffle from the bill, but too late, everyone in our party was underwhelmed. Spent $70 at the bar while waiting, once again, the fact that they were understaffed was incredible, the day after Thanksgiving? Really?  Need to get it together fast!  The experience at Gainey has always been awesome!"}
{"text":"I drive out of my way anytime I'm craving a Bloody Mary, which was today.  Let's be real, cons of this place is the wait. After the wait, everything is awesome. We had Gino serve us today and he was fast friendly and attentive. I normally get the lemon ricotta pancakes..... because duh, why wouldn't you. I tried the hash skillet today and it was ok but a little over cooked on the eggs. (Asked for over medium, received hard eggs) I did take the leftovers home. 

Regardless, this is a great restaurant and I will keep returning for the happiness I feel every time I'm here. Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"This breakfast place has good food and we would go there again.. the bigger thing to understand is this is not a good place if you want to eat with friends and chat, or have a nice meal with your spouse..The live music or DJ is so loud you get a headache eating.. if they seat you outside there is no space between you and the people waiting for eat.. 

The bigger thing is once you finish the make an overt effort to get you to leave.. very embarrassing for the employees and the manager who show up at your tase trying to take even more stuff off to get you to leave.

With practices like that they will not be in business Long."}
{"text":"WOW!  I've been wanting to check this place out, as many friends have given glowing recommendations about it.  Today was the day.

First I should say that we hit The Hash Kitchen around 10:00 a.m. on a Wednesday.  There was no wait, yet the restaurant was bustling with patrons, servers and other staff.  What struck me from the beginning was the wide open space.  Tables nicely spaced, set with cutlery and nice cotton napkins.  Great acoustics, too.  A conversation can be had and heard.

Our waiter, Gino, stepped in prompty, exuding his friendly mannerisms and immediately made us feel like a member of the family.  It was obvious that he would accomidate any request or change of established order.  It came across as if it was his life's mission to make sure we had everything we needed.  A rarity in today's ever impersonal society.

Our order came very quickly.  It was hot and appealing to the eye. I had the Lump Crab Eggs Benedict and it was seasoned perfectly.  I had not experienced crab with hollandaise sauce before...it may be in my dreams from now on.

Mom had classic Eggs Benedict, with special requests.  There was not the blink of an eye as it was served.  She ate well and seemed to enjoy each bite.  She was a little miffed that I didn't order her a Bloody Mary instead of the hot tea that is her normal morning beverage.  A mistake I won't make again.

When ordering, I was offered fresh O.J., a mimosa or a bloody mary.  This surprised me, as they are normally brunch type drinks. How wonderful to be able to have a brunch kind-of-meal 7 days a week.

This place rivals some of the best in the Valley for ambiance, cleanliness, generous portions, truly personal service and prices that will not break the bank.  It's a winner!

Many thank to the hostess, Aimee, for her smile, sense of humor and the menu to take home.

We will most definately be back/"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and the atmosphere is unbeatable. Check out the bloody mary bar!"}
{"text":"First time visiting (I live just 5 minutes north). Had a lovely late breakfast with a friend. Our Server was so knowledgeable and helped me modify my dish for my dietary restrictions (and was super creative about it). The portions were a nice, healthy size, the coffee was outstanding. I wish we could have had a drink, because the Bloody Mary bar looked AMAZING!! The space is lovely and our Hostess, Bonnie was so warm and welcoming. This will be my go-to space for breakfast and lunch from now on!!"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday and it was very crowded. The service was okay, we asked for a table for 5 people but they had thought we had said 3. Regardless they fixed the mistake shortly after ! The Bloody Mary bar was excellent. Food was good with lots of variety on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm still not ready to embrace the DJ at Sunday brunch phase... so there's that. The frittata was just a very, very sad circle shaped omelette with no flavor.

The good stuff was our server was awesome, coffee was tasty and always full.  Decor was unique and the best part was the Bloody Mary bar.  Overall, I probably wouldn't be back unless it was for a super sweet breakfast and drinks- all my friends raved about their French toast etc dishes."}
{"text":"Had a birthday brunch at Hash for my friend's mom. They said it would be a 20-60 min wait but we ended up getting in right away! It was Sunday midday so it was packed. 

The restaurant is one big room, very open and loud. There's not a lot of decor but the atmosphere is bright and lively. 

I started with a Bloody Mary from the Bloody Mary bar. You get to choose your salt rim, vodka and mix flavors, in addition to like FORTY skewer options! 

To eat I had the Oreo pancakes. The stack was massive and had good taste, but I thought they were a little dry and cakey. 

Overall it was a really cool place but for such a crowded and expensive place I wasn't too impressed."}
{"text":"OMG. This place is fantastic. They have an extensively creative menu for breakfast. I've eaten here 2 days in a row and it's all just awesome. The Bloody Mary bar is amazing. I've never seen one with so many different choices to add to your drink. Plus the drink itself is made with various delicious choices. They have a dog friendly patio area and a wrap around the outside bar as well. Plus they have a DJ spinning while you enjoy this sensory overloaded mealtime."}
{"text":"LOVE this breakfast spot- so modern and fun, as well as great tasting food. Will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"This is by far my most favorite brunch spot in Scottsdale! Yesterday was my second time dining there and I wasn't disappointed! 

After having a booze filled weekend in Old Town celebrating my friends 30th birthday, we decided we wanted to end the weekend with a fun, mimosa filled brunch. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by the amazing hostess Bonnie and she remembered seeing my husband and I at the restaurant a month ago. It was a really nice feeling for her to remember us and we had only been there once before!

Brunch was FANTASTIC. I had the Mexican scramble and a couple of others got the skillets. We definitely didn't need any doggy bags because everyone cleaned their plates :)

My husband enjoyed the delicious bloody mary bar and everyone at our table took full advantage of the bottomless mimosa deal!

To show you how amazing the service is at Hash Kitchen, they kept the restaurant open until almost 4:00 (it closes at 3:00), because our group was celebrating a birthday and we were all having such an amazing time drinking champagne and just enjoying ourselves. 

Thank you Hash Kitchen for the amazing food, atmosphere, drinks and service. You will absolutely see my friends and I again very soon. My husband and I are very excited for the North Scottsdale location that is opening soon!"}
{"text":"If you like your breakfast with alcohol, this is the place for you. I had a bottomless mimosa, (mango is the best) and some amazing pancakes (I had the berry pancakes) and it was like a godsend. The service is so friendly and personable (somehow we had an impromptu photo shoot? And the photos were high quality) the build your own Bloody Mary bar is 11/10 (and I don't even like bloody Mary's) 

Please come here, I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is poppin' on Sundays for brunch. Was in Scottsdale for a tournament this past weekend and after playing and reffing kickball in the rain for 9 hours straight, let's just say my friends and I went hard Saturday night. We were pretty much dying for food Sunday morning. We didn't get out to this place til around 12 and we had to wait an hour before we could get seated. 

There's indoor and outdoor seating, along with small tables and a huge bar. Right at the entrance, there's a Bloody Mary station where you can make your own Bloody Mary. The line for that was longggg. 

It has a decent sized menu with SO MANY AMAZING THINGS to choose from. Everything sounded delicious, I really couldn't decide, but I went with the Lump Crab & Sweet Potato Hash. It was reallyyy good, but I thought it was going to be like corned beef hash with the lump crab and sweet potato on top. I was sortaaaa disappointed, but it was really good nonetheless. 

Service was good for the most part. Our server was nice, but I could tell he was busy and we sort of just asked for all the things we needed at once because we weren't sure when we'd see him next. Prices are decent -- $12-16 but you get a HUGE amount. I definitely want to come back to try more things, but maybe come in earlier so we don't have to wait as long. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I can't begin to say how disappointed we all were let down at this restaurant.  Heard good reviews...but wow not what we expected.
Two of us got the Bloody Mary Bar... after one look at it I should have passed on it....looks like once they set it up no one goes back to refresh it...looked like a bomb went off in the middle of it....then asked the        bartender if they were bringing out and more meatballs since there were none.  She said no but then said there were ravioli, which there were 3 and I took one....it was like cardboard.....lunch was just ok, nothing special...when the meal arrived my friend asked for hot sauce which was never delivered ...half way thru her meal I got up and asked the hostess to get it for us....
Bottom line...never will go back !!!"}
{"text":"Over easy eggs were medium. Hash dishes were mostly potatoes.
Other than Bloody Mary bar, this place misses the boat."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and have never had a bad experience, the food is amazing, the staff is friendly, and I have never had to wait too long to get sat. They have a Bloody Mary and bar and the most delicious mimosas. This is my go to breakfast/brunch restaurant. I really wish I remembered the name of my waitress the has served me every time I've been their so I can give her some praise, but sadly I don't."}

{"text":"The Bloody Mary bar is awesome, but I was unimpressed with my breakfast. I thought it would be hard to mess up an egg scrambler but they did... the eggs were cooked far too long. I've had the same issue with the Gainey location which is disappointing because I really want to like this place."}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary Bar in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area!!! Drinks, food, and staff are fantastic! The DJ on Saturdays and Sunday's plays a great variety as well. Ask for Chris, he's awesome!"}
{"text":"Although the atmosphere was pleasant at first, I quickly realized this is a breakfast place for alcoholics. The wait was outrageous. Service was okay but not great. Food was just okay and didn't match the price. Quite expensive for a breakfast joint. Turns into a loud \"club-like\" atmosphere after 9AM. I live around here and highly recommend Butterfields instead."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, great staff. We have eaten here probably a doze now and the staff is always prompt and the food is always good, no matter what you order. Usually not much of a wait if any."}
{"text":"Came with a party of 4 for brunch. 2 of us tapped the bloody mary bar. Both of the parties' drink looked real good and pretty impressive. 

I ordered the Oreo cookie pancakes. Holy shit. These were so good - like eating chocolate cake. Everyone else said their meal was amazing to \"good\". 
Didnt give it a perfect 5 star rating because they dont have fresh squeezed OJ and no sour dough toast. I know im nit picking. It's a great spot and cant wait to return"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place and even more excited that I read they would be open on Christmas Day! The husband and I made the 30 min drive out to the restaurant to find... they're closed! Bummer. Not sure if this was an error on Hash Kitchen's side or the New Times, but it was pretty sad. Anyway, I still wanted to try them out, so a few days later we made the trek out there again. The restaurant still looks like the old Cuttlefish restaurant, including the oyster bar, which is a bit strange. The service was good, but one of the women there, maybe the owner or manager wasn't being terribly nice to her employees within earshot of customers. Anyway, we had coffee, which was good and the waiter kept it full, so we appreciated that. For food, I tried a benedict and the husband had biscuits and gravy. The b&g was bland and nothing special. The benedict had perfectly cooked eggs, but lacked in flavor.... overall we weren't super impressed. Maybe the secret is to order one of their more complicated dishes (something with fried chicken possibly) and that would be good, but generally you also expect a restaurant to have good foundations. I probably wouldn't make the drive out there to return."}
{"text":"WORTH THE WAIT. This is the brunch version of a hip night club, including a DJ playing good tunes.  One of the highlights was the Bloody Mary bar with every condiment you can think of and then some. Hubs ordered crab eggs bene, 11YO had chicken fingers and I had the salmon frittata, all nicely played and superb flavor. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fabulous, fun restaurant!!! The food is amazing! The staff is even more amazing, especially Bonnie and Chris....they were so friendly and so funny!! I will for sure be returning with even more friends and family!!!"}
{"text":"So apparently this place has two different locations, which I was unaware of because my friend and I met at the wrong place for brunch. Lol

It was a Saturday when we came for brunch, it was busy but we got seated pretty quickly. I ordered the corn beef hash and the fruity pebbles cocktail. The corned beef was good, although I felt it should've been cooked a little longer. It's a prettty big portion too. Omg the fruity pebbles cocktail was amazing! They definitely don't mess around with their drinks here. I loved it!!

I'll definitely be back to try some more of their specialty drinks and some other food items!"}
{"text":"I came in yesterday for lunch after the Jewish New Year services. Very cute and trendy place. We had a party of 6 and sat down in the corner. We were all starving so we were looking to order asap. But for some reason, we sat for 15 min w out anyone coming over or even pouring us water. So that was a little disappointment especially since the restaurant was not packed at all. Eventually our server came over and we started ordering. I got the Bloody Mary since you can make your own n my other two friends raved about this new brunch spot so I was very looking forward to it! I love the Bloody Mary bar! You can add so many different things!! I added beef jerked, jalepenos, jalepeno olives, pickes, salami, celery u name it!! My friend and I both ordered the huevos ranchero hash while my husband ordered the corned beef hash. And my girlfriend and her kids ordered the flat iron steak hash and the Oreo pancakes. Oh and I got a side of bacon! I enjoyed my huevos ranchero hash but I was expecting my hash potatoes to be more like hash browns, thinly chopped and crispy. But they were more like bite size potato pieces and they weren't that crispy. I took a bite of everyone elses' dishes and they were all very good. Next time for me, I don't think I would order the hash dish again. Too many potatoes for my taste. But overall everything was good. And I finished it off a strawberry mimosa!! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Service and Food was amazing!  Thank you Bonnie and Lona for making my first experience at Hash Kitchen a memorable one!!!"}
{"text":"Tried yesterday, service outstanding, food delicious.  Would love to go on the weekend for a bloody!"}
{"text":"I had the salmon eggs benedict, which I thought was tasty. The vibes were cool, and the staff was friendly. I went the day after Christmas, so that morning it was short staffed, and people started to swarm, so it took a little longer than normal to get my food; but I had realistic expectations, and I just don't get uptight about stuff like that. It did look a little more upscale than I anticipated, and I don't really like that \"luxury\" look, but otherwise it was pretty cool.

I'd go eat here again."}
{"text":"Now my go-to breakfast spot! Everyone is friendly and helpful the minute you walk in the door. Tried the Lump Crab and Sweet Potato Hash off the recommendation of our awesome server Chris. It did not disappoint! The eggs were cooked perfectly, sweet potatoes delicious, and that buttermilk biscuit!!! Yum! Can't wait to try a few of their Eggs Benedict options and when I'm ready for something sweet the variety of French Toasts are mouth watering! Best breakfast to kick off the new year! Thanks Hash Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Excellent hash!  I would highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast or lunch!  Great food, nice atmosphere and great service!  Kris provided superb service!  We had carnitas hash with sweet potato and corned beef!  Both were excellent!!"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite for Sunday brunch, wait time can sometimes me more then an hour, however they have a Bloody Mary bar that is the bomb... the wait is still crazy great food, amazing service"}
{"text":"This place was so wonderful!! From the atmosphere, to the service, to the food! I cannot wait to go back. For those who like Bloody Mary's (not a personal fan) they have the most extensive Bloody Mary bar I have ever seen!!! They have every garnish you could ever think of! Definitely try to go before 10am on the weekend, that's when the crowds really hit! I just can't say enough about this place!  New favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"AMAZING bloody mary bar, but it took AN HOUR with two toddlers to get a table!!!! Good food and generous portions. Bloody mary is a bit pricey but you can make it a whole meal hahahaha"}
{"text":"Super simple ... come here and be amazed! Sat at the bar for breakfast and watched the masterpieces being created at the Bloody Mary bar. Served by Falyn and Weston ... remarkable at making sure everything was perfect. Come here and be amazed!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday and enjoyed the DJ in house. The Build Your Own Bloody Mary Bar is awesome!... complete with tons of bacon, jalapeño poppers and tons more! Chicken and Waffles were also amazing!
Our server Jen took excellent care of us! Highly recommend everything about this place, wish we lived closer!"}
{"text":"I stand corrected! Last weekend, I go the veggie scramble and swapped the eggs for hash. It was delicious. The potatoes and the variety of vegetables mixes perfectly together. I can't wait to get this again. Hash Kitchen is a fun and lively spot to catch up with friends and grab a yummy bite. :)"}
{"text":"Adrian, the Bloody Mary master, makes the best Bloody Mary I've ever had. Absolutely delicious. Don't even have a photo to show because I drank it so fast. It's a bar with anything you would want to add to a Bloody Mary. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Food is ok but the service is horrible.  Really slow. The long wait just to get seated then an even longer wait to have a waiter actually show up. Lots of better places than this to go.  Would not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is great. I had the chilaquiles. The only thing I would say that could be better is that the eggs were very small (almost no yolk on either). But they brought me two more no charge. Other than that it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Another great breakfast at Hash Kitchen only this time was a first at this location. Server was on point, food was too. Best breakfast in town."}
{"text":"Such a Great Experience! The chicken & waffle are wonderful. The pancake are the best I have ever had"}
{"text":"Great local breakfast place! Fabulous bloody mary bar. Probably the best I've ever seen. Their breakfast burrito is really good. The food is very fresh and delicious. I personally don't love the potatoes in the hash (soft, not crispy), but all my friends like it - so it must be me :)"}
{"text":"So busy yet fast friendly service!!  Little loud.  Try the flight of mimosas!!  No military disc and kinda $$$."}
{"text":"Found 3 decent size pieces of avocado peel in my cesar salad, which my salad didn't even have avocado in the first place. Manager just took them from my hand when I showed them to her, looked confused obviously, then went to the kitchen and never came back. Never offered to re-make the salad or anything, a little disappointing service."}
{"text":"First timer at this restaurant, walked in to a nicely decorated area with a very friendly hostess that sat us outside on the patio. 

They have a nice Bloody Mary bar where you can add a variety of goodies to your drink. Even oysters if you enjoy seafood in your cocktail. 

We had French press coffee, and the meal of choice was the carnitas hash with coke braised pork. 

They had a lot of sweet breakfasts which looked great from a distance. We did not try these but as they were brought to other tables we def stared. 

It's a good spot for breakfast. And reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Short and sweet .....great prices , many choices , great food and terrific service"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the area in the morning and decided that we wanted to grab brunch and a good Bloody Mary. I found Hash Kitchen nearby on Google Maps and noticed it was also on my list of recommended restaurants to try from friends and family. We decided to give it a try and it was EXACTLY what we were looking for!
 
The place was bumping! We were lucky enough to get a table outside right away. I had the carnitas hash, which was excellent!! We both had the build your own bloody mary bar too! It was fun being able to pick our own infused vodka, bloody mary mix, and choose from the HUGE VARIETY of toppings!! The maple bacon was a big favorite for both of us!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, however the food was awful. Server was great and had the bad food taken off the bill. Manager was nice and came by to follow up."}
{"text":"1) The bloody mary bar is awesome. We sat at the regular bar and watched the bartender replenish their in house infused vodkas. A lot of work goes into their bloody marys and it pays off!

2) The food is delicious and portions are just right

3) The service is stellar. We sat at the bar because we didn't feel much like waiting for a table and we had great service (from both bartenders and the managers checking in on everyone)"}
{"text":"This is an awesome Sunday brunch spot! Short wait for a place as busy as it was. (Under 20 minutes in the Peek of brunch time). 

Food was delicious, mimosas were amazing! (I recommend the guava!)

Service was even better. Jesus was our server and he was awesome, and then there is Bonnie. 
She was the life of the party!! Bonnie is amazing and you should check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place was nothing short of amazing! atmosphere with the dj and great service was unbeatable. Prices were competitive and the food was outstanding. Hands down best corned beef and hash and chicken chilaquiles ever."}
{"text":"It was the most amazing breakfast ever! The entertainment was almost as Awesome as the food. The servers and host staff couldn't do enough Presentation was incredible .Would never hesitate to take people there. Thank You for making my husbands \"75th\" birthday a memorial event. Must try the the cannoli donuts. More  food than most places, VERY MUCH worth the trip! !  !"}
{"text":"I'm always up for trying anew brunch place, I really wanted to like this place, but...I just didn't. I came by here for Saturday brunch after a run with my honey. First, we felt out of place because this place is fancier than the name suggests: hostesses in very nice dresses, dj, bartender, etc. Then, we were shocked by the prices. Maybe there should be another way to rate prices for breakfast places, but paying $12-$15 a plate for breakfast is more than we expected for eggs benedict or a hash dish. Although the food was fairly good, it just wasn't as mind-blowingly good as I had heard it would be or as I would hope it would be for the price. Overall, I have to say that the service was great. The servers and hostesses were attentive and helpful. Everyone around me seemed to be enjoying their meals. This place just wasn't for me."}
{"text":"Great service, food & music! Love the atmosphere and the hostess was everything! fruit was not that good on the fruit tray but the french toast was amazing!"}
{"text":"Tried breakfast here recently and thought it was just ok. Been reading reviews about the best breakfast being here, and unfortunately I disagree. 
Met some friends for brunch with high hopes. Nothing was bad, but nothing was great either. Won't need to return."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic brunch here!!awesome Bloody Mary bar, morning DJ!! Food was great also!! Definitely will be returning"}
{"text":"Super yummy!!! Came in with the family, great service from Jesus and super good and flavorful food! I had the chilaquelies and it was GREAT! Kids got pancakes and also a side scrambled egg with cheese. They loved it! Oh we also ordered the fruit board, again very fresh and good! We will definitely be back, very happy they are here in the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Wow Wow and WOW. We just found Hash Kitchen the last time we were in Scottsdale- and got there early on a Sunday morning. We were able to sit outside which was nice, and our server was super chill as well. I had the juevos racheros hash and my hubby had the corned beef hash. Both were amazing! Be prepared to roll out of there because the portions are huge. The biscuit that comes with is fresh daily - and SO GOOD."}
{"text":"What a great place. Don't get discourage when you pull in and it looks packed. The staff is super nice and our wait was 20 min shorter than what they told us. 

We had chicken and waffles, skillets and best of all the Bloody Mary bar. I had it with their house infused bacon vodka with bacon salt and you get to add all the goods. Tip, put the celery stalk on first and then you can build on that and get more stuff. 

Defiantly bringing friends back when they visit."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an ordinary breakfast meal, any place will be fine. But if you have a refined palate and want an amazing breakfast, go to Hash Kitchen! This brand new place offers a large selection of breakfast meals like eggs Benedict, burgers, salads, pancakes, and more...and for the second time I was speechless!! The smoked salmon eggs Benedict that I ordered was delicious and cooked to perfection!! My friend had the Italian sausage eggs Benedict and she was impressed too! Melissa, our waitress, was friendly and professional. The entire staff welcomes you with a big smile. (Very important factor). Parking is available anywhere you like in the plaza. Conclusion: I recommend this place and I'll come back soon with more buddies!! ;-)"}
{"text":"I really love the vibe in this place, everyone's very friendly, the DJ was a welcome surprise. However if you're wanting to go there and have a conversation it is extremely loud, even the servers and bartenders have to yell to be heard.  I went in on a Sunday late morning with a friend and we sat at the bar. Neither of us had a cocktail but I could see that the booze was flowing and the bloody Mary bar looked great. I ordered a bacon scramble and my friend ordered some sort of eggs Benedict. My scrambled eggs were over cooked to the point that they were brown and dried out . The cubed fried potatoes were greasy but the buttermilk biscuit was perfect, flaky and moist. Even though my plate was still three quarters full when the bartender took it away she still never asked me how my food was.  All she asked me was if I was finished? Going forward I think I'll stick to Butterfields,I may have to wait 20 minutes to get a table but it's always worth it!"}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast in the morning.. food came out with good presentation. However, it was not hot as in temperature wise though. Coffee was also luke-warm. At 8:00 in the morning, I'm not really interested in hearing the \"LA's top 100\" of music at levels that were too loud for me. Since there is a bar in house, you also get to see other patrons ordering shots of liquor with their breakfast. Truly, a moving experience to say the least. My breakfast came to almost $25 with tip to the help. I'm not old fashioned, but possibly a little too \"Hipster\" for my simple pleasure of just eating breakfast in the morning."}
{"text":"Definitely our favorite \"go to\" breakfast choice. Not only is the food excellent, but the presentation, service and friendly service make it even better. If you like Mimosas or Bloody Mary's with your breakfast, they have several options. OR if you want more they have a well stocked full bar. Glad this place is close to home. Our kids love it too. Excellent kids menu options as well."}
{"text":"All-in-all this was a much better experience than when we visited here in May. The management along with having a great server made this visit very pleasurable. We had no problem this time with the french press and the coffee was excellent; fresh, smooth with no bitterness.  The food once again was very good. The service is tops, the staff really go out of their way to make sure you are happy and that meant a lot to us. The only downside is the noise level. It is a bit to much; between the morning hubbub and the DJ it makes for a bit too much noise. We started with the Cannoli Donuts; they are just delicious, warm, moist with that wonderful cannoli cream and chocolate chips. I had the Americano Scrambler which was delicious and creamy, my mother had the Hash Frittata which she really enjoyed it but it was a little bland for my taste. Both these entrees came with hash browns that are very good, seasoned perfectly and a biscuit which are light and flaky; I could have eaten more than one! My husband had the plain waffle and he commented on how the outside was crispy and nice and moist inside. Everything came out hot like you want with lots of soft butter. Our next visit will probably be when it cools down and we can sit outside on the patio where it is quieter."}
{"text":"Not for weekday breakfast.  Loud music at 7am on a Tuesday doesn't work for business meetings, talking to your spouse, or retirees.  The Tamale Cakes were good and different.  The huevos rancheros hash had good flavor.  Odd that for a place with Hash in its name, the potatoes were very average.

Prices are quite high. A Benedict, a hash, and a cup of coffee was $33 before tip.  There are better weekday breakfasts out there."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite. Needs a little more flavour though. Service was really good."}
{"text":"Wow ,my first day in town and my niece and we drove right over here.  The place has a  creative design and concept . Friendly staff as well . Try the scramblers  they come with homemade biscuits omg!  I've got to work out extra today.  We will be back can't wait to try the mimosa bar next time"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast or brunch place with a nice patio (with misters) plenty of parking and good service. Highly recommend their Benedict selections! Also have cappuccinos & lattes.Best feature is their Bloody Mary \"Make it yourself\" station. Must check this place out"}
{"text":"This place has a great creative breakfast! They have a mimosa bar for adults and drinks for kids. They had a DJ that made it fun. Great for family's and friends brunches."}
{"text":"Food is good and the BYOBM is awesome but they only have meatballs on sat and sun!.... They should definitely have meatballs on holidays too! I highly recommend anybody that is visiting AZ or looking for good brunch to come and check out Hash kitchen! This is definitely worth your time to come and get some amazing food!"}
{"text":"Look, the food isn't very good. I love the ambiance, the friendly staff, and the DJ. Just don't expect delicious food. 

I'm a chilaquiles connoisseur. Hash Kitchen's are mediocre. The green sauce is too sour. 

My daughter's scrambled eggs were served runny and raw. We complained and were brought burnt, brown eggs instead. 

My son ordered the kids' pancakes but we all agreed they tasted lemony, so I think he was served the wrong kind. 

Last time I came, my husband and I were disappointed by the eggs Benedict (bland) and the carnitas hash, which was too oily. Eggs over medium are served over easy. 

Our servers were incredible both times and their Bloody Mary Bar looks incredible, so I'm giving 3 stars despite disappointing food. This time, the manager came over and comped the kids' food since they didn't eat it. They also gave us some complimentary donuts to go!

I'm hoping these are growing pains since they opened just recently. I'll wait a while before coming back for the lines to die down & the food to improve."}
{"text":"What a lovely little place this is! Uber friendly service too. Not only was our waitress very kind and accomodating but several of the other staff members as well as the owner greeted us throughout our meal to ensure all was well. I'm super impressed! Love the decor and the music they play. Not too hipster, but just hip enough.

The lemon ricotta pancakes were the absolute highlight of my brunch visit. So scrumptious! 

I will be trying the cannoli ones next!"}
{"text":"We came here on their opening day. Food was very good and the servers were eager to please. The service was slow however but hey will work things out. We'll be back to try the mimosas!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and excellent service! I had the Mexicana and it was very tasty. When you come, ask for Gino. He will take care of you!"}
{"text":"One word:  divine.  Truly.  Everything from the Bloody Mary bar, to the many many dishes that aren't diet friendly but sooooooooo good!!"}
{"text":"The hostess hospitality is quite possibly some of the best I have ever seen.  Like something out of a 1960s high class Sinatra lounge.  What a great way to be greeted and welcomed before a meal.  That's five stars by itself.  

I find the cuisine here to be on point.  Never any issue with substitutions or side orders and the like.  Wait staff is always sympathetic to dietary preferences and I have much appreciation for that.  Busy mornings and the service is still quite good, quick and never rushed."}
{"text":"Really great food and super quick service. I'm definitely going to go back to try the Bloody Mary bar or the mimosa flights. The drip coffee was also fantastic, so I can only imagine how great their specialty drinks are. Definitely a place to go for a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Very wonderful wonderful wonderful place ! The food was absolutely AMAZING  the whole atmosphere was fantastic from the moment I walked in to the moment I left . Bonnie is truly a gift from above . She made our dining experience just excellent . I had order the Americano Scrambler and it's to die . The bartender made my mimosa excellent . One of the managers ( she is Hispanic ) she also was a gift from above . Her and Bonnie are absolutely amazing and made everything A+ . I definitely will be coming back and I definitely would recommend this place to everyone . 

* Thank You Bonnie so much * you are truly amazing sweetheart"}
{"text":"Very creative menu but not impressed with the quality of the eggs or hash browns. The burger was excellent and I drooled over the French toast passing by."}
{"text":"Today we finally made it down to Hash Kitchen to give it a try after recommendations from friends. We were seated promptly even during a busy Arizona Breakfast week. I visited their make your own Bloody Mary bar,which is second to none, and created the most gluttonous Bloody Mary ever. My wife ordered her new go to breakfast dish which she tries every place we go now. Their twist on chicken and waffles is Herb Crusted Chicken and Waffles topped with fried leeks and she was in food heaven. My son's chocolate chip pancakes were a perfect mix of sweet and light with a delicious maple reduction syrup. I had the Ranchero Hash which was perfectly crispy tortilla chips on a bed of black beans, potato hash, and carne asada topped with an on point over easy egg. Our dessert, which we would have never ordered for breakfast, was a sweet and savory house made cannoli donut. The best part of all was when the owner came out and introduced herself and chatted with us for several minutes. We felt extremely well-taken care of and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The service. I can't say enough about the service. Our server Vincent IS the ideal server. Very attentive, compassionate and great listener. I wish every server was Vincent.  He even refilled my water after we paid. (I usually am ignored after I pay)
Very accommodating. Excellent service all around. The hosts goes around to make sure everything is ok. They talk to the kids.   When the kiddo got cold outside we were able to be seated inside without problems.  They are always going around making sure everything is ok
The food. Big proportions and tastes great. Great Bloody Mary bar also. I don't like bloody Mary's but I tried my friend's and I actually liked it. I had the mimosa flight and it was worth it. 
The music. I read how it is super loud in the restaurant when there music goes on. It wasn't that bad. You could still hold a conversation 
If I can give it more than 5 stars I would"}
{"text":"Music, drinks, and mouthwatering food- can every day start this way? Go early or plan on a wait, but even the wait is worth it. They have a bar so you can grab a drink to make your wait seem shorter. It was too early for me, but I saw people with Bloody Mary's that looked divine. The DJ was a very fun addition to the brunch experience and added to the lively ambiance. Once we were seated, we were attended to quickly and coffee and a hash monkey was in its way.  Don't miss out on trying the monkey.  For a main course we ordered the hash- two had the carnitas hash and one had the smoked salmon hash. Heavenly! So many flavors and presented wonderfully in a cast iron pan. I don't know how it could have been better.  The hashes are all around $15 but are really two meals in one. I left with a take home bag.  Just scrumptious!"}
{"text":"An absolute must! I am a big breakfast fan. Definitely a threat to all breakfast restaurants in Scottsdale. Lemon ricotta pancakes hit it right on the mark. Hot with a wonderful light and citrus flavor. I love Butterfields (biggest reason is the speed of the food) but they matched it here but with more of an upscale flair. Leo (my server) was great. You're missing out if you don't try this place. Prices are more than reasonable."}
{"text":"We go to Hash Kitchen at least once a week!  The staff is amazing!  We especially love Bonnie and Lorna!  It is always a good time and every single item on the menu is DELICIOUS!  Bloody Mary's, Mimosas, EVERYTHING!  Super fun and lively atmosphere!  This is our #1 go to place!"}
{"text":"Oh my god! I am floored by this establishment.  It is bright and airy with Windows surrounding the building. The energy is incredibly upbeat and exciting. We were greeted by the owner, Bonnie and she is the most darling woman. She brought in a DJ and has been dancing around the restaurant, she is extremely personable and you can tell her passion for good food, friendly staff and excellent service is What makes this place thrive. Aside from the wonderful entertainment and the energetic atmosphere, the food is incredible. Unique and packed with flavor you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. The coffee is hot and fresh, the Mimosa flight is unique and the bloody Mary bar is the stuff dreams are made of."}
{"text":"The vibe here is HILARIOUS!!!!!  Loud DJ music during breakfast?  I guess people don't enjoy their friends anymore and don't care to have conversations with one another.  The Host was a stuck up brat.  Their attitude is very much \"we don't have to be nice,  we are busy and don't need your business.\"  Eventually,  you will regret that snotty @ss attitude.  
We were going to stay and requested to sit outside because weather was nice and we wanted to be able to HEAR each other because we LIKE each other and enjoy chit chatting without losing our voices.  I get the loud music during happy hour on a Friday night but this just made the restaurant look like it was trying too hard to be something cutting edge.  LAME.
Anywho, we left before getting seated.  The patio looked crazy jammed with no breathing room.  We went to SOL Mexican Cocina for their brunch and it was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Super sweet staff from the moment you walk in the door who create a fun experience. The Bloody Mary bar is awesome and the food is fantastic. This is by far our favorite breakfast spot in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this restaurant. If you are looking for a place to converse, this is not it. Very loud, very crowded, and the food is just so so. I don't know why they call it a hash kitchen. They don't have true hash on the menu. It is disguised as very small potatoes that are brown that they pile other ingredients on top of. I will say that the Bloody Mary bar was a great idea, but only one bartender and a very slow, long line to wait in to receive one."}
{"text":"This place has a great ambience. They even have a DJ during busy weekend brunch hours. Extra bonus- strong, flavorful coffee! Although we didn't try it, they have an extensive, impressive Bloody Mary bar. Husband tried the house sangria and said it was the perfect blend of sweet and strong. 

In terms of food, so many delicious looking options. If you like seafood try their lump crab frittata or lump crab sweet potato hash -- both were excellent. We also split a 1/2 order of apple pie pancakes and they were delicious. A 1/2 order comes with two large pancakes and is plenty, especially if you just want a taste of sweet along with your full savory meal. 

If you're looking for a fun brunch environment this is your spot. Do expect a wait during the busy brunch hours."}
{"text":"We zoomed in after our Taliesin West tour to discover a Coma inducing foodie alert. I am not a breakfast food kind of girl and was convinced I would get lunch today. Saw the AZ Breakfast Week specials and decided to eat outside the box. 

The restaurant itself is beautifully arranged and built. Bright, well lit, open and airy. Super mod design with an air of \"cool digs.\" 

The Az Breakfast Week special was 15 dollars which included a Mimosa, a Cannoli donut, 
( What?????? A Cannoli donut. I know right? ) and a choice between 4 entree choices. I went with the banana french toast. Seriously, I could not even come close to eating all this food. It came home and made three meals for me. I also had a very good cup of coffee. 

The food was pretty delish. We shared at our table so I was able to taste the Chicken and Waffles and the Oreo Pancakes. All the dishes were great. They have a large menu of hash skillets that look amazing. Hash kitchen has a lunch menu too. 

I seriously almost fell asleep on the long drive home thinking to myself, \"Thank God this place is not near my house.\" Then it dawned on me. I never got my Cannoli donut. Waaaaaaa???? And believe it or not, I was almost tempted to drive back the 20 miles to get it. Ha! 

Justin, our server was amazing, except he forgot my donut. However, I will not hold that against him. You think I would learn to speak up better being a NY gal who loves Cannoli. Honestly, there was  so much food it slipped my mind, no small feat. The manager/owner from Brooklyn, sorry I did not get her name, was also very delightful. She stopped by our table a few times. 

We had no wait time being a Friday at noonish. However, I was forewarned, and so are you, this place is super packed on the weekends."}
{"text":"Bonnie was amazing! The atmosphere was super energetic and the music was great! The food was beyond and the drinks were the topping on the cake! There was a bit of a wait but it's expected especially given the uniqueness of the restaurant! Everyone was super friendly and accommodating to any request that we had in regards to our food, seating, and drink choices. Bonnie (whom I assume is the owner) was awesome! Super fabulous and super welcoming and kind! She constantly came by to make sure we were having a good time seeing as we were visiting from Rhode Island and she definitely knew how to get down to the music the DJ played! YES, THEY HAD A LIVE DJ, it was amazing. Whenever I visit again I'm definitely going to stop by and have some amazing breakfast and drinks and i can count on Bonnie to turn up and have a great time! Well done!"}
{"text":"In the Gainey Ranch Shops at the previous Cuttlefish location. Good size restaurant and vertical modern building. The old oyster bar from Cuttlefish with the scooter seats are transformed into a Bloody Mary Bar.

Had the Build Your Own Scramble with Chorizo, Italian Sausage and Mushrooms which was excellent. It came with a small container of hash browns and a home made biscuit.  Everything was excellent,  the chorizo was just right not to hot but with enough kick to give it flavor.  The mushrooms were plentiful and the Italian Sausage was very good. The Hash Browns were good and the home made biscuit was fresh and soft.

The disk jockey playing the music was different in a breakfast / lunch place. Was good to liven up the place but at times was difficult to hear the other person talk.

The service  was excellent as our waiter Ryan made sure everything was right and for having a party of 14 he handled every need without an issue. 

Was also a nice touch that the owner came by to talk with us.

Will be back to try the lunch menu and especially the burgers that looked very good on the menu"}
{"text":"Arrived on a Saturday for breakfast / lunch at 12:00 pm and had a 10 minute wait, was given a buzzer and waited on Adirondack chairs in front.

At the front there is a DJ playing music, almost too loud where you can not hear each other talk. Love the high energy vibe but let the music level be background music rather than drown out the table conversation.

We ordered the Make Your Own Scramble with bacon, Italian Sausage and Mushrooms, Crab Lump Egg Benedict and the Corn Beef Hash Griddle. All dishes were good and prepared well.

The bar is interesting where half of it is inside and the other half sits outside along the wall.

The service is excellent and the food is good. So many breakfast restaurants in the area that have risen within the past year. We ate an the location in Gainey Ranch and was real impressed then, overall I think I had a better experience at the Gainey Ranch location."}
{"text":"ordered the chicken and waffle, belgian style of course. waiter recommended that we go with a couple of bottles of champagne instead of the mimosa flights offered on the menu - offers you the opportunity to mix 'em as strong as you like . maple syrup mixed with tabasco and butter; can't be beat."}
{"text":"First and foremost the service was great and I highly appreciate a good waiter or waitress. We came here with a party of 8 and they were very accommodating to that. We all were in awe of their lavish menu and everything on Yelp looked so good. I personally ended up going with the build your own Bloody Mary to start. Now I'm going to be very critical on this because I personally, make the best bloody Mary's (no joke you'll have to try). So the build your own Bloody Mary was being held to very high standards. I went with cucumber vodka (so good), their standard mix that is made in house and from their I did everything on my own. I got pickled okra, pickled celery which was spicy, I also got pickles, bacon, olives, lines and lemons. I added pickle juice and olive juice to it as well. Ahhhhh so good.

Now as for breakfast, my brother in law and I split a chorizo burrito (so good) and the chicken and waffles. I'm from SoCal and chorizo burritos are my jam. But this burrito was SOOO GOOD! I was really happy about that. The chicken and waffles blew my mind though. The chicken was seasoned really well and the waffle had bits of bacon in it. Yes I said it, bacon!!!! What impressed me the most was the waffle. It was fluffy and soft through out and most of the time you get a Belgian waffle like that it gets hard and crunchy on the outside. But not these! 

Amazing time at Hash!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Boring Benny, a traditional eggs Benedict served with a side of fried small square potatoes. It was a plainer offering than some of the more exotic menu items, but it was very good with a tasty hollandaise sauce. A good value for under ten bucks. A cheerful, clean decor, and even though there were a lot of diners, the noise level was not bothersome and was relatively low. The Bloody Mary looked amazing, but saved for another visit by me."}
{"text":"Holy waffles, this place is good!  While going on a staycation in Scottsdale, we came to this place for breakfast and the food was phenomenal.  We definitely got more than we needed and that is a lesson for us to know the size of our eyes to our stomach.  I wish it was closer to us because we would go here more often.  Great food, great people, great time."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite brunch spots! I have been to the one on Frank Lloyd Wright & Gainey ranch. The atmosphere is great, they bring a DJ in on the weekends, the food is delicious, and the Bloody Mary bar is always a good time!"}
{"text":"The Hash Kitchen is a nicely appointed, modern restaurant featuring great food. I love the decor and look of the resturant as well as the location with plenty of parking adjacent, as it is in the Shops at Gainey Ranch Plaza. 

The filling breakfast I had here on my last day visiting Scottsdale was spectacular. I had a Rumchata coffee drink and it was delightful. My skillet breakfast concoction with biscuit was trey deliciosa. 

Service was great and efficient. I enjoy that the Hash Kitchen has local owners who also own (other concept) restaurants in the city. Check out the pictures of the famous customers that have been there by the host podium (Phelps, etc.) I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot - delicious food (especially the Coconut Almond French Toast). If you love spicy try the Bloody Mary with bacon infused vodka - extra spicy!!"}
{"text":"Fun Breakfast spot! Food was fantastic, and the Bloody Mary Bar is insane with endless options. The live DJ is a cool addition to the already nice atmosphere! Will continue to recommend this place, and will absolutely return ourselves :)"}
