{"text":"I was ecstatic a few years back when we finally got a Chipotle in Mentor.....  I have to say. I'm changing my tune. I love this little burrito bar on the lake. It's not a chain. I enjoyed interacting with one of the owners. He was awesome! He helped me decide what to order. And happily, I discovered, the food was even better than I could've anticipated.   The steak won me over....and I'm picky! I also loved the buffalo chicken. After sampling it...I was an instant fan. The sweet pineapple salsa took the prize...and I'm hooked! Just like that."}
{"text":"Great place.  In my opinion the meat is much better here than at their competitors.  Not as many fatty pieces.  Friendly staff and quick service.  It is also pretty easy to find coupons too!  I have only been there once but will definitely go again.  You should check it out."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. This place is better than Chipotle. Honestly. Everything is very fresh. Everything is made to order.  Nothing fancy, they stick to the basics but understand the importance of quality food.  It's incredible! The tortilla is super soft, fresh meat, fresh veggies...all ingredients incorporate well together.  This place will never disappoint you.  AND won't make your stomach hurt like Chipotle does EVERYTIME!  A must try!"}
{"text":"Went here because I needed a change from chipotle. Staff is very friendly but the food just tasted like family taco night. Save your money and make this food yourself."}
{"text":"this has to be my favorite burrito spot great taste fast friendly service. on Friday nights they have the best bacon wrapped jalapeno stuffed with dream cheese. try the burrito loco style"}
{"text":"Discovered this place thanks to yelp! So glad I did. Really good food. The meat is way better quality than chipotle and the ingredients seem fresher in my opinion. The portions are large!"}
{"text":"Totally shocked by the high reviews on this place. The service here is so slow, I've actually walked out twice. Food is average, but service is comically slow. I'm a sucker for a decent burrito, but can't rationalize waiting 10 min to get my food with one person in front of me in line. Burrito Loco; your staff is killing you."}
{"text":"So worth the drive from Perry.  Puts chipotle to sham.  Glad my daughter wanted to come here"}
{"text":"Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Burrito Loco is straight-up awesome.  I go there at least once per week for lunch, and again for dinner.  Take everything you like about Chipotle, Qdoba, and Moe's, and imagine it ten times better.  That's Burrito Loco.  You know how you go to the other places and its all the same items?  Well, Burrito Loco has all that stuff and more.  They have three different kinds of chicken, ground beef, real steak, carnitas, and chorizo.  They have this awesome, flaming hot pineapple salsa.  And Loco Sauce.  The loco sauce is what makes it.  And on Friday nights they serve bacon wrapped, grilled jalapeno poppers stuffed with that Mexican white cheese.  Dude.  They do burritos, bowls, salads, quesadillas, and tacos.  All of them are great.  And they also have this challenge where they make a burrito the size of a football and you shove it down your gullet.  Pretty awesome.  It's cheap, and you get a ton of food.  Good food.  Loco good food.  Go eat there.  Then go back and eat again the next day.  http://memegenerator.net/instance2/3993743"}
{"text":"This was our first time going to Burrito Loco and we'll be back!  I usually go to Chipotle as my go-to burrito/taco place, but I wanted a change. I used Yelp to find this gem. The service is great and they prepare the food in front of you. The food was flavorful and the portions are large. We also liked the warm chips."}
{"text":"Better than chipotle. The teryaki chicken is delicious.   They have raised the prices 3 times since opening which sucks... but I continue to go back since its a local shop."}
{"text":"Loved it. Chicken teriyaki was amazing.   You have them prepare it any way you'd like it.  Beans, rice, fajitas etc. all were super fresh.  I didn't have the steak but apparently they prepare it fresh to order. Will have to try that next time.   If they franchise I want one!!"}
{"text":"Solid competition for Chipotle. They have more ingredient choices, but are slightly more expensive. I ordered a bowl with Siracha chicken, guacamole, & pineapples, along with various filler ingredients such as rice, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. This along with a drink was 11.00$. Having said that the bowl was easily a third larger than Chipotle and left me thinking I needed someone to share it with. My only complaint is a minor one. The freshly brewed iced tea was indeed freshly brewed, but it was hot. Easily solved by adding ice. Overall flavors and ingredients pop nicely and the staff seemed helpful and knowledgeable. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I love this place! I go 2-3 times a week. Everything is fresh and the staff is super friendly. Also if you're lucky enough to go when they have the grilled poppers, don't even think about it... ORDER THEM!! Haha!"}
{"text":"Portions are huge everything is fresh, chips and salsa are amazing. Thank god for something other then chipotle!!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, LOVE!!!  This place is amazing! After several unhappy stops at Chipotle, we discovered this wonderful place around the corner. The employees are always nice and respectful and it's peaceful inside.   My go-to is usually a chicken bowl, rice and beans on the side (for the kids), lettuce, cheese, guac, pico, verde, pineapple, and loco sauce on the side. The guac is always fresh and yummy. Did I mention the pineapple?? AMAZING SALSA!!! The chicken is always moist, not gristly (been a problem at Chipotle lately). I haven't tried the steak yet but the husband swears by it.   Give it up for the local store- far and above better than Chipotle!!"}
{"text":"Was in town visiting some friends and we were going to go to Chipolte.  They recommended we try this little gem.  It is tucked away in Mentor-On-The-Lake at the end of a small shopping center.  I ordered the burrito bowl with steak and a side of chips and queso.  The steak was cooked to order, which unlike Chipolte is amazing!  I ordered my steak medium and got it medium.  They were not overly salty and had a great selection of toppings for the burritos.  They even have brown and white rices.  I definitely will be back here over chipotle any time I am in town!!  So good!!!"}
{"text":"To my dismay, I took off a star. We got nachos and burritos on Friday night, and everything is so laden with salt, it's almost inedible. I love salty things and this was too much. I'm so bummed - hopefully it's just a one off and things will be less salty? However it'll take a lot for me to come back here."}
{"text":"Update...food is still great but if you go on a hot day don't expect to be able to eat in the restaurant. Spoke to the owner because this happened multiple times and today myself and 2 other customers decided against eating here. I thought about it and decided that I wanted to let them know. The owner.suggested I get the food to go but...\"you don't need to tell us it's hot! We know it's hot!\"   Maybe my last trip here since its out of my way. Unfortunately not a good day for customer service. Particularly when I was letting them know, politely, they were losing business.   Hasta la vista!"}
{"text":"Wow; the Yelp reviews were right; this place is pretty awesome.  Staff was very patient with us; we've been to the unnamed somewhat similar place before so we knew the routine but not all the options the chain place doesn't have.  Staff recommended the LOCO burrito with chorizo; outstanding & very fresh.  Will be back when we're in the area!!"}
{"text":"It seems this place has been redone recently as I is nowhere as good as my previous experience. The chicken in my burrito was extremely dry and the black beans seemed a bit off. Overall  burrito was very unsatisfying and the staff was not very helpful or friendly."}
{"text":"Not seeing what the hype is about from previous posters. The food was adequate and we didn't even finish it all."}
{"text":"Visited Burrito Loco for the first time, yesterday. Wow, wow, wow!  I shant be going to the \"other burrito restaurants\"   anymore now that I know about this little gem!  I enjoyed a burrito with chicken and my girlfriend enjoyed the burrito bowl with teriyaki chicken.  She had me try a piece of the teriyaki chicken and let me tell you, I may be getting that in my burrito the next time! Everything was so fresh! The veggies are so colourful and beautiful.   Absolutely the best of all burrito places in Mentor, in my opinion.  Very clean, cute dining area!  Burrito Loco is on Andrews Rd, just past the Autozone at the northernmost end of the little strip plaza.  It's a shame it's sort of hidden in this spot. It's Just... So... Good! Try it, then let others know about it.  I want to make sure this place sticks around for a long time!  Thank you, Burrito Loco!. See you again soon!"}
{"text":"11/24-Updated review: Looks like the owner actually reads yelp reviews. Went here again...no more 'mexican cheese in a bag'...replaced now with a much better white cheddar/jack. Also, their chicken had more seasoning and a good kick to it. Definitely has raised the bar. Their roasted red pepper queso cheese is awesome. I'm officially a fan now and done with chipotle!"}
{"text":"I'll never go to Chipotles again...period. This place is awesome. Not only are the ingredients fresh, they are well portioned. I usually order half Chorizo and half chicken. The workers never give me any hassle about special requests. Oh yeah.....the workers are THE BEST! They actually take their time and BUILD your bowl or burrito...they don't just throw sh**t around like they're trying to paint in the style of Jackson Pollock.  I totally recommend this place....come in and witness these artists at work!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Portion sizes are good but varies by employee. The green salsa is amazing!"}
{"text":"I suspect this place is called Burrito Loco because you'd have to be loco (\"crazy,\" in Spanish) to think this was a good burrito.   First, they're very stingy with the fillings. This might be because the tortillas are rather small, so overstuffing would likely lead to burrito explosion when grilled. Or, it just might be that the place is owned by Scrooge McDuck Gonzalez. Either way, it's a skimpily filled burrito.  Second, the meat is not that great. On my first try, I had the chicken, which was stewed but dry. Blech. I wised up and went with a plain bean-rice-and-cheese combo, which was better.   On the up side, I do like that they \"grill\" their burritos on a panini press. It makes the tortilla all nice and crisp on the outside (though on my last visit, the burrito was grilled a little too long and ended up a scosh on the burnt side. Alas.)  If it weren't the only burrito place within a stone's throw of my apartment, I wouldn't come here. But seeing as that there is a lack of quick burrito options in my 'hood, I'll be back, but I won't expect to be wowed by the experience."}
{"text":"This is a gem that I am happy to go back to any time the people working here are always helpful and happy that's just a plus to the food that I find better then the fast food like restaurant Chipotle if u are looking for good Mexican food and a good price and a good amount for your money you have found it this is something that everyone needs to try"}
{"text":"Two times we had a large order and two times they forgot something in the order.  Food is good and generous but service stinks!"}
{"text":"Had a bad experience with a carnitas quesadilla - employee did not drain the meat and it came out soggy, basically a mess which was not enjoyable to try and eat.    After expressing my discontent on yelp, one of the owners quickly reached out to me to try and solve the problem. She has taken my experience into consideration and has offered me a complimentary meal as a make-up.  Great to see owners/mgmt who are concerned with product and customer satisfaction. I am hoping that my next meal here will be enjoyable!"}
{"text":"was just there and ok the burrito was good but the person serving me seemed very miserable and unhappy and I almost felt like just leaving  there is nothing worse than having an unhappy person waiting on you"}
{"text":"This is a 3rd review confirming that Burrito Loco is GOOD but nothing special.  I had a small chicken burrito which was $6 with tax. You choose your toppings and have a choice between white or whole wheat wrap. They grill it like a panini and hand it over.  Quick and cheap but nothing special. Wasn't especially tasty but didn't taste bad either. Sort of like something you could/would make yourself at home.  Only other thing I have to add was that the owner was very friendly and went out of his way to ensure I was enjoying my food."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times.  My husband and I like it better than Chipotle.  The steak is made to order.  Who can ask for more? Great prices and the staff is always so friendly.  We have tried the bowls, wraps, chips. & salsa.  All excellent!!!  This place is a hidden gem.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give this place a shot because we live ridiculously close and neither of us wanted to drive to Chipotle. Man am I glad we did! Delicious food, great prices, friendly service. I highly recommend trying this place out if you're in the neighborhood. I really hope they're here to stay!"}
{"text":"This new burrito place took over an old Quiznos location.  Basically everything inside is still Quiznos, just now they sell burritos.  They even still have the Quiznos neon \"TOASTY!\" sign hanging in the window.    On first glance behind the cash register you might think they sell doughnuts because there is a Tim Horton's oven sitting on the counter, but sadly you cannot order a cruller.  They sell a small and large size burrito here with your choice of fillings; steak, chicken, veggie, bean & cheese, and more.  They pack the tortillas full but I found they were a little chintzy on the cheese and meat.   A bonus here is that they don't charge extra for guac.  Their prices are just under $6 for a small and up to $10 for a large.  They have other food on the menu like quesadillas and churros also.    Overall I'd say this is a good place for lunch if you are working or shopping in the area, but don't make a special trip."}
{"text":"I thought it was an amazing place.  It had great food.  I always get chicken tacos, but the steak was so good... I might be switching.  Definitely a place worth eating at."}
{"text":"Food wise this is a 5 star review. This was my first time here and I wasn't sure of all the options or what I'd like to put on my burrito. I'd say next time I'd like it even more because I'd put more of certain things on, such as salsas, loco sauce, and peppers. Flavor-wise, this is better than the local branches of chipotle. Chipotle is one of my favorite places but at least in mentor the flavor recently has been dulled - not sure why.   There was no lack of flavor here. I got chicken and it was juicy and flavorful. The amount of meat and veggies put onto the burrito was a lot also. Certainly comparable to a chipotle burrito in size. The price was about equal. The real difference for me was the options they offer. I like spice and while I get all the salsa at chipotle, it still isn't hot for me. At burrito loco, I got fresh jalapeno peppers and other sauces which was great.   The only issue I had was the staff. The manager, a lady with a arm sleeve of tattoos, looked like she hated being there. She didn't help with anything either while I was there, which although there was only 1 person in front of me, was about 5 minutes. The other three employees were teens - 2 boys and a girl. The only want to even crack a smile was the girl and it was a small one. Personally, I don't care too much about the staff - I'm there for the food. But for a first impression, walking in and the entire staff looking like they didn't want to be there was a turn off before I even ordered.   For the reason of staff alone, this is a 4 star place. Overall, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a whim, only 1 person working in the store and it took 25 minutes to get a burrito. The steak was cooked fresh which is what took so long, the rice and other ingredients were way too watery, and by the time I got to the eating part meant the tortilla was falling apart.   The poor guy behind the counter was working his butt off but I don't know how you only staff 1 person at 1pm on a weekday."}
{"text":"Popped into Burrito Loco for lunch today and I completely agree with Chris P's review. This place looks exactly like a Subway or Quizo's except they serve Burritos and Quesadillas.  Prices are reasonable and the burritos are a good size, the large thoroughly filled me up for lunch. I went for a large vegetarian burrito ($6.59) which came with bean, cheese, guacamole, salsa, sour cream, hot sauce, and various vegetables. The burrito was good, certainly better than a lot of the places I've been to, but not nearly as flavourful as Burrito Boys/Banditos. If you like things spicy I'd ask for extra hot sauce as the default amount doesn't give much fire.  I work in the area and I'll likely go back to Burrito Loco for lunch but, as Chris P said, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"What a fantastic business. Give back to the community and they will give back to you. Their generosity has made my family customers for life. Luckily is already one of our favorite restaurants. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I gotta say this place is on par or better then Chipotle. They do offer more options and queso sauce."}
{"text":"CLOSED  Toronto's become a tough tortilla town. One of the last casualties of 2010 (or perhaps one of the first of 2011), Burrito Loco has rolled off to that taqueria in the sky. It was easy to lose Burrito Loco in the late-decade Burrito boom which has seen the rise of chains big and small.   Probably best known as that funny, repurposed Quiznos on the ground floor of a condo; Burrito Loco the place that you pass by on your way to coffee at Timothys, or more exciting (or at least branded) options further East.   Inside, it was an expression of found commerce. An abandoned turn-key operation, the sandwich shop remained mostly intact. New, temporary signage that never made it's way to menu-board permanence; a toaster that left burrito wraps blistered and not unpleasantly charred; the condiment bar featuring salsas instead of italian red-hots.   The food was forgettable. A large chicken burrito proved heavy on the rice and light on stringy fowl. Lukewarm beans, reasonably fresh toppings and a light dusting of pre-shredded cheese finished things off. The finished product was served at an odd combination of temperatures. The outer layers were blistering hot from the burrito-mobile conveyor. Inside, things cooled off considerably.  Apart from the cute counter help, there was nothing to draw me back. Evidently, a man's heart may be accessed through his stomach, but the reverse does not hold true."}
{"text":"Ok, if you haven't checked this place out yet your really missing out!  I have been here a number of times..each time it's just as good as the last.  My go to items is a chicken fajita bowl with brown rice.   I did try the buffalo chicken bowl...way tooooooooo spicy even for my husband who is a quarter Puerto Rican...   Take a chance, it's better then Chipotle!"}
{"text":"First of All, Support Local Business! This is one of the best way you can do this! While for those who like to stick to the \"downtown\" Mentor scene, I'm telling you, take the 8 extra minutes and pass Chipotle continue down 306 and find this place. I love that there is 2 choices for chicken - both great. the steak is cooked to order - what other place does that? The Quesos (yes, plural) are both excellent. It has caused my daughter (who doesn't like cheese, to exclaim,\"I love queso!\" The other hidden gems lie in a tropical fruit, pineapple. John's Pineapple salsa is worth the drive, hands down. The haberno pineapple salsa is great for those who like hot with a hint of sweet. Ingrediants are always fresh and portions are abundant. You'll be happy you took a chance."}
{"text":"An OK place. More variety in the toppings than, say, Chipotle, and it's possible to stuff a wider variety of them into your bowl or burrito. The end result is at least as large as the chains, but realize that you're probably getting a bit less of each individual ingredient, or at least it seems that way to me.  The rice is less sticky than in some other places, which results in a more watery, less dense final product. I prefer the denser style, myself.  Guacamole is great, very tasty with an edge of spiciness. Chips are thin, taste slightly cardboardy after the first few. Not out of the norm, but my preference is a thicker chip that brings a more pronounced corn flavor.  I've had the chicken bowls twice. Meat is tasty, but I suspect hardcore Chipotle fans would want to order double meat automatically here.  Some of the comments above no doubt reflect less use of salt than the chains. That's not a bad thing."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing. My whole family loves it. We have it once a week and it's not even near where we live. It's worth a little extra drive. The steak is amazing and cooked to order. I highly recommend. Even my 2 year olds love it."}
{"text":"Only the best burrito joint ever! Love the place. Wish there were more of them. Good fresh ingredients. Great food."}
