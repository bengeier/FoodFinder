{"text":"Disappointing. Went here for lunch to try it out and was suprised at how small the portion size was. Ordered a bowl of tonkatsu broth ramen with the shashu(pork belly) with green onion and a piece of seaweed paper (nothing extra, though i debated getting an extra piece of pork for $2.95) The broth had no flavour, lacking in the pork taste, and the amount of noodles was disappointing. Other than the egg being cooked alright, the place was clean and that I got a cup of hot tea, I sadly won't be going back. For the amount this cost ($17 including tax and tip) there are better options in other parts of Montreal for a great bowl of Ramen for my money."}
{"text":"Solid ramen bowl.

I chose the shoyu (clear) broth with the pork belly and was not disappointed.

From the extra I chose (egg, corn) none really worth it. Half an egg is 0.75$, the corn was 0,75$ for probably 1/5 of a cup, or a small handful. 

Knowing that one full egg is 0,25$ (3$ carton) and a can of corn is around 1$. It's a bit high, the extra 1.95$ for noodle, I totally understand because it's labor intensive, same for broth. But dumping corn from a can, that's not.

The sad thing is, I think the soup needs the corn. It adds just a little bit of crunch and sweetness that balance well the broth. 

I know it's ridiculous to pick for 75 cents, but I feel kind of ripped because I know I could get a full can of corn for that price.

If they would just give me 1/3 to 1/2 of a cup of corn, that would be well worth it.

I might go back and haggle for more corn."}
