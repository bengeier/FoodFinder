{"text":"The homemade cookies are delicious, and so are the Thrifty ice cream; but I just want more variety in dessert."}
{"text":"So yummy! Cookies are so soft. Ice cream is to die for! Customer service was great too. We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Fresh baked cookies and Thrifty Ice cream"}
{"text":"The home made cookies were absolutely perfect. The Thrifty ice cream was delicious.Together the sandwich was amazing. Great friendly staff. Love this place."}
{"text":"Came in with my gf and her friend.   They had chocolate chip cookie  with salted caramel ic. Her friend said wow repeatedly lol. Must've been really good. My gf had the strawberry and cream ic. Polished that off, I enjoyed the lemon sorbet , could've been a tad more tart for my liking but the softness and quality was superb. Definitely going back for seconds soon."}
{"text":"I just love me some Thrifty Ice Cream and to top it all off you get to pick your own cookies to make an ice cream sandwich. I did not know what I wanted because there was so many flavors to choose from and I wasn't sure what cookie I wanted to try since I love me some cookies especially with any ice cream to chose from. I went with the chocolate malt ice cream with white chocolate chip cookie. It was amazing!   This place is a definite must try if you love some ice cream and cookies. They also have a cookie shake!"}
{"text":"Da Bomb. If you like cookies and ice cream this is your SPOT I promise you.    The prices are pretty fair for 2 cookies and a big scoop of ice cream $3 and maybe some change.   This little place is amazing. They have the best cookies all hand made of course and thrifty ice cream which is pretty goodi in my opinion.   A staple in my visits to sweet addiction are literally one of the best cookies I have ever had in my life! I am not joking when I say the Mint chocolate chip cookie from here is absolutlely amazing! Here is the deal it's made with \"andes mints\" and other deliciousesnous and I mave have just made that word up for those cookies I think.   My fave: Mint chocolate chip cookies with mint chocolate chip ice cream cookie sandwich. but lately I have been getting one mint chip and one M&M cookie.  m          m m m m mmm mm I was there last night. so good.    The Vegas Villain"}
{"text":"Cookies are freshly baked and quite tasty! ice cream is good because its thrifty's but nothing special!"}
{"text":"Can't beat their specials, especially the $2 ice cream sandwiches on Tuesdays! The cookies fresh out the oven are just amazing. For the ice cream sandwiches, I like the brownie chocolate cookies with mint ice cream and my husband gets macadamia nut and/or m&m cookies with strawberry shortcake ice cream. The strawberry shortcake shake is also a fav!"}
{"text":"Wowzers...this place is delicious! I tried a snickerdoodle cookie with birthday cake ice cream and wished I had room for about 5 more, but just one is almost too much! The cookie by itself would have been awesome, great flavor and very soft. Then you add in the birthday cake ice cream, oh yeah! A great find for my sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Awwwesoome! Nice and simple. Someone had a the great idea to take two things that everyone loves-homemade cookies and Thrifty Ice Cream and put them together in sweet yummy goodness!  We had never heard of this place but tried it out since I had a coupon for it. My daughter and I were out shopping and decided to give it a try (even though we hadn't even had dinner yet!). We are hooked! It's a small little \"ice cream shop\" with only one kid behind the counter, but the quality of the desserts and the customer service were both something to write home about! The prices were very fair too.  I thought i would be paying much more for the ice cream sandwich delights that we enjoyed.   Definitely fans! We had such a hard time trying to pick out which cookies and which ice cream flavors we wanted to use for our \"sandwich\", but we both finally came up with something we like. They even have an ice cream float that is probably just as good! Maybe next time! :)"}
{"text":"I have to admit this place won my heart. The place is just new and has a great idea. Cookies + Ice cream= happiness for me. Bringing back thrifty ice cream was great for drawing my attention. They had many original flavors like birthday cake and circus animal cracker. However not every thing was great, the cookies were mediocre making the ice cream cookie sandwich less than perfection. On the other hand the lady who helped was very bubbly and had a great personality."}
{"text":"I tried so hard not to go here!  I even changed my mind after passing it on my way home telling myself the last thing I needed to eat was an ice cream sandwich filled with Thriftys ice cream ( my favorite by the way).    So, I drive home, pulled into the driveway and proceeded to start looking at all the awesome pics on yelp and what do you think happened next?   You guessed it!  I started the car right up and drove back and Im glad I did!  The cookies they used were perfectly soft and chewy.  I got one brownie and one snickerdoodle cookie with Black Cherry icecream  in the middle.  On a beautiful day like yesterday it was totally worth it!!!  BTW-the staff was helpful and the place was clean-five stars!"}
{"text":"Omg! This place is soooo bomb! They have a special on Tuesdays 2.50 for an ice cream sandwich. Fresh cookies! My first stop when i visit family in town."}
{"text":"Neat place! Brownie cookie with chocolate macadamia nut was perfect to satisfy my sweet tooth! Got 50 cents off with the online check in!"}
{"text":"When I heard about this place my first thought was AHHHHHHHH ICE CREAM SANDWICHES. Being a big fan of dessert I felt this was an appropriate reaction to finding out that there was a dessert shop that just made just ice cream sandwiches. So after I calmed down I made haste to this magical place.  I had tuxedo cookies (Regular and white chocolate chips) with birthday cake ice cream. It was everything I wanted and more. The cookie had the perfect amount of firmness so it was easy to eat and held the sandwich together. The ice cream is of the thrifty variety.  Plus if you check in on yelp you get a discount which makes it even better. The lack of the 5th star is because the person I was with ordered chocolate chip cookies that ended up being rock hard which was sad for them.    I'll work for cookies.......and ice cream"}
{"text":"I love ice cream. I love cookies. Ice cream + cookies = love? Sad to say, nope! :(  A part of me feels bad because I have been to other ice cream cookie sandwich places that have executed this idea very well. I've been to Sweet Addiction few times. Two of those visits, I tried the ice cream cookie sandwiches that everyone has been raving about. Um, why are the cookies hard?? I tried them at night & mid afternoon - same result. You can't say that the cookies get hard because of the cold ice cream because the other places I've been to (Diddy Riese for example), their cookies are fresh, soft & chewy.   The thing I do like is that they have Thrifty ice cream! I will still go here because of that - just no more ice cream cookie sandwiches."}
{"text":"The cookies are delicious and the thrifty ice cream is always fabulous! Such a great idea for an ice cream shop! Love it!"}
{"text":"I would always drive passed Sweet addictions and notice their eye catching sign. I'm not big on ice cream so I never really thought twice about stopping, but one day I decided to give it a try. I soon found out that they sold cookies, and not just cookies but they were homemade! All of the cookies were amazing I tried one of each. They even have gluten free which I thought was very cool."}
{"text":"Friendly employees who are very pleasant.  But the extra charge for cones is ridiculous.  Nobody charges for a plain cones"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place for dessert!  It always takes us forever to order with so many combinations available.  We try to get something different each time!  There cookie sandwich is awesome!  We were there just the other day and the guy behind us ordered 2 different cookies!!  I hadn't even thought of doing this!!  So next time we go I will be trying it out with 2 different cookies!!!  I can't wait!!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! so delish this place is awesome! I had the GLUTEN FREE peanut butter cookie sandwich with GLUTEN FREE vanilla ice cream, it was fabulous! By far the best gluten free cookie that I have had. The Peanut Butter Cookies were soo soft  and thick I will definatly be going back!!! Great prices also!!!"}
{"text":"Today 11/09/2013 I stopped for the first time with my two kids for ice cream. The kids like it they have some sample tests and they loved it. I'll definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"This place has amazing cookies, thrifty ice cream and great service.  The cookies were so good, I'll probably just skip the ice cream next time and get cookies and milk!  The peanut butter cookie was the best I've ever had.  It has the perfect ratio of sweet and salty.  Don't let the \"gluten free\" moniker scare you, it was the best part of my sandwich.  I also LOVE that it is about half the price of big chain ice cream stores, with better quality and I'm supporting a small, local business."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars, but I cannot. I will go as high as 3.5.  With that being said, I really wanted to like this place. I mean who doesn't love cookies & ice cream? First of all, it is a great concept. 2nd of all, Thrifty Ice cream! 3rd of all, I wish it were a Diddy Riese Cookies instead :P  Upon walking inside, it smells AMAZING! & the decor is kind of cute, but that's where it all ended for me. Lol, the jokes on me though, because I bought 3 Groupons for this place :P 1 down & 2 to go. I got a cookie sandwich; chocolate brownie ice cream, between oatmeal raisin & chocolate chip cookies. & Taylor T. had Jamocha almond fudge between 2 white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookies. We were both of the opinion that the cookies were mediocre, at best. Well, to be honest, I really did like the oatmeal raisin cookie. However, I can definitely make better cookies than this place. Especially, chocolate chip!  Also, I really didn't like the cookie setup. I feel like they should be put up front, alongside the ice cream. I would just like to see them displayed better, other than up on a shelf. Furthermore, I also wish the cookies were a little more uniform in size. I mean, if you're going to charge 75 cents a cookie, then they should all be the same size, roughly. Unfortunately, my oatmeal raisin cookie was noticeably smaller than my chocolate chip cookie.  Overall, the place is very clean & the staff is very nice. I will at least be back 2 more times, thanks to Groupon. Besides, I do believe in giving second chances. However, if I don't like it; I'm going to open up my own ice cream sandwich places, on my side of town & show them how it should be done ;) After all, it was my idea back in 2007 anyways."}
{"text":"The only reason I give it a 4 and not a 5 is the place is not much to look at but man oh man they have the best cookies. The in house made cookies are everything I want a cookie to be! The girls working inside were doing a stand up job too"}
{"text":"Not being the biggest sweet fan, I do happen to enjoy small amounts of ice cream from time to time. Driving by today we noticed the \"Thrifty Ice Cream\" sign and made some questionable lane changes in order to make it into the parking lot. The owner was a really friendly guy and was very enthusiastic in explaining the concept and the menu. I got my ice cream and my wife enjoyed her Pistachio Ice Cream/Snicker doodle sandwich. The place was very clean and inviting and we will definitely become regulars."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Cookies were fresh and so good! The ice cream was great! The young man who was serving was kind and fast. The ice cream cookies are amazing and a great price. It is a must go to place!"}
{"text":"Sweet addiction  is so delicious.  Tried my first Ice cream shake.  And I loved it. I've  had thrifty ice cream since I was a lil girl.  Now my kids enjoy it."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! My husband and I take our 4 boys here often. Their homemade cookies are consistently awesome and the price is great as well. This place makes me SMILE :)"}
{"text":"What a great idea!  Was in town for a convention and looking for a sweet treat after dinner. Chocolate brownie cookies with mint chocolate chip ice cream. Delicious. The cookies were good and I don't think you can go wrong with Thrifty ice cream. Hoping to go back one more time before I leave town."}
{"text":"Thrifty Ice cream in between two homemade cookies? Yes please. I can only say what everybody else has said about this place, its amazing!! Any place that has thrifty ice cream, wins my heart. But, they make it even better....throwing 2 warm cookies on top and bottom of my scoop is heaven!  My new favorite spot.."}
{"text":"I've been a fanatic about this place since it first opened and have brought numerous different friends and family members to support this local business. I've also talked to the owner a few different times and she was always nice, but the young workers never were friendly. I just went after a date night right before closing, I showed up at about 9:45 (which I get, it's late and they don't want anyone coming) but I felt rushed to leave so I took it Togo. I bragged to my boyfriend about how much he was gonna like it, and he got a cookie sandwich with chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. Halfway into his sandwich he found a blondeish, coarse hair sticking out of the ice cream that didn't even look like human hair. I work in the food industry, so I get things happen, but this piece of hair was literally disgusting and made me wonder how it was inside the ice cream... Questioning if I'll ever return. Super bummed."}
{"text":"YUM! Freshly baked cookies and ice cream brought together in a melty marriage of goodness. What is not to like?? Also, its great that they have two gluten-free cookie choices. That made my friend's day!"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! You can't go wrong with thrifty ice cream and cookies. They have a nice selection of cookies to choose from, and they're all so tastey and fresh. My favorite ice cream cookie sandwich is mint chocolate chip ice cream with tuxedo cookies. Love taking my friends here for their first time."}
{"text":"Cookies and ice cream ... Together? So simple, it makes me mad that I didn't think of it first. The cookies are so good.... Definitely taste homemade. And I've been a fan of thrifty ice cream since childhood. When Rite-aid closed in Vegas I was so sad because I wouldn't be able to get my chocolate malted crunch anymore! I was thrilled when I saw the sweet addiction sign advertising Thrifty. I'll most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The only thing that I had to compare this place to was Diddy Reese from LA, and I have to say it's just as good :)  Completely affordable place for a tasty snack.  I've tried a couple of their flavors and liked their cookies so much that I convinced my office to order cookies for our monthly birthday celebration.  Good ole Thrifty ice cream + the tasty cookies is perfect especially once the weather gets hot."}
{"text":"The best place to get ice cream and cookies! I love coming to this place just for the ice cream. I am a very big fan of thrifty ice cream, for some reason to me it is one of the best ice creams out on the market. To add that to a variety of delicious and soft fresh baked cookies is the best. My favorite is making a custom ice cream sandwich, which consists of a tuxedo cookie on top, chocolate chip ice cream in the middle and the bottom cookie is a snickerdoodle. This mixture for me takes me to paradise and I forget all my worries! Sweet addiction is a must try!"}
{"text":"Swung by the other night for a dessert treat. As always the staff was very friendly and helpful. They had a new green tea ice cream, which was alright, not my cup of tea. I got an ice cream sandwich and the cookies were awesome, super moist and delicious. You really can't go wrong at this place."}
{"text":"Love this place but with the new staff members this seems to be going down a little bit also would like to add i asked for a white chocolate cookie sandwich and they gave me white chocolate macadamia nut cookie now im not allergic to nuts but that is something I'd watch out for, also the cookies aren't tasting like they use to, also the new members  aren't  the friendliest."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  It's cookies and ice cream.  What can go wrong?  They have lots of different ice cream flavors like birthday mix, medieval madness, and other things. My friend and I shared a chocolate mocha crunch (I think) with the tuxedo ice cream which had chocolate chips and white chocolate chips.  I really like thrifty ice cream.  The last time I had it was before they closed down Rite-Aid in Vegas.    You do get $.50 after the a facebook check in.  If you choose just to get the ice cream with the cookie, it's $1.08.  But why would you do that?    The only drawback is that they don't offer any water.  Their water isn't filtered at all, so they don't offer tap water to drink.  You have to purchase water for $1.50.  There is a frozen hot chocolate which I will try one day.  It's only 2.50, so I don't think it'll be better than Serendipity's, but you never know!  This place is definitely worth going again."}
{"text":"I came on a family recommendation. It was so many options. I was a little overwhelmed at first but the person working there was very helpful and patient with me. The ice cream sandwiches are huge. I couldn't finish half. I went with the salted caramel ice cream in between one chocolate chip cookie and a macadamia nut. The price was about $4 per sandwich. The ice cream is thrifty and I guess it's a big deal. I am not familiar with the brand but it is delicious! The cookies were soft and perfect. I would order cookies to go. They also have a large ice cream sandwich for birthdays that I am thinking of trying. All in all I definitely recommend this place. Just remember the portion sizes maybe order just one cookie or share! The only down side was the tables weren't clean and as we were leaving then someone came out the back to clean them all."}
{"text":"Reallllly good cookies. Thrifty ice cream :) Good prices for the quality. I gave 4 stars only because the bathroom was super dirty  and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in quite awhile and the fact that their containers aren't environmentally friendly :("}
{"text":"Very good family owned place! Support this small business and enjoy cookies and ice cream! Great ice cream, great employees, great place!"}
{"text":"This place is fucking amazing. If you come here at the right time, when the cookies are baked fresh its fucking bomb with the ice cream. The portions aren't bad, friendly staff, over all service was pretty good.  Giving it 4 stars cause the last time I was here my cookie wasn't soft and chewy..unfortunately it was hard and not very pleasant but nevertheless the ice cream never fails to fulfill any sweet tooth cravings"}
{"text":"Let's be real. This ice cream sandwich place is really more like \"Serious Addiction.\" I am here more often than my fake diet permits but those with sweet teeth like myself (it's a problem if it extends beyond more than one tooth) sympathize, I'm sure!   For displaced Southern Californians like myself who were privy to the wonders of Diddy Riese, this helps to bring you one step closer to home. The partnership this place has with Thrifty ice cream also means that it's not just #ThrowbackThursday; it's more like #ThrowbackEVERYDAY. They run great promos for those of you that check in at Yelp and have a digital punch card that rewards you with one free ice cream sandwich for every 10 you purchase.   The staff is so sweet (how appropriate!), the decor is adorable, and it's residential locale means that until tourists discover this gem, it's still very Cheers-esque: where everybody knows your name."}
{"text":"Does anyone remember the days when you would walk into a Rite Aid and head straight to the back of the store to get a scoop of Thrifty ice cream? Well now you not only can get Thrifty ice cream but get it between two soft delicious cookies. BOMB!"}
{"text":"Great place to have ice cream!  They sell the best ice cream brand in the world \" Thrifty Ice Cream\" couple that w their amazing cookies and you get the best ice cream sandwich EVER!!!"}
{"text":"My ice cream sandwich was too big to eat like an ice cream sandwich. The cookie was a bit hard and the vanilla was nothing special. I am giving them 4 stars because I tried my Mom's strawberry cheesecake ice cream and it was delicious. I would pass on the cookie sandwich and get ice cream instead."}
{"text":"They had a decent selection of cookies and ice cream. The girls  there were quite helpful, patient and nice. I had the snickerdoodle and caramel ice cream it was the greatest."}
{"text":"Do not want. DO NOT WANT.  I finally checked this place out and it was less than amazing. The cookies didn't look that great so I chose to go with a cone of \"Medievel Madness\" and one white chocolate macadamia nut cookie.  The cookie was cold and uninspiring.  Weirdly, it was also a little salty.  At .90 cents, I wouldn't get this again.  I think Subway's cookies are better than Sweet Addiction's.  That's not a good endorsement.  Also, after eating the ice cream, I was up all night with some really awesome gastrointestinal issues.   Since I made the terrible choice of having ice cream for dinner, I feel like Sweet Addiction may be the culprit. So, yeah, I'm gonna pass on a return visit.  The sad thing is, the ice cream wasn't even that good.  I didn't grow up with Thrifty so I don't have that nostalgic bias that makes me think it's the BEST THING EVER.  To me, it's on the same level as Kroger brand ice cream  If I'm gonna get sick, the ice cream better be amazing!  Boo. Pass."}
{"text":"The cookies are the BOMB! Fresh baked daily.... Don't miss out. All the way from Michigan to get these cookies!"}
{"text":"I usually go to this place about once a month.  A great place every time hence the 4 stars.  But today I went in to get a shake.  No hi , Hello,  anything.  Just an angry blonde with a ponytail asking me \" what do you want? \" with an attitude.  I'm like ok maybe I took it wrong.  Then I say I want a milkshake.  \"Which one\" comes angrily out of her mouth.  It took me a second to order cause I was shocked at how callous she was.  When I said \"ummm\" she let out a heavy sigh. Then continued to order the other girl to make my drink.  And I still left a tip!. I felt bad for the other girl she was working with the most."}
{"text":"I always get the ice cream sandwich. 2 chocolate chip cookies and the pecan praline ice cream. I believe the ice cream is thrifty brand, which is amazing! I know there are a bunch of ice cream sandwich places around now, but this is the best one I have found !"}
{"text":"Every time we stop in for some treats, all of the young ladies there treat us like gold.  Always a friendly smile and greeting, fast prompt service as well as delicious Ice cream. Just stop in anytime for a ice cream sandwich. It is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great service. Prices are awesome. ($3 for 2 cookies filled w/lot of ice cream in between). Lots of cookies & ice cream flavors to choose. Cookies are to die for! They have Cakes & Sundaes too."}
{"text":"Don't go here unless you want your teeth chipped by metal washers!  This place has gone down hill, so do your family a favor and head to the place on Trop!"}
{"text":"My daughter wanted Ice Creme Saturday and I remembered a sign for Thrifty, (my Favorite) The place was busy, One person working the counter and a guy standing in the back looking at customers.. Here is the good,,, The cookies and Ice cream are top notch, the 3.50 price tag wasn't even scarey.      The Bad..  I didnt care for the lack of service and I really didnt like the chairs being grimy, not just dirty.  The wall is missing paint and there are shoe and heel marks all over the wall at the base as well. More effort needs to go into cleaning the front of the house, because it clearly sends a message to customers that it may be that dirty in the back of the house.."}
{"text":"Sweet Addiction is in walking distance... can you say trouble? The husband and I had a hankering for something sweet and stopped in. We didn't grow up with Thrifty ice cream so we asked for a recommendation, we were told the Chocolate Malted Crunch was a winner. We went with that and chocolate chip and brownie cookies to make it a sandwich. The cookies were not the same size and the scoop of ice cream was too lopsided to enjoy it as a sandwich, but that's not to say it wasn't enjoyed. I loved the cookies. I was less thrilled with the ice cream, I grew tired of the malt flavor, but that's just a personal thing there are dozens of other flavors to try. We were able to save 50 cents by checking in on facebook. My only nitpick is the styrofoam bowls... I have an aversion to sound of friction on styrofoam and the cookies fit snug and the noise is hard to avoid. Bizarre, I know."}
{"text":"Love this place really good ice cream and the cookies are fantastic. However been in here a couple time and they run out of cookies like Chocolate chip, kinda of a big one here to run out of a popular cookie. Great place for a sweet treat."}
{"text":"The ice cream is fantastic (THRIFTY) and the cookies are good. But I couldn't easily maneuver the sandwich thing.   Thrifty ice cream is one if my favorites. Like a few others, I grew up eating the stuff as a kid. But it's so specific, I don't know if most of the flavors lend themselves to the complication of a sandwich.  It's not gourmet, and maybe that's the problem. It's a simple ice cream that doesn't offer much depth for a modern ice cream sandwich. If I go back, I'll probably get a simple vanilla with a brownie cookie.   Speaking if cookies, the cookies were soft and sweet, but I ended up eating my cookies and ice cream separately. My ice cream was too soft to hold up to the sandwich expectation and I didn't want it to melt while I was busy trying to work it out.    I like the idea of this place and I think using Thrifty ice cream makes sense in terms of its popularity and nostalgia factor."}
{"text":"Twice in one week... Geez... Great prices, great service and um... Delicious. I had white chocolate macadamia nut cookies (my favorite cookie) with pistachio ice cream (my favorite ice cream). You cannot fathom how happy I was. I am going to bring all of my friends here to support this wonderful new local business."}
{"text":"This place serves GLUTEN FREE cookies! And over 20 flavors of GF Thrifty ice cream. You can even order ice cream by the  pint or quart to go:) If you are a gluten free girl like myself....you know how rare it is to find a place that offers REALLY good dessert. This is it!! The only downfall is that it is way too close to my office. I'll be needing twice the amount of visits to the gym now. Worth it! Staff is super attentive and takes pride in their product. I love supporting local business owners instead of large national franchises. Sweet Additcion has done it right!"}
{"text":"Loved it for years! Being a California native I was super excited to find a place that sold thriftys ice cream years ago. That ice cream is the best and their cookies are amazing! Their employees are all super sweet. One really hot day I called from the parking lot and asked if they could please prep my sandwich so I didn't have to leave my pup in the hot car and they did.  My favorite combo is an ice cream sandwich with brownie cookies and cookies and cream ice cream. I also like their white chocolate macadamia cookies"}
{"text":"I dig the concept ( in fact, little do they know, it was my idea !! I was actually looking at cookie and ice cream recipes for the same concept ... only better... honest ! )   nice selection of cookies and ice cream and the price point is excellent.   I hope this place can make it through the winter so i'll partake further in the summer months !"}
{"text":"I stopped in after eating at the Thai place a few doors down. I had mint chip sandwiched between two M&M cookies. It was absolutely delicious. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love the icecream here but who doesn't love thriftys icecream. The reason for the 2 stars is because this place is dirty. Every time we go there the floors are gross and the icecream area always has old icecream all around the sides. The final straw was when we walked in one night and two employees were there at the time, one was in back and the other behind the counter sweeping. When she seen us come in she stopped sweeping which was nice but here comes the problem.... she asks what we would like and proceeds to pick up my cup to start scooping. I stopped her and asked her if she would please wash her her hands and give me a new cup? The employee was nice and said yes but as a customer that doesn't want to eat from someone's hands that just touched a broom I was pretty disgusted.   Call me a clean freak but to me that's just not a clean way of handling food. Had we of not walked in and seen her sweeping, we would have had no idea that she was handling our food with unclean hands. Ignorance is not bliss and I don't want to feel uncertain about the cleanliness of where we eat."}
{"text":"The cookies are amazing and so fresh definitely the best ice cream sandwich I have ever had"}
{"text":"I went to check into Sweet Addiction on Perka and was notified that this was my 60th time checking in (not counting the times before I got the app and times I forgot to check in). So I figured that a review was way overdue!   We've been coming to here to satisfy our ice cream cravings since they first opened. Doesn't it seem like there aren't too many options for actual ice cream in Vegas? Sure, we have plenty of froyo shops but very few old school by the scoop shops to choose from.   Anyway, the Thrifty's ice cream is on point here and they have many flavored to choose from. They also make fresh baked cookies throughout the day which makes for a yummy ice cream sandwich! I haven't personally tried the milkshakes here but I've heard they are good, too.  When this place first opened, it was owned by two local sisters that had amazing people skills. Always friendly service and generous scoops as well. I have to say I was a bit worried when I heard the business is under new ownership, BUT so far so good! Everything seems to be business as usual and I appreciate the new owner staying true to the original Sweet Addiction standards.   Favs: mint chocolate chip, rocky road and butter pecan (my kids love the rainbow sherbet, cotton candy and the frosted circus animal cookie one...forgot the actual name of that one)  Tips:  - get the Perka app and check in to earn free scoops and sandwiches - they have different specials through out the week so make sure you check that out before you order"}
{"text":"Visited this place after enjoying some good food over at Kaffe Live, next door. It was my first time and I have to tell you... Good selections of ice cream. I had the strawberry with sugar cookie sandwich  Great customer service and good location."}
{"text":"Went there last week for a chocolate chip with chocolate malt crunch ice cream sandwich and it was bomb! Just perfect to share for two or perfect for yourself!   Cute place and area too!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and it's my new spot when I have a sweet tooth for some fresh cookies and my fav, Thrifty Ice Cream this is the place. I love supporting local businesses!  Prices are reasonable and a perfect portion. Even the husband likes this place"}
{"text":"I frequent Sweet Addiction not by my choice...but because my daughter does good deeds and finishes her veggies JUST to earn another visit to this ice cream shop!    On the way there I always say, \"I don't need ice cream.\" And partially believe that I have the power to resist the temptation. But, let's be honest...I DONT!  I am weak!    Sweet Addiction serves Thrifty ice cream, the only ice cream that brings me back to my childhood. On a hot summer day my grandpa would walk with me to the store and treat me to a monstrous single scoop cone for $1.00.  Maybe it's the memories that make the ice cream more delicious.  Either way, it's my absolute FAVORITE!    Squish those memories between 2 soft homemade cookies, and VOILA!  It's beyond magical. It's irresistible!  I'm addicted! (Don't tell Chloe, though. The good deeds and veggie-eating is just my cherry on top of this deal!)"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic- delicious Thrifty Ice Cream, soft fresh baked cookies, fun atmosphere- definitely check it out!!"}
{"text":"Sweet Addiction is a small little place located on the west side of town, near 215 and Tropicana, specializing in ice cream cookie sandwiches. Their ice cream's are made by Thrifty. I don't know about you but for some odd reason, Thrifty ice cream is pretty good, despite the brand. Fresh baked cookies daily, and also quite the variety of cookies as well.   Many ice cream flavors + various flavors of cookies equaling many different combinations possible ! Also, you are not limited to have TWO of the same cookie either in the same sandwich !   Nice note for yelpers, little discount upon check-in but valid only 1 per order. So if you want to take advantage of it, and a few people, have everyone check in and pay for their own. Haha.   Staff is friendly and won't rush you if its your first time. Bright, clean environment.   Great for kids ! Price very reasonable. Yummy after meal snack !   --------------------  on the side note, they had this cucumber drink in their side fridge... it was kinda weird LOL"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked in not knowing what this dessert place was about. Our server (not sure of his name... Tall with dark hair) was very nice and told us how it works.  It's basically an ice cream sandwich with fresh cookies and a scoop of ice cream. They have a good variety of ice cream and cookies as well!  I wasn't feeling hungry enough for the whole sandwich, so I just got one cookie with a scoop of ice cream. The cookie was great. I got salted caramel ice cream, and I wish it had just a little bit more caramel in it.   You can call in and order to go which is cool.  Overall I will definitely come back! :)"}
{"text":"Tasty treats, and the Thrifty's ice cream was a taste of nostalgia. Thanks and keep up the tasty work."}
{"text":"Some places you fall in love with the moment you go in. Thats exactly how I feel about this place. Its a husband /wife duo that owns the place so its not a chain and I love that about it.   The way it works is really simple. You pick out 2 cookies, DELISH and made from scratch, then pick out your icecream and there it is! They also sell things by themselves and they have cookie cakes as well as rootbeer floats. Everything is at a low pricepoint.   Amazing people, remembered my name after only coming in once. Great place to go with friends or family, as there are tons of places to sit down and hang out! Ive been twice this week and will back soon Im sure!"}
{"text":"Homemade cookies and Thrifty ice cream... Need I say more? Go try it."}
{"text":"Our server was so nice and  patient with my children as they went through all the different selections of ice cream and cookies they absolutely loved it and was so excited this is our new be good treat shop!"}
{"text":"My buddy once brought me a cookie icrecream from here when i told him i never even heard of the place. i cant say it was the best rockyroad cookie'd icecream i ever had, cuz i've never had a cookie'd icrecream quite like this. what i will say was the cookies were incredibly soft and delicious, and the rocky road was exactly how i imagined it. had some m&m's, sprinkles, and those crispy wafer thing they got in a Crunch bar. it was incredible. if you have never visited definitely do so, its not expensive and you will see first hand how this place lives up to its name."}
{"text":"Great prices and cute discounts on different days. My son and I enjoyed our ice cream outside. It was nice out and we really enjoyed our ice cream. After we ate we played a few rounds on the arcade game (only 1) they have inside. Friendly staff. We will be back soon and often!"}
{"text":"Alright, since I'm already not a fan of ice cream, I'll try to make this as unbiased as possible.  I came in with my friend and I initially planned on not ordering at all. However, they had some kind of special going on where you text a number and your ice cream sandwich is buy one get one free. So I went ahead and texted the number, and showed my phone to the cashier who told me that my ice cream sandwich would be free if my friend bought one. After picking out what I wanted (I had mint chocolate chip w/ mint chocolate cookies), and after my friend pays for his, we were about to walk out.  Suddenly the cashier yells, \"So which one of you is paying for that?\"  Are you serious? Your promotion says it was free and you JUST told me it would be free. Buy one get one free right? My friend bought one. We get one free, right?  I didn't carry any money on me, which is why I wasn't planning on getting anything in the first place. My friend ended up paying for two, and I had to pay him back later. As he was paying the cashier (a guy) was eyeing us down the whole time like we were thieves.  If their ice cream was not exceptional, I would have given this place 1 star. 3 stars for the ice cream, nothing else."}
{"text":"Good portions. Ice cream option is only and all thrifties. Cookies are delicious and perfectly baked. Service when I was there wasn't the best but it didn't bother me too much. The portions are generous and the pricing is good. I don't see myself coming back but I did enjoy what I got."}
{"text":"Me and my sister are California natives and LOVEEEEED our Thriftys ice cream, I used to have it all the time. We moved out here and found nothing quite the same. One day while going shopping we saw a sign that said \"SERVING THRIFTYS ICE CREAM\" We died!!!!!!!!!! I didnt care where, what or how much it cost....So we went in and were soooo pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere, how clean and fresh looking it was ANDDD that you came create your own Ice Cream cookie sandwich. We have been back 3 times since we discovered it and we cant get enough. Such a great idea to bring Thriftys Ice Cream to Vegas.... Now if only they will open a Henderson location so we dont have to drive so far!!!! (hint hint )"}
{"text":"So nice to find thrifty ice cream.. but they staff is too young and unprofessional. I understand its an ice cream shop but that's no excuse to be rude."}
{"text":"Bought a group on here, and it was everything I hoped for! me: white chocolate macadamia nut cookies with my favorite ice cream ever, chocolate malted crunch Kiddo: m&m cookies with cotton candy ice cream,which was surprisingly amazing....and pretty. hot pink and turquoise daddy: mint chocolate cookies with mint chocolate ice cream  we all love,love,loved our treats, and I'm so glad people bought me groupons as gifts, because I cant wait to return!  Also You cane have two different cookies and they have different treats like cakes, malts, and sundaes, but I failed to get a pic, o well."}
{"text":"I got seconds in one sitting. End of review.  But seriously. This place has really delicious BUTTERY cookies which they make ice cream sandwiches out of. The ice cream I had (note that I \"sampled\" twice) weren't icy or hard like they can be at a hand dipped ice cream shop, they were creamy and perfect like you expect.   I had an ice cream sandwich composed of a snickerdoodle and chocolate chip with walnut cookies and brownie ice cream sandwiched within. Then I noticed they had my all-time fav listed on the side wall. Rocky Road. I knew I had to get myself some.   The only reason I can't give this place a 5-star review is because I can't honestly see myself driving all the way to the other side of town to get these particular ice cream treats. There are a lot of places we make a drive for, but this place will simply be a stop on the way.   TIP: make sure you take note of the available ice creams on the left wall near the display case."}
{"text":"This is the greatest place in the world, hands down.  I'm thankful that it is a good 20 minutes away from my house so I won't be 1,000 pounds any time soon.  The cookies are great. Thrifty's ice cream...wonderful. Just wonderful.  And the best part....It's only $3 for an ice cream sandwich! Even cheaper if you just want one or the other.  Man oh man. Go here and cry. Cry lovely, golden, sweet tears of happiness."}
{"text":"The sugar cookies, chocolate chip with nuts and the macadamia nut cookies are EVERYTHING!! In addition I also love their chocolate ice cream!! Repeat customer here! I do wish their line moved a bit faster though"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open for months. It's right around the corner from my home. I wasn't sure what to expect at first, but as long as they had ice cream, I was happy. I FINALY got there yesterday, and as soon as I opened the door to go in, I knew I was in for a treat. I could smell the fresh cookies being bakes. Then I looked up at the menus for the ice cream flavors, (20) in total, and I was even more happy. They have fresh baked cookies, 10-12 flavors, great ice cream, soda, milk, juices, water, and I think coffee. You can buy ice cream cookie sandwiches, I bought 3 types, pick a flavor cookie, then pick your ice cream, big cookies, nice ice cream, all together in a cup, ready to eat. These things were great. You can also buy just ice cream, or just cookies, what ever you want. Everything I had was great, and I'm heading back down now to pick up some cookies, and a couple ice cream sandwiches. Check it out, it's really good. Plus, the girls working there are friendly, and do a great job!!!"}
{"text":"If you've read my review on Thrifty's, you'll know that we're fans! A store that has Thrifty's AND delicious homemade cookies AND a friendly staff?!?! That equals 5 stars to me!  We're rarely on this side of town, but when we are, we try to make a stop. They are open later than the Thrifty's ice cream store on Pecos, so we love that. Plus, their staff has always been patient and helpful. You know, when you're standing there looking dumbfounded with your mouth open, with all these ice cream and cookie choices and you can't decided?! They'll offer helpful suggestions so you can stop drooling and start eating!  You want cookies? Just ice cream? Sure...What you're actually supposed to do is make an awesome ice cream sandwich. You pick both, whatever floats your boat. My best creation was probably Thrifty's Medieval Madness ice cream in between two oatmeal raisin cookies. THESE COOKIES ARE YUMMY! Go try them, trust me...  Probably about 6 tables inside. Not much seating, but kept clean.   Yelp check-in special: $0.50 off ice cream sandwich"}
{"text":"So good.   You cant go wrong with Thrifty's Ice Cream wrapped with a cookie!   Staff is so friendly."}
{"text":"Came here with the kidlets on a recent trip to LV. Very good as expected since they serve Thrifty's ice cream. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Came in here a few days ago and there wasn't a wow factor to it. The ice cream is Thrifty's which is great!!! My husband ordered a milkshake and to him it was good but to my taste buds it was less than good.....  The only reason I'd come back is exclusively for the Thrifty's ice cream because this shop is close to my home."}
{"text":"Cute place and a great price point. Cookies are homemade and a decent variety of ice cream."}
{"text":"Well if April says its good then I have to try it!    This was our Yelp stop number two on a three restaurant stop.  I had seen great reviews on Yelp about it and I was so glad our friends suggested we go to Sweet Addiction for dessert.  I saw the homemade brownie cookies to make my ice cream sandwich with.  The cookie itself was huge and did taste like a brownie with the brownie like bendy consistency.  (Yes, bendy is a word I just made it up!)  But what to put between for the ice cream?  Well for me of course it has to be chocolate if you've ever read my gelato reviews.  The clerk suggested a chocolate malt and he let me taste it.  Of course!  So he made my sandwich and served it to me in a bowl.  Elbowing my way past the Yelp takeover, I found a seat and started to enjoy my ice cream.    What is it about an ice cream sandwich that transports you back to being a kid again?  One of my neighbors used to make homemade ice cream sandwiches and this was so much the feeling I got when eating this ice cream.  I felt like someone lovingly prepared some homemade cookies and made a big plump ice cream sandwich just for me.  We all enjoyed our desserts and I am pretty amazed that I ate all of it.    We had a great time and management was so awesome to give us $.50 off our desserts for checking into Yelp.  They were very fun and seemed to enjoy having us in the store.  I can't wait to come back and bring the kids!"}
{"text":"What can I say?!?! Thrifty Ice Cream!  I pretty much grew up with these ice cream! Brings back so much memories and makes me feel like a kid again.   All time favorite, hands down, coconut pineapple!!  And when SACIC decided to put it in fresh baked cookies, even better!  Note: you can choose two different cookies to make the cookie ice cream sandwich.  So,  if you're in the SW area part of town and want something sweet on any hot day in Vegas. Stop by Sweet Addiction~"}
{"text":"This was a good change in dessert. Only problem I have is that you cant really eat it like an ice cream sandwich. The ice cream pushes out the opposite end when you try to bite into it, thus causing you to eat it in a bowl with a spoon. Not sure I understand this concept as its now ice cream in a bowl. VERY sweet. I love sweet things, but this was almost too much.   Will I be back? Possibly. If I'm in the vicinity and craving ice cream I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great. It's a small shop, and every time I've been there it's been very quiet. They've got what I would consider to be homemade cookies with an awesome selection of ice cream. They also have a small but fair range of sodas to choose from as well. I definitely enjoy stopping by every now and again just to get a solid ice cream sandwich.  I also think their pricing is pretty good too. I recall spending $3-4 on their standard two-cookie one-scoop ice cream sandwich, which is more than enough for one person."}
{"text":"I will say I lovvvve thrifty's ice cream, and or a while it was super hard to get here in town.  So this place was obviously was a no brainer for me... so why 2 stars? On several occasions I got less than stellar service, I mean its kids working here, so theres always attitude, but 1. don't get annoyed when we show up ten minutes before closing, you're still open, and you're not making a soufflé here, I'm still out before you're actually closed.  and 2. Yes sometimes people want samples... 5 or more is abusing the system... 3 is making my mind up,, nothings for free, so sure i tip 2 bucks on a 4 dollar ice cream, and the server/scooper pretends not to notice...   the cookies are ok... not great... they are the soft, chewy, borderline not sure if they've been cooked enough variety, which hey, cookies are a personal thing.... but for an ice cream sandwich i think a cookie with a bit of crunch is better... the chewiness lends to a bite that takes a bit to get through and pushes your ice-cream out the back (insert thats what she said here)   all in all, best ice cream, lackluster cookies, shorty service, at a decent price."}
{"text":"Yummy Ice cream. Thrifty ice cream has been a LONg time fave! Cookies are yummyyyyyyy too"}
{"text":"Cookies and Thrifty Ice Cream...how can I not love this place??"}
{"text":"Sometimes, the Yelp community will mislead you. It's uncommon, but hey, it happens, and in the case of Sweet Addiction, they - ok, we - whiffed completely.   You cannot build a good ice cream sandwich on a bad cookie and this one was among the worst chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. It was soft, as promised, but that flavor....yuck is all I can say. The taste was so awful that I couldn't even finish the whole thing, not that there was much cookie to begin with. And at $1 per (90 cents plus tip), this was the second biggest rip-off of the week.   The store is cute and the staff is very friendly, but when frozen cookie dough tastes twice-frozen, it's a loser every time. And when your cookie can't even compete with the boxed cookie special at Albertson's, you should just quit. Seriously."}
{"text":"Customer Service: Amazing! They were so friendly and made sure we knew how to order and what the possibilities were.  Food: I grew up eating Thrifty's ice cream in California and would eat it in Las Vegas at Rite Aid. The day Rite-Aid closed down was very upsetting but my joy soon returned as I started seeing more and more Thrifty's stands popping up around town. This is the amazing Thrifty's ice cream and deliciously fresh-baked cookies -- the combination cannot be beat! There are plenty of ice cream flavors and types of cookies to choose from.   The Environment: It is simple yet unique. Plenty of seating inside and very inviting for customers to sit and enjoy their sweet treat.   For $3 and amazing food, you must go!"}
{"text":"Sweet Addiction is one of my favorite small businesses in town and beats out CREAM in my opinion. If you don't see your favorite flavor cookie, ask them if they're in the oven... 3/4 of the time they are! -1 star for lack of seating."}
{"text":"Another scratched off my to do list!  Went here after dinner with a fellow yelper. The place we came from didn't offer any desserts that look all that appealing so i suggested Sweet Addiction seeing as i've heard nothing but good things about them.  First impression was noticing that Waffles Cafe's banner is still on the plaza board.  So what does Sweet Addiction offer one who's never been there before? Well they have a selection of ice cream flavors and cookies. They specialize in mashing ice cream between said cookies thus making ice cream sandwiches.   I choose to go for a chocolate chip and an M&Ms with Pecan Parline in the middle. Excellent quality ice cream but the cookies could have been a bit softer.   This is a great place to have a quick bite for a sugar rush."}
{"text":"Thrifty's ice cream AND fresh baked cookies? I just died and went to sweet tooth heaven!   I've been here about 4 times, and by far my favorite combination is birthday cake ice cream with snickerdoodle cookies. Just the right amount of birthday to make anyone snicker!"}
{"text":"sweet addiction rocks!! best ice cream is the best ! great staff, great ice cream! great cookies !!"}
{"text":"What could go wrong with cookies and ice cream?! Well, nothing, actually. The combination is so simply delightful that there isn't much effort required... or received.  Male staff present was friendly, female was bored and disinterested. BF and I got two different cookie sandwiches and both were okay, but nothing more than cookies and ice cream. Tuxedo cookies were tasty and chewy, mocha almond fudge ice cream was decent. BF got two different cookies and the mint chocolate ice cream, and it was also solid.  Cookies were out in open air, uncovered, which was a little odd. Would think that would be against health code but I guess not. Cookie was mashed into bottom of bowl, topped with a scoop, and closed with another cookie- not quite what I pictured but what was necessary given the size of the assembled dessert.  I appreciated the variety of flavor combinations that could be customized with different cookies (or getting two different ones) and ice cream flavors. Portion was gigantic and we easily could have split one instead of having our own. Pricing was fair for the portion, but I liked that they have a text offer to get $1 off, bringing our total to under $7.  In short, cookies + ice cream is a no-brainer but more work needs to be put into the execution of this basic idea."}
{"text":"I love this place ! I live in Centennial and I drive all the way over here for the amazing homemade cookies and thrifty's ice cream !!! The brownie cookies are my favorite and I can't help but indulge in the chocolate chip ice cream. Love love LOVE ! Would definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"I would usually give this place 4 (or even 4.5 stars if it was possible), but tonight they only get 3 due to the service. It was a busy night but that's no excuse for an unfriendly staff and a downright rude cashier. We've been going here since they first opened. Prior to tonight, the staff has been great. But tonight they definitely looked and acted like they didn't want to be there. It's a good thing their cookies are delish, or I would be more inclined not to return."}
{"text":"Cookies suck and burnt . Ice cream taste like nothing special and watered down . Kind of a waste of money because I know better places to go . Last resort kind of place ."}
{"text":"I love love love this place!!!! We love coming here for our cheat days with my sister and her fiancé. I always get the chocolate chip with walnut cookie sandwich with coconut pineapple ice cream! It is absolute heaven. The employees here are super nice and sweet. Always upbeat and full of energy. Everyone needs to try sweet addiction."}
{"text":"Came in today for some ice cream, slightly disappointed with the old ice cream with soggy ingredients when it comes to its pistachios and nuts. Have to keep a inventory new and not hold onto old stuff. Get better soon will you!"}
{"text":"Thrifty's Ice Cream!!  While needing an ice cream fix while out with our friends, we stopped by Sweet Addiction.  This place is all about the custom made cookie ice cream sandwiches.  You pick your ice cream and pick your cookie and viola!  While I wasn't interested in the ice cream sandwich, I was able to get a scoop of the black cherry Thrifty ice cream.  My husband got the rootbeer float and our friends each got a scoop of the mint chocolate chip ice cream.  Simple shop that serves Thrifty ice cream.  Service was nice and the place was clean.  I believe they even had gluten free cookies!"}
{"text":"Good homemade cookies. Thrifty ice cream. Good prices. Nice people."}
{"text":"The ice creams takes me back to my childhood when we would drive to the Thrifty Drug store for the ice cream in the middle of the hot summer. My all time favorite was the black cherry and the pineapple coconut.   Sweet addiction up it up a notch by putting my favorite icecreams in between 2 scrumptious cookies of your choice.  1st you pick you cookie then you pick your favorite ice cream and then they sandwich it for you. So good and so worth checking out.   The parlor is cute and the staff is super sweet...no pun! They a have a different special for each day of the week so  ale sure you check that out but my favorite of coarse is $2 ice cream sandwich Tuesday. Oh and don't forget to check I. To receive a $0.50 cent off a regular purchase.   Go go addicted at Sweet Addiction!"}
{"text":"I had been waiting months to try Sweet Addiction and was thrilled when my husband said we could go. I went to a similar place in Huntington Beach and was raving to him about how much he was going to love it, ice cream and cookies, how could it go wrong? But it did.   Upon arriving I noticed the decor and I actually enjoyed it, very modern and clean, and it looks like homemade paintings on the wall- tucked behind the refrigerator that is holding the soda and water. The smell of cookies was ridiculous and I was excited to start my cookie, ice cream creation.  I then noticed how small the ice cream bar area was and that the cookies were stacked on a self that was only about 2 feet from the ceiling.   After canvassing the place, we decided to try and place an order. Like I stated previously we had never been here so my husband was taking a little longer to order to which we were told to \"step aside and let the next person order,\" there was one person behind us and she was ready either. When I looked at the menu and saw a cookie sundae\" option it read \"2 scoops of ice cream, one cookie, and hot fudge\"  that sounded like what I wanted minus the fudge.   While placing my order with the tall blonde girl behind the counter I said \"the cookie sundae please with ___ and ___ ice cream and ___ for the cookie, hold the hot fudge,\"  to which the girl replied,\"so do you want whipped cream?\"  me: \"oh no thank you,\"  her: \"so thats not a sundae, just get the 2 scoops and a cookie\"   .....   Alright so yes, I suppose I should have realized that a sundae would indeed include whipped cream and fudge, however, I have been in the customer service industry long enough to know that you do not speak to a customer that way. I then heard the same girl speak to another customer in a rude manner. Then noticed that the male that worked there was standing between the back of house and the counter fidgeting with whipped cream and clearly avoiding with any sense of work duty-which always annoys me. Have some work ethic people!!  The ice cream was alright but a little freezer burnt  and the cookies were hard (probably due to the fact they are baked in the morning and left on an open shelf the rest of the day). I have to say that I probably would have been fine with this place if I hadn't first been brushed aside and then treated like an idiot. I also don't like the fact that no one that works here wears a  name tag.   Personally, I can go to a restaurant that has the best food ever but when the service and attitude of the people that work there is poor and down right negative, I will not waste my time or money to go back."}
{"text":"I just love Sweet Addiction my son and I love eating here! It's so amazing definitely get the ice cream sandwich with two cookies. My son always gets both chocolate chip cookies and cookie dough I've cream. I usually get one peanut butter one chocolate chip cookie and vanilla ice cream. They also have a second location in Henderson."}
{"text":"Simple concept. Cookies with ice cream, not too complicated. I enjoyed the cookie and although I'm not too familiar with the Thrity's ice cream excitement, I enjoyed that too. I had the oatmeal cookie with banana ice cream sundae. Good combo. The cookies didn't blow me away, but paired with the ice cream it was a nice dessert."}
{"text":"Thirty's Ice Cream, I'm there.Clean place, friendly service and tons of ice cream to choose from, all Thrifty's."}
{"text":"I used to be in this building at least twice a week, when it used to be Waffles. When i saw something else had taken it's place, I just had to try it.   I was pleasantly surprised upon walking in. The decor and layout of the store was so different. To my delight, they served Thrifty's ice cream !!   They serve mainly ice cream cookie sandwiches, but you can also get just ice cream, or root beer floats. As far at the sandwiches go, they said their cookies are made fresh everyday. You can pick two different cookies and ice cream to go in between all for only three dollars. THREE DOLLARS !!!   The cookies were great. They were fresh, and nice and chewy - just the way I like them. Two I had were great, [chocolate chip w/walnuts, and M&M cookie] were delicious, and not sweet at all. They stood up great to the mint chocolate chip ice cream I put between. THRIFTY'S MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP [I love Thrifty's] !   They also have a variety of different sodas, most of which I had never heard of. Next time I go, I'll be sure to try out one of their sodas.   I only wish this place was closer to me. Actually, I don't. I don't need to be eating ice cream sandwiches everyday, haha."}
{"text":"I love the THRIFTY ICE CREAM and the usually fresh soft cookies. Unfortunately my visit tonight wasn't that great. I always order a ice cream sandwich and 6 cookies. The girl that prepared my order gave me about a half a scoop of ice cream and the smallest cookies available. I probably don't need the calories so I'm okay with the cookies being small because I have 6 more. But they were crunchy, normally they are pretty soft. Maybe because they were the runts of the batch.  Now I am big on customer service, engaging in conversation, smiling, and giving a genuine thank you at the register. That didn't happen.  I just wasn't impressed tonight, and I brag about this place to all my friends, family and clients, hopefully they have a better experience.   If you are a fan of simple ice cream & fresh cookies, I would still give them a try   I'm a firm believer that feedback helps make a business better, you don't know what you don't know."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much but wow!! This place is amazing! The ice cream was actually a lot, I couldn't finish it alone. The cookies were so delicious I wanted to drive back for more. Will visit again!!"}
{"text":"Came to sweet addiction for the 1st time today with a friend that's Ben here b4. They serve thrify ice cream here which is great because I grew up on thrifys as a kid. So they offer many of ur usual ice cream store items like sundaes floats splits etc but they also have a menu item where u can pick to different fresh baked cookies then u pick the flavor of ice cream to go in the middle of the cookies basically building ur own custom ice cream sandwich! So I went with the brownie w/walnut ice cream wedged in between a fudge brownie cookie & a tuxedo cookie with is white & regular chocolate chips! After they put it together and I sat down to eat this huge sandwich it was so delicious! The cookies were soft and so fresh they broke apart Good thing they gave me a cup to put it in! I was so full afterward there was a bit left over but I couldn't resist so I killed it lol!   So All in All I gave it 4 stars cuz the device was great & so was the product! Definietly bring my kid back to enjoy a delicious desert at a very affordable price! I mean for the $3.69 I got this desert for its way more worth it than going to cold stones or one of those fast food joints and getting sumthing there! It definitely was sweet and addicting!"}
{"text":"I am having a hard time writing a review for this cookies and ice cream shop, because just thinking about it makes me drool, and I have to urge to hop in the car and go get an ice cream sandwich right that second.  But, I shall stay strong and spread the good word of what a wonderful place this is!  Okay, first of all- the cookies.  Yummy, soft and delicious!  I like the regular chocolate chip, chocolate chip and walnuts and the M&M cookies.  Fiance strictly orders the chocolate chip oatmeal because he loves it.   The ice cream!  Even if you don't want an ice cream sandwich (but who doesn't?  Really...), you can get all sorts of Thrifty brand ice cream.  From vanilla to birthday cake, your scoops are covered.  Put the two elements above together and a dangerously addicting combination is born!  For the price of an ice cream sandwich, plus the Yelp deal and their stamp card (via Perka app), it's a steal!  The people who work there are always smiling and friendly, and even though they are always packed the service is quick!  The best part, for me anyway, is that they are only a short 5 minute drive away and open pretty late!"}
{"text":"i just noticed at this very moment that i'd forgotten to write this review! senior moments are all too frequent these days. i digress...  do you live in the las vegas valley? do you like fresh, warm, home baked cookies? do you have loving memories of thrifty ice cream?  if you answered yes to any of the above questions, you will most definitely enjoy sweet addiction. so go and get your fix already! =P"}
{"text":"A very simple concept that satisfies the sugar craving within!  Pick your 2 cookies and ice cream flavour and voilà = ice cream sandwich.  We visited last night around 6pm and the place was empty, as most normal people were probably thinking of dinner, not dessert.  I selected the chocolate brownie cookie and tuxedo cookie for my \"bread\" and the birthday cake ice cream.  While the resulting sandwich was not the best I've sampled, I was happy enough with my selection and consumed every bite.  My cookies were pretty fresh and chewy.  Hubby had a simple pistachio ice cream cone and was more impressed than he thought he'd be, given that it was \"only\" Thrifty ice cream (I don't have any nostalgic associations with Thrifty -- apologies to those who do!).    I was a bit surprised by the few (empty) tables that were dirty.  If the place had been busy, then there would be some excuse for neglected tables.  But we were the only ones there!  Also, many yelpers commented on the uncovered cookies and I have to agree with them: NV health regulations may allow for uncovered food, but it makes more sense to cover the cookies (from bugs, dust, dryness, etc.).  Just my $0.02."}
{"text":"Upon walking in, the smell of fresh baked cookies drifted to my nose. Just the smell alone made my mouth water! I ordered the Authentic Addict Cookie Sandwich, which is basically a scoop of ice cream sandwiched between two cookies. You can never go wrong with pistachio ice cream between two tuxedo (white chocolate and regular chocolate chip) cookies! Don't forget to check in on yelp for an extra 50¢ off!  The place is somewhat small, so an extremely large party might take up all the tables... also, their cookies are replenished as they run out.  That means if the cookie you want is not that popular (my friend ordered a snicker-doodle), then chances are, the cookie will be hard. You will need to catch them during the perfect time of day if you want a soft fresh cookie!  I will definitely be back, but they need a slight better system to keep their cookies nice and soft. =)"}
{"text":"Sweet addiction is a little hole in the wall ice cream shop known by locals for making fabulous ice cream sandwiches with homemade cookies and thrifty ice cream. When I went in, there was about 24 different flavors on hand. The cotton candy, birthday cake and chocolate brownie are my personal favorites. There was also about 14 different types of cookies, I get chocolate brownie and my significant other got white chocolate macadamia and oh my goodness it was amazing. Seriously, the white chocolate macadamia was so so good. There is also a gluten free peanut butter cookie for those who have celiacs or a sensitivity to gluten which is nice. They also have a strange brand of sodas that have flavors like kitty piddle and zombie brain juice, which is cute. The kids working there were nice and answered all of our questions patiently. The seating area could be cleaner. They should magic erase the chairs and make sure the edges of the tile floor are clean(that's why 4/5 starts). They offer delivery through a secondary service called bite squad. Overall cute yummy place."}
{"text":"Cookies were good, our milk shakes were more like milk drinks  tasted good but was too thin of consistency."}
{"text":"What a mess of cookies and Thirty ice cream in such a good way. Servings are big, and easy for the kids to split a couple to a few ways. We are an ice cream family and really not much can be better than ice cream with cookies. Staff was great, and gave great suggestions on the mixes and matches to the kids, and to me. I have recommended to several friends, all that like, and one even gave bought me a gift card."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome!! Love it! Their cookies are nice and fresh off the oven. It never disappoints me. Oh, and just a tip, if you check into this place either on facebook or yelp, you get 50 cent off your ice cream sandwich.  All their ice cream flavors are good and of course their cookies are always so soft."}
{"text":"Staff was great and helpful. Great customer service. Cookie ice cream sandwiches are wonderful."}
{"text":"Thriftys ice cream. We didn't get to try the sundaes or ice cream sandwiches but they all looked pretty good in the pictures. The prices were very reasonable, not like Baskin Robbins where we spend almost $20-$25 for a family of 4. We would definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We stopped in here about a half hour before they closed on Sunday night, so they were out of a few types of cookies (the white chocolate cookie particularly bummed me out). But, it was late so no biggie!   The lady behind the counter was very nice and friendly and asked us if we wanted to sample anything. We sampled a few before we decided.  I ordered one tuxedo cookie and one peanut butter with Medieval-something-or-other ice cream. The lady helping us said it was a new flavor and she hadn't sampled it but that it had caramel and chocolate swirled into vanilla ice cream. Sold.   After I paid, I actually looked at the menu and noticed that they had toppings like caramel and fudge sauce. I wish I would have noticed that... but I'll keep it in mind for next time.   The cookies were a bit hard, probably because it was late and they weren't as fresh... but they were still REALLY REALLY DELICIOUS, especially the peanut butter cookie. Also, Thrifty ice cream never disappoints and this new flavor was amazing.   Cookies are one of my favorite things on earth.. especially when home made, so this place is a HUGE winner in my book. I will definitely be back. I would also love to see them make some type of a salted caramel chocolate chip cookie (hinthint)!"}
{"text":"Eric is fantastic.  Best customer service ever. Promote this guy! You can't do better with the flavors!"}
{"text":"The ice cream and cookies are really tasty.  The service is great and the overall look of the place is awesome.  Great place to satisfy your sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"What can you really add over two hundred plus reviews. Remind fellow yelpers that Sweet Addiction, Cookies & Ice Cream totally legit five star dessert nirvana more to the point cookie ice cream sandwich!!!!!!!!! It had been while for me since my last visit. It was actually at there other location in Henderson. I have always known about this location just never had that serious craving for some ice cream sandwich. I had visitors from the 808 went out for some sushi and decided get some ice cream sandwich for dessert. It something that you really don't see that often plus perfect way cool down on 100plus vegas day. This location is totally set up different then the other location. But above all the most important thing is consistency and the cookies tasted just as good. I love the white chocolate chip cookie. I got that for my choice of cookie. I can tell you tasted just as good just like my last visit. I went with different ice cream choice coconut/pineapple. So went with tropical kind of flavor. I LOVED it.   The smell from your first step in the store. AMAZING. I feel like they been baking cookies all day long and not often would make time just for cookie run. I feel that strongly about any of the cookies on the menu. There really that addicting just might have go back get dozen cookies writing about it. Lol. Seriously cookies are tasty. The ice cream the flavor change but really not many bad choices. You can always try sample first make sure. One of the differences between this location and the other location is ice cream display. One less section hold the ice cream. They have it in the back so no way can tell those flavors only based on the chalkboard listing on the side. Thankfully my friends pointed out or would have missed out on my final choice coconut/pineapple. The ice cream another part that could order gallon to go. I believe they sell pints in separate freeze off on the side.   If you never had ice cream sandwich....GET SOME. You will not be disappointed coming to Sweet Addiction, Cookies & Ice Cream. I plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to satisfy my sweet tooth. They carry my favorite childhood ice cream, which brings back memories.  They also make some of the best cookies in town."}
{"text":"Three Musketeers ice cream between 2 white chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"Very good home made cookies tried peanut butter, chocolate chip w/walnuts, brownie and oatmeal. I love Thrifty ice cream."}
{"text":"Did I go on a bad day?  First let me say that the ice cream gets five stars. Oh how I've missed Thrifty's, and Sweet Addiction has so graciously brought it back into my life.  The cookies are uhm.. not very good. I only tried two - the white chocolate chip macadamia and the chocolate brownie. The white chocolate was weird tasting. Barely any nuts, and probably too much butter because it tasted more like a shortbread cookie. The chocolate brownie was like a doggie biscuit. Hard as rock. It was really difficult to get over the texture.  I will definitely try it again, at least for the ice cream."}
{"text":"I was craving dessert, but I didnt know what I was looking for until I found Sweet Addiction!!!  They specialize in custom ice cream cookie sandwiches, and they are delicious! It was my first time there, and the girl at the counter explained how everything works to me and my boyfriend.  You get to choose any two cookies and then select from a variety of ice cream flavors. Many of both cookies and ice cream flavors to choose from, and you can tell the cookies were baked in - house.  My boyfriend is not always a dessert eater, but even he was able to customize something to his liking! I choose salted caramel ice cream in between a tuxedo and a sugar cookie. My boyfriend had cake batter ice cream in between a chocolate chip and a chocolate brownie cookie.   Everything was super yummy!! The staff said \"goodbye\" to us as we left.   I'll definitely be back to try other combinations and also to try a cookie milkshake (I'm thinking strawberry cheesecake blended with a chocolate brownie cookie??)   Oh!! I almost forgot! They have specials for the different days of the week and we just so happened to go on Tuesday for their $2 ice cream sandwich special!!"}
{"text":"Nice place for a quick & simple treat. Boys win on the tip jar for the young ladies making some cool treats. We were lucky to be Damaris's first Banana Split guest."}
{"text":"Omg yes.  So glad we were recommended to try this place out.  The soft cookies was a perfect match to the ice cream.  The cotton candy ice cream flavor though!!"}
{"text":"Great place! I love the concept. If they had a way to warm up the cookies it would be even better. I love the variety of cookies they have and the delicious ice cream options they carry. Too many different combos to choose from!"}
{"text":"I would like this place more if I've never had Diddy Reise in Westwood.  But alas since I know what those taste like and I know part of their appeal is to be super cheap, then this version just seems like a glorified copy. They are tasty but the price is what keeps me from going so often."}
{"text":"As a fan of the world famous ice cream sandwiches and cookies, Diddy Riese in LA, I was ecstatic when Sweet Addiction opened here in Vegas. It was an added bonus that the ice cream they use here was in fact THE BEST ice cream known to man, THRIFTY brand! At $1.50 for a Thrifty scoop of ice cream or $3.00 for an ice cream cookie sandwich, who can go wrong?! Oh, and if you check-in on Yelp, you get .50 off! SCOOOORE!   The first time I paid  a visit, I was one of two customers there and was able to chat with the owners who are SUPER NICE. I had promised them I would spread the word and bring some friends the next time. On my second visit, I had come with my friend's soccer team on a Friday night and it was clear that word had spread. The place was full and we ended up eating outside. I've never been so happy to see a place busy before! I have a feeling they'll pick up even more.   My only wish was that my teeth weren't so cold sensitive so I could gobble up the delicious ice cream cookie sandwiches a lot quicker!   Side note: I noticed a misspelling on the menu which made me smile because I have pronounced this word incorrectly for 24 out of 27 years of my life... \"SHERBERT.\" In the words of Homer J. Simpson, \"My kids do NOT eat sorbet. They eat sherbet, and they pronounce it sherbert, and they wish it was ice cream!\" I truly hope that this does not cause them to correct the misspelling because it adds character. Orrrrr perhaps change it altogether to my name. JUST KIDDDDDING... Honorable mentions perhaps?! :P  Sweet Addiction... Definitely that."}
{"text":"Homemade cookies and Thifty's Ice Cream is what their offering here at this fine establishment. My cookie of choice was the Chocolate Chip( my personal favorite). My Thifty Ice Cream was Chocolate Malted Crunch. Combined the two , it was a match made in Heaven!:). Tasty treats is what they have, and reasonable prices is what they give , and  happy faces is what I received !:) Delicious AW"}
{"text":"This place is extra clean. The staff are extra nice. Cookies and Ice Cream yey me! Its a nice family place. The cookies are HOME MADE. I posted a few pictures so check em out. The name says it all Sweet Addiction."}
{"text":"Delicious! Love the ice cream sandwich. Cookies are gooey and good. Thrifty ice cream served. Super sweet staff... my daughter (age 3) wanted cotton candy ice cream. Upon taking one bite she decided she just wanted vanilla. The girl was so nice and let her change the flavor without charging us, even though I offered to pay for it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a groupon offer, now I am a regular. Their ice cream and cookies are to die for! Fresh, creamy and delicious!! Don't forget to pick up a cookie because they are just as good. Their selection on ice cream is a little limited, but they have all the important favors you would look for. Good service too!!"}
{"text":"I live thriftys ice cream. And now homemade cookies? This place is awesome. It's 20 minutes away but well worth it. Such a simple idea and better than buying an ice cream cookie sandwich at Walmart. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Sooooo, I finally figured it out. I had a dream that I talked to an employee at this fine establishment. I said, \"How long have you worked here?\" He said, \"Since it opened.\" I said, \"What do you do?\" You can tell that he was embarrassed. He said, reluctantly, \"I sprinkle addictive drugs on the cookies.\" I said, Welp!!! That's it!!!\" I have wondered why I eat 47 cookies EVERY single time that I go there. The mystery has been revealed. Don't hesitate. Just go. Trust me. Thanks, Sweet Addictions!!!"}
{"text":"Chocolate malted crunch...everyone knows that's my kryptonite. . It doesnt help that my man loves ice cream either."}
{"text":"Sugar and sweet and everything GOOD!  If you like ice-cream cookies then this is the place.  They have a great selection of cookies and ice-cream.  Their chocolate chips cookies are the best.  They have floats there too.  I have seen their cookie cake and it looks fun and cool to have at a party.  Check in on yelp and get 50 Cents off.  Never a long line and always people inside."}
{"text":"today 10/12/13 i stopped in for a quick frozen treat.  my family and i are frequent costumers and LOVE this place!! but today i was unsatisfied by the service, normally you get a loud hello welcome, However today was not that day. also the attitude the girl gave us while getting our order made me want to walk out with nothing. I would have given sweet addiction a 2 star rating but the cookies were nice hot and fresh today so i bumped it up a star."}
{"text":"Delicious cookies and my girlfriend LOVED the birthday cake ice cream. Staff was nice and friendly and there was nobody else in there at 8pm on a Thursday night. The seating area looked a little beat up at first impression from damage to the wall by the backs of the chairs and it's extremely white, we both commented it felt a little hospital like but clean at the same time. Worth the drive and we will return!"}
{"text":"I like the idea of ice cream sandwich store, but not quite sure how it will last during the winter. The cookies were very good, but the ice cream was very sub par. It didn't taste home made, to be honest it would make a world of a difference if it was.  I had 2 white chocolate macadamia cookies with vanilla ice cream. I have had something similar in LA called Cool Haus, which is pretty much the same thing, but on a truck!"}
{"text":"Cookies are pretty good and soft, ice cream is decent. The place is clean and the staff was nice. I will not drive home saying this was the best ice cream of my life but it was good for what I expected"}
{"text":"Great place. Great staff. Great owners. A bit chilly but hey it's ice cream! Great job to the owners for living their dream and proving work for people and providing me with cookies and ice cream!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Thrifty Ice cream, however it's expensive for a desert place.  It's worth trying for something different."}
{"text":"After my 3rd visit here, I have decided that I am a fan. I think they've improved on their cookie recipe to make them soft and delectable. I remember the first time I ate here, 2 years ago, their cookies were so hard, I could barely bite through them after they hardened with the ice cream. They have definitely improved on their recipe and I urge people to re-try it if the cookies were what turned them off. The best combination ever: chocolate malt crunch with one tuxedo cookie (milk & white chocolate) and one white chocolate macadamia nut.  The sandwiches are very large, so I think splitting one for kids is the appropriate amount or else it would be too large of a sugar bomb.   We had a coupon from valpak or something for b1g1 free, but it seems like there are MANY ways to walk out of there with a discount, that they've displayed all through the store (FB check ins, 4square check ins, Yelp). Overall, we got 2 sandwiches for $3.70 something which is a crazy deal! My kids loved creating their own flavors (with a little parental assistance because chocolate chip cotton candy doesn't sound very appealing) so we will be back."}
{"text":"I love small businesses! This place is phenomenal! They have always kept low prices and they continue to make great deserts! The cookies are always soft and delicious. The ice cream is thrifty's! But I just love this place. I have been here probably 50 times since i first went there back 2 years ago.  The staff is great and my favorite part is the quality and quantity is exactly the same every single time. I have NEVER had a bad experience and they deserve every client that comes in there.  I have never met the owners, but I'd like to thank them for creating an ice cream shop in which I will remember. It's nostalgic! It's a great place!"}
{"text":"Omg. I wished I found this way sooner before I started my diet. My husband and I ate at Thai Noodle House and was looking for something sweet to end our dinner. We walked over and tried this place for the first time..it was the best thing ever!!! I had the white chocolate macadamia cookie with the pistachio ice cream which are two of my favorites. I wasn't too sure if they were gonna taste good together...and it did. It was the best thing I ever tasted. Will definetly come back on one of my cheat days for sure."}
{"text":"today i give it 3stars cuz the cookie was a bit hard. Not chewy like everyone has said.  I'm wondering if its depending on the time of the day you go there?  I've heard when the family is there and are baking the cookies are better.  I may be back."}
{"text":"Visited this place because I was craving ice cream. So my boyfriend decided to take me here. This is a decent sized ice cream shop and the workers are friendly, which is always a plus. This is a great chill place to hang out and it's kid friendly! There menu is a decent size which is always a good thing for me because you won't get bombarded with so many choices! And they have great deals"}
{"text":"There's so many good choices here I can never leave with just one thing. The cookies are way fresh and the ice cream is Thrifty!  I think the facility could use a good cleaning, or maybe a different color than white that shoes all the scuff marks of shoes but that's just being picky.   Based on what they sell, they're worth it"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a treat when we were in this part of town... and then came back the very next day! And it is quite the drive for us! Staff is super nice and the flavor combinations are endless. Homemade cookies are delicious and when combined with ice cream even better!"}
{"text":"Wow what a welcome addition the new addiction of sweet goodness is as in Sweet Addiction. Oh my so good indeed, great icecream Thrifty a good ice cream, and cookies that melt in your mouth and are so soft always.  The wonderful staff remebers you, if you have been before, and they have a winning combination of cookies and ice cream.  What a great place to go in the valley."}
{"text":"I love Sweet Addiction! The thrifty ice cream is absolutely delicious and the cookies are always warm and baked to perfection. They currently have specials each day of the week and I go to $2 Tuesdays for the $2 ice cream cookie sandwich. The service is great and the workers are kind and competent."}
{"text":"Nice surprise when your sweet tooth calls at 9:00 pm. Struck with nostalgia when I came across the my child hood favorite Thrifty flavored ice cream \"chocolate malted crunch\". Staff was dynamic and greeted us coming in and going out. Ambiance was cool and clean. Will make this my \"go to\" when looking for a sweet treat after dinner."}
{"text":"This is a cute new place to try.   COOKIES Their cookies are amazing.  My favorite ones would be the Tuxedo and the White chocolate macadamia.   ICE CREAM They Thrifty's ice cream is reasonably priced.  I have tried the Chocolate Malted Crunch and the Birthday Cake. The Birthday Cake was pure goodness ;)   SERVICE The service was great because they were very friendly.  Tip I like to get my cookies on the side because the ice cream melts pretty quickly in this terrible Vegas heat. The cookies end up being super soggy.   Overall Great place to try as soon as possible!!! :)"}
{"text":"This place sells two things, cookies and ice cream, and not much else. That's probably why their ice cream sandwich is such a knockout. All the attention is given to make their ice cream sandwiches great. Let's focus on the cookies, moist and yummy, always fresh and made from scratch. No store-bought cookies here, boys and girls. And with a decent selection such as white chocolate w/ macadamia nut, m&m, and oatmeal raisin cookies, to name a few, you're bound to find a nice complement to the wide selection of Thrifty's ice cream they serve. And just starting at $3.50, you can bring all your spawn in after an expensive day at the nearby waterpark. Great summer treat as well as anytime of the year."}
{"text":"Thrifty ice cream and fresh baked cookies are what my nostalgic heart craves :-) This place adds a new level to my Sunday fun day :-D Comics from maximum comics, check, ice cream sandwich and a Pops cherry cola double check ;-) Life is pretty damn sweet"}
{"text":"Great customer service and product! I ended up getting the Banana Nut Ice Cream (not displayed in the front) in between a White Chocolate Chip Macadamia Nut and a Oatmeal Butterscotch cookie. The cookies were moist and fresh and I thought the ice cream had a great banana flavor. They had a ton of ice cream and cookie options to choose from. I personally felt that it was better than LA's Diddy Riese and up to par with Berkeley's CREAM. Some people may say the $3.50 for the sandwich is a bit steep compared to those other places, but I think Sweet Addiction has a better quality cookie and gives a more substantial sandwich.  We were in there while they were training a new hire and I was very impressed with how thorough they were when it came to cleaning and using your time effectively. When I worked at Hot Dog on a Stick, the motto was, \"If you have time to lean, you have time to clean!\" and I think this store embraces that -- right when we left the store, someone had wiped down our table within seconds!"}
{"text":"Two words: Holy sh*t! Between the ice cream and the cookie, I was in heaven."}
{"text":"It seems like such a simple concept:  Pick a cookie & ice cream and make a sandwich, that it makes you wonder why it's so popular.  Well the ice cream is really good (manufactured by Thrifty) and the cookies are fresh!  You have your choice from 10+ kinds of cookies and even more flavors of ice cream, making you perfect your combination on each visit.  The price point isn't bad, just a little more than the per-wrapped Nestle Toll House sandwich's you buy at the gas station.  You won't need to worry about breaking your teeth on the frozen cookie with these though!"}
{"text":"Thrifty ice cream, homemade cookies and tons of combinations to make your own ice cream sandwiches.  What more can you really say?  Simply delish."}
{"text":"I already love thriftys ice cream as it is so for this place to have their ice cream in between their own cookies is a plus!  I usually get two scoops of ice cream for less than $3. My favorite flavors are birthday cake and chocolate malt crunch!  When I do decide to get their cookie sandwiches I always go for snicker doodle and chocolate chip. Their cookies are so soft and it compliments with the ice cream.   Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Sweet Addiction is a great place to enjoy a quick, simple treat that will satisfy your sweet tooth. There are a variety of cookie flavors to chose from and same thing with the ice cream flavors. Ordering was super easy thank goodness because the place was packed. For the price, the ice cream cookie was a great deal. A good way to cool off in this heat. The kids I saw there really seemed to be enjoying the cookie/ ice cream combo. I think I will try the root beer float next visit."}
{"text":"Got the Macadamia cookie and cookies n cream ice cream. Very good. Came with family . Nice place and very clean . Good price for a big scoop of ice cream."}
{"text":"The cookie monster would wet his pants if he ate here.   Sweet Addiction is a tiny ice cream and cookie shop on Ft. Apache.  I love every bite and every morsel in this joint.  If you don't have time to choose, grab an $8 dozen and head out the door.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"my new favorite place just in time for summer!! The cookies were delicious, fresh, and warm and with the addition of thrifty's ice cream?!? Amazing. I look forward to coming here again soon"}
{"text":"Employee was friendly. Ice cream and cookies were amazing. It could have been cleaner."}
{"text":"Yum! This place is so good! You can't go wrong with Thrifty Ice Cream! The service was AMAZING. A+ customer service! Eric was so friendly. I would 100% recommend this place for anyone looking for good ice cream and great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! My family and I go here every Sunday for their half priced sundaes ;) their cookies are always fresh (considering they make them the day of) I've never had a bad experience from this place. I don't have a big sweet tooth so sometimes I have to spilt a sundae with one of my family members! But their portions are definitely good sharing sizes. Even their ice cream cones are filling! They have so many options to choose from! Nonetheless, this is a great place to spend time with family. The environment is always bubbly! Definitely 5 star worthy!"}
{"text":"always good for an after dinner desert, employees are always friendly also"}
{"text":"Seriously hit the spot! I've been craving ice cream for a week now! They made me VERY happy!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of another popular dessert joint called Cream. They both have the same concept and the flavors that they offer are very similar.  The girl who was working at the counter was nice and she asked me and my friend if we would like to sample any of the ice-cream flavors. I ended up getting birthday cake ice-cream with sugar and M&M cookies. Cool thing is you can mix and match the cookies and ice-cream scoops. The quality and freshness of both get a thumbs up!   This establishment is pretty small compared to other dessert places, and because of this, tables and chairs may get filled pretty fast when it gets busy. Wouldn't be the place to hang out for very long if you're with a big group of people.  As for the interior design/decor, it is very plain and simple. There's nothing that sets it apart from other themed-businesses.  All in all, I wouldn't travel all this way just for cookies and ice-cream, since Cream is a lot closer. But it's a nice lil dessert stop in the Southwest side of town. Great pick if you're in the area and in the mood for something sweet :]  Pro-Tips: -Their other location is in Henderson (Green Valley Pkwy) -They have an ApplePay machine next to the register, but their account here on Yelp says they don't accept it. Not sure why."}
{"text":"This place is like a crazy cheap compared to other Ice Cream places.  They offer milkshakes, and SUNDAES on Sunday!    Last night I had a Sundae with Cotton Candy, and Mint Chocolate chip.  MMMmm.   This place is going to be missed if we move away. Great customer service, friendly chipper girls helped us out with our first time ever ordering here."}
{"text":"After lunch... no.. after every meal I always look for an ice cream shop for dessert because something about ice cream after every meal just feels right.  I asked for a recommendation for a good shake mix and.... I forgot her name so we will call her amy...  Amy suggested that I try this coffee and some kind of strawberry vanilla. I had it topped with chocolate sauce and my goodness this shake was bomb!  Go amy.. you the best."}
{"text":"Great ice cream. Very creamy. Wish the cookies could have been softer though. Overall a good ice cream cookie sandwich :-)"}
{"text":"Delish ice cream cookie sandwiches made from a selection of homemade cookies filled with Thrifty ice cream.  Friendly staff and great service makes it a repeat dessert stop for me and the kiddos!"}
{"text":"We are sitting here watching the Oscars and my wife brings out Sweet Additions Cookies andIce Cream for desert. Five stars for both the ice cream and cookies. We love this place."}
{"text":"THRIFTY ICE CREAM HERE  Cute little place in the plaza. I haven't had thrifty ice cream since i was in high school back in Cali so it was a nice surprise to have childhood memories come back. My favorite has ALWAYS been rainbow sherbet since thrifty ice cream is the only one that tastes kinda creamy instead of just icy.  There were 2 girls working but only one of them were helping us, while the other one was doing something in the back. There were 5 of us so we were a bit of a handful i would say. They also allow you to SAMPLE the flavors before you actually make your final decisions.   They have weekly SPECIALS going everyday as well which is always FUN! To add to the uniqueness of the place, they offer interesting sodas in a glass bottle w/ cute little names.  MOCHA ALMOND FUDGE SHAKE $5.50 - you get to pick 2 different ice creams & 2 different toppings to add into the shake or you could get it on the side as well.  RAINBOW SHERBET SCOOP $1.95 - single scoop of ice cream is so cheap! obviously not as cheap it used to be, but still."}
{"text":"I have been so excited about trying Sweet Addiction so when I went, I went just a little crazy. I got the chocolate chip cookie and white chocolate chip with brownie ice cream in the middle. As delicious as it was, I'm not used to eating things this sweet, so it was a little much for me. BUT I got cookies to-go and ooooh my god. I'm so happy I did. My favorite is the snickerdoodle... they didn't last long in the house!"}
{"text":"I went here awhile ago and have still been thinking about it! Loved the idea to build a cookie sandwich. Plenty of variety in ice creams and cookies. You can even have two different cookies on each side of the sandwich. It's also fairly inexpensive from what I remember!"}
{"text":"Fresh baked cookies and Thrifty Ice Cream (from OC). Have been here a handful of times in the past few months (Jan - June 2014). Upon first entering my impression was of a bad knockoff of Yogurt Land. Overpowering fluorescent lights and plastic furniture. While mostly white, the space felt somehow messy. No matter, I was quickly greeted with the aroma of fresh baked cookies and that makes everything better. Besides, as soon as I opened the door my kids had rushed to the ice cream counter to pick out an ice cream with day-glow color. The cookie selection is huge and the ice cream selection is decent, Thrifty Ice Cream doesn't make crazy mix combos. On first bite, you will be a believer. With other ice cream sandwiches the cookies might be too hard and cause the creamy frozen guts to be expelled so all you get is a crumbly mouthful of cookie. Or inversely the ice cream might be so hard that one bite delivers an arctic shock to the root of your teeth. Not so here, the soft cookies with the soft ice cream was perfect combination. I do have one knock- or piece of advice for the owners: clean your bathroom. I realize that if you get busy this might need to happen every other hour. Still, keep it clean, check it and check it often. Hire a janitorial person, I do NOT want the same person scrubbing toilets and making food. And if the bathroom is not clean, how can I trust the kitchen? Yelpers, go there and check the bathroom, if it's good, by all means enjoy a bit (600 calories?) of indulgence. Just plan ahead and have a salad for dinner beforehand."}
{"text":"Came here looking for ice cream, not so much for cookies. But they were all right there, displayed so deliciously in the front behind the counter, so of course I tried one. YUM! Super soft and chewy. However, I will say that the ice cream was misleading because it's just Thrifty ice cream. I was looking for some gourmet ice cream, I guess. This is the first time I've purchased Thrifty ice cream outside of a Rite Aid. It was delicious nonetheless because Thrifty ice cream is bomb.   All in all, a tasty treat that's hard to mess up. Knocking one star for lack of unique ice cream. I think this place could be a complete 5 star if they had signature ice cream, special to their store."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. It's a simple concept, but it works. Who doesn't like cookies and ice cream?   This place is practically the Diddy Riese of Las Vegas. Although they charge about $4 for an ice cream sandwich here compared to the $2 ice cream sandwich at Diddy Riese, the plus side is that they use thrifty ice cream. For those of you who've never tried Thrifty ice cream, you are missing out on life lol."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is bomb.com.  The cookies were so soft and delightful.  it was like an angel landed on my pallet and I devoured it with my teeth :O    This place is usually packed with a line, but it goes pretty fast.  Also, a yelp check-in gives you 0.50cents off your purchase!"}
{"text":"This should be a THE EXAMPLE STORE on how to build your business on Yelp!  I found my way here through yelp and word of mouth - coming HIGHLY recommended.  When you check in here, they give you a little discount when paying.  I haven't tried much variety, being that I am a creature of habit and when I find something good, why change it?  The chocolate brownie cookies with chocolate brownie ice cream is a guilty pleasure for sure!  They girl always reminds me that there is nuts in there, and I am absolutely fine with that.  Nice, clean place.  Friendly people.  Delicious ice cream sandwiches.  THRIFTY Ice Cream!  I've heard people rant and rave about this brand.    Give it a try, you won't regret it for sure!"}
{"text":"Friendly, delicious, and if you just want the ice cream just ask. But the cookies are amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here because I saw they had good ratings and it's not too far from when I'm at. Tried the animal cookie ice cream, sampled the green tea  and had a bite of the walnut cookie and everything was just okay. It's not bad and it's not awesome.... in between..."}
{"text":"I've been here more than twice and each time was always a great experience.  I never have to wait long, the staff is always ready to help from the moment I walk in. Although they don't have too many selections of ice cream, it's thrifty's ice creams so it's delicious! I do wish there were more options. The cookies are homemade and they're absolutely delicious!!! My favorites are the sugar cookies and the M&M cookies!  The price point is okay, not bad. There's always friendly staff, which makes all the difference. This  will definitely be the place I'll keep coming back to when I'm in the mood for ice cream :)"}
{"text":"Whenever you are feeling like dessert definitely hit this place!it will blow any negative feelings away!cookies are freshly baked and ice cream is so creamy!there are so many flavors that some times it's really hard to make a decision!!my recommendation is to get a cookie sandwich with at least one of the cookies being the brownie cookie...so good!!!"}
{"text":"My addiction for Thifty ice cream is over. Missing LA here and there!  One thing about it is the Thifty ice cream. This place puts a little spin on it, with the cookies. They also have shakes which my kids got. They got their usual Oreo cookie shake. It was delish. And I got my usual chocolate chip cookie and In between the goodness is chocolates malted crunch ice cream. I really wanted to take a gallon home but let's be real who is going to make the cookies for me. Lol!!   So if your looking for thrifty ice cream cone here to this awesome spot. Friendly and well stocked. There is always parking in the plaza."}
{"text":"This is a pretty interesting concept, it takes ice cream sandwiches to a new level. The main difference is that they use fresh baked cookies, which they have a variety of different kinds catering to basically anyone. There are a variety of ice cream choices available and the ice cream is made by Thrifty. I've never had Thrifty ice cream before, but it was actually pretty good.    The shop itself is small but a good size, there are plenty of places to sit both inside as well as outdoors if you wish to. It is well lit location with a very friendly staff who can help you make some decisions if you're unsure what you want or if it's your first time. The prices are also very reasonable.   They also have fresh baked cookies that you can buy if you don't want the ice cream, either single, half dozen, or even a dozen+  Don't forget to check in to get the 50cent discount, it's only good off of one receipt, so if you're with multiple people I suggest everyone checking in and pay separately!"}
{"text":"I got the groupon for this place and I loved it. I like the concept of the business and the store looks very inviting. The ice cream is nice and creamy but the cookies can be a little crunchy. The portions are pretty big and are only $3 per sandwich. Overall,  it definitely satisfies my sweet tooth cravings!"}
{"text":"So much thanks to Yelp and Yelpers for bringing Sweet Addiction to my attention! I've been craving ice cream sandwiches for the longest time, and this recent discovery has saved me a four-hour trip to L.A.'s Diddy Riese for my fix.   ICE CREAM SANDWICHES For my sandwich, I chose two different cookies: chocolate chip and fudge brownie (unsure if this is the name, but you'll know what I mean when you see it :). As for ice cream, I opted for the black cherry. Loved the chocolate chip and the brownie cookie was chocolaty indeed and a little on the decadent side. I'm glad I chose the black cherry ice cream, because it wasn't overly sweet, and I thought it complemented the cookies I chose. After eating one of these ice cream sandwich cookies, you might become really thirsty! No worries if that's the case, because you can buy waters and other beverages here to quench your thirst.   Another thing I like about Sweet Addiction is how they serve their sandwiches in bowls. Ok, might not sound like it's worth mentioning, but eating ice cream sandwiches can be messy, and a thin piece of paper and napkin doesn't do it for me.  SERVICE Great customer service. Employees here are nice and friendly, and I can't stress that enough.   OVERALL It might be a trek for most people to drive all the way to this side of town, but I think it's worth a try."}
{"text":"We love this place! The cookies are always sooooo good! So happy we found aThriftys ice cream place close to home!"}
{"text":"I loved the idea of this place before they even built it, and it met and exceeded every hope I had for it. The prices are great, and the cookies and ice cream are pretty good. The interior is clean and the service is very good. Definitely a good place to beat the heat on a hot day!"}
{"text":"Thrifty ice cream and fresh cookies make for a great addiction! Well done and I will be back. My fav selection snicker doodle cookies and chocolate chip ice cream."}
{"text":"This was a nice dessert. I dont even want to know the calorie count. Tasty tasty ice cream cookie sandwich! I came here after Thai Noodle house. They are in the same parking lot. Yelp has a .50 cents off ice cream sandwich check in offer!  It's a clean and bright shop. There is a shelf with about 10 different cookies; choc chip, choc chip and white choc chip, brownie, m&m's, peanut butter, etc. You mix 2 cookies and 1 scoop (who would get more than 1 scoop?). They have about 15 or so flavors of ice cream to choose from. I got the mint choc chipice cream with a choc brownie cookie and a mint choc chip cookie. WOW! Super filling. Like seriously, super duper filling. I'm pushed over the food edge here. But tassssssssty! The cookie almost falls apart, but doesnt. It is super soft so it adheres to the ice cream. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it so much, but I really did. I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"I met with a friend for Ice Cream and I must say this was the best damn Ice Cream Cookie Sandwich I've ever tasted. I like that the cookies are Homeade and Fresh. The young lady working behind the counter was Awesome! She greeted me as soon as I entered and you could tell she genuinely enjoyed her job."}
{"text":"Love the concept. Who doesn't like ice cream sandwiches? They did a great job of transforming the old Waffles Cafe space. It looks a million times better. The staff is super friendly and informative.  They serve Thrifty ice cream, which seems to be a big deal to anyone from California. To me... not so much. I grew up on the east coast. The ice cream, however, is very tasty. $3 will get you your choice of two cookies with two scoops of ice cream between them. I think that's a pretty good deal.  I got strawberry cheesecake ice cream with chocolate chip walnut cookies. The ice cream was smooth and creamy, the cookies were too hard. It was tough getting the sandwich out of the styrofoam container, so I just ate it out of the cup with a spoon instead. No biggie.  My son got the rainbow sherbert with chocolate chip cookies. He loved the ice cream and his cookies were perfect -- chewy and moist. Perfect for taking a bite out of without the ice cream shooting out the back. Just like his dad, he doesn't like to share his food, but I managed to try a little bit.  With ice cream sandwiches it's hard for anyone to top Coolhaus in LA, NY, etc, in my mind. They've got a ton of unique flavors. I'd love to see Sweet Addiction add some crazy flavors like that (whether they make it themselves or source it from someone else). In the meantime, I'll have no problem enjoying the ones they do have. It's a great, locally owned shop that I'll be happy to support."}
{"text":"I come for the cookies. So soft and delicious and baked to perfection. My pregnancy craving !"}
{"text":"Groupon brought us here with $8 to spend last night.  I got the Chocolate malted crunch ice cream sandwiched by homemade chocolate chip pecan cookies!   Yum yum.  Earl isn't much of a dessert person but he could not stop raving about his ice cream sandwich, which was the pistachio ice cream with the chocolate brownie.  Those were $3 each so we had another $2 to spend.  We spent it on 3 cookies and devour those cookies tonight after dinner and they were still chewy and delicious.  We will be coming back to Sweet Addiction when we are in the Spring Valley area!"}
{"text":"What a great concept!  The service was super-friendly.  The cookies are pretty good.  I tried the brownie ones and the chocolate chip.  I preferred the brownie ones.  Thrifty Rocky Road ice cream is always great.  I appreciate their late hours, too."}
{"text":"Eh.  We came later at night so maybe it was an off-time for them. It was not that busy when we came in and a lot of the tables had sticky residue left on it from earlier patrons. Our cookie ice cream sandwiches were okay. Thrifty's Ice Cream is always bomb though. The cookies were pretty hard. I don't feel too inclined to go back and try again because the experience was pretty forgettable."}
{"text":"The ice cream and service is great, but unfortunately the place is filthy, which is a big turn off for me!"}
{"text":"I have to knock my initial review down a couple stars.  This last visit I was using the last of one of my daily deal certificates before it expired.  I got two quarts of ice cream each packed by a different person.  That's where I have a problem.  One was fully packed which it should be for the $6.50 price and the other was not packed firm.  Air was taking up half the space and I could feel the difference so of course out of curiosity I weighed them when I got home and a huge weight difference showed up on my kitchen scale.     Also, on my first visit I thought the cookies were good but in subsequent visits there is just no consistency in what you are going to get and in my opinion Mrs. Fields makes a better tasting cookie.  In all fairness I have never ordered the ice cream sandwich option so in that case when you are combining the cookie and the ice cream maybe it's so mind blowingly delicious that you don't notice that the cookies are a tad dry and lack flavor.  I've noticed other stores in the Valley now selling Thrifty Ice Cream so I may get my fix of double malted crunch elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"I think there has to be something said about businesses who know what they want to do, are efficient about it, and offer good value, no matter how simple the concept may be.  Sweet Addiction is all about the ice cream sandwich - you can buy ice cream separately or a dozen cookies, but when you go into this store, it's all about the combination. And it's only $3!  I really enjoyed the Chocolate Malted Crunch, and all the cookies are really good and usually quite fresh as well. It's a great place for a quick small dessert."}
{"text":"This is another one of those places that I decided to give the \"benefit of the doubt\" and yes, I'm not impressed....Totally MEH! As mentioned in various reviews, great concept, but the execution falls short. Cookies are baked in big batches and  left out uncovered(health code violation?) ending up hard  and cold...pretty tiny too! Bite into the cold, hard cookie and your cold ice cream spills out the sides....FAIL!  Nothing is better than a properly made WARM, SOFT cookie sandwich with COLD ice cream...you have ovens and more than enough employees to change up your execution a bit...totally missing out on the temperature/texture contrast that WILL get people coming back for more. Don't take my word for it, CREAM in Berkley, CA has the same concept executed flawlessly-warm, bigger cookies out of the oven, with TWO scoops of ice cream for only $2!!!! No wonder they have a line out the door on a daily basis! They do it RIGHT.  I'm just being honest and telling it like it is, and when you have great ingredients, equipment, and labor to do it right, it is very disappointing when the end product is what you get here. I'll just stick to doing it my way, the right way...I got Thrifty close by in Aliante and I always keep cookie dough in the freezer...:p    ALOHA!!!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(76/100) \"Unsweetened Addiction\""}
{"text":"Poor quality cookies; nice staff. If you're looking for just something sweet, the items here work. However if you're big on taste, good flavor and quality, this is not the place. Unfortunately the cookies do not have a good flavor and the ice cream is just ok.  I tried multiple types of cookies, in hopes that my opinion would change...it did not. I've been to other places where both the ice cream and cookies are truly tasty. I gave one star for the delightful staff and cute layout of the shop."}
{"text":"Always a perfect go-to dessert option - can't go wrong with any combination of ice cream and homemade cookies."}
{"text":"This exciting new ice cream store is dangerously close to my house. I can feel it's sweet, addictive force draw me in as I drive past it every day. Perfect timing for some friends to visit because it gave me a great excuse to try something new with some good company!  Cookies are freshly baked every day and boy are they good! I see that Thrift's is a well-known ice cream, but I've never heard of it. Either way, it was delicious. It was very thick and creamy, it seemed a lot like custard.   I got the tuxedo cookie with birthday cake ice cream in a cup. The birthday cake was a little too sweet for me, so I ended up tossing it half way in. Check in to get a deal! Owner was very friendly and to top it off, everything is very well priced! Ice cream and a cookie cost me less than $2 (with the deal)!!"}
{"text":"We were here visiting from out of town and I wanted to find a sweet treat for the kiddos. Found a deal from groupon and despite a few minute drive, was totally worth it. SUPER YUMMY!! Cookies were perfectly soft, ice cream was delish it was beyond a perfect combination. Add to that the super friendly people here, it was worth coming here, groupon or not. Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"The cookies here are amazing. The ice cream cookie sandwiches that they are known for are ok. I know people love Thrifty's ice cream but I could not find a flavor I loved. It tasted like low grade ice cream.  Although their cookies are good, I'm not running back. The girl who assisted was super sweet and let me try like 5 flavors and was pleasant the whole time."}
{"text":"I'm not too fond of ice cream sandwiches...but after visiting this shop, I am. It's such a great place to take your kids, or a great place for you to grab some dessert with friends! If you're a kid at heart, you just might find this place is just as fun for you as your kids.  It surely took me back into time as I grew up with Thrifty ice cream. That was when their ice cream sold for $1 a scoop! So, I thought I'd pass down my childhood delights to my favorite 7 year old friend and few 7 year old minded older friends.  Don't let the ice cream casing deceive you, they have a WIDER selection list than that. They also have some gluten free offerings as well if you're not into GLUTEN or is allergic!   For $16 I was able to order two ice cream sandwiches and 2 sundaes. What a deal! I ordered the pineapple coconut ice cream with macadamia nut cookies. The cookies are all made in the shop so you know it's fresh! My little friend ordered a cotton candy ice cream (enticed by the vibrant colors i assume) with M&M cookies. What an awesome combo!   My childhood favorite was the malt ice cream which I am so glad they offer there, but I decided to try something different. The texture of the ice cream is so smooth and not too rich. It just melts so nicely in your mouth! I thought the cotton candy was going to be super sweet and extreme, but after stealing a bite or two from my friend, I was hooked. It wasn't too sweet. It actually had this nice creamy and milky taste too it, but it tastes JUST LIKE COTTON CANDY! Animal crackers flavor tastes JUST LIKE ANIMAL CRACKERS. My pineapple coconut ice cream with macadamia was such an awesome combo. Marissa also suggested that you try it with a brownie cookie.   The service was AMAZING! Marissa was so sweet, helpful, and patient with our horrible decision skills. Her service mimics one of what a vintage ice cream shop would probably be like. Very personal, sweet, helpful, and fun to talk to! The place is small, but it's just right. Cozy and homey. It doesn't have that horrid commercial feel to it. It really is like some time portal because coming there made me feel like I was five again.  DON'T FORGET TO USE YOUR CHECK IN OFFER! Check in on Facebook you get an offer too. Also, if you tag them on Instagram, you get an offer as well."}
{"text":"Awesome Fresh baked Cookie with Thrifty Ice Cream in between at a Good Value, What is there not to like? Staff is nice and Quick and Easy. They are definitely a place I would recommend trying."}
{"text":"I love Thrifty's Ice cream. Their chocolate chip cookies are so yummy. Staff was really nice. We bought the yelp deal, it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"The ice cream was very good.  The service was nice.  The problem is, the place is filthy.  Trash can over flowing.  The chairs full of ice cream and there was a huge hair on my chair.  They need to send someone from behind the counter to clean every few minutes."}
{"text":"Ummmmmmm...how come no one thought about this before?  It's freaking genius!  You pick two cookies which are HOMEMADE every day and come in a variety of flavors like chocolate chip, chocolate brownie, m&ms, peanut butter, snicker doodle, and mint chocolate.  Cookies are good, yes, but it gets better!  Then you choose your choice of THRIFTY BRAND ice cream and they make it all into a glorious ice cream sandwich!!!!!!!  I went today because it is national ice cream sandwich day and what kind of an American would I be if I didn't partake in this important holiday?  Because of the holiday, they were offering buy 2 sandwiches, get the third free.  Well, I am an ice cream addict, but I'm not that much of a pig, so they also told me that if you check in on Facebook or Yelp, you get 50 cents off your order!  Bringing the grand total for a one scoop ice cream sandwich to $2.70!  Pretty good deal right there.  Also, if you're not into sandwiches, you can get the cookies by themselves and/or the ice cream by itself.  It it's too overwhelming, the nice gals working will help you out with some suggestions.  The fact that this place is very close to my house could be a good thing or a bad thing."}
{"text":"The ice cream cookie sandwich is delicious!!!! Favorite dessert place in Vegas"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great service! I will bring in ice cream sandwiches from here to my clients and I am instantly the coolest person in the office!! Both locations are wonderful to take the family for a sweet treat :)"}
{"text":"I live for Thriftys ice cream! From double malt crunch to black cherry and yes the occasional bubble gum or pecan praline.   And I love a good cookie sandwich, a good chocolate chip cookie stuffed with Vanilla ice cream from the ice cream truck was always my first pick. But I'm sad to say that the cookies here are not for me. they are really tasty and good quality cookies but there not good cookies for an ice cream sandwich.   There to soft, to chewy for a cookie sandwich, when you bite in to them they just crumble and smush into the ice cream. theres no foundation, it would help if they froze the cookies first or uses a batter that made them less soft."}
{"text":"Homemade cookies that can be purchased individually, by the half dozen or by a baker's dozen. They have about 10 different flavors of cookies! These cookies are also used to make ice cream sandwiches because they serve Thrifty ice cream here. My daughter loved the cotton candy ice cream. I loved the chocolate chip cookies!"}
{"text":"Incredible ice cream! Best ice cream I have had in Vegas. Even better (in my opinion) than anywhere on the strip. Located on Fort Apache between Tropicana and Hacienda. Highly recommend them for ice cream and/or their homemade cookies!"}
{"text":"Places like this are the reason I love yelp.  So you go into this little bitty strip-mall store across from a Del Taco and a Walmart plaza and are greeted with charming yet sparse decor. You're also verbally greeted (or at least my family was) by the proprietor and spouse who were both extremely helpful (and charming).  An illiterate person could successfully order here, and yet it's a little overwhelming. There's cookies on display on a rack above the counter and ice cream in the standard refrigerated ice-cream display. It should be simple, but everything looks good. I had similar problems at Mad Hatter Cupcakes, which I also recommend. But to be sure, these are the best kind of problems. My wife, child, and I all ordered combos which don't actually make sense (black cherry and chocolate chip? why not?) and got a snazzy blue soda I'd never heard of before. Excellent stuff.  Cookies were excellent. We didn't ask for fresh, but they certainly tasted fresh. The Thrifty(?) Ice cream was superb. I'd not heard the hype, but I know great ice cream and this was good stuff. The stunner was that those ice cream sandys were 3 bones apiece. It felt too inexpensive: I want this place around for a while. Place was hopping  while we were in on a Sunday late-afternoon though.   They have a sizable and largely-empty beverage cooler with a variety of milk on hand. This is brilliant, too many sugary-starch castles have limited milk options (I'm looking at you Krispy-Kreme) but it'd be nice to see that filled with some of the amazing sodas from across the street at Rocket-Fizz, or some other beverage delights. Minor details.  Go, go, and go again: why hasn't anyone thought of this before?"}
{"text":"Cheap ice cream. Its for kids. Not worth the calories at all. Its rite aid  store ice cream (thrifty!)  Staff was working hard and very nice. We are super disappointed we splurged tonight and it was so not worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm a little obsessed with this place. I'll be honest and say I've had better ice cream, but they have a good variety of cookies and the great customer service gives them the 5th star. I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"Flawless execution.  Cookies are tasty and freshly baked, the ice cream is sweet and cold. Friendly staff, fast service and cheap.  Cleaner or better tables and chairs would be nice but other than that this is a great place and perhaps only place for an ice cream sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Great selection of Thrifty ice cream and delicious cookies baked with love by one of the owners. THE COOKIES ARE SO GOOD. They also have various fancy bottled sodas and milk. All very reasonably priced minus the cartons of milk. They get ya if you are one of those people who needs milk with their cookies. I also appreciate that they are open until 10-11 when the real sweet cravings hit most of us. Mmm, nighttime guilty pleasures."}
{"text":"100% delish! Had the make your own sundae and my girls had ice cream sandwiches. They were awesome. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"How can you give anything less than 5 stars for a place that bakes their cookies from scratch everyday, and serves Thrifty ice cream? You can smell the cookies when you walk in, and it's intoxicating! Great selection of cookies and ice cream, I'm kinda a boring person when it comes to mixing ice cream with something else, so I went with vanilla (I know, I know) and my favorite cookie (which these are hard to find) oatmeal chocolate chip, and had them make a shake. So good! The girl at the counter (believe she was the owner) was so kind to us, friendly personality, reminded us to check in to get our .50 cents off. Prices are very reasonable as well. I wish them lots of luck! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Three words- chocolate malted crunch. Absolutely the best ice cream flavor. Ever. And these guys serve it up on  freshly baked cookies? For like four bucks? That's a sweet deal if you ask me. My husband and I even picked up a nice little piece of framed artwork by a local tattoo artist on one of our visits. I am all about supporting locally-owned businesses, and it is really nice to see local businesses supporting local artists....All in all, this is a great place. Oh, and if you check in on Facebook, they will give you $.50 off."}
{"text":"After much anticipation and hype it was finally my turn to pay Sweet Addiction a visit. They really do live up to their name because I am officially addicted! I had the ice cream sandwich consisting of white chocolate chip cookies with strawberry cheesecake ice cream. The cookies, which are made on site are delicious! These cookies are the type you would get as a welcome gift when you move into a neighborhood. Homemade taste and appearance, get my drift? The ice cream is thifty's and they pack a good amount in there. There is also a 50. cent off when you check into yelp, but the prices here are pretty reasonable.  I also ordered 3 cookies to go because it's 3 for $2, beats the price of Mrs. Fields! The inside is really clean with neon colors making it give off that happy vibe. Eating and seeing happy would make anyone come back, especially me!"}
{"text":"$3 build your own ice cream sandwiches. There are a ton of combinations, and the portion size is huge. I can't believe this even exists, let alone for the price they are charging. I had a cookies n cream ice cream with a tuxedo and chocolate fudge cookie. We just had a big meal, but in just about any situation this would have been enough for me to share.   I hope these come to the East Coast soon."}
{"text":"Had to give the cookie ice cream sandwich shop a chance.  Such a great idea.  I had some medieval madness ice cream between two chocolate chip cookies.  My cookie was warm and slightly melted the ice cream.  Just right.  Make sure to check out the \"additional ice cream flavors\" printed to the left of the counter... in case you want vanilla or cookies and cream.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I just had the greatest peanut butter cookie I have ever had.  With the World now full of frozen yogurt joints that spit out the same stuff over and over, Sweet Addiction has something fresh and unique that you can't get anywhere else in town.    I ordered an ice cream sandwich on two peanut butter cookies and it was absolutely outstanding.  Having grown up in the Midwest, I did not know anything about Thrifty Ice Cream, and now I see why everyone raves about it.    This place really took me back to my childhood when ice cream was ice cream and cookies were homemade.  This place deserves to be successful because it serves unique delicious concoctions that you simply cannot get anywhere else.  I got two ice cream sandwiches each on two cookies and it was less than 5 bucks.  Bravo to the owner who is opening a true local business and not just someone throwing a franchise into a stripmall."}
{"text":"The Peanut Butter cookies are to die for! The service is great and the place is clean! Win win! The brownie cookie was a little too hard for my taste but everything else's was delicious!"}
{"text":"Dude ...  Have they always had milkshakes?   These things are sooooooooo good!  Fucking aye.   I still prefer the white chocolate macadamia nut with coconut ice cream. Now, I can just drink it. (Chalk it up to the islander in me.)   They need straws with a larger circumference. Those tiny red straws ain't gonna cut, bud."}
{"text":"Yup, As good as it gets! Soft delicious cookies, Yummy Thrifty ice cream, and an incredibly friendly staff! Also, make sure to check in via Facebook, they apply a generous discount to their loyal customers, and they remind you to check in during check out, other greedy business's dont do that. This staff must truly care! All in all An awesome inovation i cant wait to return later tonight... IM ADDICTED!!!"}
{"text":"My mother taught me that a small sandwich for lunch was a nutritious mid-day meal.  She was right, but she never knew about Sweet Addiction.  My mid-day meal was an ice cream sandwich made with two fresh cookies and a nice amount of ice cream.  It makes absolute nutritional sense to me!  On entering the store, I'm sure I had that \"deer in the headlights\" look.  One of the staff  immediately asked me if it was my first time there.  Answering in the affirmative, she explained what they sell and how it's served.  She was wonderful, and I felt like a long time valued customer almost from the get go.  That's good customer service for a place that's only been opened two weeks.  After the explanation, I ordered a cookie sandwich with chocolate malted crunch ice cream.  I opted to get two of the same cookies rather than mix.  I need to save that option for my next visit.  I chose the chocolate brownie cookie.  These cookies are marvelous.  It's a soft brownie in the shape of a cookie with a rich, chocolatey taste.    The cookie sandwich is served in a styrofoam bowl, so if you're a drip like me, they go into the bowl and not on the table or your napkin or worse--your pants.  Even so, I still had chocolate fingers and I probably had some chocolate in my beard.  They have bathrooms so you can wash off the excess you can't lick off--well not politely anyway.  I spoke with the owner about hiking and his beginning mountain biking and I felt like I was talking with people I already knew.  It's a very comfortable, easy place to go.  And, it certainly is addictive.  I may have to switch now and then the Wallyworld I go to so as not to be tempted to make this a weekly stop.  I'll have to hike extra this week to work off this nutritious mid-day meal.  Thanks, mom!  And, thanks to the Yelpers that discovered this place and let me in on it.  I'm glad they didn't keep it a secret.  Happy mountain biking and hiking (for the ladies of the store)!"}
{"text":"First time here and love it!! So many different cookies and ice cream flavor/combos to choose from. The cookies were chewy (which I love) and ice cream was great!!! You just have to be cautious because these goodies are addicting and you'll find yourself having one all of the time! Prices are more reasonable than Hagaan Daaz, DQ and Baskin Robbins (both cookie sandwiches were $7 and some change total). Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"I came in here for the first time and ordered one scoop of Chocolate Malted Crunch, and 1 White Chocolate Macadamia Nut cookie.  Since I checked in on Yelp, I had $0.50 off.  My total came out to an amazing $1.89.  I couldnt' believe it when the cashier told me.  Everyone in the store is super nice and courteous, and the way to order is so simple.  Order your favorite Thrifty's ice cream scoop, order 2 cookies to make a sandwhich, or order it on the side!  And viola!!!! Yumminess in your mouth on a hot summer night!  They have some small seating inside, but we took it outside to eat it on the sidewalk in the parking lot.  This place gets pretty packed!  I think they need to add patio seating!  No more Rite Aids to purchase Thrifty's ice cream and there aren't many places that serve it these days.  And at this price!!!! You can't beat it.  I'm so happy this placed popped up!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just crave a sweet treat, so sweet addiction fills a definite need.   I'm actually not a big sweets lover but a chewy cookie is high in my list!  This place delivered!! Yay! Chewy cookies.   I had oatmeal butterscotch cookies with pecan praline ice cream sandwiched inside. Delightful. Utilized my check in offer and filled my belly with sugar for a mere $2.70.   I'll go back. Cheap, cute, friendly, tasty.  May just have a sweet addiction now!"}
{"text":"I realize now that the main reason I like Thrifty ice cream is because it reminds me of going to the drug store and getting a scoop with my mom when I was a kid, not because the ice cream is actually good. (side note, Janel S says she used to go when it was $1/scoop - when was that, yesterday??? When I was a kid, it was .40 a scoop, and I'm not THAT old!) Anyway, back to the sandwiches. I loooove ice cream sandwiches and so I thought these would be extra good because you get to pick out your flavors. Unfortunately, even though they have lots of good-sounding flavors, none of the ice creams are that great. Second, a good selection of cookies doesn't really matter because they're all sitting out and hard. Third, the way the 'sandwich' is constructed, you can't eat it like a sandwich at all. The cookies are way too far apart and the ice cream doesn't spread all around. So basically, it's ok, but I had high hopes that the cookies would be good and soft (and I think they should be a lot thinner if they're used in a sandwich) and the ice cream would be delicious like I remembered. I drive by quite often, so I may be back in to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Saw this place on groupon! Paid 6 dollars and got 10 dollars worth, very good ice cream and cookies!"}
{"text":"Thifty's Ice Cream is a childhood favorite. Put that in between two fresh made cookies and I'm on cloud 9. Been here a few times and never had hard cookies or ice chunks in my ice cream like some other comments.   If you want cheap you can go to DQ. That's all I have to say for those complaining on price."}
{"text":"Goodbye waistline......  And that sums it up!!! This business is not for the faint hearted. The name could not be more spot on, Sweet Addiction, Cookies and Ice Cream, not to be confused with Janes Addiction as my other yelpers HH and RM tried to confuse me.  Located in a regular strip mall next to a few unusual 20 something stores, just on South Apache and West Reno Ave. It is not hard to miss this place with a pretty easy to read sign out front.  Shakes, flavored milk, ice cream products are all served here, but the main attraction is the cookie sandwiches. Ordering a customized sandwich to for fill any sweet toothed at heart.  Going with the rocky road ice cream with m&m's cookie on one side and the chocolate cookie on the other, I truly believe that this would satisfy my inner fatboy! Unfortunately it wasn't to be. Although a interesting concept and half decent ice cream, I felt like this business missed the mark and went a little overkill. The cookies were not as fresh as I thought and the ice cream was run of the mill.  Although this place is unique, I feel now ive been there and done that. Nothing really grabbed me to say come back other than the day I feel I need to eat my feelings.  Overall  Cleanliness: 3-5 Price: $ Food: 3-4 Back again: Nope (that's a lie, if friends want to come here I can't stop them)"}
{"text":"Tasty treats and great pricing. What's not to love?!?  A variety of freshly baked homemade cookies which you can combine in any variety with the various flavors of Thrifty ice cream. You could literally get a different treat combo here ever time for months. 2 single scoop cookie sandwiches and 2 milks was under $10, so the pricing is very reasonable.  I liked that they had the nostalgic treats mixed in with new technology as they were using iPad's with the Square credit card service as registers.   My only complaint was they were a little slow, obviously not expecting a summer evening rush about 9pm, but they should have being newly opened in my book. Otherwise, they would have 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"The best place for dessert. Ice cream is delish and the cookies are some of the best I've had. Also a good amount of food for the price."}
{"text":"Nostalgia. I'm an 80's kid so I came for the Thrifty's ice cream. I've actually been here a few times but tonight's visit was different in a good way. I got circus animal flavor ice cream with snickerdoodle and sugar cookies to make my sandwich. Because who's counting calories tonight...not me. F a diet. At least for tonight.   In the past the cookies were a bit on the hard side, not the best texture for a ice cream sandwich. Tonight's cookies were soft which made for a perfect sandwich. Their \"scoop\" of ice cream is Huge. I'm guessing people may complain of price (this ain't the 80's anymore and we must get over the 25 cent a scoop deal) but when you're getting a product/treat like this you forget about $'s sometimes.   Staff is friendly. Place is kept clean. Good amount of space. Bonus that they have the table style arcade game set up and cool unique sodas in their drink fridge. All I need is some MJ, Madonna, Boy George, Cindy Lauper on blast on the radio, some Ronald Reagan on the tube, some girls with biker shorts big aquanet hair and fanny packs and maybe i can give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely addicting!!! Their ice cream is so yummy and fresh! Cookies are delicious! I takes my kids here every week after school and they love it!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Strawberry cheesecake ice cream smushed between two amazing sugar cookies? Hell yes!! And for only $4? Holla! The girl who helped me had excellent customer service she even paid me a very nice compliment (I wish I got her name so she could get due credit). With the store located about a mile away from my home I expect to become a regular. Heck, even if my home was much further away I'd probably make the trip. I definitely recommend everyone try this place. Wonderful product and kind, helpful employees!"}
{"text":"I wasn't going to have one because I'm not a huge fan of cookie ice cream sandwiches but they had a BOGO deal if you text them so - why not? Boy am I glad I did! The ice cream is delicious and creamy and you get to pick your own fresh bakes cookies! You can choose 2 different cookies! WOW!   Tip: It is more worth it to order a whole sandwich and split it than ordering 2 single cookie sandwiches. They put a LOT more ice cream on the whole sandwich."}
{"text":"I love this place... Simply put! The cookies are fresh made and the ice creams are delicious."}
{"text":"I came here on a hot Friday afternoon. I really can't comment on their ice cream sandwiches because I had just gotten a scoop of the Black Cherry THRIFTY ice cream! MY favorite flavor! The place is cute inside and customer service was good. They use iPads for their POS so that's pretty cool! I didn't give this place 5 stars because it wasn't anything extraordinary out of this world type thing....maybe next time I will try and ice cream sandwich and see if that blows me out of this world!"}
{"text":"This place in incredible! I went here when my little sister was in town who is 14, but has the biggest sweet addiction (hah) out of anyone I've ever met. At a very young age she decided she had a \"dessert stomach\"- a separate stomach solely for desserts that predictably enough, is never full. I'm bigger on savory- I'd take an appetizer at a restaurant over dessert any day.   Anyhow, it's 9pm and she has a craving for cookies and ice cream. I'm almost resigned to going to the grocery store to pick up a pint and some pre-made cookie dough when I decide to Yelp the combo first. Sweet Addiction pops up and specializes in (whaddya know?!) cookies and ice cream. AND they're open until 10pm! Awesome!  So we hustle on over, they're very busy inside their little store. I see they have Thrifty ice cream. Yes!! Then I see their cookie selection. It had definitely been hit hard as we were there late and they all sort of looked.. Well.. Like over cooked slightly burnt, gonna-be-crunchy cookies. Sorry, Sweet Addiction. This is, however, a perfect example of why you should never judge a book by its cover or a cookie by its color!  These are the best cookies I've ever had! Sorry, mom. They are soft and chewy and taste oh-so-homemade! The walnut chocolate chip has finely diced walnuts, so it's a little hard to tell they're there. The brownie cookie is a fantastic chocolatey chew and taste just like boxed brownie mix (the best kind, of course.)  I've been here three times now and can see myself returning again and again. I think Sweet Addiction may have done for me what their name claims to. They should partner with the gym down the street."}
{"text":"Music was disturbing loud rap, not appropriate to bring your kids to. Place was filthy. Server were courteous. Shake was ok."}
{"text":"Great place to go when you're craving an ice cream sandwich. Cookies were fresh and chewy. I had one brownie cookie and one chocolate chip with cake batter ice cream. Awesome sweet tooth fix!! Will be back. Also when I went to pay the lady at the counter asked if I wanted my buy one get one free.. Not sure if it was just a promo or a certain day/time type of thing! If you're planning on ordering for many, call ahead to check on the 2 for 1 deal!"}
{"text":"The cookies and ice cream were totally AMAZING!! It reminded me of Diddy Riese in Westwood Village in Los Angeles.  Even though Diddy Riese's was bigger and cheaper, I would actually prefer this one.  The cookies are very delicious where every bite you can taste the softness and the chocolate. The ice cream is one of my favorite brands Thrifty's too! I'd recommend this for people with a sweet tooth and people visiting."}
{"text":"Sweet Addiction has done something amazing here -- they managed to scoop up the nostalgia of Thrifty ice cream, smother it between some freshly-baked cookies, and smack me in the face with deliciousness.  The folks here weren't kidding around with their store name. There has to be something around here to satisfy even the sweetest of tooths. They have a variety of items here, including something more unique: frozen hot chocolate. However, for my initial visit, I had to try their signature cookie ice cream sandwich.  I went with strawberry cheesecake ice cream with some oatmeal raisin cookies. The cookies literally just came out of the oven. They were warm, soft, and wrapped around the ice cream nicely. The ice cream slowly fused with the cookie as it slowly began to melt. Combining these two powers seemed unreal. I was expecting Captain Planet to come around at any second.  I took a bite and was floored by shock. This was delicious.  It's not often that I'm excited about a new place, but an amazing staff, coupled along with an extremely reasonably priced (and delicious) menu is enough to keep me coming back for more.  Pro-tip: Check to see if any cookies just came out of the oven. Those go so well with the ice cream."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade cookies and a nice selection of options. It smelled so good when we walked in. The place is super clean and the guy who helped us was very nice and patient while my daughter and I made our choices. Great prices too! We got a dozen cookies for $9+ tax."}
{"text":"So during dinner at Firefly, Vanessa asked where we were doing dessert. It had to be somewhere on Ft Apache since we were drinking earlier and she could just walk home. So I suggested this place. It's really easy to order. They offer all the flavors from thrifty ice cream (remember to look at the flavors written on the wall, not just in the display case). I got an ice cream sandwhich with coconut pineapple ice cream between white chocolate macadamia nut cookies. Super moist cookies with a huge scoop of ice cream in the middle. Nothing wrong with that!!! The owner looked pleased that a group of yelpers came in with the 50 cent off check in. I don't come here unless I'm on this side of town, but I will be back."}
{"text":"I will never go to this place again. Cookies were rock hard and the employees were terrible."}
{"text":"Ice cream sandwiches! My roommate and I just had lunch next door at the Thai place and decided that we finally had some time to try this place. It's small, cozy and homey inside and they have various flavors of THRIFTY ice-cream to choose from, even some more in back. I'm a huge fan of cookies and ice-cream so I'm really glad this place opened up near my side of town."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an ice cream sandwich today! Pumpkin ice cream between two snicker doodle cookies! Did not disappoint. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Treat yourself Tuesday!!! $1 off your ice cream sandwich what a sweet way to spend your evening! They have your main ice cream favorites; but it's the cookies that you want to come here for !!!! They are delicious. Mine were even a little warm when I got them EXTRA yummy!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another try... Cookies are super soft and go perfectly with the ice cream. Sugar cookie was tasty. No complaints other than that the place was just a little dirty, but it was the end of the night so it makes sense!"}
{"text":"just a regular ice cream place with a twist of cookie. Must admit the cookie was really good."}
{"text":"I love cookies and cream like a fat kid loves cake. You can't lose coming to a place like this. I mean, I don't think I've ever really had bad ice cream or cookies in my life. So combine Thrifty's ice cream with Mrs. Field's Cookies, you have a winner in my book (It's not Mrs. Field's cookies but WAYYY better). Add in the fresh clean look of Yogurtland, I think this could be a sustainable business model.   We just need coffee!!!"}
{"text":"Cool place for huge ice cream sandwiches. Walls were scraped and pretty beat up. Long line and one person working. Other than that you really get a lot for your money."}
{"text":"this place has a similar concept to a few places in California  for example:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/diddy-riese-cookies-los-angeles#query:ice%20cream%20cookie http://www.yelp.com/biz/cream-berkeley-2  I've only been to CREAM and it is 100x better than sweet addiction.  first of all it is more expensive than CREAM. it is $3.50 for a ice cream sandwich and $0.90 for a cookie. sounds cheap in comparison to a cookie at Mrs. Fields or ice cream at Baskin Robbins, but compared to the places in California, it is expensive ($2.00 sandwich if you pay cash and $0.65 for cookies)  2nd- the cookies were not good. the staff had said all the cookies were chewy but really they were borderline crunchy/hard cookies. not so great for the cookie sandwich experience. for a satisfying cookie sandwich experience you can't have a cookie crumbling in your hands after the first bite.  3rd- I don't think they outlined well enough what to do when you walk in. there is no \"line\" and the signs aren't that helpful. employees didn't explain anything or ask us if it was our first visit. after my sister ordered and paid she heard someone else ordering two different cookies for their sandwich. no one had informed her that was an option.  4th- got the praline and cream ice cream. nuts tasted old. soggy, not good.  positives: open late for that late night sweet tooth craving. fun furniture. some room to sit. takes credit cards with no minimum.  will probably not be returning unless I'm craving a scoop of thrifty ice cream"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to this fine establishment for the past year. They serve quality products at great prices! They give back to the community and find every way possible to give you a discount on your purchase. This means a lot to me since my family and I go there about 3 times a week!! Born and raised in Vegas, I've never been to a better ice cream parlor in sin city!"}
{"text":"Yummy! The prices are so great and the cookie sandwiches are AMAZING! I would go everyday if I could. Haha"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Great ice cream. Choose your cookies to make an ice cream sandwich. Got to use my first yelp discount here!! Woohoo"}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't do a review after only one visit. However, Sweet Addiction is very far from where I live. Probably about a 25 minute drive with light traffic. So, with that being said - it is a good thing Sweet Addiction is so far from my house because if they were close I'd be here every weekend getting my sweet tooth on.   First off, it's such a novel concept - ice cream, cookies... who doesn't love ice cream and cookies? Then you put them together - and BAM - well of course, awesome ice cream sandwich with wickedly awesome, fresh baked cookies!  When my fiance and I arrived here on a Sunday evening it was not too busy, although there were a few families eating at the tables when we walked in. The staff was very friendly and were giving samples to the customers in front of us in line. I decided on the chocolate chip cookies (mostly because some had just come out of the oven) and the mocha almond fudge ice cream. My fiance got the cake batter ice cream with the M&M cookies. He said his cookies were a bit tough, but mine were awesomely perfect. Having just come out of the oven they were soft and the little bit of heat gently melted down my delicious Thrifty ice cream so I could squish the sandwich enough to get it dispersed evenly.  I have never heard of Thrifty ice cream until this shop opened, but apparently it is very popular in California? I noticed no difference between it and other specialty ice creams I've had. I mean, it was good, but the best ice cream I've had in my life? Probably not.  Overall - such a great concept. Very good portions for a very cheap price. Both mine and my fiance's sandwiches came to just a little over 5 bucks! That's a steal."}
{"text":"Pretty bummed. Came in at 930. Ordered a shake and the girl was half joking but said, \"seriously, you ordered a shake? I'm cleaning everything up right now.\" It wasn't funny and I honestly want to throw this shake away - I'm so irritated."}
{"text":"What's not to like? Soft, gooey cookies and a scoop of ice cream?? Deeeeelicious. They have a good variety of flavors, so I'm sure there's a combo for everyone. We tried cappuccino ice cream between a chocolate chip and a brownie cookie. It was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I started a meetup.com group dedicated to desserts, and two of the members suggested this place. I had never heard of it, and shame on me for that!! This place is amazeballz!!!  I went at 9pm on a Thursday night on my way to the gym. Don't judge. Anyway, it was jam packed!! I can't imagine what it is like on the weekends.  I love the concept. Pick your cookies. Pick your ice cream flavor. And, they instantly whip you up an awesome ice cream sandwich on the spot. There are lots of choices for both. And, they will give samples if you are undecided.  I had white chocolate macadamia cookies with pineapple coconut ice cream and hubby had the brownie cookie with 3 Musketeer ice cream. Both of us gave A+ to our selections, and were already planning what we were going to get next time!  Cost for both was $7. And, portions were large (we had the single scoops). I cannot imagine what a double or triple scoop looks like.  If you happen to be a purist, you can have just cookies or just ice cream.  They are, also, open later which I love.  Stop whatever you are doing and check this place out!!"}
{"text":"The cookies are just like homemade, only better because you don't have to bake them. Then they go crazy by taking a giant scoop of yummy ice cream and making a giant cookie ice cream sandwich.  Also, cheaper than a bowl of frozen yogurt which is a big plus when you are treating the kiddies. I thought it was great."}
{"text":"What a great place to find just as the weather is starting to warm up. Ice cream, cookies, ice cream cookie sandwiches. Yummm.  Lots of options."}
{"text":"Me & the little guy went here on a Mommy&Son date on 'National Ice Cream Day' and we loved it! They were playing disney songs and have a mini old school arcade-type game inside, so my son immediately loved it. They serve Thrifty's ice cream and you have the option to \"Sandwhich\" your scoops between two of their (different flavored) cookies! I love that their cookies stay super soft and don't get all hard from the cold ice cream. The young lady that helped us was super sweet and encouraged me to have samples of whatever we wanted. Their store is clean, has a fresh-modern look to it, friendly staff, and delicious ice cream/cookies. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"When I found out a few months ago that there's a place down the street from my house that serves Thrifty's, I had to check it out. Since then, anytime I have a sweet tooth, my first inclination is to come to Sweet Addiction and get a scoop of the Rainbow Sherbet. As far as types of ice cream flavors and cookies go, there's a ton of options to suit any flavor palette. The service is good as well, every employee I've interacted with is polite and friendly. My only qualm is the establishment itself--I think the store would greatly benefit from a renovation and decor makeover. The color scheme, decorations, and table setup look haphazard, and most of the time I take my ice cream to go because it's not very pleasing aesthetic-wise to sit in the store. Overall, if you haven't visited this place, I would recommend it solely for the Thrify's ice cream."}
{"text":"Yummy great place to take a break from the heat."}
{"text":"After a hefty amount of msg at thai style noodle house (next door), nothings satisfies that sweet craving more than 2 delicious fresh baked cookies and ice cream.  This place has multiple types of cookies you can choose from for your ice cream sandwich.  Cookies were soft and fresh as well.  Defintely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with ice cream? Well you can't, not at this place. Thriftys pecan praline is my favorite."}
{"text":"Love it here, but maybe the person responsible for opening the store should get here on time. 1:05 not open then walked up saying opening now. Other folks waiting too. Of course just being open at 1:00pm. Or 1:05 as the case may be, no fresh cookies.  now the guy is telling the other customers about his own separate cookie business"}
{"text":"Anything with the word \"sweet\" in the name grabs my attention. I wandered in and was greeted by a sweet girl and an amazing smell.           I take the kids there for floats and sundaes, I bring dozens of cookies to my clients a week, I eat more ice cream than a lady should and I can't leave that place without a mint chocolate chip cookie. They're the best!!           My clients always have great reviews of the cookies I bring them and if they're happy... I'm happy. I'll keep coming back, count on it for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  It really is a sweet addiction for me. & note to self: gotta limit, I WILL get fat from coming here so much haha"}
{"text":"Whether you're looking for something sweet, looking for dessert, or just craving some ice cream or cookies or both, this is the place to go!  They serve Thrifty's ice cream and if you grew up on Thrifty's ice cream (like I did), then you already know how good their ice cream is.  They have 20+ flavors to choose from and even use the Thrifty's style cylindrical scooper.  There's also a variety of cookies, which taste just like soft, chewy homemade cookies!  I let one sit out over night and it was still soft and tasty the next day, like it just came out of the oven.  Their staff is great and friendly, too!  Lastly, the prices are great.  An ice cream sandwich (2 cookies and a scoop of ice cream) is only $3, while a scoop of ice cream alone is only $1.50.  They utilize iPads as their registers along with the Square app and credit card readers - pretty neat!  I feel like I will become a regular here :)."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here last week and while it wasnt her first time it was mine and I am hooked! As a sucker for anything Mother's Animal Cookie, I was an instant fan of the frosted animal cookie flavor! Cant wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"Best Cookies on the world, Couldn't believe what i was tasting!!!! Lots of choices to pick from my favorites are the oatmeal ones."}
{"text":"At the end of a meal, I'm always the one saying, \"No, thank you,\" to dessert.  And then Sweet Addiction opened, and here I am ready to go whenever someone mentions it.  Cookies...my only dessert weakness.  Before Sweet Addiction, the only dessert that I would purposefully save room for would be pizzookies from BJ's Pizzeria.  Thankfully, I can have something just as good, for much cheaper, and closer to home...  I did not grow up on Thrifty Ice Cream, but I can see the appeal.  3 Musketeers?  Animal Crackers?  Cotton Candy?  No, I did not know these ice cream flavors existed, but I am happy to have discovered this.  I'm sure that at some point I'll make my way through all the flavors, everything I've had has been delicious and tasted just like the base ingredients.  When it comes to cookies, I'm easy and go with chocolate chip and M&M.  Good ice cream sandwiched between soft, home baked cookies...that's all you really need to take from this review."}
{"text":"Love this place! Tried it for the first time yesterday & I was impressed . They let you sample whatever you want and the ice cream is great. The cookies were also really good . The building is a little small but I'd never plan on eating there soo it doesn't bother me lol  This is my new spot lol"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely dangerous (in a good way!) I try very hard to stay away from sweets, but when my daughter comes to town she insists on going to Sweet Addiction and I have no choice but to oblige. :-) ...and I love every moment of it. It's a cute clean little place... the ice cream is delish and the cookies taste fresh. A great treat!"}
{"text":"Best cookies on Thrifty ice cream? Yes please! We had a really good time delighting on all the different flavors we got."}
{"text":"It's very simple -- cookies & ice cream. They have cookies baked to perfection. They have Thrifty's ice cream, 'nough said.  I don't care for cookie ice cream sandwiches & prefer separating the cookie & the ice cream because it's easier to eat. They also give more ice cream doing that.  The brownie cookie is my favorite. If I was craving cookies & didn't want store-bought ones, I'd go to Sweet Addiction."}
{"text":"Yummy ice cream and cookies. Very friendly staff. Oh and fun toppings!  Add thrifty too!"}
{"text":"If you happen to have a sweet tooth, this is a go to spot. I was craving an ice cream sandwich and this place definitely hit the spot.  I got an m&m ice cream cookie sandwich with chocolate malted crunch ice cream. The cookies... Well, they could be much more softer than they were. It gets hard to eat when the cookie is so hard because they ice cream starts to squish out and the whole sandwich falls apart. But, the ice cream is what I love.  They use thrifty since cream, which I love. The chocolate malted crunch isn't too chocolatey and it has just the right amount of crunchies!   They have cute seating with one little mini arcade game inside. They also have a table outside which was nice because I wanted fresh air. It's also open pretty late when you're having late night munchies! I would definitely come back! They need to make softer cookies though."}
{"text":"Prices are going up and the scoops are getting smaller every time i take the family here.  Might need to find a new ice cream place soon :(  Before pic... after pic..."}
{"text":"I love this ice cream shop & so does my family! This place is super inexpensive & delicious. I adore their ice cream cookie sandwiches. They make fresh baked cookies & have probably about 10 different cookie flavors, if not more. The choices of Thrifty ice cream is great & the scoops of ice cream they give are big. The staff here is excellent & I love taking my family here for a sweet treat!!"}
{"text":"Fresh baked cookies & ice cream...how can you go wrong? This place is dangerous if you're watching calories, though. But for a splurge, it is nothing short of perfection! This place is dessert heaven."}
{"text":"The cookies are amazing!  The icecream is also very good. The prices are also very reasonable.  We always look forward to going"}
{"text":"Many flavors to choose from but the ice cream is Thrifty ice cream s( rite aid ice cream) so not the best quality. The cookies are the best part and they even offer gluten free cookies!"}
{"text":"I was looking up ice cream on Yelp and found this place.  Really great ice cream! 1st time here, will be back before the summer is finished."}
{"text":"This place has good ice cream but I don't think it is anything super special. I took my daughter here for the first time over the summer only because we went to another ice cream place first and the line there was over an hr wait. L0L. I came here on a Saturday night and it was pretty slow. The cashier was nice and although it didn't hit the spot for me I can't complain it made my daughter happy. She got the cotton candy flavor and it was pretty sweet, for me anyway."}
{"text":"What more could you ask for fresh cookies and ice cream!!!"}
{"text":"This place is DEE-licious!   I absolutely love their ice cream sandwiches. I'm thankful this place isn't near my house or I would be there every other day. My favorite is an ice cream sandwhich with Strawberry Cheesecake Ice Cream and 2 sugar cookies. Yummmo.   The employees are always friendly. If you ask them for samples, they are always happy to provide you with some. My previous employer had them catered once and they did a fantastic job. Great little dessert shop :D ."}
{"text":"#best chocolate chip cookies...plus ice cream is so yummy...a must try for #foodies in #las Vegas"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Love that they have Thrifty ice cream! I used to go to smartys gas station to get Thrifty Ice cream. Its a dump there, so the opening of Sweet Addiction was refreshing & exciting!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! The cookies were baked fresh. The ice cream sandwiches were awesome! I was prepared to pay $6 each but they only cost $3! What a treat!"}
{"text":"The Thrifty ice cream was not that great. The cookies were just ok ! You can just go to the store and buy some dreyers ice cream instead ! The prices were low. But i would pay more for better handmade ice cream !"}
{"text":"After seeing many pictures and check-ins for Sweet Addiction, I was determined to check out this place. When I arrived with my friend their staff immediately greeted us and was very friendly. I order an ice cream cookie sandwich with a chocolate chip cookie and chocolate brownie cookie with vanilla ice cream. It was delicious! It was also very cheap, since they give you 50 cents off your order if you check in on Yelp or Facebook. Overall, I was very pleased with my visit to Sweet Addiction and I can't wait to come back and try their other flavors!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love everything about this place! Always greeted with a smiling employee and of course (my favorite) chocolate brownie with mint chocolate chip ice cream always satisfying my sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"Super yummy & cheap, glad i found this place.  I \"checked in\" on yelp before i went and got .50 off one of my chipwiches (google instructions how to check in on yelp, bring your device with you and check in after you park).  I got one chipwich with brownie cookies and brownie ice cream; other chocolate chip cookies with rocky road, both were phenomenal, absolutely delicious, you can mix and match many cookies and ice creams, both melted in my mouth. I ate them too fast (the first one was too good so the second one was devoured next day) and now have to go back sooner than I thought.  Cookies were very fresh and alot of chips.  You can \"check in\" once a day.  Location is in a nice mall.  I will try a cookie sundae next with another chipwich."}
{"text":"Favorite place.  Always.  Cookies.  Ice cream.  Literally my two favorite things on earth.  Can't go wrong when you sandwich them together."}
{"text":"I like Thrifty ice cream and never knew this place existed until I Yelped it. Very close to the house. Went there ten mins later after finding it and surprisingly it was busy and all the tables were filled; this was around 9:30pm. I enjoy my ice cream in waffle cones but they don't have that (what??). So I opted for the cup and got two scoops: birthday cake and pistachio. Delicious as always. Scoops were about a 1/3 of what I usually get (Centennial Thrifty Durango/215 scoops are HUGE).  Overall experience was mediocre.  Two stars because: 1. No waffle cones. 2. Small scoops. 3. Receipt couldn't be printed and had to be emailed.   I absolutely hate leaving bad reviews but I will adjust the star rating if things improve."}
{"text":"A little pricey and the cookies are hard. I don't really like how the cookies are uncovered and out in the open but the ice cream is good."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for a few months. Finally went with a friend and it was delicious! Portions are a decent size that two can share, but I still finished mine haha, and prices are decent for what you're getting. Can't wait to go back and switch up my order to try something new. So many different options!!!"}
{"text":"It was ono! Only issue I had was she got my ice cream wrong....I asked for the mint chocolate cookie with \"birthday cake\" ice cream but she gave me the mint chip ice cream instead but it was still delish. Will come back when I vacation again."}
{"text":"The Ice cream was very soft/creamy which I like, Everyone was very friendly too. I loved their choices of flavors and I tried 2, to decide what I wanted to order.  I tried the chocolate chip cookie and the mint chocolate chip cookie. Both cookies were fantastic.    My cookie sandwich was $3.50 and I don't think there was enough ice cream on it to justify the price.  I think it's a tad over priced which is the main reason I'm giving 4 stars vs 5.  But it was very yummy and I'd definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place to get something sweet especially in the hot summer! I got a white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookies with vanilla ice cream. I was surprised how big it was and pretty filling. The cookies weren't as soft as I expected it to be. I paid $2.50 for the ice cream sandwich. Usually it would be $3 but if you check in you get a $0.50 off discount."}
{"text":"Who would have ever thought of inventing a cookie sandwich with ice cream in the middle. This place is delicious! We decided to have the white macadamia nut cookie with almond mocha ice cream.. I must say it is damn freaking good! It's too bad they are located on the west side of town but good news Henderson Yelpers! They are planning to open one soon on our side of town.. Now that is dangerous for my diet.. but who cares its worth it, you will be on cloud 9 for 10 minutes, try sweet addiction now for an orgasmic experience in your mouth!"}
{"text":"I find some of the negative reviews on here pretty funny... these ice cream sandwiches are like $3. $3! .... wait... did you miss that... $3. I'm sorry but I have a hard time complaining about tasty treats that only cost $3. Especially when they are homemade from scratch cookies with delicious ice cream. Someone complained about the ice cream selection... umm... they have over 20 something flavors. I don't know where that guy goes for ice cream but I'd say that's pretty damn impressive for such a small little shop. But I get it... everyone has there own opinions... but c'mon... $3! Lot of debate on what an ice cream sandwich should be.... well then open your own ice cream sandwich place. Not all ice cream sandwiches are created equal.  Anyway.. enough about everyone else. I experienced very friendly service, really good cookies (tuxedo) and tasty ice cream (vanilla... yeah i'm boring... so what). Biting into it was a bit difficult and I had to split it in half like an oreo. I don't mind the extra work! All going to the same place.  Until next time...."}
{"text":"I've read a lot of good reviews on this place so when I was going thru my mail last night and came across a buy 1 get 1 coupon, I was on it! With my prince in tow, we made our way to this dainty shop in a complex right across Walmart.   There was a line when we got there (it went by quick) which gave me a little time to peruse their menu. They offer a variety of cookies and thrifty ice cream to satiate your hankering for sweets. They also have discounts in store like $1 off for texting and .50 for checking in.  We sampled some and decided on White chocolate macadamia cookies with strawberry cheesecake ice cream sandwich, and the cult classic Chocolate chip with cookies & cream. Both were really good but I liked the former best. Sandwiches are big enough to share for two, the cookies are perfectly soft on the center and crispy on the edges. We will definitely be back to try more combinations. Oh and the kids that work there are awesome, very engaging, fast and above all service with a huge smile! That alone is worth going back and making loyal customers out of us."}
{"text":"Ok, I REALLY wanted to like this place. The concept and cleanliness/ vibe is totally cool, but I'm there for the ice cream sandwiches after all. Sweet Addiction, I hope you're reading this... I went there with my chef boyfriend and we both were super excited to try their fare. After sitting down and taking our first bite, we both agreed:  Nothing wrong with the cookies. If you catch them fresh, they're a nice combo of chewy and crisp. Sturdy enough to hold up to a melting blob of frozen dairy in the middle, which I can appreciate. I recommended their visibly popular oatmeal-raisin, which seemed to be one of the lowest (if not THE lowest) stack in their cookie shelf.  Our major gripe was the ice cream. Boy was it... icy. I wouldn't call it ice cream but dairy-tinged sorbet. Seriously, it was watered down, not creamy, and just.. not good. I know there's some kind of cult following in random groups about Thrifty's ice cream, but if this stuff is it then... sorry to say, I can't support it! No creaminess whatsoever. It tasted cheap, watery, and we BOTH ended up sadly scraping the \"ice cream\" off and morosely eating the cookies. Like I said, we WERE both primed to enjoy their fare.   I'm from third world Asia and it didn't really bother me, but my boyfriend (the chef, with professional training in commercial food safety and cleanliness) was particularly worried about the cookie shelf, which is in the open air, without any sort of covering over it, high up near the ceiling. Very vulnerable to any flying bugs or whatever else may be floating in the air. Not to mention, prolonged air exposure is a baked good's worst nightmare. Sweet Addiction, we want to like you guys, but we won't be back till the ice cream gets upgraded.  P.S. I bought like FOUR Groupon certificates in anticipation of loving this place and getting a good deal... ended up using ONE certificate and contemplating using the rest for just cookies. We gave one to one of his friends who has a sweet tooth, hope he enjoys it more than we did."}
{"text":"I don't get the whole Thrifty's Ice Cream excitement (I think Thrifty's is a little before my time). But I can recognize delicious things and Sweet Addiction has got them!  At Sweet Addiction, my favorites seem to be the most colorful ones in the case. Like a child, I gravitate toward rainbow colored ice creams? The kid in me thinks they'll taste better I guess. Whatever the reasoning is behind my sub-conscious wanting pink and blue, candy-colored ice cream, I'm in love with the Circus Animal Cookie and Birthday Cake. They have other \"normal\" flavors as well but those are my go-tos. Cookie-wise I'll order whatever floats my boat. I've sampled the chocolate chip and white chocolate macadamia which are both winners. They're soft in the center with a little crisp on the edges--just how I like it! They've got a fridge of beverages with a few different kinds of root beer for.... you guessed it--root beer floats! Tip from the ladies of Sweet Addiction: Don't get too creative with your ice cream choice. Stick with a classic like vanilla because a mint chocolate chip root beer float just sounds nasty.  I rarely eat ice cream. Long story short, I worked at Coldstone and ate too much Birthday Cake Remix. But if I'm taking someone on an ice cream run, Sweet Addiction has that chic, modern, and daresay slightly upscale decor that makes it the cool--but cheap--place to entertain yourself and other people. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm feeling ice cream, this is where I go. The ice cream tastes great and the cookies are just amazing. Try this place if you haven't!!"}
{"text":"For those of us who grew up with Thrifty ice cream, the first bite will be pure nostalgia! Being a California native, I was upset when all stores vanquished. But to my surprise, my new home town is flourishing with stores that serve this premium ice cream. Sweet Addiction is the place to go for a good sugar rush!"}
{"text":"This place is great! For an ice-cream sandwich, their price is reasonable. The ice-cream flavors were great, if anything more selection would be better but it suffice the cravings. I like how they give large scoops and the cookies are delicious. I always bring my 4 y/o nephews  and they enjoy it every time."}
{"text":"Are you in the mood for delicious (Thrifty) ice cream? Are you in the mood for delicious, freshly made assortment of cookies (the ones like subway with the middle still slightly gooey)? Are you ready to smash those two together into a delicious ice cream cookie sandwich?!  Seriously though this place is always clean. Always has friendly service and the ice cream and cookies are sweet af. Whenever I get a craving for ice cream, this is where I go and it always hits the spot. Prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"Bomb-dot-com ice cream cookie sandwiches!! The concept of this store is so unique. There's a variety of cookies (~8 or so) to chose from to make your sandwich and they have a decent selection of ice cream flavors. They have some interesting flavors - like Circus cookie ice cream flavor..it was sweet & tasty.   I ended up with an oatmeal raisin + white chocolate chip cookie with chocolate brownie ice cream sandwich.  De lici ous. This place gets my seal of approval for sure :)"}
{"text":"The best ice cream sandwiches I've ever eaten!!! I have been a regular customer for four years and I always go to sweet addiction to get my sweet tooth fix. My usual is the white chocolate macadamia nut cookie with two scoops of their cotton candy THRIFTY'S ice cream - YUM! Wish they had more locations opening up around vegas."}
{"text":"I had a mint chocolate chip ice cream with brownie cookie. So good. Very delicious and reasonably price. I only wish they had more \"exotic\" flavors such as mango or green tea. But that's the Asian tastebuds talking."}
{"text":"Sweet Addiction has been opened now for about five days and is a cute cookie sandwich shop reminding me of So-Cal's Diddy Reese cookie ice cream sandwich shop. The male owner was very enthusiastic about his product and very eager to serve you. They have 8 different varieties of Thrifty's ice cream and about 10 different choices of freshly baked cookies. Thifty's ice cream is sold in several shops around town and I was very familiar with the taste and varieties that were offered. I just came from dinner so I just ordered a baker's dozen (choosing one of each cookie). While the three of us were sampling each, Half of the cookies seemed undercooked. Upon holding it, it fell apart and tasted raw in the middle. Since they have been open for less than a week, like the owner stated they still have kinks to work out and many things to learn. While my friends and I were looking around w e noticed that a worker in a pink shirt was touching cash, then touching her face, and then touching the cookies and the owner was using his hands to place the cookies on top of the display. Remember with any ready to eat food, you have to wear gloves and once you touch cash or your face, you must always wash your hands! Overall though, with the great customer service and sweet treats, this is a great place to cool down and get your sweet fix!"}
{"text":"If you like ice cream and you like cookies, go here. The sandwiches are amazing. The selection of flavors is daunting, so you will be sure to find something to make your sweet tooth happy. I'm glad it's not closer to my house since I'd be here even more often. The employees are super friendly and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Items selected: Samples = Chocolate Malted Crunch, Mocha Almond Fudge, Medieval Madness, Birthday Cake, Circus Animal Cracker, Pumpkin, Butter Pecan, Pecan Praline Snickerdoodle - Circus Animal Cracker - Oatmeal Butterscotch Chocolate Chip - Pecan Praline - Brownie Cookie  Located on Fort Apache with a second location further Southeast, Sweet Addiction had long been on my list of places to visit and with dessert at Hakkasan not quite enough I finally decided to stop by, the simple concept of fresh-baked cookies and Thrifty ice cream proving an entirely enjoyable pairing of America's two favorite treats.  Small in size with white tile set against pastel paints as top-40 played overhead it was just after 8:30pm that I entered the store's cozy confines and with a few families in line at the counter I took my time to peruse the options, my order coming only after I'd sampled several spoonfuls of \"cult favorite\" signatures - the Chocolate Malted Crunch and Medieval Madness particularly impressive with the later a spot-on match for a 3 Musketeers candy bar while the former harkened Whoppers in taste and texture, both.  Generally fancying a vanilla base to chocolate, particularly when pairing with accoutrements, it was with the mash-up of pink-frosting and Iced Animal Crackers between a warm Snickerdoodle and seasonal Oatmeal butterscotch that my tasting began and with pronounced sweetness found at each turn one couldn't help but feel like a child at heart, the scoop of subtly salted Pecan Praline ice cream a far more nuanced 'adult' flavor that proved a perfect counterpoint to a dense chocolate brownie while pairing marvelously to the buttery notes of a textbook chocolate chip cookie, the edges just crisp while the interior remained chewy and soft.  Perhaps not as 'artisan,' yet far less spendy than the ice cream sandwiches at Monte Carlo's BLVD Creamery or Sprinkles at The Linq, Sweet Addiction is the sort of place both 'foodies' and families can enjoy without breaking the bank, each cookie ringing in at under $1 with discounts on larger orders available as items are baked fresh to replenish supplies throughout the day."}
{"text":"We love this place! Fresh cookies, Thrifty ice cream, $1 off on Tuesdays. You pick the ice cream, you pick the cookies (yes you can mix or match), and have it inside a cup for all around under $3 on Tuesdays.   They have a tip jar either for girls or boys, kind of cute. Yes, we put a couple dollars into the girls jar. There's also a soda fridge there, carrying some not your usual sodas. This place though is a chain only in Nevada, I look forward to coming here again with its friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place has really good ice cream and I like the fact that you can make a cookie ice cream sandwich and use any type of cookies that you want you can mix-and-match. The cookies always seem to be freshly baked and a delicious. The service is also very good as well. I've been there several times and it's always a five-star experience."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! Nice selection of ice cream flavors, not too overwhelming. I love how the cookies are soft! Most places I've been to that do ice cream cookie sandwiches use cookies that are firm, which I think makes it difficult to eat.  As for experience- the shop was rather hot and stuffy which make it uncomfortable to sit and eat inside. Unfortunately outside there was only 1 table with 2 chairs."}
{"text":"Best cotton candy ice cream I've tasted in awhile! The service is very friendly, and the establishment is very clean. Great for groups as well. The price is very good and under $5. I got a sandwich with the cotton candy ice cream. The ice cream selection is small, but is good."}
{"text":"We came on a Thursday evening and used our groupon (4 for 8) to get 2 cookie sundaes.   - Love the name! Creative.  - Cookie sundae =  1 cookie on the bottom with 2 choices of ice cream. Topped with whipped cream and chocolate sauce.  - Ice cream from Thrifty's. Average scoop size. A bit icy. Unique flavors such as circus cookie bits. I'd pay more for cold stone. - Concept has been done before. They have one in HB. Great that it's in LV! - Cookies are chewy. Personally, I think Mrs. Field's is better. Like the chocolate mint cookie.  - Nice decor. Owl paintings. Support small business. Good for a quick fix. 3 cookies for for 1.50. Need more seating."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great ice cream and cookies. Hard to find places, even in the food business anymore, that know how to treat people. Great job!"}
{"text":"This is an ice cream place for the masses!  Kids and adults alike won't be able to pass up these delicious ice cream cookie sandwiches.    My first time here and the server greeted me with a smile and asked if I had ever been there before (I had that \"first-timer\" look on my face, you know?).  She cheerfully explained to me that the sandwich consisted of two cookies - the same or like flavors - and one flavor of ice cream.  She gladly let me sample an ice cream flavor.  And, as I was getting out my phone to check in, she mentioned that I could get 50 cents off my order if I checked in via facebook or yelp.  How nice of her to volunteer that info!  I love a good discount!    I settled on 2 m&m cookies and the tried and true chocolate chip ice cream.  What a delightful ice cream treat!  As I whittled down my ice cream mound I became more and more excited to get to a point where I could easily bite both cookies and ice cream without destroying my sandwich.  It became a bit of a game.  It's OK, you can say it... \"dork.\" lol  A very satisfying treat and reasonably priced.  Score!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little place! I've lived on this side of town for 4 years and I've never ever seen it. Came across it on yelp! Went yesterday for an ice cream sandwich and it was super yum!! Definitely will be going back"}
{"text":"The husband and I have a new years resolution to go on a date, at least once a week, to a place that neither one of us have ever been to.  As the first week of January was nearing an end, we decided we had better get on it and find our place of the week.  We found this cute little place which was right down the street from our house and had shining Yelp reviews.  We pulled up and it was packed, which is a great sign for an ice cream shop in January.  I honestly do know how this concept has never been thought of before. It's so very simple and so very genius: any flavor Thrifty ice cream you fancy, sandwiched between two warm, fresh out-of-the-oven cookies! The best part, the place is CHEAP! Like, crazy cheap! Our one sandwich ran us $3.50.  We had mint chocolate chip with mint chip cookies just to keep it simple for our first time experience. It was a perfect treat and we will be back again. Next time, I'll try to be little more adventurous in my ice cream sandwich concoction making."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hype that this place has is about, but it's just your standard ice cream and cookie place. Pretty okay, but it's nothing that's been done before.  They have Thrifty brand ice cream and their own baked cookies. I had the cotton candy ice cream and macadamia nut cookie. The ice cream was your standard cotton candy-flavored ice cream. The cookie looked alright from the top (but it still looked pretty oily), and then I took a bite and the bottom of it was all burnt! Not a good combo of flavors.  Staff seemed to lack customer service. The place had both indoor and outdoor seating, which both are limited in space.  Eh, at least their prices are good and they have specials each day of the week..."}
{"text":"The ice cream  was exactly that \"thrifty\",  the cookies were okay not any place I would go back to.  The cookies were kind of crispy not really soft.  I was craving ice cream and went here.  It didn't hit the spot and I ordered two of my favorites (black cherry and chocolate mint) too.  I like a place in Westwood ca and the cost is so much less and you get a lot more ice cream.  Well gotta try things atleast once.  For two cookies it was 7.50"}
{"text":"This place is great! Build your own ice cream sandwiches=fantastic.   You go in and pick from 10+ cookies, then you pick your ice cream 15+ different flavors. And they put it together. I think it's fantastic. If you don't like their cookies and \"I've had better\" obviously! Doesn't seem to me that they scratch make their cookies, but they are still good. Ill be back. Not too often because let's be honest they are huge portions.   To all of you who think it was your idea. Really your idea?"}
{"text":"Soft baked cookies that are periodically taken out of the oven, Thrifty's ice cream being scooped into each sandwich, and an onslaught of choices when it comes to creating your own treat are some of the constants you can expect from Sweet Addictions.  The cookies are soft in the center and has a nice crisp around the edge. The ice cream is a staple for the nostalgic Thrifty's fan. I can see why Sweet Addictions is so popular with the residents around them because there isn't another place like it around.   I split a sandwich and felt fine after. Normally, I am pretty greedy when it comes to frozen treats. There was just no push to get another or need to horde the first."}
{"text":"So happy Las Vegas is finally getting more ice cream places. In the desert where it's so hot most of the time, you'd think there'd be one on every corner. I've seen Thrifty ice cream in drug stores around town, but never tried it. It was your average grocery store ice cream. I sampled the Medieval Madness, which was pretty good. But I got the Chocolate Malted Crunch which I've heard so much about. It was okay, I doubt I'd get it again. But I can't wait to try some of their other flavors like Birthday Cake and Circus Cookie. I paired my ice cream with a Tuxedo cookie (white and chocolate chips) and a Snickerdoodle. Their cookies are normal cookie size if you make cookies at home, but they are so good. I loved the Snickerdoodle! You can tell they're fresh, the Tuxedos were fresh out of the oven when I ordered mine, so the chips were melted and gooey. The ice cream melts into them nicely and makes it even better. All this for less than $3 (Be sure to check in on Yelp for a discount on your order.) They even make a Cookie Milkshake, doesn't that sound yummy.  The staff is super nice and patient and will let you try ice cream flavors before you choose.  Looking forward to more visits and sweet treats."}
{"text":"Thrifty's ice cream, and the option to put it between two fresh baked cookies.......need I say more?"}
{"text":"this place is great, the mint chocolate chip cookie is outta this world, i buy a bakers dozen at a time. i highly recoomend you try this place out"}
{"text":"They have great ice cream sandwiches! Their cookies are homemade and you get to choose from a variety of cookies. I had the chocolate chip cookie and cappuccino chip ice cream. It was amazing! They had a buy one, get one for free special on Black Friday."}
{"text":"First tried this place out when my friend got me a cotton candy ice cream with oatmeal cookies. It was sooo good. I loved it!  When I fest went to this place it reminded me of Yogurtland or Menchies. I love the environment that this place has. The little sitting area is very cute.   There was a female worker helping us out and she seemed very irritated because my friends and I wanted to try a couple ice cream flavor samples.   Regardless, I love this place. Can't go wrong with freshly baked cookies and Thrifty's ice cream!"}
{"text":"Two cookies with ice cream, you can choose the cookies, and choose the ice cream.  They put it together and serve it in a cup.  It's good cookies, they're fresh, the ice cream is \"thrifty\" ice cream, but it wasn't way out there like what I've been told, so overall, it's just two cookies with ice cream for about $6, I think I could do that at home!"}
{"text":"Update: Knocked off a star due to overcharging us! We ordered only 4 sandwiches and had the .50 off yelp offer. We were charged almost $20!!!  Crazy.... Had to go back and explain while we had the kids, needless to say it was inconvenient and left the sandwiches not tasting as good....:-/"}
{"text":"What a discovery! Great price for the quality and quantity.   I committed to the cappuccino crunch ice cream sandwiched with the oatmeal butterscotch cookie and the white chocolate macadamia cookie. Both cookies were soft and chewy. The ice cream was chunky and it was just great. The ice cream needed to defrost a bit because it was rock solid.   My friend had the pistachio ice cream sandwiched with the brownie cookie and the tuxedo cookie. I appreciated the chunks of pistachio but I couldn't get over the fact that the ice cream was green - means they used food coloring. Pistachio ice cream is suppose to be white. The brownie cookie was my favorite. Imagine eating just the top of brownies.   I sampled the pumpkin ice cream and I was hoping for a stronger ginger taste but it was more like a pumpkin spice latte.    Great customer service, great cookies, decent ice cream and great prices."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!! Seriously good cookies and great ice cream too! Customer service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like cookies and ice cream? Who doesn't like cookies OR ice cream!? Honestly though, it's amazing. They have half a dozen flavors of cookies, and even more flavors of ice cream. The beauty of this place is you don't have to stick with just one cookie type, you can have a snickerdoodle and a peppermint with cotton candy ice cream.  Try and get the cookies that are fresh out of the oven and still warm, it makes the experience that much better- but be warned, the cookie doesn't stay warm for long, so just devour it. Single cookies are 75 cents each, and you can get just ice cream with chocolate sauce and whipped cream if that's your thing. They serve Thrifty ice cream here. The prices are very low, considering the amount you get. Remember to look on the wall next to the ice cream, there is a list of more flavors they have in the back (coconut pineapple ice cream is listed here, and it is by far the best they have). You have endless options, but be careful, you might not like the concoction of your choice, so don't hold it against them."}
{"text":"Get the animal cookie cookie sandwich!   Try all the flavors too!  So yumma!  :). They have tons of flavors but I was in a rush so I just grabbed this on the go and was so happy!!!! :)"}
{"text":"I swear I was just going to have a bite.....I ended up eating more than my half of the ice cream sandwich goodness.  Home made cookies....about 8 or more different types.  We tried the white chocolate macadamia nut and chocolate chip with walnut....and both were good but I preferred the chocolate chip with walnut since it wasn't quite as sweet.  They serve Thrifty ice cream, which I've been told is the best....you'll have to try it out and judge for yourself.  Overall very simple but creative concept and you can't really beat the price of $3 for two cookies and a scoop of ice cream =)"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about this place at first but boy did they change my opinion when I ordered! I ordered the butterscotch cookie with the praline caramel ice cream. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Met friends there on a Sunday night because it was close to her house.  We occupied one of the tables for more than an hour and the employees didn't seem to care.  We all ordered the Sunday Sundae because that is how you roll on a Sunday.  For me, it ended up being too much!  I wish I had just ordered the ice cream sandwich.  I am sure others will call me crazy.  The cookie was chewy and delicious.  Thrifty type ice cream.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"There isn't much in the world of food that I enjoy more than a good cookie.  Certain buffets I've been to have actually been upped/deducted a star or so based on their freakin cookies.  That may be harsh but that's how much I like them.    Snickerdoodles, oatmeal raisin, peanut butter, sprinkles, anything with chunks of chocolate, you name it and I am down.  Having only to choose 2 cookies to sandwich my ice cream took a while.  But I will be back for many more combinations that is for sure.    I am not familiar with the Thrifty ice cream brand but I am certainly a fan now with all the crazy flavors they have.  I went with the \"Birthday Cake\" which accompanied my snickerdoodle/chocolate macadmia cookies very well.  My wife got the \"Bubble Gum\" flavor and it was love at first sight.  Blue colored ice cream!     So simple, so great, soooo looking forward to my next trip."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here after dinner. We didn't expect to eat, since we were quite full, but the flavors had us. And the option of making an ice cream cookie sandwich with 2 different cookies!! There aren't many ice cream flavors, it isn't that other really popular ice cream place after all, but the ones we tried were delicious and we both ended up going w Cappuccino Crunch, which could be eaten by the bucket full, we determined. The young lady behind the counter was patient and seemed to have a friend just hanging around having ice cream too so seemed to enjoy her job. For us, 2 single scoop sandwiches were under $10."}
{"text":"I love this place. The cookies are amazingly delicious. Fresh baked. The Thrifty ice cream is really good. Cool little place."}
{"text":"Wish I could give a zero star review I was up all night with food poisoning from their ice cream or cookies not sure what gave it to me but I will never be back I'm officially scarred for life with ice cream. I know it was them because I had barely eaten that day"}
{"text":"Wowee!  I finally got to try out the ice cream creations here with my son and a couple of friends and we were happy campers!  First of all, there's a Yelp check-in offer: .50 off--not bad since it's only $3 for one of their delectable frozen delights.  They have cookies that you match up with ice cream to make your own ice cream sandwich.  Snickerdoodles?  Oh yeah, my favorite!  They were out of cherry chip ice cream so I went with chocolate brownie and, voila, heaven in my cup.  We are addicted, and I like that this is a small business making it in the Vegas market--we will be back for our next fix soon!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Stars. Is this place forreal? I've been meaning to try this place for about a month and I finally did and now I must go back! Everyday! Until I try every possible cookie/ice cream combination possible! The idea of an ice cream cookie sandwich sounds so simple yet who knew it could be this amazing? I don't know if they rotate ice cream and cookie flavors per season or what not, because it doesn't seem like there is a giant selection as you would find with many other ice cream places but I guess all the cookie/ice cream sandwich combinations can truly add up. I had the sundae on a snickedoodle cookie (which tasted like Christmas) with a scoop of birthday cake ice cream and a scoop of chocolate malt ice cream topped with whipping cream and chocolate sauce and it was incredibly scrumptious. My mom had the pecan praline ice cream sandwich on a snickerdoodle and gluten free peanut butter cookie and that peanut butter cookie was to die for. We must sneak away here for desert more often and try everything else soon!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me so we tried it out and it was surprisingly good! Went in later in the evening, assumed they'd be closed by 9, but actually not till 11pm. (bonus) Attendant was extremely polite and asked if this was our first visit. She then offered all the info we could want to make a good choice. I ended up with Tuxedo cookies (White and choc chip) with Birthday cake ice cream.  She seemed just as enthused with every other patron she came across which was very refreshing to see expecially being the end of the day.   The only negative thing I can say is that it could've looked a little cleaner in the dining area, tables and paint scraped off the wall from chairs. But I understand this isn't a 5 star restaurant... It might have been nice to have more ice cream flavors. Not many options without something nutty or minty, which I'm not a fan of. Other than that, it was all good! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great cookies, good ice cream. Great prices.  Reason for only 3 stars: They always seem to have only one poor young employee working and at the heaviest part of the night. I ordered a dozen cookies at 8:00 and 30 minutes later they weren't even put in the oven yet because the only person working was slammed. It was Thursday night ffs get another employee!  The line gets awful, the cookies run out, and the customers are loud and obnoxiously crammed inside a tiny, tiny building. You can't just sit and enjoy a dessert without listening to babies screaming, having people standing all around you and teenagers being... well... teenagers."}
{"text":"Thrifty's ice cream sandwiched between two delicious cookies?! My diabetic dreams have come true. I always get the chocolate malt flavor in between two chocolate chip cookies. Usually I take it to go with the cookies in a separate bag. They taste much better heated up and then placed onto the ice cream!  However, visiting here frequently can cost money, so I've sometimes bought Thrifty ice cream (from somewhere else) and baked my own chocolate chip cookies. But for the days I'm lazy and only want to eat one, I come here (:  That check-in offer is pretty sweet too."}
{"text":"Fresh Baked Homemade delicious - Cookies. The kind that could potentially outperform your own Mother's Secret recipe. Sweet Addictions staff is uber happy and friendly the place is immaculately clean and fun Filled - May need more Tables and Chairs but they deliver the goods Insane Thrifty Ice Cream and amazing cookies, Mix and Match your favorite and create an Ice Cream Sandwich - Can't wait fr a Green Valley Opening (Hint hint..)"}
{"text":"Full of sugar and I didn't like the taste so much (I tried the ice cream ONLY). I had high expectations because of all the reviews, but unfortunately I won't come back :/  I think that also the presentation is cheap and looks bad (looks like sams club foam small plates - never seen such a bad presentation).  Also the service was subpar , it felt like the lady just wanted to close the shop and go home (I did came to their place about half an hour before closing, but still ...)."}
{"text":"Loved it! Thrifty ice cream (throwback to my childhood) and a homemade cookie of my choice to complete my very own custom ice cream sandwich... Brilliant idea! I will be back :)"}
{"text":"I am a former employee so I may be a little bias about Sweet Addiction lol. Although even before I worked here I was obsessed. I came here all the time to get ice cream sandwiches. Even after working here I still have nothing but good things to say. I will always support small businesses over a chain. The owners were incredible people and the best bosses. Although I heard they are under new management now. Nonetheless I have visited recently and everything looks the same, beside a new peanut butter cup cookie and now green tea ice cream! This business really strived for good customer service and keeping the establishment clean. I love coming here, I'm still a hard core fan of thrifty's ice cream. My favorite combos were sugar cookie and cotton candy and snicker or brownie cookie with strawberry cheesecake!"}
{"text":"I never knew this place was so close to my house! And BOY am I glad~ Fresh ice cream, kind and friendly service, and reasonable prices! What more to ask for? I had the \"Take Me to the Circus\" dessert, and I think it's the prettiest, most tasty dessert I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"So i went in checked it out and had to go back after i figured out what i would want..so many choices. Finally choosing an ice cream sandwich with one white chocolate macadamia nut cookie and just white chocolate on the other smashed with pecan praline- THRIFTY ice cream for those who knows the importance of that!! YUMMY i have to save some for later. Will be going back to try more combinations and to get pints of ice cream :-)"}
{"text":"I'll definitely need to try it out more. I went with a few friends and it was our first time (for all of us). We all tried different flavors.  We all tried the Authentic Addict Cookie Sandwich (as you all know, with the $.50 check in, it'll be $2.70 total). That's a good deal. The price was better than we anticipated.  There are many cookie flavors that you pick (you can pick more than one cookie flavor) with your ice cream sandwich. I got the mint chocolate ice cream with the chocolate brownie cookie. Pretty good -- the cookie got softer eventually.  There are a few other things that I wanna try on my next visits so I'll be sure to update with that.  For your first time, it's safe to go with the basic ice cream sandwich and play around with the flavors :).   The place inside looks REALLY nice and clean. It's a good vibe to hang out at with your friends. And they're friendly :)."}
{"text":"The cookie I had was tasty and not unreasonably priced, but they should go over some customer service basics with their employees--when I came in nobody was out front; after a minute or two the worker came out and took my order, but when I went to order more she had again disappeared to the back; I wanted a minute but ended up leaving. So they lose a star for that. But the desserts themselves seem to be pretty good."}
{"text":"The concept of this place is super cool. It beats the standard ice cream parlor by offering fresh baked cookies to make your own personal ice cream sandwich. Granted it is kind of difficult to enjoy it in the same way you would a store-bought treat. The cookies are so large and ice cream is so creamy that it tends to slide everywhere. It's best to just eat it in a cup the way they assemble it for you. I would take this ice cream over those pre-made and stale boxed versions from the store any day!    As soon as you open the door, the wonderful smell of fresh baked cookies wafts through the air and gets your olfactory nerves going. There's enough cookies and ice cream flavors to make literally hundreds of combinations. The cookies are so large I don't think I've ever finished a whole order.   P.S.- There are coupons in the zip code coupon book and ValPak. Buy one get one deals make the trip and calories worth it."}
{"text":"AKWARD. Really disappointed by the service. We were ignored, skipped, helped, ignored, skipped, and then the people before us were about to be rung up and we had to interupt them to remind them they were ignoring us again because we'd be sitting at cash for 5 minutes while they worked to help their friends. There was one guest ahead of us and one behind, and all of this took 1/2 hour. WHAT?? We weren't acknowledged when we entered the store but the people after us were- all three employees were catching up with them because they were obviously friends. It was REALLY bad. . . so embarrassing. The cookie sandwich was great but our guest experience was really a bummer."}
{"text":"Amazing cookie sandwiches  so many flavors to choose from and tons of ice cream flavors. It's a small hidden Jem"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my husband five minutes before close. The cashier was still super friendly. Ice cream was to die for and the cookies were moist and delicious.   It is a 40 minute drive from our house, but we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place... It's fun, different and local;) but as time goes by I feel the prices for cookies have gone up a bit much since they opened. 3 cookies for $2.70/ $9 for a dozen...And the cookies seem to be getting smaller and never consistent in sizes. But overall ice cream n cookies = Smiles;)"}
{"text":"I give this place 1 star due to cheapness & lack of respect for people spending $ in their establishment. They've been open over a year making money hand over fist & still give ghetto packaging in styrofoam containers with foil over the top. This is not acceptable the frozen ice cream sticks to the styrofoam & makes it impossible to scoop out . The styrofoam crumbles when frozen and cracks thus leaving styrofoam in ice cream. Look at the pictures of both mine and my husbands ice cream. Save your money & go somewhere that respects people enough to provide actual cups and lids to their customers."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of ice cream and cookies! Their salted caramel ice cream for their sandwiches is delicious and goes well with any of their cookies. All of the cookies are soft and have easily been a 5/5. Perfect dessert spot!"}
{"text":"Came back here to give it a second shot. We got one animal cookie ice cream with brownie cookie sandwich. Yummy.  Also got the chocolate malt crunch cuz this used to be my go-to thrifty's ice cream when rite aid sold them. I also tried 4 different cookies.   Oatmeal was good, and the rest were okay. I want to say that it's not the best ice cream or cookies I've ever had in my life, but good enough to curb your sweet tooth if in dire need of dessert.   Service was awesome. I hope they clean the chairs more because it's either permanently stained in brown, or dirt infested from some child stomping with their muddy shoes. I didn't bother to try the finger wipe test because I was too scared to find out."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Super delicious and fantastic locally owned business.  Ordered a bday cookie cake last month and I was the talk of the town after others tried it. We visit often and every time is an affordable delicious treat for all; our group consists of ages 3, 12 & adult."}
{"text":"Free samples, great ice cream!  My personal favorites are the black cherry ice cream and birthday cake.  Also, I can't seem to get away from the brownie cookie.  Definitely worth a stop in, especially for the price :)"}
{"text":"Yummy! Was perfect for when I was craving ice cream! Me and my bf assumed it would be small bowls for $6 but we were mistaken!!! Glad we stopped here while shopping and will be back soon! I couldn't finish mine and it filled me up!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the 5 stars are about.  Went here based on Yelp reviews, which I must say I was disappointed in.  The service was excellent.  The young lady that helped us was very friendly, offered samples and explained the menu.  The ice cream is not homemade.  It is Thrifty brand.  They have at least 20 flavor options.  The samples I tried had a freezer burn aftertaste.  I ended up with the grasshopper sundae, which on Sunday's is only $3.50.  They run a daily special and Sunday's special happened to be $2 off any sundae.  The sundae consisted of 2 huge scoops of mint chocolate chip, a small brownie cookie, a drizzle of chocolate sauce, a huge healing of whipped cream and a few chocolate shavings.  It was ok, but definitely didn't set my taste buds on fire. I tried an M&M cookie and while it was ok, the overall impression it left was just that \"ok\".  The store itself seemed outdated and in need of a good cleaning.  I think I will move on and try another Vegas option next time I have a hankering for some scream, ice cream that is!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty basic when it comes to ice cream. And a chocolate chip/snickerdoodle cookie vanilla ice cream sandwich is all it takes to make my tummy happy! Their ice cream is thrifty's. Who doesn't love thrifty's?! Their cookies are nice and chewy, and definitely not hard as a rock. Every time I come here I get good service. Have to get a water bottle while you're at it, they don't call it SWEET addiction for nothing. Definitely wish they had punch cards here. Always a favorite place to stop by in the Vegas heat!  Edited: There was hair in my ice cream sandwich for my latest visit. I lost my appetite and was disgusted."}
{"text":"Decadent and wonderful!!  How much better can it get?  Home made cookies with great ice cream.  I just want more!!"}
{"text":"We went there Monday night and were very happy with the service and the food! Marissa and another woman got our orders out quickly (for 10 people) and we all enjoyed our creations. Locally owned. We will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I was pretty sad when Waffles closed down. Months later, I saw the signs for this place and was curious to see what they had to offer.   My husband and I came here with the family one day after eating dinner at Hot and Juicy Crawfish. I believe at the time they had only been open for about a week. The staff was very friendly. They explained that they specialized in ice cream sandwiches and offered us samples to any flavor of Thrifty's ice cream. We all ordered a ice cream sandwich and enjoyed our desserts! Who would have thought that such a simple idea would taste so good! Hot, fresh, homemade baked cookies + tasty and creamy ice cream = awesome! and for $3 each, you can't beat that. I also like how the chips in the mint chocolate chip and chocolate chip ice cream are thinly shaved, in comparison to the thicker chunks that are found in most other brands.  Its funny, we lived in California for about 5 years and have never heard of Thrifty's ice cream. After reading up on it, I discovered that they were selling it at Rite Aid. LOL, that explains everything, I think I went to a Rite Aid location maybe once.  We have been here a few times now. Our usual plan on our weekends is to eat dinner somewhere and then drive to Sweet Addiction for dessert! If you think about it, you may have to spend $10+ to share one dessert at a restaurant. Here, my husband and I can both get something and spend less!   Happy Tummy Approved! :)"}
{"text":"Weekends are when I look forward to browsing through my Groupons and trying new places.   After a filling meal at 808 sushi, it was time for a sweet. We decided on Sweet Addiction since we were in the area. The shop is pretty cute. It resembles pretty much any yogurt shop around town. They have a variety of options. Cookie and ice cream sandwiches, cookie sundaes, or you can choose cookies or ice cream separately. My fella and I opted for the cookie sundaes since we wanted to maximize our Groupon. I chose a tuxedo cookie and combined it with the black cherry ice cream. My fella chose the macademia nut and white chocolate cookie with banana ice cream. The best part about this place is the Thrifty brand ice cream. I grew up on it, but I'm really not going to drive out of my way for it. The cookies were my least favorite part of the dessert but are definitely made better by the ice cream.  Not the most inventive concept, but the end result is pretty tasty, although they could definitely work on a better cookie recipe . I don't think I'll make this spot a regular stop on my dessert rotation, but it's a good option in the area."}
{"text":"Seriously! Who doesn't love Thrifty's!!  Cute little ice cream shop, showed up 5 minutes after they were closed and putting things away and they still scooped up 2 pints for me! Mmm chocolate malted crunch!!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times; overall it's okay.  The cookies tend to be hard in the cookie sandwich since they're surrounding cold ice cream. I tend to just order a scoop of ice cream now with one cookie. The ice cream is Thrifty ice cream, which is cheap and OK. I don't tend to crave Sweet Addiction, but if I'm in the area and want ice cream and cookies, I'll stop by."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this out until I found out that they used Thrifty ice cream. Yeah, that average ice cream you get from the gas station. The only thing that really sets them apart is their \"homemade\" cookies which was not something I would honestly remember.   At least I can say that I finally tried Sweet Addiction, but unfortunately, I would not come back. There's no place to really sit comfortably and enjoy your ice cream either because the whole setting makes you feel like you should leave once you get your treat.   Also, when I got a sundae, it was served in a regular styrofoam bowl. C'mon guys. Try a little. I seriously feel like I could've made my own sundae and made it better at that rate. Not a fan overall.   Try gelato intead!"}
