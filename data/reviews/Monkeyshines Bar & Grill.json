{"text":"Stopped at ms during a badger game.   The staff was attentive and the beer selection was pretty good.  The interior was plain and the place had zero energy.   I cannot say it was bad, just not a place i want to revisit."}
{"text":"Wow!  Amazing Panko breaded cod.  Cole slaw and fries with a teaser cheddar bay biscuit.  Having been here before things are changing in the food and entertainment department.  All for the better.   Lent is a great time to try some great fish.  I promise you a new and improved experience.   If you love MARCH MADNESS you will be in for one very pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty standard bar food. The service was not good. Our waitress never came to check on us after we got our food. We had to come up to the bar for boxes. The cheese curds were good and cheap. It was the best thing we had."}
{"text":"Monkeyshines is a hard bar to rate because it has a lot of positives -- although most are only slightly positive.  I haven't tried mixed drinks at 'shines.  The beer selection here is below average for Madison.  Otherwise, the beer is fine and the prices fair.  Especially if you order a domestic.  If you are a shooter, the pool tables often have good or even excellent players.  Few of them use bar cues.  Monday nights are league.  Wednesday nights, they have loud karaoke.  Most clients are smokers, and they have an attached smoking room.  That's great for smokers in winter, but it also brings a strong scent of smoke into the main bar.  I go here when friends invite me - a lot of my friends like 'shines - and it's usually crowded, especially as the night goes on.  Women here tend to be a little more aggressive than other bars in my experience, but, hey, if you can complain about that then you can complain about anything."}
{"text":"Check this place out for an inexpensive lunch. Prices are good and portions are large. I especially enjoy their pork chops, mashed potatoes, green beans lunch special. It is served with a large slice of bread.  Wait staff is friendly and food shows up quickly after ordering. The Taco salad is also a good choice.   Haven't been there in the evenings so I can't comment on drinks or the crowd atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  They have outdoor volleyball nets which I always see driving around and it really looks like a fun place.  Indoors has pool tables, arcade games, and TV sets.  The atmosphere is nice for a bar and the place just seems very friendly.  Onto the food and drink... *sighs*  Underwhelming.  I had a bloody mary, my drink of choice.  It was made to my specifications (kudos! because I'm fussy and have to have things done my way exactly!) but tasted slightly below average.  My guess is that they use cheap ingredients.  My companion had a gin and cola and there were no complaints there.  I ordered a chef salad.  There's a reason that it's only five dollars and change.  There's almost no protein.  I will admit that it was a very fresh and tasty salad but I've had side salads with more substance and character.  You get about 1/2 oz. of shredded cheddar and maybe 1 oz. of mystery-meat bits.  Nothing else besides iceberg lettuce, tomato, and onion.  NOT A MEAL!  Chef salads are supposed to have hefty amounts of recognizable protein.  They do have two low-fat dressings which is nice.  Most places have only one if you're lucky.  The salad came with a huge piece of buttered bread but nothing else.  My companion ordered a burger deluxe and chili.  He said the burger was dry and lacking in flavor.  Chili wasn't that great either.  'Edible' is how he described it.  You don't get any sides with whatever you order.  Everything is a la carte and very spartan.  Most places make up for a lack of substance with plenty of filler food like fries or chips.  The prices are extremely low but you're not getting what you're not paying for.  Service...  Every interaction I had with the waitress/bartender was good.  She was knowledgable of the menu and answered my questions easily.  The only problem was that, after our food arrived, she didn't stop by once until after my companion went to the bar to ask for a glass of water.  His glass had been empty for far too long.  We went at noon.  It wasn't horribly busy but it wasn't empty either.  I would have had a much better impression of the service if that friendliness had been seen more frequently at my table.    Note: Now that WI is smoke-free, they have a completely separate smoking room.  You can smell hints of cigarette aroma but there is no smoke in the main bar.  Overall: Not bad but underwhelming in just about everything.  It's not a place to be avoided but I don't see making special plans to go there."}
{"text":"Do not plan on getting any service at this establishment unless you are sitting right at the bar.  Went here once and grabbed a table with some co-workers and we had to all individually approach the bar for drinks and food after not being acknowledged after 35 minutes.  I thought I maybe just caught it on a bad day.  I was wrong.  I went back there with a friend a month later, same story.  Had to approach the bar to order a water, drinks, dinner AND to pay.  Disappointing service with even worse, rude bartenders.  Will not be returning and would advise everyone else to do the same."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast and, as always, very pleased with the food. French toast is my favorite. When the cook makes his own bacon, get there early."}
{"text":"Horrible service, condescending attitude. Don't go here if you want to enjoy yourself. Nasty people."}
{"text":"Good dive bar. Busier in the summer when the volleyball court is open. Wednesday karaoke night is popular too. Food is decent for a dive bar. Only bar I know of that has a smoking room. It's pretty disgusting if you're a non-smoker. Just walking through the room will stink up your clothes."}
{"text":"An odd bar. Sat at a table with 4 friends and we were largely ignored despite it being pretty empty. Average drinks, below-average food, and weird atmosphere. Had an odd beach volleyball court outside that was pretty unkempt. We played volleyball for a while without anyone checking if we wanted a drink (well over an hour) and then just left. Spent over two hours there and only ordered  one drink, would've ordered more if they had waitstaff checking on us."}
{"text":"Pretty enjoyable place. The bartender was a cool dude, asked me about my Blink182 t-shirt and we became buds. The patrons seemed to be a mix of rude peeps and pretty fun peeps. Qualifier: I only people-watched like 25 or so patrons over the course of the evening - wasn't toooo busy in there on Sunday at 8pm)  BAE order the loaded tater tots - They come with cheese, bacon bits, I believe, ranch dressing, and maybe some other goodies? They made her smile, so I approve.  I got a grilled chicken sandwhich on toasted rye, sub seasoned fries for the chips, add an extra chicken breast on the side! Yum. ---Breakdown--- Rye Bread - 5/5 - The best bread I've tasted, toasted up and buttered just a bit. Loved it Seasoned Fries - 4.5/5 - Pretty darn good, wouldn't have asked for anything to be changed! Chicken breasts - 4/5 - Grilled PERFECTLY, but unseasoned. Coiuld have used some cajun seasoning, lemon, etc. Sandwich Veggies 2/5 - Token lettuce, onion, and tomato. Not bad, didn't add much to the meal though  Pretty good dinner. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Clientele is shady. It's a really, really weird mix of people...good people watching, but don't look too long!  I guess I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's consistent with this part of town. All I could think when I walked in was, \"Huh?\"   The bartenders are friendly. The drinks are cheap. I'm not sure if they serve food. Even if they did, I'm not sure what it would be or if I would try it.   It's a little crazy when you walk in. Use you're imagination friends.... It looks like it used to be a strip club and there are volleyball courts outside. I really don't get it. I'm sitting here writing this right now!...and I don't get it. One part pool hall...one part casino...one part strip club= worst shot you've ever had. Expect a hangover!  But, hey, why not give it a shot?!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast food.  Absolutely the best eggs benedict in the area hands d I wn.  Only problem is they only do it the first weekend of the month.  Very friendly staff and great prices!!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on Sunday and had the French toast and it was fantastic..  Great service and the food is fantastic!  My friend had the Mexican omelette and said that was fantastic also."}
{"text":"Monkeyshines is small because of a big, u-shaped bar and a large pool table.  This isn't a problem until it's crowded, which it usually is.  Add in 99% of the patrons smoking, and you've got an asthma attack coming.  Gack!    Really, though, I've generally had an alright time there, so I don't have a vendetta against it.  I would never choose to go here, but I'll go if others are going."}
{"text":"Kind of an odd place, I get the feeling that they have a large group of regulars here. We sat outside and had a couple drinks because it was close to our hotel.  The drinks were pretty watery and the snacks we had were frozen then deep fried and not very good. The service was good and the bartender was friendly but I would not go here again because the clientele made me uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out. Sat at the bar and was flat out ignored by both bartenders even though it was pretty slow. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Really good greasy spoon breakfast on the weekends. Good prices. Nothing fancy, but sometimes that is just what you need on a weekend when you may be recovering from the night before."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a burger at the recommendation of one of my best friends, and a person I generally agree with on food. Have to say the Shines Burger was excellent. Perfectly cooked, great flavor, good bun. If I could name one complaint it was too saucy, but the sauce was great. Served with a pickle and chips by default, I have to say the price was certainly reasonable and both the pickle, which had a garlicy flavor which I liked, and the chips which were home made and seasoned well were great. Food came up quickly, which I appreciated since I was in a rush. Since I went for lunch I didn't have any cocktails or a beer but it appears they have a solid selection of beverages, maybe not any wines but that wouldn't be surprising for this type of place. Good selection of people there when I was, with an older retired group, a couple of working class guys across from me at the bar and a group of mid 20s guys hanging out having a few sitting at a table behind me. Seemed like everyone was well served and happy to be there.  One thing I noticed, there was a definite smell of stale cigarette smoke. Based on other reviews it seems like they have or used to have a smoking room connected. Didn't bother me much, but it might bother some."}
{"text":"The breakfast specials here are fantastic! They change every week. In particular the chef smokes (in house) massive slabs of bacon you will be drooling over. That's only once a month though so maybe call ahead to see what the cook is doing this week. Their eggs Benedict is phenomenal too. I never miss that weekend. In short, come in for the obnoxiously delicious breakfast special and stay for the bloody Mary's and fun staff."}
{"text":"Sub par service and not the most inviting crowd. Let's just say the beers are 3 bucks and they aren't worth the money...."}
{"text":"Random stop for breakfast. Bloody bar was nice but some of the relish tasted less than fresh. Good service and good food. Fairly priced."}
{"text":"Monkey Shines is a smaller bar located off of PD in Fitchburg.  They have two nice pool tables and offer a indoor smoking room for people that want to smoke.  Beer Selection is pretty good and the staff is usually great.  Great Place to stop by for a quick drink."}
{"text":"Super amazing French toast and hella service! Bravo monkey shines! :)  Ps my friend met her husband here."}
{"text":"Michele and patrick were my bar tenders. They were helpful with giving us out of towners directions. And their mojitos were awsome. Burgers not to shabby either. Good time all around."}
{"text":"Service there sucks, it used to be a fun place but has really gone down hill.  I will not be returning"}
{"text":"Not too busy on a Saturday late-morning for breakfast and football. Breakfast portions are inexpensive and large. My farmer's omelet had a sufficient amount of toppings, but was just ok. Friends had the bacon and said it was cooked very well.   The bloody mary was ok. Free jello shots when the Badgers score a touch down! Plenty of space for large parties. An ok place for a cheap breakfast, but don't expect it to be quick. The service was slow and shotty at best."}
{"text":"Not sure what the negative reviewers are talking about..The bartendrrs greet everyone that comes in as a friend...Paige, Courtney and all the others know you by name and will make u laugh even when ur day is hard and not worth always smiling about..The food is always exceptinally good and always served with their friendly BS which takes talent to do everyday..The breakfast is awesome and only made better by the people who serve it .."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast for a very reasonable price. The staff is friendly and we enjoy going there every weekend for breakfast. The French toast is amazing. Great specials every weekend too."}
