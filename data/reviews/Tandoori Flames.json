{"text":"Very nice small quiet Indian restaurant. The food is simply awesome. It is quite affordable than many other places in Calgary. The quantity for take away is also great. Should definitely try the Biryani."}
{"text":"A new star in NW Calgary! My wife and came to Tandoori Flames based on a recommendation from a friend and we were NOT disappointed!!  We started with Veggie Pakoras which had a great crunch in the outside and soft pillowiness on the inside. Very generous veggie to dough ratio.   Next was the Fish Mahi Tikka. Man this is a treasure from their tandoor. The charring and creaminess blended beautifully together. What a treat!  Then we settled in to the Chicken Korma, Dal Tadka, Coconut Pulao and Butter Naan. All were exceptional.   We also enjoyed talking with the owners who were very hospitable. The restaurant is small, clean and neat. Definitely on our list for coming back. I hope a lot of you see this and give them a shot...  Five stars!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! The best butter chicken and naan bread i have ever had in my life. Seriously LOVE IT!!! Really good gulab jamin (sp?) as well, and their okra dish is so yummy too!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. Asked for food for two, got food for four. Butter Chicken was bland, chicken itself was dry. Was really looking forward to this place based on other reviews, but was disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here as I was looking for some good Indian food in the west end as I live out of town. We started with the kabob sampler which was not even on the menu but was mentioned by the owner. Chicken khorma with naan bread and rice was next. This was the best chicken khorma I have ever eaten. I was also impressed as when we asked whether we should order two dishes or one after the appetizer, the owner said that there would be lots with just one. He was right as there was leftovers enough for two small meals.  Great service and with a very friendly couple running it. It is small with seating for only about 20 but does a lot of takeout to the area. It's open in the evenings only as the area is not really suitable for a economical brunch business. The only downsides are that with it's smaller size, I imagine it will be cool in the winter if the door is opening a lot with people coming in and that there is a TV (but it was quiet and I didn't get bothered at all by it).  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Haven't tried them yet for dine-in (they were a takeout-only place when I stopped by), but the vegetarian dishes I chose--samosas, pakoras, chickpeas, lentils, bhasmati rice, naan--were spicy, flavourful delights. The place is tiny and is right on 16th Ave NW just before Home Road if you're going West."}
{"text":"Ran across this place on a business trip and was drawn in by their roadsign dinner special. $30 for two. Had generous portions of vegetable pakoras, an eggplant vegetable dish, their chicken tikki marsala, garlic naan, saffron rice, and a light cheese dessert. A great deal and value for the amount of food, service hospitality, and simple ambience. My wife and I search out Indian food in the cities of our feequent business trips in N. America, and this tops the fine dining ones by a mile."}
