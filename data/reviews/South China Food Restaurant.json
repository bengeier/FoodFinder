{"text":"Terrible; probably the worst Chinese food I have ordered in recent memory.  I ordered orange beef, general tao chicken and sweet and sour ( see pic of each)...they all were way too battered and frankly all tasted the same.  Heavy friend and very average flavour.  I would take manchoo wok all day over this food.  Also ordered the app platter..consensus from the other family that ate the food that it was all awful."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 starts for taste in food, I would.  This is by far, THE worst food, I have ever tasted in a very long time within the GTA.  I should have known better than I saw that the menu had Thai, \"Chinese\", Japanese, etc. food.    I took a taste of everyone's food that day and everyone's food was essentially tasteless.  I would definitely avoid going there at all costs unless you're absolutely drunk and you really don't care because everything tastes good at that point."}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall in a strip mall that has The Friendly Greek and Country Style.  Replaced another Chinese food place years ago and we started coming here under the new banner after our other place in RH changed management for the nth time and quality and policies nose dived.  Staff is very friendly and only a couple of tables and chairs.  Not conducive to sit down and eat but I have seen some do it.  10% cash discount minimum but also they include free house rice over $35 at the time of this review (they accept CC). NOTE: Yelp has this place slotted as a restaurant.  It is a take out establishment.  You won't be bringing your family here to eat.  What really makes this place unique is the Thai + Chinese menu.  The Thai selection (not just satay stuff) includes menu items you would see at a Thai location - including Basil dishes etc.  The result is that you can get the best of both worlds at any given time -- and they do a very good job.  We have been to places like Bangkok Garden and for a small place like this - their flavors are spot on.  Overall the food is generally quite fresh and tasty and their estimated preparation time for pickup is good.  They also adapt easily per your wishes (sauce on side; no chillies etc).  The only negative is the value.  For the money we are paying we are not getting as much food as a number of other Chinese take outs in this price range.  In the past we normally were easily able to stretch the food to two days and maybe even a lunch.  At this location more like 1.5 dinners and no lunch.    Not sure if some of that is attributed to the containers - they use rather \"high end\" plastic containers and lids v. the traditional paper boxes and tin foil pans.  To me akin to a hammer v. fly swatter to hit that fly.  I don't see the reason for the added cost and gut says this alone is helping toward the reduction in value.  Hopefully I am wrong and the costs are more attributable to the maintained freshness.  We are repeat customers and typically hit this place every 3 - 4+ weeks.  The value angle does tend to stretch this out a bit, but the freshness keeps us coming back.    I will aim to update their store front picture."}
{"text":"We order from South China often and when we do, we always order the seafood tom yum soup with noodles. It's a spicy staple of goodness! We also love the green curry chicken! When you order over $35 (before tax) you also get the free house special fried rice. You do need to ask for it. We love South China when we need our fix for Asian comfort food."}
