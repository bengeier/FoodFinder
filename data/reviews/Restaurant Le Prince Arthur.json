{"text":"I love this restaurant. The lunch menu is not expensive and really good. Service is excellent, nice waiters.  The stake Prince Arthur is delicious! Lunch special comes with an entrance and a dessert.  They have nice terrace. If the weather is nice, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I decided to try my limited French and ordered the Cajun Salmon.  The waitress was nice to accommodate me and spoke slowly.  I was able to follow along until she asked something about which salmon I wanted.  She asked if I wanted the salmon from the Menu de Soir.  I said no and pointed to the cajun salmon.   When the salmon came out I could not see any cajun seasoning, so I'm fairly certain they gave me the salmon from the Menu de Soir and not the cajun salmon from the main menu.   The salmon came with garlic and lemon butter, roasted potatoes, and vegetables.  I can't really rate this place higher than 3 stars since they didn't give me the dish I ordered."}
{"text":"Friends and I were wandering the stretch of St. Laurent near Prince Arthur and couldn't decide on what to eat. Yelp indicated a bunch of restaurants on tiny Prince Arthur St so we made our way down. After what seemed like an eternity we settled on Le Prince Arthur (restaurant indecision when you're hungry apparently bends space-time and affects general relativity).  Once seated we were told that this was a BYOB place so as soon as we had ordered I stepped across the street to the local dep to get some cheap wine for dinner.  I ordered the filet mignon with \"giant\" shrimp from their Table d'HÃ´te menu. The filet was cooked a little under medium, which was ok but I really wanted it medium. It was also not a round filet as you would expect. It was more like a fine cut of steak.  The \"giant\" shrimp were more like small prawns or slightly-larger-than-average shrimp. In any case, they were served with melted butter sauce, which I used to give them a little bath before I ate them. My friend ordered the rib steak with scampi, which looked identical to what I ordered. I couldn't tell the difference between his plate and mine even down to the sides and presentation.  The service was quick and efficient. They even came to tell us that since there was a party of 100 people upstairs, they would rush our order through before theirs so that we wouldn't have to wait an hour for our food. I appreciated that.  So the food was good. I was able to bring my own wine from across the street and we were served pretty quickly but there just wasn't much of anything special about the place to get more than 3 stars."}
