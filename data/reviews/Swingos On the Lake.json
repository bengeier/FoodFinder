{"text":"The first time my husband and I went to Swingos, we had a very positive experience.  So, this past December 13 we decided to treat my elderly parents to dinner.  Being that they are used to eating early, we made an early reservation.  Therefore, we were one of the first patrons to walk in the door.  We were excited to show my parents the terrific view of Cleveland and were disappointed to be seated with a view of the parking lot in the area of the wait station.  We were told this was due to a Christmas party.  Our appetizer and wine were served promptly.  After that we were forgotton about, so we flagged down someone to take our order.  Our salads were brought to the table with no bread.  My husband then got up to find someone to bring us bread.  We then finished our salads and continued to wait for our entrees.  We had now been there for nearly two hours when a server came to our table to inform us that they were out of the scampies that my husband and I ordered.  We were a bit confused, being that we were pretty much the first to be seated for the evening.  Apparantly, they were served to the Christmas party.  My husband and I ordered appetizers for our dinner.  While waiting, we were never approached to see if we may need anything such as drinks, etc., so I just went to the bar to get it myself.  At the end of the evening (3 hours later) we were presented with the bill, which they did comp. our appetizers, although the server did proceed to enter into an explanation about being short-handed which seemed to be quite unprofessional.  I normally would never post a negative review on a website, but my reason for doing so is that I e-mailed the restaurant and explained our experience in a polite way and expressed our disappointment.  After waiting about six weeks, with no response or acknowledgement, I printed the e-mail and mailed it to them with a short note; still no response--talk about feeling like a second class citizen!  I'm not asking for anything more than maybe an apology.  Therefore we will no longer dine at Swingos on the Lake.  And for that matter, we will also no longer go to Swingos Grand Tavern.  We tend to dine out quite often, so friends frequently ask for our recommendations (which will not include Swingos).  We'll give Pier W a try for a great view of Cleveland in the future.  FYI Swingos:  Next time you have a large party reserved, please let your patrons know upfront at the time they are making their reservation."}
{"text":"I went there a while ago on a date with my girlfriend, in part because I had a coupon.  

The decor is a bit old-school, you can easily imagine some crooners hanging out there, definitely not modern.  They have a fantastic view of the lake however.

The service was good; knowledgeable and prompt.  We shared the shrimp marionga which are fantastic.  I believe we both had caesar salads which were decent.  I ate the Mountain Brook Trout for dinner and it was quite good as well.

Swingos has a 15 pound, leather-bound book for their wine list.  They do offer some fantastic vintages but they are strongly geared to the expensive.  We really only used it to find out how much their most expensive bottle is.  The restaurant is expensive but they could benefit from more wine at lower price points.

I'd likely go there again, with a coupon."}
