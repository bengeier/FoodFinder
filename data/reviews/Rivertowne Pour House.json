{"text":"Rivertowne Pourhouse is certainly a favorite bar/restaurant of mine. When Rivertowne Pourhouse (formerly Parkway Tavern for you townies) opened a few years ago, it already had a large following of former Gateway students grandfathered in.  So let me start with the good about this place. [Pretty much] everything. A lot of employees have been friends of mine, the food is always incredibly delicious, the drinks are served promptly. I mention the employee point to illustrate that this is truly a local establishment which emphasizes a \"community first\" attitude. You will get reliable service, well prepared meals, and some of the best home brewed beer in Pittsburgh. The trifecta.  I've never had a meal here that's disappointed me. There's always half off appetizers too, every day, 10p-midnight. So if you want a late snack, you can get a hefty portion of cheese fries or breaded zucchini for a very competitive price. Drink prices for the amazing brews are reasonable too. For $3 during happy hour (excluding high gravity) you can try one of the ever changing list of carefully crafted beers. At the end of the night too feel free to buy a 6-pack of select favorites, and maybe you'll find a new go-to for your next trip. There's a beer here for every taste and preference.  Rivertowne will mostly deliver an enjoyable time out also. The weekends can get packed, the weekdays are good for just having a drink in a relaxed environment.  Which I guess brings me to my only gripe. Being a big fan of the Pourhouse for years, I will say that I avoid Saturdays anymore. Not because of the establishment whatsoever, but because of the weekend DJs and some of the embarrassment that accompanies them.  Now, I used to enjoy seeing it at first because yes, it absolutely is hysterical to watch 40-50 year old mothers clumsily dancing on... well, the space between tables since there isn't actually a dance floor. But that mixed with some of the younglings who can't handle themselves and the deafening volume of the DJ, the Saturday night visits have become a little less than desirable. Read recent reviews and you'll see that the decibels put out by the DJ are no exaggeration. Its a shame because the weekend DJs are actually very energetic, but having fun does not require one's ears to bleed.  That being said however, if you are looking for an enjoyable night out with family and friends for quality food and beer, you really can't beat Rivertowne Pourhouse in Monroeville. This a fantastic place to frequent, just don't bring grandma past 9:00pm on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Went to Riverview expecting some pub grub and a decent beer. We ended up with great service, outstanding food, tasty beverages, and a pleasant environment. Our table had the \"Rachel\", tuna melt with swiss, and the large bucket of coconut shrimp. We split the HBP; honey bacon homemade chips as an appetizer. The complete n udder destruction pour was delicious. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Lucky enough to live next door, I have an easier walk over than the patrons parking in the lot, but that's the only complaint you will hear out of my mouth. I love going to rivertowne on my days off. When I want a quick delicious meal and an ice cold crafted beer, living so close, I've been lucky enough to try several items from their menu. Their mussels with the beer and garlic is some of the best I've ever had from western pa. Which being a Florida native, let's face it, is a seriously compliment. Seriously though, their mussels are amazing! The French onion soup or beer cheese soup is also awesome when it comes to apps. Forgetting to mention the buffalo chicken dip and spinach and artichoke dip. They are also spectacular. Meal wise, I have yet to have a bad experience. From the big kahuna, turkey bacon ranch wedgie, or the tuna steak melt, all are amazing sandwiches. Their pizzas, subs, and buckets are also amazing! The food may seem simple, but with today's chef's trying to make some complicated nonsense work, it's a delicious  menu with amazing taste. Not to mention I haven't even gotten into the beer! They're all so good and I would highly suggest the sampler when trying to find a favorite, although I haven't been able to name one their yet, since they're all so amazing!"}
{"text":"Was unsure of where to eat in the area. Very good burgers and blueberry beer! Would love to come here again."}
{"text":"This place is terrific, down home, pub food with a local twist and a great inhouse-brewed beer selection.   The array of beers - all good (try the samplers of 7) cover IPAs to an excellent stout and fabulous Scotch Ale. And there's a surprisingly nice pineapple highlighted beer (I usually hate fruitified beer - but this is great.)  We shared nice appetizers - Scotch Eggs, fried zuchini).   But the best part for me was the fish and chips - made with wonderfully nice thick pieces of cod, battered perfectly and served alongside terrific fries.  This is the best fish and chips I've had outside of London (actually, including London.)"}
{"text":"Great food and wide variety of great beer.  Today we enjoyed Jambalya balls appetizer, a great pizza, and the seafood mac & cheese.  Everything was cooked perfectly and we had lots of leftovers (on purpose).  We plan to come back again!!!"}
{"text":"In town and a big fan of micro brews.  When I found a local place i was stoked.  Beer was so so.  Food was average. Service was bad.  Waitress was miserable and acted like we were bothering her when we needed another beer.   Disappointing."}
{"text":"I love the hell outta the Rivertowne. Here's why:  1. The Rivertowne's wings are fabulous. The wing special on Wednesday night is not to be missed: WHOLE buffalo wings for 75 cents each. The wings are fresh, and huge -- and definitely aren't those cheesy little drumsticks or flats you pay way too much for at other places.   2. Check their website for their several 'happy hours' with discounts on booze, but more importantly, with half-price appetizers that are HUGE and delicious.  The Bacon-Cheddar Ranch fries is a huge plate of fries covered with REAL cheese and REAL bacon. Yeah, your arteries will scream with every bite, but at least you'll die happy.   3. I haven't eaten anything here that wasn't delicious. I travel quite a bit and have suffered through some unfortunate restaurants  -- but the Rivertowne isn't one of these unfortunates.   4. I even have brought my nephews and nieces here -- this place is definitely a family-friendly place. The waitstaff are super and accommodating.  5. Free wi-fi.  Great food, great brews and free wi-fi makes this place my little slice of heaven."}
{"text":"The Pour House is my go-to spot for hanging out with friends, and I also suggest it as a good non-chain place to eat in Monroeville, which is otherwise by no means a culinary destination in the Pittsburgh area.  The main reason to go here is the beer: fresh, often-changing, very well crafted (favorites: Last Chance VIenna Lager, White Lightning - which are mostly regulars - do make it a point to try the seasonals first and have the favorites to fall back on).  Happy hour, 10pm-midnight weeknights, $3 pints and 1/2 off apps.  Because of this, I've had all of the appetizers eligible for this discount and my favorites are the scotch eggs and quesadillas - the dips are good too, but a bit heavy and gooey for my tastes most of the time.  From the menu, I've had the catfish bucket and a few sandwiches, and they're good - this isn't fine dining, it's a brewpub.    The service is usually very good, and whenever we've had issues, the management is always quick to fix."}
{"text":"Big selection of beer which are priced high 5.00 a pop. Food is weird like they take common dishes and add werid things to them. Had a beer and me and gf could not find one thing on menu that we would want to try."}
{"text":"The beer is nice, the food is great. But if you are looking to feel welcomed, go some place else. Our first trip there we were belittled by the local patrons for watching soccer. They then proceeded to make fun of how we looked, our age and our body shape. As the remarks kept coming, we just paid our tab and left.  I wouldn't reccomend going unless you were over the age of 60 and a white male. The experience ruined our day."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for great beer, and RiverTowne definitely has that. They have an awesome selection of draught beers on their menu, although it's never entirely clear which ones they actually brew (the menu doesn't say, and the \"replacement draughts\"...who makes those?)  We ordered several different brews, and I loved each one I tried.    On this visit, I figured I'd go for what I know they do well: pizza and fried food. The Blast Furnace pizza is delicious, with good but not heavy crust. The fries with cheese and bacon were guilt-inducing, but yummy. The fried shrimp were big and juicy and definitely a good value. While I have had some disappointing items here before, on this visit I enjoyed everything I tasted.  By the time we finished eating, I was very full from food and beer and ready to roll out the door.  I really enjoyed the beer and food on this visit, but I have to comment on the service/prices aspect. The front of the beer menu we were given indicated a happy hour special during the time we were there.  However, when the check came that discount was not reflected.  When I asked the server, she indicated that the happy hour special was only valid \"for the bar and the high-top tables\", but that she could give us the price if we asked.  I feel that is false advertising and not fair to your customers. If you want to offer happy hour, then have a specific policy in your menu or ask customers where they want to sit. You can't selectively price it.   That said, I will definitely be back for the beer, but will be more cautious about expecting any specials."}
{"text":"We had a good time here Saturday night because our sever was great and the DJ was entertaining. However my wife's beer tasted a little sour and we notice mold in the brew lines. (Gross) We also had their chicken nachos. They were burnt and had no tasted to them at all. If it weren't for the great services I would have given themone star."}
{"text":"It's always fun here!  There are so many interesting things to try and everything tastes like its made in-house (definitely  the beers are) and it's all GREAT!  The servers are all awesome and many have been there for years.  Low turnover=they treat you right!"}
{"text":"I usually go to Rivertowne at least once a week in the fall as their pumpkin beer was my favorite...until this year. It tasted like miller lite with cinnamon sugar around the rim. Apparently they changed their recipe and no longer brew with real pumpkins, but now use a pre-made mix? Well, you can definitely tell. It was so bad that I didn't even finish my drink. Hoping that they stop taking short cuts and go back to making quality pumpkin beer next season."}
{"text":"Rivertowne has been our go to microbrewery  gor the padt 10 years. Today we came for our big family get together before we all seperated for various colleges. We found out that instead of a great microbrewery with great food its now a good microbrewery with bar food. Very disappointed. Menu is cut in half, so dont look at the menu list its not accurate. Good is more expensive and some menu otems have been cut in half. If you want good beer, come here. If you want good food as well, maybe try some place else."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Very greasy, but good wings, pizza and sandwiches. My biggest complaint is that the tables and restaurant are always so dirty, so it makes me wonder what the kitchen is like. There is always some sort of sticky build up on the tables each time I've been here and there is always on old dishrag smell."}
{"text":"Found this place on the way back home from the steel city con. The atmosphere was nice, the staff was friendly and the food was quite good. I had the coconut shrimp bucket and some sirraacha cheese fries. It was delicious. It took a little long to get the check but other than that I recommend."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years when we come in town for the comic con. Service is always fast & friendly. It can get loud if you sit in the bar area, but if you sit in the lower level it isn't  as loud. Food is usually consistent. However, after going there 3 out of 4 nights this past weekend, we were kinda disappointed with our meal Sunday night. Their cheese bites were cold in the center, & my boyfriend said the marinara that was served with it was still frozen. It had to be a fluke, because it was good the other nights we were there. Luckily, my cod sandwich & my boyfriend's burger were cooked just the way we hoped. You can tell the cod is homemade, because of the batter, & it was about an inch thick!  Never really had anything bad there. So, we'll be back! Oh, & their bacon cheddar cheese fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local places. All of the beer on tap is their own with options for every beer drinker. Lots of delicious choices on the menu, some of the most memorable being the Scotch  eggs, mussels, and nachos.  They have team trivia on Mondays with some great prizes! The staff is very nice and accommodating.  The only issue I have is that the food can be a bit inconsistent at times."}
{"text":"Great local place with very good & fresh food, reasonable prices, and terrific service.  We were shocked at how quickly our order was taken & the food arrived, given the place was packed for a playoff hockey game.  I have visited twice now when in town for business...looking forward to another meal tonight!  Keep up the great work. Brian from Boston area P.S. - wasn't rooting for the Penguins!!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here since it changed ownership from The Parkway Tavern to The Rivertowne! This was our favorite place for the longest time, the craft beers they had were always excellent and the choices and flavors were hands down the best in the area. The food freshness, quality and variety never disappointed!   However, I am not sure exactly what has happened lately. This is probably the second visit that we have there in the past 6 months, and while this visit was slightly better than the last time. The food quality and service has declined significantly. Perhaps they've changed ingredients or began multi-purposing existing ingredients? None the less, it was unfortunately a disappointment. We hope that this review may get things back to the prior glory of the Rivertowne pourhouse so that we may return for food, not just drinks. More importantly, the area that formerly housed the beer making equipment (seemingly not currently in use) appeared to have mold on the overhead pipe coverings. As a health hazard we really hope that this issue will be remedied quickly, if it's not being currently tended to."}
{"text":"It really doesn't get better than this! Great beer sampler, excellent Mac and cheese, the fish sandwich is delicious and your can't go wrong with the Cajun chicken pasta!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere for happy hour. Great tasting beers on tap! Especially love the Pineapple beer!"}
{"text":"Don't be afraid to try this place because of the home brews. They're really good. Good pub food, good pub atmosphere. Only thing on the menu I don't like is their fresh cut fries. They're soggy and greasy. Also, on Friday and Saturday nights, they have a dj who plays music extremely too loud for a restaurant this size."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant/bar atmosphere that puts one in mind of Hofbrauhaus without the loud old-country music. The service is decent and the food is delicious and filling with large portions. I love the Big Kahuna sandwich which blends an unexpected BBQ sauce and honey mustard blend with meat and cheese. Can't beat it! The great part is that for a mid 20-something like me, this place works for a transition from dinner to later-night drinks. The home-grown beer selection is large. I appreciate that all beers are light enough to enjoy with your meal. This location is worth the drive; luckily I live in Monroeville. Check it out and I doubt you'd be disappointed."}
{"text":"I only stopped by once while visiting the area.  I was staying at the Residence Inn a couple miles away and found this place on Yelp.  The parking lot is across the street from the building.  If it weren't for the guy wearing a \"Rivertowne Pour House\" tee-shirt walking to the place I would've been confused as to where to go.  From the outside the place looks a little divey, which is a selling point in my book, but the interior is a bit more casual with beer mugs hanging above the bar all with their owner's ID tags.  Quite a nice touch.  The food is better than average.  The menu is a bit inventive without getting away from being pub fare.  We ordered from the happy hour menu, small plates for $5, the scotch eggs and jambalaya balls.  Both were good though the scotch eggs were a bit heavy on sausage.  Definitely worth the ten dollars.  The real gem of this place is the beer.  All brewed in house and really good.  I had the Arctic Amber, a few of them actually.  My girlfriend was a little disappointed they didn't have a housemade cider and settled for the only one they carried. I could see being a regular if I lived here!"}
{"text":"Had a surprise birthday party here and the venue was great for our size party. Rivertowne has a nice, intimate private room, inclusive of bar and restrooms. The food and service (Randi) was great and the manager, Gina, worked with me on all of my concerns. I just wish guests didn't have to cross a main road to access the restaurant. This is a brewhouse so don't expect domestics like I did, but we will go back to try a meal in the restaurant to add that 5th star!"}
{"text":"The group of family from out of town  9 of us  together were all extremely disappointed we had the worst onion soup ever no flavor, awful steak salad ice cold fries x2, philly steak cold and over cooked, calamari and shrimp soggy and cold, x2 also won't be back"}
{"text":"After tonight's game (Celtics vs. Heats game 4) me and my girlfriend found our selves starving, it was really late, maybe around 11:45, after an extensive search, since we are here from Boston for work, we found the only place around that the kitchen was still open was RiverTowne PourHouse. So we went out for an extremely late dinner .. As soon as we arrived we sat ourselves down and waited for a server, surprisingly our server Doug greated us within seconds of us arriving .. And it was all great after that !!! Since the menu was quite large and i have a decission making issues He helped us pick and choose our app and dinner plates, and I gotta say it was all really good.  Thanks RiverTowne !!  This is a Review from 1 to 2 years ago"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you! It looks a bit run down on the outside but it's pretty nice on the inside. It has that typical, small-town pub feel to it. My mom and I went at 10 PM because of the half-off apps and the 3.50 brews.   Service: Our waitress was very friendly! Food came out fast (granted there weren't many there at 10 PM) and we never had to wait too long for anything.   Food:  I got the Scotch Eggs and the Cajun Catfish bucket. The scotch eggs were great! I've had scotch eggs before, but never with Italian sausage.  The small order of the Catfish bucket gives you a big piece of fish and a ton of fries. The fish was really crispy and tender on the inside. It must've been battered like a hush puppy because there was a slight sweetness to it that I really enjoyed. The fries were good as well.  My mom got the calamari and the shrimp and grits. The calamari was good but nothing special. They give you a lot which I appreciate. I didn't have the sausage or shrimp from my mom's dish, but she said they were well seasoned and cooked beautifully. She said it was probably the best shrimp and grits dish she'd ever had. I tried some of her grits and they were AMAZING. Super creamy and flavorful. I love grits and they're really easy to mess up, so I'm glad that I now have a place to get a good grits dish if I'm up for it.  Overall, 4.5/5! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"BEST SECRET SPOT FOR GREAT BREW!  This is a classic Pittsburgh bar and grill that happens to be a microbrewery. The food is solid bar food. Good pizza, large portions of wings and things! The real star is the great work of the former John Harvard's brew master. You got to try what's on tap! Chocolate Stout mmm good! Apricot Beer - smells awesome tastes sweet!  Also - is your TV on the fritz?? Is the Steeler's game on?? This place has DOZENS of huge flat screen TV's and is a great place to watch a game! We went during the Pen's playoffs and that was a lot of fun to be with the hometown crowd.  Menu Fav/Ladies Craving: Pub Pretzels with Hot Fudge!   This is a great dessert of salty and sweet for all the ladies out there with a thing for chocolate! You can also get it as an app with other savory sauces!"}
{"text":"While in Pittsburgh we took a drive to the Rivertowne Pour House Pub. It was very spacious and nice. From the outside it is something of a dive, but inside is very nice.  -As usual I got the sampler. None of the beers shouted out to me, so I won't go through each beer I had but lets say I had the IPA, Pale Ale, Pumpkin and 4 others I can't recall. Sadly none stood out to me but the place was fun.  -For food we had the Scotch Eggs which seemed popular out there, hard boiled eggs wrapped in Italian sausage and deep fried...they were tasty! Also had a deep fried pretzel, also very tasty!  -All in all it was a quick stop, quick bite and a few beer tastes. It was a nice place, but nothing that shouted out to me COME BACK! To check out all their locations check out their website, they apparently also have a tasting room now which I didn't know about then"}
{"text":"Good beer selection, friendly staff and I always recommend the french fries. I got the mandarin blue salad with salmon & french fries. I didn't like the way the salmon was cooked and our waiter (Doug) took it away with no problems and replaced it with shrimp. Also because of the inconvenience he gave me my beer on the house. Definitely handled better then other places I've had issues with me meals."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went with 2 others as they suggested this place for dinner.  While our friends have been here before, it was both,  my boyfriend and my first times at RiverTowne.    Our first thought was Wow, this place was packed!  There was hardly a parking lot in the space across the street.  Our friends arrived earlier so had put our name on the list - I think the total wait was about 45 mins for 4 people at around 6:30pm on a Saturday.. pretty standard.  The bar area is large with many seats and tables surrounding.  The whole restaurant and dining area seems to have many rooms and able to accommodate many people - especially larger parties.  I am a sucker for microbrews, so I was excited to try all they had to offer.  My boyfriend and I each got one of the samplers/flights.  RiverTowne offers 2 samplers with 7 four oz pours of beers on each for about $9.  The \"Brewmaster\" flight offered the more heavier of the options. Personally, I wanted the Brewmaster for myself, but since we were sharing each it didn't really matter who ordered what.  Of the Assistant Brew Master - my favorites were the Hala Kahiki- Pineapple Ale and the Old Wylie's IPA. While, the Brewmaster samples had more to my liking, a couple of my favorites were Maxwell's Scottish Ale and Baby Got Bock.    Once our food arrived, we were all starving and ready for some good eats.  I got a burger.. lately I have been craving a good burger. I am yet to find this good burger.  RiverTowne's blackened bleu burger was good, but not great. My boyfriend got the crab cakes - I was skeptical about his order, but he's a big boy, so he can get what he wants.. but my suspicions were correct. Out came two small mostly bread cakes, with homemade chips and coleslaw. Very poor presentation and for $16.99 definitely not worth it. Our friends both got wraps which looked good.   The final verdict on this place is it would be a great place to go for happy hour beers and some appetizers or for a casual dinner with typical bar food. I also heard on Monday nights they have trivia - I think at 9pm (dont quote me) but that would be fun to get a couple drinks with friends and play trivia! If you stick to that and are in the mood for some good brews, this place would be just fine!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular and the bartenders are always fun and give great service.  They only serve their own beer brewed in house.  They have over 18 beers on tap, so there is something for everyone.  The pizza is great and you can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches.  They have a great late night happy hour 10-12, and their kitchen is open late."}
{"text":"Good handcrafted beer. Pittsburgh sandwich is a tasty, unusual combination. Great neighborhood spots for kids and adults."}
{"text":"Always reliable would be Rivertowne. For us, part of the appeal is that they brew they're own beer. Secondly, fries are fresh cut and menu is diverse. I love the salad selection, and the cheese-stuffed pretzels are great. The portion sizes are a bit overwhelming, but that's not always a bad thing. It's a great place to take family that's in from out-of-town, or a good place to stop for a beer and appetizer with some friends."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Very attentive staff and bartenders. Huge variety of draft which contain a lot of freshly brewed beers. The taste is so crispy. I love their chicken wings and also the loaded nachos. A very nice place for hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Went again on Friday night. Excellent service as always! This time I had the cheese bites as apps (Yummo!) and had the Prime Rib special which included a salad, baked potato, corn on the cob and of course prime rib for $16.99! It was freaking outstanding! Screw Hyde Park! I'm coming here!   FYI: Stay clear of the raspberry tea as it is always watered down."}
{"text":"They changed the menu... no more fresh cut fries or small pizzas! The kids menu no longer has a cheeseburger. Very disappointed because this used to be our favorite place!"}
{"text":"The food is average bar fare but the beer is really good. I'd go back for the beer not the food. Having said that, I don't think I will ever go back. Too many other places to explore."}
{"text":"Good so far! I like Tuesday half off apps and the weekends r fun with the dj! It's a spacious clean atmosphere with plenty to drink! The salmon is very good!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and have never been disappointed!! Food and beer selection is great!! Had our wedding rehersal dinner here...very pleased!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for several years and incredibly disappointed to find out they have changed their menu. It has become subpar bar food. I wouldn't recommend and do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"Great pizza, awesome beer. We surprised then with a party of 20+ and they handled with very little error."}
{"text":"Wow. Pittsburgh Kline have found a gem.  Wings WOW. Schrimp and Grits WOW.  And u won't hear me say this ever again...Scottish Balls to balls to die for!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great beer, friendly staff, and an attentive server. Atmosphere is casual but bustling. The parking lot for the place was nearly full but we got a table in less than a minute. My husband and I had the cajun pasta and catfish bucket, with the marzen bier and pineapple ale. All of it was great. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"It's ok.  We live in Monroeville but rarely go.  I think the food is really greasy.  Prices are reasonable - waitstaff is fine - beer is good according to my husband.  I just can't enjoy that overly fried/greasy taste of the fries, appetizers, etc.  The atmosphere would be fun for a big game if you sit at the bar, but if you get stuck in the back of the restaurant it's really isolated."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places to go in the Monroeville area, also my favorite out of the Rivertowne locations (I consider the brewery to be too different to compare, though). There is a ton of space, which means most times there is no wait. In the main room, I love all of the wood decor - makes it feel homey. Service is generally in the range of good to great. The Pour House has a nice neighborhood vibe to it, which I enjoy.  There are always a good amount of beers on draft, which change seasonally. They also have a few beer sample flights available. So no matter what kind of beer you like, chances are, they'll have something for you.   I would describe the food as tasty bar food. More info in the next 2 paragraphs:  The cheese bite appetizer is EXCELLENT. I think the beer batter must add a lot to the flavor. It's definitely our appetizer of choice to order. You get a good amount in the app - for me, it's a little too much for 2 people but perhaps a bit skimpy for 4 people (so if you have 3 people in your party, you may find you have just the right amount of cheese bites :).  I've enjoyed various sandwiches and burgers as well. Recently they've added a healthy menu, and I tried one of the healthy menu fish dishes the other night (it came with 2 sides as well as a side salad - great value). It was good, and I look forward to trying another healthy option some other time.    Biggest downside: Their sound system. When the place is really packed, you may not be able to hear the sound for a given sporting event. We were pretty disappointed last year when we went there to watch a Pens playoff game and couldn't even hear the sound. On the other end of the spectrum, they have a DJ some nights... and the music is played WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too loudly for my taste. I make sure to get out of there before that starts up."}
{"text":"Well this was not what I expected at all! We went here tonite for the western burger and 4 cheese steak wrap. Oops they changed there menu. Oh really...um we went from 7 page menu to 2 sided wt???? Total disappointment. NO BURGERS...NO WRAPS.  Are they trying to go under or stay afloat..very disappointed used to be a regular. Never again it just out right sucked...beer wasn't up to par in my eye either. Think there in trouble. Sorry Rivertowne but you lost us!"}
{"text":"This was recommended by several of the folks in the CPR class my wife was teaching.  The food was just so-so,  I had a buffalo chicken wrap and fries that were adequate but not outstanding.  The Spinach Dip appetizer tasted like mostly cream cheese.  It had too little of the flavorful hard cheeses that are supposed to make such a thing really sing, and it could benefit from a much heartier helping of actual spinach.  The beer was worth the trip.  I ordered one of the sampler paddles of their beers.  Two notes, the IPA was delicious and I eventually ordered a full size one. I couldn't even get past the smell of the cherry flavored one.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"Portions are so immense you will bust. But delicious and savory nonetheless.  I was impressed with the menu which is not a common feat.  The food variety offered is an eclectic mix of randomness.  What you could expect from a 'pourhouse' (since we all know what a traditional pour house menu would look like.... haha).  Everything that I tried was sumptuous and satisfying.  The cheese dip thing with the pitas changed my life.  I also had a kind of wrappish like thing with ranch and chicken and bacon and yummmmm  I would recommend stopping in for a casual meal if you are in the vicinity.  Lots of young people, good for adult groups and get togethers with some drinks and tasty foodstuffs.  Pleasure your intestines and your friends simultaneously!"}
{"text":"This place was a surprise! Looks like your average dive. The food is served in big portions. We got the nachos (yummy) for an appetizer they fed our table of 5 with leftovers. I ordered the coconut shrimp and it was juicy, fresh, and the coconut breading was delicious. The biggest shrimp I have ever seen.  Service was average due to being packed, but that's understandable. Adding this to my favorite list!"}
{"text":"Excellent craft beer and delicious food!  I have been here many times and have never been disappointed.  Everything from the soft pretzels (my favorite) to full meals is delicious."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Unique beers. I loved the pineapple beer. Unique foods too.  A good place to meet with friends after work. Great service too"}
{"text":"So many choices... Seafood, pizza, burger. I came with some colleagues and the two things we all agreed: food is delicious, but a little messy ;-) definitely need to wash your hands after eating here. I liked the Mahi-mahi tacos and the both enjoyed the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong...  I like Rivertowne Pour House (and Rivertowne North Shore and Rivertowne Brewery).  It represents a great mid-way point when I want to meet the family for dinner vs. one of us having to make an hour-plus drive in our out of the city.  Being a huge proponent of local breweries, Rivertowne has a few great staple beers (my wife is crazy about the pineapple beer, Hala Kahiki, and I prefer a few of their one off seasonals).  The Pour House also has some great pizza.  Big, fluffy, kind of sweet dough covered with a behemoth of toppings of your choice.  All the other menu staples however are hit or miss (mostly just average).  For some reason, no matter how much I won't object to going to RiverTowne, I also won't propose nor recommend it either.  And for that, I just can't give it the pro-4-star review."}
{"text":"Something like 10 house-brewed beers on tap. And they make their own corned beef! Place was very good!"}
{"text":"Bottom line it's a pittsburgh joint. I only go to mom and pop joints . They care about there product. No  franchise that follows a script for food.  Buffalo creams sauce  over mussels melts in your mouth! The blue cheese and hot sauce cancels each other out, leaving you with a delightful dish . Woke up next morning thinking about them.  In my top pittsburgh places!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent wings, Great selection of Micro-Brews and a nice atmosphere... Overall I enjoyed myself, and will return to try the Pour House again sometime to try a sandwich... by the look on the ladys face next to us she was more than enjoying it."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, friendly staff who are willing to go the extra mile. Rivertowne is my old standby when I need to work late. I can always count on a warm meal there as long as i show up before 2330. At times, i would even call in my order before I arrive and they would have the food ready for me. The great in house drafts are icing on the cake. This is a great place to hang out with friends or by myself."}
{"text":"Coworker:  \"We were thinking about going to RiverFrown for lunch.  Wanna go?\" Me:  \"I don't know, man.  Remember the other 20 times we went there and it took an hour to get our food?\" Coworker:  \"Yeah.  So?\"   Me:  \"Remember that time you got the seafood mac & cheese and you threw up the rest of the afternoon, curled up in the fetal position?\" Coworker:  \"Yeah.\" Me:  \"Does the fact that we call it RiverFROWN, and nothing else, not even phase you?\"   Coworker:  \"I don't know.\"   Me \"...\"   Coworker:  \"...................\"    SO... we just got back from RiverTowne Pour House.  My GOD what in the hell was I thinking?  I had my whole lunch planned out:  go to Giant Eagle, make myself a salad with chicken, maybe get a wedding soup.  I'd already logged it all into my Lose It! app.  620 calories.  Delicious.  I was even toying with the idea of getting an ice cream or something.  I mean, it's Friday; TREAT YO'SELF!    But no, in the spirit of camaraderie, I somehow wind up at mother effing RiverTowne again like a big JERK.  Today was a real doozy, hence me taking the time to write this.  My take-out:  a plastic bag filled with seafood juice.  On top of the juice was the container holding my peel-and-eat shrimp, the inside of said container being bone dry.  I guess they assumed I'd get back to my office and dip the shrimp in my plastic juice bag, one by one.  You know, like a maniac?  Or maybe I'd unload all the dry shrimp into my juice bag and just slosh it around?    Regardless, I had to hold that bag upright with the jaws of life on the drive back because I'll be DAMNED if I spill that seafood juice in the car and make my buddy's interior smell like the docks at Key Largo.      I've yet to mention WHY I got a to-go bag.  We got to RiverTowne at 12:05 PM and ordered at 12:10 PM.  Anyone who's worked in food service knows that you want quick turn-arounds at lunch.  A:  Your customers are usually working and have a limited amount of time to eat.  B:  The faster you can get someone in and out, the more tables you can seat.  The Frown wasn't super crowded today, so I'm guessing B wasn't a concern.  All that being said, our food arrived at 12:58.  I was already cashed out and standing there, arms crossed, with my jacket on, like a pissed off soccer mom who is just FED. UP.  Really, she's had it up to here.    I don't want to make it sound like I'm blaming the waitress, either.  She was great; polite and apologetic.  Something was clearly going on in the kitchen, though.  EVERYONE'S food was taking forever.  There was a table of 6 next to us who was going through the same thing.  But that's all par for the course.  Like I said, we call it RiverFrown for a reason.   Not that it even matters, but I got the shrimp back to my office, ate it, and it was gross; the saltiest shrimp I've ever eaten in my life.  The owner of my company told me that's what restaurants do when their food is spoiled - they salt the hell out of it.  That's great.  Hopefully, he's an idiot and way off base, but now that I think about it, I feel terrible.  Could just be all the sodium and my already spiked blood pressure.  If I keel over, this post will likely be my final words.  Profound.    Just stay away.  I can, without a doubt, say that in my 7 years of working in this area, RiverTowne is by far the worst lunch experience you can have - and we eat out every single day.  This one time, my hand got trapped in between some rocks while hiking through the canyons of southeast Utah and I had to spend 127 hours there, trapped.  After days of delirium caused by dehydration and the drinking of my own urine, I eventually had to cut off my hand with a pocket knife to escape the canyon and find help.  I would rather relive that horrible experience every single day than spend one more minute of my life in RiverTowne Pour House. Take that with a grain of shrimp - I mean, salt.  PEACE."}
{"text":"The best part about the RiverTowne is the seasonal pumpkin beer!  My fiance and I love it!  That being said, the place is way to small especially the bar area.  Almost impossible to get waited on as others were commenting and if you don't get to sit at the bar or near the front, you do feel very isolated.  The location in Monroeville has better beer selections than the one in North Huntington, and actually have a beer menu unlike N.H location. Not to mention the waiter had no clue what beers they had on tap.  Well that makes it challenging.  But they had pool tables and again, if they are serving the pumpkin I am going for that!  Other than the beers, I would probably prefer to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go. I'm a big fan of the ole' pub. Clubs, no thanks. Give me a nice little bar with some real people, some character, and good food and beer.  Rivertowne meets those needs for me. I have had not great food and service before, but that's life. Everyone has their days.   I've been here dozens of times, and if we're looking at an average, they usually are above average. 9 times out of 10 their beers are a hit, and their food is usually more than I'm willing to eat in one sitting, no matter what I order.  If you're looking for lavish 5 star treatment every second, time to go somewhere else. If you want a comfy spot to meet up with friends and imbibe, this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars.  Got there on a Friday and waited almost a half hour for a table, which was understandable. Our waiter was TJ and he was pretty helpful, especially with the beer selection. Tired to take me out of my comfort zone of trying \"safe beers\", which I appreciated.   My husband ordered some type of sub and I ordered seafood pizza and French onion soup.   The sandwich was decent, but had its limitations. Bread was just ok, but being toasted helped cover up its flaws. The meat tasted very good, but didn't come with a whole lot of meat, however it was still filling (hubby's take on it). I feel like it was mostly just bread. Would have been a great sandwich if there was more meat. As far as fries are concerned, they weren't that great. I guess you could call them crispy, but there was really no flavor, and drenching them in ketchup/ranch is really the only way to truly enjoy them. I wish they offered a beer battered fry, or something with a thicker texture (to me they compare very similarly to Primanti's fries).   My seafood pizza was tasty and came with a generous amount of seafood on it. However, I was pretty disappointed when I did not taste any crabmeat, which is usually the favorite part of this pizza for me. As I started eating it, I noticed that there was cod in place of the crab meat. I asked our server if this was something new and he said he was not aware of any changes to the menu, however I can guarantee you that this was not the same pizza I have been ordering for years. Slightly disappointed because of that and probably will not order this pizza again because crab trumps fish, in my opinion.   Bathrooms were small and OK. Wouldn't quite call them clean, but they were clean enough to be used. Parking was really tight, and I had to park in a non-space just to go inside. Rivertown has always been one of our favorite places to visit, but we were just a little underwhelmed this time."}
{"text":"We got there around seven o'clock with a group of six.  Beer was very good, I recommend the pizza Youghiogheny, one of the best anywhere.  DJ Gray arrived about 9:30.  The music was so loud and so distorted that we left within ten minutes.  People at the bar were looking at him and shaking their heads.  He was without a doubt, the worst DJ I've heard since college.  He ruined a very fun evening."}
{"text":"I wanted to share while the disappointment was fresh.   Rivertowne recently changed their menu. They used to have the best wings in town: Jumbo. Full-Size. Non-Breaded. With skin that snapped in your mouth when you bit it. If you got a large to-go, there would have been two styrofoam containers, steaming with wings.  Now Rivertowne has wing dings. A large order is one styrofoam container, 3/4 full of wing pieces. The skin is no longer snappy. The amount of food has shrunk to the size of an appetizer.   The cheesesteak has also been changed in the new menu. The meat quality is still good, but there is so little of it. The cheese is a weak squirt of cheesewhiz mixed with beer (yuk!), but there's not enough of it to really worry about it. The cheesesteak is mostly bread now.  For comparison sake I should add this bit: We immediately went to Wendy's after seeing how the portion sizes shrunk. So when I got home, I had to choose between eating the Jr. Cheeseburger Deluxe or the Rivertowne cheesesteak. The Jr. Cheeseburger Deluxe was soggy on the top, with an anemic-looking patty in the middle, and a hard bottom bun, stale from being left on the warmer for too long.   I ate the Wendy's first."}
{"text":"Visited 3 times during the week of 07/20/09. Beer was excellent and food was good and very affordable. The peel and eat shrimp were $10 a pound which is what I have to pay for shrimp here in mn at the grocery store. Also had the fish and chips and the pittsburgh sandwich. Food isn't  fancy or anything but i really like the place. If I were a Monroeville resident I would hang out at Rivertowne."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday for brunch with three dining companions.  The restaurant looked nice upon entering with a bar and fireplace in the area that we entered.  We were led back to our table in a not as nice room that was pretty bland but that was not a big deal.  A minute or so after we were seated we thought it was weird that the music became fairly loud while playing LMFAO's \"Sexy and I Know It\".  Sadly this was not to be an isolated incident and at what seemed to be random intervals, loud dance music was piped into the area in which we were sitting.  Since it was brunch time we all decided upon having the buffet brunch that had looked enticing while we walked past it to our tables.  The price was not terribly cheap but made sense seeing how they had prime rib, an omelet bar and other stations with a little more upscale feel.  When we ordered our waitress told us that the prime rib may be gone and so we hurried over to get some of the last pieces as shortly thereafter it was replaced with Roast Beef.  The omelet station had a nice selection of meats, vegetables and cheeses and the cook was good enough.  In addition to the normal eggs, french toast, sausage and bacon on the buffet there was also stuffed peppers, teriyaki chicken on a stick and fish and vegetables.  As with most buffets all of it was satisfactory tasting although nothing was great.  They also had a dessert table set up with a few different types of desserts on it.  Sadly most of it was bland and tasteless or had a terrible consistency and our table went through about five different items before we found something that was mediocre.  Honestly I do not think that I have ever had a pumpkin pie before where the crust overpowered the taste of the pie.  The bottom line for me is that I will probably not be coming back to this restaurant in the future.  Although the food was satisfactory the high price point of the brunch and poor execution of desserts will keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"Good local place.  Fried zucchini was great.  Philly was good.  Great local and brewed beers.  Good service."}
{"text":"Ok, so the atmosphere was pretty cool. Casual dining and bar area with an array of beer signs and TVs. Looks like a pleasant family spot up until about 9pm when the over 21 crowd takes over the bar area for a night of socializing and chit chat.   Food wasn't bad, even though they messed up 2 out of 5 orders. They had they typical bar sandwiches and appetizers. They tried to break out of the typical menu with an interesting mix of pasta concoctions with peppers and other fun accent veggies. Half of the menu was guy heaven with fried this and that.   The guys loved it because apparently they have a great beer selection's, but  I'm not a big beer fan. My BF said they carry a nice selection of IPA's and they had all of the current Sam Adams on tap. The staff was very friendly from start to finish, so for that they get 4 stars!."}
{"text":"Great food! The all-you-can-eat crab is awesome! The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the service during peek hours is terrible. If you go at 4 or 5 for dinner, you'll be in and out in no time. However, I went with some friends around 8 pm one night, and they got my order wrong twice, forgot our beers, and I could see our waiter drinking at the bar while neglecting our party. Maybe I just had a bad rogue waiter. Great food, just don't go when its busy."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by their new menu. I will not return until it is revised. I went to Dad's instead and had a great burger. I really enjoyed going here. The staff was always excellent and the food was delicious and somewhat affordable. You will be missed."}
{"text":"Great selection of craft drafts.  The barkeep was prompt, friendly and did the follow-up.  Not a foodie stop, just wanted to visit an old haunt and try out the beer.  The Amish furniture is cool.  Most of the parking is across the street."}
{"text":"Kudos, the Pumpkin beer was fantastic!  Jalapeño bites  were the bomb, highly recommend!  Steak quesadilla with Salsa, sour cream, and hot sauce was completely yummy! Pacino was delish... Slight issue with the pastrami sandwich being over cooked, our server was helpful in resolving the issue."}
{"text":"Love their beers!  Especially the Suburban Housewife, pumpkin and Rudolph's Red!  They made some changes to their menu but their deep dish pizza is delish!  Their cheesecake is out of this world!  Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Loved coming here a few years ago. This was my choice restaurant for getting hammered on Friday and Saturday nights. The bartenders can appear stressed but otherwise they're decent. DELICIOUS COCONUT SHRIMP!! Oh the mixed drinks are good too. I wanna go to eat there soon. I don't drink much anymore so my visits have been less frequent. But I tell ya, I used to get \"turnt\" ( as the younger kids would say)"}
{"text":"Dined here solo during a business trip and sat at the bar.  I have to agree with the countless other reviewers go here for the beer.    Service was efficient but lacked personality.  Bar tender practically threw my sampler at me and offered no explanation of the beers. Eh, no biggie their beer menu lists the descriptions of their two sampler flights.  I had the Brewmasters Flight which was great.  Wasn't a huge fan of the Hala Kahiki, their Pineapple beer, but I thought their IPAs were great.  Since I share some Polish heritage, the menu item that immediately caught my eye was the Pierogi Pizza.  It was good but filling, needed a box for the leftovers. Surprisingly the bartender brought a box over without having to ask.    FYI-Monday is bar trivia night; great for groups, depressing if you're a party of one.  Despite the personality lacking bartenders, I'd head back my next time in town."}
{"text":"Great food presentation. Bar seating a little limited for a \"Pour House\", but okay atmosphere. Check out the honey-bacon homemade potato chips. They are the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"I had to go here a few times before I felt qualified to write a review. The most redeeming quality of this place is its selection of home-brewed beers. If you like beer, stop reading  I do not like beer, so I have to go with the food. The food is ok. Their selection of pizzas is wide and what they do make is among the best I've had in the monroeville area.   Their regular food is not much better than what you'd find at a Denny's. Last thing I tried was a ruben which felt like it had been heated in the microwave, then placed in toast. Meat was REALLY hot, and the bread was warm, but not crispy as if it had been properly grilled.  In summary, stick to the beer and pizza and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"I had the worst dessert of my life here. The pineapple bites are horrid in taste and presentation. The pineapple tasted sour and the fried coating was greasy and had no flavor. Also who puts lettuce as a garnish on dessert? No really lettuce? I couldn't believe my eyes. The rest of the meal had it's ups and downs. The pierogie pizza was excellent. It takes a loooong time to make so be prepared to wait for it. The crust had a nice flavor to it and it's very filling. The western meatloaf was described as okay not mind blowing but edible by my co diner. The restaurant itself could use some upgrading. The carpeting was ugly and the the tables so tiny that our server had to remove the salt, pepper, and sugar containers from the table to fit our plates and drinks. I'd go back for the pizza nothing else."}
{"text":"WTF happened to the menu? I thought I was at the local Fox's pizza but then I realized there was beer. No burgers (once again WTF)! Did the account get shut off at restaurant depot? No longer need a chef just a line cook from Denny's will do oh wait they have entrees he may be over qualified. They must have also downsized on utensils because our table never received any. Wow!! The pourhouse needs to change its spelling to you know what, here it comes, poorhouse. Betcha seen that coming. Two stars because they still serve beer."}
{"text":"Menu was your typical bar food, with several  unique options thrown in.  All the food was delicious!   Prices were excellent, portions were large, definitely leftovers to take home!     Our service was attentive to our needs.   Loved the atmosphere and style of the restaurant.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I was tempted to make a meal of the beer selection,  but decided that since I had to drive home, ordering some food was probably a wise choice. Their beer selection was one of the most unique mix of options I have ever seen.  Being fall, I tried the pumpkin beer.  The glass came with the rim cinnamon coated and the beer had a great pumpkin taste that wasn't overpowering.  I loved it and wanted to try more but opted instead to try their pineapple beer.  I love pineapple, I love beer, so how could I go wrong?!  I've had other fruit beers before and been disappointed, but I LOVED the pineapple brew.  It had a pineapple flavor but still retained the beer quality so it wasn't just like drinking a carbonated pineapple juice.  I think on my next visit, I'm going to get a growler to take home with me. The food menu was typical pub food, although there were some twists (they had fried cheese cubes instead of cheese sticks).   I was at Rivertown for an event.  I look forward to a repeat visit for an actual sit down meal.  And more pineapple beer."}
{"text":"What a great place! We'd been to the brewery in Murrysvillle for spooky brew tours, but first time to the restaurant. It's in the location of the former Parkway Tavern, please be careful crossing the street!! We sat at the bar, the bartender was awesome and so sweet! As DD, I enjoyed an iced tea, my partner liked the schloppy monster beer! For dinner, I had yinzer salad, with blackened shrimp and balsamic vinaigrette... Ordered mine without onions. So flipping delicious! The cucumber was cut like French fries- cool idea. The dressing was creamy different but good. He's having ordered chorizo Scotch eggs, which don't have the breading layer, he prefers this! His entrée: Catfish and chips- very good catfish - literally fresh potato chips. Very good, holy leftover salad, as I assisted with Scotch eggs!"}
{"text":"Yesterday we went back after a few years to this Monroeville location to have their famous Mandarin Blue Salad. It's famous by us, we love it.  The beer selection is always good, you have options to choose from, try and enjoy but they serve their beer in these stackable water glasses. You actually get cheated because they're not large enough as the regular 16 oz glass (I watched the girl make drinks and mix them with a regular american pint size glass). Oh, and get this: they serve their water in english pint beer glasses!  We're bummed out that they fry their pretzels but we ordered them anyway, the beer cheese that they came with was like jelly, very questionable. The other RiverTowne locations are great to hang out at, I can't say this same for this one in Monroeville, I'm glad we don't live near it."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and micro brewery! Clean and reasonably priced with a friendly, knowledgeable staff! Nice menu selections to satisfy most palates!"}
{"text":"Its ok. Nothing to write home to some about but it is defiantly a homey kind of place and I would be there often if I was a local for the bar. That aside the fish and chips was better than average but other than that the Pittsburg sandwich was just ok and the homemade root beer was just ok meaning to would not crave it ever."}
{"text":"So sad. We've been going to Rivertowne since it first opened in Monroeville and it's always been our absolute favorite place to eat. Unfortunately they've recently changed the menu and the quality of the food has gone down. It used to be exceptional but now it's just basic bar food. The fresh cut steak fries are gone, replaced by skinny little french fries. The boneless wings and rest of the food was just not up to the usual standard. The 6-7 pages of menu were reduced to one page front and back. The only dessert is now cheesecake and it's not good, and the \"chocolate sauce\" was obviously Hershey's syrup. And the prices went up - $5.50 to add chicken to your quesadilla (it was $3).  Higher prices, lower quality. I'm so disappointed, but after 10 years of loving this place, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food here is great. Had the portabello mushroom app and the perogi pizza. Oh my god, the perogi pizza had me singing. I am going to look for this pizza wherever I go now, but I have a sinking feeling it's never going to top this place.  The beer isn't bad, but isn't what I expect out of a craft brew. I've been into sour beers lately, and have especially been on a berlinerweis kick and this place was sort of interesting that you could order the berlinerweis with flavored syrup - shirley temple style.... which I thought was super alarming. But then again, I'm a purist so YMMV... Next time I'm back, I will try the syrup in my beer because the berlinerweis seemed like a good bland background for some sprucing up so perhaps it was made to accomodate that!  Also tried a flight with other beers from the tap and the flavors were very mild except for the pineapple one.. wow that tasted like drinking the pineapple syrup from the bottom of those canned rings which I realized was super quirky and fun. I think if anyone is afraid of trying craft brews, this is probably the best place to start into them because the flavors are very subtle and presents a good stepping stone."}
{"text":"Much better this time around! We sat at a table, not the bar, and our service was excellent. She was totally on point and super friendly.. what a relief ;)  I tried the seafood sub and wasn't crazy about it. Lacked a lot of flavor in my opinion. The hubs ordered the mussels again of course, and loved them just as much this time around. Regardless of my lack-of-love for my food, our faith has been restored in the staff at here, and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A-OK place.  Had the Whit-o-Maker beer here, very good.  Also got the pub pretzels with beer cheese on the side. The pretzels are fried and quite tasty.  The service was friendly and attentive and this place has plenty of TVs to watch the games."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of the food or the service here, but the beer is great.  Our waiter was awesome, but even though they were REALLY busy, a lot of staff members were just hanging around near our table, complaining about other diners and the hour that they were (or weren't) getting off work that Tuesday night.  The food is super greasy, typical pub fare, nothing special.   I think their pizzas are the best thing on the menu, and be warned--although the sizes don't sound that big, they are piled high!  The beer, on the other hand, is VERY special.  Brewed in house, ~20 house varieties that change with the seasons.  Stand-outs from the list were Black & Brewbeery fruit beer, PINEAPPLE beer, vanilla porter, and a couple different styles of IPAs."}
{"text":"I have been there a few times and tonight was the last! Food subpar, beer good. Hardly a crowd there and no one to seat you. When we went looking for a table, most of them were dirty.  Sat down and it took 15 min for someone to come to our table. Waitress said they were having an event but I have no idea where! There was no large crowd. Dinner and appetizer came out together. Not much to the Reuben sandwich and fries. Disappointed again, last time for me there!"}
{"text":"One star for food.  4 stars for beer.  Think twice about the food... the beer is great but the food is consistently bad in quality and in variability of preparation.  I've gone to the Pour House since it was the Parkway Tavern.  The beer is the only thing good there but since it is a convenient location I get sucked in to going there for food also.  My last time there was the worst... the worst nachos that I've ever had, it was literally like the person who made the nachos has never had nachos before, it was a plate of chips with what could have passed as a tossed salad thrown on top - really bizarre!  We also ordered chicken wings which were served well undercooked and with blue cheese sauce that is ranch dressing with a couple of blue cheese chunks thrown in (the waitress told me that this is how they make their blue cheese, ranch plus a chunk of cheese).  The hamburger ordered was nothing more than a frozen burger, burnt to a crisp on the outside and red in the middle.  Finally, a white pizza that was a crust with oil, some cheese, then Italian seasoning sprinkled on top of everything.  I think my middle school children would have prepared the food better!"}
{"text":"Little rundown.  Food ok...beers were great, had IPA and imperial stout...service was slow but friendly.  Overall, if in area, check it out, just don't expect much."}
{"text":"Great little place! Friendly staff. Great food! Seafood Mac n Cheese! Get it.. U believable! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was in town for work and several people that I worked with spoke very highly of this place. One of the people was a little weird, so maybe I should have researched on Yelp a little bit better first. Eh, you live and learn - and isn't every experience worth trying to learn from? Anyway, this is a small, local chain. Totally gets my vote there. They make their own beer? Even better, sign me up!   We pull up, and the place is very unassuming from the outside. There is a small amount of parking beside the restaurant, but most is across the street (the street wasn't very busy on the night we went, if it matters at all). The tables and chairs feel much more suited for Country Kitchen or Cracker Barrel than a beer joint - this doesn't really bother me but recently I've read an immense amount of reviews that base a good portion of their rating on chair and how comfortable they are. If you are one of those people for whom an average chair will ruin your dining experience, please stop this review now and do not go to Rivertown Pour House. If you are okay with average wood chairs, this place is worth a shot.  Was this the best dining experience of my life? Nope. But that's okay. Was this place perfectly acceptable? Yep, but I don't think I would go out of my way to go back if I were in town.  Our waitress seemed incredibly annoyed by everything, and wanted to just leave. That's fine, I wasn't there to be her friend. The beer that I had was very good. They do some very nice dark beers. I also like that when we went they had two different sampler options (6 or 7 beers if I remember correctly). I didn't pick either of those. The Scottish Ale (is really great. I would go out of my way for this one, but it would never make my top ten if that makes sense. The cherry flavored beer my husband had in his sampler was terrifying. I didn't even take a sip after one smell. No way. the beer is where the place got the stars.  The food was incredibly blah. And I'm being nice. It wasn't terrible. I ate it, but had no need to take it back to my hotel (which had a kitchen and microwave) or finish it. It wasn't bad mind you, just not good. The spinach dip appetizer was probably half eaten. the bread that came with it was not warm and incredibly greasy. I would have told our waitress, but for 10 minutes any time I tried to get her attention she was immersed in not looking at me. The dip itself should be called Cream Cheese with some spinach and Parmesan cheese. Not flavorful at all. TGIFriday's frozen dip is better, so there is no need at all for this dish to still be on the menu if the random frozen dip is significantly better. I had higher hopes for the fish and chips (not usually my favorite, but sometimes you get a hankering). Again, meh. I was really hungry and it fit the bill. The fries were also meh.  We have a local chain near me (the Winking Lizard, should you want to visit Ohio) that does not make its own beer. At least they don't yet. However, they have an incredibly extensive beer menu that will satisfy anyone - and they also carry your standard crap beer (i.e. Bud, Miller, etc) should you hate your taste buds. Their menu is fantastic and the food is very good. Anyway, I had higher hopes is what I'm saying. Maybe I was there on an off night. Maybe I ordered the items that aren't that great (everyone I talked to seemed to like the pizzas, but I was not in a pizza mood at all). The menu has plenty of sandwiches, some burgers, and pizza.   Go here for the beer. The IPA, Scottish Ale, and Porter are worth a stop in, just grab food at home or elsewhere."}
{"text":"I used to avoid the food here unless I was desperate for basic bar food to go with good beer. Just discovered the new menu and may have found our new favorite local  pizza. The dough (slightly sweet) is awesome and was cooked perfectly. The honey BBQ chicken pizza was unique (in a good way!) and full of flavor with great grilled chicken (real chicken!) -- the crispy onions were perfect on top. I'm looking forward to going back to try the other new menu items."}
{"text":"For the price they charge this pizza is absurd. Why are the toppings only in the middle??? To their credit if dining there the jalapeño bites are awesome. Take out pizza, never again!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at Rivertowne Pour House many times. The food is always delicious!  I am writing today to say that I highly recommend Rivertowne for your private party, shower or banquet!!  The food on the various catering menus is just as delicious as what we have eaten in the restaurant.  Portions are plentiful and served hot.  Equally important was the amazing staff that assisted us before and during our event. We held a graduation party for my son at Rivertowne this past Friday night.  Gina coordinated our party prior to the event; she was knowledgeable, patient and kind.  Randy coordinated our event during dinner. She could not have been more friendly, helpful and attentive.  My family wants to adopt her!!  Good food, great staff and reasonable prices - why would you have your special event anywhere else?"}
{"text":"Not bad, but the food could be punched up a little. Our mussels needed a lot more broth, and a lot of them came out unopened, which means they were either undercooked or dead. I added avocado to a turkey burger for a dollar and they put a couple slices of rubbery and unripe stuff on it that was inedible. If they didn't have ripe avocado, they could have just told me and I would have been fine leaving it off. But my burger itself was good. Beer list is great."}
{"text":"Beer was delicious and they have paddles with samplers that are very tasty and well planned.  They have plenty of TVs to catch the game with a very clean and cozy decor.   The biggest compliment is their pierogi pizza. I would say it's the best I have had because they actually put onion and sauerkraut instead of just potato in addition to cheddar cheese. It was amazing. A stop here for that pizza is worth it alone.   Service was sufficient but the prices are a little high given the location. However as a microbrew, I don't mind supporting this great brewery.   A must stop for a visit in Monroeville."}
{"text":"I love Rivertowne's Jumbo Wings. Some of the best in the city. They are consistent throughout their several locations. I will say that this one has the best service. Mia was absolutely great!!! She was attentive, knowledgable and made our experience delightful. Decor is very dated, but does kinda work for the clientele. Will go to this one from now on."}
{"text":"I was there with a party of about 22 people and Sherry was an awesome waitress.  She handled the entire table on her own and I was very impressed.  I had a Western Burger that was pretty tasty.  It could have had a little bit more BBQ sauce - but overall it was good.  My rum and coke tasted great, too.  You might not think a rum and coke could taste bad, but it definitely can!  Parking in convenient - there is a parking lot across the street."}
{"text":"I have tried their beer at a festival and really enjoyed it. I have been wanting to try the restaurant for some time after hearing it was really Good! I finally got to go with my sister. We both absolutely loved the food! I got the pineapple beer, which is great fresh! We ordered scotch eggs, the seafood Mac and cheese, and the catfish bucket. That was the first time she tried scotch eggs and loved them! Not only was the food amazing, our waitress was phenomenal! She was super attentive, friendly, and totally easy going. One of my top favs! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Food is just how it should be their brewer is top notch, some of the best beer in Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"Really good in house beers.  Although we came here for a pool table and there isn't one (fail on the yelp search) decided to stay since they brewed their own brews!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with the family and TJ and Alyssa (Alice) were awesome. They were friendly and accommodated our whole party. We all came into town for a funeral and came to the brew house last minute but they were friendly and happy to serve us. I definitely recommend this place if you're a regular or if you're in town for any family event. Thanks again guys !"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was fun. I had the catfish and even though it says Cajun seasoning it gives off more of a smokey flavor than a hot/spicy flavor. (They offer Creole mayo or tartar sauce with the catfish...I ordered a butter/garlic dip instead and they made it for me!)  The fries that came with it were fresh cut and went great with malt vinegar!  Extra kudos for serving the \"bucket meal\" in an actual bucket!  It was delicious! I also had a Pear Cider to go with it- yum!"}
{"text":"Wow what great appetizers they had here and at half price I couldn't pass these up. We both enjoyed there beer specials that were seasonal as well as your usual domestics.   I ordered this mushroom and cheese appetizer that literally tasted like pizza without the crust. It was so delicious. I'm not sure if they drinking played a role in my decision but hey my taste buds don't lie. My friend ordered the bacon and cheese covered fries. They were good too but anything with bacon and cheese is good right?  I opted out of the beer specials seeing that we had just come from another bar and only cam here to eat. There was a nice little crowd for a Monday night around midnight. All the specials were good until midnight so we had just managed to get them in. I believe the beer specials were al half off if they were $8 and under. !6oz drafts too which is way better than 12oz.  The place had a nice atmosphere that looked better than a dive bar but it wasn't anything too fancy. It was a relaxing place that I would go for lunch or dinner with some friends. It's non-smoking which made it even better cause the bar we were at prior to here left me smelling like an ashtray. UGH!!  Come visit this little place. The location is to find just off the main rd headed towards Boyce Campus. Try to get there for the specials!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Mussels in garlic and beer sauce was awesome as was the Arctic Amber. Staff was friendly and my only regret is not having the time to try more of the beer selection while I was in town."}
{"text":"I guess I have been out of the \"Burg\" for a while as I have forgotten just how big all the portions are here.  Wow, you get value in this city!!   Atmosphere - Microbrew Pub, local chain bar, how about local chain microbrew pub!, Steelers, Pens, dim lighting, tables, black pleather seats, bar stools.  Food - This was my first meal back in the Burg.  The menu had so many good choices, as I am just happy to see toasted hoagies/ sandwiches again!  I ordered the Jones St...half.  It was basically a large half a cheese steak hoagie that comes w/ fresh cut fries.  It was much larger than I expected and was very reasonably priced.  Oh, and I also had a few of their monster sized wings.  These things were very tasty and came from mutant sized birds.  Oooo, one last thing...they make their own cream soda too.  It was extremely tasty...okay, maybe not extreme...but it was a nice change of pace from my normal ice tea choice.  I know, what about the beer???  Well, it was lunchtime.  So there was no beer sampling on this visit.  I will definitely try it out on my next trip there, which I hope is soon.          Service - Friendly, cute and quick.    Price - Total before tip $6.95 for the cheese steak & fries.  Sweet!!  Overall - Other than the difficult to remember name, RiverTowne Pour House in the Municipality of Monroeville...I will definitely stop by again and try that delicious looking sandwich...The Pacino."}
{"text":"As you all should have seen in my recent post, the upcoming TRASH XIX Homebrew Competition is to be judged at the Rivertowne Pour House--a brewpub out in Monroeville. I'm helping to organize that event, but I've actually never been to Rivertowne. Wanting to correct that situation, I invited a friend of mine out last Sunday for lunch. Read on for my take on the place.  The Rivertowne Pour House is a fairly recent addition to the Pittsburgh beer scene--having opened just two years back. Stationed on the far Eastern side of Monroeville, it's the third restaurant of three similarly branded establishments owned and operated by Christian Fyke. The others have been around for a little while: one in Penn Hills and the other about 8 miles south in Huntington. The Pour House is the only brewpub of the mix, with brewing overseen by head brewer Andrew Maxwell--formerly of the John Harvard's that was once stationed on the other side of Monroeville.  more at... http://www.foodburgh.com/2009/06/rivertowne-pour-house/"}
{"text":"I don't have much to stay other than the Rueben I ordered was dry and the rye was as hard as a rock. The cream soda was amazing though...although I wish I couldve found it on the menu somewhere because nobody told me there weren't free refills until my 3rd one!!!"}
{"text":"So glad I stopped in here! We had a large party of 14 people and one baby, and they quickly and courteously accommodated us.    I tried the deep fried pretzels that were stuffed with jalapeño and cheese, and it was probably one of the best things I have ever eaten! Sooo delicious!  Also, you have to try the rivertowne Hala Khahiki pineapple beer.  So refreshing and tasty!"}
{"text":"This place needs a big sign. The parking lot is actually across a street without a crosswalk and has a huge sign that just says PARKING but no actual indication that this was Rivertowne Pour House. I assumed since my gps said I arrived, but honestly, it could have been any nondescript, beige building.   The huge tankards of beer in the main dining room was cool to look at but the design of the restaurant was pretty bad. There were several levels, several rooms but none of the open space roominess that the website pictures seemed to display.  Food was pretty greasy and mediocre. I ordered the ginger grilled mahimahi and it really was just okay. The fish portion was pretty tiny and the waiter should have warned me that all their salads come with a bunch of onion straws on top randomly. I would've not gotten the additional onion straws as sides then. My meal came with one piece of cornbread muffin but no accompanying sauce.   The waiter was nice but pretty forgetful. It was quiet on a Tuesday night, which is great because I chose this place to meet up with a friend. We spent 2 hours talking so the laid back atmosphere was conducive to that. But overall, I have no desire to come back."}
{"text":"Great food, beer and service!!  Gina and the rest of staff are always so nice and provide great service!!!"}
{"text":"Service was a bit inattentive, but very friendly when they eventually came by.  The  brew was excellent.   The waitress talked me into an appetizer of \"hardboiled eggs wrapped in sausage and deep fried - with a side of hot sauce\" I felt like I was defying death with every bite. An angioplasty should be required with every order. No doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"We loved this place. Stopped there after a Pirate game and the food was great. I ordered the Scottish eggs and quesadilla as recommended on here. Both were very good. We all tried each other's stuff, lol. The wings were crispy, the tater tots yummy and the vege wrap tasty!  The guys loved their beers too. We will go back soon!"}
{"text":"Totally not seeing the love of this place. Mr. J and I had lunch here last Saturday and wasn't expecting to be totally bowled over, but was hoping it was better than it turned out.   The beer menu is extensive, however, when I ordered the Pineapple beer, I was told it wasn't tapped yet and the cranberry beer was suggested. It tasted really watered down and wasn't anything special. Mr. J also commented that the red ale was just \"ok\".   I had ordered the cajun catfish bucket - which was a plank of spicy, fried catfish with a bucket of hand-cut fries. I took 3 bites of the fish and tried to hide my disgust but failed miserably when Mr. J asked what was wrong. The fish was so fishy that I had a hard time swallowing it. I didn't say anything and just ate my fries. The waitress was kind enough to take my meal off of the bill.   Mr. J ordered wings. Since I couldn't finish my meal, I had one. I couldn't eat it either. To me it seemed undercooked. The skin was still rubbery and slimy. I like my wings crispy!   Afterwards, Mr. J commented that at least he knows he never has to go back. I agreed."}
{"text":"Three words: strawberry shortcake beer. I was literally blown away by how delicious this beer was, and every other beer we sampled here!  I didn't think much of RiverTowne when we sat down--it's not exactly the cleanest/classiest/coolest looking place, but the service, beer selection, food (good pub grub!), and price elevated this place to somewhere we MUST go to everytime we're in the Burgh. It's a GEM! Just don't get hit when crossing the street from the parking lot--seriously, that &!^ is dangerous!"}
{"text":"The polish chili dog and the reuben were good. The french fries were very good. The service was excellent. I would suggest they fire the kitchen staff responsible for making the cole slaw - unless you like shredded cabbage swimming in mayonnaise. Overall, the food was just OK in my view."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a coworker tonight. Am traveling here on business. Sat at the bar. Excellent draft beer (Wylie's IPA) and a great burger and fries for a quick dinner!"}
{"text":"Beer is good ... Everything else is disappointing feels more like neighborhood  bar instead of microbrewery .. Still stuck at 80's concept"}
{"text":"I've been to the RiverTowne Pour House a few times and its been good everytime.  Nothing has been completely outstanding, but everything has reached par at least.  They have 'handcrafted brews' on tap, and the servers have been very educated on what to suggest based on the type of beer you prefer.  The brews are also quite tasty.  They have sort of a separated section for the bar, and another for the dining area, and I would assume this place gets pretty rowdy when a sports game is on.  The chairs are very unique in that they look hand crafted from knotty wood, which is a nice touch, but not truly needed.  The food is good, but still, nothing great or truly mindblowing.  The weekend buffet offers some different choices (including scotch eggs when I was there) as well as some dinner items (like fish) - so it gibes you a chance to get something else if you're really not in the mood for bagels or eggs and typical breakfast/brunch food.  The sandwiches are good, and filling with a good amount of sides.  This is a good family restaurant (still wouldn't go on a game night) with good service.  But I'm sticking to 4 stars because as you can tell, it gets a 'good' rating, but nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"Excellent comfort food. I've never gotten something here I didn't enjoy! It's a little bit more secluded so there is usually room."}
{"text":"We had my goddaughters baptism luncheon here today and everything was really great! They had a nice room in the back of the restaurant for our party and everything was very well organized. The staff did a great job getting everyone's orders out quickly which was impressive considering we had about 20 people at the party and the food was delicious. I got the grilled chicken salad and my boyfriend got the pastrami sandwich with fries. My salad was delicious, and I managed to snag a bite of his sandwich and it was really good too. I love trying new places and this is one I would definitely go back to."}
{"text":"RiverTowne Pourhouse is my favorite go-to place for beers and late-night get-togethers. They make all of their own brews, and they have a seasonal beer menu. I would name some of my favorites, but there are too many.   There is a choice for every beer lover: the Crandel-El and the Strawberry-Shortcake-less for you fruity beer lovers, and the White Lightning is a MUST for those who like Belgians. As of summer 2010, their standards are now bottled and sent to six-pack shops.  As for the food, the menu is extensive and the quality is decent. They have everything from mussels to burgers to pizzas. The price isn't bad, either.   Every night from ten to twelve, RPH has a happy hour where beers are only $3, and appetizers are half off. It's really a great deal! My friends love that EVERY DAY the place is open until 2am, and the kitchen is open until 1am. Team Trivia is every monday starting at 8, and Name that Tune is every Thursday. If you're ever looking for activities during the weekdays... this is the place to go.   Overall, I don't have any negatives about RPH save that their waitstaff can be slightly slow."}
{"text":"Rivertown is a brew pub that is a little underwhelming in my opinion. They have a couple locations some more impressive an others but over all I feel their beers are just okay. Their food is average, I have had one of their hambergers and it was just middle of the road type of fair.   I don't really have any complaints and perhaps I need to give it another go. So perhaps I will try again and report back, but for now 3 stars is where I'm leaving it."}
