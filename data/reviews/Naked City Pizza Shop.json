{"text":"Awesome food. Dessert was best cannoli I've tasted in the States. Service rocks, super laid back and friendly."}
{"text":"My second time coming here. The food is a must in Vegas!  Last time I came here the wait was a little long and service was so so, but the food by far made up for it. This time device has been great, also!!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband saw this restaurant and dinner drive and dives in the foot network channel. And i said to myself next time we go to Vegas were going to check this place out so we did the pizza was awesome the suicide fries were too die for the service was awesome the people were so friendly I recommend this restaurant to everyone if your ever in Vegas you need to go to this place it's the bomb......"}
{"text":"My time these days doesn't really allow for writing many Yelp reviews anymore, but I had to chime in with a four star review for a solid Las Vegas spot.  Unfortunately it seems that anytime Fieri stops by, the idiot reviewers come out of the woodwork. That's really the case here on Yelp, so let's clarify some things:  1) Yes, the restaurant is in Moondoggies, a bit of a dive bar.  That's mentioned ahead of time in all the press, so you're lame if you're going to ding them a star because you had to get a babysitter or you didn't like the vibe. The rest of us enjoy the booze, the Bills (not really, but you get the point) and the surroundings.  2) Yes, the suicide sauce (and fries, I assume) are spicy! I'm not really sure how one would think otherwise. Go to Tex Wasabis if you wan't faux tasting food.   3) Yes, this place is serving up a Buffalo-style pie. It boggles the mind how people just come in and say \"not very good pizza\" without more because they have no respect for the different types of pizzas one can get.  Alright, now that's all out of the way, so what'd we get that made me rant and rave so happily?  Stinger pizza - Absolutely delicious. One problem with Vegas eateries is that places often try to be trendy by throwing gut-busting ingredients into a dish without any conception for how they go together or how they leave you feeling. The buffalo chicken, steak, peppers and cheese on this dish seem like they'd have that problem (and might, if you eat the whole pie) but a slice on its own has an awesome flavor profile.  Royal sandwich - Simple, tasty and done right. Makes me miss their sandwich shop back when it was downtown.   If you like great food and know you're okay with a certain vibe, go...you won't regret it. If you don't, that's fine too...but don't write an unfair review of a place as a result."}
{"text":"I ate here with a friend and tried the suicide fries. They were hot, but delish!! We loved the atmosphere of the bar, and the bartender was hilarious."}
{"text":"Good food, crappy service.  Been here before,  but the service tonight was unacceptable.  We ordered a pizza,  fries and waters.  Had to wait long after our glasses were Empy for refils, and after we finished eating,  we waited over 30 minutes for our server to check in and see if everything was okay. At that point we simply wanted to leave and asked for a box and our check,  but we ended up waiting an extra 15 minutes for that. the place was not packed by any means.  The only positive was green olives on the pizza....."}
{"text":"This is where you go for pizza in Vegas. Only go somewhere else if you want to punish yourself for being bad. If for some reason you don't feel like pizza you will find the other food there to be top notch and sometimes a little scary because you would not expect the kind of quality and taste you get from here in a kitchen attached to a bar. Look out for the cute bartender, she'll steal your heart!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had. Although initially put off by the look of it on the outside, the atmosphere is cool and laid back and the staff is friendly.   It's out of the way if you want to get away from the strip and it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"The Best. I order frequently and the quality and service is consistently excellent"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, great pizza, for a dive bar.  I mean that in a good way.  This is the kind of place I wish we had in Stafford(We have dive bars with shitty food).  The bar and the restaurant are two separate entities and we received two separate bills, but who cares because everything was great.  A nice escape from the pretentious crap on the strip.  The pizza was the opposite of normal cookie cutter pizza with routine ingredients, and that is a wonderful thing."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot.  Great place for drinks and great food.  They make some very good specialty pizzas.  I will say I am a little disappointed they stopped making their Italian sausage (as featured on dine in , drive ins, and dives for the Guinie Pie)  and now use a cheaper substitute that is certainly not made in house.  My last Guinie Pie also had a lot less spinach and feta cheese then it had in the past.  :("}
{"text":"Birthday dinner!  Poutine Fries and Suicide Fries, \"Fricken Huge\" is a lot of food and a great price.  Pizza was pretty awesome too, the cheese was real and the sauce was very tasty.  Because my son was 18 we couldn't eat in the bar but we had excellent service next door at Desnudo Tacos."}
{"text":"My co-worker wanted to try this place after seeing it on some Food Network show; she came back with this huge pizza that had lots of cheese, huge slices of sausage, spinach and ricotta cheese. I have to say it was a pretty good pizza, it would have been AMAZING if it had some garlic added to the sauce. And the corners seem a little neglected from the sausage. But overall I am very happy & satisfied and would definitely try their food again! My mom used to go to Moon Doggies all the time for the drinks/gaming, I'll continue the tradition but instead of gaming it will be to eat!! Can't wait to try the fries, sandwiches, etc... And if they have Italian desserts then they'll never be rid of me!"}
{"text":"Now this is a sandwich! They roast all of their meats in house, they also make all of the sides and their own pickles, which are incredible. Everything on the menu is great, but my favorite is the tri-tip sandwich. The tri-tip is perfectly seasoned, roasted to perfection and is best piled high on a kimmelwick bun. The tomato bisque soup is liquid crack. They have all of the usual toppings as well as a great garlic mayo and a killer green chili mustard.  The food is fantastic as is the staff."}
{"text":"If you don't mind the smell of smoke, you won't regret this place.  The service is slow  and not the friendliest but the food is very good.   We had the\"back home\" (?) Pizza with traditional wings. Both were very good.    Next time I'm in Vegas, I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"We went to Naked City Pizza after seeing it on Diners Drive Inns and Dives. This location of Naked City Pizza is in a DIVE bar called Moondoggies. We had the stuffed mushrooms made with home made sausage and the Guinea pie! Both were absolutely delicious! What made the experience even better was our server Katie! She was so sweet and helpful even as she was serving, cooking, AND doing dishes! Katie was the bomb diggity and so was the food!"}
{"text":"Overrated pizza. Just bc its on ddd doesn't mean it's the best thing on earth. Honestly had a cheese pizza and the cheese straight fell of the whole slice. How on earth can u mess up a cheese pizza. I could only imagine what would happen if u you got a pie with topping it would probably be a complete disaster. Look u want good pizza go to joes ny pizza, secret pizza. Or especially grimaldis if haven't been to the one in Brooklyn it's close to it but not the same. Look anyways if the owners are reading this get it together and make true pizza that falls apart."}
{"text":"Following the advice of Guy Fieri on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives, during  my recent travels to Las Vegas this past weekend we decided to try out Naked City Pizza Shop in Las Vegas, NV.     To my astonishment the customer service was subpar, and both the staff and environment seemed a bit culturally bias.  The Guinea's Pie was amazing!!! Though I prayed and hoped that my food wasn't tampered with during my visit.  However, I've never been in a restaurant establishment in this millennium, where I was treated like a \"colored\" person in the south during the Civil Right era in the 1960's, not only was I treated like an outcast due to my skin color/orientation, but racist paraphernalia befouling our nation's president laced the walls of the establishment.    At this point I'm unsure as a consumer if I should trust the Food Networks, Diners, Drive-In's and Dives television show or suggest that other foodies partake in visiting establishments featured on the show if the quality of service and environment is such as Naked City Pizza Shop.    Dine at your own risks!!"}
{"text":"Went there twice in the past week, and ordered chicken wings. The wings were so small that I thought they were pigeon wings. C'mon... This guy is from buffalo, he knows that if he were to serve tiny chicken wing in Buffalo, we would have thrown it back at him (not literally). The flavor was there, its just that the size was a serious disappoinment. I think if he would have added extra wings to make up for the size I wouldn't be writing this..... PLEASE GET SOME NORMAL SIZE WINGS! or change your prices to reflect! We had 50 wings between 2 adults and 2 children. We ate the all and wanted more! When we go to your competitor, we usually have leftovers! Please make a change, because I dont want to go anywhere else. I like you r restaurant."}
{"text":"Pizza is my favorite food and I could eat it everyday. That being said, naked city is the best pizza I have found in Vegas. I have lived here almost a year, tried 15 different places and naked city it the best. The Guinea pie is perfection and I have had the stinger and the naked city as well. All of them were delicious but the Guinea pie was the best.  For appetizers, the suicide fries are only for the brave of heart. I love them but my boyfriend would not even try them. They are hot! The garlic buns are like cinnamon rolls but with no cinnamon and add garlic and cheese...aka awesome.  Finally the location, I personally love that this place in in a dive bar! It a not that scary like other reviews have said. I thought it was awesome. The service is ok. I have had great service and ok service but the food is worth any experience.   So if you have kids, don't come to this location but if you do not have children naked city pizza is the best pizza vegas has to offer."}
{"text":"My husband is in the military so we move around a lot. I'm originally from Buffalo, NY (home of awesome hockey and football and amazing wings!) and it's so hard to find pizza and wings that are actually good outside of the Buffalo area! There's NY style pizza, Chicago style pizza, real Italian pizza and then somewhere in the middle is Buffalo style pizza. Bubbly doughy crust, sauce that's not to acidic and not too sweet, the perfect ammount of nice molten cheese and little pepperonis that curl up and get nice and crispy. You can't get it outside of Buffalo unless you are from the 716, move and then open a shop. And that's exactly what happened! Saw this place on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives after just moving to Vegas and I hightailed it to this dive bar with the best pizza and wings west of Buffalo. It's really the ONLY place to get good wings. And probably the only place outside of Buffalo you can get a chicken finger sub (which is the best of both worlds!)! They have Loganberry (a HUGE hit with me!) and make inhouse blue cheese sauce. As long as we are stationed here, I will be going there for my pizza! ONLY complaint is that they don't have Costanzo's rolls :("}
{"text":"Food was really good!  Pizza was delicious.  Suicide Fries were great, not for the soft pallet for sure. Bar feel with good range of drinks.  Mostly a whiskey bar and not with cocktails."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last week.  Everything was great.  We ordered traditional,  Sicilian and Suicide wings.  All were great but suicide are my favorite.  Love that they are served with blue cheese not ranch. The suicide wings are super hot, just the way I like my wings.  The traditional are great and the Sicilian were a great non-traditional wing ( parmesan cheese and garlic).  We also ordered a pizza with pepperoni,  and hot peppers.   This pizza had a great assortment of peppers and great flavors.   I love hot and spicy food and Naked City doesn't disappoint.  Please note separate checks for food and the beer we ordered.   No issue for me, just a note so no one is surprised."}
{"text":"******DO NOT GO EAT TO THIS PLACE **** First of all I want to say  their customer service just sucks they are completely rude their wings are disgusting do not order that ever anyways I got my pizza and as I'm taking a bite on my slice of pizza I'm biting until this long piece of long black hair it was so disgusting I wouldn't recommend this place to nobody the place look like a dump it does not look sanitize is just very disgusting I really thought it was going to be like a little hole in the wall where there  where their food is going to be amazing but no it was disgusting I would never go there in my whole entire life I don't recommend it to no one."}
{"text":"dont be afraid of the location of dive bar , bartenders were very freindly , clean bathroom and the pizza was very good."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice now. It is tucked away in a bar called Moondoggies on the corner of Desert Inn and Arville. Once you enter, there is a small window where you place your order. I ordered the first pizza on the specialty pies list, called The Stinger. Each bite was a different combination of delicious flavors, from the crispy chicken tenders, spicy peppers, melted cheese, and fresh, piping-hot steak. Needless to say, I dream about this pizza when we're not together. The sides are great and perfect for both a pizza restaurant and a bar. Had the poutine fries, and if you've never had them, they are as weirdly delicious as you think they'd be.  Service is standard. I've never had a bad experience, and though its never been exceptional either, I don't mind it. You really don't get attentive service here, but remember, you just ordered this pizza from a small window inside a bar on Arville. The product is the star here, and they have something beautiful.  Final thoughts: Not many restaurants take the risks this place does. I mean, who puts steak AND chicken tenders on a pizza? But that's exactly what makes this place one of a kind. It is a must try."}
{"text":"Boo not kid friendly. Saw this on food network and on diner dives...wanted to try it. I guess My family and I won't be trying their lovely pizza. Also that place looks ratched anyways. They need to build a place so we can come here geez there are tons of places for adults y deprive us of the awesome pizza so disappointed."}
{"text":"We made an order for a pizza with suicide fries. We ordered it online. We waited 20 minutes before driving so when we got there we would expect to only wait about 10 more minutes or so. When we got there they said they just were starting the order. I asked how long it would take. The lady said she did not know since they just ran out of cheese... We told them to cancel it and left"}
{"text":"Great pizza. We tried The Back Home with the garlic crust so soft and delicious. Suicide fries lived up to their name. Hot wings meaty and crisp. Cold draft beer. Relaxed atmosphere, great music. I'd recommend for some late night quality drunk food."}
{"text":"I placed a 60 dollar order and left 10 bucks for the delivery driver via the online ordering system. I received a call about 15 minutes later saying that they don't deliver to the strip. This place is literally a mile and a half away from my hotel.   It's sad that a \"Buffalo\" bar would turn down a big order from a former buffalonian (which they could tell from my 716 area code). What a shame."}
{"text":"Best East Coast pizza this side of the Mississippi! Even though our order is a tad complicated, they always get it right. We appreciate that they have Raspberry Cider and the garlic knots are an excellent excuse for warding off unwanted male suitors."}
{"text":"Standard bar pizza - not much more.  Not sure why Guy Fieri made such a big deal about this place. Smoking is permitted in the bar."}
{"text":"The pizza is so good and so cheap. It is greasy but in the best possible way. If you eat it after a night out, you will not have a hangover. I got a sandwich of some kind instead one time and that was a mistake. Just get the pizza."}
{"text":"Great food....but, just hope for at least one male working in the kitchen. If it's two girls, your order could take up to at least an hour before it ready. 2 girls=run. 1guy 1girl=order up"}
{"text":"So bummed, went again and though my order was identical it was disappointing. Why does everything in Vegas that's so good always change so abruptly? Sandwich was 4 or 5\" shorter and served to go in Styrofoam so sogginess was going to be an issue. I may try again but not in a hurry to like last visit. Kinda sad."}
{"text":"Big fan of the food, especially their Suicide Fries! Those bad boys are hot hot hot. I enjoy that it's located inside of one of my favorite dive bars in town. Their bartenders Artie and James are by far their standouts. Both are very friendly, attentive and make you feel right at home."}
{"text":"After hearing about naked city pizza from some friends and reading the reviews I thought I'd try it for the first time. I had great expectations. I was disappointed. I ordered a cheese pizza. The crust was cooked well. That's really all I can say that's good about it. The pizza had no taste. While eating it it reminded me of a frozen pizza and that's not saying much. There are many other pizza places in the area and I'm going to try those. This will be my last time at Naked City Pizza"}
{"text":"We came starving and the service is REALLY slow even though our friend was known by the server because she's somewhat of a regular. Super divey bar, no need to dress up...or wear clean clothes."}
{"text":"This is about the new location on Paradise.  I ordered on the phone for takeout, the half pizza with peperoni on half and garlic buns.  She read my order back, told her it would be 20 mins.  When we got there, the cook did a 1/4 size pizza not the 1/2, the girl looked on the order and it did say 1/2.  So, they asked if we wanted the other 1/2.  Yes, we had to wait 10 mins , they did not say they were sorry, they did not comp us for their mistake.  Then when we got the pizza home, it was wrong.  The peperoni was on all the pizza and the pizza was burnt.  Very disappointed!  Not sure when we will be back to eat here again soon.   Also, the cook in the kitchen was slamming things down and looked very unhappy!"}
{"text":"This is one of those dive bars that is a must, slots at the bar and a hole in the wall to order some of the best pizza I have ever had and the salad was top notch as well. All of the food that I saw come out of that hole in the wall looked good. Hope James is working when you go, he was the man!!!"}
{"text":"This pizza is AMAZING and the chicken wings are crunchy and juicy!!!  Heard about NCP on Diners, Drive-Ins, Dives and had to go.  Its' in a bar called Moon Doggies well off the strip.  A funky little bar with a little pizza order window.  Absolutely delicious - can't say enough about it.  The bar/pizza staff were very friendly and we had a great time there.  Well worth the trip - don't be put off by the parking lot - its really not a used car lot :)  A place to make time for ... for sure."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night the wings were dry and the pizza was nothing special. They forgot to make my pizza and had to ask the bartender twice for my drink he was to busy doing shots."}
{"text":"I love this place. Im from so cal so when we get to vegas we have to get naked city fix. The pizza here is amazing. Im a fan of dive bars so the fact that its located inside moon doggies is awesome. We ordered the steak and cheese and it was great. It was cover with steak, cheese, and peppers. One of best pizzas I have ever eaten. If you want great pizza in the vegas area you have to eat here."}
{"text":"Ordered a massive pizza, sheet pan size. It was a deluxe type with all the typical toppings on it.  it was very good.  The group loved it.  If you need pizza for a group, this is the place for you.  Nice and spicy. About $30.  The cook was very friendly and conscious of his work, which is always good."}
{"text":"Look! It's a pawn shop.. it's a tattoo parlor.. Nope, nope- it's a Dive Bar- that happens to serve delicious pizza. So, if you have seen Diners, Drive- Ins and Dives then you've heard of this Dives mythical existence.  If you blink you will miss this pizza bar as it is disguised as a plethora of places that have nothing to do with pizza. There is a 2nd hurdle being the point of entrance hidden as something of a speakeasy. Being the adamant foodie extraordinaire that I am, I defeated the resistance & entered the dark, smokey cave.   Rapid fire 1st impression: - A dozen compressed bar stool cushions beneath the cheeks of replicated \"Norm's\" & \"Woody's\". - Bartender smoking a cig. (no extra charge) - Red solo cups for anything N/A. - Food orders are placed thru a small window reminiscent of a roach coach. - Nobody other than fellow treasure hunters acknowledge your existence.  - Sanitation? Questionable.  With all that said, the pizza was worthy of reoccurring business & the garlic fries were average. Spoken camaraderie with fellow dining patrons made this experience all the better. Put this place on the list of \"must eats\". Not for the thin skinned."}
{"text":"The pizza here is always good nice and hot. It's a little small inside but it's cool because it gives you that new York pizzeria feeling. I always recommend this place when someone is looking for good pizza. It can be hard to spot when your heading down Paradise because it's a small location but just keep a look out for it when you past Harmon street and the hard Rock Cafe if your driving south on paradise."}
{"text":"I cannot express how awesome this food is! The owner Chris is extremally friendly and attentive to details and you can tell there is a lot of pride in their food! DO NOT MISS the Buffalo Chicken Dip on the app menu. I wanted to lick the bowl! Also- if the special that week/day is the homemade pretzels.... order 2 or 3 orders. He makes Auntie Anne's pretzels look foolish :) Yes- its in a dive bar....but thats part of the appeal. Just go with it and enjoy the experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I heard they had poutine here, and I had to check it out for myself. Moon Doggies has a great atmosphere and good energy. I ordered the poutine to go, and they were clever, keeping the gravy separate from the fries and cheese, so the fries wouldn't get soggy as I drove home.  Now, the only downside I can give is that they used shredded mozzarella cheese, instead of cheese curds, so when I dumped the gravy, the cheese became one big layer of melted cheese, instead of mixing with the fries as it's meant to happen.  So, be sure to mix the cheese with the fries before you dump the gravy on, or just eat there and let them do it for you...either way, the fries are good, and the gravy is salty, which is how I generally like it. But, mixed with the mozz (which is salty, as well) it can be a little over-powering. So, be prepared for that possibility.  Would I go back? Definitely. It's too good to let a few small issues keep me away."}
{"text":"Anyone who likes this pizza truly knows nothing about pizza. Awful still in a dingy dive bar. Triple D is usually on the mark but not in this instance."}
{"text":"The food is great.  At least the Guinea Pie and the fries.    Unfortunately, we didn't knew the kitchen is also a Pub and minors are not allowed.  To solve that, the restaurant has a place next to the main restaurant but there are no connecting door between the two real states.  This makes the one attendant to be running back and forward from the main Pub to the family restaurant making the service slow and some times you feel as abandoned.   So adults, if want enjoy a beer with your pizza and/or are with your family better think in order to go."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would. This place deserves like -5 stars. Customer service is TERRIBLE. Took an hour for a single pizza that we were taking out. Didn't tip the cook because frankly why should I tip him to do his job. He doesn't have to wait on me or go out of his way in any form. I order a pizza for take out, from the little window inside a dive bar, all he has to do is make it. You know, his job. So, the whole time we were there waiting, and waiting some more, he's bringing out other customers food that were dining in EVEN THOUGH I ordered my pizza before they even walked into the establishment. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Never again will I step foot into this place. It is a shame. The whole experience was a blatant disregard of customer service. I don't mind taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"the best pizza i've ever had...ever. atmosphere might not be for everyone but if you want the best pizza crust you've ever had this is the place."}
{"text":"This place is a true dive, but if you can get decent service its worth the effort! We arrived and stood in the doorway for several minutes, the place was busy, but mostly at the bar! We were finally seated, our waitress, was abviously busy, acted as tho we were more of a hindrance than customers, but we had a TV with a good college basketball game on so we didn't let the sloooow service keep us from bailing out! The food was very tasty, greasy pizza, a large pan of garlic fries and soda pop! The portions are very large, the prices not exorbitant and the place was loud! Having seen episodes on the travel channel and food network we wanted to give it a try! Overall, we would come back but only if we we not pressed for time and wanted some good greasy grub!"}
{"text":"Naked city pizza by far has the best pizza I've ever had! Their garlic knots are amazing because the more you keep eating them, the more cheesier it gets. At first it was little bit hard to find just because it's inside Moon Doggies bar; but just go inside and there will a place to order in the back corner. It's pretty dope because you get to eat some delicious pizza and drink some beer. Can't go wrong. BUT!..make sure that if you're going to this location you are 21 yrs or older because they do card you."}
{"text":"You love dive bars? You love cheap beer? You love TOP QUALITY NOSH?  You will LOVE this place.  Great bar to bring out-of-towners to; no strip-priced drinks, casual atmosphere and mind-blowing foodgasms.  It's got a super comfortable feel, as there's no dress code or VIP list to worry about, friendly bar-staff and anything you order is going to create some major-mouth-happiness.  I dig it."}
{"text":"Yes- It's in a Dive Bar (Moon Doggies), but it was Clean, Yes- Don't bring the kids (Not Allowed Under 18), Yes - they play Loud Grunge Rock type music, Yes - It's not in the Best part of town. But if any of your Yuppie tendencies keeps you from coming here it's your loss. One of The Best Pizza Joints anywhere with Fresh High Quality Ingredients at a moderate price. Think more of the village in NY than fake facade tourist trap Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We had the Back Home pizza. Good meats and lots of cheese but the crust was a little too soft for my liking (slice would sag when you picked it up).  Hot wings were juicy.  The suicide Fries are so tasty but can set your mouth of fire if you're not careful.  Music was good (Johnny Cash).   Service was ok for bar standards.   Overall it was good but far from great."}
{"text":"I had the poutine. I was a little worried about this place when saw it because it looked like a run down bar. I ordered from the side. The poutine was good and fresh. curds with gravy and fries great. 3 for the small and 5 for the large. Unless you are eating with a couple of people get the small as I eat a lot but could not finish the food."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of bars but I would have eaten here every day of our trip had my husband been agreeable. The staff was excellent and the food even better. We had medium wings and a Naked City Pizza. The food was delicious. I was super pleased. The prices ... oh my gosh - so inexpensive. I loved the place, despite the location, tho - it adds to the experience, so all in all, I wouldn't change a thing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were at the outlets downtown and wanted some quick yummy food on the way home. We'd driven by Naked City more than a few times and decided to stop in. The place smelled awesome. I had the tri-tip on kimmelweck with garlic mayo and cheddar. I've eaten a lot of sandwiches (in some great sandwich shops) in my life and this one ranks right up there. The meat is incredible, but the kimmelweck is what really won me over. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing!!!!! We looove the Naked City and Guinea Pie. Also the Philly Cheesesteak Rolls are fabulous! It's a must stop while in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on DDD and decided i had to try it the next time I was in Vegas. I sure am glad. Alright here is the breakdown...  It's a dive bar. One door in and a back door. When you walk in, the bar is on the right and there is seating on the left. It's not very big. There are only about 9 tables. I can only imaging what this place is like on the weekend or for dinner. (They do offer take out) We went at 12:15 on a Wednesday afternoon. There were only 2 tables available. Phew. The service was slow, but there was only one guy working his ass off. We weren't in a hurry, so that wasn't a problem for us. Now, on to the food/drinks....  So it's a full bar. Any drink you want, they can make it. I had a Bloody Mary and wow! They make their own mix and its great. Perfectly spicy and didn't include the usual accompanying \"salad\"... Only a lime wedge. : )  Food... I wanted pizza. I ordered two 1/4 sheet pizzas (6 square slices each). I'm only going to mention the one off the menu because it was AMAZING! The steak and cheese pizza. First off they use a white garlic sauce instead of red sauce for this pizza. (I HIGHLY recommend having this sauce over the red sauce if you make your own pizza combo. It is so tasty.) Then steak, cheese and jalapeño peppers top the pizza. Hands down the best tasting pizza I've ever had.   I'm so looking forward to going back the next time I'm in vegas. : )"}
{"text":"Wow i am shocked!!! I've been the HUGE fan of naked city inside moon doggies bar and hubby took me today for a Mother's day favorite!  Wow the server and her bus girl are absolutely horrible!! Since naked city opened a new restraunt I will be traveling there. The server stands at the bar chatting with guys and ignores all her customers.  We were never checked on. And we waved down the bus girl Cuz we had to go we needed our check. and she saw us 3 times and pretended not to see us. Hubby finally said \"hi\" and she rolled her eyes and say \"ya\" naked city in moon doggies u not only were rude you got our entire order wrong u really ruined the experience for me. I will not return .  Service was the worst I e ever had anywhere!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Awesome suicide fries. Awesome stuffed mushrooms. Awesome fried dough. Simply awesome!!"}
{"text":"I've been to naked city multiple times and it always hot and delicious. Music is great and the beer is ice cold. If you're looking for a thick crust pizza this place is the best! I suggest the GUINEA PIE!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst customer service I have experienced! Was told pizza would take 20 minutes waited 39 minutes! First time their first time ordering, person taking the order very impatient and had an attitude. Place is kinda dirty. Pizza was good but they're stingy with the ingredients mostly bread. Would not recommend or go back. There is better pizza places in Las Vegas. Owner need to redeem his name and work on customer service and be more generous with the ingredients"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pizza in Vegas. The kitchen is located inside a dive bar \"Moon Doggies\" which in itself is a really popular spot to wet your whistle and play some video poker along with the great eats.  Bring an appetite."}
{"text":"A heads up here - the Las Vegas Boulevard location is now closed, and the entire Naked City product line, sandwiches, pizza, pasta, chicken wings and all sorts of good stuff, is now found at the Naked City Pizza location, at Moon Doggies (3249 South Arville, just off of Desert Inn). The same quality ingredients, and the same quality control, is coming from the kitchen."}
{"text":"This was a fun place.  The service was excellence.  I'm glad triple d put this place on tv - it was worth it.  We give it a 4 out 5 just because the seating was tight.  We went to UNO pizza in Chicago and sat on the other side of at two seat table that was big enough for a goldfish, kind of reminded us of that...."}
{"text":"Customer service was sub par @ the DI/Arville location. The employees seemed annoyed with being there. The pizza and wings were pretty tasty, although a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Definitely pick this over the Paradise location if you can make it over here. Way better food, way better atmosphere- it's in a punk rock bar. Like another reviewer said, if you don't like that then don't go there."}
{"text":"This place has a great vegetarian sandwich. Its not the standard subway cold sub or the regular 'roasted vegetable/portobello' sandwich.   I like to get it on the kimmelweck roll (coarse salt and seeds on top) with muenster cheese. The veggie filling is a mash glob of seasoned veggies. I kind of like how the veggies are sloppy style. Very flavorful!  The tomato bisque, cold dill fingerling potatoes (when they make it with sour cream, NOT mayo), giardinaire (pickled veggies done well!) and the habanero giganto pickle are all so very good!  Looks like they opened a pizza shop as well that I have yet to try... wondering if its just as unique and good?  On a side note, just a few bar stools in the tiny front room and 2 outdoor tables... I usually do take-out."}
{"text":"This place is good, but it's really not THAT good when it comes to the food. I would say the food here is 100% overpriced. Plus, they already makes tons of money on alcohol sales, so they really should lower their food prices. Appearances on tv dont make the food taste better.   They finally opened up a family dinning section but it is closed a lot, so expect to leave when you arrive if you brought kids."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza in Vegas. the staff is great and the atmosphere is awesome. Jesse the chef has sat with me many times to make sure the food is good and just to talk. the juke box is killer."}
{"text":"Mailer flier I got said operations 11am to 11pm, yelp says 9pm. Called at 8:03pm, told me they stop delivery at 8pm. Figure it out."}
{"text":"Called in a pizza order at 8:40 and they said to pick it up in 25 to 30 minutes. We drove over to the restaurant and we were there by 9 and they were closed! Totally dark and locked up. We called them back and no one would answer. The lady that took our order did not inform us that they were not going to be making our pizza and that they would be closed. I couldn't even believe what was happening. Horrible experience and too bad because I have heard their pizza was good."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Possibly the best pizza I've had in vegas...possibly.  The pizza that I purchased (I believe it was something like the back home pizza) was just okay. One of my friends got the chicken finger pizza and it was AMAZING! Loved it! Worth a second, third, and fourth visit!   Also, the loaded potato fries were good!"}
{"text":"This dive bar was super quiet when we were there, but it was a Wednesday night at 10pm. The booths are great to enjoy a meal, although that late you have to go up and order food at the kitchen and drinks at the bar. The portions are HUGE and filling. We got the smallest size pizza and it would have been enough between two, but we wanted to try the suicide fries. Those bad boys are HOT. Super hot. Be warned."}
{"text":"I got a quarter sheet of cheese pizza... it's pretty good! The crust is thicker than average, and surrounds the edge of the rectangular sheet. The pizza is good, and the beer is cold and relatively cheap. The reason they're not getting 5 stars is because it's a bit too smokey in there, plus the edge of the crust on the pizza goes a little too far into the pizza. Give them a try if you are nearby!"}
{"text":"Came here for some late night pizza. The pizza was, as always, delicious, but the service was absolutely horrible. The bar tenders took 45 min to take our order and made us wait while they \"changed shifts\" which included them changing out the drawer and then goofing off and taking shots together. The male bartender was exceptionally rude and never even bothered to ask us if we needed a drink refill. Total of an hour and a half and we were served one beer. Waited anther 20 minutes for a to go box and to pay. They only helpful person there was the cook. I failed to mention that my friend and I were the only 2 people in the entire place. Both bar tenders should be fired."}
{"text":"I so wanted this to be a great pizza place because it is the closest pp to our house. Read all reviews and realized quickly everyone has different tastes so I should stop depending on FOOD reviews. My husband got the Naked City & I got the Guinnea(reviews & menu say it has meatballs but it was a flat piece of meat that I thought was sausage). Have to say these were different than any other pizza I have eaten. I cannot understand how an Italian named Guy Fieri could call this good. The place is a dive, but I wouldn't care if the food was good. I will go back to try a sandwich but it better be a whole lot better than the pizza. On the Food Network website someone says this place was featured on the local news segment of Dirty Dining...if you ever saw some of these places that are closed down by the Clark County Board of Heath it would literally make you sick. The poster said it was reinspected and reopened (I read this review after eating the pizza). It has become VERY popular because of the segment on Diners, Driveins & Dives, very disappointing but another restaurant featured on \"Chopped\" called Rosemary's diner isn't a dissapointment and we go there again, it is a breakfast & lunch place only. Another recommended foodie recommended place is right next door to Moondoggies(Naked City Pizza) it is called Desuno tacos,if you order food from both NCP and Desuno they will let you eat your food at Desuno, good to know if you have kids, but you must have ordered from both places. The crust was like bread, not pizza dough...granted you got a lot of food for the money, but I wasn't impressed to go back for pizza, I will try the sandwiches and review that at a later time. All in all the people that gave this pizza 5 stars must have gotten drunk before they ate, just sayin' 3 stars is being generous."}
{"text":"Excellent. Location is tricky for non-locals and the non-adventurous. It is well worth the walk or drive. The turkey and the tri-tip scream quality. I've had the royal (Italian sausage) and it was good but stick with the turkey and beef. Definitely go for the Weck."}
{"text":"We returned for that deliciously sinful buffalo chicken dip. We also ordered a half sheet of the Pizza Bianco. Three of us filled up and we still had a few slices leftover. We reheated them the next day and I'd say those slices were even better than fresh. Nice flavor, thick crust. I wouldn't hestitate to order it again. I'm told the Bacon & Eggs is really special. I might just have to give that a whirl."}
{"text":"I found this place while watching diners drive-ins and dives. Guy said their meatball ricotta was awesome so I had to check it out. The pizza was out of this world. Coming from the east cost I found most pizza out here sucks. This place is now one of my favorites. Looks like they have a large menu of bar food to choose from. If your looking at pizza and wings for a park your ass Saturday or Sunday in football season check this place out."}
{"text":"Definitely a dive, but in all the right ways.  The waitress was nice, helpful, and quick (and really cute too).  The suicide fries definitely bring the heat, but it doesn't linger too long, so you're not wishing for death later in the night. Nice and hot while you're eating, but gone when you're out in the casinos later that night.  The Guinea's Pie pizza was excellent. Probably one of the better pizza's I've had, if we're being honest. The meatballs on the pizza are awesome by themselves, but combined with the ricotta, garlic sauce, spinach, and mozzarella it really turns into something super-powered.  Stop by if you're in Vegas, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Arrived in LV Wed. afternoon and decided to stop in Naked City Pizza as I always try to check out eateries that I've never been before. Well, here's the official word from the White Hat, \"Just do it\"  I don't know why people complain about being neglected? I talked to two servers and Mike the owner. Had a great conversation. Mike even brought over a couple of tacos from his taco shop next door to check out. Great too!  Pizza on a scale of 1-10 rates a 10. Then Mike told me of the other place his brother runs across and down the street from Hard Rock Cafe where they do fresh pasta everyday! I will make it there, next stop for sure. You gotta try at least two small pizzas cause taking the rest to hotel was a treat to eat by the pool! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, drink and watch football. Guinea pie and suicide fries are a MUST. Although I preferred this place when they had full table service, I will still continue to bring my friends. Wish it was not so close to the bar (smoke) and I wish I could bring my kids.."}
{"text":"how this place made some show with guy fieri, i dont know, must be a favor of a friend who owns the place or something.  the pizza doesnt have enough toppings on it.  the taste wasnt any good.  i ordered a not so wee (which is equivalent to their medium) with pepperoni and mushroom.  wouldnt go back if it were free."}
{"text":"We'll my review is only based on the fact that nobody came to our table to wait on us. After 10 minutes of sitting there with nobody  paying attention to us, we got up and left."}
{"text":"Love the loaded fries, the medium wings are bomb. Not to mention the pizza is amazing with the fluffy crust, delicious sauce and REAL cheese. Soooooo good!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city! Suicide fries are BOMB! The bar gets busy at completely random times so you never know how long of a wait for beer or food, but the staff run their butt of making sure efveryone is taken care of. If you only go to one place in Vegas, make this your stop!"}
{"text":"Great pizza place.  Super dive though.  Hard to find because it's inside a bar. 21 and up only.  Great food!"}
{"text":"Came in twice, wasn't impressed both times, poutine is not authentic had some pizza chimichanga things I came in once at 4pm and at 10:00pm same results. I tried!"}
{"text":"good food, but shitty service..waited over an hour for a little.pizza on a slow night, finally went up to ask what was wrong and our order wasnt even in the system! Whats worse is my girlfriend is pregnant and you can tell, so needless to say she was very hungry, and no one offered to apologize by comping us a salad or anything. Then when our pizza finally made it to the table our server had an attitude and just \"here\" dropped it and left :/ sorry dont think pizza is worth the attitude, dont think we'll be back :("}
{"text":"I don't really understand the great ratings for this place, I'm hoping I caught them on a bad night.  I'll be brief.  The pizza was nothing special and the service was God awful.    The people watching was great, if watching a couple dry hump is your thing.  Most of the bar patrons were DEEEEEEEE runk.  Note that I had been drinking and was pretty far from sober myself.  I'll be back in the area to eat next door at Desnudo Tacos, but doubt I'll eat here again.  That is all."}
{"text":"Without a doubt one of the best meals I've ever had. Fantastic pizza. Hot, crispy, plump wings. And epic donuts. So, so good. Don't be fooled by the crappy strip mall/liquor store vibe. Excellent."}
{"text":"So I first tried this pizza at a catered attorney party and let's just say it has left an impression! Oh My So So Good!!!! To think this is coming from a girl born and raised in Chicago so I know a thing about pizza.  I literally got home that night and had to google where it was located.   Definitely will stop in the near future! Give it a try I think you will be pleased you did."}
{"text":"My family ate there three years ago. It was the most amazing pizza ever. We took pics posted everywhere. We met up in Vegas and all we heard was everyone wanted naked pizza. We had to order pick up because one of us was 7. We ordered but this time after bragging about them not only was awful. The order wrong. When I called letting them know, they flipped it around on me. We ordered pizza poutine wings. The only thing that came out right  were the wings. That's why there's 1 star. The pizza was burnt top and bottom. We asked for sausage & mushrooms on half and pepperoni & pineapple on other. We got pepperoni only. We ordered poutine and only got fries. I called and told them what we got once back at hotel and I was to I should have checked it. I sent my two nephews and husband who like most trust they get what I ordered. Really?!? How rude and wrong. I tried to get it corrected and was blown off. If you want talk about this again reach out."}
{"text":"The Guinea pie was delicious as always!  I've never had a bad experience at Naked City.  Just go there!"}
{"text":"I love this place and I love the owners but I am literally devastated that my pizza logs are NOT your normal pizza logs. They are half the size and lame. I was charged what your normal logs cost- someone should have said you're out of the regular ones. I hope to god they're not these ones from now on!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've had outside of NYC metro area.  Service was non existant.  You have to order under a sign that says \"orders\" and then get your own paper plates and napkins.  Kinda weird but in a good way?  A welcomed change to the  nonsense of the strip."}
{"text":"Don't be scared off by the look of this place. Amazing pizza and super hot suicide fries! Staff is great!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is here. Have tried pizza on Paradise Rd and did not like it at all. Crust style too thick for me & it was supposed to have fresh mozzarella & basil which neither were on it. Had grandmas meatballs, suicide fries, and a Ceasar salad here. The meatballs were a joke! Sliced not even round..like hard mini meatloaf & salty as hell! My Sicilian grandma would roll over in her grave. Although I must say the suicide fries were wonderful!! Why 2 stars. Haven't got to the salad yet. No desire to try anything else except for fries.....too bad for a pizza place"}
{"text":"Since we didn't get a chance to even try the food tonight, this review is based solely on the customer service.  We had some friends that posted pictures on Facebook and it looked delicious so we decided to check it out.  We went in a little before 6pm on Monday evening.  There wasn't a sole around - no customers and no employees. We figured they would be doing something in the back and would be around shortly. We sat down,found some menus and picked out our food, and waited.  We started yelling towards the back. No answer.  We walked into the back area and even around by the register.  Not safe at all but never saw anyone. When we eventually gave up, we saw Moondoggies next door and went in there to see if they knew what had happened and they have a window to Naked City.  We went to the window where we could see three workers chatting away.  The two girls looked at us and pointed to each other.  The blonde girl drew the short straw and had to deal with the customers.  I explained that we were waiting next door for quite a while but that there wasn't anybody there.  In a very accusatory manner, she told me that she was the only one working on that side and she had to step out for a minute to get some boxes.  The word choice wasn't the best but could be overlooked.  Her obvious inability to tell time might even be overlooked but imagine a 5 year old princess right after you take away her ice cream.  This was the attitude that we encountered.  It was obviously insulting to her that we had the audacity to want to eat in a semi-timely manner and we immediately walked out.  There was no way we were getting spit-free food.    The food may in fact be very good but I'll never know."}
{"text":"Only thing wrong with bar that I could find is it is a bit of a dive, if you really consider that a problem, which I don't! While I can't rate all the food the guineas pie was off the hook!!!!!!! The pricing was great 4 of us ate and had drinks and we're less than $50 bucks with tip"}
{"text":"When you first arrive to this restaurant, you seem a bit hesitant. A pizza joint near China town seems a bit curious, but the pizza is delicious! Don't let the run down pub turn you away; their rectangular pizzas glisten with oil but man, is it delicious. Our table ordered a Frickin Huge (which is actually very huge, about a 13\" x 9\" pie) Naked City pizza. The pepperoni and sausage they use are very flavorful on their own and enhance the overall flavor of the pizza. The peppers and onions also adds a nice crunchy texture to the pie.   Did not think I would like this pizza shop much, but left definitely wanting to come back."}
{"text":"Dive bar. In a shady area, but WAY worth it. Some of the best pizza in Vegas and by far the BEST Caesar salad (bc of the dressing) I've had. I order the guinea pie every time. And they have beer towers. Always a plus. But the pizza is just the best."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the pizza since it had been featured on Dives, Diners and Drive-Ins.  This place is unabashedly a dive.   It was pretty busy, so service was slow. It looked like there was one waitress (Possibly two) for everywhere that wasn't a bar.  She was friendly, but if you are going somewhere after dinner, plan accordingly.  When we arrived there was a hockey game on, so the sound from the game wasn't too much of a distraction, but when they turned off the game and put on the music, WOW IT WAS LOUD. I mentioned how absurdly loud it was, but the waitress was either deaf from always listening to loud music or didn't hear me. Bring your ear plugs if you are averse to loud noises.  Seriously, Airplane takeoff's are not this loud. The volume was up so loud that one of the speakers would occasionally cut out.  The Pizza we ordered was very good, and even at the \"Wee\" size is enough for two.  We saw a table of three order the \"Frickin' Huge\" size and I doubt they were able to finish it.  It wasn't the best Pizza I've ever had, but it is certainly deserving of its reputation of a good pie.  Overall, if we were to return in future visits to Vegas we would get our Pizza to go. The loud noise, in addition to the bar smoke (Its a bar, so I expect people to smoke, especially in Vegas, the worlds largest smoking area) make the ambiance a little more dive than I'd like to spend time in."}
{"text":"Thank you, Trey for helping us deliver food to those in need and to people helping them! Although we are not local, we send love to Las Vegas through you. We will definitely need to come try your food on our next trip. Lots of love xx"}
{"text":"Suicide fries are to die for! :) Spicy, but if you can tolerate it, they're totally worth it! Also had the Guinea pizza. Delicious! I would also recommend the chicken wings!"}
{"text":"I went not even a week ago I had won $1500 on sports parlays and offered to treat 2 of my friends to pizza and beer .One of my friends recommended this spot I ordered 2 quarter pizzas and a half Double sausage and pepperoni with extra cheese there was like no sausage very little the extra cheese was there and it was not worth it .I'll stick to Rossetti pizza or Metro in Ellis island"}
{"text":"Decided to try after watching DDD on foodtv. The food was AMAZING! We had the chicken finger dip (spicy Buffalo goodness!) Hot wings, the guinea pizza, and steak and cheese pizza. Everything was phenomenal! They had a delicious homemade ranch with the wings that I almost spooned out of the cup!  The only issues we had was with the service. She was very nice just slow. Our appetizers came out the same time as our pizza which made a lot to eat at once. Our drinks sat empty a few times as well.  Other than slow service we would recommend this place to friends. With a service warning label. Wish we would have found this place before we were about to have a baby!"}
{"text":"everyone who claims this pizza is super bomb,must be on crack!  b.s. toppings!! no flavor meatball!!  pound for pound one of the weakest pies i ever had ever.. & yes i know thats a bold statement to say,but i had better pizza in north texas then here,what a damn shame!! i tried this place 2 times. the other was the diners,dumpsters and dives special pizza ,and i had issues with my stomach afterwards. thought lets try another pie i said. when it got home we all were disgusted by the weak toppings & made my other family members to vow never to return to this b.s. place ever,not even for wings. if i could i would give this b.s place a negative star. not worth your time and especially $$$!! i would say little ceasers is just a bit better topping and valve priced & superior. should rename this garbage clark county jail pizza,this experience killed my night!!!"}
{"text":"There are some items that are not pizza that are amazing. They can make anything really."}
{"text":"I'm guessing we went at non peak hours so the place was empty. We ordered the Rebel pizza and chicken wings. The pizza was off the hook but the wings were a bit disappointing. Dry and not very tasty. The food was brought in from somewhere outside.... Weird."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza! Had the Guinea with meatballs, spinach and a white sauce. Loved the crust! My husband and I were a little skeptical as it is a dive bar, but is perhaps the best pizza that I have ever had!"}
{"text":"This review is for their new location on Paradise. We had been in town a couple of years ago and stopped at the Arville location and we couldn't wait to go back.  We decided to go to her new location (Wed, November 19th) on Paradise since it was closer- and we were excited.  BIG mistake.  The menu offered just a few of what they offer at the Arville location.  NO Philly steak or pizza rolls here.  We ordered the back home pizza and stuffed peppers.  The pepper was split with a little melted cheese and was totally raw and crunchy.  The pizza came out and looked like something I could have got from the frozen section at the store.  The cheese and toppings were minimal.  the outer two inches had no cheese or sauce at all.  while the middle was a soggy mess.  I asked for a side of marinara so I could  at least eat some sauce with my crust and it was brought to our table ice cold.  I was so disappointed.  It should be noted on their website that the new location does not have the same offerings as the Arville place.  If this location continues to send out food like we received, it will close, and soon.  Would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"I've lived in vegas my entire life.  Awesome sandwiches and vegetarian options.  This kind of sandwich shop is refreshing to see in vegas."}
{"text":"Checked out this place after seeing the latest Diner's Drive-in's and Dives. Had the suicide fries, they were Really spicy (in a good way), needed to down a gallon of milk on this one. The pizza was OK."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years now - before they were on DD&D's.  The food has always been great (the wings are Buffalo-style and so is the pizza), although sometimes the quality can be inconsistent (especially the Paradise location).  Last night, though, our service was pretty bad.  My wife and I decided to eat in the \"family\" section, mainly because we hate smoke and it seemed like the best option.  We ordered the Rebel pizza, a single order of wings, and pizza logs.  The girl working was nice, but to be honest, was not very helpful.  Here is where my problem is: I tipped her 18% and she did nothing but taker our order.  Some other girl from the other side walked our food to us.  We had to get our own plates, napkins, forks, etc.  Besides the smoke, another reason why we went to the \"family\" side is because there was no table service.  I'm not sure, but it seems as if they got rid of the waiters/waitresses.  This would be a 5-star review if the service was better (this goes for both locations)."}
{"text":"Good but really really greasy. When we got garlic knots, the pastry was still doughy."}
{"text":"I came to Las Vegas for my honeymoon and went to get pizza from here and no one was in the building we waited for 10 minutes and still no one so I decided to call the lady was very short with me said she'd be there waited a couple more minutes and still no one so we left."}
{"text":"Will I be back? Hell yea.   Will I order Pizza Egg Rolls? Hell No.   Yes, yes, to the suicide fries and the poutines and the pizza.   Everyone we met and spoke was super nice. Atmosphere was cool."}
{"text":"What an absolute DIVE! But if you want great pie and cold burruh here you go Suzi Quatro! Even the slices by themself are great...no need to order a whole pie. If you wanna get'cher pig on, get a whole pie...it is splendidicity."}
{"text":"This little gem may be Vegas' best kept secret (even after Triple D). Great \"western NY\" style pizza and probably the best wings in town. All of this and it can be found in the bast dive bar in town, Moon Doggies. Cheap cold beer, friendly staff and regulars"}
{"text":"As others have said, this isn't a classic pizza place. It's a bar, that serves pizza and sandwiches and such.  I should preface this by saying I judge all Italian food by the very high bar set growing up in NY. We don't often eat Italian food out because not much measures up...   We had sandwiches, not pizza. They were good. Good enough that yes, we are willing to try the pizza when we're back in town but not so good we'd rush there 1st thing.  This review shouldn't imply there is anything wrong with giving it a go - just be aware of your unavoidable childhood prejudices ;-)"}
{"text":"Interesting ambiance, thought the pizza is excellent... definitely and experience.... just make sure you were jeans and a black tee shirt"}
{"text":"Yummy food! Whenever I'm out of town, I always make it a mission to check out local pizza and wing joints. This place did not disappoint. It was good to get away from the Strip to dine out. Pizza and wings were great. The atmosphere may be a turn off because it's in a dive bar. If you get pass that, this place is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Probably the best variety of pizzas that I have had while in Vegas.  It is worth the 30 minute drive just to have their chicken finger pizza."}
{"text":"Visited this place last night.the pizza was very good but the service was okay.a guy ordered in front of me ,he received his food in about 20 minutes,i got my order a hour after he received his and the cashier excuse was he had alot of orders come in.when i did receive my order the pizza was luke warm and it was for dine in.they either need help or a better system"}
{"text":"I decided to give them another try. First the bartender was super friendly and quick. I ordered a pie to go and ordered the Garlic Fried for there. The fries were really good.I was sitting on the kitchen end of the bar and they came out and gave me a sample of the pickles that they brine in house. Also very good. And this time the pizza was good, not the best ever but a good solid pizza. So I dont know, maybe its different cooks in the Kitchen who knows"}
{"text":"Via postmates delivers to Bally's hotel rooms.  I'm a CT/NY pizza snob 10/10 really good pizza!"}
{"text":"Naked City is inside Moondoogies bar. If you order food and drinks, you will get separate bills for each. 4 beers @ $3.50 each - OMG, really - how awesome.   The huge, huge pizza is $32, we ate about an eighth of it, and my son will eat the rest of it for a week or so. We saw two large gentlemen attempt to the pizza eating contest (apparently if you can eat a large in 30 minutes, I assume it's free). Yeah, they ate about 1/4 of it. It is really good. And I thought very reasonably priced. The suicide fries, I like hot and spicy, but there was an ingredient in there that seemed to distract from the other great flavors. but that might just be me.   The waitress, a buxom young woman with tatts was just awesome. She carded my son (who had forgotten his id, so a trip home and back) just added to the experience. This would be my neighborhood \"dive\", and I mean that in a positive way, if I lived in Las Vegas. A ton of food at very good prices"}
{"text":"just as good as it looked when watching triple d on food network. poutine fries and pizza were off the hook and the placeis a great dive to drink and eat all the goods while playing a few hands on video poker or watching the games. staff was on par and a great break from the strip!"}
{"text":"Holy Mother of all Pizzas! That was the best pizza I've had in EVER!! And the wings...I'm a happy woman! And I'm hard to please!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Vegas hands down! I had the Guinea Pie! If it is your time this is a must have!"}
{"text":"All you people that give this place a low rating need to go eat the crap down the strip... This place is great... I love the chicken buffalo chicken dip thing lol and the meatball pizza. this place is way better then the shit they have down the strip."}
{"text":"Mom and I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak Rolls for a starter. They were the bomb! Sweet and hot peppers, steak, cheese, and onions all deep fried in egg roll wraps. What's not to like? Pizza with pepperoni, meatballs, and hot peppers was also really good. The restaurant itself is 8 or 9 tables tucked into Moon Doggie's dive bar. The bar itself has a funky stale smell, which does interfere somewhat with the taste of the meal. Those rolls though! Couple orders to go, and you'd be set."}
{"text":"Haven't tried the pizza s of yet but their chicken fingers are delicious and there is an atomic sauce for those who like a lot of heat. They are always big and taste amazing the only reason I did not give them a four star rating was due to the difficulty of getting a delivery from them. They only deliver through GrubHub and there have been times I have wanted to order and StubHub was not offering delivery from them."}
{"text":"I was *highly* skeptical when my girlfriend brought me here.  First off, she found it on a show on the Food Network, a channel whose hosts and content I have found generally worthless.  Secondly, they serve Sicilian-style (square) pizzas, a type which I don't care for.  Thirdly, the owner's trademark pizza (\"The Guinea\") doesn't even use tomatoes or tomato sauce, which seemed bizarre and wrong-headed.  How wrong I was.  We ordered two of the small pizzas (or \"Wee\" in Naked Pizza parlance): the Guinea, and the Meat Lovers.  I figured the Guinea was going to be a throwaway, since it is a white pizza, but since it was what caused our visit, I figured what the heck?    It is superb.  Outstanding.  Delicious.  And I am saying this as someone who normally hates hates HATES both Sicilian AND white pizzas.  Evidently I had never had them done right before this.  Now I will be confused and unsure of my pizza-ordering for the rest of my life.  Oh well.  The meatballs are hand-made and fabulous, and the white sauce is creamy and flavorful.  The crust isnt oily or heavy -- complaints I've had about other Sicilian pizzas.  The meat-lover's was also good.  Not the same \"I-once-was-blind-but-now-I-see\" type good as the Guinea, but decent.  It took a while for them to come out, but it was worth it.  The portions were large enough that we took more than half of them home (and just had them again for lunch.  They were still good, both cold and reheated in the oven.)  The bar itself is a pleasant, dumpy, dive bar.  Not too smoky while we were there.  Service at the bar was friendly, and we didn't have to wait much.    Definitely a thumbs-up."}
{"text":"I ordered the Naked Pie for pick up- told 40 minutes to pick up.  I don't understand all the raves about this pizza or place.  I don't mind divey, but this place was just sad.  The pizza was fine, but the pepperoni and sausage both tasted very cheap and unmeatlike.  Just a preference thing, I don't like \"square\" pizza."}
{"text":"This place has become a must stop for me when visiting or going through Las Vegas.  Last time I was here I went to the Paradise location, this time this location better met our needs.  It was around 10 PM and we needed some quick food on our drive back to St. George, Utah, so we did a pickup order through the Yelp app.  20 minutes later we arrived to pick up the food and found that it appeared to be closed.  Luckily some locals pointed us to the attached bar where you can pick up the food late at night.  I'm really not sure we would have figured this out on our own.  Inside the bar there is a small window that you can talk to the pizza people through.  They told us it was still being prepared and would be done soon.  We sat at the bar and waited.  We got the food and got in the car...my girlfriend did the ordering and I don't remember the pizza that she got.  It was the smallest, which is still a decent size, philly eggrolls, and of course my main reason for being there, the suicide fries!  These fries are amazing.    We started our drive as I entered spicy nirvana.  The flavors are amazing, the pain is real, the heat is fantastic.  I sweat in two new places that I had never experienced, inside my ears and on my eyelids.  It was painful, but so tasty.  I just kept going, fry after fry, until I had to stop.  Everything was so good and I had finished about 3/4 of it, with a few peppers left over.   I don't really know how to describe the flavor, but it is just amazing.  Don't eat these if you can't handle seriously spicy food.  They are so good.  I had some of the pizza to calm me down and take away the heat.  I like their crust, not thin, but also not too thick.  The cheese was delicious.  The philly rolls were pretty good as well, but I only had a bite or two of them.  Overall it was another great visit, 2/2 so far.  I look forward to next time I have an excuse to eat here!  Prices are good as well, only $5-6 for the rolls and fries and the pizzas are big!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of dive bars and good pizza. Put them together and you have a winner winner drunk pizza dinner! Naked Pizza is open until 3am. My friend and I got there around 1:30am, sat up at the bar and played video poker while our pizza was being made.   Pizza dough is thick but light, not too doughy and did a good job absorbing some of the alcohol so we could keep drinking. There was a good amount of cheese and toppings on it. As other Yelpers have mentioned this place is a dive so bring your expectations down a notch and you'll be fine. Bonus: our bartender, Leo, was super cool and made us a drink to go (we cabbed it)."}
{"text":"this is the best place to get wings to go  i came to their location in the moon bar with friends and my friends were incredibly put off by the smoky atmosphere and the lack of draft beers..   too bad so sad as i warned them about that. we got a variety of wings and pizza and everyone left a happy camper ..  i see that they are now in the blue diamond saloon.. i'll be there soon to see if it's comparable"}
{"text":"A coworker of mine suggested this pizza joint to me, and shortly thereafter, I saw it on an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  I figured the pizza here must be amazing if it's featured on DDD.  Boy, was I wrong.  The service and pizza were alright.  Nothing worth writing home about.  Personally, I think Metro Pizza off of Maryland and Tropicana is far superior, both in quality and service."}
{"text":"Went with one other person, ordered 2 slices, fries and a sandwich. Guy at the window said it'd be a 30-40 minute wait which seems fair because it looked like he was the only person in the kitchen and we were going to get some drinks at the bar anyways.  10-15 minutes later our food was out and everything tasted great.  Overall it's a good dive bar with good music, good food, good drinks and fine prices; only $2.50 per slice."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza, incredible pricing.  In from Santa Barbara for the weekend and hit this place on a Sunday afternoon.  Super divey 30 some dollars for 2 small pizza and a suicide fry.  Screw the pizza on the strip I'll get a cab here, it's better hands down."}
{"text":"We got the Guinea's pie and loaded fries. Both were exceptional. The fries were probably the best fries I've ever had. Which is saying a lot because I've had many fries in my day! The pizza was very different but so good. The sauce was amazing. Will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Being from Syracuse which is close to Buffalo we had to try Naked City Pizza and we found a Great NY Pizza like back home. We are Italian and I have to drive 14 miles one way to get one but I would do it in a NY Minute. Everything about the pie is Super from the dough and sauce to all the Topping that you could want. Do yourself a favor and order one as I am going to do right now. You will Love it, Trust Me I am a New Yorker to the core."}
{"text":"First they closed down the actual pizza place roughly an hour before closing and directed us to the next door establishment a bar where they also operate and serve pizza.  We waited over and hour after ordering the 6 slice box. Additionally, orders that arrived after ours, larger than ours came out sooner. Customer service and updates to our order was poor.   I've yet to actually eat a slice of pizza as I'm driving back to the hotel now. I'll think to update on that."}
{"text":"Bookmarked this placed based on their claim-to-fame of having the best sandwich in town- as rated by LV Weekly in 2012. Returned a few times for various pizzas, and my verdict is that while the crust is consistently good, items are generally hit or miss.  The ROYAL HOT SUB sandwich was my BF's favorite: Italian sausage, capicola, and mozzarella chopped in two equally enormous halves. Bread didn't seem particularly fresh, both meats were fairly dry to me, and there was no moisture on the sandwich, lending an overall dryness to the whole affair. It worked for my guy, and apparently for the staff at LV Weekly, but it wasn't the best to me.   SICILIAN WINGS were underwhelming: 50 cent surcharge for this flavor, for reasons unknown. Wings were perfectly cooked to tender and juicy, but lacked flavor. Minimal sprinkle of garlic and parm outside, mostly smaller wings, again they just didn't really do anything for me.  BEEF ON WECK Pizza of the day was not my style but I really appreciated the creativity that went into taking a NY sandwich and creating a pizza version of it; beef on top, horseradish sauce, creamy mozzarella, and a salted/seasoned crust. Flavors are strong and bold, tasty, but not something I'd eat more than a slice of.  FATBOY PIZZA is the bomb though: Cappicola, pepperoni, ham, Italian sausage, crushed tomato, mozzarella cheese, fresh basil and red sauce. It smells amazing and tastes even better, the tomato and basil really add a lot of flavor. I like that though it as several meats, they're distributed in such a way that it's an overwhelming grease bomb like other meaty pizzas.    I think I need to leave this place on my list to visit again and try the Guinea pizza when I have a bigger appetite (or perhaps after hitting the gym). I've been mostly underwhelmed by non-pizza options here."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've ever had in my life. It's doughy, cheesy, greasy goodness that still is not overly heavy. Thank you for making Las Vegas a better place Naked City!"}
{"text":"When you don't want the party to end but REALLY want some good bar food...  Inside MoonDoggies. Where else can you get a hearth style pizza at 1 AM while at the bar?  All I've ever had here is the margarita pizza and it is awesome. 2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"I ordered some French fries and it was so greasy you could fill a shot glass full of grease. I threw up as soon as I got home. I also asked for thin crust for my pizza and they only had one size dough. This was the worst $40 I ever spent in my life"}
{"text":"Om nom nom nom. The pizza is delicious. I usually like NY style pizza more than thick or deep dish, but this crust is all fluffy and delicious like a supersoft unsalted pretzel. I tried the pepperoni and the chicken finger pizza, and they were both awesome with gooey, bubbling cheese. I don't normally like pepperoni, but it was seasoned and really well cooked. Pair it with a beer, and it is junk food heaven.  As for the atmosphere, I suppose it could be called a dive bar, but it isn't a very divey one. It seemed fairly clean for such a designation, aside from the glimpses of an unpleasant looking men's room I got each time the door opened (complete with dudes at the urinal) ;)  I didn't find it smokey, and I am not a fan of cigarette smoke. Perhaps this was a result of being there in the middle of the afternoon. The decor is an intriguingly tacky mix of surfing paraphernalia and 60s kitsch with glittery ceiling, and the staff is very friendly and easy going. The clientele was a mix of middle aged folks, casual business men, and chill 20 or 30 somethings."}
{"text":"Its a good sandwich. Wish they could heat them up to melt the cheese. The meal with the sides is a lot of food.   I wanted the fingerling potatoes but he gave me the potato salad instead which turned out pretty good.   I would give it another try."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever.  Kind of weir llocation inside adifferent establishment.. bar, but it.works.  Will absolutely eat there the next time I am in Las Vegas...Hope they are open on Thanksgiving."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go through the enormous hassle of going to this place when I have young children, but I do.  The drive from Summerlin (or anywhere else in the Valley) has been worth it every time.    I am recommending it tour our visiting CA guests, and I guess I must love this place if I am able to take the time to write a review while my toddler smashes tomatoes in my lap for fun.  I am not supposed to be eating food like this, but the Royal on weck tempts me every time.  I am aspiring to try out the soups instead of a sandwich, but just take the time to try this place out and you'll see why I keep going back.  In the last 10 years I have seen so many great places go in this town, and I hope that this place stays around for a long time to come...ever think of opening up a Summerlin location?"}
{"text":"Well this place did not live up to all of the hype! I'm from Buffalo but live here in Vegas now and was excited to check this place out. They claim to be a Bills and Sabres bar but sadly that's not the case. I had friends in from Canada who wanted to watch the Sabres game and I called twice on Monday to make sure they could show the game. The first time I called the girl asked me if the Sabres were a football team! She proceeded to tell me I had to call back the next day and ask the bartender. I had my husband call later that night in hopes of speaking to someone else and getting a definitive answer, after all our friends from out of town were driving all the way from the strip so I wanted to be sure. My husband was told that they would for sure have the game on TV, not on sound (which was fine) but definitely on TV. Fast forward to the next day (Tuesday) we get there along with our friends and guess what?! They didn't have the game! They said they had the package but they couldn't get the game! If you have the package you would've had the game! I was furious! Then we decide okay well we'll eat at least since we're already here. We go to order Loganberry and you guys were out. So then we order a Labatt's you were out of that too! We walked up to the window and ordered our food, and there was a girl there that had the biggest attitude I've ever seen. Everything was annoying to her. At one point I got up and asked her (as she was standing at the bar talking) where the to-go boxes were and with a huge attitude she says \"UGH go to window and ask them\". I've worked in restaurants before for almost 10 years and I've never seen such AWFUL customer service!!! I don't know how you can claim to be a Buffalo bar and \"Home of the Sabres\" when your staff didn't even know who they were and you didn't show the game! What an embarrassment it was for us in front of our friends from out of town! You claim to carry all these wonderful things from Buffalo except you didn't have half of it! I was greatly disappointed with our first and only experience!"}
{"text":"Oh man so much good food. Couldn't even make a dent in it. Big portions, great prices. Will definitely be back when we visit LV again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas ! The wings omg everything is amazing.. I go at least ones a month."}
{"text":"I had some serious high hopes coming into my \"dining\" experience at Naked City Pizza Shop in Moon Doggies. I'd heard a lot of good things about the wings, and being a massive wing fan, I was anxious to try them out.  The Good: - The hot sauce was actually hot. (All too often, the hot level is barely medium.) - The hot sauce had a different and interesting flavor. Not your average tavern wing sauce. - The suicide sauce, of which I got a side of, was one of the best super-hot sauces I've experienced. - On the day I went, Naked City had partnered up with Fukuburger (food truck). - Moon Doogies itself is an ok dive bar.  The Bad: - The wings themselves - the chicken - was not of good quality. - The wing sauces are very thin and liquidity. While the flavors are good, there is a lack of substance. - Everything comes \"take out\"-style. You can sit at the bar or a high-top table and eat, but you're doing so out of styrofoam containers and little plastic cups. - The wait for the food can be quite long.  The Ugly: - The dipping sauces, ranch and blue cheese, were awful - among the worst I've experienced. (Good dipping sauces are a requirement for achieving good wing status.)  Now, admittedly, I've only tried the wings here. The menu was intriguing enough that I anticipate a return visit, where I'll try the pizza and maybe some other items. However, given the quality of the wings (or lack thereof), I don't have particularly high hopes."}
{"text":"Garlic buns, salad, chicken strips and pizza are all excellent."}
{"text":"Probably the only thing keeping me from giving five stars is all the phone numbers I could find to order delivery didn't work. We ended up ordering through ÜberEats which is a cool service. The special meatball pizza (can't remember the name) is awesome! We also had the steak and cheese pizza which was good, if you like jalapeños. The seasoned fries were not bad but didn't survive the delivery well.   Next time I'm in Vegas I'll go to the restaurant and eat in, and no doubt will give a five star rating."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've ever had.  I read a lot of the reviews so I was worried about the service, but I had no problems.  I was the only one in the \"eating area\" so maybe it's hit and miss depending on how busy they are, but the waitress came fast, the food came fast, and she came back often.  I ordered a Wee pepperoni/sausage and it was exactly the type of pizza I like.  The cheese stretches out, the crust has a crispy outer texture but is softer inside, and the sausage is the crumbled kind, not the Domino's type nuggets.  I'm not a huge red sauce fan but I didn't even notice it.  I got the wings (naked) with the suicide sauce on the side.  People are right when they say it's spicy but it doesn't stay with you.  I'm guessing it's habenero.     The total for the pizza, 10 wings, and a soda was $22.  I managed to get through about half of it and I'm a pretty big eater.  I'm definitely going to go back when I return to Vegas in the future.  Everyone has different tastes in pizza, and if this is the style you like, you're going to love it."}
{"text":"Love me some Naked City! The Bianco is really good. My hubby always leaves whatever bar we are at(that doesn't serve food) and picks up a few pies to pass around. The Naked City is a great pie for next day pizza eating. All the ingredients are fresh the crust has a nice chew and when it is cold the next day all the flavors are married like a good Quiche."}
{"text":"Without a doubt one of the best places I've ever ate at. Amazing atmosphere where children can go to play games, there's plenty of sitting area if you are looking to throw a party, a range of video games that are free roam to play, its great. I ordered the guinea pie and it was TO DIE FOR. It was so good and our waiter was very kind and funny, the perfect place to take your kid for a birthday dinner with friends, or just a hangout for you."}
{"text":"Please take \"delivery\" off Yelp status, or put the hours that delivery is actually available!  I have called at least 4 times for delivery and they never have a delivery driver available. I asked When is a good time to call for delivery, and they said 'try the weekend'.  I ate there once with a large group of friends, and loved the food, especially the Guinea."}
{"text":"Great food. Horrible service. My friend asked for a recommendation from the  person taking the order. The guy replied..\" I'm to bizy for this, look at the menu\". The food came out with no forks, Plates or napkins. We asked the server for some help. He told us we were getting a favor by him bringing the food. We needed to ask someone else for more help. He was off the clock."}
{"text":"Two words ... Guinea Pie.   Delicious pies. Don't let the low brow bar put you off.  Either get the pie to go or slum it.  The Guinea Pie is great but their others are delicious too."}
{"text":"Food here was pretty good.  I would have given it a higher rating if the service hadn't sucked so bad.  Hot fries were good but not overly spicy.  The wings had good flavor but not too crispy.  The wife ordered pizza and it was awesome.  The cheese sticks were also good.  It took us over 30 minutes just to pay after we finished our meal and our drinks ran empty a few times.  I would come back but just for the food."}
{"text":"This place is mine & my husbands favorite place for pizza in Vegas! Pizza & wings taste amazing! But keep in mind, their large is HUGE!"}
{"text":"Quarter sheet, half sheet, full sheet, whatever sheet you get, it'll be delish pizza.  Ordered the following (of course, I was with a bunch of friends): Suicide fries: WARNING: VERY SPICY. But it was still amazing! Fries with jalapenos and their house made house sauce.  Guinea's Pie: meatballs, spinach and ricotta. All amazing.  Veggies Pizza: Yes, the name says it all. Onions, tomatoes, mushroom, spinach. Yeah, veggies.  Margehrita Pizza but they spelled it as \"Margarita:\" tomato, basil and mozarella. The basics.  Bacon and Eggs Pizza: This was the most intense pizza I've ever had. They bring out the pizza and crack an egg on top of it and starts stirring it ON THE PIZZA! But it was still good!  Defo come back here and order one of those very tall beers. When eating anything spicy like the suicide fries or chicken fingers, chase it with beer NOT milk."}
{"text":"I've had a few things here and they have all been good. I tried this place after seeing it on DDD and it really is a dive. I tried the Royal first which is a sausage sandwich and then the Guinea's Pie. Both were really good. I would recommend take out though. The atmosphere is a little rank."}
{"text":"This place has super super yummy poutine and delicious pizza. Pizza is a greasy and super yummy. New waitress is rude AF but whatever! Still worth it"}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed in Naked City Pizza Shop. How dare they be 20 minutes away? I can only imagine how delicious this pizza must be when it's hot and fresh, and I'll never know unless I eat it there.  Which is never going to happen. Any place with a big banner that says \"Smoker Friendly\" isn't going to be seating my sensitive nose. That's not a criticism: NCPS is inside Moondoggie's bar, so the smoking is reasonable; I get it. But I can't mix the smell of cigarettes with food, so it's my loss.   NCPS was suggested to my husband here on Yelp when we asked about where to get a pizza that wasn't NY-style or Chicago-style. I love Grimaldi's, and I don't hate Chicago-style, but where ARE all of the \"normal\" takeout/delivery pizzas with a thick crust, evenly spread toppings, and cooked all the way through? (I thought it was Metro. It wasn't. Northside Nathan's is a fave, but it's also a bit far for take-out.)  I'm glad a Groupon came up or we never would've bothered to make the trek to this dive, and I mean \"dive\" in the \"fun, casual, non-derogatory\" sense. Mostly. Even so, we waited until the day the coupon expired. The lure of a potentially good pizza almost didn't beat out location and atmosphere.  I got the \"not-so-wee\" (half-sheet) with mushrooms, ricotta, and garlic. This is a new combination for me and now one I look forward to trying elsewhere. (If I ever find an elsewhere.) I've been eating this pizza for three days now, so believe me that they're honest about the sizes. The \"frickin' huge\" is the next step up and more for dining in with six friends. The step down is the \"wee,\" which I imagine has the benefit of more edge pieces.  Ah, the rectangular pizza and the problem of the edge-less middle pieces. It's one issue that keeps me from getting take-out at Northside Nathan's any more, but NCPS's middle slices were so good that I didn't mind the lack of edge, and a fine edge it is. Chewy, thick, but not hard and kind of fluffy. I could've done with an air bubble or three, but this is good.  My husband got the Stinger without bleu cheese and with \"red sauce\" as opposed to no sauce, I think. (The red sauce has a tiny kick to it - nice.) Let's just say that his didn't last three days.  I was really intrigued by the cherry-chocolate malts, and in just the past few days they've added online ordering, but it's really not a place I want to hang out - not inside, and not in the parking lot, either. For that I have to dock a star. But this is just the kind of pizza I'm looking for... now someone please tell me where to find this in the southwest?"}
{"text":"Alert - this business does not have the same menu as Naked City Sandwich Shop!!!  So there is no tri tip sandwich on the menu.  There is no kimmelweck.  Yelp transferred the reviews from Naked City Sandwich Shop here but it is a completely different menu!  The current Review Highlights are not accurate.  That being said, pretty darn good food!  The pizza was awesome!  I'm usually weary of square pizzas as they tend to be too thin for me and lack flavor in my experience.  But this was good stuff! Thin crust, a little crunchy, and so flavorful.  I highly recommend the Fatboy.  The subs don't really hold a candle to the Naked City Sandwich Shop offerings.  But the sub I got was pretty good.  The Stinger, which has steak and boneless buffalo wings, was inventive.  Note - the pizzas and subs share some of the same names so make sure you clarify what you want when you order.  The poutine was pretty good (fries covered in gravy and cheese curds for the uninitiated).  I've never had poutine before so I have no frame of reference.  But the fries were excellent!  My favorite kind.  Skin on, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  So yummy!  Chris, the guy running the entire operation, took my groupon without a problem.  There were some unique specials on the board, such as pork ragu, so make sure to check the board beside the window before ordering.  The restaurant will only deliver within one mile and I can't get the online ordering system to work, ever.  Even when it was Naked City Sandwich Shop.  It's inside a smoky Moondoggies.  Just look for the sign that says pizza by the slice.  I dig the food but it's not in my hood and video poker bars are not my thing.  Unless I can get a food runner service to deliver from here, sadly I think this will be an infrequent trip for me."}
{"text":"Originally from Buffalo, NY but lived in Vegas nearly 21 years now. With pizzerias in our family and worked as a kid in one being known throughout the country (located in buffalo) I will tell you 100% naked City has the best Pizza & Wings  in Vegas!  Margherita, crispy & greasy, only way to eat Pizza and Bleu cheese with your wings (NO RANCH SERVED IN THE B-LO).  You need to try this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on the Triple D site and had to go. We were staying on the strip so took a cab. There is a little sign above a black door with a door bell button on the right. Don't need to buzz just walk in. We weren't sure we were at the right place when we walked in but the staff was friendly and assured us we were. Pretty typical dive bar atmosphere, the owner is from Buffalo so there was a ton of Buffalo stuff on the walls which was nice as that is the area we are from. We ordered two wee's to split between four of us:   The Ginuea: This was featured on the show so we tried it. Fantastic!! The sauce was what put it over the top for me.  The Margarita: I was a little disappointed in the lack of sauce and basil(I was just expecting/wanted more) but every one thought it was good.  We finished with the fried dough: powdered sugar, chocolate sauce and fried=mmmmm.  We inquired about getting a cab to get back to the strip and the waitress called one up for us. I told her I would include her name and I forgot it (I'm very sorry!) but she was great. If I go back to Vegas I'll definitely go back. Even with the bar bill and tip it was cheaper than anywhere else we ate and as good or better."}
{"text":"Love the flavor and texture of the light buttery crust. Good quality pizza with fresh ingredients. It's a hole in the wall place with a laid back atmosphere. The crowd can get rowdy during later hours as the pizza shop is inside of a bar."}
{"text":"I am a native of Buffalo, NY and heard about this place when I first moved here, but live in Henderson so I've been a Santora's Sunset bar and Grille faithful for the most part.  Since Santora's closed (reopened under a new name, shut down and reopened under Santora's w/o Buffalo food ), I've been feening for some good \"back home\" food.  We saw the DDD episode and my BF's friend wanted to check the place out so we went this past weekend. Waitstaff is friendly, but service is a bit slow. I'm not sure if they were shorthanded, but the owner of the place does step in to help clear tables and such.  The menu made me hear Angels singing from the heavens.  They have pizza logs which are cheese and pepp w/ a touch of sauce wrapped in an egg roll wrapper and deep fried. They also do Philly cheesesteak logs...same theory. Chicken wing dip is something I make frequently for my friends out here for parties, so we skipped that.  Was delighted to see chicken finger subs and the Stinger!   Was disappointed however to get the chicken finger sub and it didn't have lettuce, tomato, or cheese /onion on it as I was expecting :(    The stinger is cheesesteak, chicken fingers on a sub roll with traditional toppings. The wings were just like home, crispy on the outside, juicy in the middle...however some people think they're overcooked because they're used to the wings being soft all the way around out here, and honestly, that's not the way Buffalo does them people.  Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Hot sauce is actually hot!  It's just like home. Normally, I'd order hot out here and get something along the lines of medium but this place does it right!   Now, the pizza. I've been struggling to find good pizza out here and the best I've had thus far is Mama Mia's on Buffalo near Flamingo, or Northside Nathans.  This place does a good crust.  The crust actually rises and is airy and soft.  The toppings are fresh, and the sauce is not overly acidic or sweet with tons of tomato paste.  I tasted home.  :)    Next time, I'm going to get the poutine fries which are french fries topped with brown gravy, and cheese curds on top of that. It's more of a Canadian dish, but Buffalo NY being so close to the border of Canada, we know what it is and it's great!   Will definitely be back to watch our football team lose yet again this season, and drink cheap beer $2.00 bud/bud light drafts or bottles during games. Same story for the Sabres."}
{"text":"True hole in the wall, but great pizza and wings. The environment might scare you as this awesome eatery is inside a bar, but well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Start here: Naked city is a dive. It's inside Moon Doggy's bar, which is a divey sports bar. But! If that doesn't detour you, then the pizza is awesome and drinks are cheap. We sat at the bar, which I recommend, and our bartender was friendly and  cool. Our food came out quick, and the pizza was excellent. If you're a fan of thick crust, bubbly pizza with a brown crust, this is the pizza for you. And, it's huge. The wee is HUGE. The other size I'm sure is bigger. Bring your friends to help you finish, and have a few cheap drinks!"}
{"text":"I admit we went here because of DDD (Guy Fieri).  The dive atmosphere did not disappoint.  Good bartender, even though the bar was wet/sticky.  We ordered wings and pizza.  The wings were very good, as was the pizza, although it took a very long time before the food came out.    The food was good, but they don't have the ability to handle the popularity of this place.  It's a tiny kitchen with one person cooking."}
{"text":"After seeing this place of DDD I knew I had to visit here on my trip to Vegas from New York. I am so glad I did! Food was amazing and had a great beer selection! Of course the I loved the pizza but I was surprised how good the wings and fries were! Everything is made from scratch and very fresh. This place and any of the naked city pizza locations are worth a visit while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to check out another Triple D Joint and once again it lived up to the hype.  After a long day of football and a night on Fremont street the wifey and I opted to just grab a quick slice and call it a night. We remember an episode of Triple D that raved about a dive known for their pie and so we decided to see if Guy was just giving us lip service. And so we found our way to Naked City Pizza. I must warn you this is a total local dive right next to Moon Doggies (Watering Hole). Not much on atmosphere just righteous Kick Ass Pie. All elements were choice, Great Crust, Fresh Toppings, The Sausage was old school killer good,  The sauce not too heavy but with Huge favor, layered, not soggy or mushy. Fresh, Hot, Crisp , Cheesy, Everything just pops! Definitely a takeout joint. Locals are Huge  Buffalo Bills Fans transplanted to Vegas. If you find yourself in need of pie while in Las Vegas Give them your hard earned dollar. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was very comfortable in this joint. It is on the dive bar side, but it is a place you can hangout and have a good pie. The dough is good, the topping even better. It has Buffalo, New York all over the walls and it is reflected in the good pizza. I loved the sizes: Wee, Not-So Wee, and F_ _ k'in Huge. Most of the people around us had eyes bigger than their stomach's so take-home was the norm. They also have Buffalo wings, which are great. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best pizza ever. It's a hole in the wall but its amazing. Flavorful crust and the meatballs are amazing. Second time here, still impressed!"}
{"text":"When in this part of the valley and looking for a 'nice-a slice-a of the pizza pie' this is a good choice, and suicide fries are HOT HOT HOT (and not in the Buster Poindexter kind of way).  Three alarm my friends..."}
{"text":"Ordered the garlic knots and guinea pie and both were bomb diggity.  The pizza is HUGE- I think we ordered the equivalent of a \"medium\" and there were plenty of leftovers...  The slices are square cut and they use high quality ingredients.  Unfortunately we were a little confused when we entered on the non-bar side because there was a private event taking place.  When we entered the bar, we awkwardly stood at the door wondering whether we should wait to be seated and then just took a seat wondering if we were going to be waited on since there were a few staff members serving food.  Eventually, a staff member came over and told us to order at a window and then take a seat.  Had we looked a little harder, we would have noticed the big \"ORDER HERE\" sign next to the window, haha.  Only negative is that it was hotter than hell in there!"}
{"text":"A hidden pizza spot, I think more secret than Secret Pizza inside Cosmo...  No doubt one of the best pizza shops in Vegas, but the consistency is all over the place here.  We normally order from this location so maybe the other 2 are different, even though this is the original.   I don't even know if they deliver LoL I think they do, so you should get it... so why 3/5??  Once, we ordered a pie and I waited the 20-30 mins before going in and went to the window for my pickup.  The girl at the window proceeds to tell me there isn't an order by the names I've given. Hmmm. I verified we called the correct location and she asked the other employees if they knew of my order... Low & behold, they knew we ordered and said all the orders weren't coming in at all. I'm thinking, if you know this, why not handwrite the orders until the problem is solved by management/owner? I waited for the pizza and wasn't even offered a discount, free drink or anything...  I work a lot of conventions in Las Vegas and encourage the booth owners to order pizza for setup days... we order the largest pizza. I'll tell you, the first time, it was so amazing, I actually ate 4 slices!! I couldn't move for 10 minutes, but every bite was worth it, but it's been 2 years now and the last times, I can barely get through 2 slices before calling it quits. Even if I'm \"starving\". Sometimes the crust is so thin and cardboard tasting, other times it's burnt and disappointing. I honestly don't remember the last time having a perfect Naked City pizza.   I'll keep trying them because there's always those days when the pizza maker is on effing point, and those days make you understand why people love pizza and this place.   Just wish the consistency of quality was where it should be."}
{"text":"Ordered Fatboy pizza and hot wings.  Both were nothing short of awesome.   My wife even asked for a side of the suicide sauce and that is her new favorite.   BOOM!"}
{"text":"Stumbled in here one night for drinks with a few friends, it just looked like your average hole in the wall bar. With that being said the drinks were amazing and i had a great time. I later saw this place on the food network and was shocked, i had no idea that they served FOOD!!!!! Lol, BEST PIZZA IN VEGAS!!!! They have my vote :) PS: The wings and suicide fries are also equally amazing..."}
{"text":"The pizza shop that's located inside of Moon Doggies bar. Currently, my favorite pizza style...Buffalo rectangular sheet style pizza. I generally have stomach discomfort after eating pizza...but I feel great after consuming their pizza. I don't know why...I'm sure I'm a bit lactose intolerant as almost everyone is as they get older, but no stomach bombs after eating this pizza and I have eaten it a few times.  I started frequenting this bar for football this year. Cool bartenders, cheap drinks and good pizza!  Dream scenario? And it has happened, but not enough! When Fukuburger visits the parking lot...drinks and pizza on the inside, great burgers on the outside!"}
{"text":"Best best best pizza in town! Omg the Guinea! Those meatballs! I dream of them! Chris I want the recipe! Oh wait! It was on DDD with Guy Fiery! Lol. So glad you made a success of journey! Congrats!"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends who have been here a few times. You walk inside a dive bar and order from a window stand. I wanted to try the Guinea Pig pizza because it was featured on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives plus they had my favorite pizza toppings. However, my friend didn't say it wasn't good or bland without the tomato sauce so I told him to just order and I'll just eat. We went with an order of wings, Back Home pizza, and the Fat Boy pizza.   The woman at the counter wasn't friendly. I had never been here so didn't know whether to leave tip when I order or at the table. I added my tip to the order which I hate doing. I prefer to tip after not before I get my order. No thanks from the employee, just abrupt service from a worker who clearly didn't want to be there. I was irked at myself that I left a tip for her.  We sat down and the pizza took a while, maybe 25 minutes? We ordered a pitcher from the bar. My friend had to clean and clear one of the tables. The wings came out first and they were decent. I was divided when it came to the two different pizzas. I didn't like the Back Home pizza. It reminded me of my high school cafeteria pizza but more doughy. My slice had random splotches of cheese and it was runny. The Fat Boy was the complete opposite which was loaded with cheese and toppings. It was a good pizza but nothing extraordinary. Did two different people make the pizza?   I don't think I'll be itching to come back here anytime soon. It's not a pizza I would go out of my way for and the service just doesn't motivate me to go back. Plus there were some scary looking people at the dive bar so I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Went in search of a good carry-out pizza: mission accomplished.  Ordered their \"friction' huge\" pepperoni pizza, and asked for it to be \"extra crispy\" or cooked a little longer than normal.  They were happy to oblige.  Couple of notes:    1. Extremely tasty. 2. Medium crust height: definitely not thin or deep dish 3. Square pizza (hence the missing 5th star--I don't understand square) 4.  Frickin' huge means--could comfortably feed 4-6 people who are not starving; I would estimate this would the equivalent of one-and-half large round pizzas (17-inch) 5.  Yep, it's a dive bar.  Bar on the right side, pizza order window on the left.  Nice crowd."}
{"text":"Yey I'm a huge fan! The hubbi and I decided to go here because he seen it on tv! He told me we both did however I cant recall if I saw it or not...nevertheless...I'm glad he saw it...We saw it...lol The food is divine the pizza was so very good (Please see my pictures.) We also had wangs yes not wings but wangs because they so good u have to give them a slang name. (KMSL)  If you high sadity or booshie this is not the place for you. (Stay home.) But yea the husband and I fit right in because we get along with everybody! Its cool people with a fun time & just great food. The cheese cake was very good. Its a fact that the husband and I have found a new spot to chill and have fun."}
{"text":"This place is a low-key fun place to go for a quick and yummy slice and beer. The slices are really big with lots of cheese and you can pretty much get whatever toppings you want. Great location, too - around a couple fun bars!"}
{"text":"Elias my roommate is crazy! he ordered a half a sheet for 2 people! we gave it our best! took out one slice over a quarter! the blend of cheese, herbs and sauce is delicious! but wait there's more!  jumbo I repeat jumbo chicken wings! with the basics! mild medium hot etc.  chill atmosphere with bar and slots!  well worth the wait! they have a #suicide chicken wing sauce available with hints of habanero!"}
{"text":"Very non-descript building. Attached to Moon Doggies Bar. Low key dining area. Paper plates plastic forks, dirty floors and wobbly tables. This place is about the pizza! The pizza is some of the best I've ever had and makes up for all the lack of amenities. Medium hand tossed crust. Perfect. Great red sauce on the \"Back Home\" pizza. Tasty pepperoni and spicy Italian sausage!  Interesting how they mix the sauce and cheese on this specialty pie.  Food is ordered at the counter and the poor gal working there runs back and forth to the bar where the kitchen is. So if you show up and it seems no one works there, be patient, she's running her tail off next door.  No beer or wine served in the dining side. But I was told you can carryover from the bar in a plastic cup. Get your drinks first before heading next door to eat.  Pizza gets a solid 5 stars, the restaurant a 2, the help gets a 5 for hustle."}
{"text":"I tried the suicide fries after I saw them on diners, drive-in and dives.  They looked so spicy and delicious!  I was happy with the fries when I got them even though they were in a Styrofoam container but I thought they were going to be spicier.  They still had a good flavor and i enjoyed them i just expwcted to be crying from the heat.  We also had some pizza rolls and pizza.  Overall I would get back but prob to their original location."}
{"text":"Spendy at $9+ per sandwich and I cannot support a sandwich establishment that doesn't have fries on the menu. FAIL."}
{"text":"The fries at this place are off the hook. We tried both the suicide fries and the garlic fries. Both were dynamite. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times before and its been so/so - HOWEVER this time around they were a bit busy and the waitress was VERY rude. She kept putting her hands in the air saying how busy she was and ignored us on multiple occassions.  I will rate next time I go to give them one more shot"}
{"text":"It's located in a bar that plays loud country music.  At least when we were there.   Had a pizza and a salad.  Both were excellent.  Pizza crust was chewy, sauce smooth and well seasoned and plenty of stretchy cheese.  Salad was equally well prepared and big enough for 2 or more people.  Price was reasonable as well.  Will definately go back."}
{"text":"Love the food! I haven't had anything I dint like. I always go when I'm in Vegas. The only thing that's weird is that they have separate billing for the bar & the food. They had to charge my card twice.  The service was average, the waitress wasn't very attentive. The bartender has to bring it to her attention when someone came in."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday and then Monday. Both days was closed. Came because of triple D tv show. The door says open 7 days a week. Not so for those of us who watch the show. I think these are all Guy's buddies and he tries to pimp yh out as a favor on his show. There were two other couples with kids that were very disappointed."}
{"text":"At first we came or the Taco Tuesday, but the flavors just weren't there.  So we switched to the pizza, we ordered the steak and cheese and it was SLAMMIN'!  I'm craving more of it today. Next time I'm gonna try the covered fries and a different pie.  I found my new pizza spot!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza..... Took my mom and dad when they were here on vacation. They went crazy for it. Yummy"}
{"text":"Would have given 5 start but my pizza logs were super greasy, yes i know they are fried. I was looking for a bar that reminded me of home so i googled pizza logs and it gave me this place. If you want a little piece of Buffalo, ny this is the place to go. Brought a couple of coworkers with and gad an amazing pizza along with some pizza logs. Definitely will be back. Also, your caesars dressing need to cut back on the garlic"}
{"text":"Pizza was super yummy. Had the Guinea pie. Inside of Moon Doggies bar so 21 and over only. Salad was huge and 1/4 sheet was too much for hubby and I. Pizza was even good cold next day. Wish I'd saved room for the zeppolis. Next time!"}
{"text":"Pizza was fair, cheese was tasty toppings a bit sparse. Menu on Yelp is not up to date. Pizza was more expensive than what was listed by about $3.  Delivery guy not available so used post mates for delivery. Didn't expect a 9% service fee either.  Post mates did a good job in getting it here while fresh. May visit them at their place but won't get delivery again.  Pizza logs were tasty too but very greasy."}
{"text":"TIP: The pizza joint is open until 3am, so it's perfect for late night pick up!!  On the corner of Arville and DI, Naked City Pizza is located inside Moon Doggies Bar.  Such a chill establishment.  The pizza's great and fairly priced--$16 for a medium.  The medium is huge and fed 5 famished girls at 2am in the morning--with leftovers.  Unfortunately, they don't deliver at that time, but I came in for pick-up.  We were staying at the Artisan so it wasn't too far away.  The guy that took my order over the phone was cool, and he was finished with the pizza right when I got there.  The bartender was super sweet; gave me a free shot since it was just my birthday.  Definitely gonna hit this place up again!"}
{"text":"After realizing there is a buzz about this place being on the Food Network, I had a chance to stop by here for lunch!  A friend and I shared a Guinea's Pie.  This pie comes with meatballs, spinach, ricotta, white garlic sauce and mozzarella cheese, and was the one featured on Diners, Drive Ins & Dives.  The show made it look really good, so we had to try it!  The pizza, cut up into squares, was quite tasty.  The dough was well crafted, and the cheese was high quality.  The ricotta comes in a thin layer I think, and blended really well with the mozzarella giving it a slight creaminess.  The spinach was light and went really well with the pizza. Probably the most impressive thing about this pie was the sausage.  According to the show they make the sausage from scratch, starting with grinding the meat.  It was superb!    The bar that Naked City is in is nothing special unless you long for Buffalo, NY.  Bills posters line the walls, the dark dive bar atmosphere lit lightly with blue lights.  The service was top notch and fast.  The water was served from flip top bottles and tasted filtered and fresh.  The beer selection was a little weak, but they did have a local Tenaya Creek beer on draft that made up for it.    Is this the best pizza in town?  It is damn good, and probably the best \"Buffalo\" style pizza I have had, however there is at least one pizza place that goes above and beyond this one (however it is more of a NY style pizza).  Your tastes may vary.  In any case, this spot is worth a try for sure!"}
{"text":"Located inside of the diviest of dive bars, but that's not the issue to us - we enjoy a good dingy dive bar.  We came here for 2 reasons: 1. I had an emergency late night pizza craving.  2. This was the only place open past 12am that had decent reviews (namely because Guy Fieri recommended them on Triple D.)  I'm just going to put this boldly out there - the pizza was a lie.   I can't necessarily state that Guy is lie on this one, because I bet this place used to be good, then triple D aires, then the word gets out, then the hype man takes the stage, then they cut massive ingredients and quality to make a profit. Right. It's a sad tune we're all too familiar with.   The pizza itself was very dry and I can honestly state it was pretty much all thick, dense dough. The dough wasn't even special or memorable - not even slightly sweet or anything that would make it stand out. The tomato sauce was barely noticeable and it wasn't robust, or striking in flavor. The cheese was also extremely limited as well. Everything fell seriously flat on our taste buds.  The toppings were all few and very far between. The meats were sparse and standard, nothing to holler home about. There were tiny specs here and there with spinach. Seriously!? How expensive is spinach, that you can't even hook an honest paying customer up with it? It was truly nonexistent.  Let me ask you this, why did we get the pizza with no love? I think my theory is concrete and valid.   Here's what we regretted ordering: Fatboy \"not so wee\" Pizza: $21 - subbed sausage for spinach  - subbed salami for ricotta  - this pizza advertised basil yet they some how forgot the basil? (forgot? or, on purpose... my paranoia is beginning to wonder...)  Pit BBQ Wings: $8 (single = 10pcs?) - hahahahaha they either, a.) Skimped us, or, b.) Don't know how to count - either way, that's totally annoying and frustrating when you pay for 10 wings and expect 10 wings, but get 9.  (To be fair- the bbq sauce was robust & the wings were well sauced)  Ranch: free  - very runny and watery   It's pathetic that I had a better pizza slice at Sbarro in the mall the other day - the red pizza sauce they had there was full of life and flavor, plus they probably put 1 handful of spinach on that 1 slice of pizza. Sadly, that's the opposite of Naked Pizza.  The only thing they got going for them is this: open until 3am.   $31 bill for a disappointing pizza dinner is not cool, not cool at all. We wasted our time and our dime."}
{"text":"Overrated reviews.  Have 12th sliced pizza and was not impressed at all.  I live in NY and need to say that every pizza I have was better than that.  As well price is to hight."}
{"text":"Since my initial time here, which was great, I have gone  to Naked City 2 times since then.  The last 2 times have just been a solid OK. The food is still  slightly above average but no longer amazing and I tried the Tomato Basil soup the last time and it was slightly below average  to me.  You brought my expectations up and then right back down Naked City.  The service  has been very good all 3 times I have visited but I felt the need to update my review as to not steer fellow Yelpers in the wrong  direction. The sandwiches are  OK to slightly better than OK.   It is better than Subway? Yes. Is it worth going out of your way to find? Not really anymore.  The name  and old school pictures on the wall still get points from me. The inconsistency the last 2 times I have gone  and the above average prices deserves and update in stars.   I am hoping this is a hiccup that Naked City can fix because I would love to see it do well. As of right now I don't feel its worth going out of your way to seek it out. If you happen to be in the area and want to make a trip downtown or to Luv-it then its worth trying out.   The kimmelweck roll is damn good as is the Habenero pickle.  Now either the quality has to improve or the prices need to come down.  Get it together Naked City."}
{"text":"So getting here is a little strange. It's inside a bar. So when you walk in, you walk towards the back and there's a little ordering station on the left hand side. You order, pay, then go sit down anywhere in the bar until your food's done and they bring it to you. We had a just a standard pepperoni pizza and it was amazing! The sauce has so much flavor, perfect amount of cheese, and it's just great. The mild wings are my favorite thing! The wings are actually good sized, they make it crispy, and they put a lot of sauce on it. It's not too hot either which I like. Normally I can't even handle mild but I could with these. They do close so I recommend coming before 10."}
{"text":"Real food...made by Real Punk Rockers.  Had the loaded fries tonight and they were crazy good.  It was at least 3 lbs of fries loaded with 1/2 lb melted cheddar cheese, tons of real chunks of bacon and sour cream.  I took these fries for the road (to-go) and what a terrible idea that was.  Needless to say I need a new shirt because I ended up wearing some of it.  Shoulda brought a BIB I suppose. The fry portion was so HUGE I will be snacking on this for at least another day.  The small portion feeds about 3-4 people.  Don't say I didn't warn you the portion is HUGE. I will be back to try the suicide fries, but I will have to have a beer or two first before tackling that dish.    I will keep updating this review as I work my way thru the menu."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Las Vegas! The crust, cheese, and fresh thick cut toppings, just awesome. Wish they would bring back their Chili Cheese fries!"}
{"text":"When I came here, it was a Tues or Wed afternoon.  We pulled in, and i didn't think this could possibly be the place.  I verified three different ways, and thought...this is so sketchy.  Then I had the food.  I can not think about buffalo anything without salivating over their buffalo chicken dip.  It really was amazing food.  The atmosphere...very dive bar (very very dive bar), but OMG the food."}
{"text":"Cheese pizza is delicious and my favorite is the philly egg rolls. It's a must half when I order from there"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I am not the biggest pizza fan, I do not have a \"thing\" for pizza, I think the majority of the pizza places in the valley are waaaay over priced and overrated, and there is a surplus of pizza/italian restaurants in town to create an internal \"demand\" for me. And after working in a pizzeria for a summer when I was 19, I was pretty much over pizza for the rest of my life. However, this teeny-tiny kitchen with a window inside a dive bar (Moon Doggies) that has blacked out windows, and still requires you to ring the door bell at 11am, is by far the best pizza I've ever had in my life.   Normally, I don't even crave for pizza, but after the last two times I've visited this place within the past 2 weeks, I still can't get enough of it. But these Naked City guys and their tiny spaces with their big food ventures are hitting it out of the park with their sandwiches and pizza.   The pizzas themselves are \"Buffalo, NY\" style, which I guess means having rectangular pizzas, like Sicilian style, but with a much less thick and dense crust. That doesn't mean that their slices aren't dense, because they most definitely are and filled me up with 2 slices. But when they're hot, the crust is crispy on the outside, and moist and chewy on the inside, and the cheese is bubbling hot. The first time I went, I got the Guinea's Pie that had meatballs, spinach, ricotta, white garlic sauce, and mozzarella on it, and I asked that he add some basil too. It was out of this world. Plus the guy that was working there was super nice and humble, and was really, really glad that we liked his pizza.   The second time I went there was to pick up a pizza to go, and this time I got the Veggie Pizza--with sweet and hot peppers, onions, tomato, broccoli, olives, spinach, mushrooms, mozzarella, and red sauce--and added some meatball to it to satisfy some meat-loving co-workers. What they don't mention in the menu is how spicy the crust is from the hot peppers. I love spicy food, and this was just in between \"I can handle it\" and \"Whew, I need some water!\" spicy. While the crust didn't maintain it's crusty/chewiness on the drive over to North LV, it was still pretty damn good. I also got the Naked City Bread Basket, which was not as good as it sounded in the menu, but may have also been due to the travel time it endured. It was a little hard and dry, but the toppings made it okay.  As a fan of Naked City Sandwich Shop, I was happy to learn that they also use that awesome garlic mayo in their subs at their pizza shop. I have yet to try their sandwiches, pasta, or wings, but I wouldn't mind giving it a try if I could tear myself away from their pizza for a minute.   One more thing about their pizzas: they're HUGE and CHEAP! Aziz B. and I each got our own \"Wee\" pizza, which I think translates to medium, and they were like a large anywhere else. At 11 bucks a pop, they came with 8 slices where I could only finish 2, and Aziz--an actual pizza lover--could only finish 3 of his own. Now that was something of an eye-opener to me. Well, so was the slightly inebriated and possibly stoned bartender we were chatting with as she drooled over our pizzas, but that was to be expected."}
{"text":"From 5/24/15 After hearing so much about Naked City Pizza, we wanted to see what all the hype was about! We came in here hungover from the night before hoping to get a bit of grease to soak up what booze was left in our systems, and this seemed like the kind of place that could help us out with that  kind of problem.   Naked City Pizza is basically a kitchen with some designated seating that is inside of a dive bar called Moon Doggies- hahahahaha. I'm sorry that name \"Moon Doggies\" is just hysterical to me lol!!   This place is  Buffalo NY inspired, as the owner is from B-Lo! Being from New York myself, I can honestly say this place looks like an Upstate NY dive/greasy spoon spot with it's décor, and age stains coating the bar. However, I have always noticed places like this seem to have the best food.  Anyway, we ordered mild wings and a pizza with spinach, onions, and meatballs. Are wings were the first thing to come out, they were cooked perfectly, not soggy, and had a slight bite for being mild wings-delicious! The pizza was next, it had a thick crust, and the meatballs on it were the size of New Jersey!! I was expecting the typical crumbles of meatballs you get on a pizza, but not this one it was huge- but that was okay with us! The pizza was delish as well, they use a good quality dough, cheese, and sauce.   Whelp with all that being said- Naked City Pizza is our new favorite spot, and thank you for curing our hangovers!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. and I used to live in NJ and swear nobody can beat their pizza. Well this one came pretty damn close to an old Sicilian I've been longing for... and it was so big we ate it for days. So worth it, the location on Arville is in a bar, but there is seating in a storefront right next to the bar so if you have a kid with you no worries. we didn't go to the bar and we sat in the empty store watching tv and stuffing our faces like you wouldn't believe. Will definitely return whenever I make it back to Vegas"}
{"text":"So I was told this place was good, it may have been but I didn't stay long enough to find out. Obviously the food is good. However I feel bad for the owner. He has the worst service staff I've ever seen. The restaurant wasn't busy at all yet our server took more than 10 minutes to greet us. She seemed really busy but as I was watching her, she wasn't really doing anything and she was being rude about it toward other guests. I saw when we walked in that she was sat 2-2 person tables and 1-3 person table. 7 people total. She continued to help 1 of the 2 person tables and told us and the other table that she would be with us shortly. It took too long so we left. We went and spent $85 at another restaurant. I'm sure this happens all the time here. The bartender saw us but didn't really help. YOU NEED A HOST!!! I cannot stress that enough. The 10 minutes I was there I didn't feel welcomed at all. I feel like its worse than just retraining your staff. You need to teach them how human beings should be treated. Personally I live to far away to ever want to come back but I'm telling you this because you're service staff is losing you money. You can tell they just don't care. When people don't care about their job they do shady things. Wouldn't be shocked if they were stealing from you honestly. Please address the situation or you will not have a business in the near future."}
{"text":"Naked City pizza on Arville was very good, we ordered a slice of pizza and garlic parmesan fries. We have ate here before and at the other location. However this time the fries were a bit overcooked. The slice of pizza is a good size and if you are really hungry try their \"freaking huge\" pizza. It is enough for a family of 5."}
{"text":"This place is definitely located in a dive bar.  Ordered a round of wings and Guiena pizza.  The wings were good, good amount of sauce and they were large in shape.  The pizza on the other hand was crap.  Pizza had no flavor or taste.  The Crust is very thick.  I would skip this place.  Guy Fieri got this place wrong!"}
{"text":"Second time here. First experience with staff was, well below expectations. Was with a friend and let that go because overall the atmosphere was a good one. The food was great. We even had a family eating. Now, we came back because we were in the neighborhood. We sat down and no more than 15 mins, a family with two teens walked in and sat down at a booth. No more than a minute passes when a staff member informs that only people at least 21 or above can be in the facility. Shortly thereafter the family leaves the establishment. Now I would not write this review if at the exact same time a group of males, all males, with two teens walked in and were not asked to leave. This experience is not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"Since we're relatively new to living in LV we've been looking for a great pizza place.  We finally heard about Naked City Pizza Shop from Diners, Drive-ins and Dives web site.  This place was a great experience - from the Buffalo memorabilia to the over the top wonderful pizza.  Pizza had the BEST flavor!  We wished we had room to eat more of it. Only complaint would be the servers - very, very slow and unfriendly.  Wish management would improve on this."}
{"text":"Maybe it's the well poured rum and cokes, but I am always on cloud nine when eating Naked City Pizza, I've had two different pies now and they were both excellent. The suicide fries are killer my mouth is on fire but I can't stop. This has become a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza I've ever had in Vegas, NY, Chi or anywhere else. It is so delicious in every way and even smells AMAZING. The dough is made from scratch and you can't go wrong with any of the ingredients they offer. Most recently we enjoyed a pepperoni, mushroom and sausage pizza. There's nothing else like it. I'm usually not a huge sausage fan, but I couldn't get enough. I could have literally eaten the entire pizza myself!!!  The incredible menu doesn't stop at the pizza. I've also had the stuffed mushrooms and wings, which were fantastic. I don't know how anyone could have anything negative to say about the mushrooms as they were SO delicious!!! I've never had better! I'm dying to try the pasta on my next trip!!! The menu offers far more options than your typical pizza joint and you can't go wrong with ANY of them.   You must try Naked City Pizza!!!"}
{"text":"When they were first there it was a Buffalo go to! Clearly a little success takes your eye off the ball. This is the second time in a less than 3 months I have had sub par food from a place that I normally recommend to anyone! Char-in cup slice was half baked zero char!...wings were undercooked and hot when I order medium.  Complained and received the oh well face. Naked  City is turning a blind eye...no response from my initial complaint because the \"brother\" runs the blue diamond saloon location. Moondoggies could have cared less. I'm not giving a 3rd time to disappoint. Spent my last $ of support."}
{"text":"This place was GROSS. I thought being a Guy Fieri restaurant it may be good. HAHA, NO.  I wished I had taken pictures to show you how unpleasant this experience was. 1) 0% cleanliness. The tables had crumbs on them, the floors were really dirty and the restrooms just indescribable. I almost lost my appetite. Worse than a gas station. 2) The pizza dripped fat like I've never experienced in my life. Specially the pepperoni one. Fat dripping like the freaking Niagara Falls. 3) The door seemed broken, being slightly open letting cold air and street noise in. The counter lady was gentle enough to close it, after struggling to do so. 4) Fries were brown and gummy, old. YUK!  If you like fatty grease dripping pizza then you may like it. There are way better places to eat pizza in Las Vegas and actually enjoy it."}
{"text":"The suicide fries are so good, they made me want to live a little longer. love the ambiance of the place. if you are brave enough to adventure out to a little dive bar you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Super Divey but GREAT PIZZA!  Cheap prices. Definitely recommend for a casual, quick bite and a beer!"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA in Las Vegas!   That's it.  But read on, if you must....  The square little pieces are great; my favorite piece is the center square!  I think it's the dough. It's so good! I heard a rumor the pizza maker gets water for the pizza shipped in from somewhere.  I don't care what his secret is, this is hands down, the best pizza!  Oh yea, the pizza shop is inside Moon Doggie's Bar."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in town!  The Pizza tastes just like it does in buffalo - fluffy crust, plenty of cheese, and with any topping you wish. Their wings taste just as good.  Hands down, the best pizza in town. I'm not a fan of thin crust pizza as many pizza businesses in town offer, so naked city pizza really hits the spot. Don't judge a book by its cover (dive bar)... the food is really something else. And they have labatt blue on draft. sold!!"}
{"text":"I've loved in Vegas for over 8 years. I finally just heard about this \"dive\" and decided to give it a try. Naked City Pizza didn't fail to deliver.   4 of us shared a pizza \"home style pie\" I think was the name? It was awesome. This is square cut pizza that has a great sauce and a thicker than average crust. SUPER tasty.   The real gem here are the home made fried. We ordered the garlic and the divide fries. I got the sauce in the side after yelp warnings. Which was perfect advice. These are in fire! But sooooooo good. I kept some sauce for my crust too. But I dip one too many times because my mouth got so hot I had to make an emergency bathroom trip because I thought my mouth was going to burn me to death. With that being said, this place rocks. And contrary to some reviews, our service rocked. VERY nice and efficient wait staff. Ill be back many times to come in the future."}
{"text":"went to this place today and the service sucked very bad experience and left them a message and they deleted my post ...did not serve us because color of our skin very racist treatment today"}
{"text":"Had a small issue with the ordering process...they were VERY QUICK to make it right. The pizza is still AMAZING!"}
{"text":"We were on another road trip, so that means! Looking up and see what food joint has been on TV? Naked City was on DDD, never seen the episode and was very skeptic about eating here? With my wife, daughter and her boyfriend with me. It was around 11:00 pm, after our Les Miserables show at The Smith Center. Wasn't sure if I wanted to bring my wife and daughter here? Place is not in the best area, and it's inside of a bar!! Moondoggies! But after we sat down and trying to talk with each other with the screaming, yelling, rock music on! We started to eat our food! Now with the shift change at the bar, the music changed! All of sudden we started to hear Journey, Boston, and Chicago! Music we can just lay back and listen to! Got myself my first Red Apple Ale, which I sucked down in 1 min! Now back to the food, we order three large ground beef tacos! Order the small! Large is like a burrito, just to large and ask for cheese, doesn't come with? There taco sauce is more of a buffalo wing sauce? I had no problem with it, it was different. But the girls did not like it! We also ordered a large pepperoni pizza, daughter ordered a side of large fries! Fries were very good, daughter loved it, can't really explain it? But there fries are different, and very good. Now their pizza! We all loved it, I can seriously say this was probably my favorite pizza of all time! Dough was thick but very crispy! I love the thin and crispy, when I seen the thickness of this I wasn't sure about it at first! Very cheesy, perfect amount of sauce and pepperoni were very good. Think I found my pizza place in Vegas! Glad we stopped by, had a great time to end our evening."}
{"text":"Yes - I'm giving this sandwich shop five stars.  The sandwiches are tasty, the sides are amazing, and the pickles (garlic or habanero) are out of this world.   The location is not what you would expect, but a trek into the Naked City to get a meal here is well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Delicious choices, although you'll probably need a nap afterward. We got the philly cheesesteak rolls, garlic buns and margarita pizza. Our food was delivered from the connected bar which was a little strange. The server brought it in the front door and flatware wasn't readily available, we had to request it. Other than that the service was alright. The food is definitely what makes a trip here worth it."}
{"text":"If you want atmosphere, furget bout it.  If you want \"DELICIOUS PIZZA\" gotta try it.  Some of the Best pizza in Vegas."}
{"text":"Saw on triple DDD. Pizza is best in town. Suicide fries were good but not as hot as I had hoped. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I went back to Naked City Pizza Shop inside of Moondoggies again to eat more of their menu, and as before I was not disappointed.  This time I had the Pizza, it was a big square slice of pepperoni pizza, the crust not too thick and not too thin, kind of like handtossed at most major pizza places, but it's actually good, not processed frozen dough that the big guys have. I am a pretty big eater and I have to say that it was a bit of work to get through the slice, let's just say that it's not a small slice!!!  I also gave the Pizza Logs another chance, last time they were a little chilly in the middle, this time they came out piping hot, after a little cooling, they were amazing...could be one of my favorite apps in town...imagine if a totino's pizza roll and an egg roll had a delicious baby.  I also tried one of their chicken fingers, it was crispy and delicious, They have added chicken finger tacos to the menu, one member of my group had one, and let's just say it's on my list to try next time.  This place is really starting to grow on me, the staff is nice, the bar is a great little dive bar, and the food is AMAZING. I only wish it was closer to my house"}
{"text":"We went to NCP on a Monday around lunch time and they weren't too busy which we were happy about. We ordered the Garlic rolls for the appetizer. They were so delicious and different from any other knots or rolls that I had had before. They have cheese in the middle and plenty of garlic taste. I will definitely have those again. there were 5 of us in my party, so we decided to order 2 pies. We got the Guinea's pie and the Back Home pie. They were both really good! I'm not a big an of spinach on my pizza, but I even liked it on the Guinea's pie. I'd try it again. I really want to try the Margarita pizza next time. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza.  Stuffed mushrooms were divine.  We loved it.  Service was marginal."}
{"text":"I took a chance and went down on a Friday night to pick up a sandwich and a pie to go...the chance I took was in taking my wife.  This place is the sweet spot that dive bars aspire to, and that is something that the two of us love, but I have a healthy respect for... I was worried we might walk into a smoky, crowded, death-metal mosh pit that I would have to bull through to get our food.  To our happy surprise the bar was pleasantly populated by the eclectic crowd you expect at a dive.  The bartender was quick to deliver our beers (22oz. PBR) and the food was prepared in a bit slower time frame than we might have preferred...we really didn't mind because the atmosphere was just that good.  Oh...and the 80's hit parade coming from the sound system was pretty sweet too.  The food was great...A guinea pie that really hit the spot and a Stinger that was a bit hotter than anticipated, but too tasty for me to complain.  I have yet to get a bad pie or sandwich here...dive in!."}
{"text":"Fabulous food. Great dive bar. You gotta try the suicide fries!   They are rock star.  Pizza was fabulous. The beer is ICE cold. Really you gotta try the suicide fries.  I'm writing this with beads if sweat on my bald head.  Great stuff!"}
{"text":"So tried this out for the 1st time tonight ... Quite a distance from our house but nevertheless.  The place is definitely a \"dive\" so it does fit into the DDD well.  I had to let my eyes adjust for a few seconds when I walked in because it's dark :)  Once I could see - we walked over to the takeout window and were greeted by a really nice waiter. He asked if it was first time and if we wanted some suggestions but I had my mind made up before we walked in lol.    We opted for the \"not so wee\" (about the size of 2 of their menus) size of the \"Fat Boy\" which consisted of Mozzerella cheese, fresh tomatoes, fresh sausage with delicious fennel seeds, pepperoni, ham and fresh basil. I also ordered a small poutine (for those not familiar it's fries served traditionally with brown gravy and cheese curds). Since I have an aversion to curds - I asked them to make it with just Mozzerella and they were happy to do it. Though I've had poutine in Montreal on several occasions - I grew up with cheese fries and gravy in Philly and for the life of me - it's a struggle to cheese fries in this town unless they have nasty nacho cheese on them.  The poutine was great. The fries were freshly cut, not very greasy and had just the right amount of cheese. They put the gravy on the side which was a brilliant idea as it was a 20+ min ride home - this way they weren't too soggy.  I'm not sure what else they put on the fries but I could have made a meal of just these fries. They were great!  As for the pizza - it was also great. I loveeeee that they make their own fresh sausage and that they use fresh ingredients on the pizza. Though it wasn't your typical \"dive\" pizza that I'm used to getting in a pizza shop back east - this was some damn good stuff. The only thing keeping me from 5 stars is that I would prefer if the pizza toppings were spread out more to hit the 4 corner pieces. Since the pizza is rectangular most of the ingredients are focused towards the middle of the pizza do when you grab for a piece along the edge you don't get to taste all of the flavors.  The entire staff was friendly and kept us up to date on our order.  We'll definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Pizza is da bomb!! I go here every time I visit Vegas. I can't wait to go again this weekend!!"}
{"text":"Place is horrible. It used to be good. Food quality and accuracy are a 1 star at best. And don't go there to pick up your food either...place is a dump"}
{"text":"The pizza tasted really good but the crust was to thick in my opinion. I'm used to NY pizza which is thin. If they can't make it thinner I won't be back."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday (first time) Pizza pretty good! And the chicken wings  no complains! Planing my second visit pretty soon"}
{"text":"Naked City has the best pizza in town.  The steak and cheese, add peppers is to die for!  The fries Mama mia!  Beef sandwiches....like french dip.  we went after saw on Triple d, been back 5 times in 6 weeks!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas hands down they know how too make great pizza closes thing too have pizza if yr from  Buffalo NY and try there fries they r the great & very hot"}
{"text":"Great pizza for 2:30am   Def ask for extra toppings though.  Great atmosphere and if you don't like sucks for you.   I did call ahead but apparently no one put my order in so that sucks, especially if you call ahead to avoid waiting!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Ordered the Guinea Pie from Bite Squad this afternoon. What a pizza! As a NYer, I was hesitant as it doesn't look like a NY pie, but the taste... incredible! Perfect balance of cheeses and crust and garlic and meatballs and fresh basil. Such a wonderful pizza. I will definitely be ordering again. Also ordered a small zeppoles. Enough to feed an army! I'm going to have to visit the location one day. This is too good!"}
{"text":"Food was great very yummy dough and the cheese was great but our server was slow, rude, and snotty.   Our server gave us attitude when we asked for boxes to take our leftovers in and she charged us for an appetizer we never got,."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week. Sure it's a dive, so what's your point? It is what it is.  I have ALWAYS got great service and to food is the bomb!  James the bartender is a great guy and is smart as a whip!  Drop your inhibitions, go there and have fun!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that the Guinea pie is the best damn pizza I've ever had in my whole 29 years of living! Seriously it's amazing I will definitely be going back again and I will definitely be bringing family and friends to try some of that Guinea pie!"}
{"text":"It's been a couple weeks since I was in Vegas, but I am still dreaming about a couple places, this is one of them! Found this place randomly, as we were driving around and just searching pizza on my maps. So happy we were closest to this joint, we took a gamble and won! When we walked in all we saw was a dive bar, not knowing if we were in the right spot, but we  walked in a little further and saw a small window in the wall, low and behold, this is where you order! There was only one girl working, it was almost 2am and she was pregnant! Not knowing what to expect, we were taken back by the awesomeness of this place!  We got a veggie and cheese pizza and a side of french fries. HUGE servings for a ridiculously low price.  We got everything to go and it held up perfectly until we got to our hotel. Thick crust pizza with tasty toppings, and deliciously seasoned fries (no sauce needed, and I usually always need ranch for dipping).  She did a fantastic job, we were so appreciative. Such a great end to our night:)"}
{"text":"Incredible pizza in a very unassuming strip mall. Don't be afraid to make the trip it is totally worth it. Dive bar seating or they have another section away from the bar. We had the guinea pie and and a veggie something. Really doughy crust and delicious. If you are a Bills fan it should be a definite Vegas stop."}
{"text":"Quite a few months ago I made a forum post on Yelp seeking my perfect pizza. Something with crust that's quite chewy, not undercooked, wet, floppy, or any of a dozen different complaints I can have with pizza in Las Vegas. Naked City was one of the suggestions in that thread as a place which might satisfy my pizza specifications.  You see, I'm one of those people who, every time they read a review for a pizza place that starts with \"As everyone knows, Las Vegas is a mecca for great pizza.....\" sighs in bogglement that my tastes are, apparently, so different from the LV mainstream with regard to pizza. I've searched high and low and nothing has perfectly fit the bill.  That was until I braved Moodoggie's Bar to pick up a \"Stinger\" pizza with red sauce and entered pizza heaven. Let's not split hairs - the place looks scary, the bar is right out of the early 80s, complete with sit down Galaga coin-op. The \"pizza shop\" is a window looking into a tiny, slightly grimy-looking (though I'm sure that's just age and it's perfectly clean) kitchen. And yet somehow it all works to create my idea of perfect pizza. A thickish crust with not too much sauce of the kind that isn't overly sweet or overly gloopy. Delicious toppings, correct cooking time and wonderful taste. It all came together to produce a huge \"not so wee\" pizza that I inhaled in an evening.  I can see why the place gets mixed reviews. Its appearance combined with the massive deviation from what most people seem to regard as \"good pizza\" is sure to throw a few cats among the rating pigeons, but if you're like me, and the thought of another sloppy, undercooked pizza that people tell you you're supposed to \"fold up to eat\", give Naked City a try. You might not regret it."}
{"text":"Amazing food. You can't go wrong with any of the fries, but might I suggest the poutine fries? So good! And the pizza...my gosh the pizza. Guinea pie is the obvious choice as it was featured on the food network. It did not disappoint. Any of the pizzas are rock solid though. It's self serve and really dark so if you are in sweatpants and your hair is kinda messy, don't even worry about it. This is that rainy day, lazy outfit type of place. I love it."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas with my Fiance for the first weekend of March Madness! Found this place on Yelp and it was sooo good! I signed up for Yelp just to write this review!   We had the loaded baked potato fries and the chicken finger and steak pizza (the name escapes me at the moment). Both were delicious! Add cheap beers into the mix and a bunch of TVs to watch the game and it was the perfect afternoon!   The bar is a total dive but not dirty or anything. If you are looking for good-cheap food off the strip, this is your place! The service was great! Nicole was our waitress and she was fantastic!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Buffalo late last year and had a sandwich, which is a Buffalo specialty called \"Beef on Weck\", which is Rare Roast Beef on a Kummelweck Roll (A Salted Bun, with Caraway Seeds in the shape of a hamburger roll).  I was thrilled to see that this place had one.  So I decided to go there for lunch.  The place is inside a bar called Moon Doggies.  I was disappointed, because of the cigarette smoke.  The bartender was really nice.  However, the girl at the window was very business and not friendly at all.  I ordered half a Beef on Weck and a slice of pepperoni.  And then I ordered a beer from the bar.  The pizza came out first.  I could not taste any sauce on it.  It was in a square and I got a corner piece.  The best thing I can say about it is that the pepperoni is PERFECT!  It was in small circles and spicy, the way I like it.  I just wish it was more conventional NY style pizza.  The sandwich was the big disappointment.  If these people are from Buffalo, then they have never eaten at Schwabl's or Charlie The Butcher there, because this is NOT Beef on Weck.  It was more like Philly Cheesesteak style beef, not rare, sliced roast beef.  And it was not rare, it was completely cooked.  The Kummelweck roll looked like a hot dog bun with caraway seeds and salt on it.  I'm giving it three stars, because the bartender was super sweet and it seems like a good place to have some beers or drinks, but I definitely would not order food there again."}
{"text":"Was in Las Vegas for the B2V weekend and after the race had a craving for pizza and fries. Elisa and I found this place on Yelp and when we got there, it was closed. 9pm on Friday night. Yelp stated they closed at 3am. A big pile of BS, if you ask me. Don't come here. They might be closed."}
{"text":"Went here once and had the ginny pizza, wow just mind-blowing. Would go back again and again. Service was great, and they have some nice wines."}
{"text":"The pizza was \"okay\" I ordered a veggie pizza because I'm vegetarian and my friends are not. My pizza was fine no issues. But my friends ordered a couple of minutes after me and they waited almost an hour and still no pizza. For some reason the pizza is cooked next door at the bar and the pizza place is just a young girl with a cash register and some tables. After asking multiple times they came to bring the pizza of people that had ordered AFTER us. The woman who brought it said \"the ticket never printed on the other side.\" Not a hint of apology that you might expect for a mistake obviously on their end. All she said as she was standing with her body halfway out the front door was \"I can give you your money back or the pizza I can't give you both.\" The nerve to treat us like we wanted something for nothing, all of us in our group are professional people and no one asked them for a handout maybe just some courtesy and respect for our time. We opted for the money back. Horrible service."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places we've ordered from!  We've probably ordered from Naked Pizza now 8 or 9 times. Always the same great quality!  We usually order via Postmates or Uber Eats. If you're looking for great pizza delivery you should try this place out!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside appearance shy you away. My husband and I always make this part of our \"to-do\" list anytime going to or passing through Vegas. BEST pizza and wings around. We usually order the Guinea Pie Pizza and \"hot\" wings (no fries)   Our recent trip the pizza was in its own area (not sharing with the bar) which was nice since we didn't have to eat while breathing in all the smoke. This place is two   thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Place went downhill. We literally waited an hour for a burnt pizza with no apology whatsoever. They are losing care and obviously quality."}
{"text":"Had the Back Home and added some red peppers. Delicious. Would definitely do it again. Toppings and sauce were great but the kicker for me was the garlic crust. Great taste to finish a slice. Loved the meaty, saucy thicker style for a change of pace.  Had already eaten but stopped in because it was close to our hotel and a chance to hit another DDD place. Besides, who doesn't have room for a little pizza?   Fun and funky little place. Retail pizza place (kid friendly) is next to the dive bar. Definitely glad we stopped and will definitely go back and try other pies. Service was very good and so were the prices.  Overall it was a 5 for the combination of great pizza, good service and fun/adventure. Do it."}
{"text":"I was excited to try them after seeing them on diners, drive-ins and dives. Called several times and there was no answer. Finally someone picked up and put me on hold. I waited in hold for 7 minutes and could hear them talking to other customers about Dallas and the football game Thursday. I just waited and waited. Finally hung up to call back but it was still busy cause \"I\" was on hold on the other line and no one hung up. Wish I would've gotten a chance to try them."}
{"text":"I wanted to try Poutine for my first time and this place is the only place I found that serves Poutine. Las Vegas magazine also mentioned this place as the best place for Poutine. The pictures looked amazing too  I ordered the stuffed mushrooms and of course Poutine. The stuffed mushrooms were tiny and it had way too much seasoning. As for my Poutine, it didn't look at all like the pictures people posted. I don't know if it was because the chef was having a bad day... but it was not smothered in gravy and there were barely any cheese curds! I tasted it and it also had too much seasoning. Pretty disappointed.  Btw, this place is inside Moon Doggies. I was lost trying to find this location."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Best Sicilian style pizza in Las Vegas by far. Get the naked city and add meatballs. Meatballs and sausage are made in house and you will be able to tell immediately. Hardcore!!! Slayer on juke box while writing this!!"}
{"text":"I was on a groupon mission this weekend! I came here with a friend to try out a new pizza spot. After reading the previous reviews I was a lil worried about the pizza being undercooked. Sadly my pizza was a little burnt on the bottom...if it wasn't this would have easily been a 4 star review!   We got the pizza to go, as we were feeling lazy! The bar was a dive bar and not as sketchy as I thought it was going to be. The guys that worked the pizza spot were super nice. The pizza was good...we got a caesar salad and the dressing was AMAZING!!! I'd go back if was near by...it's worth a try..."}
{"text":"Average at best. I was shocked that Triple D paid this place a visit. We came here on our last meal in Vegas after eating at incredible places-so maybe that's why we weren't impressed. We ordered a fourth of the square pizza with garlic and sesame seed crust, mushrooms and tomatoes. The pizza was okay but nothing that would entice me to return. The place was a  divey bar--that's fine. But ordering drinks was time consuming. I would suggest stream-lining the process."}
{"text":"Came hear after driving past it on a regular basis. Was unable to go in previously as usually had my kid w me and it's in a dive bar. Went on a whim after working out. What else does one do after they've hit the gym? Go to Naked City of course!  Ordered and was hungry so got a bit too much food. I'm not a pizza person but did get a sheet in the event I became a fan. ordered the buffy wings which were wicked and the stinger taco which was also goooood.   From what I was told the pizza was good but a wee bit too doughy. Have had wings again and were just as good.  It took about 1.5 hours for my order so sat @ the bar. Was supposed to take 45 min. Luckily the beer was cold and the bar dimly lit."}
{"text":"Just picked up this pizza and eating for the first time, totally my style with lots of crunchy crust and great tasting sauce. Best part is I live down the street so will be ordering this all the time now !!"}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza just like on DDD! Our server was very sweet and helpful. The pizza was cooked perfectly and the white sauce was delicious! We will be back the next time we are in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Yes this is in a bar you are not mistaken! Pros-Pizza was great, and the heavy male server was super nice. However the suicide fries that are highly recommended may have been good if I could feel my face again after the first bite! Soooo hot!! The waitress (prior to mr. nice server guy) didn't warn us. They did take it off the bill since we couldn't eat them. Good deal.  Cons- The place is a total dive bar and is smoky on the inside. It was early and I didn't feel nervous but I bet the night crowd could be a little...um...less than nice. I admit I'm a non-smoker, so waaahhh, but if you don't want smoke in your pizza taste - get it to go."}
{"text":"Note to self: next time I go to a place called a \"sandwich shop,\" maybe I should order a sandwich?!  Actually, my \"Naked Chop\" aka a chopped salad with turkey, greens, carrot, tomato, onion, and avocado wan't bad... it didn't blow me away either.  And it took awhile to make!    I was with Misti Y and we came here straight from the airport.  I must've worked up quite an appetite flying in from LA, because I was pretty hungry when we arrived... but I felt like a salad, so that's what I ordered.  It just wasn't the most filling salad around.  Hence, my \"note to self\" above...  I'd give this place another shot and I suggest you do if you're in the hood, but take my advice - order a sandwich, not a salad!"}
{"text":"This place is located on Arville and Desert Inn.  The pizza here is made from scratch down to the sausages and meatballs, and the quality is great.  We stopped by yesterday. The music was loud for me but it is a dive bar-like and mostly college crowd. There is a window next to the bar where you make your order and they bring it to your table. It was quite a wait but worth it as it was freshly prepared.  We built our own medium pizza with our choice of toppings: mozarella, pepperoni, mushroom, and bacon. It's not only crunchy, light and airy but hearty. There was so much leftover. I didn't have room for Suicide fries or Wings. Prices aren't bad.  There are numerous topping choices to choose from as well as some specialty pizzas. Don't be misled by the location or the interior or exterior decor."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, I was hesitant to check this place out, but I sure am glad I did!  When I arrived, there were about three cop cars parked outside ...at noon.  It just made this dive bar look really sketch.  But maybe all that reluctance built up my appetite, because we ordered everything: wings, a pie that's served on a tray the size of a cookie sheet, fries, and a beer tower.  Needless to say, all that good stuff has left us coming back for more.    The pizza is full of flavor and craft, and is cooked to perfection.  While the pizza is large, it doesn't fold over bc of heavy toppings, and you don't lose toppings dripping off your slice as well.  Such things matter; try and taste for yourself!"}
{"text":"So I was extremely excited to try this place but was so very disappointed. The sign and curb appeal was weak and I could barely find the place.  When I went in the actual restaurant, there was no one in the store(customers and staff) for over 10 mins. I had to call the location phone number on the menu for someone to tell me that the staff and food was next door in a bar with a different name other than a Naked City Pizza. When I walked in the waitress only acknowledged that I was the person that just called. I sat at a table for 20 minutes or more without a single hello. But the table of 5 next to us got a check and to go boxes all while I was sitting there. At one point the waitress made eye contact with me but didn't speak or even smile. I didn't get a goodbye when I got up and left either. Too bad I didn't get to try the food I was so excited to try. Maybe I'll just try the other location next time. Service at this location was terrible!"}
{"text":"After once again searching Yelp for some of the higher reviewed places near where I live I found the Naked City Pizza Shop.    The pizza shop is located inside of the Moon Doggies bar.  It's not even sectioned off like a Subway inside of a convenience store, it's really just a window in the wall.  It can be quite difficult to find if you've never been there before -- it's on the northeast corner of Arville and Desert Inn.  The bar itself seems to have bar seats for 15 people and small tables & high chairs for another 15.  It's the epitome of a dive bar but it seems to be clean enough.  Aside from the video poker at the bar, there's a golf arcade game, a hunting arcade game, an electronic dartboard, and one of those punching bag games.  Smoking is allowed everywhere, if that's make-or-break for you.  I came with a friend around 1:30 PM on a Tuesday and obviously there was little traffic.  The guy running the shop was really nice and attentive.  Huge bonus points for that, although some of the other reviews talk about bad or slow service so your mileage may vary.  We decided to try a little bit of everything and planned on taking quite a bit home with us.  Like other reviewers note, whether or not you eat there, everything is served in the styrofoam takeout containers.  If you eat there you do get some plates and plastic cutlery though.  We got some single slices of pepperoni pizza, a ham sub, seasoned fries, garlic buns, suicide wings, and fried dough.  Even a single slice of the pizza is huge and tastes great with a good sauce, great cheese, and superb dough.  I believe they call it Brooklyn style but all I know is it was great.  The pizza reminded me of Pizza Hut when I was a kid.  I don't mean in terms of taste or quality, but for me it was always a treat to get to go to Pizza Hut as a kid.  Nowadays I find their pizza quite bland, perhaps because my taste buds have changed, perhaps because their ingredients have changed.   Anyway Naked City's pizza gives me that same feeling as when I was a kid.  The ham sub has a lot of ham and a lot of cheese in it, and the bun of the sub is toasted, but it's just like something you would make from stuff you got in the store.   I would imagine some of the heated subs using their pizza ingredients are better.  The fries were great.  Done perfectly, and even the small for $2 filled up an entire styrofoam container.  The garlic buns are like garlic bread with cheese, served with marinara (which Naked City calls 'red sauce' on their menu).  Absolutely delicious with the bubbly browned cheese.  The wings themselves are large but nothing special.  The suicide hot sauce is quite messy but very hot.  The fried dough was quite good and covered in chocolate sauce.  It, like pretty much everything else, filled up a single styrofoam container but it wasn't \"heavy\" as far as desserts go.    The chef/server was really nice and as I mentioned above service was fairly fast.  Even though we ordered the dessert along with everything else he said he would bring it out a while after we had gotten the rest of our food and he even brought over a pitcher of soda for us so we wouldn't have to ask for a bunch of refills.  I'll be honest, I think the quality of service at most places in Vegas ranges from average to terrible, but this was top notch.  Overall, I'm a bit torn.  The food is great quality, huge portions, and very cheap.  The location leaves a lot to be desired though. I get the feeling that such good pizza and sides are almost wasted on the patrons of a bar when it deserves to be in a restaurant on its own.  This is definitely a diamond in the rough.   I'll probably go on my own again, get takeout, or order delivery, but it's pretty unlikely I'd take a group of friends or my family there."}
{"text":"I went to this location because it was recommended to me by a bunch of people and I have to say they were right, it's really good. I'm from NY and miss the pizza and this fulfilled my craving. It's more upstate NY style not thin city style. It has great flavor lots of toppings when ordered and the cheese is stretching off each slice they are not cheap with their toppings at all. And I have to say the girl Nicole that works there was extremely friendly and makes an awesome pizza, great customer service."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in Las Vegas. This place is a classic dive bar and pizza joint. Food is fantastic, the pizza is off the charts. You can eat on site or take out. And you can smoke at the bar while you eat which is a rarity these days.  As far as the pizza goes...try the Guinea, it's phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Super sad they don't make sausage sandwiches anymore.  They got awards for them for goodness sake!!!!! They still have sausages,  and they still make sandwiches.... what's up,  Naked City???? You got rid of lobster pasta at the tavern,  then closed the tavern,  and now I can't even get a sausage sandwich??????"}
{"text":"Saw this place on TV and decided to try it out. If you like the dive bar atmosphere then this is thr place for you. Great food, cheap drinks, and great service."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best.   I realize when talking pizza, not everyone has the same likes and preferences. The crust wasn't my favorite, very thick, but not awful. The sauce gave me heartburn so that wasn't fun, but my least favorite part of the pizza was the oh so important cheese. I really wasn't expecting such low quality cheese, I mean for the price I was under the impression the pizza here was a step above \"pizza hut\" but really I'd rather just buy $5 pizza at Little Caesars. The wings were good, nice flavor and cooked just right. Customer service was decent.  I like the location of this pizza joint, definitely very hole in the wall and loud but not too loud.  I doubt I'll buy pizza here again, but maybe wings."}
{"text":"peppers were blastingly hot and made me want to kill myself"}
{"text":"Great food!  Tried the mild wings and the Frickin huge margarita pizza - flavor was great, portions matched the name. Teresa made us feel welcome and guided us well. Diners drive ins and dives served us well."}
{"text":"Took 1 star away for dinning area. Could be kept cleaner. Now for that PIZZA! IT WAS GREAT! Crisp crust, plenty of toppings sauce is PERFECT!"}
{"text":"Purchase to-go pizza for my crew at lunch last week.  There was a power outage, but they still managed to get the pizzas ready and on time with their gas ovens and cell phones for lights!  Great pizza !   All the boys loved it.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I ordered food from here while visiting Vegas through Uber eats. The food came quickly, it was hot, and the order had what I needed. The pizza slice was the right size for the price and cheeezzzzzyyyyyyy :) the wings were great and the extra blue cheese dressings was all there as requested. Not one complaint from me! I'll have it next time I visit too"}
{"text":"Pizza is to die for....nothing better than a run down smokey bar full of hooked and booze.lol jk..  but Seriossly it's amazing pizza"}
{"text":"After driving for hours to Vegas, pizza sounded pretty good. A friend really wanted to come here, so we decided to try this place out. Located inside of Moondoggie's Bar, this dimly-lit dive bar/restaurant was a little intimidating to walk in to. After being seated, service was definitely slow. Our orders weren't taken for quite some time. Also, food took a long time to be made, even though it wasn't very crowded. Only one other couple was eating in the dining area, and there were only a handful of people sitting at the bar. Our server spent the majority of her time helping the customers at the bar.  Food: - Chicken, Mushroom, and Spinach Pie - This rectangular-shaped pizza had plenty of chicken, though there could have been more mushrooms and spinach. Ingredients weren't very well distributed on the corner pieces. The dough is pretty heavy, so it's quite filling. - Garlic Fries - Fresh garlic, parmesan cheese, and parsley. Pretty good and a decent size."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the $41 Pizza I just got they should have put a sign reading this $41 Pizza may be hazardous to your eyesight you will hurt your eyes looking for the meat on the pizza the last pizza I ordered like this had a tremendous amount of meat and pepperoni and sausage this one was very disappointing so I won't be coming back the owner of McDonald's once said if you're going to make a bad hamburger make it bad all the time that way at least your customer knows what they're getting too inconsistent with the pizzas very sad Guy Fieri would be very disappointed I hope everyone that orders their guess what they pay for I sure didn't"}
{"text":"This place presents me with way too many moral dilemmas than I'm prepared to face over the course of one meal. It's every bit as wonderful and decadent as you might have heard, and you're probably going to obliterate any notion of health consciousness you may have once had just to get through.  For one, I can't come here without ordering the suicide fries. I love spicy food, and these fries speak to me in ways that most places that boast spicy dishes could ever begin to understand. The fries are crisp and awesome, drenched in a truly hot sauce. The problem here is that I can't hardly justify eating a mound of fries when I know I'm gonna have pizza. They just give you so many fries, even with the small order. It's a dilemma because I don't let myself come here very often because I don't want to gain a hundred pounds, so when I do visit, I've got to have pizza , and I've absolutely got to have fries. Also, I don't like to waste food, so you see the beginning of my problems.  Then the pizza is massive, covered in cheese... I'm full after just a few slices, and my wife is never any help. Dough is light and tastes surprisingly fresh. It's so good I usually push myself to eat more when I know I shouldn't.  I just can't hang with this place.  Atmosphere can be relaxed sometimes when there isn't a crowd, but being that it's located in a dive bar, you just never know what kind of crowd you're going to get. Definitely not a place for a quiet dinner... Or a dieter."}
{"text":"EPIC pizza hidden inside Moon Doggies off Arville And Desert Inn. Pizza Aficionados welcome, and bring an appetite. I nominate the Guinea Pie for best white pizza of the year. ''Please cast your vote by clicking the cool icon''.   The Pizza here is made from scratch down to the meatballs, and the quality is noticeable. Due to this added quality assurance protocol and time honored method of ''Freshly prepared,'' you may have to wait for your food. Be prepared for a lengthy wait, though it is well worth it. Prices also reflect quality, but again the increase is worth it, and I will say a mediocre increase considering the taste and quality are exceptional.  Here you order your pizza by the sheet. 1/4 of a sheet was more then enough to feed 2 friends and myself, and half a sheet should keep your fridge well stocked with delicious cold pizza leftovers. A whole sheet? I dare not order it. That's cold pizza for a week! Think of it as the birthday party pizza.   Suicide Fries = HOT FRIES. I like hot, and the sauce on these should not disappoint unless you inhale Ghost peppers by the handful, then you sir are the exception.   The added plus of being located in a bar is the drinking options. You have plenty of beer and hard liquor choices to cover all bases. Enjoy your epic pizza!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go and had a delivery service bring it to me, ordered hot Sicilian wings, margarita pizza and the cheese stuffed peppers. The pizza was super thick soft doughy with hardly any cheese and sauce, the wings were not what I had ordered they were the normal Sicilian wings not hot and they were bland and flavorless. The pepper was just ok. But to top it all off they gave us no napkins no forks. It was just a terrible experience I will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"For all you Triple D Fan's don't bring your kids. I went here to try another spot on the Triple D list and I'm starting to doubt Guy's taste bud's, he is 50/50 so far in my book. Drove into town looking to try a good eating spot. Went here with family and got a big surprise once we got there. It's a bar/lounge nothing for the Fam. Being from the Windy City I know good pizza. I felt like we ordered a hot n ready from Little Caesar's. It wasn't nasty but it will not get any recommendations from me.  When I got there it was a guy out front drinking a beer, he said he owned two tattoo shops, and he was pumping the place up saying, everything was good. Hahaha it amazes me how different people taste's are telling them something is good versus what is really good. I'm totally convinced that if there were a taste test to prove that some foods are not as good as others, I think a lot of people would like the crap food over the good flavorful foods.   I also ordered the wings with all the sauces I like my sauce on the side so I can actually taste the wings and my wings were dry and brittle. The sauces were typical. I get better wings at Buffalo Wild Wings and sauces to.   The fries were rubbery and soft nothing to brag about, I was really disappointed with my order, but I'm sure it's hit or miss when you do take out, but nothing can save that pizza flavor, it doesn't matter if the pizza is cold or hot when it's good it's good, and this pizza needs some more flavor added to it.   Other posts on here mentioned the staff and I had a little blond help me with my order and she was making me feel like I was asking for to much when I asked for more Ketchup. She wasn't pleasant at all. Oh and speaking of the ketchup. I heard they make their own, they should stick to buying it from the market. Not at all impressed with the watered down taste.   I may try this place some other time to see if it will be better dinning in. But for now based on the amateur Pizza, dry ass wings and lack luster fries this place is getting Two Stars."}
{"text":"How does this place only have 3 stars? Yes the place is a little divey actually a lot and the service is sub-par and they give you warm water. But how doesn't the back home or guniea pizza pie make up for it...some of the best pizza in Vegas! Cheap brews large domestic around 3 bucks, nice laid back atmosphere. Great place to get a couple drinks before you hit the strip or head downtown. I set the record on the boxing machine 967 so umm good luck to everyone on that."}
{"text":"I've come full circle.  This was actually the very first review I gave on Yelp, warranted by a terrible experience I had here.  I was very reluctant and stubborn to try this place again, but my husband finally convinced me to.  Naked City has been redeemed by its food.  The food is really great here.  The poutine fries were something I had never tried/heard of before, but were super tasty.  I have tried two of their pasta specials, which have very interesting and surprising ingredients like crab and butternut squash pieces.  And the pizza is doughy and flavorful.  I like the food a lot, I'll give them that.  BBBBUUUUTTTT.  I still absolutely hate the fact that this place is inside Moondoggies Bar.  That bar is a disgusting, dark, cigarette-smoke filled, urine-reeking bathroom, dingy place.  I do not like trying to eat my yummy food in that place.  How do they get away with having the restaurant in a smoky bar anyway?  Didn't they pass a law that says you can't smoke where there's food?  Naked City needs to get its own building to make it more welcoming and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Dive bar. A lot of bikers. But pizza is very good and good poutine. Service is very good as well.   Everybody is very friendly.  Kim is the best bartender. So awesome and  customer oriented."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We found out about it by watching the Food Network, and of course we had to go! This is our 3rd time going! They have a family side if you don't want to sit on the bar side! (which tends to be loud and smokey) We are OBSESSED with the Atomic Fries! We are making this our regular pizza joint!  The pizza is amazing and is square cut so lots of crust!! We also ordered the meatball skillet which was super yummy! Cant go wrong with anything you choose!!"}
{"text":"pizza was good, but there was a giant bubble on the corner that should have popped during the baking process. cheap beers and the pizza isn't expensive either. separate bills is a little annoying,  I'm sure it is forthe server as well. not too smoky, but we still smelled like smoke when we left. will go again. oh, yeah, pepperoni bowls of grease."}
{"text":"This little gem is located inside MoonDoggie's Bar on the left toward the back of the bar. For a pizza joint to be open until 3am, this is just what I need in the middle of the night when I can't head over to Amore's Taste of Chicago.  I ordered a pepperoni pizza, just a half sheet, for two of us. This was PLENTY of food, and we ended up bringing half of it home. The pizza was only like $15 and was ready quickly. The bartender at MoonDoggie's was also really friendly, though his personal selection of music from his iPod varied from heavy metal to R&B music lol.  I would have rated the pizza a 7 out of 10 (with 5 being an average pizza). The dough was great, the pepperoni was great, but the cheese was where they missed. The cheese was tasteless and I had to add a little bit of salt and peppers to give the pizza that zing that I was looking for.  I'll definitely be back to Naked City Pizza for a pie."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza and nuclear fries. Fries are really REALLY hot. Pizza was dry. Needed more sauce. We ordered carry out so I can't say anything about the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"Just went back this weekend, better than I remembered..Grimaldi's who??? All about the guinea pie, my favorite with some serious meat balls on it....Love this place!"}
{"text":"I live close to this place so i drive by all the time, looked interesting. As far as being the best pizza in Las Vegas is not true by any means. Thick crust plenty of cheese but ultimately  BLAND, also the toppings few and far between.  I dont know."}
{"text":"I saw this place advertised in our weekly Mail newspaper thingie and always kept it in the back of my mind to try.  It's Buffalo style pizza (thick slightly sweet, yeasty crust) a buttload metric ton of cheese and little spicy pepperoni that curls up and holds the grease for ya. Being from near Buffalo this is a taste of near home.  If you are from Upstate or Western NY get your butt here!!  Even if you are not from NY, you'll live this pizza. We have been a couple times and brought friends. It's our go to pizza place. Yes, the puzza take awhile but they are done right!! We recently ventured into the appetizer portion of the menu...  Seasoned fries. Delicious!!  Do you know what a pizza log is? Usually it's this totally crappy yet weirdly addictive frozen egg roll looking thing filled with cheese and pepperoni and deep fried and the grease squirts out the end and gets your date in the eye and leaves a big grease stain on your shirt. I haven't had one in a long time so I decided to get pizza logs. Well...um...these are legit homemade and now we will ALWAYS order those and a pizza.  Hint: the best left over pizza I ever had was their white pizza. Mmmmm  Go here.  Do it now.  Why are you still reading this? Get in your hooptie and go!!!  P.S. It's a buffalo bills bar!  Don't wear a dolphin jersey here!"}
{"text":"Ok first off, this place is KNOWN for being in a dive bar so get over that right off the bat. (You'll be glad you did!) Featured on Triple D with Guy Fieri we just had to stop in and we were SO glad we did!  The Guinea - 5 stars. My husband is somewhat of a pizza connoisseur and let me tell you, he was speechless; fist pumping with every bite. Needless to say, we'll be back."}
{"text":"So my experience with the menu is somewhat limited - I've had the poutine twice and I had their sub of the month about a week ago.   The sub was pretty bland which is hard to do with a hot wing themed sub.  As for the poutine, I struggle to review it. I'd actually classify it closer to a cheese fries and gravy than a poutine. If you've eaten at a diner in NY or NJ, you've had this dish... fries with some sliced cheese melted over the top and brown gravy. While the flavor was decent (good gravy which is important) the fries definitely needed to be more well done - a good poutine needs crispy fries in my opinion. That said, this also isn't what I would consider to be poutine. A true poutine has nice cheesy curds located throughout like nuggets of gold that you discover and cherish like pirate's booty....  Good, not great, but when I'm lookin' for a fix, I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was very excited to hear that one of my favorite sandwich shops was opening a Pizza joint.  So there was no way I was going to miss out on the first day they open.  I worked out for 2 hrs in the morning in anticipation of the calories I planned to consume...ha!  The restaurant is located inside Moondoggies video poker bar.  I was pleased to see that the menu was much larger than their sandwich shop....so I went big and ordered a Slice of Cheese, Slice of Pepperoni, Slice of the Pie of the Day (Royal, see menu pics for details), and an order of 3 Chicken Fingers.  The Pizza came out first.  I tried the Cheese Slice first.  It is a thick crust.  The menu calls it Buffalo, NY Style Pizza....I've  never had this style before.  The pizza is loaded with Cheese....the crust is soft and doughy, not how I usually prefer my Pizza but it was good.  There is a good proportion of sauce.  The second slice I had was the Pepperoni.  It has the small slices of Pepperoni and the best part is that the Pepperoni is slightly burnt...+1 in my book.  Again, good proportion of sauce and cheese.  Nice zing to the Pepperoni too.  The third slice was the Royal, which was the best of the 3....no wonder it was the Pie of the Day!  Cappicola Ham, Italian Sausage, Mozzarella, and Ricotta goodness all in one Pizza Pie!!!!  The meats are very tasty and fresh....this combo went well together.  I am glad I splurged and went for it.  The last thing to come out was the Chicken Fingers....they were good, not great. The sauce was Mild and the appropriate spice level.  The fingers were not the crispy style, but the soaked chewy style.  It was ok.  Moondoggies is an older bar, so don't expect a great atmosphere....it's a video poker bar and it is not in the suburbs....and hasn't been Gentrified....yet. ;-)  Will I return?  You bet your Naked Heiney I will!!! I want to try some of the other Pies and definitely the other Subs that they don't have at their Sandwich Shop."}
{"text":"Not living in the Buffalo area anymore there are certain thing you miss. CHICKEN FINGER SUBS!!!! My wife and I both order one, because neither one of us wanted to share. It was awesome. Bartenders are awesome and great music on the box. Felt like we were back at the Pink on Allen St. Worth the 4 hour flight!!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza and wings.  I don't typically like wings but someone else had ordered them so I tried them and they are very good.  This is my favorite pizza spot in Vegas so far.  I went to the one on Paradise as well, but the service wasn't as good."}
{"text":"This is based on take out only. Place looks like a dump but the pizzas are really good. Not the greatest part of town but the pizza are really good....lol"}
{"text":"I have to remind myself that this is bar and I am rating bar food. So I kinda feel silly because it is bar food, so maybe I shouldn't be so harsh? I came primarily to try the poutine fries, but of course also ordered a pizza. We placed our poutine fry order, and it took 30 minutes for them to come out, it was a small order and we were the only people in the dining area. Our server was always coming around checking on us, so I know it wasn't her fault for the delay, so we couldn't really figure it out. Was a little strange to get your app at the same time as the meal. As for the pizza, it is Sicilian style (rectangular) which I'm not a huge fan of because I like crust, so you have an entire mid section of pizza that is all alone because I eat around it. We ordered half margherita and half back home. When the pizza came out it looked good, but as I got a couple bites in, it started to taste gross. They bake the pizza with the basil on it instead of putting it on after, so the basil is wilted and burnt, the tomatoes tasted canned and the cheese was gross to look at after 15 minutes, it became hard and formed, and the crust had an overwhelming taste of yeast, clearly not quality ingredients. Again, I realize I'm at a bar. My stomach has been a little upset since I ate. The two things this place has going for them is the Pandora station they play and the poutine fries, but I'd never come back and wait 30 minutes for them."}
{"text":"I would never even have given this place a second look had I not seen it on Triple D. I decided to try it because I figured it would not be on the show if it wasn't any good. It was only alright. First of all, it is definitely a bar. It looks like a strip club on the outside and when you walk in, its dark and smokey. I'm not really a bar guy so I kinda felt out of my element. I will say however, the staff was really polite and helped me get what I needed. I ordered the Naked City Pizza and an order of Suicide Fries.  The pizza was only okay, but the fries were delicious!. I loved the creaminess of the buttermilk sauce and the spice of the suicide sauce!   In the end, it was okay but there are better places with a more comfortable atmosphere. Not for people like me but not bad."}
{"text":"Good people. Good food.  However: I once ordered pizza, and requested that the crust be made \"thinner than usual\".  The response was \"grunt...ok...i'll try...grunt\". Well it was still way too thick...and bready. It must be a Buffalo thing.  They're not good at posting their specials online, either on facebook or their website, so you have to call or visit to figure out what the daily special is. I've been wanting to try one of their \"Turducken  Burgers\", but I can never figure out when they're available. It must be a Buffalo thing.  After this review, the next time i go in, they'll probably kick my ass. That's definitely a Buffalo thing.  (I'll wear a disguise.)"}
{"text":"Everytime I come to vegas which is very often Naked City is or shall I say was a must! I literally would buy some while staying and then buy more to take home. I rant and rave about Naked City. This last visit I took  6 people with me we ordered 1/2 sheet sausage and mushroom, anothet pizza, Italian doughnuts, and wings. Not only was the pizza maker/cashier soo rude, but my pizza was horrible. Hardly any toppings, pizza looked dry, the nastiest part is the doughnuts smelt so bad. Like if the oil they were cooked in hadn't been cleaned and was old. My whole car filled with the smell. Came back to the hotel and looked them over. Gross. Threw them away. I had never ordered the doughnuts and when I asked the cashier pizza guy if he's had them he said no with no smile no expression, as if I was irritating him. Then he said they are  doughnuts with powdered sugar and rolled his eyes and his attitude and tone were extremely rude. Fast forward when we get back to the hotel , open the boxes, and realize the food looked disappointing. I was so embarrassed. Everyone I was with started talking about the horrible quality and taste. I called the next day and asked for the manager, no manager was available and the person in charge didn't give a  darn about the awful experience...total disappointment."}
{"text":"the first part of the review is for their ordering system(s) or lack thereof.  about a month ago i tried to order takeout  by calling to place an order.  the phone rang and rang and rang with no answer.  next try i used their \"on-line\" ordering system.  i ordered and showed up a half hour later only to be told that the cook never got the order because whoever received the order didn't relay it to him. maybe instead of spending time on NPR critiquing other pizza places in town, the owner of naked city pizza should take care of his own house. 0 stars  alas, i finally tried the pizza.  it wasn't terrible but i had big expectations based on numerous reviews and a fair amount of self promotion.  i'll start with the good.  they certainly use a decent quality cheese that melts nicely and has good flavor.  the pizza was also cooked properly.  now for the not so good sarting with the crust.  i'm sure there are many people that like this type of crust.  i'm not one of them.  it's really just a white bread dough recipe.  too much of a \"gut-bomb\".  i also prefer a sauce that is a little spicier and has a richer tomato flavor.  i also prefer one that is sans bay leaves.  finally, the toppings are too skimmpy for this thicker, heartier style of pizza.  2 stars."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. It's a total dive... located inside a little bar on Arville near Chinatown. Don't expect your dining experience to be glamorous. Also, we were very confused as to how it worked- we didn't know we could get a waitress, so we stood at the window waiting for someone to help us. They were short staffed, but the waitress was very good to us- she even took time out of her busy day to take a picture of my friend and I by wall of shame they have.  Now, about the food.... It's really out of this world. We tried to the buffalo chicken dip- superb. I really loved it. It comes with hunks of fried chicken fingers in it, with plenty of pieces of their yummy flatbread for dipping. And the pizza... oh my gosh, really really good. We got the Back HOme pie, topped with their housemade sausage and yummy pepperoni. It was mind blowingly amazing.  I washed it down with a 2.25 bud light- can't beat that deal. you can't beat these prices. I suggest everyone tries this place- maybe when the DDD hype is over : )"}
{"text":"We have lived right across the street from here for years and have never tried it. We heard they were on food network and they had done renovations so we finally decided to try it. It was better than we expected. It is a full bar with tables and it's 21+ only. We sat down on the tables and was greeted by the server and she right away got us water as it was 100+ degrees out. They bring a big glass bottle of filtered water to pour yourself which I thought was good so u don't have to wait for refills. We ordered the poutine fries the wee size was perfect size to share, meathead sub full size, and wee size guinea pie. All of the food was delicious! The fries were cut thick and fried perfectly, covered in brown gravy and cheese and fries weren't even soggy. The meathead sub was awesome! It's brisket with pickles, mustard and melted cheddar cheese. All the flavors melted together perfectly, they put a good amount of meat and the brisket was super moist and juicy, even the sub bead they used was crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. The pizza was rectangle and cut into 6 pieces we could only eat 2 bcuz we were so full. The pizza had spinach, ricotta, mozzarella, slices of sausage meatball, and garlic cream sauce. The crust on it's own was great, it was like having a soft chewy breadstick at the end, perfect for dipping. Food came out pretty fast but there werent too many ppl ordering food at the time. The waitress was attentive and helpful with the menu. I'm pretty sure we'll become regulars lol"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place on DD&D, I was really looking forward to trying a new pizza place. Unfortunately, my experience was less than stellar. We came in on a Thursday night to a bar that was, at best, 40% filled. It took 15 minutes for the waitress to even come over and take our drink order (not for lack of trying to get her attention) and another 20 just to get our drinks. Considering we ordered a water and a soda, I was a little disappointed. When the pizza finally arrived, it was a little greasey. My friend got a standard pizza (pepperoni), and I got one of their specialty pies. He was disappointed but I thought the pizza was pretty decent. I just would have liked a refill on my water without having to ask the waitress three times. I worked in food service for many years, so I understand that things can happen. But if that's the wait time on a slow Thursday night, I would hate to be there on a weekend.  Overall -- respectable pizza, service that left something to be desired. Probably worth giving a second chance, though."}
{"text":"Some damm great pizza here. Ive been a few times and always found the atmosphere very inviting and positive energy"}
{"text":"Decent pizza, but nothing more. It is definitely a dive. I think the Food Network should take this place off their site, since the food is not really special. The cheese is good, but the sauce is average, and so is the case for the crust. Wouldn't come back when I visit Vegas, considering the location is out of the way."}
{"text":"A great pizza, unfortunately it's located in a really, really divey bar (Moon Doggies) with music so loud it makes it hard to think. Everytime the music paused for whatever reason it was such a relief!   Loud music aside, the pizza was pretty good. The lots of cheese and a slightly tangy, tasty sauce. The crust was not thin and crispy, which is ok by me. It was yeasty and chewy. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to sample any of the sandwiches or fries, not sure if I will be able anytime soon, need to let my hearing return.  The one saving grace of the atmosphere were the bathrooms, sometimes 2 people would go in and one lady would come out or vice versa. The permutations were mind boggling!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PIZZA!!!! We NEVER leave Vegas without stopping here for pizza, wings, and fries! Located inside Moon Doggie's Bar ( Bills fans) means you can get some of the best drinks in town as well. We've told several family and friends about this \"hidden treasure\" and it has also become their tradition to visit before leaving Vegas. Our eldest child, our Son now makes this a tradition as well when he visits Vegas with friends.  You should definitely stop in, order your pizza, fries, and wings. While you wait for your food to be prepared hot and fresh, order a couple shots, a drink, and enjoy your visit! You'll definitely make it a tradition too!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying if you don't want to eat at a bar, try another location. That being said, I'm from Buffalo and this place does it right! We went today for lunch because I needed to try the Beef on Weck, a Buffalo favorite that's right up there with wings and it was great! The kimmelweck rolls were perfect and they served it with horseradish, it took me back home. The wings were spot on and the only negative for me was they were served with fries instead of carrots and celery and I prefer a different kind of blue cheese, just my preference. Unfortunately I cannot comment on the pizza because I was too full to even take a bite but it did look good! One more thing, the people who took care of us, I'm sorry I didn't get their names, were so nice and got us all the extras we asked for with a smile. I'll definitely be back for the pizza next time, hopefully for a Bills game!"}
{"text":"The Pizza was delicious.  It came delivered in an extra large mutant rectangular box.  We ate the pizza over at the Double Down Saloon.  So we had the guy from diners dives and drive ins' pizza at Anthony Bourdain's Dive Bar.  It was a fun afternoon.  Incidentally, if you go to the Double Down, have the Bacon Martini and an Ebola shot.  The pizza was so big we shared it with the bartender and our cab driver."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends for beers and grub pre-movie premeire.  We were not dissapointed.  This is some good freaking pizza! Obscenities flew out of our mouths, uncontrollably, as we feasted.  So delicious! I am sure it depends what kind of pizza you like;  I like a fluffy doughy marvelous pizza.  Some people prefer that crappy crispy cardboardy stuff.    We had the guinea pie - Chris proclaimed it was his favorite.  My favorite now too! AMAZEing.  Meatballs, ricotta, garlic, fresh mozzarella. YUM.  We also had poutine, and the pork ragu fettucini from the specials board which came with chewy, delicious garlic buns, and a zesty sald with vinaigrette.  Just to finish of our carb fest, we ordered the fried. dough.  This does not such.  Warm chocolately powdered sugary goodness.  So $32 for four people - is this a joke? Salad, pizza, buns, pasta with a pound of flavorful shredded pork, and fried dough?!?! What a deal!  I'll be back asap!"}
{"text":"IF your a pizza lover this is the only place to go. Pizza here is sooooo freaking good im not sure how they do it. Pizza, Wings, Suicide fries and pizza egg rolls are just out of control. Cheap beer as well. If u make one stop in vegas make this one it."}
{"text":"OK I tried them again.  Pizza was eh.  Nothing special and kind of expensive.  What make me angry was that they hassled me about my coupon.  If you are going to use coupons in your business you need to allow employees to enter them without needing to call a manager.  Sorry, but customer service failure."}
{"text":"The hoagies were HUGE! Fries tasted fresh ur and amazing, and the pizza is the best square pizza I've had since living in Scranton, PA. You really get what you pay for here - top notch quality.  Also, the woman behind the counter with multicolored hair was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Weird little hole in the wall.  A small plus in my book.  Despite having only one employee there our two pizzas still came out pretty quickly.  They were a bit bread-heavy but overall the flavor was pretty good.  I'd come back again, but might walk back out if there were a lot of people in there waiting on pizzas."}
{"text":"This is a great place to order one for delivery.   I am staying at the Wyndham and the pizza arrived hot and within 20 min of the order.  (Faster than I get at home)   Good quality pizza with lots of cheese and sauce.   Great Job!!"}
{"text":"Sweet jesus, I'm in love with Naked City. The pizza is thick, bubbly, and just the right amount of browned. The cannelloni was fantastical. Everything I have tried is absolutely delish! The suicide fries are not to be underestimated, bring Tums and order them! Also, they offer pizza by the slice, I got pizza and a drink for less than $5.00!  Digging this place, big time!  Note, you must be 21 to enter restaurant due to it being in a bar."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and Fingers! Ready in 20 minutes rather than 45 like most places. Easy parking to get in and out pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Must have gone on an off night. Have heard good things about the pizza here, and really wanted to like it, but the pizza dough, sauce and (veggie) toppings were all completely bland and tasteless :( YMMV..."}
{"text":"After reading some amazing reviews about this place I had to try it out.   I order a pizza and some suicide fries.   I will say I loved the fries. Just hot enough that most will want to steer clear if you don't like spicy yet hot enough that those who love heat will enjoy. I will be back here for these alone.   I will say I wasn't that impressed with the pizza. I have had better and worse in this town. I think this place might get some benefit to being a dive. It's what I call the food truck effect. Any food served from a food truck is automatically 3 to 4 times better than it actually is. Just because people like dives and loves food trucks. The pizza here is good but nothing amazing. I can see ordering pizza hear in the future but wont go out of my way for it.   Last but not least on my second visit in under a week I had the suicide wings. They were just okay as well. Where did the heat go. Would have liked these much hotter.   I say give this place a try if you like dive bars, but be warned if you take your rose colored glasses off it might just be a slightly above average place to eat."}
{"text":"We ended up not eating here being 8 months pregnant I didn't want to wait in a bar with smoke everywhere.  A family came in behind us and they left as well.  You order in a small window inside this spot.  Even though the pizza looked amazing and reviews seemed great I am disappointed we couldn't enjoy this.  This place is very dark and had loud music as well.   Not family friendly."}
{"text":"Me and my sister went there yesterday for lunch.  Both of us had the tr-tip sandwich and it was excellent.  I'm thinking of going back right now!  I'll probably change to 5 stars after a few more visits."}
{"text":"absolutely amazing food great fast service I love this place. huge pizzas for reasonable price."}
{"text":"Came here because of DDD also, but found it disappointing. The suicide fries had nothing unique on them. It could have been a jarred suicide sauce for all I knew and was not that hot. Ordered the Stinger pizza and couldn't find/taste a couple of the ingredients (blue cheese, chicken finger hot sauce). Drinks were fine. Service was slow even though they weren't that busy on a Monday night."}
{"text":"Great food best wings and pizza. Service and phone contact needs some work but all and all   because food is consistant you can tolerate the lack of personable attitudes."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. Nothing too fancy,  but it's a fun hang out when you're with friends. Located in Moon Doggies, a little dive bar, this place is super laid back. Walk in all the way to the back and order from a tiny window.  After you order, you can hang out at the bar, knock a few back and play some Deuces Wild, or take a seat at one of the tables or booths. When your order is ready, they'll bring it out to you. Paper plates, napkins,  plastic utensils, and water are all self serve near the entrance. The music is blaring, so you kinda have to be a loud conversationist. They were playing punk rock and ska when I've been.   As for the food,  the pizza isn't the greatest, but good enough for the price. The crust is thin and a little hard. They used these tiny little pepperonis that reminds me of frozen pizza.  The portions are generous, though,  and you can order their special of the day by the slice. My favorite special so far was the chicken fried steak, with chicken finger pieces (I think) and country gravy. So good! I regret not ordering a full pie...   I usually get the poutine, too, the frickin huge size (good to share with 3-4 people. I don't have anything to compare it to, but I think it's tasty. The gravy is runny, but flavorful (the cheese curds not so much).   Another item I always order is the zeppoles. Deep fried pizza dough, covered in powdered sugar :D They come stuffed in a brown paper bag (how charming) served with chocolate syrup.  I like to take them home and doctor em up. Sprinkled with cinnamon, or dipped in caramel, with a nice cuppa coffee, they're addictive. You get a lot of em, but they're best fresh,  so if you have a lot left over, just nuke em for a few seconds prior to enjoying."}
{"text":"Food was good. We had the Stinger with mild wing sauce, a touch of spice but good flavor. We also had a another pizza with meats and tomato, that was good too. The pizza is thicker then hand toss and large. Our two quarter sheets easily would feed four.  The atmosphere is unusual but clean. I recommend this with an open mind or just take it Togo."}
{"text":"Chef Chris knows what he is doing when it comes to food. Yes the pizza is great but all the food we've tried is almost too good for the concept! Not much for the area of town, however, when you walk in, the atmosphere is awesome. Not intimidating to guests and very friendly. We have eaten here many times, and it usually is a twice a month venture (which is a lot for the wife and I). Great pizza place- HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"This place located in a dive bar was amazing! The pizza can take a while to come out but it's worth the wait. Since I found it, I've gone there maybe 5 tines in a month. Bartenders are sociable and friendly. The slice of the day is the best BC its random and well you don't get the sane thing every time. Suicide fries are yunny although extra hot. I recommend you get the sauce on the side BC damn. Will be going back frequently lol."}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time I come up to Vegas I have to stop here and have a Native and some suicide fries. It never gets old. The last time I was here I had their poutine for the first time. I will make sure I always order it again. I love that this place is in a locals bar. The food is amazing. You won't order a bad a thing on the menu I promise."}
{"text":"Nailed it.  We started with the wings - let me just say they nailed it.  Great wing sauce (we had the hot) and the homemade blue cheese was delicious.  Went with the Naked City Pie - very good.  The dough had a nice chew and the over-all flavor - very very good. I was traveling with a colleague from upstate NY and he signed off on everything also being quite good.  He was dumbfounded as to how good the wings were...and is argue he's an expert...lol. I'm so sorry I neglected to take a few photos - I'd highly recommend!!  I'll be back for sure on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I love the dive bar that it is in. The bartenders were nice and the guy working the pizza shop was nice also.   We started out with the stuffed mushrooms and the pepperoni egg rolls.  The mushrooms were stuffed with delicious house made sausage and served with bell pepper ranch dipping sauce, very good.  The egg rolls were stuffed with pepperoni and mozzarella cheese in an egg roll wrapper and then deep fried.  They were good, but nothing special.   We got two types of pizza. The first was the guineas pie.  Meatballs, spinach, white garlic sauce, and ricotta.  The second was the bacon and egg pizza with arugula, pancetta, white sauce, and brown eggs.  Both pizzas were good, at least the toppings were.  The thing I don't like about the pizzas was the crust.  It just didn't have enough flavor.  Very bland and chewy, needed salt. The meatballs had a lot of flavor and so did the white sauce. The bacon and egg pizza was the best with the salty pancetta and the arugula.   Overall very good meal, I will go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I love to try new pizza places. We went a few days ago to Naked City Pizza Shop and paid $45 for a salad, appetizer, and two 12\" pizzas. We were hesitant, but we decided to give it a try... The crust was horrible!... I don't know what they're doing, but it tastes like frozen pizza. The pepperoni is so small and looks odd. We won't go there again. The food is bad and overpriced."}
{"text":"The pizza is great the poutine French fries are to die for, but be prepared the service is the worst i have ever have in my life take thw pizza home u dont wanna be there waiting for service that u might never have"}
{"text":"Pizza is terrific!! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Service is just OK as it is a busy bar"}
{"text":"Located inside a little dive bar, this place is a hidden gem. Who doesn't enjoy yummy food and cheap drinks?   Favorites: Guinea's pie, back home pie, loaded potato fries and suicide fries  Warning: the suicide sauce is spicy,but AMAZING. When I order the suicide fries, I ask for the sauce on the side so you can decide how much sauce to use and the sauce is good with the pizza!  Every person visiting Vegas That i have brought  here always wants to go back! Just writing about this place is making me hungry..."}
{"text":"Now from the outside, this place might scare people off. Equal parts biker bar and tattoo parlor with metal music in the background, don't be afraid to explore because the pies were excellent.   We tried the Guinea's Pie and the Fatboy. The Guinea's pie came as a gooey, thick crust pizza. The crust itself on both pies were not doughy, but fluffy with just the right amount of crispness for that real oven baked taste and texture. Loaded with gooey mozzarella goodness and a white garlic sauce that isn't so strong that it overpowers the cheese, spinach and meatballs.   The Fatboy was flavorful with its meaty toppings of salami, pepperoni, ham, italian sausage. Closer to what a traditional meatlovers pizza would be without overloading it so as not to overpower the taste of the tomatoes or the crust. Another very good pie.   The wee sized portions are enough for two people share (6 slices in a rectangular shape)."}
{"text":"Pizza here was amazing... I forget the name of the one I chose but it was artichoke, tomato, onion, peppers, garlic, some other stuff... wow"}
{"text":"Food is always awesome and good service. Almost always get a full sheet with half Rebel and half Naked city. Garlic knots are legit and very good wings. Go here often as my waist line will allow it."}
{"text":"THE BEST PIZZA IN THE WORLD. I've never had better pizza than this. The Guinea Pie is incredible. White garlic sauce, mozzarella, ricotta cheese, meatballs and.. spinach I think? Such an amazing combination, and what you pay for it is beyond fair, cheap when you've been eating nothing but stuff on the strip for the last few days. We also ordered the loaded fries on the side of an order of chicken wings. Everything was perfect. The portions are huge, and the prices are unbeatable. Service was great too. We went next door to Moon Doggies while we waited and had a few drinks. Best time I had in Vegas probably. That pizza really just made my trip. I wonder if they can freeze it and ship it to California.. please???"}
{"text":"I was on the road looking for Lola's and I had the wrong address.  Luckily I had my laptop with me and I had to go to a McDonalds to use their \"free\" WiFi.  Well.... I felt compelled to buy something so I got a quarter pounder meal deal for about $7 just to use their WiFi.  I found I was closer to Naked City Pizza, so I decdied to try this place.  I walk into this dive bar where it so dark, it took time for the eyes to adjust.  I asked where the restaurant is and they said I'm standing in it.  I sat at one of about 6 tables and proceeded to be shocked by what was being served in that environment.  We're talking white china style plates with silverware.  No paper plates and plastic forks.  I had the caeser salad which was very good.  The dressing tasted homemade, but can't be sure.  I had the garlic cheese buns and the small Royal sandwhich.  The buns are incredible. They are just pizza dough rolled with garlic and cheese.  Baked and served with a marinara dipping sauce.  They serve 5 per order.  This was great becasue they are fresh out of the oven. I only ate one and took the rest to my hotel.  My Royal sandwich was on a nice toasted Italian roll with their homemade sausage.  The fennel flavor of the sausage was WOW.  All that food for about $20.  Don't be afraid to walk in this dive looking bar. The food is well worth it."}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was really good however my husband thought it was bland. We also got an order of the suicide fries, the pepper sauce was very tasty. And the wings where just wings, the same as everyones. So the food was ok. But it is literally in the back of an all out dive bar. But if you are in the market for a used car there are plenty in the parking lot. .... yes they sell used cars out front. Well we went because it was on triple D.... and we found out after going just which \"D\" it was."}
{"text":"Everything is great about this place.. the pizza and the drinks that Arty (bartender at moon doggies) makes for you as you wait for your pizza.. This place is open late too.. great pizza great drinks.."}
{"text":"Love this place great pizza and piping hot! Employees were very friendly and helpful. Great bar great music ! My go to place for pizza."}
{"text":"This update is long overdue as now this pizza place is my favorite in the whole city. When I first ate here i wasn't impressed....I liked that it was so close to my house and the bar is pretty cool. But after coming back again and ordering a classic sausage and mushroom pizza.....this is the best sausage pizza I've ever had in las vegas.....that's all I order and that's all I'm ever going to order. I've brought friends here and now they're hooked....my friends are chefs."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. We had the bacon and egg one. So rich. So good. The buffalo chicken dip is delicious too. This place is a dive but good atmosphere. Robert was a great server. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Searched for gravy fries or \"poutin\" in Las Vegas and came up with this place. French fries, gravy and cheese...simple enough yet not offered in most places on the west coast. I walked into this place and wanted to walk back out. Moon Doggies is a smoked filled local dive bar that houses a pizza shop inside. I was determined to get my poutine fries and ventured inside. Finally put my order in after standing at window for only 15 minutes, I figured how bad could it be? Fries were greasy, gravy was something I could have heated up from a jar, cheese curds looked like tapioca balls that I thought were supposed to melt into a gooey cheese blanket but alas no. Overall, a disappointing but should have known better from the looks inside experience. Will not be returning to this dirty dive. If you do go, get a HEP shot beforehand."}
{"text":"Very good pizza; and probably in my top 5 of best pizzas I've ever had around the world! The crust is amassing and the unique sauce with the meatball is something you can only find at Naked City Pizza! I highly suggest stopping in and getting a Guinea Pie Pizza!"}
{"text":"Hmm, not bad. I decided to get some take out pizza, based on the DDD review.   I got 1 of each pizza - all cheese and Naked City. Also go the stuffed mushrooms and zeppoli.  For the pizza, the crust got a little soggy but the flavor, toppings, and cheese were great overall. The stuffing for the mushrooms was mostly sausage, I think. It was unpleasantly firm and lacked some flavor, though the sauce made up for that. The zeppoli also lacked some flavor - just tough dough with powdered sugar. Thankfully, there was some chocolate sauce for taste.  The pizza shop is in a dive bar. I suspect the pizza is great fresh and would go awesome with a beer in this place."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing!    Took a star off because it's in a bar, so limits it to a babysitter night.  If it were closer I would do take out.  So sad because it was seriously yummy pizza."}
{"text":"Oh yes, when you gotta have a slice or two, and you just want it to be ready fast and taste good, get yer butt over here. This is great 'za, and he'll make you what ever you want, by the slice. At $3/ea, I was full after 1, two slices and I wished I hadn't but it was just so goooood. I got 2 Royales. Next time going for the Guinea and the White. Get some fresh basil on top and you'll be smiling."}
{"text":"I la-la-love their suicide fries!!! I just found out you can get suicide wings too so I am definitely going back to get those. definitely try the Guinea Pie too. Best pizza I've had in Vegas so far."}
{"text":"We tried the Poutine fries and the Naked City Pizza, and hubby had a Brown Ale, all very good. We ordered the small fries and pizza, more than enough for 2 and had some.to take home. Dinner for $22 in Las Vegas, great food. Nothing fancy, just great.food. Limited parking."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. (from \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" to \"Restaurant Impossible!\") I understand slow/busy bar service - but this was straight up rudeness and we were ignored for over 20 minutes. we walked in (just two of us) in front of a group of four or so people. The group that came in behind us sat behind us as well, and they had their food before we even were acknowledged and got a glass of water. We tried asking the male waiter for water and he continued past us (ignored us!) and helped the table behind us, taking their order, bringing them several plates of food. The waitress then told us that the other waiter would help us. we were continued to be ignored. i felt bad that it was the waitress' first day, but the other waiter was of no assistance to her (or us), which made the entire establishment look bad. He kept walking past our table to serve and check on the group that came behind us. it took 20 minutes for a glass of water and an additional 5 to get my coke. we waited over a half hour for the garlic rolls (an appetizer) and about 50 minutes for a \"wee\" sized pizza.  Meanwhile the group that came in behind us has had a \"not so wee\" sized pizza (medium), a couple orders or wings, etc. and the waiter kept bringing out plates for them while we sat with one glass of water. The group of people behind us finished and paid for their meal as our fricking appetizer was coming out. the ONLY reason we didn't just walk away is human courtesy to the poor waitress on her first day. Looks like this place needs to be on food network again for the show \"Restaurant Impossible!\" because the male waiter was a complete ass - either that or he was racist and ignored my boyfriend. I literally saw him make eye contact as we asked for help and he kept it moving to the group just past us...that came in after us!  I will never come back, and i will never tell my out of town guests to come here."}
{"text":"Maybe Naked City Pizza is having a bad night in both locations. Drove from Paradise location to here (see other review) on the promise that the order would be placed for us while we drove. How could they have, phone here has been off the hook for hours. We were ignored when we came in, and when we asked about ordering, a woman wearing a Naked City shirt pointed to the window in the back. Asked about the advance order, and literally got a look like I had asked for pizza on a golden platter. Mentioned the phone being off the hook. Again must actually have two heads, the look again while she held up the cordless phone and showed us it was fine. (Called back while we were eating at home, and the line was still busy.) So unbelievably rude...worst I have experienced in a long time. Don't care if the pizza is good. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"One of my best friends raved about this place. Called it the best pizza in Vegas. I will admit I was judging it against this expectation he presented to me.   1am came across and we were all intoxicated. As the shouts that pizza arrived approximately 35 zombies dressed in various Halloween costumes. I cannot lie. It looked and tasted like a square papa johns cheese pizza. Nothing special. I am open to trying it again and will update this review if I do."}
{"text":"Can only rate the pizza which I have gotten to go twice. First time I picked it up and it was very good. The guinea's pie has meatballs, ricotta, spinach, mozzarella and a white sauce but I subbed in a red sauce. Had a unique, almost lemony, taste that my husband and I enjoyed. A half sheet was enough for two meals. The next time we ordered the same thing delivered but it was not as good. My main issue was that there was little to no cheese on the outer slices and none on one of the corner pieces. Cheese is important on my pizza, next time I'll order extra. Still a decent dinner for not too much $ and I will be back."}
{"text":"Can somebody please tell me what all the hype going around this place is about? This tiny sandwich shop on Las Vegas Blvd. was recently opened by two chefs, one of whom is the chef at Diego restaurant in the MGM. My husband and I read a very positive review in the Weekly awhile back and decided to try it out. They were applauded for their house-cured and smoked meats, and the fact that everything ranging from pasta salad to pickles is made in house, except the bread. My husband is a big sandwich lover so was excited that there might be a unique new sandwich shop in town, and close to our house at that. The first time we ordered the Naked Chopped salad ($7.99) and the Naked Veggie sandwich ($8.99), which were both disappointing. The salad wasn't chopped at all but came with massive slices of so-so meat and a few boring vegetables. The Naked Veggie was served on semi-fresh pumpernickle bread that was so thick you hardly tasted anything but. The filling wasn't good either, with unseasoned veggies and a terrible eggplant \"stuffing\" (as if the sandwich needed more bread). We were disheartened to say the least but today decided to give it another try. They were still new when we first tried it so perhaps they needed some time to adjust. This time my husband got the Royal sandwich on a kaiser roll, that was still way too thick. The hot cappicola inside was good but basically it was an average sandwich that was too heavy on the bread. It came with a side of pasta salad that could have been great if it wasn't under-done and under-seasoned, a side of homemade giardinera (not bad), and a habanero pickle (spicy and tasty). I was  feeling under the weather so I ordered the tortilla soup ($3.99) which was hands down the worst tortilla soup I've ever had. It was completely one dimensional and tasted like tomato paste mixed with hot water. It is prepared with tons of avocado chunks (who likes that much hot avocado?) and the toppings consisted of cheddar cheese cubes, sour cream with chilies, and stale tortilla chips. You would think that a chef of a Mexican restaurant could make a decent tortilla soup but this was inedible. I had two bites and threw the rest away. I called to let the girl at the counter know how disappointed I was but all she could say was, \"Did you add all the toppings?\" \"Yes, but it probably would have been better if I hadn't\" I thought. Nothing could make that soup better. What we don't understand is why this sandwich place that is mediocre at best is getting all these rave reviews on Yelp! and other sites. If anyone has had a good experience there I'd love to hear it, along with a detailed explanation as to why. It seems to me that they need to stop spending so much time curing all their meats and start spending time making the food taste good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My daughter had a desination wedding in Las Vegas this weekend and we wanted to be able to find a relaxing, fun,inexpensive place where everyone can be together, eat and drink. Naked City Pizza accommodated us (@30 people)on a short notice and we had an awesome experience. Pizza and chicken wings were delicious and pizza's are huge! We didnt expect it to be fancy or anything but it was perfect for us. We moved tables around, made a little dance floor, everyone in our party was pleased and enjoyed the setting. Very nice people! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Get a lot for the price with all the expensive food in Las Vegas it's worth it."}
{"text":"PROS:  - Good pizza - Relaxed atmosphere - Off the busy strip  CONS: - slow service when more than 3 tables are filled - it's SO dark inside - miscalculated check DOUBLE CHECK YOUR CHARGES!!  Pizza was yummy. I tired a Build Your Own, and the Guinea's. The Guinea's lacked the garlic flavor I was expecting, but the Build Your Own pizza we ordered was delicious thanks to the sauce and dough. The dough is crisp, yet doughy inside. Here are my ratings (1 - 10, 10 being highest) for items i tried:  Build Your Own: 8 Guinea's Pizza: 5 Suicide Fries: 7 Garlic Fires: 3 (needs garlic!) Chicken Wing Dip: 7  I was very UNIMPRESSED about the check. Our group ordered a number of items from the menu and many of them were charged incorrectly on the bill. There were items that were $0.25 - $7.50 overchared.  Also, tax was incorrectly calculated as well. The waitress told me that each item price on the check included tax, but this was obviously incorrect since some items on the checked actually matched the menu price, while others were higher than the menu price.   I hope the manager(s) decides to convert to a computerized system."}
{"text":"We ordered dinner from here via Uber eats the food was fantastic! We run a doggy daycare so it's not always easy to get out for dinner! We had wings which were super yummy and saucey! But the fries were completely out of this world, I love spicy food and so I ordered the suicide fries they had heat but they also had awesome flavor and the portions are very generous!Cant wait to actually go here to eat because the Uber menu is limited! I highly recommend trying this place if you want simple food with a bang! Thanks so much Rhonda McCullough (North Paws Ranch)"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try after seeing them on DDD. We went in on a Monday night so the place was pretty quiet and were greeted right away. My wife and I are big fans of spicy food so we had to try the suicide fries. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate the fries a solid 8. They are killer... we couldn't stop eating them! (the next morning was a different story, however :) We also tried their Naked City Pizza which was done right. The crust was perfect along with the cheese and toppings. We ordered the \"not so wee\" which is a medium and it was more than plenty for two people. Finally, the price was more than reasonable for the quality of the food. Give them a try next time you're in Vegas, I assure you their food beats any of the expensive junk they serve at casino buffets."}
{"text":"I am giving 3 stars because the pizza was delicious but the atmosphere here was terrible and uncomfortable! Moment we walked in no one greeted us and it was just dark and dreary! This place needs to be in its own separate building out of the bar!   The pizza we ordered was the guine pie and a pepperoni and we loved the pies!"}
{"text":"The pizza was as advertised.   We had a \"not so wee\" Fat Boy pizza and a Royal hoagie.  We could've lived without the sandwich. It was some grilled italian sausage and cheese thrown on the bun.   The pizza had a perfect combo of crust to cheese to sauce ratio. The garlic flavored crust was done expertly as well.  It wasn't so overpowering that it ruined the taste of the pie.   It complimented and enhanced the flavor nicely.   The joint is small, a lil' smoky, and dimly lit.  People that cry about how smoky it is must have lived a pampered life.  Either that, or they are from California and don't remember what bars were like before the anti-smoking campaigns.  In other words it was a bar, not a smoky bar."}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing but the kitchen looks a little grungy. I also saw a lady carrying ice from the restaurant to the other side. Leaving one entry way to go into a separate side of the building. Seemed unsanitary."}
{"text":"I've read great reviews on this place& friend said pizza was very good, so away we go. Im up for new places & hole in the wall joints as well, as long as food is worthy of the go.. Was warned, it is a dive/biker bar feel...no big deal, im not a snob, as long as I feel safe. Its late lunch hour when we walk in. Music was so IncrediblY loud we couldn't hear eachother sitting at the table..I mean it was SupeR Loud,hit you in the face loud.. 3 people sitting randomly at bar, tvs strewn about. Very lo energy,out of order pinball game, vending machine with miscellaneous odd items..cigarettes & other things that didn't look like they belonged there.. seats were old & dingy..the booths seats were torn up, ripped to .... ,to be exact. Remarkable it did not smell of cigarettes though it looked like it would... We looked at menu , sat for over 5 minutes& No one even acknowledged our existence , not even a wave, nada. Between that & the obnoxiously loud music (maybe ok for nighttime , but off putting during the day) we got up & left. Maybe I'll order delivery at some point, but probably won't be rushing back to this place, like ever."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Vegas for a conference a co-worker mentioned leaving the strip and heading out to a pizza place he saw on DD&D.  I have only gone to one recommendation from DD&D because it was local to me and was several disappointed that nothing I wanted was on the menu.  The co-worker did not remember what Guy had ordered so we had to ask the embarrassing question to our server just to ensure the super fan with us got the full DD&D experience.  We ordered medium wings, suicide fries, and a pizza.  The suicide fries were hot, I mean sweating profusely hot but not too hot to eat.  What do you expect from a dish named suicide?  We ate every single fry and after our mouths had cooled we craved that spice again.  The pizza was doughy for my taste but still enjoyable as a great followup to our spicy fries.  The wings were good as well but I not a big buffalo sauce fan so the rest of the group ate those while I scooped up any last remnants of those fries... The only wish I have for the place was more options for beer.  I asked the server if there was any special beers and she named Shock Top as an option.... I ended up ordering a forgettable local brown ale.  I do know that not ever bar/restaurant is going to cater to my beer needs so I can't fault them entirely but... I can hope that maybe the next time I am there something better will sneak onto the menu.   Overall I was very happy we stopped here and if I find myself in Vegas again anytime soon I will head over to enjoy those fantastic fries."}
{"text":"I had the white pizza, it had tons of cheese plus ricotta,  the crust was delicious! !  My new favorite pizza joint."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I ordered buffalo wings (hot) and the naked city pizza.  Buffalo wings were great. Boyfriend gave them an 8 out of 10.  When our pizza arrived we had a slice each and halfway through eating our first slice we realized the toppings on the pizza weren't what we ordered. I went up to the counter and asked if we had received the wrong pizza or ordered something different. The cashier apologized for the mistake and offered to make us a new pizza with the right toppings. She also didn't want to take back the incorrect pizza. The wrong pizza was the fat boy pizza. It was okay but we're not big fans of ham on pizza.  When our naked city pizza came, the cashier also refunded us for our buffalo wings! Totally unnecessary but she insisted. The naked city pizza was delicious.  This place is great and the staff is super nice. They definitely went above and beyond to make our experience a good one."}
{"text":"I take no joy in giving a bad review. But, since I depend on good AND bad reviews when researching a new place, I think it's important.  That said...whoooo boy, was this place bad!  Really, really bad.  We planned a family trip to Vegas.  Knowing we'd come into town hungry, we decided to eat a quick meal away from the casinos.  We found a great deal on Restaurants.com and after reading the reviews, we thought this would fit the bill perfectly.  Some of the best places are found in dives or 'hole in the wall' spots, but our first impression was dismal. It was 3pm on a Saturday, there should have been some form of life. Instead, the room was dark and empty with a TV blaring Family Feud. The lone employee stood behind a small counter that didn't even have a hint that food might be found there.  Just a small, empty counter with a loney bathroom-type sink.  Most disconcerting was a total lack of scent!  Even if the kitchen was in back, we should smell that wonderful fragrance of pizza.  Nope. None.  Not even the merest suggestion that anyone had ate in that room that day.  We decided to press on, encouraged by all the signs saying how they had been featured on The Food Network  We ordered the Guinea Pie in the full sheet (knowing the teen boys and leftover pizza go together like teen boys and leftover pizza!)  At nearly $40, it was pricey, but FOOD NETWORK approved.  To take the edge off the long drive, we ordered the poutine fries as well.  Thirst, was another matter. A small retail-type cooler offering a modest selection of small individual sodas and water was the only option.  We ordered and began to wait. And wait....  And wait.  After 25 minutes, we began to realize that we had made a huge mistake.  The lady behind the counter would leave for stretches to get supplies from the bar, but never interacted with us.   After 30 minutes, we wondered why we had not at least received the poutine.  I mean, unless you are growing potatoes, it should not take that long to make fries.  After nearly 40 minutes, a couple of boxes were handing to us, and she again disappeared.  The poutine was cold. Dead cold. No gravy, some sad-looking white clods and limp fries that were as frigid as Melania Trump. We immediately sent them back to the kitchen to be reheated.  The pizza was even more disappointing. The thin, uneven edges looked like a too-small amount of dough had been stretched to make it fit a large pan.  They were over-cooked and saturated in a deep coating of oil.  The toppings were not even remotely to the edges; actually starting at the 2nd piece in.  The sliced meaballs were overcooked to the consistency of dog chew treats.  Then I lifted up the oily mass to expose an actual undercooked crust. Seriously, how much skill is needed to both undercook AND overcook a single pizza? After a single bite, my sons and I threw down the pizza in disgust. My husband, however, doesn't like the make rush judgements and braved a second bite.  The vote was unanimous: this was hands-down the worst pizza we had even eaten.  How bad does things have to be to request a refund from a Restaurants.com coupon?  We hated to do this, but we were about to leave a restaurant after a single bite (or two!)  The lady apologized, refunded our money and then gave us the nearly reheated box of poutine for the road.  In the car, we each braved a bite to see if our decision had been too rash.  Uh...no.  We pulled over and threw it in the nearest trash.  We have found some amazing gems in different cities using Restaurants.com and Yelp.  It's a great set of tools to use when you want to avoid chains and discover something new. In this instance, we took a gamble and lost.  I'd have to advise you to pass this one up."}
{"text":"I was lost, there were 2 different signs on the door. One stating they were closed for a private party another saying visit the Paradise location. So I called the number, the nice man stated go inside the bar next door Moon-doggies to order. Walked in to a total local dive bar full of smoke with my kids, to only discover you order at a little window and eat there. Guess this is the \"Dive\" part of the feature show Diners, Drive-ins & Dives. Headed over to the Paradise location."}
{"text":"I ordered the naked city pizza and wasn't disappointed. We got the wee size which is the smallest size they have but it is not small at all. The pizza is very flavorful and I loved the crust. Loaded with toppings. Business was kind of hard to find because it's inside a bar. It's dark inside. They didn't have drinks. You have to order from bar. Chicken wings were delicious and have a good spice. Fries had the perfect seasoning. Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Groupons FTW! I'll make this clear right now. I have not tried their pizza. I was there specifically for the Poutine.  After zip lining down Fremont Street, we decided to hit up Naked City to use up my $20 Groupon. That got us a large Poutine ($5), 20 Hot Chicken Wings ($13), and a slice of cheese pizza ($2). The pizza slice was for my friend. I had no interest in trying it.  So how was the Poutine? I can't compare to the Poutine I've had in Toronto because it's been a couple of years. For sure, it was Freakin' Huge. That's actually the size designation - Freakin' Huge (not \"large\" as I stated earlier). I'm not really sure if they use cheese curds, but it was yummy and gooey, albeit slightly salty after a while. It's definitely something you could share with a few people.  The Chicken Wings were also good. It's not hard to make good wings, but I suppose it's not hard to mess them up either. My cousin said she really enjoyed them, but she admitted that she's been craving wings recently. I give them the thumbs up. They were pretty large too.  Moon Doggies is not really a place I'm in a hurry to revisit, but if I'm ever craving Poutine again, I know where to go."}
{"text":"I ordered the rebel pie and the guinea pie both were delicious! But the guinea was better than I expected and I wish I had gotten a the full sheet! Definitely worth the price"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to check this place out for awhile.  Last night a few of us from work stopped in after a long work week.  The place is in a bar which is pretty cool.  As for the bar I really liked it. Has a kinda divey feeling to it, but probably cuz its an older building.  Not like your run of the mill P.T.s or Timbers, definatley not snooty.  I got the suicide fries and split a pie.  Fries were great and so was the pie.  The prices are also really good, 3 bucks for the fries and 13 for the pie.  Small draft beer selection but I will over look that.  The waitress was cool too she comped both of us a beer and I wasn't even gambling.  I wish this place was closer otherwise I would go more often.  Naked City Pizza.......keep doing what ya doing!"}
{"text":"obsessed with the Poutine Fries here! Best ones I've had in Vegas! Their other item that I fully enjoy is the chicken dip you'll definitely feel like going to the gym the next day, but it'll be worth it! Great food despite it being in a small neighborhood bar"}
{"text":"We had it delivered via Postmates and it was awesome! We ordered the Back Home pizza and a chicken finger salad.  The only thing I can complain about is how there wasn't hardly enough pepperoni to cover each slice AND the sausage (that we paid an extra $4.00 for) Also; the salad said it was supposed to be buffalo tenders (tenders dipped in buffalo sauce) and that didn't happen, nor was there a side of the sauce. Although, delivery never gives anything justice so we are going back and eat it there on our next visit. It was good enough for another shot"}
{"text":"Oh man.  No words.   This place is a complete dive from the outside, but don't pass it by!!!    Have a beer with the friendly locals (who might eyeball you a bit upon arrival, but don't worry and ORDER THE FREAKIN' PIZZA!!!  I'm not a pizza eater, by choice, just not enough nutrition vs calories for my fitness.  But I love food, all food.   This was the greatest pizza I've ever had, hands down (I was a pizza eater for 45years, so it's not like I never...)  super tasty, cheesy, great ingredients, loaded up and awesome crust.  Just do it."}
{"text":"I LOVE the Guinea pizza!! For me pizza is a treat; so I need it to be really good and satisfying and this covers both! This place is definitely not fancy but the food is great so it is worth a try. The stuffed peppers are also very good.."}
{"text":"I'd have to say the pizza was average for bar pizza. I did like the homemade dough, but the pizza seemed to be missing something to make it stand out. I'd get it again if I ever end up in the Moon Doggies bar, but I would not make a special trip there for it."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting for the weekend and we have a friend who is a local so we decided to give NCP a try. It is hard not to be skeptical when you walk in because it is very much a dive bar. But wait, did I just eat one of the best salads of my life here? A regular side salad? Why yes I did. Shocking? Why yes it was. We also ordered the garlic fries (thick-cut, had good garlic flavor and parm cheese on top), as well as the the Guinea Pie and Naked Pizza.  I shockingly wasn't a big fan of the homemade meatballs on the Guinea Pie, they were a bit greasy and fatty tasting for me. But the Naked pie was incredible. Our server was a riot, too. Overall I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Love this hidden gem! Every time I order at work...everyone asks where did I order the pizza from...looks and tastes great. Very partial to the guinea!  I don't like the margherita...was horrible.   The Paesa is very good for the vegetarians too!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Been hearing about this place for a while so happy I finally tried it out. Started off with the pizza egg rolls BOMB! And delicious. We had the rebel pizza and a cheese/pineapple and both were so perfect! The pizza is not as greasy and oily as most places and it's cut in square pieces like I like with that mice oven brick taste and crispy crust I will definitely be back for more! Great service too."}
{"text":"It's really closer to 4 stars  but not quite, the food is great, haven't had anything I didn't like but the service really brings the rating down.  It's not the the staff isn't friendly or helpful it's just that every time I've been here there is only one waitress so you are constantly waiting for service.    Enough about the service, let's talk about the food...the suicide fries are incredible.  I love spicy and consider that I can handle the heat but these are HOT, I think my lips were a bit swollen even. Needless to say though these are pretty much the sole reason I come to Naked City Pizza.  The pies are great too, I've tried about 5 different ones, the chicken finger and fatboy are my faves. The portions are huge, the wee is 6 huge slices.    All in all a great place to try.  Just don't forget it's in a bar so no kids."}
{"text":"Very friendly both at the window and the bar. Best pizza in Vegas, best white pizza I've ever had. One slice will fill you up, and it is just as good warmed up the next day. :)"}
{"text":"I saw this place on The Food Networks Diners Drive Ins & Dives. So I said I have to try it. The suicide fries are awesome. Hot & flavorful.Just right. The pizza was some of the best I ever had. I had the Guinea Pie. Our waitress was Teresa. She was very friendly & helpful. We enjoyed this place so much we even bought their T-shirts. I will definitely return for a great meal at good price & friendly service."}
{"text":"Best slice of pie I've had in vegas, wife had the meatball sub ,homemade meatballs, we had the suicide & loaded baked potato fries everything was very good including service portions are big, prices are fair - it is a definite must do again for us"}
{"text":"One of the Las Vegas treasures. Best Pizza in town. Great and helpful staff. I try to order different pizza on every trip, and now I have 9 favorites !!!"}
{"text":"06/12/11 DINNER.  Having never been here before, last night I attended their PIG OUT, a 5-course presentation of food, buffet-style, created by the owner/chef and 3 fellow chefs from the LV area. The food was FANTASTIC, not even factoring in the VALUE the event turned out to be. I must come back just to try more pizza, but they should put that pappardelle and porchetta on the menu!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, I would frequently order from here weekly!!!!! On Friday evening I ordered a sheet pizza and sub which was delivered and not right.  I called to complain and they said there was nothing they could do since bitesquad delivered it. My mom then called again complaining they said they would remake. So we went to pick up pizza and an employee of naked city pizza gave us an attitude and then gave us the finger!!!! This attitude and behavior is completely unacceptable for the customer service industry! I don't think I could ever return even tho I was born and raised in buffalo and this is my only little piece of home I have out here. Completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Typical bar location. Pizza was awesome. Crust was just the way I like.  Choose the naked city 1/4 sheet good for two. Beer from the bar and you are set."}
{"text":"If you're looking for giant, greasy pizzas, Naked City Pizza Shop is the place for you.   Located inside a run down bar, this place looks a little sketchy. The parking lot is not very well maintained, and the bar itself is dimly-lit and old. But don't let that deter you from the fact that the pizzas here are amazing.   Our table got the Frickin' Huge Naked City Pizza, and the pizza definitely lives up to the name. The pizza came in a 13\" x 9\" sheet pan. This pizza definitely feeds about 7-8 people and costs only $30, so that's a deal right there! The toppings on this pizza are pretty standard: pepperoni, sausage, sweet peppers, onions, olives, mozzarella cheese, and red sauce. Both the pepperoni and sausage add a spiciness and saltiness to the pie. The olives and cheese also added to the saltiness and greasiness, while both the sweet peppers and onions were overshadowed by the other ingredients. I think the best part of the pie was the crust. The crust was thin, crispy, and flaky. It balanced out the fat from the toppings.   The service was definitely way below average. Since it's a bar, you have to order the pizza from the back / from the bartender. There is no table service at this place. After you order, you're pretty much left on your own. Wait time for the pizza was actually pretty reasonable for the size of the pie. But other than that, you'd have to get our own water, plates, utensils, and napkins. All are located in one area, so that's convenient. But the tap water tasted a little weird, so I'd steer away from that and just bring your own.   Overall, the pizzas here are really good. When it comes to craving super greasy foods, this is the place you should go. Even though the location is a little sketchy and the service is below par, I would still recommend this place."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! Nothing but good things to say. Only complaint is that it isn't closer to my house."}
{"text":"After trying the pizza wings and Cesar salad 3 stars is all we can do..... The salad was basic nothing special about it,the the dressing tasted weird.... The wings were good but nothing to brag about.... The pizza lacked flavor the crust was tasteless and soggy. I've had better pizza! Besides the food the customer service was poor. No interaction with cashier didn't even get a hello on the way in she sat behind her register we had to get our own utensils plates and drinks. The restaurant needs major unleashes or at least some cleaning the floors were very dirty. At the end the food was ok nothing special could have had better pizza somewhere else."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it's the perfect place if you like dive bars! Great food and great atmosphere. Definitely order the suicide fries if you're a fan of lip burning, panting for air spicy food. There are loaded fries with minimum spice and big flavor, if preferred. Football season specials available as well. Possibly for other sports.   BUT did wait 45 mins for my order the last time I was there and when I asked about it turned out our ticket was lost. It's such a busy place so grab one of the staff if you need to, after all it is a NY spot. Great pies though!"}
{"text":"Talk about great food!!!! I moved to Vegas about a month ago and this place is still my favorite eatery thus far! The pizza was phenomenal! We got the fat boy and the guinea pie, both of which were stellar! Also, tasty sandwiches!!! I'm so glad this place is walking distance of my house! Definitely my top pick!!!!! Get naked city pizza!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday afternoon. Business was fairly light.  Like most people that travel to Vegas, I heard about NCPS via DDD on the Food Network. This might be silly to say, but the thing that drew me in was the sound of a pizza cutter slicing through the sound enhanced crispy crust of one of their pies on TV.  The atmosphere is obviously a dive bar. Since we came while the sun was up, it wasn't noisy and not crowded in any respect. I'm sure if we came a little later in the day, it would have been standing room only, as there really isn't a LOT of room to sit.  We ordered a wee guinea pie and a wee loaded fries. The fries were a bit on the salty/over-seasoned side, but the sour cream, bacon and cheese helped cut through the saltiness. The pizza... oh the pizza...  The pizza was FANTASTIC. I'm usually not one for \"white\" pizzas, but this was really well done. The sauce wasn't overpowering but still had a great flavor that complimented the meatballs and spinach. The crust tasted just as good as it looked, it was thick without being too heavy or greasy. Overall, it was a very well made pie.  In a nutshell: The atmosphere isn't for everyone, but the food and service were top notch, enough for me to make another trip here next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite pizza in Las Vegas. Located inside Moon Doggies, which has Labatt Blue on tap. If you are from Buffalo, NY, this is a great taste of home. They sell full rectangular sheet pizzas with square slices like back home. The wings are pretty good too. Saw a sign last time I was there for wings with Chiavetta's sauce. Can't wait to try them next time."}
{"text":"I'm from Buffalo so I was soooo excited to see this pizza establishment! Whenever I am homesick for Buffalo I come here to dine and feel at home. I love it because they have loganberry which is a drink you can usually only find in Buffalo. Even if you're not from Buffalo you have to try it! I have yet to come here for a sports game but I really want to go soon to watch a Sabres game and again in the fall to watch a Buffalo Bills game. My uncle and I ordered out from their last night and got Guniea's Pie. This pie was featured on diners, drive in and dives so I really wanted to try it. I'm not usually a huge fan of white sauce but this pizza was AWESOME. This pie has meatballs, spinach, ricotta, sausage and white garlic sauce. The flavor was incredible. Another good pie is Back-Home pie which features thick tomato sauce, mixed with mozzarella, oregano and Parmesan, pepperoni, sausage with a garlic crust. If you are more a red sauce fan this pie is for you! This place is very casual and a great place to go if you are looking for something low key. The only downside is that it is in a bar so if you have a family you will have to order this pizza to go because you must be 21 or older to eat here."}
{"text":"I saw this on TV and went to visit my boyfriend inn Vegas. Hands down by far the best pizza I have ever had...and I've had a LOT of pizza. He moved home to Cleveland shortly after I went to visit and we have been taking about seeing if they will overnight us a pie...addiction!   The crust is perfect and the toppings are amazing.very food combos and creativity. I hasn't been back to Vegas twice since then and cannot miss this gem!   You guys are doing amazing! Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Seen this place on the food network, so we were finally excited to go try it! We ordered the Naked City pizza, Suicide Fries, and A Bag of Zeppolis. We waited about 30 mins and they brought out the dessert first? Which we thought was odd.. then about 5 mins later the fries.. waited about 25 minutes longer and went up to the window to ask for the pizza to go cause it was taking to long.. another 5 mins goes by I ask for a box for the fries and she FINALLY hands me the pizza. It was not cooked and super doughy.. my husband went to speak to them and the guy asks so you want another pizza?? Umm no we waited an hour for this one and was uncooked?!?! They gave us the money back for the pizza after another 5 mins. We are super disappointed  and won't be returning! Maybe we will try the other location."}
{"text":"Man...   Love my dive bars. Always my go-to hang out spots. So for a late night beer and carby greasy food, come here!  Here, you go to the bar grab your drinks, and at the opposite of the end of the bar is a small window where you order your \"I will regret this later\" food.   I went with a friend here since I hear a lot of rave about the place. I noticed by the entrance door they have plates, napkins, and utensils. You sit yourself, you grab whatever you need and enjoy. They do bring out your food to your table though.   I tried the poutine. Not too bad. Not sure if Canadians will like it, but yanno. Might have to come back and try other special fries they had in the menu.   Zeppoles in a greasy brown paper bag. Eat them fresh! These sugary, thick bread dumped in chocolate is really tasty! Generous amount in the bag!   The pizza, I wasn't a fan of. I had to rip it up to eat it. It was way hard and I couldn't finish it. Noticed the roof of my mouth torn and cut up too after eating the pizza. Cut to where I tasted my own blood....and the pizza was the last thing I ate.    Anyway, this is a divey bar. Don't expect clean elegance. Expect a rough looking bar with fattening huge portioned (sharing is optional) bar food and good beer. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"After a couple nights of eating on the strip... and being overcharged and disappointed (staying at the Aria) I wanted some plain good ole fashioned pizza. I recalled an episode of Triple D mentioning Naked City Pizza. So I googled the Arville location.  Drove from the hotel to the place. I saw the sign which said Moondoogies bar with Naked City Pizza underneath, a lil confusing because the entrance is just a divey bar, luckily I got a whiff of some nice pizza pie.   The place itself had a dark ambiance of a real dive bar, I did feel like I was an intruder from the looks I got from the indigenous bar flies. I made beeline past the bar towards one of the waitresses who quickly glanced me up and down, to size me up \"Tourist\".  She had a nice ink sleeve going on but had a rather nice sunny disposition.   So I ordered a couple of pies. A wee plain cheese for the kids and a not so wee Naked City Pizza Pie for us. It took awhile like almost a half hour, so it would be helpful to order ahead of time, which I did not do.  The pizzas were spot on. Glad I braved the iffy location, Better then the crap from CPK (which I know isn't saying much)  I'll try the new location closer to the strip, they opened a location near the Hard Rock. Definitely making it a point to get one of their pies next time down!"}
{"text":"People seem to love dive bars and I'm not really a big fan.  Maybe it's because I'm getting old and crotchety.  I did like this place though and not everyone in the bar seemed like they wanted to punch me in the face when I walked in, so that was nice.  I knew what to expect before walking into Moon Doggies and had been looking forward to trying this pizza for a long time.  It was my heavyset brothers that finally got me to go and I'm very glad I did.  I expected the service to be downright garbage and was very suprised to have an attentive and polite waiter.  We order two Not So Wee pizzas along with some Pizza Logs and Poutine.  The pizza logs were incredible but the poutine was a little cold in the middle.  It still tasted good but cold cheese is not something on my 'favorites' list.  The pizza were great as well and this has to be one of my favorite types of crust ever.  Fairly thick but also pretty light tasting.  We were all big fans of this place and were very glad we came.  I think Naked City Pizza has a good thing going but it would be nice if they could get their own stand-alone place.  That's just me.  I would love to stop in here for a pizza again in the near future.  We brought a pieces home to my wife and she loved it as well.  Very good stuff!"}
{"text":"finally made it here.......... DDD watcher. Beer on tap was good, Chicken wings \"hot\" were really good. just about perfect! Great taste, good heat and 10 of them to a small order. I'm kinda a \" NY THIN CRUST\" guy but I tried their kinda deep dish square-cut pepperoni pizza and after it cooled down a little, I found it to be VERY TASTY, nice burnt edges on pepperoni, nice cheese, nice crust. I will be back when I'm around there. Loud music dive bar but food is good and prices are fair......... I'm Jonesing for their pizza and wings now!!!!"}
{"text":"\"It hurts so good!\" I cry to myself as I take another bite of the suicide fries!  Wow, what a roller coaster ride that was!  The hot sauce was just a teaser of what was to come.  Then came the habanero peppers... And then the tears.  Before I knew it , I had run out of water and had to get more from the self serve water jug by the entrance.  Thank goodness it was self serve because I don't think I would have made it if I had to wait for a waiter to grab me more!  Protip: There is no waiter!    Yes, this restaurant is located in a dive bar.  Yes, you have to be 21 to eat here. YES, you have to drag your ass to the window to order or else you will wait for service only to have the bartender ask what the hell you're doing.  And yes, you will have to grab your plates, silverware, and waters right by the entrance.  Don't let these things deter you from trying some of the best pizza you will ever have in Las Vegas.  Although, of course the pizza is famous, you have to get some fries or wings to start!  Did I mention how great the fries were???"}
{"text":"Me and my husband tried the pizza here last Saturday and it's the bomb!! This place is inside Moondoggies Bar which were at to watch a football game. They not only have pizza but also salads, sandwiches, appetizers and so on.. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Brought my grandma to Vegas and swung by here to have her try the pie and fries. She not a fan of pizza at all bit had 4 slices of the guineas pies and loved it. She also enjoyed the suicide fries!"}
{"text":"Ha!  We almost missed this place because it's literally a  dive bar where no one under 21 is allowed inside, no windows, etc.  We ordered inside at a little window, then went over to the bar and had a Tenaya Creek Las Vegas beer on tap and a Tokyo Tea.  The bartender Jennifer was a hoot!  The Cesar salad was my favorite dish.  We had a small order of the suicide fries (thank gawd we got the small size, because it burned my mouth and we were all crying, so a small dose is much better)......we all liked them.  Then we had the chicken wings, hot, and they were great.  We got a slice of pizza, which had mushrooms and steak on top, but the crust is like bread, thick dough.   We came for the pizza and liked that least of all.  We are glad we came, it's a fun bar, super friendly, but I wouldn't go back, once was enough.  Everyone should try the suicide fries once in their life!"}
{"text":"This might be my new little lunch spot. It's right around he corner from work and it has more options than just pizza . My naked salad was so good , roasted peppers and marinated tomatoes not your average boring salad , have to come back and try the fries and the pizza ! I love all the cool artwork , it's a casual little chill spot."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service where's the old school workers at ....This girl with colored hair dye was just rude ridiculous and zero patriot customers I miss the old workers"}
{"text":"Struggle is real. I ordered the smallest pizza they had -- the 1/4 sheet. It's really just for me and LOOK HOW MUCH THERE IS.  I went ahead and ordered the Guinea Pie; they are famous for it so you kind of have to pull that trigger. This place is awesome. You kind of don't see it at first because it is inside this dive bar. You gotta be 21+ to walk in but just go for it and order at the small window on the left as you walk along the bar. I ordered an IPA during the wait and the pizza came sooner than I expected. I meant to take it to-go but I'm finishing this beer, eating a couple squares and finishing this review. It's a perfect solo spot or low key place to hang out."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza spots in town.  I normally sit in Moondoggies for the beer and atmosphere.  You do have to go to the small window to order your food and they will bring it out to you.     I'm a big fan of the traditional pizzas with red sauce and my favorite here is the Back Home Pizza which has crisp cup pepperoni, Italian sausage, a garlic crust, parmesan and mozzerella mixed with red sauce.  It is very flavorful and the wee size is more than enough for 2 people.    One evening I was feeling very confident and attempted the suicide wings.  They were super hot I felt like Ben Stiller in Along Came Polly I just wanted to power thru the heat and couldn't believe they felt hotter and hotter as I went on and on and on to the next one.  So if you ever want to go out like a blister in the sun give them a try your tongue and lips may never forgive you thou... hahaha   Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Came back today and I love this place again. Found out the reason we never had a waitress last time is because they don't have them anymore. You order at the window  towards the back of the bar. The friendly bartender explained it to us."}
{"text":"I can't express the joy by taste buds feel when I come to Naked city pizza. I've been coming here for YEARS and I've never found any other pizza as good as Naked city. The Poutine Fries are to Die for (my mouth is watering) the gravy it come in is made there, they add chunks of Mozzarella and they season the fries to perfection. I'm old school when it comes to pizza so I typically have Pepperoni and cheese but I have also had a few others. One of my favorite is the Back Home Pizza it has Mozzarella, Pepperoni and Italian Sausage, the pepperoni has a perfect crunch around the edges, the Italian sausage is has the perfect amount of seasoning and the Mozzarella is stringy how a cheese should be. I don't know how they do it but the food in all the years I've been here is consistent and never disappoints. P.S. they have cheap drinks and who doesn't love cheap drinks??? If you haven't given this place a shot you are missing out on some great pizza."}
{"text":"\"I didn't know it was a take and bake pizza.\"   I took a bite of the crust as I love a good crust and that bite was really yeasty/doughy. I looked at the dough where I bit and was still translucent so therefore still raw. I grabbed from the other side of the pizza my 2nd slice, without crust. That was cooked, but still needed to be baked for a better consistency. I looked carefully at the pizza and the dough was rolled unevenly so the sloppy base made for the uneven cook. Like Angela stated about the sauce- she had a slice with no sauce and I had a slice that I could see the sauce present without digging for it.   Shouldn't have to re-bake or watch each bite for raw spots when Angela H and I were plenty happy to wait 20 minutes to get a 'za but could wait longer if it meant not rushing to get it done. I looked at the crust on peoples pictures and can see those are brown and toppings like pepperoni are crisping at the edges. Just so people don't think I'm just looking for something to hate (though my review pattern is rarely negative) please look at the pictures. I posted a piece of pizza with all the toppings off so you can see the crust thickness change and the pale pizza crust and bottom. I'm sure some people will say \"it's just a bad day\" but uneven pizza dough and sauce is careless and seeing the crust isn't even brown but choosing to box it up anyways isn't the pride and quality control I'd expect from a raved about place. Yes, I cook some shit wrong, made a new recipe and it sucked- not for lack of care but inexperience. I've cooked certain things over and over (like you do at a restaurant) and can keep a decent standard on such items because I baby it and won't serve what isn't at least cooked well.    It LOOKED good, SMELLED good on the drive back home, the toppings were quality, but if you don't have the dough down right, cooked right then it isn't a fucking pizza. Might as well put those toppings on some sandwich rolls so I can enjoy the nicely spice-y sausage bits, red pepper, olives and pepperoni. Grease doesn't bother me too much, but just a note there was a good amount of it to dab off. $17 for a large and the only consolation I suppose is the groupon. Also we got cheese bread which gives me visions of dough bits with cheese. We got a sandwich roll stuffed with some cheese, mostly spinach and chopped garlic. I'd be cool with a spinach sandwich but it needed more seasonings other than the garlic so it was just A-OK.   The settings really don't help. Neither of us was aware of what Moondoggies was about and partly wasn't sure if we have the right place without any pizza indicators on the outside. Odd that there isn't even a little sign... Alright, odd that it's in a bar, but I can dig it like how some  PTs have Robertos tacos attached. It's not quite separate but connected to the bar situation, but just a window on the wall of the bar where you can order.  It was just an odd vibe for two ladies to walk into a bar full of men with a few stopping to look at what we were doing. Odd vibes and no real seating aside from the bar or pool table, we hightailed our plans of staying in and took it to-go. Takes a lot to make two loud, social with all kinds of people kind of bitches want to just go home instead of stay in a environment. It wouldn't have been a place we could have comfortable conversation.   I don't get the hype. I don't know about second chances with this one."}
{"text":"Bomb wings and pizza so delicious best of all great customer service seats were very confortable great place for the family or for hangout ."}
{"text":"I ordered as a first timer here thinking it was gonna be mind-blowing!!! I mean, chicken fingers on pizza?! You can't mess that up! Welllllllll I guess you can. The pizza was bland, not enough marinara. The dough was undercooked (even though it took 50 minutes to prepare) and the chicken fingers...they were more like chicken pieces half cooked on the pizza. It was just missing something! I also ordered suicide fries! I love spicy food. I order a 10 in Indian and Thai food and eat grilled peppers as a snack. But these fries were tasteless. They were JUST spicy. They taste as if someone just poured hot sauce and threw on some jalapeños. Nothing special. Overall I gave them two stars because they are creative with their menu and all these things can definitely be improved. One day I will try this place out again, but not anytime soon if they continue like this!"}
{"text":"Dark, loud and smoky, but that didn't bother me, so much as the fact that our server (who was very sweet) put in our drink order and it took upwards of 30 minutes to get 3 diet cokes, a sprite, 3 waters and 2 beers. That was the first sign that we were in trouble. We ordered 2 wee pizzas and then one of the really big ones split between two flavors (the Naked City and the Guinea). The kitchen reportedly messed up and made those as two separate medium sized pizzas (not a big deal at all) except that they forgot about the Guinea all together, so they made one for us about an hour and a half into the experience. Then another server took our fresh pizza and took it to another table, so then that had to make another. We actually never got the original order until after we had paid and were walking out the door three hours into the journey. We brought home the Guinea and reheated it for dinner and it was awesome. Fries are solid and would definitely recommend the Guinea pizza. Not so much for the overall experience."}
{"text":"My son recommended this place.  I think I had it bookmarked though.  So as I was getting my hustle on, I was in the area, and I had time to swing by and get a slice of pizza.  So I got there right on time, there pizza for single serve just came out.  So I paid for my slice of pizza, and told the girl, I was going to wash my hands.  So they have this little bitty window inside the bar for the food.  When I came back someone was at the window ordering there complicated pizza.  I'm waiting, and waiting.  I think she could have just told them, hey, let me hand her, her pizza.   Buttttt Nooooooo, I had to wait for this complicated order to be completed before I got my 1 slice of pizza that I already paid for.   Then she didn't hand me any napkins!  I was already pressed for time, and I told her that when I saw that the pizza came out.   Thank goodness it was still hot!  The cheese was cheesy, and the pizza was really good.  This place is quite far from my home, so I don't see me ordering a large.  I will just pop in when I'm in the area, and get a slice."}
{"text":"I guess if I was drinking... scratch that... if I was drunk the pizza would be AMAZING! But so would del taco. I had been to Moon Doggies years ago and thought it was a cool little dive bar and the food at Naked City Pizza fits right into that category. Dive bar food. Ordered the \"Back Home Pizza\" online (bonus points for easy online ordering!) and got the half sheet for $18. Pictures online and on Yelp looked pretty good. Was ready when I arrived (on time) and my small interaction with the person at the window was not enough to judge service. Soon as we walked out I opened box and knew I had probably made a mistake. This did not look as good as it did in the pics and it looked like cheap ingredients. I was right. I regretfully devoured 4 slices as I was pretty hungry. But that doesn't change the fact that I was wishing I had a better pizza to eat. I can't speak for the rest of the food there as this was all I got. They get 3 stars only because its fair (I guess) for the price and its in a dive bar so I shouldn't have expected as much as I did. Drunk food is all I can say it is at this point."}
{"text":"Home of the guinea pie, which was featured on triple D!  So this place is kind of uninviting. It is inside Moondoggies bar, which is dark and musty. Adults only kind of place, so leave the kids at home (or go to the other location...).  For drinks, I ordered the loganberry because I have never had anyting loganberry. Server said it was pretty popular in New York.  It was hard to describe the taste, but most like a watered down berry juice. Next time I'll just have some \"pop.\"  I shared the small size Guinea pie with Ramil B. and it was the perfect size for us.  It was cut in 6 pretty good size pieces and I was still able to take 2 pieces home to the husband who loved it.  The pizza here is definitely a winner and I would come back to order it again!  Some great things about it are the homemade meatballs and the ricotta cheese!  Kind of on the greasy side, but crust was on point.   We were curious about dessert and ordered the fried dough, which was a humongous portion that I just took it home.  This was OK, not worth ordering. It simply was fried, drizzled with chocolate syrup and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Nothing exciting here.  Pizza deserves 4 stars, but everything else was just OK."}
{"text":"AMAZING! This place is a hidden secret in Las Vegas. Amazing pizza and drinks! One of the top pizza spots, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've never been to Buffalo, never ridden a buffalo, never had a Buffalo style pizza, but I can sure say I can make this place my home on the range. Located inside the dive bar that is Moon Doggies. So, right off the bat, if you are looking for a cute frou frou type place, it ain't happening here. This is about the pizza. So, \"The Fatboy\" was ordered--half sheet. Thanks to Pete's speedy review and pics, I was able to call in the order, giddy up. As is the protocol, if you want to eat inside Moon Doggies, you pick up your \"to go\" order, and pull up a table to enjoy your pie, that skirts the smoking law, yes smoking takes place here. You have 2 options, deal with it, or really take it to go. As soon as we cracked open the square box, the aroma of tomatoes and fresh basil completely infiltrated our mind, body and soul. OMFG, the pizza was astonishing. It seems to me NY pizza is kind of favored here in Vegas. This is not the same thing at all. The crust is thicker, a little soft with slightly crispy edges. It is all loaded with plenty of groceries, and I mean quality items too. WOW! Perfect ratio of crust, to sauce, to toppings. Check this out, we did not ask for, nor did we need any extra parmesan or red pepper flakes. The sauce is zesty, with a welcome kick. Daily doses of \"The Fatboy\" could keep me from being slim. The pizza itself is 5 star!"}
{"text":"I don't usually hang with squares, but when I do they come from this place...  A full sheet is 24 slices and the generous amount of toppings on a pie of that size easily wiped out a garden and slaughtered a couple hogs. Unless I'm up against a bet you can take my yelp tagline and toss it. The in-house meatballs and pepperoni they use are top notch, the dough is a perfect texture and taste, the quality cheese is plentiful (see pics of my guinea pie) and it eats well the next day...(5 minutes at 350 followed by 2 minutes at 400 to get it nice and crispy with a perfect melt). If you want a tasty pie, you can't go wrong with the Rebel (used to be called the Fat Boy) or the Guinea pie which was featured on Diners, Drive ins and Dives.  Other unique items I've tried were the poutine fries, which were excellent, as were the pizza logs. Got to love the creative menu of delicious bar food made using quality ingredients.  They also stay open til 3am which is conveniently dangerous for the waistline.   A strong four stars...be sure to check them out."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious and their chicken fingers are more chicken than bread; that's always a huge plus. Good prices and huge portions"}
{"text":"Pie is pretty good. Nothing much to say about the place, it's a dive bar, and a dive restaurant. If you're into that, you'll love it here. But this review is for the food! So far I've only had the chicken finger pie, the Back Home(get this one!), and the guinea pie. Definitely get the back home pie, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Omg this has to be the best pizza ever!!! You have to get the Guinea pizza and for sure the wings. I have traveled all over the U.S. and I continue to do so. But my husband and I agree that this is seriously the best pizza we have ever had. The wings are a must and you have to get them HOT flavored. So good and so yumny. Also, their beer is on tap freezing ice cold. It will be the best beer you had because of how cold they keep their"}
{"text":"amazing, amazing, amazing!  The food here is sooooo good.  If you like wings, pizza and garlic knots then this is your spot.   I like spicy so I came to get everything with suicide.  The wings, fries and pizza were amazing."}
{"text":"I saw this place on triple D, and it lived up to the hype! We had the \"Back Home Pie\" in the \"Frickin' Huge size, it fed 8 hungry guys."}
{"text":"It is easy to drive by this place,as the main sign is for the bar,as the pizza joint is inside the bar.. Which was very smoky,dark and a few locals hanging out. The cook was actually doing his paperwork at the bar,so he looked like one of the patrons? Anyway the food is ok, just too smoky to wit for your pizza and wings to go,as I would not sit and eat there,unless you like hanging out in a smoky,smoky,stinky bar,it just doesn't make the food taste good.. Staff was friendly, but I don't think I will go bk.. More on their food- i did not get a pizza,but opt for wings, it was ok,nothing to write home about it. The portion are average, about the same for all places that serve wings and pizza.. It was hard to find the place because the sign for naked city pizza was very small and un -noticeable.As you see the reviews they are mixed and I cannot say it would be 4 or 5 stars either.. I got wings,because I was in a hurry to get in and out of there,,maybe if I ever go back I would try the pizza?"}
{"text":"Not good..first time and I got almost burnt fries with my over toasted Italian 3 meat sub, cause I requested it be toasted? Hope their Pizzas are better? Sorry guys..get it together! I really couldn't eat the fries. If they weren't so burnt to a crisp, the seasoning I could tell was good tho.."}
{"text":"I ordered The Rachael. A few highlights: spicy pickle, giardiniera, big roll, tasty turkey, nice name. The shop is teeny with a bit of outdoor seating. In fact, the pinnacle of Las Vegas-style patio dining just might be at Naked City. If you know Las Vegas patio dining, you know it means overlooking a parking lot. Well, here you not only overlook the parking lot, you pretty much sit in it and also overlook OG. Sandwich, Strippers, Custard (at Luv- It's)--I have a feeling that is a common Friday trio, but not for Gabi and me. We stuck to the Naked City that was serving lunch.  I was a bit sad that the Naked Greens weren't baby greens and sadder that it took what I consider a long time to get our order. The turkey was definitely good and real. Overall, a solid sandwich, but I don't know if the thought of it lingers with me. I think that is the mark of an outta this world sandwich--a lingering thought. I find myself thinking mostly about the giardiniera. I love that stuff.   A solid three with promise of a return to try another sandwich."}
{"text":"Good size pizza for the price...dough is made in house, the sauce needed something. Overall good pizza watering hole!!"}
{"text":"This place is tough to find!  It's inside another bar.  When we finally got the nerve to go inside, we knew we were in the right spot.  No windows, just some funky mix and match tables and chairs.  The place was pretty crowded since apparently DDD was just on the night before.   The poor waitress was SWAMPED!  She was super nice but could have used some serious help.  We ordered the suicide fries.  It was a pretty large order.  There were just two of us and we struggled to finish them, mainly because of the heat.  We needed more ranch and water, but the poor waitress never came by.  We didn't even eat the peppers on top!  The sauce was spicy enough.  Don't get me wrong, they were really tasty.  We each got a slice of pizza.  I got the Specialty of the day, chicken parm and my friend got cheese.  Love the crust.  My one complaint would be that it is too much cheese.  I just pulled a little bit off.  I couldn't finish my one slice, it was plenty.  My friend raved that this was some of the best pizza she has had, and that's saying a lot coming from her.  We were glad we went!  Oh, and FYI, No kids allowed here."}
{"text":"We had seen this place on the food network and wanted to try it. Found the one closest to where we were staying, the Arville Rd location. It took us a while to figure out that it was inside of this bar, very hard to find. The bar was dark, dingy and smoky. We went in and left in a hurry. Bad location, would never go back."}
{"text":"Highly recommended by a friend who has  never been to Buffalo. Think Hertel Ave.   Waited forty minutes for our order which came on two trips 15 minutes  apart. Our order was wrong, the service was frustrating.  The pizza is tough and dry on the edges, kind of greasy in the middle and the dough is just ok. The toppings seem to be mediocre quality.   Ordered wings with medium sauce, received them drenched. Although I must say,  the wing sauce was authentic.  For $40.00 plus tip, I don't think NCP rates the attention it's receiving. It is a bar after all. For the money you spend here you will get a better quality meal and a more satisfying experience at the many high end pizzerias in the Vegas valley.  I would rather have a little \"Vanilla Thrilla\" ;)"}
{"text":"All I have to say is that this place is friggin awesome!  This place was on Diners, drive-ins, and dives.  So, I had to check it out!  Good service,  I got full AND took food home.  Nice portion sizes,  that's hard to find in Vegas.  Love it and coming back for more!!!!!! The wings were greattttt!!!"}
{"text":"More a rant than a review, the outlandish amounts of cash that Pharmaceutical Companies spend to bend Physicians' ears a sore subject for someone who has intentionally lived above the influence for nearly fifteen years, it was after implementing a whole new set of rules to restrict access that lunch was delivered by Christopher Palmeri on Friday, this one hour per week begrudgingly given at least filled with good Food.  Open since 1999 and the focus of over a dozen visits, everything from the original on Arville to Naked City Tavern and even Chef Palmeri's menu for Bacon Bar the subject of discussion at some point in the last four years, it was finally in late April that Naked City Pizza Delivery was experienced in the form of catering for twenty, the results expectedly not *quite* as good as fresh from the oven, though not far off either.   No doubt a fan of the Restaurant with four current locations, Michael and Chris' newest spot inside The El Cortez recently visited and soon to be enjoyed again for \"Paula's Supper Club\" on May 1st, it was to a smorgasbord of favorites that staff was treated, Caesar Salad with Housemade Dressing proving a popular choice for those looking for something light while Wings tossed to Medium spiciness were called \"the best I've ever tasted by one\" and \"not spicy enough\" by others.  Wowing skeptics next with Pizza Logs, the listed Pepperoni replaced with housemade Fennel Sausage to great effect  beneath  a crisp and golden Shell, it was from four 'half-sheets' of Pizza that attendees were allowed to pick, the two orders of Cheese selected by the Rep to 'be safe' largely leftover as staff found Naked City's DDD-famous Guinea Pie and Chicken Finger slices most enjoyable though the eponymous Pie with Onions and Roasted Peppers also proved popular for those who didn't worry about their breath for the second half of the day.  Rounding out the afternoon with Palmeri's best-in-Sin-City Cannolis, the normally filled-to-order shells holding up even better than Pizza Crust which has suffered just a touch of sog in transit, suffice it to say that all were more than satisfied by a lunch of good ingredients cooked by people who are putting their time, money and hard work on the line to do something they love...and if you happen to see a Social Media post suggesting Monkey Logs are available do not hesitate to place an order for them.  N/A:  In a city of two million with over forty million visitors annually it is probably no surprise that independently owned businesses often take a backseat in terms of advertising, but when considering options for catering nothing is more disappointing than the number of dollars being funneled into spots like BJ's, PF Chang's or Café Rio - money that would much better support Las Vegas' small businesses if people would just wake up and stop being so lazy."}
{"text":"My friend and I had to build up the courage to enter this seedy looking bar, and it was still daylight. This dive has some of the most innovative pizzas in Las Vegas. I love the Snake in the Grass Pizza and the loaded baked potato fries. It's no wonder Triple D did an episode at Naked City Pizza. My suggestion is place a to go order if you're not into the smokey bar scene."}
{"text":"Hmm suicide fries!! everyone around me knows am in for anything that is super spicy and hot! So when i seen suicide fries on DDD i said  \"that's the place i am gonna try\" believe me its all that and a bag of suicide  fries!!!!!!! So let me stop talking about the best spicy fries i have ever had and talk about the rest of  my visit!   My hunny and i were excited to visit this place so we did not let the negative yelps stop us from doing so, and boy were we happy!! The service was great the waitress gal who helped us was a pleasure and very informative, the beer was cheap and cold and my salad was super yummy with ingredients you don't find at your nearest dennys!  Now lets talk pizza when i heard ny buffalo u imagined ny pie, but nope the pizza is a thick crust with fresh ingredient and probably super yummy for the thick crust lovers, i don't care for thick crust so i don't want to judge the pizza based  upon my bias!  all together we loved this place and will be returning during our next  Vegas stop!!   wait i forgot to mention all ingredients are super fresh and your dish made to order!! and wait i forgot one more thing SUICIDE FRIES ROCK!!! hehe"}
{"text":"Bianco Pizza- mozzarella, fontina, and parmesan cheese due business with some rich and creamy ricotta cheese and a housemade garlic sauce that will blow you away.  Better yet, its a classic brick oven style rectangular pie.  Pizza is a must here.  If you are really up to the challenge, bring along a few buddies that don't mind a little spice in their life, take down an order of fries or Buffalo wings made by a chef from Buffalo, New York covered in their super spicy 'SUICIDE' sauce.  This stuff is addictive, you will not want to stop eating them but once you do, the after burn is worse than the initial heat.  May need a beer or two to cool this inferno inside your body.    Great place to stop in if in the area or if you would just like to step away from the craziness of the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"Place is a true dive. Dark and a little dingy and had the feel of a place that attracts locals and regulars. The bartender was very friendly and overall I felt comfortable,  I had 2 pieces of pizza by the slice:  Pepperoni slice: Wasn't very good at all. You don't expect pizza by the slice to be fresh so I was willing to overlook the fact that it tasted old, but I don't think that it was originally a pepperoni pizza. It looked and tasted like it was a slice of cheese pizza that they just threw some pepperoni on top of and heated up because the pepperoni wasn't heated through like it should've been had it spent as much time in the oven as the rest of the pizza.  Chicken Parm (slice of the day): This was actually pretty good besides the fact that it too, tasted like it had been out a long time. The crust that they use is a little thicker than I prefer but the breaded chicken on it was tasty.   Philly cheesesteak rolls: First off they give you 4 big rolls for 7 bucks which is an awesome value. The first bite wasn't overly impressive but these things are addicting and get better with every bite. Crispy egg roll shell, steak, onions and peppers, and cheddar some how come together into this crunchy, savory, and cheesy bite of goodness.  Chicken Fingers: Looking at them I thought they may be frozen but they tasted fresh and very good. Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside covered in a tasty buffalo sauce.  Overall, I liked my meal. I'm not going to be extra critical on the pizza that I knew wouldn't be fresh. The prices are very reasonable, food was tasty, people were friendly. I'd go back but would try fresh pizza ;)."}
{"text":"Food still solid after all these years. Gunea Pie is excellent! Beef on Weck is an excellent sandwich as long as they are not skimpy with the juice (buy some bigger to go containers).... which is my only complaint.  Bit pricey but excellent."}
{"text":"Naked City Pizza serves up tasty pies, fries, wings, and specialities.  NPC is located inside Moondoggies, a smoke-filled dive bar. you order at the little window, which you can't miss since it's lined with all their prestigious awards.  That's just it, this place is all about the hype. Yes, it's a decent pie, but the toppings were sparse. The pizza also isn't anything that you can't find elsewhere and it just doesn't stand out. It's good, but not great and definitely not remember-able.   Where NCP excels is in the sammie & fry departments. There are unique offerings and tasty combos. Suicide fries offer a mighty kick and are best served with milk to kill the fire. Not for the faint of heart. My go to sub is The Guinea which as a pizza is meh; when translated to sandwich is crave-able. (I'm salivating as I write this!) With it's combination of house-made Italian sausage, sweet and hot peppers, onion and ooey-gooey mozzarella cheese! This is a sandwich worth driving across town for.   I also had one of the best Osso Buco of my life here. It was a weekly special and it was tender and juicy.   Although they claim pizza in their title, their best items can be found elsewhere on the menu."}
{"text":"So far I've turned my son, my mother, and other close friends and family onto Naked City Pizza. Best dive bar in town. We all cannot come to Vegas without stopping in for Fat Boy and wings. This place is a must try, I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Naked City Pizza is a smoky dive bar that happens to serve up some pretty tasty pizzas! We enjoyed a very good pizza with pepperoni, sausage, roasted pepper, onion, olives, mozzarella and red sauce. The pizza was fired in a brick oven and the crust was great. The pizza logs were also very good. Service was excellent. Prompt and friendly. Naked City seems like a good place to get some eats, have a drink, and hang-out."}
{"text":"Tried to order online for delivery but the site was down. Ok, no problem, I called instead to place the order. They said delivery can only be arranged if you ordered online. I explained that the site wasn't working, which is why I called in the first place, and asked if they could arrange the delivery anyway. The woman on the phone was exceptionally rude, saying \"Lady, I just told you it wasn't possible\". Annoyed, I said fine. By this point though she said she didn't have time for this and hung up on me! Wow - I'm so disappointed and will avoid this place going forward. Too bad."}
{"text":"Great pizza, plain and simple. High quality ingredients with a lot of flavor. We got the Guinnea's Pie. Pizza with Meatballs, and spinach. It was phenomenal. We also got the stuffed peppers. Way too much food but with keeping the leftovers.   I have to admit, the fact that it is located in a bar was a plus. I love dive bars so I enjoyed the vibe. It was also a nice change of pace to be in a kid free environment for a little bit."}
{"text":"I have friends that seem to frequent this place rather often.  I often see posts about them going there, without me, and I will be honest I get a little agitated. I have to tell myself that them getting it at 10pm or later is a good reason for me not to feel too bad about being excluded, but it stings.   Maybe I have low standards for atmosphere, but I just do not care how a place looks as long as they produce good quality food and I am not in immediate danger of getting shanked. It is true that this establishment is located in a poorly light bar, but the drinks are cheap and the food more than makes up for it.  I have only been there once, and I can only think about how delicious the Guinea's pie was. For me, the true test of a pizza is whether I am willing to eat it's crust. I am not a huge fan of crust because it can be too doughy or dry. With Naked City Pizza, I found that I was not a particular fan of the middle slices of the rectangular pizza because there was no contrast to the gooey toppings. This would be one of the first times that I did not force myself to eat the crust and just enjoyed it.   The wings, I love wings and seem to always be in the mood for them. Ordering with friends that do not handle spicy food too well, we decided to go with hot instead of suicide. I found them to be delicious, although not as fiery as I would like. They still proved too hot for the sensitive individuals in our party, so watch out. When I get the chance I would hope to try the suicide and confirm if they are something to write about.   We also had the cobb salad in a vain attempt to justify everything else we ordered. The crispy cuts of bacon, chunks of blue cheese and dressing was just a reminder of how delusional we were.   The meal might not have been the healthiest thing for us, but it was delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"Don't know of anything else here but their pizza is damn good. It's not the traditional round pie, it's square but it doesn't have super thick crust like Sicilian pizza.  We get the medium size which is called \"Not So Wee\", good size for dinner plus left overs. We've tried the \"Fat Boy\"  with Salami, pepperoni, ham, Italian sausage, roma tomato, mozzarella cheese, fresh basil and red sauce.   If you like a meaty pie, this is for you! Our latest order was for \"The Stinger\" with Chicken fingers, sirloin steak, mozzarella cheese, cheddar cheese, bleu cheese, sweet and hot peppers and onions. I could actually do without the steak, it was more like the meat you get on a cheesesteak, it didn't do much for the taste. We got the fingers on the pie with medium hot sauce, it was yummy. I dipped mine in some ranch dressing. I dig this pie.  We order by phone for pick up, it takes a bit of time to make these massive pies so don't expect it to be done in 15 minutes. Staff is friendly and helpful. Seems like a popular place to hang out on the weekends, parking lot is packed when we've gone."}
{"text":"Saw the promo on Dinners Drive ins and Dives.  Don't know what the fuzz was!  Was just OK!  BTW, GPS indicated there were two pizzerias.   One we went to was a bar/pizzeria.  I don't like the bar scene so this was a let down for me."}
{"text":"I'm from buffalo ny, and this is a buffalo themed bar. They have a menu dedicated to the bar foods and amazing foods of buffalo. I tried the chicken wings which were spot on and reminded me more of duffs wings than anything and I loved them. The pizza was just OK, they had the grease cups which are the norm on buffalo branded pizza shops.. however if I was in Buffalo I would rank it low on the pizza scale. We tried the poutine which is fries with gravy and cheese curds and that was delicious. Also the stinger sub which was also delicious and reminded me of the big sloppy subs of the wny areas. The also had local drink favorites such as loganberry drink and of course Labatt blue beer. I still gotta go back and try the tacos as they have a dedicated taco shop next door. Give this place a try soon."}
{"text":"Naked City Pizza Shop, hidden inside Moon Doggies Bar.    I've been to Moon Doggies a few times over the years.  It's a nice dive bar with real character.  It's a good change in a town where it's hard to find such places.  Going here is a little intimidating the first time around, but definitely a fixture to this city.  Naked City is a welcomed addition to Moon Doggies; the previous pizza place that leased the kitchen was not that great and left the watering hole void of food offerings for a few years.    This was my 2nd visit to Naked City, and we just can't seem to get away from the daily specials that the chef has to offer.  (The chef is also the owner, waiter, delivery driver, and busser)    The special on our first visit was a hot roast beef dip.  The thing that set this apart from your average French Dip was the addition of horse radish sauce and a roll seasoned and toasted like garlic bread.  This was excellent.  The beef was also unique; it was roasted in house and cut thick, but still remained tender.  I hope this special becomes a regular item.  The second visit we tried the pulled pork Bolognese.  Extremely flavorful, but may be too bold for some.  This was a deliciously refined dish, much too soigne to be served in a dive bar.  However, this fancy plate of pasta fit perfectly with the approach of Naked City, offering unexpectedly great food in a blue collar setting.    We also tried a few of the regular menu items between the past two visits:  The medium wings were very flavorful, but had a sweet note to them.  I'm a simple guy when it comes to me, so it wasn't my cup of tea.  The garlic knots were excellent, I really recommend.  The \"Naked City\" Pizza is very well executed.  We also tried the Poutine.  The Poutine is a must have and needs to go on everyone's bucket list as a must try before they die.  Naked City is losing a star for the location.  Food is amazing, but the neighborhood is a little scary, and the bar is extremely smoky.  I must also warn everyone, do NOT order soda from the bar, I don't think they have every changed or cleaned their soda lines in 20 years.  Stick with the hard liquor or beer."}
{"text":"We had the 1/4 sheet Guinea pie and the suicide fries that were featured on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives. I don't usually (let's just say can't handle spicy food) eat super spicy food, but I just wanted to give the fries a try. $5.00 for a small fries which is like a super large at most or almost all fast food fries. It was spicy but I was able to handle it. I can't say much about the Guinea Pie because my taste buds were over powered by the hotness of the fries. However, I do have left overs.   I was disappointed that they don't have fountain drinks, had to get a can of coke. Nothing wrong with it, but by the time my food came out my coke was warm and there's no ice. I like my drinks ice cold. Also, expect to wait, I ate at the family side not at the bar. As we wait for our food, our server goes in and out of the restaurant and to the bar to drop off orders and pick up food."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Lousy business. They just decided to stop serving at 11pm.  Major fail.  This town is a 24 hr town. I've made a ritual of getting naked city pizza at least 2 times a month after work. I work second shift. Off at 1130 pm.  Wtf!  This will hurt MoonDoggie's bar business too.  It's just bad business.  Basically a F U to anyone on second shift!! I've seen this literally kill other badly managed business here in Vegas. At l say stay open till 1am or 2!!   Who is this lazy and stupid?"}
{"text":"Love their pizza best in Vegas, I snap chatted pics, we live in North Las Vegas but will come way over here to order and drive back home"}
{"text":"Update review. Haven't been here in a year or so so we decided to have some late night pizza over at Naked City. We ordered Back Home Pie, chicken wings and Paper Bag Zeppoles. The Back Home Pie was greasy as hell, omg I broke out looking at it, the crust was good but the sauce just soaked up all of the center pieces. I had one piece and that's all I could swallow. The chicken wings were average. The Paper Bag Zeppoles were gross and we threw it out. The costumer service was great, but probably won't be ordering the Back Home Pie or Paper Bag Zeppoles again. Now I have heart burn along with a broken heart.   Update #3: Maybe... third times the charm? Um... nope from 2 to 1 star. And it really sucks because I really wanted to love this place.  I wanted to tell my friends this was an awesome spot to go to. We ordered a pizza to bring to a friend's house warming party but it was mistakenly made at the wrong location. One thing which would have solved this problem was when they answered the phone they followed their greeting with the location. Once we went to pick up our pizza they explained to us that they didn't have it and they wanted us to drive to the other location to get it. We weren't going to drive 30 minutes out of our way to get the pizza so we wanted to reorder the pizza. The guy refused to make us the pizza... told us he was wasting product. I want to point out that his reaction was of a man who had this kind of thing happen to him all of the time. They also had a slice of the day deal and they could have easily sold the other pizza. We ended up going to metro pizza.   I don't know why we keep on trying to go here. The place is filled with smoke because they are located in a bar. I think they are separate because I always get good service from the bartender. I'm an ex-smoker so I am extra sensitive to the smoke."}
{"text":"Well I specifically picked this place because it was featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  The show featured the Suicide Fries and the Guinea's Pie (Pizza Pie that is).  My husband had the Chicken Finger Pie and I tried the Guinea's Pie b/c I love sausage, spinach and cheese.  This pie is on a delicious chewy crust with a little bit more than a hint of garlic but not too much.  The in-house sausage was good but the combination was just OK.  I think the sauce is creamy enough but no real taste.  Needed a little something.  My husbands Chicken Finger pie was also tasty but not spectacular.  My enjoyment of the pizza was ruined by the smokey smell.  The place is inside a bar,which is dark and kinda icky.  You can't bring your family here b/c children are not allowed in a bar.  I wouldn't go back.  I have followed a lot of DDD featured restaurants and this one did not live up to the hype.  Nice wait staff....not too slow."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious.  I normally do not like hot wings.  But they were really good. Nice,  and crispy! My kids loved it so much. They want to go back before we head back to Cali!"}
{"text":"Don't judge a place by it's cover, once we got past the outside and our eyes adjusted inside it was a fun little dive to eat at.  The food is delicious.  My husband and I decided to visit NCP after it was featured on TV and it was worth it.  The servings are huge, believe me you want as small as you can get.  We weren't going to get an appetizer, but our waitress suggested the fries and they were delicious.  The pizza was great too, especially the garlic crust, we would definitely go back again. We had great service and enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"I just love this place so much. It never gets old. My absolute favorite Pizza joint in all of Las Vegas. Not cheap but everything is cooked from scratch with quality natural fresh ingredients that you can really taste. It is in this funky dive bar place called Moon Doggies but dont let that put you off. The staff is super polite, efficient and the service is always excellent as is the food here.  :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza ; had the Guinea pie which was a nice mix of ingredients. The 1/2 sheet is big enough for 2-3 people.  Don't be scared by the location of this place , nice atmosphere with friendly staff.  (Inside a dive bar).   Will have to visit again to try another pie."}
{"text":"Note: There is more than one location.  I *believe* this is the one that was on DDD.  The other reviews are accurate.  The place is a dive bar, and the bar and pizza bills are separate.  There is a seating area with some video games and a vending machine that sells candy and cigarettes (yes there is a sign on the front door saying nobody under 21 allowed).    The pizza is really great, I got the Guinea (the 'wee' size and it was more than enough for me).  Service is very slow and harried, even in the middle of the day in the middle of the week.  Come here if you are not in a rush.  As I said, the pizza is really great.   I hit this as part of a DDD's tour of the area and I am glad I did.  I would come back with friends if I had a lot of time.  I ate at Naked City around 1PM for lunch and it was still pretty slow,"}
{"text":"This place is horrible and the service is bad well let me rephrase that , not! no service, we sat there for about 15 mins and no one even acknowledge that we were there, no water was offer and the employees didn't even speak to us, so we walked out and never coming back to this place, I have no idea what all the hype is about coming here, heard it was a good place to try but they were wrong!"}
{"text":"The pizza here tasted terrible! Probably a hotpocket or even little caesar's pizza would've tasted better than this. I order the pepperoni pizza and barely finished one sliced because the crust/ bread tasted like nothing. ABSOLUTELY BLAND!"}
{"text":"Bookmarked this place for our Vegas visit during Labor Day weekend after seeing in on DDD, and it did not disappoint!  This review is for our  food \"to-go\" since we had the kids with us and the bar does not allow anyone under 21.  Also, the bar allows smoking, so even if we could, I don't think we would've dined inside.   We ordered the \"Fatboy\" pizza which is a meat-lovers dream!!!  I highly recommend it.  We also ordered a wee-size \"Pizza Bianco\" which was a dissapointment - I'd tried better versions.  But the star of all stars is the \"Suicide Fries\" as it definitely lived up to the DDD hyped!  I will definitely make an effort to order from this place next time we're in Vegas and look forward to trying other selections."}
{"text":"I would rate them lower if Yelp would let me. I had their pizza once and it was great. However their service is the worst ever. I was craving pizza and I don't often get it let along pizza this pricy but tonight I thought why not. I called no less than ten times and got a busy signal. Someone finally answered and the asked if I could hold a moment. That turned into a 20 minute hold. I finally got upset and hung up I guess they don't need business. I called a nearby competitor and they answered right away and took my order gladly by the way they have a higher Yelp rating. I run a large hotel and could refer business to naked city but after the horrible service I will not recommend. Sad their product is great but either the workers don't care or there is not enough help causing the worst ever service."}
{"text":"This menu is a fat kid's dream come true!!!!!!  Just look at some of the combos and toppings they got on these pizzas!!  This comes pretty close to last meal/end of the world type food for me.    If you have a \"cheat day\" on your schedule, you might want to make it a \"cheat week\" after ingesting all these glorious calories, saturated fat and cholesterol at one sitting.  We ordered a full Royal sandwich and the wee (smallest) Guinea pie which is really not wee at all could feed 3 Japanese people for lunch alone.    I now know why The Royal was rated one of the best sandwiches in Vegas last year by LV Weekly.  I loved how they just made the Italian sausage into one huge patty layered with all this cappicola and mozzarella.  A total flavor explosion!  The Guinea pie was equally as awesome with meatballs, spinach and cheese, cheese, cheese.  I really liked the thick crust.    We had no shot at finishing everything but they made for some great leftovers the next day.  Tons of other menu items I look forward to having like \"The Stinger\" which features chicken fingers, steak, three cheeses, hot & sweet peppers, blue cheese and lettuce in one sandwich!!  What??????  That's Man vs Food type shiznit right there!  I also dug all the rock music they played in the bar.  Service was very friendly too.  This is also a Buffalo Bills bar so be warned."}
{"text":"Best Pizza I've had in Vegas!! bar none, hands down. Wings were hot yet eatable, Been living in Vegas about a month and a half now and this place has it all from good music playing, very chill environment to eat some great food. I  would give it a 5 stars only if they added more beer on tap."}
{"text":"Oh my this place is a diamond in the ruff..amazingly deelish food!!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent product, $33 bucks for a large pizza and you never know what you're going to get I ordered 3 times now and the pizza has been thick crust the first time, the second time someone must have dropped the container of red pepper flakes in the sauce insanely over the top spicy and the third time I received a thin crust with no sauce. It sounds crazy but true. This place claims it's a Buffalo Pizza shop, I lived in Buffalo for 20 years, this joint would never make it anyplace in WNY"}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious. The crust is light and buttery. We also tried the suicide fries. Wow, very hot but so good. Even though your mouth is burning, the flavor is so good."}
{"text":"My husband teases this is the whole reason we drove 6 hours to Las Vegas.  Their meatball pizza is beyond amazing.  Don't let the dive-ey appearance turn you away, this place is a gem.  Pizza is rectangle and hubby and I fight over the corner pieces.  Honestly the best pizza ever."}
{"text":"So good. We eat here every time we are in town. The Bianca is amazing and so are the Suicide Fries"}
{"text":"The food was decent but while I waited 20 minutes for the food I ordered 20 minutes in advance before I got here I asked the bartender very nicely if I could have a glass of water (prepared to tip her $5-10 since obviously you're not charging me for water. With a ridiculous attitude, as if I was bothering her, she told me to \"just give her a second\". Then sat there on her phone, followed by asking every single patron at the bar if they needed anything. I mean, really? It's a desert. It was 117 today, and I'm bothering you asking for a water when I just spent $40 dollars at your resteraunt? Yeah - me and my people will never be spending our money in this dive again."}
{"text":"(If you're at a hotel, use Postmates to have them deliver to you)  + Friendly phone-service + Not bad of a price for what you get!  My group and I were in Vegas for EDC weekend, and were staying at the Vdara. While this establishment doesn't deliver, you can use a 3rd party service called Postmates to have the pizza/food delivered to you.. even if you stay at a hotel! I didn't know any of this until the employee told me about this. The whole system worked really well!  We ordered the super big pizza, I forgot which.. but it came out to around $45? Not bad really if everyone is putting in. The pizza got to us in a timely manner and it tasted REALLY good. Next time we're in town, no doubt I'd be here ordering from them again. Thanks for keeping us full!"}
{"text":"Sketchy as can be. This is a place for drunk/high people to come play video games and eat pizza. This isn't a place for tourists who \"want to find something local.\" Avoid this place, especially during lunch when only one employee is here and the service sucks. Also, the pizza is no better than a hot pocket. Save your time and money eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delicious food! During my most recent visit, I shared a large order of loaded potato fries and a 1/4 sheet Guinea Pie with a friend. I would recommend both of those dishes to any and everyone. The crust on their pizzas is amazing - like soft garlic bread. The environment is really casual. We had Renee as our waitress and she was funny and attentive. Definitely a place to try."}
{"text":"Not the best pizza in the world, nor the worst. Definitely something that I will not remember unless I come back and read this post and go, oh, I ordered pizza that night.  I really came here because I heard that they served poutine, which I first had eaten whilst in Canada on one of my many Detroit Adventures.  Poutine was good, no complaints, but again, much like the pizza, kind of forgettable. After this week is over, the chances I even remember the name of this place is slim to none. They were not good enough to remember and they were not bad enough to stand out."}
{"text":"Awesome service from the owner.  OPEN MIC COMEDY SHOW on Wednesdays for dinner.  What an awesome idea!!  RadioVegas.Rocks put on a great comedy show.  Was a fantastic evening and a great price for all the food I ate and brought home.   Chopped salad was incredible!!!!  Pizza was kick ass and that buffalo chicken dip was worth fighting for.   SEE YOU NEXT WEDNESDAY!!!!"}
{"text":"1 star just because there is no option for zero.  Took forever and only to get the order wrong at the entire table.  No flavor and just not good at all.  I've never disliked a pizza ever and this place shut me down.  Way to expensive for any meal let alone bad food.  Was displeased from the start to the end.  It was so bad I just now decided to sign up for yelp just to make this post.  I'll take a $5 hot and ready before here.  Get Bent"}
{"text":"One of the better pizzas in Las Vegas. They have some great specialty pizzas to try. Good for grab-n-go. Having kids, we always have to go pick it up and take it home since it's in a bar."}
{"text":"Yum!!  So, we decided to order pizza at work and really wanted Naked City.  We'd heard so many great things about the pizza and were seriously salivating after looking at the menu online.  The location on Paradise is closest to us, so we tried to place an order online.  The website is horrible and wouldn't allow us to place an order, so I called.  Unfortunately, the person I spoke with was totally clueless. She said she didn't think they had a delivery driver yet and to call back in 15 minutes or to try the other (this) location.  So, I called the Arville location.  The young lady I spoke with was very friendly, but said that we were out of their delivery area.  I explained the situation and how the Paradise location had bascially said they couldn't help us, even though we are less than a mile from them.  The kitchen manager ended up getting on the line and she was awesome.  I explained to her what happened and she said that, although they typically don't deliver to our area, they would take our order and get everything straightened out.  We placed a fairly large order:  Pizza logs - Hand rolled egg roll wrappers stuffed with pepperoni, mozzarella and red sauce. These were good, but VERY greasy. Beware.  Also, the cheese was not evenly distributed and the red sauce was on the side (for some reason I expected it to be inside).  Guinea's Pie - Featured on Diners, Drive Ins & Dives Meatballs, spinach, ricotta, white garlic sauce and mozzarella cheese. VERY good.  Although I had to add red pepper flakes for a little spice.  Steak and Cheese Pizza - Sirloin steak, three cheese mix, sweet and hot peppers, onion and white garlic sauce. My favorite that we ordered! It was really good and super cheesy and the jalapeno added good heat.  Fatboy Pizza - Salami, pepperoni, ham, Italian sausage, roma tomato, mozzarella cheese, fresh basil and red sauce. My least favorite. Not because it was bad, but it was just typical pizza. The other 2 pizzas were somewhat unique, and this wasn't. It was good, but just didn't compare to the others.  Overall, it was expensive (basically $90 for everything, including delivery fee and tip). Not something we would order often, but the 3 \"not so wee\" sized pizzas were HUGE and we still have leftovers.  I am really happy that Nicole, the kitchen manager agreed to assist us. Unlike the Paradise location, she didn't turn us away and was happy to make things right.  It's things like that that will make me order again."}
{"text":"Saw this on TV, decided to try some off-the-strip eat joints.  Was difficult to find, did not know it was going to be co-located inside of a dive bar.  But the dive bar was pretty cool and laid back.  Got a huge huge pizza for $24 that 3 of us could not finish.  We took the leftovers with us and still munched on them on the strip the next day.  Cheap, good pizza."}
{"text":"This little local secret is hidden inside Moon Doggies. If you are getting pizza from them I recommend the smallest size.. more than enough for one, its great to share. They have a couple off the wall pizzas which are pretty dang tasty. I won't give out any directions to the place... you just have to hope you are lucky enough to stumble upon it!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan :) Ordered over the phone and picked up some grub today. I got a wee guinea pig pie, 10 piece mild wings, and a caesar salad($30). You go into Moondoggies and go past the bar and there's a little window to the left where you can pay and they bring out your food. Food was great! There was a ridiculous amount of croutons on the salad...103 to be exact (yea I counted em lol) I dunno if it was an accident or if that's normal here! I kinda wish it wasn't in a bar so I could bring the whole family but I guess take-out will have to do for now!"}
{"text":"Naked City is always a stop every time I am in Vegas!! I can't wait till I get to go back in  September.  But please bring back the Philly Cheese steak rolls!!!!"}
{"text":"Divey. That's all: divey.  The restaurant was closed when we arrived at 6:30 on a Sunday night but moon doggies next door is open til 3am and has a window to order. We opted to eat in and I have mixed feelings about the experience. For one: the pizza was really yum so credit where credit is due. But two: moon doggies is the epitome of a dive bar and I can't really get on board with a place that allows smoking within the establishment.  For pizza, I'd recommend the Guinea Pie, which was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. I believe we also got the Naked City Pizza, just for classic's sake. The pizzas themselves are okay. Vegas is full of delicious pizza and I can't in good conscience say that this was the best one I've had while in sin city. That being said, the pizza here is pretty solid so if you can handle the secondhand smoke and sticky floors, you're in for a real treat.  Note: also featured on triple D was the suicide fries which--for those that have a propensity for spicy foods--would probably be at the top of the \"to-try\" list while stopping in.  Parking is available in a small adjacent lot. The area is not the safest so if you're stopping in late late then make sure you bring a buddy! (Or two, or three.. there's a bar here you could actually just hang out for a while)."}
{"text":"Best pizza on earth.  I usually hit the one on Paradise on the way to the airport but Arville is inside one of the best dive bars on earth.   See the reviews of Moon doggies for more info.    This pizza is crazy good.  I live in Oakland California and we have good pizza but I always pine for Naked City.  The crust the cheese the farging sauce oh the sauce!   For some reason these cats make it to perfection and I can't get that anywhere else.    Get to naked city pizza and get a sheet of cheese and sit at the bar with a big glass of beer and eat that pizza pie before I do!   Life is short, eat that pizza!  They deliver via postmates which freaking rules, but you should still go there in person and smell it while you wait for it.  Have a beer.  Talk to people.  And when it's ready have a slice or two at the bar and make people jealous!"}
{"text":"Left on hold for fifteen minutes and then hung up on only to find out they didn't have a delivery driver available. Do not waste your time with this place"}
{"text":"Four stars because the food was fantastic! The service however was absolutely terrible! We were not given plates, napkins, or any utensils. My wife had an empty drink for 25 minutes before the server made it back to the table to check up. We had the suicide fries and she had nothing to wash it down or cool off her palette. Fries were great and the Guinea pie was the best pie I ever had in Vegas but next time we will get it to go!"}
{"text":"April 27, 2013 Saturday - dinner 6:30 PM 4 adults   Atmosphere - 4 stars Food - 5 stars Service - 5 stars  Background - We are here because of Food Networks Diners, Drive Up and Dives.  The bonus is that is a Buffalo NY pizza place!  I was born in Buffalo and visit my family out there, I wish I could visit more often.  Atmosphere - A bar with a kitchen.  As we walked up I noticed a sign indicating you must be over 21 to enter.  Very rare in Nevada, I do not think I have seen a sign like this since my last visit to North Dakota.  So a cozy dimly lit place filled with Buffalo Bills and Sabres stuff.  We sat at a curved booth and noticed right away that the table would rock badly if any weight was put on it.  Food   Drink - Normally I do not comment on it but since this all about Buffalo I will.  So I asked if they had Genny, for those who don't know that is Genesse out of Rochester NY.  They did not have it.  So she started listing off so common Canadian beers that you can get in Buffalo.  Then she said Loganberry, my wife said I lit up like a kid on Christmas day.  It is a hybrid berry that they make into a drink, I love it!    Appetizer - Wings of course, 20, two orders, a hot and medium.  I think we got all hot which was fine with me.  Good size, all had a good amount of meat on them.     My Main Course - Duh pizza!  We got a half tray.  Memories of eating pizza in Buffalo in my Aunt and Uncle's house flood me.  The tray reminds of grade school of lunch room pizza, this aint that pizza!  We ordered half pepperoni and half cheese.  The best thing about Buffalo pizza is that the pepperoni's, they are tiny compared to standard pepperoni.  When they cook they curl up to hold the grease.  These little pieces are heaven on a bed of cheese.  The pizza was loaded with cheese and was so gooey.     Dessert - Really I gorged myself on pizza!  Service - 0ne waitress worked about 8 tables, and she worked it!  Bonus is that she is from Buffalo!  Future - I can see future visits to this place on my visits to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza very juicy and savory taste, doesn't taste like regular pizza huts if you know what I mean. I've been coming here since I moved to Vegas 2 years ago. I gave it a 4 because the last time I was there the food wasn't all that great, I got 2 pizzas, garlic fries, wings, and garlic knots. Which was okay I didn't really enjoy it though."}
{"text":"Drove by this place several times on my way to work, finally decided to check it out for lunch.  Didn't realize before that the restaurant itself was IN the bar, but it really wasn't that bad.  It's a little dark, but the place isn't horrible to be in overall.    Ordered a \"Wee\" sized pepperoni pizza which was HUGE.  It fed me and my girlfriend and we still had two slices left over.  I caught a glimpse of the famous Suicide fries on the table next to us, so I decided to ask the waitress exactly how hot they were.  She said, on a scale of 1 -10....  she would rate them at a 10 1/2.  She offered me a sample of the suicide sauce that the fries are smothered in and I accepted.   Just a small taste of the sauce warmed my entire mouth and my throat.  The sauce tasted amazing and despite the heat, I still couldn't resist dipping some of my pizza crust in it throughout the meal.   Since my girlfriend doesn't appreciate spicy food like I do, we went with an order of the garlic fries.  You could tell they were homemade and they were AMAZING.  Hot salty fries with fresh garlic and covered in Parmesan Cheese and spices.  Took one star off because of the service.  The waitress was really nice, but she never asked us if we wanted a drink until our food was almost gone, and I couldn't get her attention at all throughout the meal. Seeing that my mouth was still on fire from the suicide sauce, I almost jumped the bar to get my own.  However, when she did come over she was really nice and was quick to help us when she did finally notice.   Also, place was really cheap.  We ordered the Wee sized pizza, two drinks and some garlic fries and the total was $20.  Being that I live so close, I will definitely be coming back here to watch some football games, enjoy a beer and get some amazing food."}
{"text":"My buddy recommended this place so we went down here. First off, I'm not a big pizza guy. Yes I know, that's weird. Everyone loves pizza. Me, not so much. Its crust, its sauce, its meat, its cheese.   Rolled in here Valentine's night at 6pm. There was maybe 6 people there in this dive bar called Moondoggies. Not a bad place. There's a little window toward the back of the bar that houses the pizza kitchen. We sat at the bar, ordered some beers, and the bartender took our pizza order.  I ordered the bacon and egg pizza, my friend the marghertia pizza. The wee one is $13 and contains 6 squares (not slices) but its plenty filling as I could only eat two before being full. I found the flavor delicious, the crust was thick but cooked right. It was a pretty good pizza.  The bartender was excellent, very entertaining, and kept up with the crowd as the place filled up to capacity within a half hour. It took about 40 minutes for our pizza to get done which is a little long, but they were doing lots of take out orders as well as servicing the customers in the bar.   I will definitely come back and eat here again."}
{"text":"I walked inside of naked city pizza and went to the order window.  As I got there, a guy walked past and asked if we had our IDs. He then walked in the back and started preparing food without washing his hands.  I then saw him drop an avacado, pick it up and start cutting it without washing it off first.  I immediately walked out after.  Can't believe the lack of cleanliness I just witnessed."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you want to wait for over an hour for a small pizza. We asked our waitress if they had forgotten about us -- we got no answer -- 25 mins later our pizza comes without any sort of apology. Not even a smile or a thank you. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Stopped here one night just to try the suicide fries and they definitely live up to their name -- Really, really spicy! The ranch dipping sauce they come with is necessary to cool down the hotness. They were good, but I didn't love them. The pizza looked really good so I'd go back to try that."}
{"text":"We wanted to hear this after seeing it on DDD Foodnetwork. We got a large pizza, stuffed mushrooms and suicide fries. The pizza was ok. Lots of dough and not a ton of flavor, but not bad. Disappointed with the muschrooms. They were very small and not stffed with much and you don't get that many either. I did not try the suicide fries because they're too hot for me, but my boyfriend liked them. I don't think we would come back here again. There are way to many great restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place has a bar immediately next to the pizza joint. I wasn't able to see the bar so I'm only reviewing my sit down food experience.   Pizza- 3 stars. I had their pizza that was featured on food network. I can't remember what it was called but it was average for me. I wasn't too fond of their crust, and I'm a huge crust person and picky.   Pizza logs-4 stars. The pepperoni and cheese inside the egg roll, combined with their delicious marinara sauce was absolutely amazing.   Loaded potato fries- 5 stars. I got a \"small\" and this thing was huge. He fires were sooooooo crispy on the outside and perfect in my book on how crunchy yet soft they were. Even with all the toppings, it managed to not get the fries soggy. Yesssssssss, sooooo awesome.    I'll definitely be back for the pizza logs and fries without a question. Dare I say hose fries are one of the best I've had in my life. The service is slow, and the wait was about 15 minutes before we got all our food. It's a good place to just do a takeout, or probably order food from the bar side."}
{"text":"Phenomenal pizza at this off-strip local dive bar. The saus-eeege on our pizza mirrored that of a gyro meatball, and...was...goooooood. LET IT RIDE! at the bar-side video poker machines, drink for free, and be sure to order some 'za before your Uber ride back to the strip. Naked City is a great local tap to wind down, fuel up (or soak up), and enjoy the subtleties of the quiet side opposite the bright lights and arduous Strip plights."}
{"text":"MMMMM YUMMY. This is for sure one of my favorite pizza spots to enjoy a delicious and hearty pizza! I love the Guinea pie which is my favorite and I crave it a lot. They have yummy roasted garlic buns that are stuffed with garlic which are Amazing. The pepperoni and pineapple is really good as well. I always enjoy the food and atmosphere and I love tasty pizza and a blue moon with oranges. This is a great place to eat which is always in my dining out rotation!"}
{"text":"Tried the wings and was pretty well disappointed. Sauce was forgettable and the homemade blue cheese sucked. Watery and totally lacking in flavor. Salad and celery sticks were dreadful and wilted."}
{"text":"Taste: 3.5 Creativity/Authenticity: 3 Atmosphere: 2.5 Service: 3 Bang for your buck: 2.5  The GF was craving pizza and our buddies who live down the street recommended this place... thank you guys cause this pizza was delicious. Started with the pizza log good but very greasy literally the grease leaked through 2 paper plates onto the table; next we order 2 pizza dunno why got the guinie and pineapple pizza both were great very bold flavors on the guinie i liked the meatball paired with the very flavorful cheese. Best thing about this place probably the cheap drinks IM from LA so 2 beers is about $14, here $5 so im a happy camper. Overall like this place for the food the atmosphere is kinda weird tucked away in dive bar but still worth going Ill be back"}
{"text":"I had what I saw on DDD., LOL!!!   The suicide wings and Guinea pie.  Both did not disappoint.   There is also a full bar next door so one can choose the appropriate adult beverage to go with their meal.  The only thing is that it is not in the best neighborhood.  While I was there a \"customer\" kept trying to sell myself and other customers razors out of a plastic bag.  The nice young lady finally said something to him, but at this point many of us had already felt uncomfortable enough to cut our meals short."}
{"text":"Naked City opened up a few weeks ago and I've wanted to try it when a friend showed me their website.  I'm very glad I did.  First off, the place is tiny.  There are a few stools and a bar to eat at so you should consider take out if you're with a larger group or if it's during the rush.  I tried the Naked Royal which is a warm sandwich with Italian sausage, hot capicola, and fresh mozzarella cheese.  It was fantastic.  Great balance of flavor between the sausage and capicola.  It's served with your choice of homemade pickle, various pasta or potato salads, and homemade pickled vegetables.  These guys make everything fresh on site except the bread.  Sides, pickles, and even freshly roasted deli meats.  As such, the choice of sandwiches is small but that's good because they can focus on quality.  I highly recommend trying this place.  It's the sort of owner operated joint focusing on freshness that Vegas needs."}
{"text":"For delivery I ordered the naked city pizza and philly cheese steak rolls.  Soooooooooo good!!  The dough was fresh and there wasn't an abundance of tomatoe sauce.  The cheese steak rolls were ridiculously delicious.   Can't wait to try their other pizzas and treats!!   This place is a must eat!"}
{"text":"Good food. Will definitely eat here again.  My only complaints: Suuuuuuper flimsy paper plates and soda by the can - no refills :("}
{"text":"great food inside moon doggie's sports bar(?) and video poker. yeah not a fancy part of town, yeah not a fancy place (really is a dive), Buffalo Bills and Sabers decor all over (should be a 5 star just for that!) BUT the food is terrific. The guinea pizza is yummy with the fresh, chewy mozarella and the crust to crunch on! When they say hot chicken wings, believe them and order milk! But still tasty while dripping from the heat! Not daring enough to try the suicide fries but the garlic fries had the same texture that made in n out famous. By the way, the portions are outrageously huge!!!! the 'Wee' size (smallest) could easily feed a family of four. Then save room for the canoli for a dessert lovers dream. Not too sweet, just delicious!"}
{"text":"It was alright. I just didn't taste the amazingness in the wings. They arrived in a Togo box, more than 25 minutes after they were ordered and they were soggy. I was willing to give these baked/fried wings a chance but they just didn't do it for me, and I tried 3 different types of wings, Sicilian, medium and BBQ. Sicilian was by far the best. I did however order a steak and cheese that was fire! Steak was seasoned perfect and it had the right amount of spice. The pizza was good because the cheese was perfectly cooked on the top but the crust wasn't all that. It was an experience all together but somewhat inconvenient for dine-in and the trip to the bar next door for drinks was just odd. Luckily, they have a friendly service crew to keep the hungry patrons happy while they wait."}
{"text":"Holy pizza! This place really amazed me. Wasnt in the mood to go out and get some mediorce pizza but what the hell, I did it anyways. Showed up around 1 am ordered pizza thru this little  hole in the wall. Literally. Gave it personality.  Got a beer while I was waiting with Aaron I believe. Chill guy.  Got home and had the pizza.  This thing was f@$@$ awesome. Will go back and bring friends to drink and family to eat."}
{"text":"This spot is always first on my list for a delicious pie when I come into Vegas.  Food is fresh and hot and the flavors hit every note.  I've been at least 8 times in the last couple years and it has always been amazing.  I suggest the guinea pie or the 51*."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas. Very cool little dive bar that we would have never known about if it weren't for Triple D!   Service is excellent. Food is excellent and the beers are cold and the Raider game was on every tv. My kinda place!"}
{"text":"Great service from Bartender. Had the Royal sandwich, which was delish on first few bites, but then it became kind of one-note. Just taste the salty sausage and not much else. They need to add pickled veggies or something to counterbalance the saltiness of the sausage. Overall, cant complain too much since it was a great value at $10. Don't go here for the Ambiance though."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I did see this place on DDD. My girl and I make it a point to try at least one place recommended in a City by Guy. It's killing me that people are slamming this place for being a Dive, when they were warned, told, cautioned or whatever Word you want to use, that its a Dive. Sorry, I hate bad reviews for an Owner trying to make it and somebody slams his dream and future success for nothing. Rant over. That night we had a Wee size Steak and Cheese Pizza, Ceaser salad (small) and Sicilian flavored wings. The Pizza was very good to judge it by Pizza Hut standards is just not fair. This Pizza from dough to oven looks hand made and the taste is the same. The cheese could have more generous but the flavor for what we had was amazing just as it was. The salad was good. Not your typical Ceasar but very good. Now lets talk about the wings, THE SICILIAN WINGS WERE ARGUABLY THE BEST FLAVOR COMBINATION I HAVE EVER TASTED. we had an order of 8 and as stuffed as we were I wish we had ordered more. Do yourself a favor and try them. Ambiance was as a Bar should be. Minus the Bills decor ( Saints fan here) lol. We can't wait to go back and this time we'll skip the salad to make room for more Wings. Or maybe just order more wings. Lol. Great place. Service was just as you would get in a Bar and very knowledgable about the Menu. Try this place. If you have kids order ahead and take it back to your Hotel, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch on Saturday. Both the Moon Doggies bartender and waitress for the NCP seating area were friendly. The two of us ordered the stuffed mushrooms, he ordered the beef on weck, and I tried a slice of the pepperoni (I like to order a piece of just cheese or pepperoni to test how tasty a place's most basic pizzas are without adding other flavors into the mix yet).  For the stuffed mushrooms, $9 seemed kind of steep for 6 small ones. They were decently tasty, & accompanied by a creamy sauce & strips of mild peppers, but I wouldn't pay $9 for them again.  The beef on weck resembled what it was supposed to be, though the meat was thinner & more overcooked than you'd usually see, it didn't come with any horseradish or a pickle, and the bun didn't seem to have been dipped in au jus (all normal hallmarks of this type of sandwich). Overall, it was a fairly boring version of beef on weck that neither of us would likely get again.  The pepperoni pizza had two kinds of cheeses -- a bottom layer of sliced cheese that tasted like provolone, and shredded mozzarella sprinkled on top, only partially melted. It felt and tasted overall like an undercooked frozen pizza. I wouldn't order it again, either. Though it was a good size (TWSS), and it wasn't the worst $2.50 slice of pizza I've ever had (the dough/crust is pretty nice; soft on the inside, with a crustier outside), it was no higher than a 3-4 out of 10.  For now, I'll award a 3 and hope that when I'm able to return and try a specialty pizza, it'll warrant keeping that score."}
{"text":"This place is small, only a few tables and it's in a dive bar where people are allowed to smoke.  I've only been during the week for work lunches so no beers with my pizza:(the poutine was really rich and filling.  The largest size pizza on the menu is baked in a restaurant baking sheet - if you've worked in a restaurant you understand. It's a HUGE - way more than 4 people could eat. Guineas pie and chicken wing dip were awesome!"}
{"text":"My friend ordered two pizzas from here for her party and seriously hands down this was one of the best pizzas I've ever had! My favorite was the Guinea Pig pizza. It was like God created a pizza and gave the recipe to the owner. Too bad I don't have a photo because it looks Tate's as delicious as it looks!!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is excellent. Only came here because saw it was on the DDD show on food network, and can say am very happy! While normally would subtract star for the typical bar feel, the pizza more than made up for that.   Had one with sausage, pepperoni, garlic crust, And couple other things. Was really awesome! Even the \"small\" size could only eat half of it, but took it back and ate rest for dinner.   Will come back again!! Unless find better pizza place in the area, but unlikely"}
{"text":"Groupon alert!  As a Groupon addict, I'm always excited when they offer one for a place I've been dying to try.   We decided to order a pizza for takeout, since we were feeling pretty lazy after an exhausting weekend of doing nothing. I decided on a Not so Wee Royal and a Wee garlic fries. I was tempted by the Poutine, but I'm just not a big fan of gravy and cheese. I ordered the pizza on the well-done side based on some previous reviews about the pizza being under or unevenly cooked.   When I got the pizza home, I was excited to take a bite. I didn't find any of the crust or dough issues that previous reviewers had mentioned luckily, so I was happy about that. I adored the texture. It was chewy and I really enjoyed the sauce. The added touch of ricotto was delightful and added a sweet flavor to accompany the savory. I was very happy with this pizza. My fella, on the other hand, wasn't as impressed. He stuck mainly with the garlic fries, which were much more garlicky than I would like. If only they used real garlic instead of garlic salt and I would've been sold!  All in all, I was very happy with my meal here. I have a feeling I won't be eating here too often, unless I go with a friend. Hehe.  I look forward to trying more menu items here sometime soon."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Las Vegas. The crust has so much flavor, nice thick cut pepperoni. Wings are fantastic, The fries are great. To me Joes NY is good not great and overpriced about $5 a slice. Metro pizza looks much better then it tastes soggy crust. Tasted better when reheated in toaster oven. Pizza Rock Good but again $5 a slice hit or miss but its good. Naked city not a thin crust ny pie. Go try it its a dive thats part of the appeal of naked city. I grew up in NY but I dont think NY pizza from NY is that good anymore.  Try it you will be hooked and its cheap compared to other pizza in LV"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza in Las Vegas! I've never been disappointed here and the bar the pizza kitchen works out of doesn't disappoint either. This is my favorite location since you can enjoy a few drinks with great pizza. I'm a traditionalist so my go to is just a pepperoni pizza, but all of their speciality pizzas are awesome. Their appetizers are incredible, too! I haven't been able to try all of them, but I generally don't leave without the garlic buns. Trust me, they're like nothing you've had before because they're so much better."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to eat in vegas... Even despite it being in a dive bar.  The poutine fries are so delicious.  And the stinger pizza is my favorite!  Who thought to put boneless wings,  steak, hot and sweet peppers on a pizza with a white sauce?  That white sauce is incredible!!!  Whoever invented this pizza is a genius!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Overall - Highly recommended One of the best pizza places I have had so far and they are open late night apparently and located inside a bar! Definitely a great hangout place.  Parking Pretty spacious could be limited during busy hours but it is inside a bar so might be best to rideshare over.  Service Food is brought out to your table and there is self-service water, utensils and napkins by the door. The bar itself seemed fine people just hanging out and having a good time.  Food Suicide Fries - Not a fan of this. The spicy level is pretty high and I would eat it if it was more flavorful since I enjoy tasty spicy food not spicy just because. The fries themselves were okay. I would definitely pass on this unless you just feel like something spicy. *2 stars*  Guinea Pie - I was pleasantly surprised by the tastiness of the pizza. I was very skeptical when it came out in a square form. The crust reminded me of a thinner version of the now trendy pretzel bun. I think the garlic sauce is what really made this pizza stand out as the best pizza I have eaten thus far. *5 stars*"}
