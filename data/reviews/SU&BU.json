{"text":"I really wanted to like this place cause the reviews and pictures seemed pretty good but it was kind of disappointing.  I ordered half a Salmon Samba under the recommendation of the girl at cash that a full burrito is far too filling. I requested to switch the sauce to a spicier one which wasn't a problem.  Upon opening the burrito, it was very saucy and spilling out on both sides which made it rather hard to eat, even in the paper wrapper, and much smaller/not as densely filled as the photos I see in the reviews. There were maybe 3-4 little chunks of salmon scattered throughout, 1 little chunk of avocado, a sprinkling of masago and the rest was just sauce, carrots and red cabbage (which are ingredients not mentioned in the description). No hint of a seaweed salad anywhere. The sauce was a tad on the sweet side, but pretty tasty otherwise. I do wish they used less because it seriously overpowered anything else in the burrito so I couldn't really tell if the salmon was fresh or not. I only got halfway through the burrito when the paper gave out and leaked sauce all down my hands and desk. Unfortunately it only got soggier as I neared the end of the half burrito... Let's just say I was real relieved to be done the soggy mess.  Maybe they do better poke? I'll probably try it out again once they have their grand opening... hopefully it gives them some time to work out all the kinks."}
{"text":"Service here is awesome! The food is fresh and tasty.   Would try a burrito next time. The burger is hard to eat as it falls apart so easily."}
{"text":"Awesome place for a light and healthy lunch! I got the salmon samba, there's not a lot of salmon but overall it's very tasty. There's not much flavour in the salmon. Workers are very friendly and they al work well as a team. During lunch there's a pretty good line up so I would recommend going before or after lunch hours."}
{"text":"This place has some potential: great location, bright interior and a modern food concept. We dropped in after a screening at TIFF Bell Lightbox, excited that there was a new eatery in the area. Ordered two sensei and one salmon samba burrito plus a fish Poké bowl. The Poké bowl was overwhelmed with sweet sauce, and I could taste nothing else. The others complained of their overly-sauced burritos as well. A shame considering the presentation was great and the ingredients looked colourful and fresh!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Vancouver and pleasantly surprised to discover sushi burritos! Loved the tuna tango, the fact that there are half sizes (given how delicious mine was I should have gotten a full) and didn't mind the bar seating as they are all by the window. Lots of natural light and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Having tried ALL the poke and sushi burrito places in Toronto, I'd say this place is pretty good. Their main offerings are the poke bowl, sushi burrito, and the new sushi burger. I've tried all of these over the course of 5-6 visits here.   The poke bowl is very small, compared to other poke places in Toronto. For $12+ tax, I'd expect something decently filling. Sadly, I was only 50% full after the poke bowl. Not an issue I ever run into as a 5'2 female, as it doesn't take many calories to fill me up! My other complaint is that they put everything in a tiny bowl, all piled up, which presents beautifully. But when you try to mix it or eat anything that's not on the immediate top of the pile, disaster happens.So you have to eat much of the fish/ingredients on top before you can get to the rice underneath. On the plus side, the ingredients are fresh, the sauce is delicious, and the presentation is beautiful.   The Poke Guys, my go-to poke joint in Toronto, have a large poke bowl for $13 + tax that's twice the size (ie twice the amount of fish, other ingredients, and rice) and equally yummy. I can never finish it in one sitting.  The sushi burrito, also $12 + tax, is sufficiently portioned that I considered it pretty filling. Again, very yummy. No complaints here. 5/5 for the sushi burrito.  The sushi burger looks interesting, but does not taste anything spectacular. The burger buns are basically fried rice, and taste somewhat bland, with sushi, avocado, etc as the \"burger\". Tried it once, ok to try again once in a while just to mix things up.  Finally, I asked for water once, just wanted a sip or two, not a whole can of beverage. The answer: Nope. Gotta buy it.  Otherwise service is consistently great, speedy enough. The place is clean, bright, and airy. Not many seats, maybe 8 in total in the entire place (not counting the other side they share with a bubble tea place), but I always go during off-peak hours, so not an issue for me."}
{"text":"Just tried their sushi burger! It definitely lived up to all the hype. The rice \"buns\" were the perfect accompaniment to all the fresh ingredients inside. The fish was incredible, and the dressing just pulled everything together. Would definitely recommend to anyone willing to try something new."}
{"text":"Really loved the relaxed atmosphere of this place :) I ordered the hyped sushi burger and it was absolutely AMAZING! It was fresh and the rice patties were crispy and everything was paired perfectly. Just writing this review is making me want to get another one! Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and nutritious. Enough choices on the menu to satisfy me. I'd come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, had the fish and chips and the tuna poke bowl was absolutely amazing! Can't wait to go back for more!!!"}
{"text":"We went there for sushi burger but they ran out and it was around 3 pm which was disappointing because if they know their burger is popular they need to provide more.We ordered two fish pokes. They were fresh and healthy but we think their pokes are over priced because they put less fish and more vegetables. Their service was great and staff were friendly. Last thing I wish they make sushi burrito with purple rice for those who likes purple rice more than white including me."}
{"text":"Came here twice during Toronto Poke week. Really DELICIOUS fresh, lite,HEALTHY ingredients that FLOW & blend together really well!    Amazingly AWESOME & super Friendly staff that puts a lot of Heart, ART and Love in making their Poke bowls.    Truly deserving as WINNER of Toronto Poke Week (Nov.3-17, 2016)"}
{"text":"I got to check off one of the things on my \"Must Try\" list while visiting TO, which was a sushi burrito - yayyyyy!   Although I should have gone fully authentic and gotten one within a nori wrap and rice, I wanted a light pre-dinner (aka 1st dinner for myself) snack so I went with their summer salmon roll which was salmon and veggies wrapped in rice paper. So essentially a giant salad roll.  Everything in it was super fresh, the fish, veggies, mango and masago. I wasn't expecting the ginger and it was a sinus clearer for sure lol  My only suggestion is to wrap the ingredients a bit tighter in the rice paper. That way, everything isn't falling out and you don't look like a hot mess eating it."}
{"text":"Back for the 3rd time and I'm happy to give 5 stars again.  If I can give 6 or 7 stars, I would!    Went back here last night with my friend, who I had gone with the first time.  I guess you can say this is one of \"our spots\" now.  We specifically went back for the Sushi Burger and of course our fave, Poké Chips (formerly known as Fish & Chips).  Sushi Burger - Out of this world! With all the trends coming out, a sushi burger was inevitable.  I'm very happy though that we had it here first, but that also just means that our standards are now very very high.  This thing was amazing.  Loved the fact that they used the purple rice as their \"buns\".  It was the perfect thickness and crunchiness. Although it was fried, it wasn't at all greasy.  The burger was filled with big chunks of tuna and salmon sashimi, avocado, some greens, shredded veggies (coleslaw, from what it looked) and seaweed.  I personally thought that the seaweed complimented the overall burger with its rich flavor.  Otherwise, the burger would've been just been \"pretty good\".  5/5  Poké Chips - If you had read my last review, I was a little disappointed with this dish.  What I had assumed as an \"off day\" was right because this serving was what I had originally fallen in love with.  Yes, I'm that passionate about this lol. We noticed that they also added some shredded cheese on top of the already melted nacho cheese, as well as some finely chopped green peppers that I don't remember them having before.  Even with the very little changes, I was very pleased with it.  I was actually quite full last night from the burger and chips that I didn't finish my chips....until this morning for breakfast. 5/5  Will definitely keep coming back here and will likely be with some new customers."}
{"text":"Been here twice and have not been disappointed! Both times I enjoyed the poke bowl and it was sooo fresh and delicious. A bunch of tuna and salmon accompanied by ginger, mango, dragon fruit, seaweed salad, taro chips, cucumber, fish roe on top of purple rice! The rice is glazed with a sweet soy sauce. All the ingredients alone are delicious on its own but when you mix it all together... I mean every bite is different. I am really pleased with the presentation (very Instagram-worthy) and it feels healthy. I don't feel disgusting after eating their poke bowl.   Do give it a try. I am not a huge fan of their burrito since it's hard and messy to eat. the sashimi pieces are too big and when you take a bite, everything just falls apart.   Anywho, give them a try. really good food and friendly staff.   Happy Belly!"}
{"text":"Decent poke bowls but the restaurant has some things to work on. It's pretty expensive for what it is  - everything is pretty overpriced by at least a few dollars a dish. Most importantly, staff are consistently pretty unfriendly. Restaurant is under staffed and staff act irritated when you're there."}
{"text":"Love the poke nachos here. Very fresh, flavours meld together well and really need to come back here to try other meals, but every time I go I fall back on the nachos because they are that good!"}
{"text":"Tried the poke bowl and Su&Bu chips.  The Poke bowl is generous on fish and toppings. The bowl itself is not big and is perfect for one person. Other places have bowls with much more rice. Can ask for sauce on the side as it's a bit too much. Lots of veggies, mango chunks, dragonfruit, seaweed salad, sushi ginger. The sauce is flavourful with ginger and not too salty.  Poke chips were made of taro even though the description said had lotus chips. Didn't get any with my order.  Had bar sitting along the windows and 2 small tables. Good place to grab a bite with presotea in the same store and Sweet Jesus just next door!  You can order online on their website or app."}
{"text":"I would say it is an okay place for poke bowl. A little price for the portion and quality. It is a chain so I won't expect much but it is definitely alright for being an easy lunch place. It is pretty healthy though (if you ask for less mayonnaise). Still waiting for my perfect poke bowl /sushi burrito place!"}
{"text":"I underestimated this place.....  Ordered a Sarumachu sushito.... and i gotta say it's pretty damn good! Got the smaller size and it was smaller than I expected... but it's decent for a light lunch. Was craving for more after I finished it! Love the joint too, airy, lotsa window, looks out to nice plaza. Would def come back to try more"}
{"text":"I ordered from UberEATS and wanted to give this place a try. The poke nachos are SO. GOOD. Very reasonably priced for a large rectangular box (comes in one size only) filled to the top with wonton chips, salmon, avocado, masago and yes, cheese sauce (which surprisingly totally worked!!) - as well as some other sauces I can't remember but they were really good. The cheese sauce isn't anything like a nacho cheese sauce from the movie theatre. It wasn't overly cheesy, it actually had a hint of sweet and didn't mask the fish or make the dish taste weird. They definitely make it in-house as I've never tasted anything like it. 100% recommend this.  As far as cons, there are none so far as this was all I ordered from them at the time."}
{"text":"One of the best poke places I've tried in Toronto. The fish poke ($12) was really fresh and the fresh fruit complimented it well. The prices are standard for poke but the rice to topping ratio is maybe 1:3 (poke bowls should be about the fish, not rice). However I do have to say that it's not filling enough for the price - one size only - as there is a spring mix salad and rice at the bottom. Would have liked more rice for that price. Comparable to North Poke in Kensington Market but not just quite."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service.The people who work here seem dedicated to providing fast , polite service. The store is attractive and clean. This is a spot I will revisit for sure."}
{"text":"Sushi burritos and poke bowls are all the craze now in Toronto. This place is definitely catering towards this demand. The ingredients are fresh and the sushi burritos are well prepared.  For me, I need to finish a whole burrito to be full.  The prices are similar to other sushi burrito and poke bowl restaurants."}
{"text":"Had the sushi burger here. A unique spin on the poke bowl/burrito craze. That crunchy rice \"bread\" makes the dish. Will definitely need to come back *drools*"}
{"text":"Stopped by Su&Bu for lunch.  Had the Salmon poke.    Amazing!!!   Not much else to say. Likely the best I have had to date.   Go there now!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to see what all the hype was for Poke Bowls and Sushi Burritos. Decided to give it a try for lunch today with a friend. When we got there, the line was super long and almost outside the door. We did go during lunch rush, and I feel like a day like today, more people were out and about cause of St. Patrick's Day. To skip the line, I decided to order through the Ritual App because there was a one time Ritual special to get Fish Poke for $7.99 instead of 11.99, and the Salmon Samba Burrito. Placed my order at 12:17pm, said my order was ready for pick up at 12:33pm, but didn't get my order until 12:44pm. One of the coworkers was very apologetic and explained that they didn't expect such a high volume lunch rush, but was very accommodating to the customers. My friend and I shared the sushi burrito and Poke Bowl, and both agreed that the Sushi Burrito was the better choice. I'd def go back again!"}
{"text":"The gringo sushi burrito with chili soy wrap instead of the seaweed was amazing, I could have eaten two. Also tried the fish and chips that was tasty too. Staff was friendly, going back soon for sure.  Cravings that tempura wrap  !!"}
{"text":"Around a 4.2   Normally not a fan of poke bowls where the fish isn't marinated but this was really good. Came here for lunch on a Friday and since I missed the lunch rush, I was the only person there and I got my bowl super fast. I got the samuraichi in bowl form. For some reason I was completely dazed when I came here and accidently ordered my bowl with salad instead of rice, like what the heck, I need my rice. I thought I wouldn't like it as much but every component of the bowl, especially the tuna and salmon were super fresh. I really liked the sweet chilli sauce that was in it as well. Overall I really enjoyed the bowl, but the 14 plus dollars I paid for it was a tad questionable. But maybe I would have been more full of I had correctly ordered my rice. Still, service was super friendly and I can see myself coming back for their fresh tasting ingredients."}
{"text":"Sushi burritos and poke bowls are so popular in Toronto now. With so many food trucks and stores popping up, it is hard to decide which one to choose. Sadly, SU&BU is just ok in terms of this poke bowls food race.  It is located inside the courtyard by Sweet Jesus on John Street. I ordered the signature bowl and it came out to be around $15. Pretty expensive for a poke bowl. The bowl size is pretty small and the portion is not that much. Overall, I was pretty disappointed at the quality and size of the bowl for what I am paying for. The sashimi bites were just alright and the ingredients did not blend well together in my opinion. I thought the bowl was quite dry in terms of lack of sauce. In addition, it took a while to order because the staffs were busy fulfilling ritual orders. There is not much seating as well as they only offer bar stool seating.  Overall, would I be back? Just a maybe but I am definitely not ordering a poke bowl from them again."}
{"text":"I think it's mediocre, nothing special, have definitely had better sushi burritos. Our friends ordered a few types of burritos and pokebowls and we all agreed we've definitely had better, whether they were from food trucks, night it up night market or Toronto stores such as pokeguys... this is probably the last one we will go back to for some pokebowl fix. I didn't feel like there were any creativity in the creation and my friend's tuna felt mushy to taste (kind of like it was frozen for a long time)"}
{"text":"I got a sushi burrito. Not bad. Very friendly staff to help to decide. The place looks pretty clean from what I remember."}
{"text":"I ordered the poke bowl through ritual (Ritual offers exclusive perks at this location, one per ritual member). I like the ingredients they used in the Poke bowl and they are pretty generous comparing to other poke bowl places I've tried. One thing I think they should improve though, is to put more rice in the bowl. I agree with one of the previous reviews that the rice to toppings ratio is like 1:3. I normally don't like eating rice but the toppings are too savory to eat without the rice. Otherwise it would've been perfect.  I will try the sushi burger or sushi burrito next time."}
{"text":"Really fresh! Not many places to sit and utensils kept behind counter made it a bit inconvenient but loved the food !"}
{"text":"Cute shop. The sushi burger was beyond my expectations. Delicious huge chunks of sushi inside, a little bit of bite with the spicy sauce the bun was UNREAL! I will definitely go back!!! Nice work"}
{"text":"What a fun spot! And the food!! My God that sushi burger....mmm  I am so glad I discovered Su & Bu on instagram (thanks to local Elites @Anthony) it was love at first sight with the sushi burger. The colours and concept was so foreign - it made me curious! I mean sushi +burrito= genius! sushi never fills me up, a sushi burrito wrapped in  noori that pretty much resembles a handroll is a perfect portion to kill a craving on the go.  On the same day as landing in the 6ix, I headed here for dinner. The venue is a cute compact fast food joint that resembles the design of many Montreal resto like Red Tiger or les street monkeys. The space is shared with another small bubble tea business.   Rating in 5* I ordered the sushi burger-10$ *****(very flavourful, spicy kick- picture two sushi pizzas making the bun of the burger and the inside containing salmon, crab meat, seaweed salad filling with spicy mayo - divine! Good for one person) ; taro chips -3$ ***(tad oily, served in a large bag tasted like plantain chips) ; Poké nachos-11$*(DO NOT RECOMMEND - unless you order without cheese whiz, yes the yellow stuff in a jar-it's too overpowering);Sensai burrito -1/2 portion -9$**(too small for one person ; bland, needed more salt and seasoning.)  Food was made relatively quickly. However, customer service was a little off-the employees looked really unhappy - Sweet Jesus!(Play on words? :D- popular dessert spot next door) despite the quality of service-I'll be back for the food !"}
{"text":"This location was quite disappointing. I ordered the full sized Salmon Samba sushi burrito and I found it rather small for its price. Although it had a lot of flavours and the salmon cubes were decently sized, the seaweed was extremely chewy and the rice was mushy."}
{"text":"Went here since I saw this place all over instagram and sushi burritos were starting to become a trend. I got the sensei sushi burrito that had tuna, tempura shrimp, crab, carrots, cucumber and a house sauce. The burrito wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good. It got soo messy and soggy after 2 bites and most areas of the burrito was very bland and flavorless. I wanted to like it but I prefer AYCE sushi better.   Overall, I did have high hopes but it wasn't my thing. There wasn't enough flavor and saltiness in it, it got soggy immediately and was too messy too eat as the wrapper started falling apart and ripping from the watery bits. If you're feeling sushi, I'd say you're better off paying a bit more for AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Solid Poke place in Toronto. Came here on a Friday afternoon and there was no one here, much to my excitement. I ordered the OG and it was quickly made and tasted good. Nothing over the top or overly exciting, but a good Poke Bowl.   I'm taking 3 stars off (probably should be 4 stars off) for the lack of hygiene. While my bowl was being made, I saw another staff member eating their own food right in the food line without any gloves on. THEN he goes and starts making someone else's order without washing his hands or anything and just starts touching other food. Not sure I can give this place another shot after seeing that."}
{"text":"Not good... not worth it!!! Rollation up on Dundas is FAR BETTER. Terrible service / planning. Placed an order at 12:31pm and it was ready at 1:06pm!! ... Several unhappy other customers are walking out - all angry -  left and right. All with incorrect or delayed orders etc. Everyone - there are SEVERAL better priced sushi places in the area with much better value. take 2 min and find one on google and AVOID this place :) boo."}
{"text":"I've tried 2 dishes...not a fan. Maybe its a personal preference. I like poke bowls with lots of texture and umami flavour. I prefer the poke bowls at pussateris with raw fish, taro chips, seaweed salad, some creamy dressing and sushi rice."}
{"text":"I think this place is pretty cool! I've had the tuna burrito, the gringo and the nachos. My eye is on the sushi burger next - looks fantastic! This resto is strategically located next to the famed Sweet Jesus. In fact, it was Sweet Jesus that was in my sights when I had my lunch at SU&BU last Sunday, but as I approached the building I thought I'd pick up a burrito too. I liked the tuna a lot - it tastes very, very fresh and I prefer it to the gringo one (which has mango - not a huge fan of mango in sushi but just a matter of preference, it wasn't bad overall). The nachos are really intriguing - the cheese drizzled atop the chips and salmon is definitely of the processed variety (think cheez whiz), but it's a kind of weird mix of fish and cheese that somehow worked for me. I dig it. Think it would be great if they offered spicy selections (eg put jalapeño in rolls or chilli pepper or a spicier mayo sauce), but otherwise think this place is more than decent. Barstool seating so more of a grab and go, but worth giving a try."}
{"text":"The fish poke here is epic! I wish they made a larger size because I was definitely craving more when I scraped down the final pieces off the rim of my bowl for lunch today. The flavour combinations here are thoughtfully pieced together with quality ingredients (i.e. dragonfruit and fresh mango) and generous portions of fish (tuna and salmon). They also use a combination of white and purple rice, which really packs a punch. Needless to say, it was bite after bite of deliciousness!  I would've totally given this place 5/5 if it weren't for the price ($12+tx for the poke bowl), but it is definitely worth trying at least once!"}
{"text":"this place is amazing, came back for the 2nd time. Got the samurachi and sensai. Both are yummy My first time having sushi  burrito and I love it!"}
{"text":"I had an issue the first time I came in but I gave the owner a chance to fix it and they came through. Props!"}
{"text":"Extremely, extremely mediocre. I ordered the OG poke, which seemed like a safe choice with both tuna and salmon. The whole thing was prepared and presented at a less than satisfactory level. Having been warned by people who have frequented this location before, I made sure to order with the sauce on the side as they tend to over sauce the poke bowls. I just wasn't pleased by any of the sides; the seaweed salad had poor texture, the mangoes seemed to have been sitting for a while, the avocado was brown, and the rice was mushy and clumpy. As for servings, I got way more ginger than needed, and honestly not enough sashimi fish? Overall, pretty disatisfactory. Really wouldn't go again, but if you're super desperate for a poke powl fix in Mississauga, I guess this will barely suffice."}
{"text":"Last night was our 10th visit since this location opened and I am sadly disappointed! The food quality and serving size started out great but we have noticed a steady decline. Ordered 3 OG bowls plus the taro chips for take out. The taro chips were burnt and inedible. Second time this has happened (I'm a forgiving person and I let the first time slide). All 3 OG bowls had hard green mangoes, again inedible. Our bowls were hardly full with a minimal amount of salmon & tuna(compared to our previous orders). Edamame was crunchy. We really want this place to be successful as it is walking distance from our house and the concept is awesome but the quality & value needs bug improvement. On a good note, service has consistently been friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I got a poke bowl (forgot the name, but it had mango and kale in it) and wasn't too satisfied by the end of it. There was so much kale I felt like I was eating a salad. My friend got the sushi burger thing which looked good. I probably won't be back considering how expensive it was for something that won't satisfy me."}
{"text":"Poke nachos was amazing. The first time ever having this and the blend of flavors and textures wow'ed me. This was a huge portion given the price. I will definitely look into trying more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"It has really great food. I ordered a Salmom Samba, which consists of a variety of ingredients that taste delicious all together. Although the burrito started falling apart near the end, it was packed with food in the perfect ratio. There wasnt too much rice, just enough salmon and other ingredients. I would definitely come here again and try one of their poke bowls, the food is so beautiful."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such great reviews.  I guess it's because poke bowls and sushi burritos are the new IT thing to eat.  I've only ever tasted these things in Paris so not sure how reliable my opinion is here.  I had the coco poke and the portion size was SMALL.  Even the bowls in Paris were bigger, so really that's a problem.  The portion was that of an appetizer and I'm not sure how they can sell it as a main.  I would have to eat at least 2 to feel somewhat full.    Also they list a bunch of ingredients that each bowl comes with, and basically they LIE.  There was ZERO kale and ZERO dragon fruit in my bowl (you can see from my picture).   I should have actually complained but I was eating with some friends I haven't seen in over 1 year after being away so I thought I would let it go.  Anyway, do NOT ever come here.  Total rip off."}
{"text":"The one thing you need to try here is...the poke nacho chips. It's a mix sweet, spicy and savoury! The first bite was like a party in my mouth of exploding flavours!   It is a big portion and I recommend sharing it with someone else while having a burrito on the side! (So you feel less guilty eating all the fried wonton chips with avocodo, jalapeno, corn, salmon/tuna, spicy mayo, a sweet sauce and cheese sauce)"}
{"text":"Although the flavour was good the nori was smaller than others so the resulting \"burrito\" was difficult to eat. Other places use larger prices to combat this issue. The nori was also untoasted so it was tough and lacked the proper consistency. Overall it was alright minus a couple of major flaws in the style of food."}
{"text":"I've only tried the sushi burrito here, and it was really good! There was really good rice to filling ratio (meaning they didn't skimp on the filling). Fish was fresh and flavours went well together. Service was friendly too."}
{"text":"At one point I would have given this place 5 stars, but after my last visit I feel as if the quality has gone down. I have ordered poke bowls, and sushi burritos from here, but I always find myself gravitating towards the Gringo's Delight. SU & BU used to be so good with their protein to filler ratio for these burritos, but my one today didn't seem to have much crab or tempura inside compared to usual. I'll likely still go back, hoping that It was a one off, and my favourite sushi burrito in the city didn't take a turn for the worse."}
{"text":"I was first exposed to Su&Bu during Poke Week (sampling 7 poke restaurants for $5 each). Unsurprisingly, because of the variety in their bowl (fresh mango, dragonfruit, seaweed salad, corn, purple cabbage, ginger and purple rice along with a generous serving of salmon/tuna), they were the winner of the Golden Fin award, and was hands down my favourite.   I've since returned for the regular sized portion of this Fish Poke and it continues to impress (13.99+tax). The only thing I would suggest is to ask for sauce on the side (they very generously sauce their poke so it's not for everyone).   There is also a Presotea within the Su&Bu so bbt craving can be satisfied at the same time!"}
{"text":"Had my first visit to there store today after having it at the CNE .... And WOW it was amazing. The staff where very welcoming and knowledgable, food was fresh and made in front of me, and the store looks so cool! I would recommend the fish & chips!  Great value for the price, I left full and happy.  I'll be making this a regular lunch spot of mine for sure!"}
{"text":"A bit disappointed at the size of my half sushi burrito (sushito?). I ordered a half size Salmon Samba Burrito for $6.99, which is $7.90 after tax on Ritual. It came to about 12cm, 4.9 inches.  The circumference is quite small too. The portion reminded me of ordering a kid size meal instead of the adult size.   The food overall tasted decent. The salmon was fresh and I actually enjoyed the sweet sauce in the burrito. The consumption part was another level. They didn't really have an eating area so I took it back to the office. The burrito was quite messy to be eating it at my desk. Once I unwrapped it and took the first bite, the ingredients just seemed to fall out one after another. You're better off to dump everything into the box and eat it with a fork. If you do that, this literally becomes your mini poke bowl.   Give the pricing and the small portion, I will prob go for the full burrito or something else for lunch."}
{"text":"This review is based on my mealpal experience today. With mealpal, I noticed that vendors tend to pre-make their items, so mealpal users end up receiving lunches that have been sitting there for an unidentified amount of time. To mitigate this, I always pick up my mealpal lunches at the earliest possible time slot. However, I was horrified when I opened up my takeout box from this restaurant. All the hype I had heard from friends and all the high reviews were debunked. My burrito was dripping with moisture from the hot rice, water content from the vegetables, and sauce.  It was seriously one soggy sushi burrito and it was blatant that  it had probably been sitting on the counter  for some time before I arrived exactly when mealpal pick-ups start. To top it all off, it was the smallest sushi burrito I have ever tried in  Toronto, there were only two or three dice sized slices of raw fish inside and the fish didn't seem to be fresh. I am against wasting food, but for one rare moment I considered throwing the entire mess away after several bites.    If you go here, I recommend ordering it normally at regular price to avoid having a soggy, bland meal."}
{"text":"So disappointed. I ordered take out and the whole is a few tiny pieces of salmon and 2 tiny pieces of tuna for their signature poke. Wow. Thats ultimately cheap. Now I cant do anything cuz Im just sat down on my couch and don't bother to go back to complain about it. See picture and verify yourself"}
{"text":"Had my first sushi burrito here. I'm not the biggest fan of sushi burritos because, like burritos, they get so messy and I end up eating half of it off the plate anyway. However, overall the sushi burrito was not bad. My partner loves the sushi burritos here.  I also tried the nacho poke bowl. DO NOT GET THIS. It is so odd. And after a few bites, I just felt sick. So much sauce. I look forward to going back and trying the more traditional poke bowl next time! Overall, friendly and fast service, and decent quality ingredients!"}
{"text":"I first tried their sushi burrito when they were at CNE this past sunmer. It was the samurachi one and it was underwhelming and not filling enough for the price. At CNE they gave me a 25% off coupon for when their John Street location opened.   Fast forward to now, I decided to use the coupon and try their other menu items. Located right beside Sweet Jesus, its a fairly good sized, although sort of narrow restaurant with ample seating.   I ordered the fish n' chips for 9.99, used the coupon and ended up paying 7.50. The wait was fairly short and there were a handful of people also waiting for their orders. The fish n' chips is essentially wonton chips with avocado, spicy cheese sauce, nori, fish eggs, and seasoned chunks of tuna and salmon. I have to say, it was delicious!! The crunch of the chips with the soft texture of the fish went well together. There was sauce on every single chip and it was extremely filling. I couldnt finish it in one sitting. Im definitely happy with my purchase.   Overall, I would recommend this place for the fish n' chips; maybe not the burritoes although they may have improved things since their term at CNE."}
{"text":"My friend informed me that SU&BU was a new hot spot specializing in sushi burritos / poke bowls. As a sushi enthusiast, I was all for it when she recommended coming here for a light lunch. Surprisingly, there wasn't a line out the door or a line at all (when things are hyped in NY, you'll see yourself waiting at least 1.5 hours in line)  As usual when everything on the menu sounds incredible, I struggled deciding on what I wanted. Ultimately, I went with the sushi burger because I have yet to see a sushi burger in NY. Plus, I love all of the ingredients that the burger was composed of - salmon, tuna, crab, seaweed salad, and spicy mayo, YUM.   Highly recommend you go with the burger as I enjoyed every single bite. The best aspect being the crispy rice, which I definitely thought was the defining and differentiating factor - I expected your standard soft white rice; this was purple rice coated in panko, so if you love spicy tuna crispy rice, this item is for you.   My friend got the nachos which ugh were equally as good. The nachos aren't your standard and typical tortilla chips, they're fried wontons; so the chips were lighter and held the salmon, tuna, and sauces well. Since my friend is dairy free, she asked for the shredded cheese and melted cheddar sauce on the side. As a result, due to her food allergy, they also gave her more eel and spicy mayo sauce on the side - A+ for great service! However, regardless if you have the same dairy free allergy, I would recommend getting the cheeses on the side because the nachos themselves were amazing without the cheese (I also like to control the amount of sauce too, so I found myself dipping more into the eel and spicy mayo).   They're on Ritual, so if you work nearby, this place HAS to be one of your go to's."}
{"text":"Great food Awesome concept....I have been looking for something different at lunch.   Place is great would recommend it to anyone looking for something new and fresh."}
{"text":"Had the sushi burrito and was alright. Ingredients were quite fresh. Fish was blend, so the soy sauce pack was handy.  I got the burrito thinking it'd be less messy to eat but turned out the opposite happened... The seaweed didn't even wrap around fully. The soy sauce would drip though.. Seaweed was a bit soggy too. Not something I'd crave again. Maybe I'll have better luck with poke next time."}
{"text":"This place has opened just recently and there was a huge line up at the counter for the first couple of weeks and didn't feel like to wait in the line. Now that the hype or perhaps the special is done, the lineups are not that bad.   Ordered a full Coco Loco sushi burrito which is vegan. I have never had a Sushi Burrito so was not sure what to expect taste wise. Instead of the regular nori sheet, saw that they offer a pink Soy based sheet for extra $1. Ordered that, but I wasn't charged, when I pointed the error, the cashier said no extra charge. Was definitely pleased.   One thing that I noticed was that they wear gloves while making the Burrito and pick up fish/tuna with gloves on but don't change the glove between orders. I requested that they please use a new glove, which they happily obliged.   The guy who made the SuBu was extra careful not to contaminate and worked well. The first one he made perfectly with tons of toppings did not make it to the end as it tore when rolling up. He had to start all over again and put in tons of toppings. And he made it! I was not optimistic but I have been wrong many times.   The taste was perfect. The Tofu, sauce, rice, sea weed salad, lettuce were perfect. The avocado was just enough. The Mango and coconut was there but did not get it throughout but when I did it was amazing. The Soy based nori was a good change and survived my walk to the desk and didn't feel damp or soggy.   Would definitely go again and will try to eat it right there as I believe it needs to."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since it opened and have tried the fish poke bowl and the Samurachi sushi burrito. The portions are slightly smaller than nearby poke bowl/sushi burrito venues, however the flavours and condiments come together really well. This is the main reason I keep coming back due to the consistency and convenient location. Orders come out quickly, there's dining space available, and I haven't had a problem ordering via food ordering apps like Ritual either.   Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"The Sushi Burrito was packed with ingredients and tasted extremely fresh and flavourful. The full size was surprisingly filling after thinking that it was in a tiny box. Will definitely stop by again with friends although it is on the pricier side."}
{"text":"I got the Samurachi Sushi burrito. It tasted great, with lots of flavour and toppings (seaweed salad, avocado, carrots, lettuce, mayo).  I got the \"Full\" sized porter. But I thought the portion was too small, it wasn't really filling. Considering it's \"fast food\" for $11.99 + tax, I was still hungry a few hours later.  Also, there aren't many seats, just one a table and a row with stools."}
{"text":"I got the fish poke without the shredded coconut. The taste was good and I liked that I got both salmon and tuna. The portions are small.   The service was very friendly which made it a great experience as well."}
{"text":"Hello my fellow yelpers! I want to let you know about the sushi burrito that I tried here. It was called the 'sensei'. (Salmon, bluefin tuna, shrimp tempura, avacado, sweet chilli and SU&BU sauce). I ordered the full/large size. When it came to my table, my first impression was that it didn't look that large at all. However after devouring it, I felt quite filled. One bite into this burrito made my mouth water for more. The texture and flavours worked amazing together. The big piece of shrimp tempura remained crunchy and did not get soggy at all. The crispness of the julien cucumber pieces added even more of a crunch and freshness. The salmon and tuna pieces were fresh.     I swear they had added crab meat in there too!, which as per there menu isn't part of this particular burrito. There wasn't an overwhelming amount of rice, in fact it thinly lined the walls of the burrito. I guess you can say this is another take on the traditional hand roll however because it's not in the shape of a cone, you can fit a lot more of the fillings. For $12.99 the price is kinda steep, considering I could probably go find an all-you- can-eat sushi place for lunch for a buck or two more."}
{"text":"Ritual Ordered: 3/5 I ordered directly through the Ritual App (which I highly recommend for loyalty points and worry-free automatic - can be trouble, payments).  The menu displayed on Ritual was the same as the restaurant's menu.    Price 4/5  The price for the premium burger I ordered ended up costing about $10.  I did not mind since this place is supposed to be high quality but i would have preferred Five Guys.  Quality 4/5  The quality of the food was fresh and flavourful.  I enjoyed it but it was the customer service that put me off and will less likely be returning to this place.  Customer Service 2/5  I ordered through Ritual during off-peak hours.  There were staff on hand but none of them acknowledge my existence and told every staff that I ordered through Ritual.  My burger was ready as I saw it being prepared but the staff that made it did not bag it and went to the back for his break I assume (he was gone for 10-mins).  The cashier was inattentive and brought it to her attention that my order was first, through Ritual and secondly the burger has been on the counter.  It had not been packaged for take-out.  Eventually, the cashier fetched and bagged my burger but did not say thank you.  I'm used to poor customer service in York Region's Asian restaurants but downtown, they're supposed to be better.  If I had tipped, I would have asked for my tip money back through Ritual."}
{"text":"dont waste your time here the proportions are very small and the customer service is bad the workers cant even speak English properly. my girl friend ordered the ponzu salmon bowl and it was drenched in so much sauce almost vinegary tasting it was unbearable. do yourself a favor and head over to mihitos which provides a much better sushi burrito"}
{"text":"I find their food to be yummy, fresh, and innovative! I love what they do with the different textures and flavours of ingredients in their dishes! I would recommend their sushi burger and poke nachos, in particular. Also, service is fast and efficient and pleasant :)  The only negative comment I would add is that sometimes, at the end of the day, their raw fish isn't as fresh and delicious as it normally is."}
{"text":"I was in the area and thought I'd try out a new poke place; ( I do love my poke!)  (Food:) THE SIGNATURE:  Honestly, as poke bowls go, it really wasn't that good.  I do like that they serve their food with purple rice, but because of whatever sauce or drippings they had with their toppings, the rice turned out soggy.  They had on top, some mango (too raw), some salmon (I requested only salmon, and it was pretty fresh), edamame beans, avocado and zucchini.  I felt that it was quite a westernized version of the dish and honestly, poke shouldn't be changed that much.  (Price:) THE SIGNATURE: $12.99  (Ambience:) The 'restaurant' was located inside a Yogurty's, which isn't really the best combination for ice cream and raw fish to go together....?  (Service:) Fine.  (Comparable:) Please go to Poke Eats or Tsuki Izakaya or something else.    (Overall:) This was a really disappointing poke place.  I'm sorry, the service was fine and everything, but I can't add any stars to a bad product."}
{"text":"It's really good and the price is actually cheap compared with lots of other sushi burrito places."}
{"text":"The sushi burrito here is so darn good. They pack it in there and you absolutely get your money's worth. I am a huge fan of this place."}
{"text":"I purchased the Signature Bowl and to be honest there was about 20gs of fish on my order which I was heavily disappointed. The salmon and tuna was mixed into cucumber and mango like a salad. I feel like I ordered a mango and cucumber bowl instead.   However the flavour is good, they offer purple rice instead of regular rice. I don't know if I will go back to be ripped off again."}
{"text":"WOW. Let me make to short and quick cuz I'm HEATED. We came here for dinner and I ordered a burrito and I asked for no cucumbers and the lady was so RUDE. She gave me a dirty look when I asked for no cucumbers (I think that was the manager). That's all I got to say. Msg me u know who u are."}
{"text":"First saw this at the CNE. Interesting concept to roll sushi into a burrito.  I got the Tuna Poke bowl for $13.55 (after tax). The toppings are beautifully presented in a bowl. and it's pretty filling!! There's raw fish chunks, avocado, seaweed salad, mango, dragon fruit, corn, carrot, red cabbage, sesame seeds, unagi sauce all on a bed of purple rice (probably from the red cabbage). All the flavours come together nicely. Crunch from the veggies, sweetness from mangoes, saltiness from soy sauce. Would've like to have more than 1.5 wonton strip and 1 piece of kale in my bowl, but other than that, it was yummy! A little pricey for $13.55 to be honest but CNE food is overpriced anyway.  They're opening 2 locations in downtown Toronto soon. Have a feeling this will be a blooming business!"}
{"text":"My friend and I met up for lunch so I decided to give this place a try. We met at 1230 on a Thursday and I was surprised that it was not super busy. Both of us order the fish poke bowl and enjoyed their take of the dish. There were chips, mango, sashimi, avocado, seaweed salad and sauce but I did not notice the coconut.  There was one table for four and the rest were bar tops facing the window. There was the Presto tea beside but I didn't see anyone ordering from there. The bowl itself is different from other places but I think it was slightly more expensive as well.  Maybe it was due to the mango and other ingredients.  Not sure if I would return but it is an option for lunch although a bit far from my office."}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get. 8-9 dollars for half a sushi burrito. On top of that it's not very tasty and veggies in my burrito didn't look fresh either. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"What you have in front of you is not just food, it is the result of a long process towards perfection. If sushi is the egg, sushi burrito is the caterpillar, then sushi burger is a butterfly so beautiful and majestic, that even Narcissus had to look away from his own reflection. The sushi burger is no Pokémon, nor are the chefs Pokémon Masters. However, one thing is for certain, whatever resides within the taste of the Sushi burger, the chefs most definitely captured it ALL between those 2 delicious crispy rice buns.  When you order it, the burger comes already cut in half, with the cross section facing you when you open the box. And what a grandiose sight that is - you have just the right amount of surimi crab, avocado, seaweed salad, and other ingredients that act as a soft throne reserved only for salmon and tuna of the highest class. And by \"highest class\", I mean literally of the highest class. I am lead to believe, by the taste alone, that Neptune himself cut a deal with Su&Bu to sacrifice and deliver to them salmon and tuna of only the highest ranks amongst his own King's Guard. All in all, ingredients play so well together, if they were musicians, the music played can even make Mozart sob with jealousy.   So let's cut to the chase - what does the burger actually taste like? Is this the ultimate sushi salmon and rice experience? This is a rhetorical question, because the moment you actually try it, you forget what you asked. The ultimate experience simply becomes the ONLY food experience. All the other food becomes noise, only necessary for energy required to make it to Su&Bu and order the Sushi Burger."}
{"text":"Meh. Was hoping it could be something new and exciting, and since they are inside the Yogurty's store, and I don't like Yogurty's ice cream, but take my kids there, I thought this may be something I'd eat, while they have their treat.  Well, I won't. It is a bizarre take on giant sushi rolls, that doesn't taste like much - cheap, AYCE style ingredients, and an overall strange endeavour.  Won't repeat."}
{"text":"It took me a while to find a poke bowl that suits my tastebuds but I've finally found it here at SU&BU!   I went with their fish poke bowl here and it was just PACKED with so many different types of ingredients. This bowl has everything in it, and it just worked. I've been wanting to eat a good premade bowl and this is it. It might be too much for some people, but if you're that type of person that likes getting everything for your subs, pizzas, and burgers, get this! There's a lot of sweet flavours in this bowl coming from all the mangoes, dragon fruit, seaweed salad, and pickled ginger. There's generous amounts of Tobiko, and avocado, and the fish was marinated nicely. There's no need for soy sauce at all, as the salt from the fish balances it out.   The downside is that their wasn't enough of this deliciousness. The portion size left you wanting more. I think while the toppings were plentiful, there definitely could have been more purple rice; I found myself eating more of the toppings, which is a weird complaint because more places tend to give your more rice than toppings. So a minor complaint here."}
{"text":"I went to SU&BU's downtown location once before and really enjoyed it so I was quite disappointed when this Mississauga location failed to provide the same experience.   I had remembered I really liked SU&BU's original/signature poke bowl. It was the perfect balance of all the components of a good poke bowl. You had the sweet, the savory, the crispy, and the umami. I really wasn't sure why it wasn't on the menu here at Square One. Taking a look at the menu online at SU&BU what we had ordered here isn't on the menu on their website. There seems to be a more limited selection here at Square One.  The bowl I had ordered was excessively sweet which I didn't expect. There was a lot of sweet components in the mango, the sweet thai chili sauce, the ginger, and the seaweed salad but it was just too much and there was no harmonious balance. Portions seemed even more small than I had remembered as well, and one piece of kale had taken up nearly a quarter of the bowl.   Overall I was quite disappointed and there's definitely better poke bowl options in Missisauga."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. I got Half Gringo Delight and it was amazing.  The only thing I found mildly infuriating is their take out paper box won't \"lock\". It drove me nuts for a good 15 mins and then I gave up."}
{"text":"got the fish poke, not worth the price at that quantity. tastes great, but flavour is very fusion; has fruits like mango and dragon fruit? i've had a lot better elsewhere in the city for much tastier and larger portion; also great location for me as i'm always nearby"}
{"text":"Since summer has started, I have been going to a lot of different places for poke; yesterday I decided to try SU&BU. Maybe I should've gotten the sushi burrito instead of the poke bowl. The bowl was quite small for the price (compared to other places such as Poke Guys or Rolltation). However, the variety of items was great; there was salmon, tuna, mango, avocado, tobiko, passionfruit, seaweed, and even nachos (which were delicious!) It tasted great too; everything was super fresh. Would come back if there were a larger portion."}
{"text":"poke nachos !!! crispy wonton chips topped with salmon, tuna, massago, avocado, corn, green onions, jalapeno, nori strips, sriracha aioli, sweet sauce, nacho cheese so yummy !!! the box wasn't full to the top but after eating the whole box with delight I was full all day. Wonton chips were nice and crispy, delicious with sweet sauce, salmon and tuna were fresh and there was plenty to enjoy. Menu price is 9.99 for this item.  it was just amazing, first time in this hidden gem, will come in the future for sure and wanna try everything they are offering.   Service was fast and efficient with smiles, place was was clean and atmosphere was modern and warm."}
{"text":"I participated in Toronto Poke Week Passport and they were on it.  For $5 I got a gorgeous salmon poke bowl  (my friend got one as well).     This sweet bowl has everything :  purple rice, kale, salmon, avocado , taro chips, tobiko, carrots, scallion, fresh pineapple pieces, dragon fruit, and my favourite...little deep fried crispy chewy coconut purple rice balls!    I totally thought I would be sick of Poke by now but this bowl tasted so delightfully refreshing and different that we both enjoyed it fully!    Being next to Scotiabank theatre , this is sure to be my go to spot for healthy and delicious food before or after my movie now.    The service wasn't fast, but moved at an okay place through the lunch rush....everyone around us that ordered from the regular menu enjoyed their food as well.    As expected...they won as the best poke joint out of the 7 places by popular vote .    They deserve it!"}
{"text":"Their signature poke bowl was decorative and featured an ample amount of tuna and salmon. I would definitely consider coming back here to try their burrito options."}
{"text":"Came back 2 weeks later. Sensei roll was much fresher tasting and they now have opened up both doors! The packaging was a lot better this time and it fit perfectly inside the box compared to the first time. Nothing else to add or subtract, but they were a bit more efficient on orders than my first time there!"}
{"text":"Had their OG poke bowl for dinner which included avocado, massage, purple rice, salmon, tuna, lettuce (which I had gotten instead of kale), seaweed salad, and spicy mayo sauce. I had taken out the mango, coconut and sweet chilli sauce because it was a little too weird for me (they were bmvery good about substitutions).  Aside from the massive amounts of salmon and tuna, the taste was meh. I felt like I had no rice which I thought would be a good thing but then everything felt off balance. The avocado was a little too mushy for my liking and the lettuce didn't seem fresh either. For $16 I feel like it wasnt worth it. There's other food in the area I'll probably go to next time or if I'm looking for sushi burritos or poke bowls I'll probably check out a different place"}
{"text":"After eating at Poke Guys (which I really liked), I wanted to try other poke places to compare.   I ordered their Signature Poke Bowl. The menu says avocado, but unfortunately my bowl came with more like an avocado mash. First off, not enough rice to go with the salmon and tuna like other poke places. Secondly, with the mango, soggy avocado mash and not enough rice to soak up the sauce, this poke bowl was a disaster. It was so watery at the end that it made my stomach turn.   I would probably stir clear from here and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and absolutely love their sushi burritos!! Highly recommended to those who have tried it and for those who needs a quick bite to go!   This place is right beside sweet Jesus so sometimes, you see a huge line up beside it, but don't be alarmed because even if it's a line up here, it's worth it!   We got the Samurachi (full $12.99) and the Sensai (full $13.99)  You can get your burritos for half size or full size. If you want a quick small snack, go for the small size. But the big one will definitely be more of a lunch size item. Both of these burritos have both salmon and tuna in it. There's tons of veggies and the sauce is amazing ! Spicy yet a little salty to taste. I love that there's not a whole lot of rice in it because who doesn't love to eat the stuff right?!!!!   We also tried the taro chips for $4. Couldn't stop eating them. They not only had salt but added some Japanese flavoring on it. Delish! I find it a little oily but it's ok !!!   Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My kids love coming to yoghurtys. So, to see a SU BU, sushi burrito place...I was REALLY happy. Once I placed my order it took forever to make because the management of this place is too busy taking pictures and posting them on yelp...I was there when a majority of these posts (made by them) were created. For instance, the sushi burger, is one made by \"them\". The manager was also making some weird video of the girl making the food, so as I waited...and waited. My kids were getting agitated, and I found this rude. The girl serving me was nice, she welcomed me since it was my first time trying SU BU. The sushi burrito was great! I liked the tempura shrimp and crab meat in there. Ingredients and flavour were on point. I'll probably visit again, but only if I don't see management around taking pictures for their own promotion."}
{"text":"4/5, one of the best Poke and Sushi burrito places I've had in Toronto! I'd recommend trying if you want a quick bite to eat. Expect to pay ~$10, unless you order a half.  If you like sushi/poke and are looking for a spot for quick food, check out SU&BU! The restaurant isnt fancy, but rather more like a hip fast food restaurant and shares its counter with PrestoTea (bubble tea). There are a number of different options, including sushi burritos, poke bowls and even a sushi burger.  I ordered the Samurachi and Gringo's Delight Burritos, as well as the classic Fish Poke bowl. The burritos were quite filling and had a generous amount of fish in them. I fell in love with the Samurachi burrito, as the sauce was amazing. The presentation is really great too! However, I felt the Gringo's Delight had a weird flavor combination (as it had nacho cheese) and wouldnt recommend. The poke bowl was great! Amazing presentation, generous portion and everything you'd expect in a bowl."}
{"text":"Given the ingredients like kale, beets, and dragon fruit -this is a really healthy salad option for lunch.   Having said that, if you order from the menu, you have to be very adventurous when it comes to food. You have to be okay with eating kale, mango, raw salmon, raw beets, fish roe (fish eggs), avocado, and dragonfruit etcetc - all in the same bite. This is tossed in an orange-citrus sauce. If that flavour combo doesn't sound okay to you, you can make your own bowl.   I think the chef went a little crazy with the poke bowls because the taste is just so random. Maybe he just tossed together some nice colours and thought it 'looks like poke'. Did anyone actually taste test this stuff? Does everything work well together? By far this is the most experimental poke place I've tried in Toronto.  Fish is mediocre quality, but ok for the price and location. Quinoa is pretty wet. Fruits and veggies are fresh."}
{"text":"SU&BU has great taste and amazing service, but small portions. I tried the Fish Poke for $8 (using Ritual to get a discount from $11.99) and it was delicious! They even added coconut flakes and ginger. Unlike many Poke joints that fill their bowls with rice, SU&BU gives a very generous portion of fish and toppings. The only downside is the small portion did not fill me up at all. Great for a snack, but not for a meal - especially at their prices."}
{"text":"Visited SU&BU late on a Monday evening (8:10).  As I walked in I noticed there are 3 staff members, 1 actually working (ie: making food) and the other 2 are cleaning.  Was greeted by a friendly gal and after indicating I hadn't been there before so would like to know what the more popular items were.  I decided on the Samurachi burrito.  I had asked to go light on a couple of items and noticed that they were heaped on.  One of the gals cleaning came over and asked what I was having (instead of actually asking the gal making it standing mere feet away).  I reiterated and she entered in the order and then walked away.  Leaving me to gather pay for and gather my own receipt (seriously was the cleaning so much effort you couldn't stay for 20 more seconds ?).  Got my burrito and took it back to my hotel to enjoy.   Overall,  Ok, so the food is good.  I liked my burrito and the ingredients were fresh.  There was too much cabbage and cucumber (the two items I asked to put less in).  The burrito is 8 inches long and albeit it's good, pretty much everything else about this is very average or sub-par.  The price for this was nearly $15.  There are better prices out there considering the contents, and the service.  It's good, but there are better options out there."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came by SU&BU for a quick and early dinner.  The interior is set up for a grab-and-go style. There are bar seats and 2 tables of 4 available but space is limited. We were able to grab a bar seat since not many people were there went we went.  * SU&BU BURGER (4/5) (Salmon, tuna, surimi crab, green onion, avocado, seaweed salad, arugula, coconut, lettuce, carrot, red cabbage, sesame mayo, sweet sauce, sriracha) I was surprised at how much I liked the burger!! I chose purple rice, which is fried up and replaces the usual bread buns. There were a lot of ingredients stuffed inside and seaweed salad was the one ingredient that popped the most out of them all. It's a messy eat, but I really liked it!  * FISH POKE BOWL (5/5) (Tuna, salmon, massago, avocado, mango, shredded coconut, seaweed salad, ginger, sweet chili sauce, su&bu sauce) Everyone's biggest concern when eating raw foods is how fresh are the ingredients. The raw fishes in my poke bowl were fresh and delicious!! They were marinated with sauces, it tasted so good :) I'd definitely order this again on my next visit."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this location after walking around one evening spent at the CN Tower!  The food is fresh and yummy, prices are very reasonable and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"It was fairly empty on a weekday for lunch. We ordered our poke bowls on Ritual - and they were prepared on time as said by the app. However, the portions were really small and did not have much sauce (other than a packet of soya sauce) included. I was disappointed as it didn't have much flavour and definitely did not fill me up. Would not be back again."}
{"text":"Ordered one of the sushi burrito and it was my first sushi burrito ever! It's not bad although the $1 additional for imitation crab was a bit expensive. Also I was expecting the seaweed to be chewy since it became soft from the rice but actually it wasn't. One thing though I think the wax paper that wraps around the burrito should be changed since it smells so plastiky/toxic. Taro chips was ok. Can tell that some are fresh and some not. The seasoning on the chip is also not even. Some very salty and some very oily.  Overall I would like to explore other poke bowl and sushi burrito places before coming back."}
{"text":"Signature poke bowl. Materials are fresh and tasty. But portion is too small. Only half full. And pricy - $15 after tax"}
{"text":"I went here specifically for the poke, but unfortunately, the fish was bland. Not like the so fresh you don't need any seasoning bland, but more like it's okay quality, which is why there's not much flavor. I added more soy sauce and spicy mayo than I would've liked to give it more punch. People are nice here, so I guess if you're ever super craving poke, this spot is okay."}
{"text":"The Fish Poke Bowl was terrible; way better at Poke Guys! The spicy flavour I requested in my sauce was non-existent. On the plus side, they made my couple substitutions (edamame instead of mango and spicy sauce) without extra charge or fuss. I won't be going back though."}
{"text":"- Sushi burger ($9.99 + tax): was the only thing I tried at Su&Bu. The burger buns were basically fried purple rice and was filled up with different types of vegetables and salmon sashimi and some sauces. This is the most flavourful burger I have ever tried in my life, so much better than sushi burrito or poke bowls. The crispness of the buns were so enjoyable to chew and the sauce came with this was made so well w sashimi. The burger looks very small but everything inside was over-filled which made me pretty full afterwards. - Portion: it was a good amount of food for me but I would say average for other ppl  - Price: a bit pricey but that makes sense since it's located right in entertainment district. - Definitely will come back whenever I crave their sushi burger"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Square One for a long time and I noticed that SU&BU recently opened right across from the Dollarama. Being a fan of sushi and poke bowls, I just HAD to try this place out with a few of my friends. I ordered a poke bowl, but my two friends got the sushi burrito so here's the rundown:  Food: I got the signature poke bowl which came with tuna, salmon, purple rice, kale, zucchini noodle, radish noodle, edamame, mango, cucumber, avocado, ginger, and a sesame ponzu sauce. HOLY there were a lot of ingredients in this one. To be honest, I have had a lot better in downtown Toronto and even in Hamilton. Personally, I thought it was overkill with the amount of ginger that was in my poke bowl. On top of that, it was INCREDIBLY saucy. I felt like they drenched all of the veggies in their ponzu sauce which overpowered the flavours of the vegetables and protein. As well, the tuna and salmon portion size was quite small and left me with something to be desired after eating it. Lastly, when the bowl was served, it was dirty on the edges and I had to clean it up so that I could take a picture of it; whoever was making it seemed to be in a rush.   My two friends got the sensai (full) burrito (tuna, salmon, crab meat, shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber, carrot, pico mango sauce) and the samurachi (skinny) burrito (tuna, salmon, masago, cucumber, avocado, red cabbage, tempura bits, sweet sauce, sweet chili vinaigrette sauce). All of these burrito come with rice, nori, lettuce, and sesame seeds. It was quite funny because while my poke bowl was incredibly saucy, my friends found their burritos to be under-seasoned with the sauce and had to add more sauce to their burritos; they said it reminded them of eating kimbap but without the soy sauce. There wasn't anything notable about these burritos except HOLY was it messy to eat. Normally, we're used to not making much of a mess while eating these burritos but I believe they weren't so tightly wrapped and thus, all the wrapped food kept falling out as they ate the burritos. It definitely wasn't a clean dining experience.  Atmosphere: The restaurant design is pretty classic and modern. You order your food, wait for the employees to make it, and then sit down in one of the area (either on the high table or lower tables). There's vines hanging off a white floating ceiling, which makes for a pleasant and pseudo nature-like feel to the dining experience. This place is very family friendly and there's plenty of space for sitting. You can tell that the owners heavily considered the design of the restaurant as an important aspect of the customer's dining experience.  Service: Service was typical of what you'd find in a fast-food chain restaurant. The employees tried their best to help out with our order, despite the language barrier, but I felt as though they could have been more knowledgeable with recommendations as my friends and I were pretty indecisive with our orders. Other than that, the food was ready very quickly, which caters towards customers who are looking for quick service.  Price: Poke Bowl ($12.99) Sensai Full ($13.99) Samurachi Skinny ($7.99) The price here is comparable to other poke places and portions sizes are fair (With the exception of the little protein I got in my bowl and the excessive amount of ginger)  Verdict: I recently discovered SU&BU while visiting Square One and it was definitely a letdown in terms of food taste. The poke bowls were over-sauced, had little protein, and an uneven proportion of condiments. Meanwhile, the burritos were under-sauced and were incredibly messy to eat. I've heard many positive reviews about the downtown Toronto location, but this location definitely did not live up to the hype of the other SU&BU. I am giving a 2 star for this as this location definitely needs to work on sauce control with the poke bowls and wrapping the burritos tighter so that they're not falling apart and creating a mess while eating them."}
{"text":"This is an update to a previous review, and this is my second visit to this particular location of SU&BU. I have to admit that my first visit to this location was quite unmemorable. But how things can change on a second visit! I was in the area, and decided to give this place another shot since I was so kindly left a message by the owner. It was the first warm day after winter and when we arrived the entire store was slammed with people and children with bodies flying all over. Since this location is located inside of Yogurtys, everyone was bouncing around high on froyo sugar. My significant other and I ended up going for a sushi burrito (tuna tango) and a poke bowl (the signature). I must admit we didnt have high expectations, as this is a small kiosk in a larger store coupled with our last experience here. But we were very pleasantly surprised at just how tasty and fresh tasting things were!   The tuna tango was quite well made. The nori on the outside perfectly wrapped around the ingredients. The roll was not filled with rice, but rather a nice blanket around. The tuna was quite pleasant and fresh tasting. The lettuce gave it a very nice airy feeling, while the tempura bits and cucumber gave a nice light crunch and texture while the avocado helped smooth it all out. I rarely say this, especially for a kiosk/take out counter type place but this was actually quite delightful on a warm spring day. All the flavours blended together to give an over all filled yet satisfied feeling. My only issue with this roll though, is that the nori was a bit on the chewy side. When you order a sushi hand roll from a restaurant, it is best eaten as fresh as possible as the nori (seaweed) should be nice and crunchy and cleanly break apart as you bite into it. You can tell a hand roll or nori was sitting some where for a while if the nori is a bit chewier.  The poke bowl also continued the trend of satisfaction. All the ingredients tasted nice, crispy and flavorful with nothing soggy or mushy like it was sitting out all day. Everything blended together nicely, and the presentation was quite appealing. The ginger in the middle of the salad also provided a nice light crunch without over powering - I was a bit concerned with the amount intially given as ginger can easily over power a dish and your mouth. But my concerns were proved unwarranted.  Im going to chalk up my last interaction with this place to growing pains. As I do believe this location has not been open for very long, and perhaps theres still a learning curve. But I will not hesitate to swing by this place again if I want to grab a bite in the area. SU&BU occupies a very unique space in the food market as people become more health concious, and veer away from traditional fast food places. Traditional fast food places (lets say McDonalds) are loaded with sodium, and are just generally over processed and deep fried. Sure it feels awesome while you eat it, but right after having McDonalds I always feel just over full. While a traditional sit down restaurant could offer you more healthier options (such as a full sushi restaurant) but that would require time to sit down and order and eat. SU&BU allows you to drive up, order something and then off you go. So you get the best of both worlds. Grab and go, fresh and filling."}
{"text":"They have potential for for their unique taste and style however, when it comes to sushi, we all know how important it is to have good tasting rice. The rice at SU&BU is quite soggy and mushy, that leaves the meal end off in a bad note. Tried out their poke and burrito with the same texture.   However, I have to give credit for their Samurachi burrito as the vinegraitte in the roll is quite tasty. I had their Salmon Sambu roll last year at CNE and it was a bad experience for me as the fish wasn't the freshest. It still isn't quite up there but they definitely have potential to be better."}
{"text":"Sushi burritos! I was walking up John street and was hungry so I decided to go in.  It's sandwiched between and ice cream and tea place.    I ordered a half salmon samba minus the jalapeño peppers.  Service was quite fast and I got my wrap to eat in the restaurant.  I was happy to see generous chunks of salmon sashimi in the wrap. The wrap was really stuffed so the nori sheet was busting at the seams so as I ate, the sushi burrito began falling apart.   I recommend getting the takeout box along with a utensil so when it does fall apart towards the end, you have something to hold and eat it with! The flavor comes from the sesame based dressing and I liked how the taste of nori complements the purple cabbage and carrots.  It reminds me of a poke salmon bowl but in wrap format :d"}
{"text":"While some might question the wisdom of grabbing lunch from a quick serve place across from a local high school, given the higher price point this place was not too full of seemingly female teen patrons only. Service was friendly.  I had to be in the plaza anyway and I love healthy meals on the go. This place will pack you full of healthy fats and fibre.  If you still have room you can have yogurty's froyo for dessert - under common management.  Today I got the salmon poke bowl to go. Reading the previous reviews I opted to sub purple rice for the quinoa. Not cheap at just over$13, but packed with delicious, healthy ingredients including for some reason kale although that was not mentioned on the ingredient list. I could have used a few more chunks of salmon, but regardless, this was a win for me. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Debating between a 3 or 4 star, but ended up giving 4 stars because I will probably go back and it's one of the tastier healthy lunch options downtown. Go before 11:45 if you don't want to wait in line! Ordered the Samurachi burrito full size for lunch. I didn't taste much of the sweet chilli sauce so the burrito was a bit blend, but they probably didn't want to put too much as it would make the seaweed soggy. But really, you just need to add a bit of soy sauce, which u can grab on your way out, to make it taste good! The full size burrito will fill you up for lunch!"}
{"text":"I've had poké bowls all over toronto and su&bu was by FAR the best! We ordered a poké bowl, fish and chips and the salmon burrito! The food was 11/10 the service was 10/10. The restaurant was very aesthetically pleasing, I would highly recommend su&bu to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"A cosy sushi burrito and poke bowl shop. Has your standard fare sushi items wrapped in nori or unwrapped in a bowl with some greens. Flavours are decent and refreshing. If you're getting a burrito be careful as the sauce is runny and things often turns messy. Main concern is the portion size which is quite small for its price tag. You're not getting a lot of value in ingredients, service, or labour for what you are paying (e.g. pre-tax $12.99 for this poke bowl). I mean it is a fast food assembly line of prepared raw ingredients placed or rolled together that I'm taking away from a counter; I can't really justify the dollars given the small amount of food I'm receiving. It's acceptable as a convenient infrequent snack but I wouldn't be a regular unless this changes."}
{"text":"This place looked like it had a lot of promise, but it didn't quite deliver. I got the salmon ponzu poke bowl. The amount of fish in the bowl was super small, and overall the contents weren't enough to be filling. The saving grace was the taste of the salmon - very delicious, but the portion and for what you're paying really is not worth it. My friend ordered the sushi burrito and noted the same issue: way too small for what we were paying for. If you do decide to come just be aware of how small the portions are."}
{"text":"On my trip to Toronto, while walking around the downtown area my boyfriend and I decided to stop by this place and pick up some food to go so we can enjoy it later back at the place we were staying. And we weren't impressed. They people serving us were very nice but the food itself was just average. It really wasn't this spectacular thing and doesn't about it stood out. It was just average. Although I don't know how great sushi burritos could be because I know they recently became all the rage but this place was just okay."}
{"text":"Compared to one of the other sushi burrito places I've been I'd say the fish was better, and the overall taste as well. It's a bit smaller than some of the others but the quality if there. I'd be interested to try the \"fish n chips\" on my next visit."}
{"text":"I had their sushi burger. It was alright. I've had a Ramen burger before from somewhere else and that tasted like it made MUCH more sense than this sushi burger. Overall it was good, but didn't impress me enough to ever have it again...especially over a regular juicy burger.  And their bowls and burritos are okay. For being one of the originals, they haven't really improved on the concept."}
{"text":"I came to this place twice, once for the burrito and once for the bowl. Gotta say the only thing good about this place is the fish. Everything else is mediocre if not bad. The burrito had really soft and wet seaweed wrapping and the rice was way too sour. The bowl was ok, the purple rice was good. The bowl had way too much radish and cucumber and it made the rest of the bowl really bland. Also a quarter of my bowl was ginger, don't know why they would put in so much. It's ok at best if you're craving some sort of raw fish"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying poke for the first time in my life at SU&BU today.   I had the Tuna Poke and I'm so glad I tried it. It had a various mix of ingredients which I would never think of putting together, and all the flavours really came together well. It was sweet, salty, and tangy all at the same time, with the buttery flavour of tuna and salmon in each bite. I would say that the quantity of fish in it was not necessarily 'a lot', but it was definitely not on the cheap side either.  If the prices were each $1 or $2 less, I would definitely come here more often. For now, I'll only be returning when I feel like splurging $13 on a lunch. If it had to do with taste alone though -- I'd see myself being here very frequently.  I ordered through Ritual so I cannot say much about the dining experience. It did look nice and comfortable and had a bit of a \"modern\" feel to it. This place is designed as a quick-eat location, so it's not ideal for groups.  Overall a pleasant first experience, and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place and went when they first opened but was underwhelmed by the experience. The portion sizes for the burritos and poke bowls is on the smaller side. I found that the rice used in their dishes wasn't fresh enough, therefore, making the taste sub-par. The poke bowl was overly sweet with the amount and type of sauce they use which ruined the otherwise good ingredients. I'll be back to try the new menu and update my review if things change."}
{"text":"Shout out to SU &BU for having the worst Poke bowls ever. First ... They're TINY for $13 bucks and second you can't even customize and make your own. There are no sauces or options or spices. It's complete barf in a bowl. I honestly had a few bites and threw it out and went to Cali Love for another poke bowl ... I expected big things from this place and ugh so disappointed. I wish Union juice stayed here..!!!!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. First of all, I'm obsessed with sushi. So you can imagine my excitement when we happened to stumble by this place while hunting Pokémon in Toronto. Very reasonably priced - especially for the contents of their sushi burritos. I had the Sensei burrito - it had crab, salmon, tuna, and shrimp tempura amongst the standard sushi roll contents. My husband had the Gringo burrito - all his contents were cooked. Also very tasty. The staff was helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty rushed and sloppy poke bowl if you ask me. Asked for the signature bowl and received one of their other bowls instead. The topping were thrown onto the bowl with 0 care. Ended up looking like a stir fry. Staff seemed a little clueless and overwhelmed even though I was the only customer in line."}
{"text":"Even the double is a small portion size. I was left feeling hungry. The flavour in my spicy salmon burrito was lacking when I got it home.   I will stick to one of the other sushi burrito places in the area.   The staff were nice and efficient enough."}
{"text":"Their combos are really strange, I had hard time choosing anything there. Finally decided on Tuna Tango. It took over 30 minutes for me to get my order. When I got it, the fish didn't taste fresh. Overall, the place is really overpriced for what you get. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try SU&BU's sushi burger ever since they first opened their downtown locations but never got around to it. So I'm super happy that they've now opened this location north of Toronto.  On my visit, I had their sushi burger of course, which did not disappoint. The rice bun was hot and crispy, the fish and other ingredients tasted fresh, and overall it was very tasty. For $9.99, I thought the price was reasonable too, especially since the burger itself is pretty filling.   The place itself shares a space with Yogurty's, and has a decent amount of seating. I only wish they had somewhere to wash your hands after, as eating the sushi burger can get a bit messy. :P  Overall, a great first visit and I will definitely be back to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"Poke was overall OK for me. I had the Classic. The one thing that could be improved is to have the fish cut into smaller cubes... its almost overwhelming to eat a huge chunk of raw fish, after a few bites, it can be a tad weird."}
{"text":"Sushi burger ($9.99 + tax) from Su&Bu at Square One Mississauga. This just goes to prove that sushi can be made into anything.    A little pricey for the amount of protein that we're getting. Definitely SMALL PORTIONS. Plus, I find them inconsistent. The first time I ordered these, I got the white sushi rice on the bun. The next time I did, they gave me the purple rice - which was SPICY.  I didn't know that they offer it on 2 different kinds..... and I wasn't aware probably because I WASNT ASKED which one I wanted anyway.    The concept is nice though.  But would I come back? Maybe.... just to try their SUSHI NACHOS. Or maybe not.... because that's another item that's overpriced in the menu."}
{"text":"Sushi Burrito, Poke is the new trend in Toronto food scene.   I enjoyed the Sushi Burrito from SU&BU; fish is fresh, the flavours are well balanced.   But I am not sure if the full burrito justifies for $12 ($13.5 with tax) for the portion."}
{"text":"went here on a Saturday night before work and i was surprised that it wasn't busy, hence my service was speedy.  i got thr sushi burger for a total of $11.30 after tax and it definitely filled me up. it was served in a takeout box and was appealing to the eyes.  i thought the burger was fresh with big chunks of tuna throughout. there was a nice crunch from the buns being deep fried but also from the purple cabbage. i liked the fact that there was arugula which added a nice earthy flavour to this seafood creation.   i didn't like the fact that the wasabi came on the side. i tried half of the burger without wasabi and i gotta say the half with it on was so much better! the wasabi pulled every flavour (sweet, sour, creamy from the sauces and ingredients)together making it a flavour explosion in your mouth. they definitely should incorporate wasabi as the \"ketchup\" to the burger.   their stools were small and uncomfortable"}
{"text":"I was having a bad day and the Cute little chubby cute man made my burrito and asked how my day was. So nice to have someone ask and give good customer service to me.  The burrito was well made and the place is well lit with very cute little matching decorations.. Cute decorations for a cute place and cute employees.  I would recommend this place and definitely the fish and chips. Thank you to the  cute friendly and smiley  arturo! Will definitely be back here soon"}
{"text":"I spontaneously bought The OG Bowl for lunch today from Su&Bu. I have never eaten here before and asked the cashier what the most popular item was, and that was what he suggested.   The fish was plentiful in terms of the portion, and it tasted alright - not great but definitely not bad. The purple rice was tasty, and I liked the inclusion of mashed avocado. However, I found the ingredients overall to be kind of a random mish-mash of things. It was a little overwhelming. From memory, I can recall fish and kale and seaweed salad and mango and rice and huge pieces of pickled ginger and avocado and fish eggs and a massive serving of some sort of orange sauce...it was just a bit too much, and altogether, it sort of ruined the overall flavour IMO.   It was okay, but I don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"Update - owner reached out and offered me a free poke bowl. So I got another one at the Bay Adelaide centre - and it was great. Fish was fresh.  So it prob just was a bad batch before (and I didn't get a stomach ache that time!)."}
{"text":"This is a completely westernized poke joint that uses the diced raw fish mixed in salad/rice.  Sushi Bagel ($3.99) This looks bigger in pictures than in person. Thought it was cute and gave it a try. The \"bagel\" is actually a ring of marinated rice. I like how it wasn't just normal rice and its mixed in with some cooked tuna bits I think? which adds good flavor. The toppings on top of the rice are really thinly sliced, so just keep in mind this menu item is mainly for the rice.This was one of the most decently priced item on the menu.  Fish Poke ($11.99) Nothing compared to traditional poke. A bowl of raw tuna, salmon, massago, avocado, mango, seaweed salad, ginger, and diced dragon fruit topped on purple rice and mixed kale salad. It says it's mixed in SU&BU sauce but I swear it tastes exactly like Teriyaki (the fast food chain) their specialty teriyaki sauce. This bowl was light and refreshing - an okay amount of protein, and not a lot of rice. Ingredients were fresh, tasty! Quite expensive for what you get imo.  Poke Nachos ($9.99) Crispy wonton chips topped with raw salmon, raw tuna, massago, avocado, corn, green onions, cheese and drizzles of sweet sauce. I'm normally not a fan of nachos, but I liked this. Probably because it wasn't exactly nacho chips. It's supposed to be wonton chips but it felt more like shrimp chips but extra crispy - regardless, it tasted good. Love how the chips were super crunchy and with all the sauce the chips didn't get soggy at all. Decent amount of protein, and with all the ingredients the nachos were very flavorful and tasty.   Overall, although this place is not authentic poke, but I would say one of the better poke bowl places. Just note that it is expensive if you want to eat enough to be full."}
{"text":"My friend mentioned a sushi burrito place he liked near where he lived outside of Toronto. A few days later I was with another friend and we saw SU&BU, and since we both remembered the sushi burrito comment we figured we'd give it a try. It didn't disappoint.  It really isn't a burrito per se, just a gigantic hand roll, and thus tastes exactly how you'd imagine it would taste. That isn't necessarily a bad thing depending on how much you like hand rolls and sushi.  The fish and chips here are delicious, but also a gigantic mess. You could throw the thing in a blender and essentially it would look the same."}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing poke bowl I've ever had. The rice was mushy and soggy, all the vegetables such as the zucchini and toppings were soaking wet in vegetable water I saw the server have to squeeze it out. Barf. At $14 a bowl you'd think it would be good quality but it's so cheap. The sashimi was stringy and was not cut properly agents the grain (this is sushi 101) no one was in line and I should have taken this as a hint... this place needs to step it up! Tons of places around to get a good poke bowl so don't go here!"}
{"text":"Got to try their sushi burger and since the buns are fried purple rice patties, it took awhile to make. I came at around 6pm on a weekday and there was a short line. I did not expect the burger to be so big so it's totally worth it! It came with multiple ingredients such as lettuce, fish, seaweed salad, mayo & avocado. Something to keep in mind is that it gets really messy so bring some extra napkins! I saved it to eat 2 hours after and the buns were still crunchy and yummy."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite before the movie. Sushi burritos are soooo delicious. Love the tempura shrimps in them. Among all the sushi burrito places I have tried in Toronto, I would say i love this one the most."}
{"text":"Awesome, first time trying a sushi burrito! :) Located near the Scotiabank movie theatre, it is in a good location in the Entertainment District. Also next to the Sweet Jesus ice-cream shop (haven't tried that yet).   We ordered their recommended Samurachi and Sensei. Full roll costs $11.99 and $12.99, respectively. Overall, we enjoyed the burrito but it is way over-priced... We also hoped they had more sashimi for the price we were paying. It was a fun experience though, but I likely wouldn't come back here again, I'd just visit a sushi joint and order actual rolls if I had sushi cravings."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the fish poke bowl as there's just too many weird toppings that I don't prefer in my bowl. Almost like it's trying too hard to stand out from all the other poke bowls in Toronto. This makes odd flavours stick out in ways that it shouldn't. However, I will give 2 thumbs up for the purple rice as that is much healthier than the usual white or even brown.   I will say that their sushi burrito is much better and is way more simple with the usual toppings. This makes the sushi burrito taste way better as flavours are well blended. Got the Samurachi which I would recommend and order again."}
{"text":"SU&BU was the first place that I tried a sushi burrito. I got the Gringo burrito and although tasty it was a bit hard and messy to eat.  SU&BU was also the first place that I tried a Poke Bowl. Why wasn't this a thing earlier?! (It probably was, I was just never aware - excuse my ignorance for a moment.) I'm not a huge fan of raw fish, mainly because of the texture, but with all the toppings, you barely even notice it. The bowl is just delicious. One thing I will do from now on is order a side of taro chips to accompany the bowl (the 3-4 chips they include just ain't enough!). Omnomnom."}
{"text":"The portions not worth the $$, moderate at best. Tuna wasnt fresh and fruits overpowered all other flavours."}
{"text":"I was pretty satisfied with the food here. It's a cool joint, attached to a Presotea and a Sweet Jesus. The sushi burrito is quite good. I had the Gringo's Delight, my friend the burger. The food is extremely filling and the staff efficient. However my friend noted that the salmon was not that fresh.   Overall, good place for some quick filling eats but not the highest quality you can get in Toronto."}
{"text":"I had the sushi burger and it was thoroughly enjoyable, was sad when I got to the last bite lol. It's quite saucy and more flavourful than the sushi burrito which my friend ordered. The other half of the shop is a prestotea, so if you want a slushie or bubble tea to go with your food, it's quite convenient."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood and revisited SU&BU after an invitation from the owner.   The Sensei burrito was great. Salmon, tuna, shrimp tempura, surimi crab, avocado, lettuce, cucumber, carrote, sweet chlli and SU&BU Sauce are a delicious combination! I adore the creaminess of avocado juxtaposed with crisp shrimp tempura!  Everything tasted fresh!   I will definitely visit  SU&BU again if I am in the area!"}
{"text":"We ordered half size burritos and they were delicious! The portion sizes were huge pretty  big as well even for half-size and we were satisfied. The fish was fresh, and the wait wasn't long. I really have no complaints about this place. I'd like to try their bowls next time."}
{"text":"Food: I was highly skeptical when sushi burritos first came to Toronto; it sounds like a very unlikely combo... But I have to say that Su&Bu has converted me! I had the Loco Coco sushi burrito and it was delicious! There was an interesting balance of sweet (mango) with salty (seaweed salad) and a surprising crunch from the Su&Bu chips. It also felt like a healthier and lighter option to regular sushi rolls with the fresh salad. I also love that they offer half-sizes - perfect for a light lunch or snack.  Service & atmosphere: Definitely feels more like a fast food place, which aligns with their price point. Plenty of daylight with the windows though so very enjoyable for a quick stop. The service is super friendly and informative too! (they warned me that the Zen burrito isn't fully vegetarian because of the fish oil in the kimchi - kudos because most places overlook that)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had the tofu poke which I enjoyed a lot.  They also have sushi burritos that you can try as well.    I would come to get my health fix for sure."}
{"text":"Protip - do not come into Su & Bu on an empty stomach because by the time you finish reading the ingredients list of what's included in a poke bowl, you will be STARVING. Seriously! The list is THAT long. Off the top of my head, there's dragon fruit, mango, avocado, seaweed salad, furikake, sesame seeds, taro chips, kale, cucumber, salmon, tuna, purple lettuce... like holy cow! The inclusion of dragon fruit already blew my mind.  The amount of variety in the poke bowl is both a blessing and curse. It's cool that there's so many things happening with every bite... but every component doesn't really work well together. Especially when there are 48920438290 bits of everything, it's hard to distinguish what's what and whether it works or not.  The fish was pretty fresh PLUS they use a purple rice base!! (yea colorful rice!!!) The sauces are pretty unique too. The poke bowl I ordered was a mix of 2: fruity mango and savoury shoyu.  The portion sizes are also smaller than expected. If you were to use both hands to form a bowl, that would be the standard size of a poke bowl here. For the price point, I'm not sure if the portion sizes are that fair...  Su & Bu was definitely good, but because it was kind of strange and pricey, I probably won't come back that often. Definitely worth a try though!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite lunch places. The sushi burger is awesome (albeit very messy to eat), the poke nachos are filling (unlike Poke at competitors nearby that would be lucky to qualify as an appetizer), and the burritos taste great (and are more affordable than the almost $~20 ones sold at another competitor nearby). The only thing I wouldn't get again was the fish sticks (although the sauces that came with it were both amazing) as they were tiny and just didn't really work all that well."}
{"text":"Checked in for quick convenient dinner before Scotia Imax Theatre Movie. This place is only like 3 min. away from the theatre!!!  Ordered sushi burger($9.99 plus tax) with wasabi pea dust($1 extra). Deep-fried crispy purple rice buns were stuffed with Salmon & Crabmeat, sriracha & sesame aioli, avocado, seaweed salad and other good stuff. I enjoyed it very much. Crispy rice buns definitely added fun texture to the fresh burger. However Wasabi pea dust for $1 was unnecessary."}
{"text":"Good portion size. The burrito was great, salmon was fresh. Get the wasabi mayo to dip on the side. The sushi nachos were good also but very saucy."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, always packed. Best advice is to order on ritual. Earn points and enjoy a delicious sushi burrito!!   We ordered their fan favorite poke nacho bowl. Half a gringo burrito and the samurachi sushi burrito. Delicious."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with a friend as it was close by and I had heard lots about it .   I got a sushi burrito, half a sushi burrito actually. And while the ingredients were tasty - my avocado was brown almost black and when I asked the girl at the counter if they could simply not roll my burrito and have it deconstructed in the box she gave me a funny look and said \" no, just pick something from the menu \". This was irritating as IT WAS ON THE MENU - I just asked for a small modification.   The price in my opinion is more costly than I'm willing to spend. At $9 for Half a SuBu I could go to one of the many other poke places and get way more for my $$   Probably wouldn't come back unless there was nothing else around."}
{"text":"Pro tip: Order on Ritual app to skip the line as it does get crowded around 1230ish weekdays   Review of three offerings: OG bowl, salmon ponzu bowl and Samurachi burrito.   OG bowl with tuna and salmon.  This poke is definitely a recommend! The kale, masago, mango complement really well with the protein.  Bowl provided ample toppings for the amount of rice given.    Samurachi burrito with tuna and salmon.  I would not recommend as the nori wrap was moist/soggy when I had it.  This came as surprise as it was only about 10-15mins after burrito was made.  Salmon ponzu bowl. Decent bowl topped with arugula, beets and dragon fruit on top of quinoa.  Combination of ingredients is good particularly the use of arugula and beets.  Use of quinoa is healthy but not fully compatible in this bowl; purple or white rice would be better.  Place has limited seating; 4 tables or so.   Overall, 3.5 stars out of 5"}
{"text":"Got the gringo delight. It was fresh and actually bigger than I had expected it to be.   The ingredients in the burrito blended well together, but it fell flat for me at the end of my first half because of the shrimp tempura tail that was still attached. I don't know if they forgot to cut it off or if that's how they serve it but when I'm mid meal, last thing I want to do is pull a shrimp tail out of my mouth.   In the end it was good. Relatively inexpensive. Will probably try again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"goodfood i like that the owner added special sauses and etc. to the roll so that it does not simply taste like rolls in XL size. ingredients are well balanced. roll is tightly rolled so that it does not fall apart when i eat half way (like some other places i visited)...would not.recommen the bowl tho...very small and mango tastes weird within..."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if maybe they hold back a little bit when you order using the Ritual app's discount, but the Signature Poke was very disappointing. Poke is kind of one of my favorite things to eat right now and I've tried a number of options located around downtown Toronto. The bowl I was given yesterday is definitely my least favorite.  First, the portion size of the raw fish is kind of a joke. I think it had 3 pieces total (2 salmon 1 tuna) - far smaller than your typical cut too. It was kind of sad that they charge $13 for that. To be completely honest, I already had low expectations for what the portion size was going to be considering the area and the brand image. But even then I was still kind of surprised.  Second, the bowl is mostly low-cost fluff. What they skimped on the fish they certainly made up for with fruit, edamame, and kale. When ordering I thought the inclusion of this stuff was going to make a fresher option compared to the alternatives in the area, but they kind of completely took over the dish. I didn't want a salad with a few slivers of raw fish and a single scoop of rice, but that's what I got.  I'll admit it looked nice. I get how people would want to take a picture of it and post it on social media. But, in terms of actually consuming the bowl as a meal, I think it fell short. Don't get me wrong - it's not the only place that serves poke where you won't feel that you got your money's worth at the end of it - but this is the only place I've tried where I feel like I was played."}
{"text":"The sushi roll had too much lettuce and fell apart.  I have had better. I had the half salmon.  Not a lot of salmon but lots of veggies.  Will try the burger next time im around there"}
{"text":"I was so excited when SU&BU opened. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu. The sushi burger is my fave! The poke nachos are also great (although I can't eat the whole thing myself - a little too greasy for me). The burritos are decent. I'm not a fan of the poke bowls though. They're a little on the small side and there's fruit in it. I love my fruit but not in poke!  Bonus: Preso tea right next door!"}
