{"text":"Expensive Mexican food. Ingredients and technique were good but execution could be improved.   Ceviche verde Nice big chunks of fish  Pollo en Pippian Rojo The chicken was bland and the red sesame sauce/ancho chile didn't add much flavour, just spice. Could've used more salt (I usually don't need to add more salt to anything)"}
{"text":"We ordered everything on the menu except the beef tongue. No dish received a thumbs-down from any of the four diners in our group although I admit that we may have been indifferent about at least two. However, there were a few standouts which were unanimously acclaimed. Definitely get the Tostada de Tinga (chicken tostada). Best thing on the menu and it was flavourful, rich and spicy (but not too spicy). Next best, but still a close second, was the stuffed poblano pepper.  The ceviche and flank steak salad were also popular. Guacamole was simply prepared and fresh and natural tasting. Chips were perfect - thin and crisp and freshly fried.  The flourless chocolate cake was so deeply and densely chocolately and coated and lingered in your mouth and was the perfect balance of bitter-sweet. The Carlotta de Limon was creamy custard and delicate, thin, spongy layers with real natural lime flavour. Both were excellent. If i had to choose only one - I wouldn't!  Get both, as hat's the beauty of the sharing set up of this place.  One complaint was lack of hot sauce.  Also, this is not a style of cooking that will leave you feeling ill from an over-dose of heavy carbs, oil and cheese.  If that has been your impression of Mexican cuisine, you will find this place very refreshing!  I was torn between a 3 and a 4 but gave a 4 on the strength of the desserts (which can often be an after-thought at other places) and on the strength of the light, natural preparation and authentic flavours. Location is easily accessible by subway (St. Patrick's) and a short walk West and North from University and Dundas."}
{"text":"My new favourite Kensington lunch spot.  Lunch portions are small. The green tostado is best accompanied by the pinto bean soup or plaintain chips from the neighbouring Venezuelan station."}
{"text":"I've been anxiously waiting for this restaurant to open. Especially knowing how good the food was from their stall in Kensington. Got a table here tonight and EVERYTHING was delicious. The space is really nicely laid out with a bar area downstairs and more tables on the 2nd level. We had the soup to start and it was wonderful, a sign of things to come. Add to that an awesome stuffed poblano, meatballs (nice & spicy), a chicken dish and beef tongue stew (served chilled). Not a complaint at all. Very good Mexican food all around. We finished with the chocolate torte & rose petal ice cream - they worked really well together.  We'll be back for more. There were a few tasty looking plates that we simply have to try! This is a great new addition to the restaurant scene in Toronto!"}
{"text":"The Tinga Tostada and beef salad were excellent !!! If it were not for the ludicrous wait times this place would get 5 stars."}
{"text":"I love the punk-rock, ramshackle approach/environment of this guy's set-up and really like supporting this type of micro-business (and i do mean 'micro' - pretty remarkable what he can churn out  from within a space that's smaller than my bathroom).   After two visits here (both on weekends, waited a good 15-20 min each time), I shared the following items (pretty much the entire menu) and all were super-fresh and very tasty, but could use a good bump of heat for added nuance:  - tinga (chicken) tostada ($5.50) -  *verde (veggie) tostada ($5) - meatball sandwich ($7.50) - and pinto bean soup ($3.50)  *the verde was tasty but not as much as the chicken, so if you're a meat-eater....  A FEW FYI'S: - cash only - if you're there on the weekend, past 4pm. be prepared for some items to be 'sold out' - notably, the flank steak salad and meatball sandwich - this place is not without its charms, but if you're like me and like to share everything with your companion...these items are tricky to divvy up in the best of scenarios, let alone when you're relegated to standing due to no seating *and* you've got plastic cutlery. sharing gets real messy, which takes away from the taste experience, imo. - is it worth waiting *beyond* 20 min in a hot'n'crowded environment? i'd say, maybe once...but otherwise, life is short, and there are too many other (and quicker) good-eats options in kensington to bother to wait a second time, especially if you're hungry."}
{"text":"While the portions aren't large (at lunch - I hear dinner has larger portions), they are very, very, tasty. And everything is made to order - even the soup!  Since everything is made to order, you really do want to eat everything as soon as you can. Since there are maybe 5 seats in the entire place (3 sharing a table, 2 stools at the window), this can prove tricky when busy. If you're intent on take-out, bring your own containers (for now) - the soup was the only thing that has a container to go.  Green Tostada Guacamole laced with lime - just the way I like it - piled on a fresh tostada, with lightly marinated tomatoes and a slice of queso fresco cheese. Topped with guajillo chili and tomatillo salsa. A really delicious mixture of creamy and crunchy. I splashed some of the habanero sauce that was on offer beside the table, but it wasn't very hot and I thought the dish was better without it. It really took me away from the dreary rain.  Flank Steak Salad Great fresh flavours - lime, onion, vinegar, jalapeno, tomato, and shredded flank steak. Sided with tortilla chips (fried to order, apparently. I missed this part as I dorking away on my cell). I could have used more jalapeno for more kick, but it was a really beautifully crafted dish with awesome layers of flavour. I also somehow thought this was a sandwich.  Soup While you can take this out in a container, I highly recommend you don't. Served piping hot, the avocado will cook and become a bit bitter if you leave it in there too long. A really thick bean soup with lots of flavour topped with tostada strips that gives it some texture. Less my thing.  Lime Charolotte A lime tiramisu-like dessert topped with fresh lime zest and olive oil. This is a dense and creamy confection. Really nice, but I was so full, I had to save it for later.  So glad I went (read about it in NOW this morning!). Watching the chef make each dish was really interesting. The care he puts in really shows. Am looking forward to a future meal.  COLES NOTES: - Mexican soul food - Lime is a strong flavour throughout many dishes. - If you're looking for this place, it's in the back of a El Gordo's Fine Foods across from Jumbo Empanada. Outside, you'll see a bakery with churros on offer. I missed it on my first pass. - Dishes around around the $5-6 mark. Cash only. - Getting my food wasn't fast, but not ridiculously slow either. Just don't be in a rush, m'kay?  (photos and menu on the blog)"}
{"text":"This is a superb little spot with incredible, authentic food. The price point is exceptional for the quality of the plates. Service is warm, casual but attentive. My only caveat is that we were only given an hour to dine but that may have been our fault - in part because we added a 3rd seat last minute. This is a food lovers spot. Come prepared, don't dawdle. Order and eat well. Crafted cocktails are available. A cute bar downstairs sits adjacent to the kitchen with the dining room on the second floor. Seating is at a premium. If you want to be fawned over and can't read a menu this may not be your spot but if you are a gastronome and an adventurer this place will wow you."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday in gorgeous sunny weather, so my friend and I were seated on the patio area.   We ordered cocktails, the Sopa Tarasca, the Ceviche, and the Chicken Tinga Tostada (all to share).  On the flavour: the Sopa was a great tomato-bean puree that really brought out the flavours when warm, and although seemingly simple, had a great consistency and taste.  The Tostada was still crispy when I was at the end of slowly working my way through.  The chicken was brilliantly flavoured and packs quite the kick.  By far, I think the ceviche was the most \"average\" - nothing stood out to me about the flavour - it was just incredibly sour from the lime/lemon juices, but no \"interesting\" herbs, spices, or otherwise to elevate to the next level.  Service: Friendly and mostly decent, but getting the bill took awhile, water refill was inconsistent.  Ambiance: Cute interior decor, and great area for sitting outdoors in warm weather.  Price: I tend to agree with what a number of yelp reviewers have brought up - for the price you're paying for these tiny tapas dishes, the value is just not quite there for me.  My friend and I were \"OK\" after the meal, but even then, it was just not a lot of food, and I didn't feel like the fish in the ceviche, for example, was particularly high quality to warrant such a large premium.  I would have to think twice about going back, but the soup and chicken Tostada were my favourite."}
{"text":"This place is pretty gorgeous and the food is fantastic. My friend and I just stopped by this evening and were very fortunately squeezed in before a reservation (already, this place is popular in its first week, although, of course, it used to be a successful food stall in Kensington). We had the tostada de tinga, chile poblano, and infamous lime charlotte to share. The crispy tostado was piled high with delicious and spicy toppings, such as chorizo, peppers, and beans. Although it looked tiny, it was not light. I have a low spice tolerance, so I was sipping my water in between bites, sad that the water washed away all the delightful flavours I was enjoying while eating it. Delish. The poblano was stuffed with cold guac and some gooseberries that were a wonderfully sweet contrast to the spiciness of the rest of the dish (although I found the tostado de tinga much spicier). We ended the meal with the perfect dessert: the creamy, tangy, amazing lime charlotte. The dense little cube is sprinkled with lime zest and black salt, both powerful flavours, that were well-balanced with the sweet, creamy custard and drizzle of light olive oil on top. Amazing finish for a spicy meal.  The decor is really nice. I love the intense, dark turquoise wall paint and the bold mural in front of the building. The first floor is quite small but the bench seating is pretty interesting (thank goodness they thought of putting coat hooks under the tables. Not enough restaurants think of where people can hang up their stuff). Since the restaurant is pretty brand spanking new, the staff were really eager for feedback and, of course, very nice. Music was a bit too loud though.  I would definitely recommend this place as a date spot or for drinks, and next time, I would like to try the bean soup and one of the other desserts.  TL;DR  Food: 5/5 Decor/Atmosphere: 4.5/5 Service: 5/5"}
{"text":"Anyone who has an ounce of patience should definately go and try this place out. You'll be rewarded end to end - be it food, the way its prepared or the humbleness of the chef - Alejandri rocks !!  Definately try the bean soup - so hearty and there's something which Alejandri adds to the cup before he pours the soup which adds so much flavour to the soup.  I had the Tinga Tostadas and the bean soup and will definately be back for the Lime Charolette as I wanted to have chorrious. IMO this place should not be visited if your intention is to go talk with your friends - Visit this place when you want to go and 'taste' good mexican food.  I think Alejandri should open a place, increase the menu items keeping the quality and experience same."}
{"text":"4/5! Highly recommend this place. The food is spicy but very flavourful and authentic. Make sure you make reservations because this place is small and limited seating. Favourite dishes: tostada de tinga (pulled chicken and beans on fried round tortilla), poblano chile relleno (stuffed pepper) and the flank steak salad (others didn't like this but I thought it was the best cold salad)."}
{"text":"overall the flavors were very authentic.  the ceviche was tangy, the flank steak salad spicy and lengua (beef tongue) tender and tasty.  we also had the tostada chicken. we also tried all 3 desserts available; everything was not on the sweet side which we preferred.  the limon was tart, the chocolate cake with rose petal sorbet bitter and the hot chocolate drink was flavorful. however, the hot chocolate drink was espresso-sized compared to what you'd get at Soma Chocolatier for about the same price.  also, out of all that we ordered, the ceviche was the priciest one at $15.  but it was a very small serving as 1/3 of the small bowl was filled with the chips. i would go back if i crave for authentic mexican flavors again but i wouldn't order the ceviche or dessert again."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars  So first off, to find this place you need to go into Gordo's Fine Foods on Augusta. When you walk in you'll see a Mexican bakery in the front and then four mini food stations in the back. The one with the massive line is Agave Y Aguacate.  So flavour wise this place is a 5+. The tinga tostada I had was the perfect balance of smokey chipotle, tomatoes and onions, with none of the ingredients out-competing the others. The tostada itself was perfectly crispy and everything was topped off with some nice quesa fresca, pickled red onions, red and white sauce, and a cool slice of avocado.  The tostada was probably the best I've ever had in my life and the quality of \"Mexican soul food\" here rivals the stuff I've had in California.   The downsides are the line and lack of eating space although in some ways both actually add to the charm. Waiting in line for 15 minutes both builds anticipation and allows you to watch the labour of love Francisco Allejandri puts into every tostada, as he chops, mashes, and composes while listening to his IPOD in his chef coat.  Similarly, wolfing down the tostada (while not forgetting to breathe) in the alley right outside, somehow seems appropriate.  This is now a must-do in Kensington and is probably going to cut down on the amount of visits I do to El Trompo when I'm having a Mexican craving.   PS - shout-outs are merited to the Arepa station (I had a great one in line) and the bakery in the front (where I bought a top notch dulce de leche churro post-tostada)"}
{"text":"I was at Agave on Dec. 18th, our table was 4 people.  Our bill was $170 with no dessert or coffee.  I don't mind paying if the food is worth it but it wasn't.  I cook a lot and this was not worth the money. We asked the waitress about how many dishes to order, she suggested 7, we ordered 10 that included a charge for bread and taco chips. Let's talk about portion size, I understand the idea of tapas style but the portion sizes were very small and uninspired.   Another thing that bothered me were the stools we sat on, very uncomfortable.  Also, I ordered a mojito, which was ok, but I was never asked if I wanted another one.  My other table mate had a glass of wine and was never asked about a refill either.  My son and his girlfriend were still hungry at the end of the meal and went to McDonalds afterwards.  I won't be back until the chef ups his game.  I will list the dishes we had in another review.  The worst dish we had was Sopa de tortilla. It tasted like dishwater. If Anthony Bourdain thought this was good I will have to speak to him."}
{"text":"It's not a place for cheap eats for those who are expecting a stereotypical mexican taco/burrito place. The food is well made with thoughts into them. Not sloppy cheap Tuesday Taco deals.   Had the home made tortila chips, stuffed pepper with gauc, and the fryer chicken. All really well made. Flavour is interesting and well balanced. For example, the stuffed pepper was spicy, but there was some fruit sauce in it that counter the spice.   I would give it 4 stars, but made it 3 only because of the pricing and location. This place caters towards the young crowd with already exisiting money. Not a lot of people in Toronto, namely this neighbourhood, would spend $10+ a dish for tapas, especially when you need 2-3 to make the \"I'm starting to get full\" line. The food itself deserve the 4 stars because you can see and taste the effort, thoughts, and passion in it."}
{"text":"Let's just say I was a very happy person after dining at Agave last week. I've been waiting for what seemed like forever to taste Chef Francisco's food again, and he certainly did not disappoint. Every dish was delicious, full of flavours but refreshing at the same time. Cerviche Verde was one of the best I've had, and the Tostada de Tinga was spicy but so incredibly tasty. We also enjoyed the meatballs and the beef tongue dishes. To finish, we ordered the Carlota de Limon, which I immediately regret sharing after taking the first bite. :) I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!!"}
{"text":"I give it 3.5 stars really. I had the ceviche tostada and my husband had the beef tongue. The food was nummy. It loses points because it's a little expensive, considering the quantity of food. An inexpensive meal for those of you who can fit into the skinniest of jeans; an expensive snack for those of you who are actually hungry. I'll echo the sentiment on here that they're a little skimpy with the avocado. I do love that they're using sustainable seafood though."}
{"text":"Bravo!  After years of waiting, Agave y Aguacate officially opened its doors to their new digs at 35 Baldwin St. So for those of you who were fans of the former Kensington location, or watched Bourdain's Layover in Toronto, here's your chance to finally sink your teeth into the goods!  The menu boasts tiny plates meant for sharing. To start we had the Pinto Bean/Tomato soup with Ancho Chile and Queso Panela.  Get it. Trust me. It is so good.   The smokiness from the Ancho Chile really elevated the Tomato Base adding depth and richness. The cubes of Queso Panela immersed in the soup were warm and squishy, adding the right amount of salinity and creaminess to balance the rest of the components. What I'm really trying to say is, get it, it's good :D  The Chile Poblano Relleno stuffed with Guacamole, Pineapple, and Gooseberries had our table singing. This was spot on with just the right amount of heat emerging from the pepper and zippy zing from lime. Loved it!  Another favourite was the Tostada de Tinga. If I were you, I wouldn't share this item because a) It's hard to share and b) It's really yummy, so you won't want to share.   My friend had the Flank Steak Salad and really enjoyed it. I had the Pollo en Pipian Rojo. I felt like it could use a tad more seasoning. With a little bit of reworking, I can see this being a good one.  And of course, it is impossible to step away from a Mexican meal without Dulce, right? So please allow me to  indulge :) The 70% Dark Hot Chocolate with Mexican Spices was liquid gold. Imagine drinking chocolatey velvet and you'll get the idea. A must for any chocolate lover.  I was particularly smitten by the Carlota de Limon. It is a dish of layered Mexican Biscuits with Lime Curd that will have your fingers and toes tingling with joy. I love Key Lime and this totally hit the ball out of the park.   Overall, this was a great meal. I am so happy to see authentic Mexican dishes, as they are prepared and eaten in Mexico, introduced to the culinary diaspora of Toronto. Kudos Agave Y Aguacate!"}
{"text":"Green Tostada, amazing.   Fresh guacamole, quesa fresca, tomato, sauce. All made to order.  All made with love, and care, and one order at a time. Perfectly seasoned. Portions are on the smaller side, so get an empanada from the booth across from Agave to tide you over. Have some patience, it will be rewarded.   Based on comments from the other reviewers, I think the prices may have increased slightly. The Green Tostada was $7, The Tinga $6.75  Makeshift patio out back to eat.  Excellent."}
{"text":"I read great reviews about this restaurant and very excited to go there. The food was different, but they were over-priced for what they were.  The portions are too small. My server was too eager, pushy and couldn't stop pouring water-- very disruptive. The servers running up and down stairs and it was too loud. I did not like the ambiance at all of this restaurant.  I was disappointed to be honest. If I were to say strictly about food- it is an above average restaurant, but as a whole- not worth the money. Lots to improve."}
{"text":"Food is 5 stars. But, it is abit expensive  for a snack food. And, it is slowwww.....If you are in a hurry, don't bother coming here. Just grab a churros (it's delicious) from the next stall.   There is a patio in the back."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Mexican food I've ever had.  It is tough to get in so book your resos far in advance. We had the green ceviche, the tongue stew and the tostada. The tostada was really good and would probably come back just for another taste of this.   The portions are on small side and the prices on the high side. The cocktails are quite strong. I really enjoyed the margarita  For dessert we had the chocolate torta which was rich and and almost too good to share =p The service was good, attentive but not intrusive. Can't wait to go back and have a a cold margarita at their patio"}
{"text":"We were on the hunt for cheap tacos on a Thursday night. We decided to check out Chef Alejandri's new Baldwin village location of Agave Y Aguacate -- which is the complete opposite of cheap tacos.   No tacos, instead there was a creative selection of Mexician inspired tapas plates.  The place was pretty busy on a very cold night and we were seated in the downstairs  bar area.  If you are seated on the first floor, the seating is a bench against the wall.  Eating and drinking at a 45 degree angle is completely awkward and uncomfortable.   I would ask to be seated at a real table next time.  We ordered three items to start.  The Ceviche Verde ($13) was fish cured in lime juice with habanero and avocado. The flavours were good...but it was a lot more avocado than fish.  Our second dish was the Pollo en Pipian Rojo ($11). It was chicken dish with a red sesame sauce topped with almonds. This dish was a bit of a disappointment... The sauce was bland and the dish was not very memorable.  The best item of the evening was the Tostada de Tinga ($9). The pulled chicken and chorizo was moist and saucy.   Avocado and refried beans were great for texture.   The sauce was definitely spicy.  Loved this dish!  As for cocktails, I ordered the Paloma ($12).  Tromba, Steigl, and Grapefruit is a refreshing, citrusy, and awesome combination.  Overall, the food was good, but we were still hungry after. I feel like I'd have to spend a lot more to be full. However, I'll be back from some cocktails and maybe another round of Tostadas!"}
{"text":"They have good food but the mexican waiter upstairs and the bus boy SUCK. Food took forever, 45 minute wait between small tapas that shouldn't take as long as it did. No explanations as to why the food took forever, we were ignored. Looking around, everyone was feeling the same way with the awkward looks between the tables. The waiter even spilled pop on my friend and didn't apologive. THEN, he added a dish that we did not order. Shady, horrible service, will not go back."}
{"text":"the meaning of Agave Y Aguacate in Portuguese is \"Ages and Ages\".  Since the dawn of time, the eccentric chef is making tostada. The same tostada.  Expect a line of Now readers, too blind to open an Eye for other great latin food in the exact same joint. The snacks are delicious but 20 minutes for a sandwich ? Hijo de Puta !  Nevertheless - this \"hole in the hole in the wall\"  is, hands and agaves down - one of the best $4 lunches in the GTA."}
{"text":"The dynamics of this latin 'food court' are incredible! A casual weekend shopping trip to the market would not be complete without a trip here to grab, at the very least, a churro (with everything!) and check out the action toward the rear of the space. I upped a pic of the cool skeleton woman 'scarecrow' that greets you as you enter the bakery at the front and it is quite a shock But the kiosks at the back are what intrigue me most. The taco stand on the left had such a compelling menu that I grabbed a pic of that too. Carne asada (steak) as well as beef cheeks and cactus, and... well check out the pic and zoom in on the selections, fantastic! Ask about their home made salsa sauces for your taco. I tried them all, quite delicious, and the habanero is hot and rich like you would expect, yummmmy. And, if that's not enough, at the rear of the space there is now a west Indian stand selling jerk chicken. They have some serious gear for cooking back there, and told me that the grilling is done outside. It all was a bit much to take in for me all at once, so yes, another visit is coming up, of course! 4 stars as the place could be cleaned up and organized a bit."}
{"text":"The tostada was good. Really good. The prices and serving sizes were not. I ordered a flank steak salad and a Green Tostada. The tostada was delightful, the steak salad was alright, but it didn't blow me away. Everything was done fresh, right in front of me, it's true, but the steak salad seemed to be nothing more than a small potion of steak with three cilantro leaves thrown in, and a thin slice of avocado. Not bad by any means, but nothing special.  No line up when I arrived at 1:30pm, however this may have been because it was one of the HOTTEST DAYS in Toronto, and no one besides me was silly enough to leave their air conditioning spaces. That being said, despite the lack of a line, I was still perturbed at how small the portion sizes of each dish were and their cost. Each item on it's own was too small for a lunch, so At $7 each my $14 lunch was tasty, but to be honest, there are lots of other great, fresh, tasty lunch options in Kensington for under $10.  Don' t know that I will be back. (This is very disappointing for me, as I had been looking forward to going here for a while!)"}
{"text":"I went into Agave Y Aguacate expecting to be blown away. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I found myself very disappointed. I will go into great detail, because I think the chef is great. Perhaps he worked it hard for the few months after the opening and left someone else in charge of the kitchen on less busy nights. Suffice it to say I was really shocked at how clumsy the food was.  We ordered a few cocktails ($12 for each) and they were both good. I had the El Diablo, which had Ginger and Cassis and was refreshing and a little bit spicy. But they took forever to bring them! We sat, ordered our food and watched a table beside us (who arrived after us) get their cocktails AND first course, before we had our drinks.  Perhaps the bartender forgot the order or something. All in all the service was good, though.  After our first course arrived, we ordered a bottle of Cava, which was nice, but the server had to keep it in a cooler by the POS system. The tables were so small that she said she couldn't fit the cooler plus the food on the table.   I have a new rule: If you can't fit the bottle on the the table, you shouldn't be selling it... Profit margin vs. real estate.    The tostada (as others have mentioned), was the stand out dish. The flavours of the smoky chipotle and chorizo were nicely balanced by the chicken. Often times with a tostada, it can be hard to cut through the toppings and get a bite of the tostada along with them. Perfect bites were achieved with this one.  The flank steak salad was nicely done with a good balance of acidity. But, like most of the items here, it was very small. I's say there was maybe 1 oz. of pulled steak in the whole order.  Meatballs (albondigas) were described as pork and beef. A few of them were almost raw on the inside. Now, I'll eat my beef blue, but ground pork worries me a little more if it's not at least cooked medium. The beans underneath were ok, but the presentation was lacklustre.  Poblano stuffed with guacamole. I really feel like the guacamole would have been better with the chips that came with the flank steak. Call me boring and traditional, but I think the poblanos needed a different texture on the inside such as some ground meat or cheese. The soft pepper wasn't the right vessel and although it was tasty, the combination left me cold.  Tongue Stew- Lengua. Well spiced and the tongue was tender, but again, the presentation was really just diced tongue meat stewed in gravy.   Fryer chicken with softened almonds appeared in almost the identical mole as they meatballs and was tasty, but there was no hint of the almonds in the dish and it all seemed rushed and unimpressive.  Zucchini had to be the face palm of the evening. The canela was in shards that you had to chew along with the delicate diced vegetable and crema. I could have justified a light dusting of it, but coupled with the dim lighting that made it hard to pick though any of the food,  this was like chewing on camphorated tree bark!  The spice completely overruled the vegetable and I'm still bewildered as to how this dish was thought up. I'm actually almost crying as I write this as I really had high hopes for this restaurant and just feel that this dish was full- on bad.  In all, I found that although each item was flavourful, but the tastes were not varied enough or as enticing as described in the opening reviews. Even the heaviest food I've had in Mexico has a contrasting balance of freshness to it. I found that bright tone to be very lacking in this meal, with the exception of the Lime Charlotte for dessert. A classic bang-on balance of sweet, salty and sour, this lovely morsel (and it was a morsel), was really a smooth and refreshing bite of heaven.  Value is hard to come by here. If you like to drink, your bill will be close to $200 for 2 ppl with tax and a good tip.   Personally, I think that Agave Y Aguacate does some decent food, but the menu is poorly constructed. There are no quick nibbles to begin with and the tapas idea for Mexican food really doesn't work. I want to say that it could, but so many of the items feel like heavy mains that just aren't big enough or unbalanced without freshness variety.  I'm not sure what happened as Chef Alejandri is a talented man. Did some monkeys break in and commandeer the kitchen tonight?"}
{"text":"What a great change from the taco influx just about everywhere in the city.  I had high expectations for Agave given the Anthony Bourdain endorsement, and they were met!  The idea is tapas/sharing style plates.  We had the tostada, ceviche and the mexican stew.  The tostada was recommended by our waiter and was amazing.  You'll should order one for yourself though.  This was probably the best part of our meal.  Ceviche came with tortilla chips and was quite tart - just like real ceviche should be! The stew is beef tongue.  This may not be for anyone, but the tongue was very tender, almost melting in my mouth.  We tried two of the cocktails, the margarita and one that had gingerbeer in it.  I'm a big fan of ginger beer in cocktails, and it was quite boozy.  We also indulged in dessert.  You cannot go wrong with the spiced chocolate torta with the sorbet.  It's a dark chocolate and extremely decadent.  We also had the lemon carlota, but the torta is the real winner.  The restaurant is very small.  I'd try to sit upstairs.  If you're sitting downstairs be prepared to likely be bumped around a bit as it's quite narrow and wait staff are going back and forth.  It is also quite hard to get a reservation.  Service however, was good.  I rarely return to restaurants repeatedly, but I am already planning to go back. Best Mexican in the city so far."}
{"text":"SUPERB! Simple food cooked fresh full of flavour and taste. The location looks a little shabby, but that adds to the experience, and the actual stall seems to be clean and professionally kept. We tried four different dishes and they were all good but the ceviche needs a special mention, as it was sooooo tasty! A Kensington market gem."}
{"text":"Decided to come to Agave y Aguacate as we were downtown and I have always wanted to try it out based on the Yelp buzz it had gotten in recent months.  I tried the Tinga Tostada ($6.75) which was made with beans, tomato, avocado and chicken.  I guess inflation has finally found its way to this joint?  I agree with Jennifer K that they could stand to be a bit more generous with their avocado (I got one tiny slice of it).  Service is at a snail's pace, although you are getting freshly prepared food.    There is seating if you walk out to the back. However, if it is a hot summer's day, be warned, you will be sweating buckets as it is a makeshift seating area with no shade of any kind!    I can now say I've tried it - but I don't think I'll go out of my way to come back for a Tostada.  In my opinion it was nothing special.  The difference is that it is made to order with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I haven't told many this, but on my deathbed my last meal would be a Mexican schmorgasboard fiesta. I don't think there is any other cuisine out there that marries some of my favorite flavors. I like it all. Every dish from Americana to Traditional Mexican fare would be mine to have: A taco stand with all my favorite fillings, an endless plate of shrimp and baja fish, ceviche, a never ending bowl of guacamole, tostada's, home made fajita and corn chips, empanadas, chalupa's chimichanga's, fajita's, taquito's, mole, mole, mole, tamale's, burrito's and of course churro's.  Is your mouth watering yet? It's almost lunchtime and there's no good Mexican options in the area, which brings me to my point.  AGAVE Y AGUACATE...silence. This gem deserves a moment of silence for finally bringing the standard for Mexican food to Toronto. Most of the old famous (Dos Amigos, Chimichanga, El Trompo) have been sloppy and lost their zest for Mexican cooking. What does Agave Y Aguacate have that the others lack - Francisco Alejandri. Francisco is all about passion and cooking with his heart. I've had the pleasure of watching him prepare my food. His process and focus is absolutely beautiful to witness. His mantra says it all - Mexican soul food. This is what Agave is all about. Flavors which leave you talking for days and pining for.  Check out his blog, he shells out some secrets to some of his favorite dishes he prepares.   I ordered...  TOSTADA VERDE/GREEN TOSTADA(central mexico style guacamole, tomatoes, sheep's milk pecorino cheese, crema fresca and guajillo sauce)  CAMARONES ROJOS/ RED SHRIMPS(shrimps with red escabeche on a slice of avocado with a drizzle of crema fresca and topped with crushed peanuts)  Francisco understands balance in his dishes for both the flavor and presentation. His guacamole is genius and he sources the best avocados I have ever seen. I was tempted to put some salt on my green tostada but I have recently inherited an unusual need for too much salt. Everything is made to order so be patient. He sources all of his ingredients locally from the nearby Mexican specialty and produce stores. The only issue I faced was trying to figure out how to tackle my first bite and avoid getting it all over my shirt.   The location is a bit bizarre. Tucked inside of a Mexican to go counter, you'll find Agave in the back squeezed between another Mexican food stand and a specialty lemonade stand. There's no seating and it gets incredibly hot in there on a packed day in the summer, but few restaurants allow you into their kitchen to see their master chef at work. You must take a visit to Agave and bring a friend so you can try everything."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening. Hidden inside a complex of different to-go counters, you'll find Agave Y Aguacate. Not to be confused with the empanadas stand to the right, their menu is a few items and the descriptions on a paper.   The portions are small but filling , leaving lots of room for dessert, plantains and churros.   We got the Chicken Mole (2pcs) $11 it was good but small. I also got the Anita Tostada. It was extremely tasty but still on the pricey side $10 for a small plate.   For dessert we got the Lime Charlotte based on all the reviews below. Omg it was extremely tasty. All these different flavors in one spoonful.   What's great is the all natural and authentic foods. Worth a try but couldn't come here everyday.   I would get maybe three dishes plus dessert for two people but where do you eat all this ???? We were lucky it was a nice day and we ate in the parking lots back patio."}
{"text":"Like many other Yelpers we were eagerly awaiting the resto's reopening on Baldwin. We tried about six different offerings -- flank steak salad, tostada, ceviche, stuffed poblano -- plus the soup and dessert. Everything was excellent, especially the guanajuato meatballs, which had an extremely tasty mole-like sauce. Our waitress was knowledgable and attentive and everything ran smoothly--especially for a new place.  My only quibble was the margaritas. Although quite tasty, they were served in very small glasses (perhaps 3 oz.), which lasted 3 sips and didn't quite merit their 12$ price tag.  All in all, though, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very average Mexican food. Dishes are between $11-15, which isn't crazy but it is slightly pricey for these types of tapas.  I tried Agave Y Aguacate when the chef had a little stand in Kensington Market. A lot of these dishes were between $5-7 then. and doubling the price is a big factor.  The guacamole-filled poblano is interesting and has a cool presentation, stuffed inside the big pepper, but the guacamole lacked salt and a topping of carrots was bizarre. Still, guacamole was very fresh.  The fryer chicken in the red sauce was alright; lacked pop. No real burst of any type of flavor. Not sure why it comes with crostini.   Ceviche was a bit bizarre too. Large chunks of cod with tons of onion. Not bad, not great either.   Lastly, we had the shredded flank steak. This was probably the best dish. Tasted slightly under-seasoned but was very fresh and balanced with some red onion, coriander and red pepper.   Overall, it's not a place I'd really recommend."}
{"text":"Kensington Market is one of my happy places. Walking around there, even on a winter's day is like going into sensory overload. I always make sure to carry some extra shopping totes with me when I head through the streets. What can I say, I'm just a weakling when you put me on to these streets. Meat, cheese, fish, spices, baked goods and then your nose takes over.   Smell is such a powerful trigger. As I walk past Pancho's Bakery my snozz gets a scent full of cooking Churros. It is just too much for me and I'm ready to succumb to those evil fried tubes of pastry goodness but the throngs of people squeezing into the doors puts me off. I manage to just get inside the entrance of Pancho's and I'm beginning to feel the onset of claustrophobia. The heaviness of the wafting scents of frying oil only adds to the sensation of not being able to get my breath. I look up and I notice the stairs leading up to a small upper level that looks far less populated. Squeezing through the crowd I work my way up the stairs only to discover that there are other small food booths/destinations inside of Pancho's Bakery. This setting of a small business inside of another small business is very much of what you can expect to find in an authentic central America street food setting. You'll find small, one man food booths, each person selling their specialty foods, often a special family recipe. Something tells me I'm going to be grateful for the perseverance of pushing through the hoards of the Churro chuffing mob.   Meet Francisco \"Paco\" Alejandri. His booth is called Agave Y Agucate (which means Agave & Avocado). As it turns out our paths have crossed over at the Drake at 86'D Mondays. We had sat beside each other during a guacamole smack down, devouring Chicharrones together along with a little mountains of avocado goodness. Francisco has opened up his own petite table in Pancho's. It is difficult not to notice his space up there because he has muraled the wall behind him and it's an explosion of a gorgeous tangerine colour. His cooking station is spotless, with small mortal & pistol bowls, a couple of special tabletop burners, cutting boards, a small deep fryer and little piles of fresh uncut tomatoes, avocados, jalapenos, fresh greens & herbs. His chalkboard menu is tiny. There are 5 items on it. Francisco makes one of my most fave Mexican indulgences, Tinga Tostadas, which is a version of a Mexican pulled pork on a tostada piled with array of fresh toppings. My daughter and I order a Tinga Tostada, a Verde Tostada.   I'm mystified by the presence of a big glass beverage dispenser. I ask Francisco about it and he tells me it is Hibiscus water. My eyes open wide. I have never had Hibiscus water but I was drawn to it by the brilliant ruby colour. Being a gardener I can appreciate the exotic beauty of the Hibiscus flowers. They are pretty and delicate, somewhat similar to Hollyhocks. We order a glass and I stand there watching as Francisco begins making our order and I slowly, somewhat cautiously take a sip. The drink was not chilled which means the flavors will flow through my palate even quicker. It was sweet but not cloying or perfumy. Can you call a beverage delicate? It didn't have any astringency like you'd find in lemonade or any tannin after taste like ice tea. I couldn't put my finger on the flavour except to say I'm calling Francisco to ask him if I could buy a couple of litres of it. Hibiscus water could be the base of a really beautiful exotic summertime cocktail Just like me to be thinking about what booze I could mix this up with!   It was a pleasure watching Francisco lovingly prepare these tostadas. It is a labour of love. None of the veggies or toppings, other than the pork and the onions, which seem to be marinated in something that has softened them, has been pre-chopped. So I watch as Francisco cuts open a fresh avocado and carefully slices out three pieces for topping. The first layer of the tostada has fried black beans, he ladles a generous helping of the pork mixture and then he just continues to pile, topping after topping. He chops fresh jalapenos, he chops up fresh tomatoes. I am watching food architecture. That cream that is last splash on the very top, isn't your standard sour cream, there is something very different about it. This tostada has colour, texture, crunch, smoothness, heat, sweet and is filled with true TLC.   The Verde Tostada is perfect for the vegetarians in the crowd. Francisco pulps the fresh avocado mixture, tops that with a slab of Queso Fresco and what I think is a roasted tomatillo salsa of some sort. We plunk ourselves on one of six chairs available in the whole place and eat our food watching the world of Kensington Market pass by the windows.   For all this freshly made goodness and a couple of glasses of Hibiscus Water the price tag is $12.50. La Vida es Buena (life is good). We'll be back. Check out the pics!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets!!!! Lovely ambiance and decor and the food is delish!!!! Can't wait to go back on my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"I was visiting from NY And can easily say the food was far superior to any of the high end Mexicans in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Highlights were the Ceviche, the stuffed pepper and believe it or not, the chocolate cake!!"}
{"text":"Agave is the newest restaurant to open on Baldwin, a street very well known for its many wonderful restaurants. I have lunch on Baldwin once a week, but I've walked past this place many times without even noticing it. It is currently only open for dinner, but the waitress assured me that will likely change soon. This is a tapas restaurant; you order multiple small dishes and share them. We ordered Chili Poblano Relleno, Chicken Tinga Tostada, a meatball dish for which the name escapes me, and Chicken Rojas. All of the dishes were delicious. I would suggest ordering your own chicken tostada. It is so out-of-this-world, you will not want to share.  In fact, I might have been heard to state, \"It's like a party in my mouth and everyone's invited!\" But be warned, it is not for the feint of heart. If you can't handle spicy, this delectable dish is not for you. My margarita was excellent, but at $12, it was either wildly overpriced or wildly undersized. Perhaps both.  That was kind of the theme of the night. Everything was delicious, but small and expensive. You will definitely enjoy your meal, but be prepared to drop a fair amount of coin."}
{"text":"I have to admit this is my first time going to a Mexican restaurant that didn't do tacos or chips/salsa.  Overall, the food is pretty good.  The tostado was a flavor bomb and hit every tastebud in one bite - but both of us got this strange salty undertow, otherwise it would have been a flawless dish.  I would recommend it.  My brother and I *love* beef tongue, so the lengua was a must.  It was stewed in mole sauce and very tender.  I liked it, but far from the best I've had.  The surprising dish was the meatball dish.  Very tasty and something I would eat again... and again... and again.  My favourite dish of the three.  The dishes are for sharing but are pretty small and are about $9 - $12 each and it can be pretty pricey considering you need about 2 - 3 dishes per person.  The two of us ordered 3 plates and decided to bounce out because nothing else look too appealing and my brother (who is a tourist in the city) wanted to save his stomach for another place.  He wanted to check Agave Y Aguacate out due to the Bourdain recommendation on The Layover.  We were seated downstairs and at table facing the bar.  Noticed another Yelper liked the odd seats (you and your dining partner seat on a high bench, with a table between you) for the intimacy, but it just made talking awkward as the natural tendency is to face in the parallel direction.  It might be good for an intimate date, but as my brother and I didn't want to rub knees under the table, you twist your body to face each other as your legs dangle in the walkway.  Might have liked it more if the seats were better -- but I did like the little shelf above the table to keep things off the table.  I think this was built specifically with phones in mind.  Overall, pretty good but think there are better places in the city at ~$30/head."}
{"text":"4.5 STARS  What a great day in Kensington to be munching on Mexican food.  We first stopped by here on Pedestrian Sunday.  You know a place is bumping when there's a huge line-up and many people walking out of the store and happily munching away food outside.  Agave y Agucate is a very tiny little store; with a bakery in the front and a cramped little space in the back.  There's only one chef that worked there - and he was working his butt off.  The line up there was huge, and many people were waiting there for the deliciousness that was going to come their way.  My friends and I all ordered the tingo tostada; the tostada (basically a fried/toasted tortilla) with fried beans, pulled chicken, avocado, onions and Mexican crema.  You can see it that he takes him time and effort into every single tostada.    Although service was a bit slow, and the place was a bit cramped - the food was delicious.  A great place to grab a little snack on a sunny stroll in Kensington (however, you might want to be careful and avoid dropping this on your clothes)."}
{"text":"Food: had the lengua, ceviche and albondigas. The lengua was tender, earthy and gamey, the ceviche was bright, tart and spiced w/ heat, and mint although it could've used more mint. The albondigas was the fave. Rich, heavy, warm w/ chipotles, enriched w/ avocado and cut through w/ pickled red onions. This dish was the best balanced of the three tried.  Interior: warm, dark, seats aren't made for lingering.   Value: for the price, considering it's small plates meant for sharing, they could throw in a couple more spoonfuls. The meatball dish is excellent, but it works out to $3/ball, so it better be."}
{"text":"Like many others, I have been patiently waiting for Chef Alejandri to open a new restaurant since his stall closed a couple summers ago.  I booked a table on the only the 2nd day of their soft opening. While I expected the food to be amazing (and it was!), I was not expecting such a wonderful, polished  serving experience on only the 2nd day. The wait staff were friendly, charming and attentive, the manager/co-owner was mingling with guests ensuring we were comfortable and enjoying ourselves. It was fantastic!  Back to the food. It was just as good as I remember from the Kensington location!  We started with the stuffed poblano pepper. The spice level with the sweetness from the added pineapple was an excellent combination. Also, they make the best guacamole I have ever had.  We followed that with the Tostada de Tinga, the meatballs and a side of zucchini. All 3 dishes were spot on delicious.  We also had all 3 desserts! The dark chocolate was incredibly decadent, the chocolate torte and rose petal ice cream were a perfect pariing and the Carlota de Limon has a beautiful citrus custard creaminess.  Agave is probably my new favourite restaurant in Toronto. I have already planned out 4 more visits with friends. I may have an addiction to deal with..."}
{"text":"On the whole, this place was a complete miss. I am giving two stars because the sangria, tortas, and zucchini were good, but everything else failed to impress. The prices are way too high and the portions are way too small. Beer is also quite expensive ($8 for a bottle), and the server was strangely authoritative in his description of the menu, telling us exactly how many dishes to order from each section. I guess we have yet another pretentious Mexican joint to add to the roster here in Toronto. Avoid this if you like feeling good about the money you've spent on dinner!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner at around 9pm on a Wednesday night and they happened to be shooting a TV show. The food took a while to get out, but the waiters kept our glasses full and the food was fantastic - best Mexican food I've eaten in my life.  The most notable dish for me was the beef tongue stew. I didn't know beef tongue could become so tender, I could've sworn it was just fat... delicious.  Also worth mentioning is their chicken tostada. Whatever they put in there, it came together really well - it was like tasting something new and awesome for the first time ever.  The establishment is pretty small and gets really busy, so plan accordingly. They take reservations :)"}
{"text":"Kinda smallish dish for what you get. I always thought this place was a restaurant. Turns out it is a food stall. The food was pretty tasty but $20 in Kensington Market I expect more than just 2 small take away containers. Likely won't be heading back soon."}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot from this restaurant considering I had heard so much about it. I booked in advance for a large table for my birthday dinner.  Let's start with the service - terrible. A flustered waitress, who was not particularly helpful. Orders were messed up completely.  Dishes were small, lacklustre and expensive. Not worth the hype"}
{"text":"4.5 Stars  VIBE  Finally, a bricks and mortar location! I LOVE LOVE LOVE the seating downstairs where you sit side by side on a bench and the table is in the middle. I've never seen seating like this in Toronto and it's perfect for date night (especially if the date is going well and if not, yikes! Eat fast). There's nothing more I hate than being ten feet away from your dinner companion at a table feeling interviewey. Thank you for making eating intimate again, whoever the designer of those bench/table combos are. There's an upstairs too but I like downstairs so get there early if you can. It books up fast because it's a small restaurant.  Bonus points for being in Baldwin Village and the lovely staff.   WE ATE/DRANK Solid margaritas here.  The sope - so, so good. Especially in the winter.  The chicken tinga tostada - bestill my heart. Wish we got another one of these.  Flank steak salad - good but not my favourite. As above, got a second tinga tostada.  Flourless chocolate cake - I wanted chocolate and this did not disappoint but next time I'm getting the liquid chocolate. Limone over this cake but it was fun to share both. Carlote de limone - my dining companion ate this up. Has a really nice zest to it that left a lasting impression on the meal, overall. Plus, it's not huge!   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  I love Francisco Alejandri's food so much that I went into the kitchen to thank him. Too bad he's not out in the open. I would have given him a hug but he might have thought I was creepy and I guess that's not sanitary, anyway. I'm so glad he has a restaurant and I hope he continues to remain a fixture on Toronto's food scene and especially the Mexican restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Right in the heart of Kensington Market on Agusta and in the back of El Gordo Fine Foods/Pancho's Bakery lies one of the best Mexican food \"secrets\" in the city.  Francisco used to cook at Torito when it was wicked (now, I'm not sure what it's like. I don't think the quality at Torito is that great anymore). Anyways, he cooks from the heart and is such a character! Oh, and bring cash only kids.   VIBE  Look for the very colourful mural in the back of Pancho's bakery. It's like when you hit the pinata and all of the candy comes out except it's Mexican food. And it's not your typical tacos/guacamole. Francisco is cooking up the real deal right in front of you.  And don't expect to have a fancy seat. You've got a plastic chair with one table in the back or the floor. Make use of it. Lots of Spanish being spoken. It's pretty cool.  I ATE The tostada Ana - a crispy open tortilla filled with avocado, chorizo and black bean paste, queso fresco (fresh cheese --which doesn't really have a lot of flavour) and guajillo sauce which gives the meat a bit of kick. Yowza! It's going to be awkward eating it, I have to admit. Everything is super fresh though and Francisco walks you through the ingredients. It's a great way to have a conversation. The menu changes on the regular.   The whole menu looks lovely though and nothing is over $11.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  If you want a Toronto experience, this one is it. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Flavor ,flavor and more flavor. I have tried 5 items from the menu and there all fantastic and I can't wait to wait to try the rest. All dishes are fresh and health. Some of the best guacamole I have ever had."}
{"text":"I had read so much about Agave Y Aguacate, and being a Mexican food lover, I was eager to try these dishes. I e-mailed the owner of the restaurant requesting a reservation for 10 people (grew to 12 ppl when two friends joined us at the last minute), and he promptly responded confirming my request. That was a good start.   When we arrived for our reservation at 6:30pm, we were guided upstairs to our seats, and by 7pm the place was packed. We all decided to start with one dish, even though our waitress suggested that we each get at least 2 dishes because on average people eat 2-3 dishes each. We would have started with 2 dishes, if not for the prices. 5 out of 12 people ordered the chicken tinga ($13), and 4 people ordered the flank steak ($14), 1 ordered the tongue and one ordered the meatballs (can't remember the prices of all the items, and they do not have a menu online). I asked our waitress if I could get my chicken tinga without onions, and she said \"sure, no problem.\" I was the only one that ordered a second dish. You see, I grew up on black bean soup, and for $9, I figured it would be an amazing soup to charge that much for a soup made from beans. When the dishes arrived, our first thought was that they were small plates. But they did say that they were tapas, so we could not complain about that. My soup was tiny and it had no flavor. It was so bland, that I imagined the chef throwing a can of black beans and a can of tomatoes into a blender and blending it for 2 minutes and then pouring it on to a bowl. The chicken tinga arrived with no onions on top, which was a relief. But as I looked more closely at it, the chicken was swimming in onions! How can they miss that?   I asked my friends if they were enjoying their dishes, and the consensus was that the food lacked flavor and that the portions were too small. The price simply did not warrant the quality of food we received. So when our waitress returned, we asked for the bill rather than order a second round of plates. I also felt bad for the friends who ordered a beer. $8 for a can of beer? Are you kidding me? This is not a ballpark!   But hey, at least I can now check this place off my list. Coincidentally, several of my friends remarked how they now had a new least favorite restaurant in Toronto. Yeah, it was that bad."}
{"text":"The MFK Fisher quote at the top of the menu (which I can't remember, haha) means two things: 1) shoot, wrong place to eat alone, and 2) they probably know their stuff. Re 1): there was some confusion about whether the person next to me was with me, and a lot of commentary about my eating alone here and why I was doing so, which was a bit awkward.  Re 2): I had heard a lot about Agave y Aguacate and actually walked four miles during a storm for dinner there. I ended up ordering the poblano and the lengua (beef tongue stew). The poblano was a generous portion for $9 -- stuffed to the gills with a lovely guac, pickled onions and carrots on top, and a pineapple sauce. While the latter two elements cut the creamy fattiness of the guac, it was a bit strong/acidic for me. I really enjoyed the lengua -- the sesame seeds on top were a nice touch, though I wish more bread was included.   Service was quite attentive, although note that there's no actual seating in front of the bar -- the smaller tables on the lower level are on the opposite side of the wall."}
{"text":"Went to Agave yesterday with 2 friends.   The restaurant is small and on two levels, with most seating upstairs. Place was very dimly lit. Would be a great date spot or fun for a small group.  The server was great - friendly and well-informed on the menu choices and ingredients.   The menu is meant to be tapas style but we each ordered 2 dishes which seemed to work out well in terms of portions. Dishes were priced between $7-$13 for the most part with a few $4 side dishes available.  I had a poblano pepper, which was stuffed with guacamole. It was huge and delicious and just the right amount of spiciness.   I also tried the tostada, you can't go wrong here. Lots of flavours.  Friends tried the flank steak salad, a mole chicken of some sort and the chileajo (spicy dish of vegetables and lentils). We all raved about the food.  They had a small selection (3) of cocktails available and 3 desserts too. The margaritas went down very well.  Super excellent."}
{"text":"Expect ridiculously long line ups on weekends/sunny days. Worth the wait!  For a small food booth, the chef really knows how to put on a show and get interactive with customers. It reminds me of a teppenyaki experience, where you wait excitedly to see what the chef will do next.  Fresh ingredients are all artistically arranged within the booth  and you can't help drooling a little while you wait.  I tried the Tinga Tostadas (beans, tomato, avocado and chicken). Portion size is not huge but neither is the price, so everything is A-OK.   The next booth over (Arepa Market) is fab too, so 214 August Ave is turning into quite the little Latin hot-spot."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Portion sizes are great if you're on a diet; otherwise, good thing China town's just around the corner.  The problem with hype is that it's usually overdone. I recently attended AYA and left a bit disappointed. I agree with fellow Yelpers that the dishes here are quite tasty, but it's not exactly a value proposition when it comes out to over $50 per head, including 1 cocktail, 2 dishes, tax and tip.  My DC and I ordered the POBLANO STUFFED PEPPER, which was one of the highlights from a taste, texture and spiciness perspective. The BEEF TONGUE STEW was also quite delicious, as echoed by others. The MEATBALL was decent but not *amaze-balls* (wah wah wah). Most disappointingly was the CEVICHE, which while nice and limey, didn't seem to have enough fish.  We dined on the main floor and sat at the awkward wall tables, where your legs end up dangling forward as you twist your body to talk (and this was even with an aggressive game of footsies!). It also felt very cramped, but I suppose some will enjoy this setup and it's not a bad idea per se, given the limited space, but I would try to get a regular table instead. Service was otherwise good, no complaints there. The cocktails were tasty, and I need to remind myself that something's only worth as much as anyone is willing to pay for it, but even then, I don't think they're worth it - go with the beer instead."}
{"text":"I think Christine's yelp was the same review i read in NOW, but maybe not. Either way, had the flank steak salad today. It was pretty damn good, it was amazing watching this dude chop everything up super fresh just for me and my boys, but as is to be expected post-now magazine rave review, the place was packed! My suggestion, wait a while until you go and check it out, or pay someone to stay in the 45 minute line, its good and its pretty in expensive, but gosh did it ever take a long time."}
{"text":"I was lucky, I ordered my food before the line started building up at Agave Y Aguacate.   It was such an enjoyable experience, watching my food being prepared with such care and interact with the chef...   He really took his time cooking everything from scratch... even the Tostadas was freshly deep fried when ordered!!   Tinga Tostadas ($5.50)  - perfect size as a snack!  - Nice mixture of chicken, re fried beans, fresh tomato and wish there is more avocado!   Lime Charolette  - I have no intention to have this dessert!! I would never know what I am missing... until the stranger standing next to me suddenly tell me I have to try it!? He then walked away and came back with another fork and shared half of his dessert with me! (Might be I have that \"Can I have a taste of your food\" look as usual in my eyes??)  - This is a rich rich version of \"Key Lime Pie\"! Soaked with fresh lime juice and draping with olive oil... yet soft and melt in your mouth richness!!   Definitely come and try out some Tostadas next time when you in the Kensington Market area.."}
{"text":"As a Mexican food aficionado (grew up in southern California), this place did not live up to my expectations.   For starters the food, while tasty, was pricey and came in very small portions. Their menu changes seasonally but for the record, my companion and I shared the beans, shrimp salad, avocado \"salad\" (guacamole), a chicharone salad and short ribs. Salsa is considered a side and costs extra. We were still a little hungry after but didn't feel compelled to order more food (nothing really got our interest and at this point we had already spent about $30/pp).   Second, while I understand this place is aiming to do haute cuisine, the menu did not have a single traditional Mexican dish on their menu.   Ambiance is nice; we were there early on a Friday night and had to be seated on the bar area because they didn't have room in their dining room. The waiter was OK -- provided some helpful suggestions at the beginning of the meal but didn't really check in during the meal. Also misinformed us about some of the ingredients in one of the dishes we ordered.   Overall I think 3 stars is warranted because the high price (with good, but not amazing food) and the so-so service."}
{"text":"After waiting forever for Agave y Agucate (@AgaveyAguacate) to re-open since they closed up in Kensington Market, they finally set shop at 35 Baldwin St. Have been a big fan of Chef Francisco Alejandri (@aguacave) and they have acquire even a stronger following after being feature and praised on Anthony Bourdain's Layover.  Nothing fancy decor wise except for this two-story Madonna graffiti and crystal decanter lights    Paloma $12 ~ Trombra + Steigl Grapefruit Radler  Negra Modelo $6  Sopa Tarascan $7 ~ Pinto Beans & Tomato Puree w/ ancho chile, cream, fried tortilla ~ Love the smokiness of the ancho chile and the tomato base just elevated the flavor even more. ~ We were told not to mix it up to get the layers of different texture and flavors, each ingredient seems to add depth and richness to the soup.  ~ The cubes of Queso Panela cheese was a great addition.  Ceviche Verde $13 ~ Market white fish macerated in lime juice, gently tossed in a corriander mint & habanero paste w/ tomatillos & sweet onions served w/ totopos ~ The Ceviche wasn't as good as I remember, it\s a tad too tart in my opinion which lack any other complimenting flavors, event the creamy avocado didn't help much but still love the big pieces of fresh fish.  Chile Poblano Relleno $8 ~ Blistered Poblano Pepper stuffed w/ guacamole & pineapple topped with pickled vegetables & subtle tomato sauce ~ I have this on my mind since I saw it online and it truly didn't disappoint. ~ Loved it, def one of the highlight of the night.With the perfect amount of heat which is smoth down by the creamy chucky guacamole with the most perfect light tomato sauce.   Tostada de Tinga $9 ~ pulled poached chicken tossed in a chorizo, tomato piquin & chipotle pepper sauce served on a tostada w/ well-fried black beans, avocado, crema & pickled red onions ~ This was by far my fave dish of the night,  definitely wish we ordered one each. So good, such intense flavors.  ~ The chicken was moist and flavorful with just enough of heat, even the beans was so yummy smooth with the creamy avocado n a pop of flavor from the pickled onions.   Pollo en Pipian Rojo $11 ~ Fryer chicken in red sesame sauce w/Ancho chile garnished w/softened almonds ~ Love the thick sesame sauce and the chicken was perfectly cook, so moist but thought the presentation wasn't that great and the bread was sort of hard.  ~ Maybe some bean rice on the side instead of bread.   Chocolate Caliente $4 ~ 70% dark hot Chocolate w/ a medley of Mexican spice Liquid gold, we can't help but wonder what was the spices in it.  Carlota de Limon $6 ~ Mexican biscuits layered w/ a lime custard drizzled w/ arbequna olive oil & garnished w/ lime zest & black salt ~ Ok, I know it's not the best looking dessert but it was really delicious, surprisingly not sweet andwas surprise how the olive oil and black salt go so well together here.   Main level room is pretty narrow with the bar on one side and small bar tables/stool on the other side.  Verdict : ~ Love it !!! ~ I was glad that it's simply authentic Mexican cuisine, nothing fancy and no trendy fusion things like kimchi and definitely no boring fish tacos. ~ Love how the dishes was spaced out really well instead of all the dishes coming at the same time (ahem all the other popular Mexican restaurants) ~ Great attentive service, our water was filled timely and our waiter came back to check on us"}
{"text":"disheveled approach/environment bu I really like supporting this type of micro-business Food all were super-fresh and very tasty...love the empanadas and the menu had a few more items that I'd like to try someday. Try the tosdadas...you'll like it."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, a true Mexican chef that puts so much love into his cooking and it shows both in its simple presentation and its amazing flavours. I won't go as far as saying that this is a nice quick meal as he is normally a one man show and it can be quite the wait especially around peak lunch hours but if you can find the time its well worth the wait."}
