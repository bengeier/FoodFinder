{"text":"Formerly Rincon Latino (an El Salvadorian restaurant with lackluster food, where you were SOL service-wise unless you had some rudimentary Spanish speaking skills), this little Colombian restaurant is tucked away in a quiet shopping center in the industrial part of town; surrounded by dentists, Sally Ann, and the Glenmore Inn. We were originally on our way to an Indian place that claims on their website to have a lunch buffet 7 days a week, but they were closed. Boo-urns. We stumbled across this place on our way out of the parking lot. 

Service was pretty mediocre, but I guess it's pretty excusable, since the restaurant is divided in to two sections and they only had one waitress for both. We seated ourselves and sat around waiting and waiting, but no one acknowledged us or bothered to get us menus. After a few minutes of sitting around and enjoying a Colombian instrumental of The Neverending Story Theme; we decided to get menus ourselves, when the lone waitress ran to our table with them. She half-apologized, then disappeared around the other side of the restaurant. After another few minutes she took our drink orders. I ordered a Guyabana (Soursop) drink, and appreciated that they give you the option of getting it with or without milk. I got it without, and it was very light and refreshing.

The menu was devoid of vegan options, but after a brief conversation with the waitress, I was able to wrangle a plate of vegan enchiladas. We also ordered the non-vegan enchiladas with beef, and a couple of Bandeja Paisas. The Bandeja Paisas included everything in the Wikipedia description: red beans cooked with pork, white rice, ground meat, pork rind, fried eggs, plantain (patacones), sausage with lemon, arepa, hogao sauce, black pudding, and avocado. My vegan enchiladas also came with a side of white rice; a giant, flavorless slice of beefsteak tomato; avocado and shredded iceberg lettuce. The soft and fluffy arepas were a pleasant surprise, since the last place we had them cooked them to the point of chewy perplexity.

The food was delicious, honest tasting comfort food. Nothing Ã¼ber fancy or incredibly spicy, but you could tell a lot of effort went in to the preparation. It tasted like going to a friend's house for dinner because their Abuela was cooking. We were chastised for asking for chips and salsa (\"uh, that's a more Mexican, but we can bring you arepas with cheese\") and asking for a lime in the Corona (\"sorry, you see, Mexicans do that\"), but once the food came out, we were glad for the lack of chips and salsa; portions are huge here!"}
{"text":"I just discovered this place the other day, near the industrial park where I work. They have a $8.99 lunch special each workday. Today it was Tuesday and Tacos.

Wow yum it was great! Authentic too! No rice and re-fried beans, instead you got 3 incredibly filling tacos made on corn shells, all with fresh avocado and tomato, choice of pork, steak, or chicken (I got one of each) it was awesome! I will be back for lunch next Tuesday."}
{"text":"3 stars is pretty good in my book. The food is very good. The restaurant is clean. A bit on the pricy side but bearable. The staff is polite but the service is a bit slow. I've been answering email and doing a little work and no-one has bothered to check on me since they served my meal. Still, I appreciate having a Colombian meal so far from Colombia. A must for me on my anual visit to Calgary."}
