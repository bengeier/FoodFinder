{"text":"It was deliciouss Middle Eastern food.  I had a gift certificate to use @ Layalena.

We ordered the pork chops, shishtawook, kibbie, and lamb.  My mom also got some lentil soup.  We got kibbie for appetizers.  The kibbie was flavorful and the filling was moist.  It's good, but not exceptional.  First of all, I LOVE THEIR RICE (BEST MIDDLE EASTERN RICE HANDS DOWN).  IT'S FLAVORFUL, BUT NOT GREASY LIKE AT SEVERAL OTHER RESTAURANTS.  We got four little pork chops per order with a load of rice and salata.  It was soo good the pork chop was moist and flavorful; it's not the best I have ever had but it comes pretty close.  The lamb was cooked perfectly without the gamey taste that usually comes with unskilled lamb roasting.  It came with rice and salata as well.  The shishtawook was BETTER THAN Aladdin's (see previous reviews).  It was so much more flavorful and moist.  The dinner portions are huge too!  I didn't try the lentil soup- I'm not really big on lentils.  

It's slightly pricier than Aladdin's by 4-5.00 for certain dishes, but for the quality and portion of food you get- it's well worth it.  

The atmosphere is exotic and nicely decorated with plenty of Arabian influences.  On certain days they have bands and music playing as well.  I want to go back on a hookah night. 

The food was a heavenly meshing of unique flavors and exotic goodness :).  I will definitely go there again next week."}
{"text":"So, I was coming back from the airport, trying to try out Ohashi, which was closed.  Dejected, I decided to try out something nearby, which, in this case, was a sparse but lively in colour palestinian joint.

Sporting a stage for a singer and belly dancing, Layalena serves mediteranean fare simply.  My chicken kabobs were competent.  I'd have to go back to have a clearer sense of the quality here.  Flavourful and tender, it's certainly not bad.

Hookah pipes and belly dancing make appearances on Saturday, apparently.

Perhaps one day, I'll make a trip out!"}
{"text":"I have really enjoyed the several meals I have had from Layalena.  Their Fattoush is amazing.  The spices they put on top are absolutely delicious.  Their Hummous is good, not great, but good.  The shawarma sandwiches were juicy and extremely tasty.

Very good, and highly recomend."}
