{"text":"This place has become a weekly spot for me. I love creating my own juice, it's always fresh and perfect. You can tell the staff enjoys their jobs and are always willing to answer questions or help pick! Really cool look inside, too."}
{"text":"I am not an expert on Juices however basic knowledge a juice is good when fresh made not premise and kept in the refrigerator. I went twice and the juice seems water down and no flavor. The people that work there need to be a little more organize because it took them 12 minutes to get me the juice and I was the only client. Hopefully they improve because juices are great if made correctly"}
{"text":"Great juice/smoothies, slowest service everrrrrr.  I keep thinking it will get better but every time it takes forever."}
{"text":"So this is my guilty pleasure. Guilty because I could technically not pay a ridiculous amount for a juice I could make at home. But it's so delicious and I'm lazy, so there I go to spend my cash on one of their delicious fresh juices. 

Try this place if looking for a healthier, not so cheap option."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place. Unlike other juice and smoothie shops I never worry about the ingredients here. No added sweeteners or artificial ingredients which is awesome. Try the green smoothie or peachy greens - these drinks will make you look forward to getting your daily dose of leafy greens!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last 4 months, after my sister-in-law raved about acai bowls. I like that the acai purée is mixed with avocado (less sweet than the typical banana) and it has an excellent fresh fruit and granola topping with almond butter to pump up the protein. My rating is 4 stars because the bowl isn't always consistent (one time they were out of avocado, toppings vary in quantity, another time I got frozen banana chunks at the bottom of the bowl). But their service is always good, friendly and relatively fast (lunchtime can be busier than when I've been in the morning). Healthy and delicious--it's a great combination!"}
{"text":"I came in to get something healthy on my day off work and left fuming mad. I had recieved a $5.00 off coupon from a Yelp event. I picked a juice that was $7. 7-5=2 right? Well, I was surprised when she said 3.50. I said that's not right because it's 5 off. She said well it's tax. I said over a $1 in tax. So then she tapped it down to $2.71. I knew it wasn't right.

I paid then I asked for a receipt. I asked if I have a receipt option, and she said \"I text it to you and emailed it, we're paperless here.\" And she proceeded to help the next customer. I moved out of the way and pulled it up (the email), and the attached picture shows I didn't get $5.00 off. Just $4.50 off after I questioned the price.

I took my concern to the other front staff, and they asked the cashier to pull up the transaction. She told them \"I didn't know how to take $5 off.\" I showed them my emailed receipt showing I didn't get my full discount. The gentleman handed me $.50 and said \"does this help?...I'm sorry...\" I told him he should not have to apologize for someone else's rudeness. It should not matter if I had a coupon for 5 cents off or 5 dollars off... I should get my full discount.  I also said I would not come back because I didn't do anything for her to treat me like that. Then the cashier said \"I'm sorry if you took it that way sweetheart\" in a very sarcastic tone. I told her I'm not her sweetheart and that's not how you apologize. She wanted to carry on mumbling things while her staff was repeating to her to stop talking to me that way. I repeated again that I would not come back if this is the treatment you get for using a coupon and questioning it if the math is wrong!"}
{"text":"Please note: this review is ONLY about their acai bowl. I will update it if I try other items from their menu.

I don't usually leave a review for a place I've only been to once, but I went specifically for acai, and knowing the limited amount of acai in this town, the people deserve to know.

Juice Bar is an absolute ripoff. I say that as someone who is HAPPY to pay close to $12 for a good bowl - but not this nonsense. To start, it is ridiculously small (see my photo for scale). When I saw her pouring the acai blend into the bowl, I was shocked. It's about 1/3 the size of what I'm used to (same size as Rico's small, I believe). With a price tag of $9+, I was annoyed already.

Next was the presentation. Now, I don't need every bowl to be \"insta-worthy.\" But when an excessive amount of granola is dousing the bowl, and precisely four blueberries and 5 slices of strawberries top your bowl, it feels like you're being pranked. I recognized the granola, which means it was likely commercially made. The almond butter was good, but it was down at the bottom of my bowl, which is unusual. Zero effort for presentation or even equal distribution of toppings.

Finally, the flavor. Nothing special. I added protein powder ($2!!! what! plant protein is NOT that expensive) and the flavor just wasn't impressive. 

One positive? Their smoothies and prepared food LOOK good. Again, pricey, but if the flavor and execution are better, that may bring the rating up. But I will not be buying their acai again."}
{"text":"I always come here when im feelin sick or about to be sick. I get the recovery drinks and boy do they do wonders! I love them! Good prices too. Really healthy!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite juice bar in town.  The staff is always super friendly and quick and I have enjoyed every juice and smoothie I have tried.  Tell the staff what you like and they can quickly help you decide what to try!  Sweet Greens is amazing :)"}
{"text":"Best in town! I've been looking for a GOOD juice bar since I moved here from Northern California, and finally found a keeper. They press on the premises and have all kinds of fresh juices to taste and choose from! My new juice spot!"}
{"text":"What can I say...I  Juice Bar is the best. Service, Smoothies & Juices are great! I Love Juice Bar is one of my favorite places to go especially when traveling. The Acai & Smoothies always hit the spot when I'm most hungry. 
Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a juice fanatic by any means. Just your average Jane, and so maybe I'm not the best person to evaluate? But this place just seemed OK.  When I think of juicing, I think super healthy, super fresh, super clean.  The people here are super friendly and I was able to get a free juice when I brought in a coupon from a snail mail-er, so was worth giving a shot.  My two main gripes is that when they're making the juice, you can see them pulling all the ingredients out of boxes and cans and bottles and are frozen - which kind of takes away from the whole \"fresh\" idea. I would suggest they put all the ingredients in unlabeled clear containers so that it really feels like you're getting something not manufactured.  Also, they don't have any notices for allergies (I'm allergic to nuts and soy) and so they had already made the shake before I realized it was made with almond milk, which I can't eat.  Luckily, they  made me a new one, but something for future reference."}
{"text":"I have been to Juice Bar once, and it was a great experience! I ordered the Ginger Greens and and it had just the right amount of spicy and sweet (it has apples in it as well). We also ordered We Got The Beet, and it was awesome too! The manager even came out and gave us both a free sample of the Kale Salad, which was awesome. I'm sure this place does very well, I would highly recommend it over the juice counter at Earthfare."}
{"text":"I hate beets. Like loath them. Well.... at least I thought I did. 

I love the beet smoothie at Tropical Smoothie Cafe but the small sample I had of the Smooth Beet. Woooooo... Tropical Smoothie who? Dude gave me a big ass sample because he had some left in the blender from the customer he just served. So friggin good. Wait... did i tell you how good the Smooth Beet is? 

Okay so I got the PB&J. Also really good. I've had something like this at The Healthy Home Market but this joint was better. 

I'm already looking to see how I can work this place into my morning commute. Yea... it's that good. 

They have snacks... bananas, apples, extremely healthy muffins. I don't believe I saw any products with processed sugar listed as an ingredient. 

Oh... and I will definitely be there in the summer for an Allergy Shot. 

Customer service was on point. One of the guys joked a bit when I mentioned Tropical. I'm getting good vibes from this place. Definitely have to check out their other location."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! !! The team is very friendly as well as happy to be working there. Maybe it's because they juice everyday.   Will return on my next visit to charlotte, NC"}
{"text":"I do love Juice Bar. They have a wide selection of fresh juices and smoothies. There is really something for everyone. I highly recommend the Sweet Green for any first time visitors. It is a great green juice with a ton of tasty flavor. Don't let the color scare you away. 

Their cleanses are also very reasonable and they give you a lot of flexibility in making it work for you. I'd love to see them add a frequent purchaser punch card. The system they have now just tracks visits but I'd like them to track the beverages purchased instead."}
{"text":"Is the acai bowl supposed to literally have only one tiny slice of avocado hidden in the center of the bowl? Was a bit disappointed..."}
{"text":"Went here hoping to get a tasty fresh juice. I asked for a a green juice without parsley. The cashier asked the other staff member if that was possible. The other staff member replied, \"Yeah no problem! I'll just put the base in there!\" I paid $7 for the small juice and then was told when I got the juice I only had cucumber and pineapple juice due to the base having the parsley in it. I was very disappointed. 

Unfortunately my juice only tasted like cucumber. I really don't know if it had any pineapple in it. 

Staff was nice, just didn't dress very professionally. They all wore what they wanted-not even a company logo shirt."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a fresh juice/smoothie/juice/shot/juice cleanse. The menu has tons of delicious-sounding options and if you're stuck on a couple, feel free to ask the staff! They will help you narrow down your choice(s) or introduce you to one you didn't even consider!

The latter was what happened to me during my visit. I couldn't decide between two, all I knew was that I wanted a smoothie and for it to contain mint/ginger. The guy behind the counter told me that the 'mint to be' was his favorite so I figured, 'why not?!' and ordered a small. 

There are two sizes for the juices and smoothies: small and large. A large juice/smoothie will run you close to $10 which I find sliiiiightly ridiculous but that's the price you pay for convenient, fresh juice. 

Besides the juices, there's a refrigerated section that boasts pre-cut fruit (watermelon, pineapple, etc), yogurt & granola parfaits, wraps, sandwiches, even fresh coconut! They sell these hockey puck sized bars that are delicious! They're in gold packaging near the cash register and will keep you full for a while!

Depending on the time of day, this place can get packed so pack your patience!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, great prices, awesome atmosphere.  Everything is whole fruit and vegetable based.  They have juices, smoothies, and a short list of bowl type food items as well as to go snacks.  

There is a nice bright sitting area and bar counter in the front, but don't miss the comfy couch area toward the back.  And they have wifi! :)"}
{"text":"My four-year-old and I stopped by here for lunch after school and she loved it! They were even able to tweak a smoothie for her to adjust for her kid like tastes! I had the pad Thai noodles and she also had a muffin. What a perfect lunch right in the middle of where we had a bunch of other errands The run. Thank you, juice bar! Delicious as always."}
{"text":"I'm pretty upset I just paid $10+ for an average tasting bowl that was really small. It tasted fine and the location is clean but the bananas weren't as fresh as they should have been and the bowl is TINY!!! 100% take your money elsewhere. I've had my fair share of Acai/smoothie bowls in the last few months and this was by far the smallest one I've gotten and for about $2+ more than the other places I've been to."}
{"text":"I'm not new to the juice life. Finally got to check this place out! I'm normally by them on Sunday's and they are closed! We walked in and asked the lady at the counter what juice she recommended. She was like I get smoothies, so really offered us no help there. That's when Tyree stepped up and showed us the ropes there. He was very helpful, kind, patient. He asked us if we would like to sample some, and let us sample some of every juice they offer. That's what's up! They have some good juices there. He also told us what was popular and recommended his favs to us as well. / they also have smoothies, and bowls. / we tried: the coffee Janet smoothie & the beet juice. Both were good! I also was impressed with their prices. Bc as you know, eating & drinking healthy isn't cheap. But compared to some other juice places they were cheaper. Small range $6-7. Large $7-9.75. All their bowls were under $10 with some even being $5-6. They do a loyalty type program where you enter your number and after 10 visits you receive a free large juice or smoothie. They also have a couple couches in the back by the restrooms. Nice little nook, with books, puzzles, Jenga."}
{"text":"Never in a million years did I think I would give a juice place a five star review.  I just recently got into juices and smoothies, so I'm making the rounds through all the spots in Charlotte.  Juice Bar just blows them all out of the water.

First, the juices are great.  I also like that there are the calorie counts on the menu board so you can figure out how you want to allocate your daily allowance.  My go-to is the Sweet Greens.  It's a little higher in calories because of the apples, but it's delicious and fills you up.  As an alternative, try the Pineapple Greens.  Still sweet but lower in calories.

Second, I just signed up for their check-in, so after 9 purchases, your 10th juice is free!

Everyone at both this Juice Bar location and the other one in town are so incredibly friendly.  They must treat their employees well, because they treat the customers well.  Maybe at some point I'll try one of their healthy snacks, or maybe even do one of their juice cleanses...maybe."}
{"text":"Finally a real juice bar in a heavily trafficked area! Very good, straight-forward menu. Unique factor: addition of essential oils to consume in smoothies :)"}
{"text":"Mint to be!!!! Yum this place is cute and conveniently located in park road shopping center. 
100% whole fruits and veggies. 
They even use products from local farms! 
I haven't branched out beyond the mint to be smoothie (mint mango pineapple coconutmilk and  apple juice) but they have juices, power shots, lots of protein bars, some salads and a little grab and go section for lunch/snacks. 
They have a check in system after you buy so many you get a free one. So that's a nice treat! 

Down side, they take forever. Plus
They have another location in South Carolina, right near my orthodontist and I must say the staff is way better down there. Friendly, personal, and give samples/ recommendations etc and are a little more efficient and get your drinks out fast"}
{"text":"Best Juice bar in all of Charlotte! I love their juices and their smoothies! It's the most freshest I've tasted."}
{"text":"As a general business model, I don't understand how juice bars have become so popular. They are pricey and pretty much everything they offer can be made at home without much effort/commitment. Still, on occasion it's just more convenient to grab a juice or smoothie to go, so here we are. 

I've only been here three times and each time has left me feeling entirely underwhelmed, mainly because it has taken at least 15 minutes to get my order. I could've gone to Harris Teeter, bought the ingredients, and made it myself in roughly the same amount of time. So much for convenience. 

They do have a pretty varied menu which is nice. And I've always been pleased with the quality of my juice and/or smoothie. The staff is friendly, too, so it's not that it's horrible. I just think it's a bizarre concept to begin, made even more so by the slow turn around."}
{"text":"After my last horrible experience a few months ago, I did what management asked and gave them another shot today. Same thing except it was a little faster. WE GOT THE BEET juice: the only thing that was actually juiced from whole fruit (as is promised on their webpage) was the carrot. They used pre-juiced beet, ginger and lemon all from the plastic containers they store it in. And once again, Martinellis brand apple juice. Doesn't taste fresh...isn't fresh. $10 rude customer service has been my experience at every visit. Videotaped it this time."}
{"text":"First time at juice bar and I loved it! I got the cocoa banana smoothie( cocoa powder, peanut butter, protein powder, banana, spinach, and organic coconut milk)! I think it has around 42g of protein. It was phenomenal and filling! I sat in the back lounge and was able to finish up some homework, enjoy great music, and enjoy a great smoothie! I recommend this place to everyone! Give it a try, I did, and I LOVED it!"}
{"text":"I was really craving an acai Bowl of some sort for lunch and saw juice bar had them.

All of the ingredients are super fresh, but the prices are a little high for the portion size.  Make sure you are a member of the rewards program because that will earn rewards. 

I got the dragon fruit bowl.  It was ok, I wouldn't get it again, but I would like to try the acai Bowl or chocolate bowl.  

Their smoothies are packed full of nutrients and there are a lot of customizable options."}
{"text":"I got 2 juices that cost $18.75 and they charged me $24. It wasn't worth $18, let alone $24!!! I'm never going back there again!"}
{"text":"I had a very poor experience using the mobile app, but the understanding employees and their speediness made up for my initial contempt. Employees, keep doing what you're doing. My acaí bowl was delicious. 

Owner(s), you need to re-evaluate your mobile application. I have ordered many acaí/smoothie bowls before, but never from this establishment. I chose \"Acai Bowl\" and saw there was a drop downs for \"Add-ons\", so I chose \"Pineapple\" from the drop down. I included my phone number in the designated area (I had assumed in case they had a question about your order), then went to the store. My order was not ready upon my arrival because they did not understand my order. I was very confused by this because I just chose from options that were presented to me. They said I should have typed either \"frozen pineapple\" or \"fresh pineapple\" in the comments area. Why would I know this if the app only has \"pineapple\" as an option, then does not instruct me to specify? I've always assumed add-ons for these bowls go on top, so I've never thought that there would be a need to specify between different types of pineapple. Additionally, the employees said they do not have a way to see the phone number I included with my order - they can only see what I ordered. What is the point of the phone number section if the employees can't call during these types of situations?

Overall I had a good experience."}
{"text":"Decided to give Juicebar a try as I'm doing 30 days no meat, no dairy, no sugar... Typical juice bar spot, seating area and high bar. I ordered the Doc, it was only ok. Nothing impressive I made much better from my own kitchen! Berrybrook farms can be very slow but from my experiences better. Having lived in DC, Atlanta & Chicago i can't say I have ever paid $12 for a smoothie"}
{"text":"This place is really wonderful. I can't stop ordering the Mint to Be. It probably has the least vitamins or nutrients of all the tasty juices and smoothies here but gosh it's delicious. I also love the Green Smoothie and the Orange you Glad. nice staff, quick turnaround, tasty drinks, and most of all great location."}
{"text":"Amazing staff, and if you ask them questions they'll actually help you make choices. Very good customer service. A bit loud to \"work from\" but will do in a pinch because of the couch area in the back."}
{"text":"You can tell the care and effort Philip and Jenny have not just put into creating an AMAZING environment but how they have cultivated their team. My husband and I have stopped in numerous times and have never had anything but excellent service and whatever we order is great! Take your time with browsing the menu - try new things (as everything is crazy good) and ask questions as everyone is very eager to answer your questions or let you sample juices."}
{"text":"So delicious and that is rarely the case when something isn't BAD for you! I'm bummed they are closed on Sundays as that is when we usually go next door to Brueggers. I'm partial to the \"very strawberry\" which has apple juice mixed with strawberry and banana. It's definitely a different, lighter twist. It is a bit pricey, so this is more of a treat than an everyday thing for me."}
{"text":"I love this place. I frequent quite often so I appreciate the incentive of free smoothie after a certain amount of visits. I've pretty much tried all of the smoothies and they are all good"}
{"text":"My first time visiting but definitely not my last. The juices and shots are amazing. The workers are very knowledgeable and friendly and willing to offer suggestions. The menu is organized and list all the ingredients in a juice, smoothie, or shot. I had the Orange You Glad and a shot of the Slim & Sassy. It was very refreshing and rejuvenating especially after a work out. I'm excited to go back to try more!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I got the \"Orange You Glad\" and it had a little kick to it kind of like a spicy flavor. If you like that sort of thing, go for it. I like my drinks sweet so I ended up swapping with my sister who had the \"Ginger Greens\" and it was amazing. The staff was super friendly. I'll definitely be back again to try more juices!"}
{"text":"Been to the juice bar multiple times but usually for food blog events. Went and bought a The Doc smoothie. Expensive but totally worth it! Delicious and healthy"}
{"text":"The pineapple and greens juice was so so. I expected it to be much sweeter. Maybe it had a little too much lemon in it for my liking. But the PB and J smoothie was spot on.  The service was pretty quick even though it was busy. I expect to pay more for healthy options but the pricing seems a little high. Although I would pay it again especially for the PB and J."}
