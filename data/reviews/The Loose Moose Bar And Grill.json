{"text":"If you don't mind paying a whole lot for the convenience of eating inside Great Wolf Lodge, then this would be a decent choice. The food is fairly good. But between just getting out of the water park and juggling 3 kids in a restaurant, I definitely don't feel like it was worth the $20 per person to eat here. Drinks aren't included in that price either.

Tip: don't get the \"Strawberry\" shortcake. It is terrible cake with strawberry gel on top. It was inedible."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant inside the Great Wolf Lodge. They offer breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They cater very well to the typical eating times for meals, but are open all day. 
We had lunch at on off time of 1:30 pm, so there was no buffet and just menu service. We were a party of 11, with 7 of those being kids. The service was very slow and it took about 1 1 /2 hours to get through the meal just due to slow service. There were lots of other employees but they didn't assist once the food came out, so our waitress had to bring it in three different trips, then go back for stuff like ketchup and dressing. I wish they had more of a helpful attitude and someone could have helped her bring the food which turned into about a 15 minute timeframe to make the 3 trips. 
the food was decent for the price, nothing bad, but definitely not spectacular."}
{"text":"Perfectly fine food.  Service is mediocre but eating there is a no-brainer with a credit.   Can do better elsewhere but they are trying to serve good food and convenience is worth something too.  We had heard food was poor but it definitely was better than that"}
