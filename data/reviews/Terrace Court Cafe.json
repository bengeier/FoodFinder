{"text":"Want to kick it old school cafeteria style? Then you've found your place. Located on the third floor of West Canadian Place, this cafeteria is everything you'd expect from a cafeteria, hairnets and all.  Their main \"hot food\" area offers things like daily special of a macaroni casserole or Salisbury steak. They also have a deli area for a selection of sandwiches, a soup area and a small salad bar. There are also a couple of refrigerated case - one with pre-made salads and sandwiches and the other with sushi.

The cafe itself is pretty crowded and in a U shape. I went for a late lunch (after 12:30) and it was still quite busy. I can only imagine it is pretty packed earlier. They have a few tills though so paying moves fairly fast. The forks and cutlery are out in the \"lobby\" area where there is ample soft seating and tables of varying height, some overlooking the building lobby below. It is a bit noisy so this would not be a place to escape with a book at lunch.

The Terrace Court Cafe does a decent job of everyday, simple, comfort food lunches and there is likely something for everyone. Their prices are reasonable compared to other downtown lunch options. It's not fancy but lunch doesn't need to be fancy every day, does it?"}
{"text":"This cafeteria gets a lot of traffic because there really isn't anything else in the area to eat. As far as Grab and Go food, this is the only cafeteria within the 3 block radius. So don't take the crowds as a sign of good food. The food is somewhere between prison and high school cafeteria food. Usually unsalted, lazy, but cheap. 

Entrees run $8.50 - $10, sandwiches and wraps about $6-$8. Soups start at $3.50 and the salad is one set price, by the box. However, it's the most boring lettuce only salad bar. I'm guessing everything is bought in frozen bulk and prepped, which is why it's so mediocre. 

There's a cash line and debit/credit line, so bring cash if you don't want to wait another 10 minutes to get out of here."}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty good. I used to come here almost every Friday and they always have Fish n Chips as their daily special. And not only was it cheap, it's honestly the BEST fish n chips I've ever had, and this is coming from someone who regularly orders fish n chips at restaurants. I'd eat it every week but it's probably not the healthiest thing to do. A few of my coworkers told me that she came on a Thursday and they had grilled cheese as their daily special and she said she liked it a lot. 
The staff are all really nice too, they don't give you attitude and they try to engage in a conversation unless they're really really busy, which is reasonable. 
I also like how all the cutlery are outside in the lobby, and not inside the actual cafe."}
