{"text":"Wonderful.

I was a fan of Mucho Gusto even though the food was never amazing.  It was just a fun place and great location.  Now, it's even better.

We started with the Sweet Potato Croquettes which were insanely good.  Hot, sweet, tasty - so good.  My Mom had the black bean soup to start which I tasted and was delicious.  So much flavor.

For entrées my Dad had the salmon which he said was delicious.  My Mom had I both had the Gypsy salad which is: Seared halloumi with spring mix, mascerated figs, bleu cheese, candied pecans, red onion, bulgur wheat, fried chickpea and balsamic vinaigrette. It.was.so.grood.  Sweet and spicy and the bleu cheese was amazing as was the halloumi and everything just tasted delicious.

My Dad (of course) ordered the strawberry shortcake bread pudding (I MEAN SHUT UP) for dessert and I had one bite only (I was really proud of myself) and it was insanely delicious.

I am SO excited this place is in Tempe now and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to get to The Revival since it's opening and finally made it in for dinner last weekend. We had made a reservation, were greeted by a friendly host and seated right away. Our server was attentive, pleasant and helpful. The decor of what looks like reclaimed barn wood, the copper topped tables, the lighting, all gave a comfortable feel to the setting.

The list of wines by the glass is extensive and reasonably priced-hubby and I each tried two different selections. Can't remember the names, but really enjoyed the Rosè and and the red blend.

We started with the scallop appetizer. Perfectly seared, melt in your mouth delicious. And, hello, deep fried avocado-yum!

Hubby had the salmon and I the braised short rib. Both so well prepared, beautifully plated, and many a step up in the flavor department. We would have loved just a little larger portions, simply to prolong the goodness!

The Revival is a keeper, I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"The food was interesting and delicious.  The meals we had would have cost much more in other eateries.  The combination of tastes, colors, and textures were...inspirational.  Our service person was attentive, personable, and knowledgable.  

We're already eager to return."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing.  Overpriced, but even worse- over salted.  Oh my.  I think the salsa and the beer were the only menu items not sodium based. Yuck.  

However, the ambience was nice and the staff was very friendly (although SO SLOW).

Meh."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to the Revival on Valentine's Day on a suggestion from a friend who worked at the former Four Peaks Tasting Room.  We arrived just after they opened and had our pick of the outdoor tables.  The staff was amazing!  Our waiter was so polite and friendly and answered any questions we had about the menu and drinks.  He kept apologizing for the long wait, which I thought was unnecessary because we were enjoying the lovely Saturday afternoon and the absolutely delicious bloody Mary's the bartender prepared for us.  Also, the wait wasn't long at all, I think he was just being accommodating.

The food - WOW.  Having been raised on New Mexico style Mexican food, I was worried I wouldn't like this newfangled stuff they had on the menu.  We opted for the chips and guacamole and vegetarian Rellenos.

The chips and guac were fresh, tasty, and full of good spicy flavor.  The rellenos should be their own food group.  They come atop some potato substance that has me craving more, just a few days after, and stuffed with spinach and covered in the most wonderfully delicious sauces I have ever tasted.  It was spicy and fresh and absolutely perfect!  

For desert we took home the berry empanadas and vanilla ice cream.  I ate them later that evening and wished I had ordered more!  They were absolutely fabulous.  Fried to perfection with cinnamon and sugar and stuffed full of deliciously sweet, fresh berries.  Don't miss out!

We moved in to the bar to finish our drinks since the restaurant was filling up with reservations for the Big Date Night.  The bartender was absolutely fabulous and made us feel so comfortable and welcomed.  Other staff members also stopped to chat with us.  We felt like we got back some of what we were missing from the Tasting Room and that whole Tempe community vibe.  VERY friendly folks working here.

I can't wait to bring friends, co-workers, and family back for more delicious food, drinks, and laid back ambiance.

Ask for Kevin or Lindsey as your servers; they will treat you like family and make sure you have everything you need.

LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Our first  visit was excellent. So was this one. A party of six started with chips guacamole  salsa and three orders of mussels.  Main courses ok couldn't do it. More appetizers  duck taquito, fish taco and empinad's one chimmichanga. The food flavors best described WoW. Desert they brought bread pudding. Thank goodness  they had spoons once people tried it it was a fencing duel. We had to order another. We will be back."}
{"text":"Hands down best cocktails and tacos in town. The staff is over the top friendly, experienced, and have a great understanding of other restaurants and how they should look and feel. This place is my new \"go to\" for any business lunch. Everyone I have ever taken there has agreed that they are the best tacos they have had."}
{"text":"Hope it isn't closed forever. I love the food. Good ambiance. Not too loud. Great for date out or a Night with friends."}
{"text":"Don't bother.  Poor service, expensive for what you get, bland atmosphere.  Four of us went last Saturday at 7 pm.  Out of soup, out of one appetizer we ordered.  Server couldn't tell us about the wines.  They did have the shrimp appetizer (for $16), 3 shrimp to feed four of us - you'd think they'd gauge the number in your party and at least give you one shrimp per person.  But no . . . those babies cost $5.33 per shrimp.  Garnish of pickled cauliflower tasted like a hot dog with too much French's mustard - overpowering.  I wouldn't even think of ordering one of the entrees which cost upward of $20.

We wanted to sit outside, but most of the tables were only \"for decoration;\" out on the patio but not sealed, so unusable.  Restaurant redecorated with what look like pallets - could use some color - at least some plants.

I can't believe, and hope, this place doesn't make it."}
{"text":"Overpriced/small portions/mediocre food! The food was pretty heavy handed on the spiciness. Not a problem for me, but the people I went with were not expecting it. There was a long wait considering the restaurant was nearly empty. Not worth it, I don't plan on ever coming back. Though it is BEAUTIFULLY decorated... The decorations must be figured into the price."}
{"text":"I went with three others and we all shared 2 salads, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. This was a great way to taste about half of their relatively simple menu. I especially liked the Gypsy salad, the shrimp and chorizo, and the achiote salmon. They've done a great job with the build out of the space with a great use of reclaimed wood and some nice AZ design details. Kelly Fletcher came out and checked on us, which was an extra treat. I will be back and I recommend."}
{"text":"We had been going to Mucho Gusto for YEARS and LOVED it. We work right down the street and that was our go-to place. We decided to try The Revival today for lunch - our whole office. The food was tasty and appetizing and we knew that Chef Kelly Fletcher was the Chef at House of Tricks so we knew the food was going to be great. But because we still have House of Tricks, we REALLY missed Mucho Gusto. There is just no place like it so we were a little disappointed that it's gone. We all had an idea - what if some of the new menu offered some of the old favorites from Mucho Gusto? Big ass burrito, a few of the taco plates, guacamole and the amazing chips and salsa. Now that's a place we would go back to over and over. The Revival - we just assume go to House of Tricks because the food is so similar."}
{"text":"I love what the owner has done, wasnt a fan of mucho gusto, but THE REVIVAL, IS AWESOME. I love all the vegetarian options too!!"}
{"text":"Closed.  Nothing on website indicates this. We went there last week and there was a handwritten note that said closed for summer."}
{"text":"New fave in town. Food is amazing and is a treat to the taste buds. Green chili pork stew. Holy mutha...speechless."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at the Revival. Overall, the food was good. I met up with my husband there and a neighbor (who had been there for an hour already drinking and feasting) to order a cocktail and an appetizer.

The pork belly is good, but not as good as Pig and Pickle. They had a thinly sliced potato at the bottom and I felt like that was a bit too acidic for the pork belly. 
I had the chicken and I thought It was good but a bit too salty for my taste. I had to give it to my husband who is an athlete and is always looking for extra salt. 

My husband had the duck confit and I had some of it and hoped that I had ordered that instead! The polenta was nicely cooked and the flavors were spot on.

One thing that I did not like was one of the waiters. He had a stuck up feel to him, making comments about 'oh i only eat at ___'  and 'my pallet is very sophisticated', 'i wouldn't dare eat at ___' and trying to make it seem like he was better than us. Given that it was their first week, I would have preferred to not get that from the waiter.

I would go here again but now I'm warned on how expensive it is. The drinks and some of the food is a bit above what the neighborhood calls for."}
{"text":"My hubby and I visited this new place today for lunch. We got there at lunch opening and it was not full at all which was great for quick seating. It did full up around noon. Patio seating available which would be a nice option when the weather is cooler. Nice decor and ambiance. Casual but also good for lunch during work week. We heard that chef was former chef at house of tricks. So we wanted to try it. We ordered the revival burger and steak salad. Salad came with fries. Portions on both were good. Both entrees were great. Nice flavor on steak and burger. We couldn't stop eating the fries. The women's bathroom was clean and nice but i found it weird that the toilet paper was just sitting on the back of the toilet. Couldn't spring for a holder?? Other than that all was good with this place. Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Best chips and guacamole (huge portion)! Came here for date night with the hubs. After all the chips, guac and salsa, we decided to share the green pork flautas and gaucho steak. Delicious! Sat outside on their nice patio. Nice ambience despite the street noise. For the the quality food and price, we'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Found out about The Revival after sifting through 17 pages of the same old Yelp results looking for a place for lunch - I live and work in Tempe and am running out of new places to eat, so I was stoked to find out that this place had opened just a few weeks ago. As soon as I read about the chef's association House of Tricks, I knew I had to go.

We got there around 11:40, which was perfect because it was right before the lunch rush started rolling in. Being a new restaurant, I wasn't sure if it would be busy, but it was once it hit noon. Clearly the word is spreading fast!

Everything on the menu looked amazing, but I decided to start by trying the Charred Korean Pork Belly sandwich, which was great. The flavors actually reminded me more of Banh Mi than Korean food, but being Vietnamese I can't complain. :)

The atmosphere was casual and relaxed. A great place for lunch, but I can also see myself coming here to unwind for dinner and drinks during happy hour.

Basically, I just left and I already can't wait to go back! It's definitely a place I can see myself frequenting in the future."}
{"text":"Amazing food, pretty impressed. 

This place to hard to find at first, it is by Oregano's  and Rag-o-rama. 

The food was on point, I ordered the short ribs, that is def a must here. Meat was perfect, spice was perfect."}
{"text":"Came in pretty for late dinner based off good reviews and bc they were open and relatively new.. It was nice to see a place with better than bar food open past 10 in tempe.  The cocktails were good but the food was much better. I ordered every appetizer for the table, made a nice light dinner, perfect for throwing down beer after without exploding..  Check out the pics. Everything was great! My favorite was the fried avocado under the scallops. ;) nice large salad as well, pork belly was meaty, ribs were unusual, but good. Cocktails n every app and a salad, $100"}
{"text":"I met some friends at this new place this last Saturday. I had never been to the previous Mucho Gusto, but this new place is very good!  The restaurant is decorated in the new \"hipster\" decor like a lot of new places in the area.  It doesn't bother me too much, I let the food tell the story.  The food was great!  I had the braised chipotle rib.  very tender, lots of flavor.  The corn and beans that came with it was very tasty! Being not a fan of most \"Mexican\" food places in Tempe, this place isn't authentic Mexican, but it is well done! We also had some chips and guacamole. Those were good as well.  Service was pretty good. We all enjoyed ourselves.  Plus some live music playing some 90's hits.  Drinks are little on the pricey side would be my only complaint.  But, I will be back to try some more of their yummy food!"}
{"text":"I'm really on the fence about trying this place again. On one hand, I liked the wine/cocktail list, the appetizers and ambiance. On the other, the service was lacking and the entrees were tiny and oversalted. 

My sister and I came for restaurant prior to seeing a show at Gammage. I made 5:30 reservations so that we wouldn't have to rush dinner. Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened due to a 30 minute+ gap between our appetizers and entrees. Our server never checked up on us or explained what was happening until after we flagged down someone else to order another glass of wine. I was also irked that our server took my silverware after I finished my first course but never bothered to replace it. Luckily, the host sitting at the door rushed over to give me a new set so I didn't have to wait on our server again.

My sister got the vegan cauliflower bisque which had a light texture and nice basil flavor. I loved my fried manchego. It was like the best part of a grilled cheese sandwich accompanied by a delicious roasted sweet tomatoes. The succotash entree, however, was minuscule and almost ruined by the heavily salted wilted spinach. The shiitakes in the dish were very good though.

The desserts were both decent. I got the chocolate almond croissant pudding, and my sister got the vegan blueberry coconut parfait. We both agreed hers tasted more like a breakfast dish.

The patio looks like it will be very welcoming during the cooler months. Maybe after a couple months, I'll be ready to give Revival another go."}
{"text":"Update! HOLY GUACAMOLE. This place has THE BEST guacamole my friend and I have ever eaten. It was perfect. The duck taquitos and the braised short ribs were, ugh, so good. I love this place. May even be my favorite in Tempe."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! The pork belly melts in your mouth and the wings on the starter list are amazing! Also worth tasting is chorizo and shrimp starter- with harissa- it's spicy but yummy!  For main dishes the short rib is great- moist and flavorful. Also worth mentioning is the vegetarian option - it came with portobello mushrooms which were marinated and prepared perfectly. If you are a bread pudding fan I'd stay away- it was a bit on the dry side but the Vietnamese Coffee is savory and a great dessert."}
{"text":"Ok, wasn't impressed. Came for happy hour and did small plates.

First sign things were amiss..
1. our almond horchata, we saw the waiter pour some almond breeze milk into the drink. we politely called him out on it when he brought it over, and he admited, \"they don't get enough orders to make it worth it, so they cheat.\" if that's the case than don't put it on your menu!  
2. guacamole - they are smart, its served on this bed of cabbage in a bowl giving it the impression of quantity but it's not.

on to the main meal.. we did small plates.
tried their chorizo steamed mussels, duck taquitos, and green chile pork stew.

everything was super salty and a bit too rich for my taste buds. But prices weren't too bad for happy hour, i think I would have been even more annoyed if I had to pay full price.

happy hour (going off of memory here): 4-6pm, $1 off small plates, guac for $5 (normally $7)"}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of Mucho Gusto so I have to admit it's hard to walk into this building without craving their chili relleno with mushroom and walnuts. There's a great relleno on the menu at the revival but it's entrée size and I wanted to try some small plates instead. I had the ahi ceviche, which was a special. And the empanada. The ceviche was very flavorful with good spice. The empanada had a lovely creamy sauce. I enjoyed both of them. My friend had the Gypsy salad and it looked really delicious."}
{"text":"The last three times I came here I got the Cuban. It is incredible. I love this place. Cool atmosphere too.  Right off mill and university."}
{"text":"Had an outstanding dinner here.  The cocktails were fresh and strong.  When the shrimp with chorizo and pickled cauliflower came to the table I knew we picked a special place.  I also got a cup of soup which was very generous in the amount of chicken in it.   Girlfriend got the salmon entree and I the duck confit, it was one of the best plates that I've ever had.  
Also, very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Such a tasty dinner! Great service. Great guacamole. THe Butternut squash was delicious too, as was the monchego cheese, and they catered to my 7 year old daughter, making her whatever she wanted in lieu of an official kids menu. Great meal before the Rock and Roll Hall marathon!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here for dinner one night back in March and we had an amazing and memorable experience.  First, the patio is fantastic - large, shaded and totally relaxing.   Our server absolutely, hands down made the night even better - he was funny, engaging and completely directed our culinary adventure.  We started with some craft cocktails that were expertly mixed and a great way to kick off our experience.  We shared the braised duck taquitos to start and we shared the chile relleno and the chimichanga for our appetizers.  The food was incredible and our server convinced us to order some things we normally would not have.  This place is definitely worth checking out next time you are in Tempe!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had reservations for 5:15 on 9/21 and when we were seated the restaurant was fairly empty. Service left much to be desired from the unwelcoming greeter, to the bartender that nearly ran me over as she walked past me. The server was sweet but never came by to refill a drink or update us on our order.

So our order, which never came, left much to be desired. After waiting 45 minutes for our appetizers we asked if they were coming only to be told we'd have to wait another 10 minutes. At which point we left. 

Really sad, the food looked good and the place seems to have potential."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been twice. Each time we sat at the bar. The first time, we just had two appetizers. One was the scallops over the fried avocado, and the other was a nightly special of the green pork chili. Both were outstanding. The chili was very spicy so not for the faint of heart but I like that. The scallops were AMAZING. I had the flour less chocolate cake. It was good for what it was but not the amazing homemade dessert I Wanted. The 2nd time we went, we split an appetizer and an entree. For the app, we had the pork belly. It was ok but my husband liked it more than I. There was this green purée under it that I eventually identified as peas. I hate peas, but I didn't hate the dish, but I didn't love it either. But then we split the duck confit entree and it was amazing!!! Truly. Yummy. The dish sizes aren't huge (except the green pork chili) but both times we visited, we left satisfied and no longer hungry."}
{"text":"WARNING: Small plates=tortillas with some lettuce on top....there wasn't enough fish to make one taco let alone 2.  They did however address it when I showed him the amount of fish by bringing me another ounce of fish......

The rest of the guests were happy with their meals.  Just shy away from the Small Plates if you want to get filled up.  I think I'll stick to the spinach salad I had previously.

The grilled cheese sandwich with soup is a delicious looking meal for those that are interested!"}
{"text":"I checked out the Revival today for a work lunch meeting. It was really good!

I had been here when it was Mucho Gusto.  What I has heard was the menu has the menu has changed and it was renovated. Well we were pleasantly surprised to hear they have brought back most of the original MG menu with a few twists. 

The lunch specials were just enough portions. I has the half burro with chicken. I started with he tomato soup. Both were delicious and just enough kick. My coworker had the fish tacos and said they were very good as well. 

We had great service and I would come back."}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming here. Nice vibe and the food is always amazing. Had the Cuban sandwich this time in, and they nailed it."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times. First two times it was the best food I've ever had! Tonight was sub par though. Super salty sauce and dry chicken"}

At The Revival....ooh oh
Your food is a heartbreaker
At The Revival....ooh oh
Your food is a life maker

The Revival is a little off key place away from the crowded Mill Ave.  My first impression of the place was wow this would be a cool place to hang with a live band!  The place serves up what I would consider Southwestern and American fusion food.  

I came here with a date on a Wednesday night so the place was pretty slow overall.  I didn't care for having the staff hanging at the bar since as a manager of the business; that bothers me much.  I ordered a Whiskey and ginger and proceeded with ordering for the both of us.  The menu was split from small versus large plates.  We shot for the small plates so we can share.  We ordered the Braised Duck Taquitos, Steamed Mussels, and Patty's Fish Tacos.  The mussels were excellent for a chilly night as it was when we attended; warm chipotle-chorizo sauce giving it an extra kick of spice along with some crustini bread.  The fish tacos had a subtle bite and a minor kick of chipotle; crunch from the cabbage, but one thing I notice most was the corn tortilla which tasted homemade.  The duck taquitos was well plated, topped with radish and red onions and surrounded by a tomatillo and pablano sauce -- Oh yeah probably my favorite of the night.  

We finished the night with some Mexican Chocolate and brownie to an already great night of eats.  Overall, a great place for a foodie to grab some experimental bites! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 11am to an empty restaurant, not a good sign. We ordered tacos, 4 different kinds to get a good feel for the food here. While deliciously seasoned, the two tiny tacos were hardly worth $9 a plate. 

As a side note, the carne asana meat was very fatty, not trimmed well at all. I can't stand big chunks of meat fat in my food so I left most of the meat on my plate.

Meanwhile the waiter brought me the wrong beer. I didn't notice until he left, so I sipped on it for a while. By the time I was offered a replacement beer, I was 3/4 of the way through the beer and finished with the tacos.  I'm not a 2 beer at lunch sort of girl so I declined a second one. I wasn't comped for the mistake at all, just got a 'sorry' from the waiter.

Overall, once is enough. Won't be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Heard about The Revival from a bartender at the Mellow Mushroom.   I travel to Phoenix regularly for business and happened to be in town on a Saturday night.  Since I was alone, I sat at the bar.   The bartender, Cara, was excellent and the wine manager David, offered excellent suggestions.  

I had the shrimp and chorizo appetizer, the salmon entree and finished with the Chef's bread pudding.   The quality level was well above the price for each course.  In a foodie city like New York, Chicago, San Fran or Philly, you would pay more for the same quality.

As someone who dines alone fairly often, I tend to return to restaurants where I receive excellent service and some nice conversation along with food that meets or exceeds expectations.  I will be returning to The Revival."}
{"text":"Love the food I especially enjoy the Duck taquitos and the Live (The Island) music on Saturday nights is a great way to kick iff the evening. I would recommend it for any occasion."}
{"text":"Love this place! The Mussels are awesome! You will want a straw to slurp up the sauce they come in. Luckily they serve bread with them so you can sop up the sauce. I also like the braised rib tacos. I like them so much I have ordered them two times in a row! Get chips and sals while you wait and don't add salt to the chips, they are pre-salted and perfect the way they are! Great place for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed by my experience here. We made a reservation at 5:45 pm on a Saturday night, thinking we probably wouldn't even need one.  When we arrived, we were told that there were no available tables inside---no apologies on behalf of the staff. We were asked to sit outside until one became available. When our waitress came by, she let us know that several of the items of the menu were no longer available. Then she said there wouldn't be enough time to order actual meals if we wanted to be out by 7:00 pm (we were catching a show at 7:30 pm). SO, we left without ever having a chance to try the food. While the waitress was apologetic, nobody offered us anything that would push us to give Revival a second chance. They clearly just don't have their act together yet."}
{"text":"Well, that was expensive! Why do I feel like I didn't get the rest of my meal? I had Duck Confit, which was cooked delightfully. Just seemed like the plate was not complete... no starch? 

I am not against foodie places. I just usually feel like I have had a good meal when I leave. This meal seems to be inadequate. Waiter never asked hit everything was, perhaps he is sick of hearing about it?"}
{"text":"This... 

I... 

No words. Incredibly. Heavenly. Best short ribs I have ever eaten. Literally couldn't keep my eyes open while eating. It was that good. Gave me shivers."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a delightful find! The service was very friendly and efficient, despite them being very busy and the food and drinks were amazing. The restaurant features local brews and spirits and their mixologists incorporate spirits from AZ Distillery into spectacular cocktails. The food was incredibly good - amazing combinations of flavors! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been to The Revival three or four times now and the food is so delicious! We have had the green chili pork tacos, the chipotle braised rib tacos, and the carne asada tacos. We also just had the grilled cheese and tomato soup. Best I have ever had!!! 

The staff is nice and the ambiance of the whole restaurant is relaxed and comfortable.

I would definitely recommend giving them a try!!"}
{"text":"My review has dropped a bit, but stands at a solid 3.5 star.  My main complaint about my recent experience is that the food was WAY OVERSALTED!  Like whoah!
But otherwise, it's still a nifty place. The service was excellent.  I still adore the upcycled aesthetic.  The owner even told me how to do the copper tables at home.  I REALLY hope they bring back the steak salad."}
{"text":"Okay, I had them at four stars due to liking some things but missing some of the Mucho Gusto items but they have shifted - still new items but some of the favorites from Mucho Gusto are back on the menu, like the gaucho steak and the chiles rellenos. I went with some friends from work after a training and we played Cards Against Humanities (they have several card and board games) over drinks and dinner. I also noticed the price point on items has come down as well so the cost is more in line with what it used to be. I think this is a good example of an eatery trying something new and then shifting back a bit to incorporate things that people missed but still having new items like the selection of cocktails and the larger wine list. On Thursday night they also had live acoustic music which was wonderful! I have to say, I'm much more inclined to start coming back to Revival on a regular basis after this experience and they were quite busy on Thursday night so I hope they are doing well."}
{"text":"My husband & I wanted to try Revival during Restaurant Week.  I guess when we first walked in we should have had a clue it might not be the best experience.  Bottom line - their service was probably the worst we've experienced at a high-end restaurant ever.  

We had reservations for 6:30, we arrived a few minutes early and were told they were on a wait of about 20 mins - um then why did I make a reservation.  So we went to the bar to grab a drink while we waiting and ultimately never got helped before our table was ready.  We were seated and about 10 minutes later our server came over.  As soon as she came to our table she didn't seem to have a clue about too much.  She took our drinks orders and about 10 mins later we got those.  Mind you the restaurant is not that large - maybe it seats 40 - 50 people.  It was busy when we got there but most tables had been there a while & were finishing their meals.  

Anyway I could go on and on about how slow & inexperienced our server was but I'm guessing you can figure that out from my rating & my first description of our server.  We also witnessed another table who had been seated for at least 10 mins with no attention from a server, they got the attention of the host (who by the way was wearing a backwards ballcap) he said \"Oh let me get your server\" but what he should have said was \"I'm so sorry, what can I get you to drink\".  He walked away and another 2 - 3 mins their server finally showed up.  

The good - the food was great!  with the exception of the dessert, Habanero Bacon S'mores with Dark Chocolate & Shortbread - it was cold.  I typically don't eat my S'mores cold.  

One other thing to mention - on the restaurant week menu online it states \"wine pairing offered at additional cost\", our server had NO idea what we were referencing so we gave up & ordered our own drinks.  

I'm not sure that I could recommend this restaurant to anyone at this point.  Again the food was good but for the price and the poor service we received (again we saw lots of other tables receiving the same poor service) there are too many other great restaurants in the Valley.  

Sorry Revival!"}
{"text":"AMAZING the wine list is great! My friend and I shared the caprese salad and the salmon dish with fried avocados and at first I was nervous because the portions looked small but I left satisfied and very full. It was the perfect amount to share!"}
{"text":"I've been a long-time fan of House of Tricks and chef Kelly's creations so it is no wonder the Revival was a big hit. I was sad to see Mucho Gusto go but the great location and beautiful patio spot will keep people coming in. Now first off this certainly wasn't the cheapest lunch but I dug into my pocket book a little deeper because it is well worth it. 

A few of my favorites from the menu are the caesar salad with its spicy dressing and pumpkin seeds and the braised short rib sandwich with shallots and an apple cider slaw. The fig itabout it cocktail was wonderful. I can't wait to go back for dinner and try out one of the steaks."}
{"text":"Chef Kelly consistently hit it out of the ballpark tonight. The Revival is even better then tricks- and I used to eat at tricks a lot. As always the pork belly was out of this world- as was the duck and the scallops. Nice wine list, and great cocktails. I was even impressed by the coconut cream dessert. The neighborhood needs a chef like you who has vision and can really cook. Yes, it is a little more pricey then other neighborhood restaurants, but it is well worth it for the quality, artistry and thought that goes into the dishes."}
{"text":"Super!  When you team Chef Kelly Fletcher with Sommelier David M Johnson you know you're going to experience magic. Achiote Salmon was a great flavor festival in my mouth.  We also tried the braised short rib which as good as we have ever had. Love the creativity of the food and the large (and well priced) wine list. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"The Haloumi cheese salad (not the name on the menu) was so delicious I want to go back again NOW!  Great innovative menu, nice comfortable atmosphere, terrific service, what a wonderful addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I came in to dine solo and the bar tender served me.
I had s bit of a cold do I decided not to drink alcohol. I requested the coconut fizzy limeade! It was refreshing and delicious! The server followed up with another on the house.
I ordered three small plates.the duck, shrimp cocktail and a cheese and chorizo! The shrimp was pretty tasty but slightly scarce in the sauce. The duck was great. The cheese was really good. The food is spicy and intense. 
I was sad the menu had no desert ! Would have gone for it if I was offered. 
The seating and ambiance is relaxed and the music is really good. Will be back for sure
Will surely be back"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity  to swing by on a lower key Wednesday evening.  Patio was open and the doors remained opened to allow the beautiful weather to sneak into the bar area.  $5 craft cocktails were the special and the Pablo honey was a deal for that price.  Fresh basil, honey and ginger beer balanced out the drink and of course the rum!  I sat that the bar (the seats aren't the most comfortable).  The Gypsy salad was a winner, with large portions of seared hallo ump cheese.  I wish the walnuts were raw (they were candied) but the greens were crips and the onions sharps.  My meal was from the small plates-steamed mussels in a chili cream sauce with a chorizo pick de gallo.  The mussels were a little small, but plentiful.  Overall, great dish!"}
{"text":"So I got into town looking for something different.  I saw this restaurant and turned around and wow was I surprised.  Started with the Tomato Soup which was freaking awesome.  A little spicy but not too much.  Then the tacos arrived.  Delicious I really liked them.  

The staff was great really friendly.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My office co-workers and I decided to take on of our own who was leaving out to lunch . . . and this place was suggested.  Been here many times before . . . when it had a different name and different owners . . . so I really did not know what to expect.

I was pleasently surprized . . . I ordered the Big Ass Burrito with Short Rib meat and an Iced Tea.  As some of you know I am a BIG guy . . . so I was expecting a BIG burrito . . . it was a good size, but not the biggest I have had . . . and though it was very tasty . . . the best bites had the Short Rib Meat . . . which this burrito could have used more of.   The Iced Tea tasted fresh brewed and was nice and clear.

I will definately be back to try more of the menu , , , and it is definatelly worth trying."}
{"text":"Stopped in to check out the Revival for lunch. They have a great patio that will be perfect for outdoor gatherings and enjoying the weather. The music selection was perfect- a fun mix of \"feel good\" music.

I scanned the menu, and looked around at other diners plates. Looking forward to coming back for the burger and duck taquitos. I sat at the bar and ordered the mussels and a bowl of black bean soup. Soup was delicious. Mussels were tasty- even though I'm not a fan of cream based dishes. The chorizo was a bit overpowering with the cream broth- and the dish could be better if switched out to a broth base- as both are pretty strong on their own. 

Bartender was very attentive and made sure my water was always full. We will definitely be back. During the week it's a great spot for lunch meetings, etc. Great to have them in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Re-decorated, re-named, new menu, new chef, new new new. Was fortunate and grateful to get a table at the soft opening. Gonna miss mucho gusto. Seared scallops for the appetizer were really fantastic, if not just a tad too sweet--they're in a bed of \"gran marnier syrup.\" The black bean mango soup with chorizo is fantastic. Will get it again next visit. The duck was very very good, although just a little chewy. The half roasted chicken was the best of all the entrees I tried. Prices here are higher than what they were before, although the dishes have the quality and presentation to justify it. No entrees under $20 makes me wonder if the heart of a college town is the best location for them, but our server told us a happy hour will start once the grand opening happens. All the servers are awesome, attentive, knowledgeable of the menu, and friendly. Great beer selection, and extensive wine list as well. Definitely plan to return."}
{"text":"I try to go at least once a week. I would say best restaurant in Tempe, but it might be one of the best in all the valley. They actually listen to the customers too...example the steak with chimichuri was a special  and myself and a bunch of buddies who frequent the revival said they need it back...last week went back to a new summer menu with the steak on it!!! Yummmm"}
{"text":"... Words cannot describe how impressed I am with this amazing Mexican fusion cuisine. Came here with my sister, boyfriend, and a close friend of ours. We spent the first 20 minutes fighting over what to order because everything looked so good. The mussels are BOMB!!! Chef kelly is brilliant and the definition of hospitable. Tempe may not be ready for this level of deliciousness. Thank you REVIVAL!!"}
{"text":"I've been a long-time fan of House of Tricks and Chef Kelly's work there, so it's no surprise that he's bringing it to the waltz, so to speak, just a few blocks away at The Revival. 

We swung by for lunch today and I had a fantastic short rib sandwich with great fries, while my lunchmates thoroughly enjoyed their grilled cheese, duck sliders, and reuben sandwich. The host and server were quick and took care of things, and while they're still getting their build-out situated, the food was completely fantastic. I'm excited to try out dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious burrito for lunch. I got the half ass with carne asada and it was just right. Came with a quality fresh salad without oodles of dressing.

My friend had the pork tacos, which are his favorite and he is a regular. 

The chips and salsa were equally tasty especially the salsa!"}
{"text":"I was in town from NYC visiting my cousin and we ended up enjoying a Saturday night dinner outside on the patio while listening to some great live music.

Great food and service, as well as a lot of good vegetarian options as well!

Gladly recommend this and I will for sure be coming back"}
{"text":"The Revival has massive potential, but lunch needs a little reworking.

Everything about the ambiance and service at The Revival is \"correct\" by hip, urban restaurant standards (see: St. Francis, Phoenix Public Market.) 

The menu is evocative and drool-inducing (sorry for drooling on your paper menu.) \"Macerated figs\" appear enough times to garner applause, and flavor combinations come across as creative, yet comforting. 

We ordered the braised short rib and seared halloumi sandwiches. The blackberry preserves, arugula and crispy shallots on the short rib were kind of lost in the gruyere & meat flavor. The halloumi received similar feedback: much bread, little filling. Where did you go, deep fried tomato, spinach, mustard, caramelized onion and aioli? With such thoughtful, complex flavor additions, there should be more substance... *sideways glance* especially for the price.

As far as sides, both the apple cider slaw and chorizo spiced fries were excellent, but the fries were on a whole different level from everything else we tasted. Like, somebody needs to make it rain chorizo spiced fries on me at some point in my life. 

Not to be the fat kid here, but... 4x as much braised meat/fried cheese in my sandwich next time. Plus, all the fries, please."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner last night - it was a must since the chef came from House of Tricks.
Started off with the pork belly appetizer - the celestial nugget melted in my mouth - salty, sweet and tangy from the vinegary potatoes that lay underneath.
Next we had the sweet potato croquettes - crunchy on the outside - moist on the inside. I really liked the citrus infused sauce drizzled on top.
The gypsy salad with slices of seared halloumi cheese on top was to die for - it also had blue cheese mixed throughout which didn't hurt.
Husband got the ribs - tender with a chili infused rub and let's not forget, the cheese/ale soup with popcorn topping. Brilliant concept and healthy ( I tell myself) because it contained sliced apples.
The star of the show, however, was the bread pudding - maple, bacon, bourbon, apples ............oh, my.
I will be back."}
{"text":"Loved Chef when he was at House of Tricks. the food at Revival was good but we were expecting more. The menu is way too limited: sandwiches, a few salads and not much more. I don't believe Chef is living up to his potential or stepping out of the box. He needs more choices. I had the duck breast sandwich and it was good, but the homemade potato chips were way too salty (and I LOVE salt). my husband had the special soup: chicken asian noodle: was good but had a bit of a fishy flavor. They did have decent but not huge wine/beer choices. We enjoyed our meal but will likely not return or at least wait for several months to see how things progress."}
{"text":"Amazing Braised Short Rib!!! I would eat this for dinner every night for the rest of my life. Enough said..."}
{"text":"Nice place, good atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff. It was quiet when I came, so really relaxing. Good music too. The food was decent, but not many lunch/brunch specials. We ordered the braised duck taquitos and bean burrito. The sauce and spice kind of drowned out the flavored of the duck, but it was still good. Bean burrito was okay as well. A bit on the pricey side for lunch. Seems like a better place for drinks and such, since they have many more drink specials."}
{"text":"So looking forward to trying this place and was sorely disappointed. Entering the courtyard on a chilly December evening and the lights were twinkling and fire stoked in the corner fireplace. Artistically designed booth backs with old suits in a quilt pattern were intriguing, but that's where the ambience stopped. We were greeted and seated with a lack of emotion or warmth. Menus were placed in front of us and they were ... dirty. No specials mentioned, no happy hour mentioned (we were there at the start of HH), and a general lackluster vibe ensued. When questioned, our waiter knew nothing of the drink concoctions (shame on him) and told us the sign on the wall with specials was outdated because they didn't have chalk-skills. We finally decided on a few items - Pablo Honey cocktail was TOO spicy to even drink, but the fresh pineapple juice helped a lot. Chips and salsa were requested and dropped on the table. Delicious salsa - greasy but hot tortilla chips. Free on the Happy Hour Menu, but $5 otherwise. Shared the short rib dinner (pretty good), the vegetarian squash option (soggy with a very spicy avocado mixture), the duck taquitos (YUMMMY) and the green pork chile stew (decent flavor and good consistency.) Nothing special here - sorry. Oh, and we were charged for the FREE Happy Hour Chips & Salsa. Embarrassingly slow service, but the guy filling our water glasses - on it!! Won't be back."}
{"text":"My girl friend and I met for lunch! It was great! Not to busy and the Street Tacos where amazing, we ordered and shared all of them and I gotta say, they were spot on. I would know ;)"}
