{"text":"Quaint eatery with delicious food. Seating is available at any of eight tables. Maximum capacity is 30 people. I had the daily special omelette. It comes with a salad on the side; I opted to upgrade to the \"Marie Claire\" salad. Very nice."}
{"text":"Really good food ( I had a quiche). But the hours are a little hard to work around (but no biggie, it's a great lunch place). The only thing is that i find the wife/waitress/co-owner pretty standoffish. Not really rude, but kind of touchy. The food is good, so i would still go there, but maybe with the thought in mind that the service is not the warmest. Give it a go!"}
{"text":"Was not expecting this.  I took a couple of my employees out for lunch nearby to a client site.  We walked into a rather unusual environment--at that time, we were the only males in the place.  I thought we had made a mistake, but the server welcomed us, guided us to a linen covered table, and handed us the one-page menu.  A bread course was brought to start, and we looked over the options.  The special today was Steak and Mushroom Pie, an addition to the Chicken Pot Pie and the Beef Pot Pie.  Not entirely a fan of pot pies, I am a fan of steak and mushrooms, so that had my choice out of the way.  My guys ordered the Chicken and Beef variants.  My dish arrived with a delicious side Caesar with a dressing that had a rich flavour of mustard.  And the pot pie was amazing--incredibly flakey and flavourful crust that I could eat as a cookie if it were flat and empty.  But this was filled with tender steak cubes and button mushrooms Delicious!  I had the opportunity to purloin a few fries from my associate's plate.  They were deliciously seasoned, putting many other fries to shame.  The attentive server offered us the choice of Cherry or Chocolate pie for desert. I refused, envisioning a standard sugar bomb that would drive me into a diabetic coma.  Even homemade, cherry pies are usually very sweet. Then I saw a unique dish at the next table.  It looked like an artisan crust with what could have passed for Creme Brûlée.  This was the cherry pie, made with WHOLE, REAL, FRESH cherries, pitted and baked into a lightly sweetened custard.  I handed the server back my bill and asked her to bring a slice with 3 forks.  She did better than that, dividing the pie between 3 personal plates.  This pie was amazing!  My biggest regret was asking for 3 forks!  They also sell some of their scratch cooked dishes at the farmer's market on Saturday.  I contemplated buying a whole cherry pie (either cooked or ready to cook) but I knew it would be gone before sundown."}
{"text":"Sadly this little gem of a restaurant has closed its doors. I was a very satisfied customer for over ten years and will dearly miss Gabriel and his cooking."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Aurora. I've gone here on occasion since I was kid (I recall the original, smaller location across the street!). When I worked in the Yonge and Wellington area it was my top lunch spot. Seriously, I still dream about the Marie-Claire salad. I wonder if they'd ship the dressing to Alberta? Haha. The hours are a little funny but it doesn't detract from the great food or experience."}
