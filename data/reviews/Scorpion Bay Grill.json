{"text":"Awesome atmoshere, only real gripe was had to pay 6 dollars to enter county park where place is located. Food was good, not great, prices as expected. Could use a better selection of malt beverages, no mikes, no smirnoff ice, no hard root beer, nothing except angry orchard. Sit on the dock if the weather is nice. Long walk from parking area, fairly steep stairs to dock, equally steep going UP after dinner. They do have 2 very slow trams if working. Nice place to bring a date or significant other."}
{"text":"A group of us went to this grill yesterday and everyone loved their meals. My hubby got the lobster grilled cheese and raved! Our service was exceptional. Definitely will go back even if we aren't boating."}
{"text":"Wife and I have been members at Scorpion Bay for years and love the new restaurant, great menu, great presentation and the staff is so welcoming, good job Troon."}
{"text":"First time here... was a beautiful location with clear water surrounded by mountains.  The restaurant offered a nice variety of options along with reasonable drink prices.  Eating was outdoors, so sitting in the shaded area required a jacket, but there were several tables in the sun.  Both the club sandwich and Reuben were great!  We will certainly return.... will probably rent a pontoon too and tour the lake."}
{"text":"It is hot beers showed up hot not in an Ice Bucket. Food well my husband's food showed up and mine well I am still waiting. Disappointed"}
{"text":"First time to Lake Pleasant park. Dropped by Scorpion Bay Marina Bar and grill. Friendly staff and fabulous Navy Bean and Ham soup. Cheesecake for dessert. Started with Scorpion Bay marguerita. All yum and a beautiful spot to chill."}
{"text":"We were out hiking around lake pleasant and found this restaurant. They are in the middle of remodeling, so not many places to sit in the shade. We sat on the dock in the sun. Not too bad.  Husband had the big fish taco, which was very good. I had the shrimp salad with artichoke, olives, and marinated peppers. Really good. Reasonable prices. Friendly servers"}
{"text":"Don't let the construction fool you! This grill is open and delicious! The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. The food was delicious and the deck had a great view. We walked in 15 minutes before it closed and they happily served us without complaint. We loved this spot!!"}
{"text":"Needed oil for our boat and they charged us 40 dollars for the same thing Walmart carries for $12.00! Talk about screwing your customers! I could understand charging double but this was really gouging someone who needed help. They figure they have you over a barrel and there is nothing you can do about it! What a way to treat your customers! Then, went to the restaurant afterwards for convenience! Waited for 1.5 hrs to get our food! Had a party of 11 but there was no excuse for that! Be prepared to make waiting the most of your day while out on the lake. There is no indoor seating! Go to Dillon's across the lake if you want a huge menu, good prices and a break from the heat."}
{"text":"OK , Update , the new Cabo Tacos are my new favorite !  My wife's is the wedge salad with shrimp !  Mud pie and key lime follow these nicely too . lol"}
{"text":"This place was a joke, being remodeled extremely hot inside nothing at all like the online portrays is. We had cocktails  and a couple of appetizers, it was so miserable inside the place we couldn't even finish our drinks. I would totally suggest skipping this place. On line reviews are not accurate"}
{"text":"If you love eating great food on a beautiful lake in Arizona this is the place to go. There is a beautiful scenic drive up and a fun tram down to the Grill and the marina. The menu selection is excellent, the service is friendly and accommodating, the drinks are good and the food is fresh and delicious. With ample portions and excellent quality the pricing is in line. A relaxing and lively place to eat."}
{"text":"Scorpion Bay has great food while still being super affordable given the location. The wait time for food seems a bit long even on days when the lake is not busy at all but you can't really complain since it's extremely convenient."}
{"text":"Because we are at the marina on a regular basis we have been back a couple of times since my review in March, 2016. Really no change, the food is good, not great. The service is somewhat inconsistent - sometimes good but not great, and sometimes not so good.   One nice change with the new ownership is the weekend breakfast buffet. As far as breakfast buffets go its good, but not great. There is a good selection of eggs, quiche, bacon, sausage, fresh fruits, etc...   It looks like the overall complaints from the other comments have to do with the service. Management might want to make a note on that issue."}
{"text":"Great restaurant on a floating dock on the lake, makes you feel like you're dining on a boat! The food was really good too. I don't have very high standards for places like this because there's no competition around. However, we were very pleasantly surprised with the quick service and great food. $36 for 3 meals seemed reasonable as well."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times, service is ALWAYS slow.  Yesterday we waited 30 minutes for a table, no problem.  3 ladies at entrance, one seating patrons other 2 folding napkins. All 3 RUDE.  When you'd attempt to ask a question they'd turn and walk away.  Waitress took our order, waited 35 minutes for water, meal arrived 15 minutes later.  I consider myself a rather patient person, but I DO NOT like being ignored when I ask a simple question, I won't be back.  I wanted to leave after a half hour but was overruled. Food was average, nothing to write home. Price was high, 12 to 16 bucks for burger type food.  Well I wish you the best, because folks will read this and go anyway. Yes I'm one of those.  Good luck"}
{"text":"Just came from there for Easter Lunch. Can't find absolutely nothing bad to say about this place. Great service,great food,large portions,beautiful surroundings,along with fair prices. One last word---try the Pretzel Plater--unbelievably good (and large)"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that this has always been a favorite place for us to come to.  The food has never disappointed and they make a killer Moscow Mule.  Today, however, was the day we said \"never again\".  We asked for a table outside even though it was pretty warm and we knew they had no fans or sprinklers to cool things down (also only about 3 umbrellas spaced out so you had to move your table to get to sit under one).  It was the attack of the bees that did it for us.  They circled us when our drinks were brought out, then started getting aggressive during he meal.  The waitress came over to ask if we wanted anything else and we told her we were seriously upset about the bees.  She said \"sorry about that, is there anything else I can get for you?\"  We spent the rest of the meal swatting bees and finally decided we couldn't finish because they were all over our food and going down the straw.  We asked for the manager who told us that there's really nothing they could do about it because the EPA has told them they weren't allowed to put up traps.  She said they have tried other \"natural\" methods, but nothing seems to work.  If the problem is that severe during bee season they need to warn people that want to sit outside of the issue.  They could have offered to move us inside or to comp our drinks or something to accommodate the fact that our meals were ruined.  I understand that bees on a lake restaurant can be an issue, but I'm not convinced that something can't be done to protect the customers."}
{"text":"Sadly I must rate this place 3 stars. The staff has been extremely friendly however it took 15 minutes to just get someone to get our drinks down. It has been 40 minutes to finally get our food. It seems to be that the place has so much potential but just has very slow service. I ordered a Scorpion Bay Drink. It was delicious. Made to perfection with just the right amount of alcohol. The Scorpion Burger we got us very good but the waitress didn't listen very well. We said no tomato and cheese on the side. However everything came on the side. They forgot another order of wings. There were 2 wings. Avoid this place if you don't want to wait 40 minutes for food. You are better off going to the other restaurant at the lake."}
{"text":"Wow! Loved this place. Came here a couple times when it was still Dillons... but never really liked it. After Dillons left they became Scorpion Bay Grill and remodeled. It was fantastic. The service was perfect and the food was great. We had potato skins which were some of the best we've ever had anywhere and also had a Buffalo Chicken sandwhich and Turkey Burger. Both were perfectly cooked, large portions and the fries that came with the burger were unique and amazing. They had the perfect amount of crunch and softness inside. I absolutely dig the new look outside and will certainly start coming back more often!! I highly recommend this place if you want to have a great lunch while floating on Lake Pleasant.. this is your place!"}
{"text":"Want expecting such good food at a marina! Salmon stuffed scallops over kale were delightful! Surprised!! Good beer and service too."}
{"text":"Good food simple but the drinks are a big draw for locals I'm guessing. ... Huge water brought to the table especially appreciated after the hike! They let us have our dog on the outside area that is beside the gates that define the resturant... Since they are doing remodeling they consider the restaurant/bar the patio area is the inside of the Resturant our dog couldnt be directly at our table.   They said the build out will be done in May..... Got busyas we were leaving. Only thing is they need more shade."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant on the water. Very relaxing. Good food too. Nice restaurant on Lake Pleasant. You get to watch boaters and life go by."}
{"text":"Horrible service unless you are white.  Our order came out after people that got here after us. Our orders were incorrect and fries were missing. Missing items that we ordered and were never brought out."}
{"text":"Took the boat here last weekend. Went up to bar and had a drink. Staff was friendly and good service. I will be coming back . Get the lobster grilled cheese."}
{"text":"We ended up at the newly opened Scorpion Bay Grill as we had been to the same location before to dine at Dillons and was surprised to find that it had a new name and a new menu.  Since we love eating on the water we decided to stay and take a chance.   As soon as we sat down our drink order was taken and so we were pleased with how quickly they arrived. As we looked at the menu the first thing we noticed was that the menu was very limited and had a small selection of food items that fit on a 1-page menu. That didn't bother me as both me and my husband like fish and we were thrilled to see the choices of entre salads included an Ahi Tuna Salad and a Shrimp salad with a good selection of ingredients.  My father chose the burger with fries.  It took a little while to get our food but we were pleased that our server checked in to let us know that it would be coming soon so we continued to sip on our drinks.  Then our food came and the disappointment began.  Our entre salads came in the size of a side salad bowl.  I was astonished because of the size and number of shrimp for the price that we were charged.  Since I was so shocked at the size of the salad bowls I looked around at other tables and noticed that appetizers were being served in similar shaped bowls that were larger than our salads.  Also, we never had the server check on our drinks or offer refills.  I am pleased to say that my father thoroughly enjoyed his burger and fries.  Once my father was finished eating, he had a lot more to eat than we did so we were finished first, we left the restaurant and my husband and I immediately went home and ate.  I have never left a restaurant feeling that the meals were so small that I had to go home and eat.  I would have given the restaurant 1 star in this review but I give it two stars as the restaurant very generously comp'd my fathers burger to thank him for his service exhibited by his World War II hat."}
{"text":"Have to say I had high hopes for this place. Went in on a Saturday afternoon with some friends for lunch. The service was the worst the appetizers came out before the drinks. The manager said they were busy. Thought of the day,  help. Food and drinks were expensive and low quality. This place is not a do over for our group."}
{"text":"A lovely 105 degree day at the Marina with no AC and fans spinning vigorously without creating any air movement whatsoever inside the restaurant. Over-the-top loud music that required yelling in order to communicate with the person sitting next to you and the acoustics of it was just making it even worse. As an appetizer, we had onion rings that came with sweet chili sauce and that was pretty decent to begin with. My S/O had the club sandwich with pasta salad. Really good portion size and good flavor, not skimping on the ingredients in the sandwich or the pasta salad side. His son had the fish and chips which also looked yummy and came with a boatload of fries and coleslaw and 2 huge chunks of battered fish. Sounds great so far, doesn't it? But the actual horror that came out of that kitchen, my \"salad\" as the main course literally threw me off so much that I genuinely could not find it in me to recommend this place to anyone, not even if it was the last place to go and get food at the lake. $14 Ahi Tuna Tartar - 3 unseasoned box chips, level one dry coleslaw, level 2 was about 2oz. of something that seemed like semi sushi grade tuna and finally on the 3rd level/chip were few red and yellow bell pepper shreds and black sesame seeds. All of this unseasoned (I really need to put emphasis on this), not marinated or tossed in some type of sauce/soy/whatever, thrown on a plate that was schmeared with some teriyaki reduction and a pretty pink flower and called a salad for $14. Literally the audacity of the price and this establishment to claim that this is a main course salad. I've never been more hungrier or angrier at a place. I think I should've protested immediately on the spot and have the dish returned and tell them they're being ridiculous, but you know, it's rude to be rude, right. Instead I am writing his Yelp review just so I can save the next life that wants to decide and order the Ahi Tuna Tartar and get epically disappointed. I think I'll just have some beers next time around."}
{"text":"We had the turkey burger. It's one of the best I've had. They make their own sauces. Yum. Our granddaughter, a very picky eater, even ate their flatbread.  They are in the middle of remodeling so when they are done the space will be awesome. As it was, we sat out on the deck with sails overhead. Need to come back here for sure!"}
{"text":"The view is spectacular!!!! You are I. The middle of the desert but surrounded by an oasis!  The food isn't bad, nothing special really. But you are spending time with friends and family that's priceless. They have great selection of beer and liquor. Their hostess is sweet and very helpful. I had their shrimp Cabo tacos, the shrimp is so tasty!!! I would recommend that! We are just in awe dining in on their patio with the view of the lake. I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"We had their dinner special of swordfish it was delicious.  View was wonderful too.  Was very noisy though."}
{"text":"We had a surprise 75th birthday luncheon at the Grill with 22 people attending. EVERYTHING was perfect. I had spoken with Matt prior to the date telling him how many would be attending. While they don't accept reservations, he suggested a time to arrive to have the best opportunity for group seating without much of a wait. There was no wait. Kristen had helped with ensuring appetizers would be brought to the tables while people were waiting for us to arrive. Our server, Brandi and another woman (so sorry I did not catch her name) were awesome. The food was perfect and everyone was served together. Even Dave who bused the table was great and joked with us. A perfect time for all. Highly recommend for any time you want great food, service, and a view to remember."}
{"text":"Went for the first time w friends from indiana whom were visiting us for the weekend.  Our waitress was great!  The food was very good and so were the drinks.  We love the outdoor patio and the atmosphere outside.  We will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"This place needs a little fine touches, like completing the interior, but the service staff was outstanding and the food was very good. We just had the cheeseburger sliders and they hit the spot as well as the battered french fries. Its worth the outing to have breakfast or lunch at the lake. Hopefully mgnt will install a large tv for the football season."}
{"text":"What can I say, not a fan of this restaurant.  Limited menu, with not much appeal.  Appears they are attempting to be hipster gourmet, which means expensive, and very small portions.  Ordered a riblet appetizer, the flavor of which was fine, but the ribs were incredibly tough, hard to get the limited meat off the bone, and mostly bone.  I know, ribs are be definition are mostly bone, but these riblets were no more than an inch long (literally), and I paid $9 for 5 of them.  I also ordered a flatbread, which was okay, the crust was undercooked.  Not much of a fan of the draft beer selection - again they appear to going hipster with craft beers - just not my style for drinkability at the lake.  I sincerely miss Dillions food, beer, bang for the buck, atmosphere, special events and entertainment.  Two stars:  one for location - anything at the lake is good.  One for the free Chex mix at the bar - otherwise you will leave hungry.  I hope this place comes around!"}
{"text":"So excited about the changes going on here! Have not been to this location since it was Dillon's Restaurant. Never very excited about Dillon's. Lots of indoor seating. Fun specialty drinks. Great, brand new menu with something for everyone. I had the quesadilla and my friend had the fish taco. We both felt the food is above average here. Attentive wait staff. Renovations are ongoing, but already much improved from Dillon's."}
{"text":"Loved the view of the lake as we ate! The service was great and the food was spectacular!! They had a nice local beer selection too!!"}
{"text":"Giving 2 stars because I have been here before and food is good.  But today, at 230 on a Monday we went for a late lunch, pay the $6 entry fee and make our way to the dock. Walk in, empty tables every where, but looked fairly crowded on the patio was told it would be a 45min wait?!  What the what?! Since the food is good but not stellar, we walked, not going to wait. 45 min for bar food. Hope they get it together because it's a peaceful spot"}
{"text":"Great new addition to the marina here at Lake Pleasant ! Started off at the bar taking in the relaxing view and courteous staff . Ordered the wings and the bacon flatbread . Both appetizers were so yummy! We really enjoyed the reggae music , fun vibe and great food ! So happy this place opened ! Makes the trip out to this beautiful spot a \" go to\" destination . We are planning our return visit to rent jet skis and cruise around the lake ."}
{"text":"I guess it's all you can expect from a dock restaurant but I expected more. We camped at the lake and on our third morning we decided to eat breakfast out. This place was closest so we tried it. Well I didn't expect much but I did expect my food to be eatable. I had the biscuit and bacon gravy.  stale or microwave biscuits came with toast? Why? No jelly for the toast. The gravy had some flavor but was lacking the creamy gravy like texture. I came back later to get something from the adjacent store. The shelves were void of anything but snacks and boat parts so I thought I'd get some side dishes from the grill. I ordered baked potatoes and potato salad, after being told that they did not have any baked potatoes. I ordered Mac n cheese (kraft) that was horrible, I had ordered the pasta salad but never got a chance to try it since I didn't get it. The potato salad was ok, I think it was Costco Potato salad. I'll just drive further next time."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a unique dining or bar experience, this is a great place for a cute date!  Located on the water it's VERY peaceful. The food is also very good as well! Decently priced considering it's location and service was great!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best food on the lake. I was told it was good and all, but I was very impressed with the quality and quantity of our lunch! We had a grilled chicken sandwich, a western burger, a turkey burger, and a Cobb salad. We were all very pleased!"}
{"text":"Food was good however the service sucked. Waitress took order & didn't see her after that. Had to actually get manager over to our table to get refills on drinks & condiments for our food. Will not be returning!!"}
{"text":"First of all, this was our very first time here. After purchasing 4 drinks and 2 big breakfast, we moved from our table to the lounge chair area to play jenga. There was no RSVP signs for the area, but we were rudely asked SEVERAL times whether we would order food or drinks. And they all had an attitude. It was either us ordering or basically we had to leave. I didn't know we could NOT stay around and drink and hang out? To even  be more terrible, we were the ONLY black and asian couple at the restaurant. Mind you we are very financially well off, and our clothes and appearance should speak for itself. I was really upset by the passive aggressive treatments we received from THREE different waitresses, who kept checking on us to see when we would leave. We were only at the restaurant for an hour too. The one star I left was for our actual waitress, she was sweet and polite."}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you love the view of the lake, delicious food, drinks and watching boats come in and out. Very relaxing, great menu options, the flat breads are delicious. Breakfast is awesome but I wish it was at least till noon for weekend  lazy birds like me. This is my new fav local place"}
{"text":"Well the tourist trap mentality has finally caught up with this place.  We came here 3 years ago it was half the size, no wait and $1 onion rings.  Best value ever.  Onion rings are now $4 and al the items are 12-15 dollars.  Food was good. Waiter was nice and overall great experience eating on a dock in the lake.   Great bloody Mary's and the drinks are not that expensive.  Overall above average and worth the drive.  Just wish it had stayed as it was a few years back but that's the price of progress."}
{"text":"What a great change of pace! Service from both servers was excellent. Very pleased with our food. My husband had a turkey burger while I had the Sonoran chicken salad. The best part was the view! Do not sit inside if the weather is nice! Eating while surrounded by the gorgeous Lake Pleasant was exactly what my husband and I needed for a relaxing day off!"}
