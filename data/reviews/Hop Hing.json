{"text":"Best Chinese takeout you can get outside of being downtown. They are so friendly and everything I have tried is always good(and I've tried alot). 

$5 lunch special too. Amazing.

Love."}
{"text":"This has been our favorite Chinese takeout for several years now. I'd love to give an elaborate review of the menu but I can't get past ordering the Lobster Lo Mein and Won Ton Soup to try anything else. :) I would like to know what others think of the restaurant, menu, staff, prices, etc. but my wife and I are quite satisfied and give a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Okay Chinese food general to chicken can be satisfied for many people it's like classical general Chinese food

Not pricey I would go there if I feel tired of hamburger"}
{"text":"Like most, I would say it's consistent. We ordered the Sesame chicken, general T' Sao s chicken, and lo mein. We also had an order of crab Rangoon.  The best Chinese in the area. That's for sure. We will be back"}
{"text":"I've been to Hop Hing 5 times in the past 6 weeks.  I've had 5 different dishes.  

Three of the dishes were top notch (General Tso's Chicken, Tai Chen Chicken and Moo Goo Gai Pan).  One was a combo meal and the other two were just the dish.  I really liked all of these.  The only downside is that the spice on the Tso and Tai Chen were not hot enough for me.  But there was plenty of food with all three.  I would definitely order again.

I also had the Roast Pork Szechuan Style.  The pork was not very good.  It was very dry and tough.  And there wasn't much pork in the dish.  The total quantity (less the pork) was great but the quality not so great.  I wouldn't order again.

The last dish was Shrimp w/Lobster Sauce.  The shrimp were big and plentiful.  But the the lobster sauce was lacking.  It reminded me of egg drop soup.  I've had much better lobster sauce.  So I had mixed feeling about this.  I wouldn't order this dish again but perhaps a different style shrimp would be okay.

I guess it depends on what dishes you like.  The chicken seems to be very well done.  Not sure I would order any pork dish again.  

Their service is usually very speedy, about 10 minutes from call to pick-up.  I would definitely recommend this place for Chinese food."}
{"text":"This is the best place around to get your fix of Chinese food..  Love it all and the lady that works here is great.  Knows you by your phone number.."}
{"text":"Can't complain about food because it's really inexpensive my first expression was far better than 3 stars I could give them 3.5 if I could but I found out its too sweet for me and somewhat I do not wanna go there anymore 

Can't beat for around 6 bucks for launch special with fried rice wanton soup and main dish it's definitely better than junk fast food"}
{"text":"Been going there on and off for 8yrs. Never had a problem till last visit. Ordered a bunch of food. My wife found part of a scouring pad in her dish. Crunchy she said. That's weird. And there it was a curly piece of steel.  Flat and sharp. Never again. I always over looked the general unkept appearance but I will never eat there again. Be careful."}
{"text":"Overall very good food. We have not eaten elsewhere yet but we think we will just stick with this place. Only thing is they didn't include the mustard and soy sauce so I you want some I would ask."}
{"text":"I have gone to Hop Hing about 5 times and my love of Hunan Beef has led me to only try that there but I am a huge fan!  I have tried my favorite dish at countless chinese restaurants and at Hop Hing the meat is tender (it's crazy at how many places serve you beef jerky-tough beef), flavorful and I have never came across fat or grissle.  The owners are nice and are welcoming.  A great place to go to grab some great chinese food that is moderately priced and full of flavor.  I pretty much only go there when I am on that side of town and one other place in Lakewood when I am in that area.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Food poisoning.  Yes, we are sure."}
{"text":"Definitely the best around!! Sesame chicken always done to perfection. And super fast service."}
{"text":"Honestly, nothing special; actually quite disappointing. If you're within driving distance of this place then spend a few more minutes to go to Kumo Seafood Buffet and enjoy a higher quality and broader spectrum of choice at a similar price point during lunch hours (obviously their dinner prices are on the more expensive side). I guess if you truly desire something Chinese-esque, and could really care less what you put in your mouth, then go for it. I won't deny, considering I am walking distance away, Hop Hing has filled me up a few times in a pinch, but I'm always left with more to be desired. The atmosphere is unprofessional, the food is often bland, and service is less than spectacular. It's just another typical Chinese takeout place, and maybe if they actually cared enough to bring their restaurant to a higher standard, they could be something special, but it's not. I really wanted to love this place, but the staff of Hop Hing obviously don't care enough to make that happen."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre. I do like that all the condiments/utensils are out you can help yourself. I asked for spicy and got bland. Veggies were well cooked. Too many peanuts in the dish though, very overwhelming. The fried dumplings were too doughy and the sauce was ehhh boring."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Hop Hing for more than ten years.  I always get the sesame chicken combo with pork fried rice and an egg roll.  Sometimes I will get a side of beef lo-mein or won ton soup.  
The sesame chicken always tastes fresh and you can tell it was fried to order opposed to sitting under a hot lamp or in a crock pot.  The chicken is good quality meat and generally there aren't any fatty or grissely pieces or any grotesquely large pieces.  The sauce is a standard sesame chicken sauce.  The egg rolls usually come steaming hot.  They are well sized crispy and tasty, sometimes I will order an extra one.  The beef lo-mein is very good.  It comes in larger portions and its always hot.  The beef pieces are good quality meat.  The won ton soup is good as well.

Great place to go to for quality chinese carryout."}
{"text":"Growing up in Royalton, this was really the only Chinese I've ever been exposed to. But as I've gotten older and expanded my Chinese food taste buds, nothing ever compares! Their egg and spring rolls are, by far, the best I've ever had and I'm never disappointed with my meals."}
{"text":"I just moved to the Broadview area, so I blindly picked Hop Hing to satisfy my Chinese craving! In my opinion, this is one of the best Chinese take out places that I've had. I got the chicken with garlic sauce (not spicy because imma huge baby) and it was very good, the chicken was very tender and there was a decent amount of sauce on the food! The rice was perfect as well in my opinion. 

There are a few tables inside but it seems like they primarily do takeout. Also they have a $10 credit card minimum (that I didn't know about but the woman kindly ran my card anyway) just so you know. 

Overall, I'm very happy with my food and the service!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here.  Everything has a a good flavor. General Tso's is my favorite dish.  Order a side of homemade mustard."}
{"text":"I must have gone to a different Hop Hing because I had a very different experience than the rest of the reviewers.  I won't say anything about the service or the restaurant's dining area (hint: there is none) because they were clearly slammed the night I went.  

I ordered about 8 different dishes for the family - everything from chicken and mushroom to egg drop soup.  After taking a family poll we all agreed it was not the worst Chinese food we've ever had, but it was definitely in the bottom 5.  If this was the \"best\" Chinese food in the area than I am seriously afraid that I won't find any good Chinese food.  

Each dish was \"bizarre\" in its own way.  The mushrooms in the chicken and mushrooms dish smelled... well, let's just say my wife wouldn't even mention the likeness at the dinner table.  The fried rice and sweet and sour pork reeked and tasted of very old oil.  The potstickers were about 80% doughy outside and 20% meaty inside.  I could go on, but I think you get the picture.

I would warn others to stay away, but having not tried other restaurants this might be the best you're going to get!"}
{"text":"Since I have moved to the area I have been disappointed with most of the food, especially the Chinese. I would literally drive to cleveland to get Chinese. 

Today I decided to be lazy and use yelp to try and find a place close to home. After reading some of the reviews, I decided to give Hop Hing a try.

I pull in and I am nervous, the place looks like a dirty dump from the outside. Still, I press on. I open the door to an old wind chime rigged to notify them I am here. I look around and wow! The place is actually clean, its the windows that make it uninviting.

I place my order and proceeded to wait. I looked around at the boxes and such stacked, wondering if they will ever get containers for the condiments. The kind gentleman hands me my good and I leave.

In the car I sneak a piece of the fried wonton. AMAZING! now I am actually excited to get home. Wonton soup, good! Chicken fried rice, Good. Sweet and sour chicken, over fried but good for the most part. I am to full to try the eggrolls but I am pleased and will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Food was not enjoyable. And then we found a hair. Yuk!  Will never eat here again. It's a shame that north Royalton doesn't have one decent Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"My go-to American Chinese food place now! My husband and I recently moved to North Royalton and this is the best around!!"}
{"text":"I don't frequent Chinese takeout like I used to, but when I do, it's gotta be Hop Hing. Good food. Their mushu pork is the best I've had anywhere. Service is super friendly as well. Not much else to say really, it's Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"No frills Chinese takeout joint which serves up the best I've had in the area. Lets face it - if you've lived in a big, cosmopolitan city like NY or San Fran, quality Asian food in Cleveland is few and far between (Pho Grand and Ty Fun aside), but this place holds it's own, and is my local takeout of choice."}
{"text":"-Different, But More Of The Same-

After the disappointments in spice and flavor from other Chinese food places nearby, I decided to give Hop Hing a chance. I have been struggling to find a Chinese food restaurant that makes spicy General Tso's Chicken, and zesty and flavorful Orange Chicken.

My girlfriend placed an order for pickup and we drove out to grab it. Hop Hing had our food ready to go as soon as we got there. The price of the food was actually one of the lowest among other Chinese food places we had tried in the area, this is a huge plus for me.

Upon arriving home, we opened up our food containers to discover that both dishes looked exactly the same, not a lot of vegetables or fruit zest to set them apart. We were able to slightly tell a difference from the little bits of orange that were in her box, and the fact that mine had next to nothing but chicken and sauce in it.

We dug in, and the verdict was that it just lacked flavor. Both dishes were extremely bland, and almost tasted the same. This restaurant fit into the exact same space as all the other Chinese take-out places that we have gone to.

The biggest difference that made this one stand out is that the rice was spectacular. It was light, the right amount of sticky, and perfectly cooked. The egg rolls were fantastic as well, not too crunchy, and not overly soggy. I will probably go to this Chinese place from now on, just because of the price and the sides. It just narrowly beats out the local competition."}
{"text":"Every time I eat at or get carry out from a chinese restaurant, I try their hot and sour soup, and Hop Hing has the BEST hot and sour soup. The owners of the place are very friendly and efficient. We usually get their mongolian beef, chow men fun, and general tso's chicken."}
{"text":"Oh I wanted to like Hop Hing so much!! I ordered Kung Boa chicken Extra Spicy!!! It was very mild. Like almost no flavor at all mild. I ordered cheese wontons and you gave me pork wontons. My wife ordered Garlic Chicken. It clearly has a red star on your menu - but was bland and flavorless. Aw nuts!!? Come on you guys!!! You have good reviews - why did my order suck so much? Do I have to order extra extra extra spicy to get flavor? Do we have to order something like curry chicken and hope that at least curry has some element of flavor? And is there literally no decent Chinese food in the Seven Hills / Broadview Heights / North Royalton area? I will give this place one more chance based on the other reviews. You gotta come through for me man! Flavor - look it up and serve it. Two stars and one more chance. Don't let us  down again. Please!!!"}
{"text":"We really like the General Tso's chicken from Hop Hing!  The sauce can be as spicy as you want and the broccoli is delicious.  We also like the chicken fried rice and the egg rolls.  The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW...food for days!  It's a nice local establishment that has really good food (and lots of it), at a good price with good customer service."}
{"text":"It's your standard Chinese take out place.

We had two chicken dishes: chow mein and sweet & sour.  I would give those entrees and our won ton soup 5 stars.

The egg rolls on the other hand were dripping with oil.  So bad we threw them out.  Disappointed as I consider the almighty egg roll the quintessential appetizer to kick off any delicious Chinese feast.  For that, I almost took two stars off, but realized it was a busy Saturday night.  Mistakes happen.

Otherwise, very busy.  Very friendly employees.  We'll give them another chance."}
{"text":"Normally, I would give Hop Hing a high rating.  However, last time I ordered take out,  it came with a piece of metal brush used for cleaning with my beef and broccoli.  Had potential to be a disaster.  Called to let them know and they were not phased by it and didn't seem to care.  Won't hurry back"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for chinese take-out food!

I was impressed by how it tasted a little less \"MSG\" than a typical Chinese spot.

Even the Crab Ragoon was delicious...and they remembered the sweet and sour sauce (a real pet peeve of mine is to get home and only have duck sauce..ewww)

I'll absolutely go back."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of their general tso's!!! Fast service and I like that all the condiments are open and available while waiting for your order"}
