{"text":"Best service every time and the most frictions food I ever had! I find myself going back although it's pricy because the food and service is always amazing! Great place to take ur date!"}
{"text":"Our appetizer salads were delicious and the ahi tuna was flavorful and seared just right. The filet and ribeye were cooked perfectly (very juicy and pink but also cooked at 500 degrees). The deserts were a knockout due to the house-made dark chocolate.  We had a large party and were pleasantly surprised that we were seated in a private room. The space and the staff made our celebration absolutely perfect. However, here are my complaints:  The vegetables, such as the broccoli and the asparagus, were NOT fresh. They were certainly frozen and then cooked. Many other nearby restaurants offer locally grown, fresh vegetables on their menus.  The menu is not friendly for those with gluten or dairy issues. And forget it if you're vegan.   The prices are not propionate to the quality. When it comes to the beef, they nailed it, but everything else on the menu does not live up to the price tag. You could go to Spoon or Altius and pay less for amazing atmosphere AND everything is delicious."}
{"text":"Poor, slow service. Steak was over cooked and the plate was hot but not \"sizzling\". We were greeted by no less than 3 servers who all said they were working \"as a team\".  After that, we did not receive a visit from anybody for 20 minutes.  Finally, one of three arrived to immediately \"take our order\". Our salads were then seemingly immediately delivered.  Before we finished our salads a fourth server asked if we were ready for our main course.  I said no, not yet which was probably a mistake.  I have no doubt our steaks sat under a heat lamp. Our wine was not delivered until after our steaks arrived.  Yes, it might seem like a trivial critique but when your meal is nearly $100/person it's legitimate.  We have been to Ruth's Chris all over the country and our experiences vary wildly but have trended downward. This experience was the \"final straw\".  We will never return to a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Ruth Chris Steakhouse is by far one of the best restaurants I've been to in Pittsburgh. Ironically, my family and I avoid eating red meats whenever possible, which seems awkward when dining at a renowned steakhouse. That being said, no red meat platters were placed in front of us.  The service here is impeccable. The waiters are amazingly helpful, poised, and polite.   The food we ordered arrived fairly quickly. I got the lobster mac 'n' cheese, my dad ordered chicken, my sister got medium rare fish, my mom ordered a salad, and as sides we all ordered cream spinach and mashed potatoes with garlic. All the foods were flavorful and seasoned and prepared perfectly.   As we moved onto dessert, the choices were hard because everything sounded extremely delectable. I got the Chocolate Sin Cake, which the espresso and chocolate mixed together was mouth-watering. My sister ordered the Strawberries and Cream. The strawberries tasted fresh and sweet. My parents split an amazingly tempting apple cobbler served warm with vanilla ice cream and overflowing with delicious apples"}
{"text":"Expensive, but delicious. Ala carte style restaurant. Sides delicious as the entree. Dessert were great too!"}
{"text":"I went here with my family last night to celebrate my 17th birthday. The staff was extremely kind and our server, Russ was excellent. My mother and I both ordered the ribeye steak and my father had the salmon. I was torn between getting the lamb chops and the ribeye, in the end I chose the ribeye. For sides we ordered sautéed mushrooms and au gratin potatoes. The sides (and the meals) are huge so share sides with everyone at the table! Everything came out beautifully. My mother's steak however came out medium rare instead of medium well, but Russ sent it back to the kitchen and had it cooked to perfection and even brought out another plate of mushrooms. We couldn't leave without dessert, so my mom ordered chocolate mousse, my father, cherry cobbler and I had creme brûlée. I read so many reviews on Yelp about how the amazing the creme brûlée was and it did not disappoint!!!! Everything was absolutely perfect and I cannot wait to visit again :)"}
{"text":"Wow.  How far we have fallen.  This place used to be THE best steaks in town.  Went here last night for a friends birthday.  Our bill was over $400.  Tip was $120.  We are all in the business.  What a disappointment.  Mine and my buddies $52 ribeye were med well to well done after ordering it medium.  We don't complain, we just eat it.  The lobster mac had 3 pieces of lobster in it with some melted cheese on top of Kraft Mac noodles.  $22!!!  Really??  Service was OK.  I get it, it was a Tuesday night, but charging this much and not getting anywhere close on delivery is a shame.  We counted 32 covers last night from 730-945 when we left.  With quality and service down I'm not surprised.  With 55 years experience between the four of us in the business and owning 2 establishments in Pittsburgh, we were very dissatisfied.  This is the \"service\" industry and you missed the mark tonight.  Sorry Ruths Chris, I work Wed-Sat nights and the only time we get to go out is Sun-Tue and if this is the best you have to offer, you need to step up your game even if it is an \"off\" night."}
{"text":"Best steak we've ever enjoyed.  Service is impeccable and attentive.  A little pricey but worth every penny spent.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Oldies are dying fast in the burgh. In order to keep up with the times, these classics just don't pass for the high end classy place to go anymore.   I ordered the special which was a sea bass. My cousin ordered the same but her portion was easily double mine. Plus they have the worst presentation ever!!!!!! How can you send out just a piece of fish or steak on a plate. I get the whole family style but a small mini plate with my fish on it is just depressing.   Think of it... If you own a restaurant what is your ultimate goal. Have the customer remember the meal, right? Well when someone serves me a tiny portion of fish for $38... There is nothing worth remembering but how lonely my fish was on the plate.   Oh yeah I had to eat my asparagus off a side plate. The asparagus was twice the size of the plate. Really....  The wife had a steak. The plate was 100 degrees and the oil was bubbling on the plate. They clearly used too much oil and did not let the meat rest. Cause when she was done the plate was a grosssssss oily bloody mess.   The severs need some basic training. Serve from the left and clear from the right!!!! Basics.... Come on. I expect these things from a high end place.   Never going back!"}
{"text":"Very big price tags but for the good food, great cocktails, and super attentive waitstaff, you're getting what you pay for.  Visited for the first time with my husband to celebrate my birthday. We had a reservation that was close to the opening time so when we first got there the place was empty. By the time we were taking our check the place was packed.  We ordered a ton of food. We started off with the seared Ahi tuna appetizer and cocktails. He had the kumato tomato salad and the New York strip with a dipping sauce trio and mashed potatoes. I had the ribeye with a bleu cheese crust, lobster tail, and roasted Brussel sprouts. We topped everything off with a creme brulee and a molten lava cake.  The sauce with the tuna was spicy and refreshing and I can't place what was on the cucumber salad that came with it but it was a delightful palette cleanser. The cocktails were strong and fabulous. My ribeye was so tender I didn't even have to use a knife and my lobster was ridiculously fluffy. The Brussel sprouts and cake weren't overly memorable, I probably wouldn't get them again on a revisit.  The food was delicious and the portions are very generous but don't be fooled, you're paying for \"a classy experience,\" being treated like royalty. The waitstaff was very well trained, professional, and conscientious of every detail.  Once the wallet has some time to heal, we'd love to visit again."}
{"text":"ok I am trying to catch up on my reviews and since coming back from vaca in great SF and I have jetlag with nothing else to at the moment, I am trying to do just that. My husband and I have eaten at RCSH over the years and with each visit the service has gotten increasingly worse! The food is wonderful as always but really with our dinners averaging 200 plus tip I believe the service should be topnotch. What happened RC???? WE LOVE your food but can't justify the prices with service so bad. We should not have to keep looking around for our waiter for a drink refill and we told numerous times we would like bread with our meal and when we brought it up to him, his reply was, \"oh the bread is done yet\" and no reply about the drinks...sad...too busy talking with the other staff(this did happen last October, before the Yo-yo Ma concert we attended) Hey, maybe they have improved..but ah we are not taking anymore chances with this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here to celebrate an early Valentine's Day.  We rarely eat out at expensive restaurants.  The wine selection was very good.  Like many restaurants, you're paying 3x-4x retail prices.  The service staff was very friendly, as you would expect for a restaurant like this one.  My wife wanted something changed on one of their plates and they seemed particularly inflexible.  I thought it odd considering how much we were paying.  The scallop appetizer was very good.  $15 for three very tasty scallops.  The vegetarian platter was also very good and the petit filet + blackened shrimp was excellent.  I thought the filet was a little crustier on the outside than I like.  It was cooked the way I ordered it: medium rare; I just thought the outside was a little more cooked than I usually like.  No dessert for us."}
{"text":"I wavered between 4 and 5 stars here. If the rating was strictly based on food, I'd go with 5, easily. But, it's based on service, too, which is why I had to knock one off. Here's the deal...  I love Morton's. Its old-school interior and no-gimmicks shtick is awesome. Plus, of course, the food is fantastic. However, I wanted to branch out, and Ruth's Chris had some great reviews, so I utilized Yelp's oh-so-convenient Open Table reservation feature, and scored a table for two on a Saturday night.   Our reservation was for 8:30. We arrived right on the dot, but were told to go to the bar and wait. So, my boyfriend and I both got cocktails -- he had Glenlivet, which is obvs hard to mess up, and I got the Peachy Pear-tini, which was delish. And then, we waited. And waited. Around 9, our table was ready.   Our waitress was Kristen, and she was fantastic. Very attentive, friendly, witty, and knowledgeable about the food. Here's our food rundown:  - Barbequed shrimp app: I initially thought was BBQ sauce + shrimp, but it ain't. It's succulent li'l shrimp in a deliciously garlicky, white wine-infused sauce with a cayenne kick. Kristen suggested that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were gone, and we happily took her up on that.   -Ruth's chopped salad: Holy crap. The most memorable salad of my life. I rarely rave about salads. In fact, I think this is the first time I ever have in my life. But, this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top, hearts of palm (which I love), and this amazing lemon-basil dressing, among other delicious things. So awesome.  - Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter, he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton's. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li'l too generous, and he wound up scraping some off, but still enjoyed it.  - Broccoli au gratin: Again, phenomenal. I've never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted, it was swimming in bubbling, gooey cheese...  - Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here, as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes, and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But, it paid off big-time. These were, hands-down, the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela's has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.  So, based on that experience, we went back again the next Saturday. Different waitress, same food (literally, we ordered exactly the same items, 'cause they were so damn good). I don't remember the waitress' name that we had the second time, but we waited longer for food to appear, were checked on far less, she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before I'd gotten to pour it in my glass, our steaks were not done correctly (he got my medium-rare, I got his medium-well), and it took forever to get the check. I really think it ruins the experience when you're done eating and ready to go, and you're just sitting there, drumming your fingers, looking around the dining room and wondering, \"Where the hell is the waitress with our check?\"   That said, we will definitely be back. We'll just request to be seated in Kristen's section! :)"}
{"text":"Best steak in Pittsburgh!! La Mont, Capital Grille and Morton's do not compare! I have tried them on all there steaks are too dry not the same"}
{"text":"This place has mouth watering steaks, unbelievable wine choices and impeccable service. I can not wait to go back."}
{"text":"BEST STEAK I'VE EVER HAD. Of course I got the filet with a blue cheese crust with sides of au gratin potatoes and asparagus. Absolutely delicious.  This is what steak is supposed to be!"}
{"text":"Apparently I wasn't important enough with my lunch burger order (even though it was $16.95...) because my server did not come back to see if it was cooked medium, which it certainly was NOT. When I FINALLY got a chance to ask about it, she acted indignant that I would question her then checked her pad, yes, I ordered medium. Then she stared at me. Stared.   I have to say, I have never felt smaller in any restaurant experience in my life. Extremely disappointing and appalling. Will give our business to Capital Grille from now on. I urge you to do the same."}
{"text":"I love lamb chops! The dinner service was great. Very well presented. We were here for valentine's and we truly enjoyed ourselves. It was romantic :)"}
{"text":"During a pre-Penguins game dinner around 5:00pm on a Thursday, we dined with another couple.  The place was completely empty.  The two hostesses were nice enough.  The waitress seemed preoccupied, and just didn't deliver the service that you'd expect from this high-end chain.  The food was good to very good, and no one went away disappointed.  The lobster bisque and crabtini were delicious.  All the sides were good, especially the mashed sweet potatoes.  They were almost like a dessert.  Bone-in ribeye and filet were good --- although someone (server? kitchen?) reversed the cook on two filets and the associated toppings.  They apologized, switched the plates, and just assumed everything would be ok.  It wasn't and steaks had to go back.  Because of the high dollar value meal, I would have expected better from them!  I really like Ruth's Chris, but they have to step up their service!  ESPECIALLY when the restaurant isn't busy!"}
{"text":"A group of 10 of us had dinner here. Excellent service. My filet was perfect and came out cooked as ordered. The broccoli was cold or got cold fast, not sure which. My martini was also perfect and served with a shaker with extra that they put on the table. This place is great for large groups. I joined late and they integrated me into the flow seamlessly."}
{"text":"The steaks here never disappoint! Staff was very friendly and made us feel welcome.  Come here for the steak. The fish is good but the steaks are phenomenal.  This is a high end restaurant that knows how to cook steaks. When ordering make sure you order your steak how it should be cooked. A medium at a normal restaurant might seem a little raw here. That being said, plate comes out very hot so you can cook it a bit more if you need  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Employees were all working hard very nice and conversational.  My family and I enjoyed celebrating my birthday here over the weekend"}
{"text":"great food and atmosphere.  vet busy so noise was a bit annoying but service and food was exceptional.  i would of given 5 star were it not for the noise level."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris Steak House never fails to deliver-- its also right by the ice rink and Christmas tree so you can check that out while waiting for a table! Service is incredible. Waitress was super attentive. I was super thrilled to head downtown for a break from the hustle and bustle for a night of steak, beers, whiskey, lobster mac and cheese, and potatos of some form.   I have given up red meat as a result of a recent health-care related scare, so I opted for the lobster mac and cheese, and a side of the potatos au gratin to bring home for a friend to sample. My friend's (lets call him Sam) rib-eye was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and my friend Zeke who is vegan (I don't know why we invited him) ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna. I tried some of this and it was some of the best Seared Ahi Tuna I have ever eaten. It came sitting atop a bed of colorful veggies! Idk what veggies they were but damn sis. They were thicc!   The night was going great.  My only complaint, is that the potatos that I was so excited about, were unfortunately burned while the staff was making them in the kitchen. My friend Zeke and I had some really pressing plans afterward and we had already waited a long time for the food, so waiting for more potatos was not an option. I opted to remove the potatos from the check. I was so thankful that I wasn't charged for the burned potatos. Thank you to the entire staff of Ruth's Chris, especially the waitress who removed the potatos from the check!  If anybody knows how good the potatos from Ruth's Chris Steak House taste, please let me know so I can update this yelp review to make it more accurate to the culinary/food quality element of Ruth's Chris... Thanks in advance and thanks again to the staff at Ruths Chris---"}
{"text":"The food and service is excellent. But I object to being asked repeatedly about whether we were celebrating a birthday. We both dislike pubic displays that include singing and clapping by the waitstaff.   When we made our reservation was asked if it was a birthday or special occasion. We were asked four more times: when they called to confirm, by the hostess, by two wait persons. I assumed this information should be passed along. When the meal was finished, the waiter (no. 2, first waiter never appeared again at our table but was still working in the room) asked about dessert. We said we were told it was included. He acted so surprised because no one told him it was a birthday ! I think Ruth Chris should simply say they have a complimentary dessert but stop ASKING if it is a special occasion"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal from the moment you walk in the door until the moment you finish your leftovers the day after your dinner.  Let me start with the atmosphere: don't go dressed like a bum because you'll embarrass yourself and everyone else there, but I highly doubt you would be asked to leave based on your attire.  Jeans and a golf shirt is fine, but so is a suit and tie.  The restaurant can accommodate almost any attire.  The drinks are expensive but who cares because the food is in a category near its own towards the top of the proverbial mountain.  I am told that the menu includes entrees besides steak, but I have no foggy idea why anyone would go to this restaurant and not order a cut of its world class, corn-fed beef.  I had the porterhouse and I have serious doubts that I could enjoy a steak more than I did that RC cut.  Our server, Christian, only added to the experience by providing us with a welcomed sense of humor and a knowledge of the different menu options that bordered on scholarly.  Yes, you will pay 3 times more for a steak here than you will at your local chain restaurant, but you will also be eating a steak that tastes at least 5 times better than what you're used to ordering.  Go here.  Go hungry.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"As early 90's rapper Tone-Loc once said \"Let's do it.\"  Unless you have spent your first 20 years or so in a subterranean nuclear fall out bunker, odds are you know of Ruth's Chris. The legendary steakhouse is supposedly the final word in steak outside of NYC and Texas. If this is the case then my oh my how the mighty have fallen. I have been to several Ruth's Chris locations around the PA, NY, and NJ area, but the one here in Market Square is truly a disappointment.   When I go to a real steakhouse, like Peter Luger's, or the Old Homestead, or any other Ruth's Chris location I have visited, I expect to pay top dollar for top dollar steaks. I will never complain about the price so long as I feel as if the quality and quantity of food as well as the dining experience I recieve is fair in proportion to what I pay. The cheapest steak in the M2 Ruth's Chris will run you about thirty dollars. Normally, this would not be a problem had the establishment lived up to its reputation. Sadly, however, they did not.  First, let's start with the decor. Ruth's Chris is a chain, first and foremost. That being said all locations are going to have the same basic look: old wood, magnum wine bottles, white tableclothes and red walls. I expect this sort of thing in a steakhouse. They are the last holdouts from the old industrial capitalist era. I feel as if I were to walk in, I might see Andrew Carneghie or John Rockefeller sitting at the bar discussing how unffair anti-trust legislation is.  Continuing with the bar, Ruth's Chris offers a fantastic wine selection that has a pleasant mixture of affordable, yet quality, choices as well as a few that would cost me six months' rent. They also have a decent coctail menu, no doubt created by a corporate mixologist, that I must say is good. My girlfriend is not a fan because she can actually taste the alcohol in the majority of the concoctions, but I think that is a good thing. The bar is about the only place where you get the quality for the money you are spending.  The most dissappointing aspect about my last few visits have been the steaks. Ruth's Chris is known for basting their steaks in butter, which I do like. Fat is deliscious and that is proof enough for me that we are meant to eat it. This is where the goodness ends. On my second to last visit, a member of my party was served a rancid steak. The server tried to say it was dry-aged, but dry-aging does not produce a metallic, green beef. On my most recent visit, I was served a filet mignon that was tough. I have no idea how they were able to serve a tough portion of the least used muscle on the cow, but they did.  All of this brings me back to the service. I understand you are working in a fine dining, expensive steakhouse. I get that you throw down $300 plust dollar checks thirty or so times a night. I get that you are on first name basis with the Pens, Bucs, and Steelers that call themselves your regulars. That does not make me chop liver. I feel that if you are not wearing at least $3,000 worth of clothes or accessories, the staff will basically ignore you.  The saving grace to the place would be the bar and decor I already mentioned, and the sides. Ruth's Chris, like most fine dining establishments runs an a la carte menu. The sides are usually very very good. I like the sauteed mushrooms, sauteed spinache, lyonaise potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and the wedge salad.  All in all, this place gets a two in my book. I think that this is kind of sad given the fact that I was hoping to give them a five, but the quality of the food compared to what you pay just is not up to standard. For $250 I can feed and booze six friends at my house instead of me and my girlfriend at Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"We only go to fancy steak places for very special occasions.  This time was no different and I do love splurging on a good steak. They have no draft beers and pretty crappy bottle selection. Ok I get it they want you to order expensive wine. Well I like beer with my steak and went with the classic Penn Pilsner. My fiancée got a Stella. The entrees are served by themselves with sides family style. Not a fan of that as we like totally different things. I was glad to see they had a summer special that was a great deal. For $44 you got to pick from 4 appetizers, 4 entrees, choose one of 3 sides and the dessert of the evening. I started with the steaks house salad which came with tomatoes and onions. I went with blue cheese dressing which was amazing- seemed to be homemade. For my entree I got the petite 6oz filet which came with 2 grilled shrimp. I choose the mashed potatoes as my side which are so creamy. The steaks are served on very hot plates so they continue cooking while you eat. I am not sure that is necessary and leaves you with a burning plate so watch out! The meat is fabulous and cooked to perfection as it should be. Our dessert was up next which was a chocolate fudge tort with whipped cream and berries and cream on the side- decadent is all I have to say. Our service was fantastic and we were served our entrees very quickly. Free parking in the garage underneath the restaurant."}
{"text":"Really good steaks! The porter house is to die for! Something about cooking a steak in butter! Paula Deen would be proud! The location could be better. With all the new construction of new condos and office buildings going up now would be a great time to move! Was my favorite until Hyde Park came to town. Really good service and drinks!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation and was sat promptly. I felt a little like royalty with the amount of attentiveness shown by the staff. The portions are huuuge and beyond amazing! This place is a little on the expensive side but this is definitely a case of.. you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Since I've lived in Pittsburgh, I've been here around 15 times at the food NEVER falls short.  The other reviews are spot on.  This is the best steak you will get in the city.  There are some shortfalls that only move the rating down to probably a 4.6.  The atmosphere is a little stuffy.  It's good for business but maybe not for pleasure as much.  The lighting is too bright.  For that reason, it loses some of the romance in my eyes. But all it all this place is SOLID.  Everything on that menu is 5 stars.  (Believe me, I've tried them all)"}
{"text":"Good steak if you don't get out much.  Not nearly as good as the price would lead you to believe.  Ruth's Chris will never be a Morton's or a Gibson's.  While Pittsburgh does not have a Gibson's, you should really go to Morton's.    The atmosphere is alright, the drinks moderately stiff, and the salad was great...  But one is supposed to come here for steak.   Regrettably, my last two trips (I wasn't paying... hence why I went back) gave me a piece of beef like my late grandma would cook in her oven's broiler with butter.  For a $50 strip, I would expect it to be more like the hand cut, unfrozed meat I make for my grilling parties.  As such, I would rather fire my grill up in December than give Ruth's Chris more money for mediocrity.  Good Talk."}
{"text":"We have celebrated birthdays at Ruths Chris Steak House for years, but after our experience this year, we may be searching for another option. We met my son and his girlfriend for his birthday at the end of December. We were glad to see the renovations as the restaurant looked more open and inviting than it used to. But from that first impression, the evening went downhill. The place wasn't very busy for a night in December, which was alittle surprising.  My son's girlfriend ordered a filet - medium rare. When the meal was delivered, the steak was well done. Ok..a mistake and the server said another one would be brought out shortly. She waited while we began to eat our meal. Several minutes later, another steak was delivered...again over cooked. We again sent it back and were assured that shortly another steak would be brought out. By this time, the rest of us were half done with our meal. Finally, a third steak was delivered....it was Blood Rare! When we again called the server over, she agreed it was not cooked as requested and  a manager came to the table. He suggested that they bring out a hot plate to continue cooking the steak at the table. Now I can understand one mistake at a high end restaurant like Ruths but three times a steak is brought out wrong at a Steakhouse! It surely put a damper on our evening celebration as she just ate the side dishes and ended up taking the last steak home to finish cooking it there. Our bill was well over $400.00 and I left there feeling very bad. The next day I sent a letter to Customer Service on their website and never received a call or email back. Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"Although it's pricey, the food is definitely worth it.  My husband and I try to go here once or twice a year, either with a group or just the two of us.  We have never had a bad experience.    When we go here, we go all in - drinks, appetizers, desserts, all of it.  The crab cakes are delicious, as are the scallops they sometimes serve.  I am not even a steak person and hardly ever eat it, but I crave steak from Ruth's Chris because it is just that good.  I usually go for the petite filet, which they always cook to perfection.  If you love sweet things like I do, the sweet potato casserole is the best dinner side they have.  The desserts never disappoint either, I've tried almost all of them!  Yes it is very formal and what you would expect out of an older \"men's club\" steakhouse.  But hey, if I'm spending this kind of money, I want to be in a nice restaurant with excellent service!  They even come by and scrape the crumbs off your table in between dinner and dessert, no joke."}
{"text":"So I didn't know what to expect going to this place because I'm not much of a fine diner. But every year for Christmas, my family chooses a nice restaurant to simply eat, drink, and enjoy each other's company during the hectic holidays. My dad had a gift card for Ruth's from when he retired almost 3 years ago, and said he was saving it for a time we could all go. Well, this Christmas was it!  We were seated promptly at our reservation time and all ordered drinks and cocktails. As I opened the menu, the prices were about what I expected based upon what I've heard. Now I like a good steak, but I can also say I feel like I've never really had a bad steak out, so I'm not too picky. I was wondering to myself if paying triple what I'd typically pay for a steak was going to make a difference to me taste-wise, but I was blown away when mine came. I got the 6 oz filet cooked medium with shrimp. I've never eaten a steak without steak sauce or mushrooms or onions, something to add more flavor. This steak was so. Damn. Flavorful. It's obviously a combination of the cooking it in a thousand some degree oven, as the waitress explained to us, and the mass amounts of butter that I'm sure was applied and soaked in  during different times of cooking. Wow. The smell alone was amazing as it wafted around our table. They should make a candle! (That would actually be weird and you'd be salivating at random in your home. ) Every bite was so melt in your mouth good I really couldn't believe it.   Nearly everyone at our table got the Ruth's Chris classic meals, which were priced for either $48 or $55 depending what you got. They all came with either a soup or salad, one side, and dessert. I was really surprised to see these options on the menu, because we were preparing to spend almost double a person of we all ordered a steak and side. This was a great choice to try a little bit of everything on the menu without going overboard in the money department. I got broccolini as my side, with a salad beforehand and the dessert was a mini apple cheesecake tart with ice cream. I really can't express enough how delicious it all was, but especially that perfectly cooked filet.   The staff was great and very attentive while also answering all of our questions since we'd never dined there before. Definitely a great place to go for a special occasion in the future."}
{"text":"This wasn't my first trip to a Ruth's Chris, but my first to this Ruth's Chris. This Ruth's didn't let me down, as it was right up there with every other Ruth's I've been to.  My filet mignon came out cooked perfectly medium rare- and I have to say I've never had that messed up on me at a Ruth's- with the flavor you expect from them. It's one of my favorite steaks with the crumbled bleu cheese coating it.  I had the pleasure of meeting the owner and his wife while I was there, and they seemed like such great people. Their visit definitely made the trip a little more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I was here just recently for a wedding engagement party and the food was exceptional my steak was done just the way i ordered it. The wine was pretty good and i am not a wine drinker and actually liked the red they served. I would say i would come again."}

Having said that, we knew it was going to be expensive, and didn't care.  We wanted to try it. I usually prefer steaks from Brazil or Argentinian restaurants as they are the best. But in Pittsburgh... those types of restaurants are a rare find.   The steak was extremely good! I'm not totally sure if it was great value for money, but having said that, nothing was left on my plate! So I can't complain! And the restaurant is located in my favourite skyscraper! So I got to take photos of my favourite building on my holiday visit to Pittsburgh!  So my final words... are YUM!"}
{"text":"my fiance and i went here during our parent's get away for dinner on a friday night.  I've been to many a high priced steakhouse, and knew you get what you pay for at most places like these.  however my man, has not.  When he saw the pricing, he was flabbergasted.  i explained (and hoped!!!) he would not be disappointed, in the service, drinks, or food!  Thankfully they proved him wrong.  We decided to share a large steak, which the back waiter cut for us and served on 2 plates, a wedge salad, au gratin potatoes, asparagus with hollandaise and dessert to go.  After a couple of delectable cocktails, he loosened up about how much $ we were blowing, and enjoyed each and every course!  They were very busy, but everything was great.   all in all we specnt about $150 including tip and sharing the steak was a good call bc we left full!"}
{"text":"Good food, drinks, and service, but at these prices I expect something extraordinary...and it wasn't. My medium rare steak was over cooked. Everything was good. But at these prices there are better choices"}
{"text":"Great Steaks, Wonderful Staff!!!!  Can't wait to go back.  The entire experience was delightful.  By far, the best steak that I have ever had."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here for our 6 month anniversary dinner for a nice night out. I had been here several times before but she had not. As per past experience it was a very nice experience with a good wait staff, and wonderful food. As usual I managed to devour every bit of my t-bone. When asked ifnwe were going to have dessert we declined as we decided to go to our favorite dessert place. We were pleasantly surprised when our waitress retrned with a plate which had strawberries and whipped cream, and happy anniversary written in chocolate! Needless to say that was quite wonderfully sweet in a few ways! All in all we will be dining here again."}
{"text":"This is the third Ruth Chris I've been to. The steak was delicious as usual, but the service and overall atmosphere was a little off.   The other locations I've visited have been located in casinos and I have to say they are more laid back and comfortable. You didn't feel like you had to whisper to your dinner mates.   The only food complaint I have is that the asparagus was very large and barely warm. But luckily the bread and potatoes were more than enough to go with my steak.   Parking here is free if you can find the lot. There was no mention of the parking online or when I made the reservation. So we paid for parking and had to walk a few blocks."}
{"text":"Top notch experience here! Super excellent steak quality, flavor, temperature tenderness...my mouth is watering just thinking about it. All of the sides were uber delicious. An unexpected surprise was the scalloped potatoes which were fabulous. The service was also exceptional...felt special from beginning to end. Complimentary garage parking nearby was also really awesome (yes, I really dont think customers should pay for parking in general). I can't think of one thing that was off. What a perfectly memorable experience!"}
{"text":"First time for me.  The calamari was very good. My Ribeye was overcooked dry and bland. Her filet was very undercooked and bland.  We both ordered medium-rare, mine had no color at all and hers was cold and purple. Salt and pepper helped the flavor.  What restaurant in the world does not salt a steak before cooking?  The baked potato was good. The brussel sprouts were OK.  Not even close to worth $200."}
{"text":"Always amazing! My Husband and I frequent Ruth's Chris for almost every special-occasion: birthdays, anniversaries, when we need a great meal; and without fail we leave euphoric.   After almost each bite, we close our eyes to shut-out the sense of sight to focus on the taste and aroma of the garlicky, creaminess of the Remoulade on our salads; the richness of the Pesto on our Sea Scallops; the buttery-goodness of our dry-aged steak; and the salty crunch of our French Fries, which Kathy suggested we dip into Honey-mustard for a fantastic salty-sweet combination.  Friday is a good reason to go... Reservations are calling!"}
{"text":"We decided to enjoy a Saturday night dinner at Ruth Chris for my wife Denise's and my sis Leah's birthdays. The meal was awesome, the service was great and the overall experience with my family and daughters there could not have been better.   I tried to grab a bunch of pictures but you will see I had the New York Strip, the W and I each got different salads and shared w our girls, the table got 4 different appetizers, 5 different side dishes, and a bunch of desserts. We did plow through some bottles of Robert Mondavi merlot.   I think this is a wonderful stop and they went above and beyond to make the kids happy too. They don't rush you and let you savor a great meal."}
{"text":"We went last night with a group of 5 for my brothers birthday. We ordered a bottle wine, appetizers, salads, and a lot of steak and lobster. Now I must say, my steak and lobster was delicious and cooked perfectly we did have a few mishaps here. My brothers girlfriend ordered the filet and it was brought to the table. She ordered medium rare. She cut into it and it was well done. The waitress came over asked if everything was ok, and she said no and showed her the steak. She was like oh that's nowhere close to medium rare and grabbed it and took it back. As we were all eating she waited. Another steak comes out and the waitress walked away. My brothers girlfriend cuts into it once again and once again it was WELL DONE! So the manager walked by and I grabbed him and my brothers girlfriend explained what happened once again and grabbed the steak. So we all continued to eat while she just ate the sides we ordered. Now her THIRD filet came out and the manager himself delivered it. He asked her to cut into the steak and she did. It was just seared, it was as rare as rare could be. I'm pretty sure it was still mooing. At this point everyone was done with their food and she was just getting hers. The only thing he said was I could bring out another really hot plate and it can cook a bit more on there. Now I don't understand how a nation wide chain that is known for their steaks can get 3 of their most popular dish wrong. You think they would have it down to a science. The bill comes and it was $460 for the 5 of us and they took her filet off. She didn't get to eat with us during a celebration dinner and they only comped a 60$ steak? At least comp a bottle of wine or some of the beers. That just wasn't right. Next time I go to another steakhouse for a delicious dinner I'll just go back to my usual, Capital Grille. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"We have always loved celebrating at Ruths Chris- typically their steaks are perfectly prepared and the service is excellent. Recently the quality has significantly declined! We celebrated a birthday with a small group of friends, some of which had never been to Ruths Chris before, and the food was horrendous. Not only did it take forever, the steaks came out ridiculously overdone. Not just one steak, but every single steak ordered was completely overdone! And worse yet, the wait staff did not seem to be phased at all.  If you are looking to celebrate an important evening, I wouldnt bet on Ruths Chris any longer!"}
{"text":"Finally I can shut all of those \"you've never been to Ruth's Chris!?\" people up, haha! My boss got me a gift card for Ruth's for Christmas and my boyfriend and I decided to use it on Valentine's Day. I easily got a reservation about 2 weeks in advance and we were promptly seated at a cute corner table as soon as we arrived.  Our waiter, Christian, was excellent and attentive.  He gave us a quick rundown of the specials and Lee and I both decided on Ruth's Surf & Turf: a 12oz ribeye with 2 lobster tails for just $65.  Compared to most of the other steaks on the menu, this deal was too good to pass up! We also elected to start with a dozen oysters and ordered the creamed spinach and a loaded baked potato for our sides.  The oysters were fantastic, though I've never met an oyster I didn't like, but they ran us $3 each.  A dozen may have been a bit bold as our appetizer course alone rang in at $36!  But at least they were delicious.  Next, our steaks came out.  A nice young gentleman served us our plates and repeatedly warned that they were HOT.  Seriously, don't touch them. Let the staff move your plate around for you. I could feel the heat coming off the plate just sitting there!   My steak was cooked beautifully medium rare, just how I like it. And the lobster tails were plump and juicy -- Christian even showed me a way to remove the lobster meat from the tail to avoid losing any of it.  He said most people just hack away with a knife and fork and end up leaving some of the good stuff behind!    The creamed spinach was all that I hoped for -- this is one of my favorite sides and I order it whenever I can.  Lee seemed to enjoy his baked potato as well.  We finished off our dinner with an order of cheesecake.  I don't typically eat dessert but I do like cheesecake.  This might be one of my favorites that I've ever had. It wasn't overly creamy and it was served with a glaze as opposed to regular old whipped cream.     The next time I have a special occasion to celebrate, I know exactly where I'll head and what I'll order... and I'll be sure to ask to be seated with Christian again!"}
{"text":"Usually a Morton's guy but my son wanted this for his BDay & I hadn't tried them yet....very good food, from apps to dessert we were quite satisfied! A couple notes: the lobster bisque was a bit watery but still tasted great...my filet was more medium well than medium...other than these minor issues the food was great! Now I have to mention the reservation issue...I reserved a table online, received confirmation AND a phone call to confirm...OK, done...when we get to the greeter they didn't have our name?!!?! I was told they had us down for the next day...ok, your fault not mine...they sat us down & everything was fine...I even got a cancellation message for the reservation I didn't make??!! Again, minor stuff for what was a great night out!"}
{"text":"I'm really torn by this review. For years and years this was my favorite restarant in the downtown area. We went there last Saturday for dinner and had what I would deem an average meal at exorbitant prices. The salads, while tasty, were much smaller than I had remembered previously.  The side dishes, again, were seemingly smaller to not only me but our party as well. Unfortunately, the worst part of my meal were the steaks. For $45 I received a New York Strip that was WAY overpriced (my wife makes it all the time and much much better) and was, in a word, chewy. The service overall, was quite good, unless you like a car valet (they don't have it). Next time I'll try Morton's or Capital Grille."}
{"text":"Went to a Daou wine dinner. 5 course dinner and each course was really delicious. The wines were also good.  Would recommend the group dinners. Was out first."}
{"text":"Wait until dark! Always my favorite Resturant.  Still great food. \"The wait I until\" remark was because our reservations  was at 5:30 and it was still light outside.  This Pittsburgh location needed a little lower light.  The carpet was worn and faded and looked 100 years old.  In the evening light all the wood work looked dusty and in need of a do over. I also missed the placing of the napkin on your lap and the constant water filling attention you used to received. Price was the same but this Ruth's Chris experience was not up to expectations ! Oh, and my wife never received her dessert from the \"special\" Sad!"}
{"text":"When in town for a trade show,  do as the salesmen do;  go to a steak house.  This place was great for our team to sit around and have a relaxing dinner after a long day of trade show networking on our feet. The food and wine were absolutely delicious. I decided to go with the salmon,  which was done perfectly,  but those who got the steak could only say great things. The sides are family style to feed about 4 portions. I went with the bread pudding for dessert. Real good.   Our waitress was very kind and happy to work with our indecisive group,  supplying wonderful recommendations. Being a less mainstream steak house, the atmosphere was much more quaint and enjoyable.   Would easily recommend to anyone looking for a great steak house downtown."}
{"text":"Ruth's Chris is a 5* steakhouse. Everything is extremely well done, including the greeting, drinks, food, service, and atmosphere. Our dinner tonight was unplanned, although we were looking for a chance to see the remodeled restaurant. We had martinis, tomato mozzarella salad, au gratin potatoes, and small filets. Everything was great. We even overspent our calorie budget and had the bread pudding for desert. We'll return as soon as our checking account recovers."}
{"text":"Oscar Style is the way to go. Great service. Great atmosphere.  Gin and tonic is fantastic"}
{"text":"Always top notch service and food at Ruth's Chris Pittsburgh. They have some summery specials during these cold winter months to bring you out of the post-holiday funk, which is very refreshing to see. Stop in for lunch for great deals on amazing food. Their lunch cuts of beef, chicken and fish include 2 sides and a salad for an extremely reasonable price. I got the lunch petite filet, veggies, mashed potatoes and appetizer salad for 28 bucks! Not bad for a steakhouse. Our server was incredible, as usual, and was extremely attentive of my gluten-free needs. The servers are extremely knowledgeable of the menu and will accommodate you no matter what. The decor is a bit dated and is due for a remodeling, but perhaps that will be on the list of things to do for the chain since they are celebrating their 25th anniversary this year!"}
{"text":"Incredible service and beyond delicious. My service was A++. Food A+++. Ambience ++ I was greeted by just about everyone there as they all insured I had the best experience as I could have."}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience with a party of 6. The service was excellent, the wine list is extensive. We brought red wine with us and also purchased a bottle of Trefethen. Everyone in enjoyed their dinner selections. We had the pork chops, filet mignon, the Tomahawk steak with lobster. Love the consistency with this brand."}
{"text":"I have eaten at a lot of Ruth's Chris joints.  This was the only place where nothing tasted like any of them.  Apparently not part of the main chain and it shows.   Fail on all levels.  Had to send steak back twice before I just said to hell with it.  Horrible."}
{"text":"Alot of people wrote spot on positive reviews so i will some it up, they are probably the best steak house in Pittsburgh and that is saying something.  Pittsburgh has many good steakhouses.  Go earlier in the week, if your like me you hate waiting but Ruth's is probably the exception if you dont have a resavation.

{"text":"Fantastic food and wonderful staff, went for Anniversary dinner . 1st time trying but definitely not the last visit."}
{"text":"Dinned here last night for my birthday. Absolutely wonderful. Our waitress Erin was the best. Had the Porterhouse for two. Cooked to perfection. Drinks were great. This place lives up to all the hype. Best meal I have ever had. Had the strawberries and creme for desert, they were so sweet and delicious. The management were very nice and accomadating since we arrived about an hour early.  We are looking forward to coming back at New Years Eve."}
{"text":"Yes, it is a chain, but this location is still my favourite in Pittsburgh. Possibly it has to do with reminiscence. Here I had the first real steak of my life, and finally understood why anything above medium rare is considered butchery. Just watch out for the hot plates."}
{"text":"I visited Ruth's Chris for a second time. Upon entering the restaurant, I was greeted. My husband and I were seated at a table right near a wall, but I am slender enough to fit in the chair between the table and wall. The waitress and all of the other people who served us were courteous and brought out our food promptly. We enjoyed our appetizers of lobster bisque, which contained lobster meat and was one of the tastiest that I have had in my life, and a caesar salad. Our entrees of filet mignon and sea bass were cooked perfectly. Our sides of asparagus and french fries tasted good. Finally, we ate desserts of cherry cobbler, which seemed to have sparse and dry cherries, and creme brulee, which had a nice hard sugary topping and berries on the side."}
{"text":"So many people have raved about this place so I was so excited to bring my husband for his birthday. We were greeted by friendly staff and walked through the room that smelled of wonderful steak. We were seated and our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. Everything was fine until we got the food which was disappointing. I ordered off the special menu and had the corn chowder, a filet and lobster tail, a side of creamed spinach and dessert for about $55. My husband had the cowboy ribeye for $65, the scallops to start and a side of brussel sprouts.   The corn chowder was ok but not very hot. The scallops which came recommended were ok but they were on a pesto sauce which was simply too overpowering for the delicate scallop. We used the pesto to dip the bread in. The steaks came and were both overcooked. They were supposed to be medium rare but my filet was well done and his was more like medium. We should have complained but we decided to just eat bc we didn't want to wait and didn't think that they would be less well done since they come on a scorching hot plate. My husband liked the brussel sprouts but my creamed spinach was not hot and was stringy.   Again, the food was mediocre but the staff was extremely friendly. I booked on opentable and told them that it was his birthday and they did bring him a complimentary dessert. I prefer Morton's, Ditkas and Peter Luger's."}
{"text":"The best service & food! Can't go wrong here. Cannot wait to visit here again and other locations! HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"Best steak in Pittsburgh, if not among the best I've ever had. Service was excellent, food was superb, and downtown location is great for walking around after your meal. You can dress up or dress casual and both work just fine here.   The steak comes on a scalding hot plate, so beware not to touch it. The sides are served family-style, so one or two things will be good for 2-4 people. Of course it's expensive, so it's a special occasion type of place, but man will you not regret a penny of it."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that steakhouses like this participate in Restaurant Week, because I really couldn't be bothered to visit otherwise. They don't skimp on the food or service if you're here for that though. We were seated promptly after checking in for our reservation, and the waiters were professional throughout our meal, particularly in explaining the sizzling nature of the plate. The starting salad and bread were pretty standard. It didn't take long after finishing the salad for the star of the show to come out, and the plates were definitely sizzling. The piece of filet was quite large and very generous for the set price. It was full of flavor, despite (because of?) the minimal spices that they apply. The texture was also on point, although I probably would've preferred the meat a tad more tender. I ordered medium rare, and it did seem like it was slightly over that--maybe the idea that you should under order because the steak continues cooking on the plate is a valid one. Despite that though, it was still one of the best steaks I've had.  The sides are nice but very big. The mashed potatos were pretty standard, but definitely full of the starch that you probably don't need. The buttered spinach was tasty, but got a bit heavy toward the middle. The dessert pairings were pretty simple, though at that point we were too stuffed to really appreciate them anyway. Overall, the Restaurant Week offering was totally worth the entire meal."}
{"text":"You will be surprised. Really not that expensive.  Costs are very fair. Wine prices are unusually attractive, most under $40.00.  What makes Ruth's Chris costly is your ordering drinks, several appetizers, larger steaks than you need, wine, side dishes, dessert and coffee.  The 12 ounce fillet is a meal in itself. If you get a lot of side dishes, by the time you have a little of this, a little of that, your beef is cold.   Don't be cheap, but be realistic.   We were there for the beef. Excellent.   Try Ruth's Chris. You will remember the steak for a long time. That's why you went.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If \"treat yourself\" could be embodied by a restaurant, this place would be it. It's pricey for sure, but you can expect the quality of the food and service to reflect that. After having a nearly life-changing experience at a Ruth's Chris before, my boyfriend was determined to come test out another of their locations.   First of all, the service here is absolutely wonderful. Our server Christina was so personable and friendly, always smiling and happy to accommodate us. We came during Restaurant Week, and having been out a couple times before, we decided to split a restaurant week menu and tack on an appetizer + dessert.  - Barbecued shrimp: for an appetizer where each shrimp costed over $3, it was waaay overpriced for what we got. If I could do it again, I would rather have tripled my dessert order. But we'll get to that later. - Caesar salad: I'm not a salad person, but I quite enjoyed this. The flavors were good throughout. - Filet mignon: it was good! I divvied up more of my portion to my steak-loving boyfriend, as I was satisfied with just a few bites. He was very grateful. - Creamed spinach and mashed potatoes: surprisingly large portions. Both were very hearty and delicious.  - Creme brulee: UNFF. You HAVE to get this. I'd like to think I can identify a good dessert when I see one, and this one was HEAVENLY. The caramelized sugar crust was just the right thickness and evenly torched all over. The custard underneath was balanced and very smooth. I also quite like that you could see the black specks from the real vanilla beans they must have used in it. We had a restaurant week dessert as well, but it really couldn't hold a flame to this creme brulee. It's served with fresh berries too, which just made such a wonderful end to the meal.  I wonder if it's heresy to like the dessert at a steakhouse more than the steak.  Overall, I think it's important to order wisely here so you don't accidentally break your budget... but even if you do, the majority of what you get will be so worth it."}
{"text":"First time coming here. I took my husband here for his birthday dinner we loved it! We got appetizers (blackened scallops and stuffed mushrooms) and they both were very good. Our steaks were cooked to perfection and the brussel sprouts were to die for yum yum!!"}
{"text":"Incredible. My fiance and I had a reservation for Valentine's Day this year. We arrived and were immediately impressed. The staff was extremely friendly, the waiter greeted us by name, was knowledgeable about the menu and food options and was great at recommendations. Food arrived quickly and the drinks were fabulous. Over general discussion throughout the meal, he found out we were getting married this year.... so, at the end of dinner he brought us out a cheesecake with a very SPECIAL message. It was a wonderful experience all around. The restaurant is beautiful and clean, and the food was delicious. They also sent us home with chocolate covered strawberries as a parting gift. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in an upscale dinner experience."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch recently and all was excellent. I come here about 4 times a year. When I do go I prepare myself by not eating red meat several days prior to going. On the day of I make sure to eat a normal but smaller breakfast. No bagels as they occupy too much space. I arrive a bit later, I am a bit hungrier and the staff that remains are long time regulars who know me but are also there to earn a living and make my visit worthwhile. I always order a filet, medium with mushrooms. I don't drink when go, the beef is too good to have my senses misdirected. The plate and filet arrive in minutes, the plate is sizzling at 500 degrees, if by chance there is too much red in the meat I cut a piece and sizzle it right there on the plate. I recently tried the salmon on a recommendation from the owner and was wowed how good it was. Panko crumbs and lemon, great stuff.  I always feel they go the extra mile for me but the food and service are always top notch i can assume this is the standard."}
{"text":"Great service. The steaks are always classic and done well. The sides are great. Pricy but you get what you pay for. Downside? I hate the parking, location and navigating downtown. I would prefer to go to Hyde park in the north shore."}
{"text":"For being the best steakhouse in Pittsburgh---I don't think Ruth Chris's lives up to that name. But otherwise, it's a delightful restaurant with professional service, a large dining area, and of course, your favorite steaks served in the most indulgent way possible.  I started off my night with a calamari, and it was very nice. It wasn't too salty or dry, and the tangy sauce brought an exciting touch to every bite. The squid wasn't the best quality, but given we're in Pittsburgh, I'll give that a bye.  Next was the steaks, and wow, Ruth Chris's really brings a new definition to indulgence. Not only can you get your favorite cuts, but you get all the butter you want, cooked with whatever herbs you like, and finished however you please. It's just amazing, and you smell the buttery nuttiness all throughout the restaurant. I had the porterhouse for two, and of course it was great, and had the chew and temperature I wanted. If only I could get a dry aged steak, I'd be in love instantly.  With that aside, Ruth Chris's really executes steak the way it should be done. Not too much, but with all the extras you want. Speaking of which, I loved the truffle sauce with the steak. There's always a place for truffle, and I was pleasantly surprised with how well it fit with the steak. Another feature I really loved about Ruth Chris's was their wine selection. They had so many great choices, and at a reasonable price too, which I think brings a lot of merit to their sommelier.   I definitely enjoyed my time at Ruth Chris's, and although there was no dry aged, it still fulfilled most of my expectations and impressed me with all of their attention to the more auxiliary aspects of dining."}
{"text":"Wonderful service all around. Had a few drinks at the bar before dinner, bartender was great.  Food was your standard chops and fish. Very well prepared and tasty. Also a great wine list - I recommend the 2003 Lascombes if you like Bordeaux.  The location isnt the best (downtown) if you are looking for fun afterward."}
{"text":"oh. my. god.  the food was absolutely delicious.  service was divine.  ambience was impeccible.  This is seriously the best steak I have ever had in my life.  The sides were equally as delicious.  Plan on spending some serious bucks here."}
{"text":"This is by far the worse place ever!!!! I had reservations at 8:45 and waited 45 minuets and still didn't have a table!! Never again!!"}
{"text":"Did not disappoint. I've been to several other Ruth's Chris locations and this was on par if not better with the others. I had the cowboy ribeye cooked Pittsburgh rare, my wife and a friend had the surf and turf and his wife had the filet. All were cooked perfectly and were absolutely delicious. We also enjoyed the onion ring appetizer (totally recommend) as well as the potatoes au gratin and broccoli for sides. The potatoes were excellent however the broccoli could've stood some more seasoning as it was a little bland.   The wait staff was friendly, prompt, and efficient, I don't believe anyone saw the bottom of their glass without being asked for a refill.   All in all if you're looking for a meal worthy of the price, look no further, Ruth's Chris has you covered."}
{"text":"I am a premium steak fan and use Ruth's Chris to entertain my customers all over the US. I recently dined in Pittsburgh with my wide on Jan 4th and it did not go well. My wife's meal was wrong, my steak not done properly and the Mushrooms were cold. Luckily our waitress did a great job in getting it fixed. This should never happen at a restaurant of this caliber. My wife says it will be hard  to go back. They really blew this one."}
{"text":"Best stuffed chicken ever.. Well, not ever.. but you get the point. It was stuffed with cheese (creamed cheese if I could best describe it).  I also had thai flavored calamari, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes (i'm pretty sure these were store bought because they were very bland), salmon, stuffed mushrooms and a apple salad. The stuffed mushroom caps were pretty good, filled with crab and not too chewy.  The salmon was a little bland but the calamari was great! I would recommend for anyone going.  Ruth Chris has been known as the top teir steak restaurant, but other steakhouses and the slight increase in people's budgets make ruth Chris the last place to go on their steakhouse bucket list. Overall, it was ok, no complaints.  Setting : Ok.  Noise : Moderate  Food : Good, not great.  It's ruth Chris.  Price : $170 (two stuffed chicken, salmon, stuffed mushrooms, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, salad, calamari)  Come Back : Probably, not in a hurry though."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the food is not comparable to any other Ruth Chris I have been to and I've been to them in 10-15 different cities. My rib-eye was all fat and the waitress was so snotty we wanted to throw our drinks at her. Save your money, this place doesn't deserve to be named Ruth Chris. I've had better steaks at the Outback Steakhouse!!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. The steaks are good but not good enough for the prices. They don't have that much flavor and if you get anything else besides steak, it will be dry and tasteless. But overall the customer service is excellent and the drinks are incredible. Expensive and slightly overpriced. But it is a nice establishment and worth it if you're looking to impress a date."}
{"text":"Good overall experience, but for the price I'd really like my steak to be perfect. The whole table ordered medium rare but ate a medium steak because the hot plate that the steaks were served on continued cooking the steak"}
{"text":"This place is number one in the holy beef book of my parents and extended family.  Ruth's Chris is nice, but still a steakhouse chain.  It's \"Pittsburgh fancy\".  As a non-eater of cow, everyone is slightly confused on why this place is one of my favorites, but between the service, the bar, and the dessert, it's difficult to find something you don't like.  I usually opt for a bottle of moscato, but last opportunity, I ordered the peach pear martini.  It was light, but had a real pear flavor--not that perfume one that happens way too often.  You receive the entire shaker which is exciting (or sad that it excites me), almost always there is little bonus drink left.  The +1 had an \"In Fashion\":  pretty much an old fashioned with an orange liquor.  For a glass of mostly spirits, it was made well.  Again, I cannot vouch for the steak. 95% of those in my party cleared their steak plates (with only one slight complaint from Mr. N who had a little tiff that his butter did not sizzle for long enough, but that's a whole different issue).  They apparently do it well, with LOTS of butter.  Speaking of butter, they also cook their chicken (my main go to) in these heaps of fat, and it is the best thing that has ever happened to that bird.  I've never had chicken elsewhere as tender as this.  A bird with the consistency of a beef filet (at least what I remember) is only found at Ruth's Chris.  Don't forget you order the sides separately, and that is where they get you.  Do not order a side for every person.  You will have multiple boxes of mashed potatoes and an extra forty bucks on your bill.  Most importantly, you gotta order dessert here.  It may look lame  with basic berries and cream, crème brulée, ice cream, etc. \"Where is the bourbon salted caramel and hibiscus pate de fruits?\" In Lawrenceville, probably.  But that doesn't mean the staples here aren't just as rich and delicious.  To be totally honest, I come here for the crème brulée. Vanilla bean custard under that torched sugar top and a side of berries is all I need.  To prove the real reason this place is great, a tidbit of the N family being a total mess.  Last visit we managed to break two wine glasses and spill a water (it was my sister, I swear), causing a commotion which required two servers, a busboy, tablecloths, and a new cocktail to help us get our lives together.  And the service remained great for the rest of the meal. I know most places of this old man meat club genre would not have appreciated this to the point of scorn for our table.  But no, this isn't stuffy enough for that somehow.  Good drinks, incredible desserts, and not nearly as much frou frou as other similar spots. I hear the steak is all right too."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with 50 dollar prime beef every so often. This place is a treat... a very very expensive treat. No complaints at all about the food or the service. If your considering this restaurant then you know what to expect and that is top quality all around.  Side note... I think the steaks are just a little bit better than Texas Roadhouse and you could buy three of their steaks for the price of one at RC. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"Last night was my third visit to Ruth Chris in Pittsburgh. The food was as usual superb. I was with a group of friends and had a filet and lobster tail. We shared three bottles of wine with our meal, several appetizers and four or five side dishes. In short, we spent a lot of money.  Things started to go wrong when we arrived. We had made a reservation several weeks prior to arriving. We like to arrive very early and have drinks at the bar prior to being seated. When we got there we were told the bar was closed due to renovations. Why weren't we told this two weeks ago?  We walked across PPG plaza and had a drink at Poros. This would not have been a big deal except one of our party has great difficulty walking. This distance taxed his walking ability.   Anyhow we had a drink and walked back again taxing our friends limit. We were seated and had another drink. We ordered and ate. When asked if we wanted more bread we said yes, but it never came. When asked again if we wanted more bread bread we again said yes. It never came. Okay, that's no big deal. But, the bread is very good.  We finally finish and get our check. Our banker calculates the tip, divides but our number and we all toss in a credit card. The banker tells the waitress put $100+ on each card plus $20 on each tip line. The waitress informs us the system is down and the manual backup won't be able to do this. So we had her put the $100+ on each card and we each threw in $20 cash for the tip.   The manual system took a long time. About 20 minutes finally she returned with hand written old style carbon receipts with our full card information on each one. A woman in our party works for the foreign service and she was horrified that this information was all there for the world to see.  The bottom line is we do a steak dinner evening about six times a year. We rotate different high end restaurants. Ruth Chris is out of the rotation. They should think about Square as a backup system."}
{"text":"No matter which location I go to, I am never disappointed with Ruth's Chris.  I would live here if I could...  Feeling hungry?  Try the Porterhouse...AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Excellent in all respects, except for help figuring out the parking.  One one gets that down, the experience would be so much better.  Absolutely the best service we've had in Pittsburgh, and this includes lots of the fu-fu places.  Attention to detail.  Ample staff.  No rush.  Clean and tidy.  A true positive pittsburgh experience but ... figure out the parking issue before you get on the road."}
{"text":"Filets always perfection. Tried the risotto and it was really good. Wine is always top notch! Love coming here!!"}
{"text":"What can you say about a chain like this? Well, the steaks are quality, and my filet was done Pittsburgh rare just as I asked. All the sides are pretty pedestrian steak-house fare. I will say the veg wasn't overcooked.  The decor needs a makeover big-time. Heavy cafe curtains and shutters cover the windows - closed in to the point that you don't realize half the restaurant is glass! It could just as easily be in a basement. The finishes - oak, printed carpet, banquette upholstery - is just a bit above what was standard in Eat-n-Park just over a decade ago.  These places will always be popular for a certain demographic of diner - but I can't help to think a light re-invention and a little imagination would lift them above Morton's and the like. With all the creative cooking going on in America these days, Ruth's Chris is coasting a bit.  Lunch is better than dinner - the portions are more realistic, and you don't have to have 6 people dining to make use of their family-size side dish portions."}
{"text":"I came here for a Valentine's Day dinner with a group of people.  The wait staff was great. Very professional and attentive. I ordered scallops for an appetizer and they were tasty. For my main course I had steak and lobster with a side salad. I added an extra side of Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts are delicious. I would come back here definitely"}
{"text":"When it comes to the high-end chain steakhouses, Morton's and Capital Grille are great.  They consistently deliver great steaks and dependable apps, sides, and desserts.  However, my first and forever true love for steaks will always be Ruth's Chris.  I can still remember my first trip there in high school after my buddy's dad took us there to celebrate graduation.  As the 500 degree plate came out with the glorious aroma of perfectly cooked meat sizzling in butter, I knew I was not only in for something special, but a livelong love.  Ruth's Chris is a franchise and the setting in different cities can be quite variable.  The Philadelphia Ruth's Chris is right next to the Academy of Music with gas lamps lighting Broad St.  The Boston's Ruth's Chris is in old city hall with a beautiful ceiling 2 stories up in the bar area.  Pittsburgh's Ruth's Chris cannot boast such extravagance in their setting, but the food is equally outstanding in all their restaurants.  My recent venture to Ruth's Chris was with 4 other young men in a \"guys night out.\"  I brought several bottles of wine (you have to love the PA Chairman's selection) because Ruth's Chris amazingly allows you to do this.  We started with the seared Ahi tuna.  It was raw, thick, and delicious.  Actually, it kind of tasted like steak.  We each went on to get various cuts of meat.  I personally rolled with my favorite:  NY Strip, medium rare (correctly done with a blood red center), extra butter.  The extra butter is key.  If you're going to roll with a decadent feast of steak, might as well pull out all the stops.  It was brought out absolutely perfect and delicious.  The table also shared the excellent huge family-style sides of asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes.  Our server was extremely gracious.  She opened and decanted a couple of our bigger bottles as soon as we sat down to give them time to breathe.  They arranged for us to have a cab-van at the end of our meal to take us to our next location.    If I was really searching for something negative to say, it's that I wish that the Pittsburgh Ruth's Chris was in a more extravagant setting like some bigger cities.  However, since the main menu is exactly the same, Ruth's Chris is forever my go-to location for a perfect steak dinner."}
{"text":"Everything starts with the service. Our waitress was phenomenal.  We had a party of 9 and she tended to our very needs. She explained the menu throughly and made our time there worth the while. The food was amazing. Everything was freshly made and seasoned.  Yes, the prices are extreme, but you definitely get what you pay for. I highly recommend this place for a fancy evening for your loved one."}
{"text":"We dined here on Father's Day. Surprisingly, a lot of others were also treating the \"Dad\" in their life to a legendary steak. I had requested a romantic booth not knowing that they didn't have such a thing. But we did get a small table stuck in the corner. While you don't seem to get a lot of privacy, you do get good service and a pretty decent meal.   We started with a with a Crabtini to share. It's lump crab meat tossed in vinaigrette and served with Creole remoulade sauce in a chilled martini glass. Very yummy!   As for our steaks, they were amazing. I had a filet mignon. It was very flavorable and cooked to perfection. This is one of the best steaks that I have ever had. For our sides, we shared a one pound baked potato and asparagus with hollandise. For dessert, we shared a crème brûlée with fresh berries. Very delicious. Definitely a very nice special occasion restaurant."}
{"text":"Hostess: 1.0 Bartender/ waiter: 2 Food: 3 Property: style decor ambiance: 2  When did they start storing their stuffed olives in Styrofoam cups?"}
{"text":"I\"m a big fan of the Ruth's Chris brand.  It's consistently good no matter where you are, and you can count on the big, fat delish steak and some humungo sides!  We popped in here w/out a ressie just after Christmas to visit w/some family we hadn't seen in awhile.  They were able to seat us at a table in the bar, which was great since we were drinking some nice wine and getting a little boistrous...:)  All the food was great - everyone had steaks and we shared some sides.    Except my poor dairy-free partner.  I\"m sorry to say it, but do not come here if you have a food allergy.  There's just nothing they can do to accomodate.  He had the fish, which came out dry and tasteless (apparently they don't have olive oil - only butter??!!) and was quite frankly the price of a steak, and none of the sides were really exciting for him - I think we had the steamed broccoli.  bla.    Look, I'm a fan.  But only go and spend this sort of money if you can really get the true steak-cooked-in-butter and everything-has-butter-and-cheese experience."}
{"text":"I took my parents here because it's one of their favorite places, but I wasn't that impressed.  The service was impeccable, but the food - not much different than Outback or Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here. The service was wonderful, and the food was pretty good. We started off with the crab cakes, which I wasn't super impressed by, but I ordered the Cobb salad for my entree, which was wonderful. I would definitely recommend Ruth's but definitely start off with a different appetizer."}
{"text":"Does not even compare to our hometown Ruth's Chris in Fairfax, Va. Normally this is where we'd get the best steak we ever tasted. My husband's filet was just ok and almost over cooked. My scallops were boarder line undercooked and were just ok. Probably one of the worst meals we've had at a Ruth's Chris. However hats off to our server, Kathy who was excellent and very on top of things. As well as the hostess and other support staff, bussers, etc."}
{"text":"This a top shelf Ruths Chris!!! Its a franchise vs. the garden variety corporate ones down in Florida which are inferior in every way... For starters our steaks weren't seared to a crisp! The temperatures were PERFECT which was refreshing after our disaster at the one in Boca. But the fries... OH THE FRIES!!! I heard trumpets playing Beethovens Ninth as they were delivered to our table! I choked back tears of joy as I munched on them.... Absent were the deceptive \"fry horns\" that corporate Ruth Chris' use to deceive their diners about the actual number of fries they are really being served! We were treated to a massive pile of the most delicious fries ever conceived by humankind!!! The table got dark as they blocked out the light from our candle... This fry eclipse lasted until I devoured the top layer and fell into a deep food coma. My buttery ribeye and these magnificent fries made me forget that I was a Hurricane Irma refugee! But our server didn't as she treated us to a complimentary desert with heartfelt well wishes... I will always fondly remember this city and Ruths Chris in particular! What a special place..."}
{"text":"A sizzling steak is their signature. But, when I think of this place, I think old man's club. Sorry, I just do. Steak, the MAN's meat. But was that sizzling petite filet good? It was delicious! And \"petite\" meaning 8oz, which isn't even petite in my book!  We came here for the Hubs birthday pick. It had been a really long time since I'd been here, so I was foggy on the details of what to expect, other than steak. We were happy to hear they just started carrying oysters, so we ordered up some Blue Points. I loved whatever lemon/vinegar concoction came with it!  The sides were just okay. We ordered the brussells with bacon and cheesy potatoes. Nothing fabulous, but not bad by any means. Plus, you get complimentary bread. Which you need once you receive the bill. Daaaaaaaaang is it expensive. That's one thing I will always remember!   One thing I will say is that the service is exceptional. I would expect nothing less. Especially because you gotstabe ballin' if you come here. You will not be ballin' when you leave... because you'll be broke. But you'll be full!"}
{"text":"I took my parents out to celebrate the Christmas season.  My mother ordered the petite filet mignon, which she thought was very good.  The sides we ordered - mashed potatoes and creamed spinach, were also good.  However, my father and I shared the porterhouse for two.  For $90, I would have expected a much better piece of meat.  Flavor was good, but It was tough.  There were some pieces which could not be cut by my knife.  In addition, the presentation was poor.  They put a big plate in the center of the table, then cut up the steak into 10 or 12 cubes.  These cubes were then cooked.  I could have done better at home."}
{"text":"Ordered the filet here with a group of friends recently and asked it to be medium rare, came out well done and I mean rubber well done. I didn't want to be the guy out of the group to send it back so I just threw some garlic mashed potatoes (very good but hard to screw up mashed potatoes) to help me get the steak down.  Being downtown, I would easily go to Capital Grille or Morton's a few blocks away if I wanted a steak that was cooked correctly. I have been to both of those establishments multiple times and have never gotten a bad mean, I figured I would switch it up at Ruth Chris' and was very disappointed. Looks like I will be sticking to Capital Grille or Morton's"}
{"text":"The best restaurant in the burgh..I travel from California and this is my go to place to eat..sweet potato with vanilla ice cream so good"}
{"text":"The steaks here are very good.  It's the same quality as the other high end places (prime cuts, aged, etc.).  However, I love the fact that they serve them on  platters sizzling with butter.  That's something somewhat unique compared to some of the other shops.  I love the sound of the sizzle as the plates approach the table.  I had dinner a couple of nights ago and while the steaks are top notch the bar isn't that good.  The  bartenders are competent, but the atmosphere is pretty lame.  It's kind of an afterthought it seems.  Oh yeah, and they don't have Guiness on tap.  I'm going to start a petition that  no liquor licenses should be issued without a guarantee that the proprietor have guiness on tap.  I mean, how do you not at a steakhouse?  If you  go here for dinner do your  happy hour elsewhere.  The service is very good.  The crab stuffed mushrooms are okay, but they certainly aren't noteworthy.  The mashed potatoes are great and the asparagus is okay, but I think  at high end steakhouses they should have asparagus that is as big as a baseball bat, something you can't get at the local grocery.  Overall a very fine experience.  I'd rate the chain steakhouses  in this city in this order for sit down dinners Mortons, Capital Grille,  Ruth Chris, Hyde Park.  And, for bar area and bar dining Capital Grille, Hyde Park, Mortons, Ruth Chris."}
{"text":"1st time visitor for a celebratory meal. Staff was truly awesome and helpful in every aspect. Ordered surf and turf which tasted very well made, cooked perfectly. Also had a ribeye which was cooked perfectly also had a bit of extra fat on it. The sides were the disappointment compared to the entrees. Brussel sprouts were overdone and quite greasy. Loaded baked potato was big but nothing to write home about. The atmosphere was very nice . Creme Brulee desert was average for the level of place they are trying to portray. Cocktail was well made. Pricey of course but you already know that is what you are going to deal with."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try out Ruth's Chris for my birthday. One year away from 30, might as well go all out!  We had a reservation for 9pm, but since we had a babysitter for the night, a rarity for us, we decided to go early and sit at the bar. We arrived around 7:30 and were shown to the bar. All three bartenders introduced themselves and were very friendly and attentive. My husband ordered a glass of wine, and I had a peachy pear tini. They are not shy with the liquor. This was the most stout martini, especially flavored martini, that I've ever tasted. But although it was heavy on the liquor, it still tasted great, and was a good pre-meal start. We were so hungry and impatient that we decided to order our appetizer at the bar instead of waiting. We split an order of the stuffed mushrooms. They were cooked perfectly, amazing texture, and the stuffing was amazing. Shortly after we finished up our appetizer my husband informed the bartender that we were ready for the check for this portion of our meal, and they sat us at our table a half hour earlier than our reservation was set, which was great.  Our server was very friendly, very attentive, and very pleasant. The restaurant itself is lovely and feels fancy, especially for folks like us to whom \"eating a good steak\" generally means a trip to Outback. The wine menu was pretty extensive, and my husband had two more glasses of a red wine, while I decided on a Patrón margarita. Once again, the most stout margarita I've ever been served at a restaurant. It was delicious.  We started with salads; my husband had the Caesar, and I had the strawberry almond salad. The portions were large and both salads were delicious. My salad had just enough dressing to taste it lightly but none was visible on the plate.   For our main meal, my husband had the 22oz Cowboy ribeye rare, while I ordered the filet medium. Both of our steaks were cooked exactly to our preference. We both agreed to being served our steaks on the 500 degree hot plates, which was an excellent decision as they kept the steaks at a consistently good temperature for the duration of our meal, including for me, and I'm a fairly slow eater. We ordered steamed broccoli and potatoes au gratin as our sides. The potatoes were delicious. The broccoli was undercooked, but honestly were an afterthought and neither of us cared about it with all of the other delicious things we had at our fingers.  For dessert, we decided to treat ourselves and split two desserts. We ordered the chocolate sin cake, and at the suggestion of many other Yelp reviewers, I had to try the créme brûlée. The chocolate sin cake was very rich and delightfully textured. A few small bites was enough to sate my desire for anymore; it tasted delicious but was so very heavy and rich I couldn't eat much. The créme brûlée however, was easily one of the most delicious desserts I've ever had placed in front of me, and my husband agreed. The sugar was perfectly caramelized on top, which made a thin crispy layer on top of the decadently textured créme. It was like eating cream cheese air. My husband and I have already talked about taking a night to go sit at the bar and specifically order nothing but the créme brûlée.   Overall we had an excellent experience here. The service was fantastic and all of the food, minus the broccoli (but really who cares about that) was truly fantastic. With the steep prices it's not something we will be doing often, but it was a great night of splurging and very much worth a night of spoiling ourselves."}
{"text":"Went to Ruth's for New Year's Eve dinner with a couple friends.  I had been there about a year ago for my birthday, and there are definitely things to compare.  First of all, the food was good, but not as spectacular as I remember.  That might be just because our overall experience was not as lustrous as last time, or maybe it just wasn't as perfect.  We had the calamari for an appetizer.  It was good, but a little overdone.  It had gone into the rubbery texture everyone wants to avoid.  I had a petit filet, cooked at medium rare.  Could have used a little more seasoning.  Also, I asked if I had to order the full dipping trio to get the truffle butter -- I only wanted the truffle butter -- and she said unfortunately yes.  That was fine, but the other two sauces were then wasted.  In a high end steakhouse, you should be able to order exactly what you want.  My boyfriend had a ribeye cooked to medium, and he has no complaints that I know of.  We shared the lobster mac & cheese, which was really good.  People don't rave about it on other reviews, but we both really enjoyed it.  I also had a coconut ginger lemon drop -- awesome!  Tasted like vacation!  But didn't hold up well flavor wise as it got warm.  No dessert for us, just coffee for me.  My main complaint for the evening, and why I only gave 4/5 stars was the service.  It started out really, really well, but once it was time to actually have food come out, it was like we never saw our server ever again.  Took forever to get the check at the end, and then forever to get the credit card back.  The last time we were there, the service was impeccable.    I do want to say, though, that their renovation is beautiful.  It looked like a completely different place, and we almost walked right by it.  Much more modern and open than before."}
{"text":"I've been to this Ruth's Chris several times. Often in the winter, we will head in for an early dinner and then skate off the calories at the PPG ice rink across the street.  As long as you make a reservation, seating shouldn't be a problem. I have never had to wait more than five minutes unless I was waiting for someone. If you do have to wait, sit at the bar and order one of their cocktails (Pear Martini and the mojito are excellent.) Extensive wine list.  All of the appetizers are delicious. Favorites include the Ahi Tuna, crabcake, and stuffed mushrooms. But you're going there for the steak, right? Right.   The last time I went, they had a special where two people could have filets and split a lobster. We elected for this option. I ordered my steak medium. It came out sizzling in butter. After overcoming my caveman urges to tuck in to the obviously too-hot-to-eat-yet steak, I instead ate some of the asparagus we ordered as an appetizer.   Important note. At Ruth's Chris, almost all sides are family sized so you can share. Our asparagus was perfectly cooked and was accompanied by a delicious hollandaise.   Finally, we made our way to the steaks. Cooked exactly to order and seared in butter, it was delicious and tender. The lobster was slightly overcooked, but still tasty.   Service is always excellent. Tip well.   Cons. The restaurant is very expensive. I like to go for special occasions or for when they have specials."}
{"text":"I realize I may not have the common opinion on this restaurant, but after going there a couple times I am just not pleased.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good. I can't complain, however given the price I don't think it is worth it. I have had just as good of a steak for much less cost, and quite honestly if you are looking for a high end steak place I recommend Eddie Merlot's over Ruth's Chris. I think the food is much better for about the same price.   This past time I went to ruth's chris I got the ribeye, creamed spinach, sweet potatoes, and brussel sprouts. Again, the food was all good it just wasn't stellar."}
