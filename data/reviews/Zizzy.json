{"text":"It's been a couple years since the last time I was at Zizzy, but as I recall I had a great experience.  Drinks are fantastic, service is fast and the private karaoke room was pretty cool.  I'll be here again for my friend's birthday this Saturday ~ we'll see if things got better!"}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees and beyond the cats pajamas! Marlon the bartender is amazing and needs a raise ASAP! And Angela?! Hubba hubba ;)))

Happy Hour specials is hard to beat here and the yogurts soju Is super yummy with good portions!"}
{"text":"One of my favs spot to chill whenever I'm in Vegas. It's away from the main but yet close enough.  The price is fair on the cheap side with decent services."}
{"text":"HH here is awesome! if its not already playing, ask and they'll play K-pop. 

I'm korean, the sushi is blah. the ddukbokki is good, decent - expensive tho! $13 for what should cost no more than $8/9. love the skewers.

there are rice bowls with meat - the portions are not super-sized, so if you're looking for quantity, this isn't the place.

nice chill (not crowded) place to come relax after rough day at work.
it's a bar though, so if someone comes in & wants to smoke, they can :(
HH prices really can't be beat & their soju is very tasty!"}
{"text":"Great staff friendly, easy to get too A little difficult to find parking but well worth fighting for a spot. karaoke plus food plus some good drinks really great prices."}
{"text":"Best bar I go just to chill and drink, bartenders are the best to fill up your glass with any of your choices, recommended to everyone to come by and drink!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a long time! Great spot to relax and have a few Korean brew and soju! Yes it is a small spot and the bar is small but that's what gives this place character."}
{"text":"This rating is only for the Karaoke room.  Karaoke system is soo outdated, I don't know where to begin. Also, very limited of options to adjust the system."}
{"text":"The worst place!!!!!

My family and I were in Vegas in june of 2012 for the weekend, came here after a night out - thought it'd be a nice fix for sushi. Really couldn't have been more wrong...

Service was horrible, the guys leading this place pay more attention to their friends than paying customers. Also, horrible at taking orders - missed about 3+ orders out of our group of 10. One of us didn't even get out order at all! And one thing, I myself ordered the Avocado lover roll; it's not even a roll! It's basically a big chunk of avocado! $13 for that was definitely NOT worth it. That order didn't even come until much later, the guy taking the orders said he \"didn't get that one\" when that was the first freaking thing I wanted in the first place! Shouldn't have even ordered it at all...

This place is overpriced and so unprofessional. We all hated it."}
{"text":"Love this place New owner and great employees. They are all very nice and attentive. They have amazing food and drinks. The new owner has definitely turned this place around!"}
{"text":"What is more exciting than your first Korean karaoke bar experience?  NOTHING!

Last night, a MASSIVE (12+) group of my friends and I headed to Zizzy's (also called Z2) after a few hours of pool and drinks at a PT's.  It's located right beside the Chinatown Mall, but is hard to spot because it's set back from the road in a strip mall, so look out for it!  We had to U turn to get in...  Parking was alright at 9pmish on a Friday night, but it's surrounded by several Korean and Chinese bbq joints so it may be more of an issue during dinner hours.  

When we first walked in, I was very impressed by the decor and feel of the place.  The windows and doors are all tinted very dark, so even with all the lights around it it was nice and dim.  They have a few tables and a bar in the front for those who just come to dine.  Overall it was very posh and tasteful.  

Our sever led us back to their largest room (room 2 is great for huge crowds!)  It was very dark in the room with a large bench sofa than ran three walls of the room and two large tables.  On the fourth wall was a huge entertainment center with a large flat screen in the middle, the song number puncher (if you can't find the remote...it really is dark!) and smaller screens.  After we all snuggled in, the soju and warm sake started flowing and the server kept it coming!  You can also order food and have it brought to your room.  We got an order of shrimp tempura, and they give a heaping pile of six or seven large shrimp instead of the three I usually see on a tempura appetizer.  I had a bite of one and it wasn't bland or dry like some places.  Veerry tasty if you are a shrimp tempura fan.

The majority of their karaoke selection is Vietnamese and Korean, but they did have a good collection of standard karaoke songs for Westerners like me.  Hit Me Baby, Dirrty, P.I.M.P, As You Are, Eternal Flame, and of course I Will Survive were just a few in our repertoire that night!  They provide you with two microphones but everyone was yelling so loud, thanks to Mr. Soju, that we didn't need more anyway.

The room runs around 25-30 bucks an hour.  The soju comes in around 13 bucks a bottle.  Dunno how much the sake or tempura was, but it totaled out around 25 or 30 bucks a person, and worth every penny.  I made new friends, tried new things, got GREAT pictures, and I will definitely be tagging along for the next outing at Zizzy's!"}
{"text":"This place is great but it's also not the best.

It's nice they serve food to you but It's very pricey.  Nothing on their menu is too Wow...and the selection of music is okay.  They have different folders of music, and have separate singing rooms.  It's like a typical asian karoke place. 

I like their soju though.  Other than that eh.  It was okay."}
{"text":"I love this place. Cheap and happy hour goes til 9. Rebecca is so sweet i want to put her in my pocket!!! Definitely be back. Beware it's a bit on the warm side, make sure you arent wearing long sleeves because it gets hot in there."}
{"text":"With Lindsey H. @ Zizzy's. Great evening, drinks, food and then the damn bill. Uhh, why the hell is my $40.02 bill not crossed out and written to the tune of $20.01!!! WTH? what do you mean you don't have Happy Hour from 6pm to 9pm anymore?? Uhh this is why we come here! So yes, this is or I should say WAS one of our spots that we frequent until we received our bills this evening. This was a great place to go for Happy Hour. I mean 6pm to 9pm? Where else can you find that in Vegas? I had to say something because we were clearly pissed. The gents were very nice about it yes, but damn give me a heads up. We ordered OVER $200  in food and drinks! So the bartenders/servers (great service by the way) said they are revamping the place and they are going to bring happy hour back at it's regular time and then a late nite happy hour. Ok, cool but we sure as hell will not be back until then."}
{"text":"I cant begin to comprehend how such a small  establishment with only a few empty  tables and with two to three occupied tables on a slow friday night can two employees still give such poor customer service. my party had made numerous  attempts to get our server's attention to a point where all of us had to call and wave our hands only to be ignored. Then have the odacity to drink with their friends and be on their phones. This experience only justifies why this place was a second choice."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  Found this place on Yelp coz I was craving for Asian food and my white business partner was craving for hard alcohol.  Great happy hour specials, food is great and the drinks are legit.  Atmosphere is the bomb and the music really is upbeat.  Staff is really friendly.  This is a new go-to place for me."}
{"text":"Just stumbled upon this hidden gem. Insane happy hours and great staff! Good chance I'll be visiting here weekly if not daily."}
{"text":"Place was great buckets of beer for 16 great music selection and not to big so service was great would definitely come again. Karaoke was up to date with an easy way to search for artist and songs instead of searching through the book!!"}
{"text":"Justin is awesome! Very attentive and professional. He has the right staff and his happy hour is phenomenal. This is my first time here and I will definitely come back. Try the soju cocktails, they are to die for."}
{"text":"Whenever I come to Vegas, (4 or 5 times a year), I still need my karaoke fix.  I don't like paying ten bucks a song at those karaoke clubs on the strip.  So I drive out to chinatown and spend three hours at Zizzy.  The price is decent, fifteen dollars an hour for my friend and I, and it's clean and laid back.  When you walk in it looks like it's only a bar but the karaoke rooms are down the hallway.  I ordered soju from the bar, but  out of habit I brought in my large cup of soda pop laced with vodka.  I usually end up throwing it on my friend because his singing sucks.  ( I know what you are thinking, how rude I am for throwing vodka on my friend.  But like I tell him, it could be worse, vodka has no smell.  What if I threw cheap wine on him?  Then he would walk around the rest of the night smelling like a homeless wino who can't sing! )  If you like to karaoke and you need to get away from the strip for awhile, then check this place out.   ( They don't take Discover card. )"}
{"text":"So I haven't been here in over 3 year and went here with a group of friends. Called Saturday and they got my group of 7 in a small both. Was expecting it to be too small but definitely had enough room! 

Soju was great and they had a buy 2 get 1 deal. We also had kamikaze drinks and they definitely got the night going.

So I was really happy with the service, from the host that setup our over the phone reservation, to the attentiveness of the staff. Justin was fantastic, very fast in getting us our drinks and helpful working the karaoke machine.

Overall was a great time with local friends. I highly recommend ZiZZYS because of the service. I work in the service industry and I can say that the staff tonight were great!! 

Perry"}
{"text":"I think I found my spot  friendly bar, karaoke private rooms, reasonable drink prices, karaoke room rates are hella cheap compared to karaoke room rates in Hawaii, food is great not to mentioned that the shrimp tempura here is bomb, and most importantly it is a CLEAN joint! 
I've never tried flavored Soju until here, a must try! The lovely bartender Jen is great company, great service! Will definitely be back with my entire entourage!!!"}
{"text":"I like this little bar. It is modern and cozy at the same time. They have several rooms for karaoke depending on the size of your group. This is a great place to hang out if you want it to be a little low key. I like drinking Hite beer! :)"}
{"text":"Well thank you other reviewers for some hearty laughs! Yes this place has its quirks but overall my friends and I had an awesome time full of laughter and sick cat-type singing. 

The place is pretty cut and dry. There are karaoke rooms, there is a bar, there are restrooms. The rest is up to you! Their song choices are overall pretty decent, there were a few here and there that we couldn't believe they didn't offer. The videos, though as lots of people mention have absolutely no bearing on what song you're singing, were incredibly entertaining! I mean one of the stars in numerous videos was named Banana Girl...how can you not love that??!! Who needs American videos?

My only semi-complaint was that we weren't made aware of a button to get the waiter so we went out and got our drinks every time. Not the end of the world cause you get some fresh air but minus a star on customer service. The drinks aren't bargain basement but they're strong so who cares. A few margaritas, some Sapporo and you're all set! 

Overall this place is a good time. Even if your friends insist they don't sing karaoke, they will. It's contagious!!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years. If you are a fan of Karaoke, then you'll love this place! Get drunk and sing to cheap-ass sounding versions of songs you know while watching the Korean videos in the background under the lyrics.

Limited song library and like I said not the highest quality music,but, that's part of the charm.

You rent your own private karaoke room (noribong) and the staff brings you your food and drink orders. Make sure to try Soju if you haven't before."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, the rooms aren't overly priced and the food and drinks are good! Not shy about the liquor on the mixed drinks at all. I love going out and doing karaoke but I don't always enjoy the other people singing. The rooms are life savers on that.. AND it's perfect for a private party."}
{"text":"Lemme just preface by saying that ME and KARAOKE = LOVE!!

Came here on a Wednesday night and it was $15 hour. SCORE!!! They didn't ask for a drink minimum, which is great! Though I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't a broader non-alcoholic drink menu. I know, I know...how does one sing karaoke without singing? Trust me, it can be done!!

The song selections, while fairly up-to-date, don't have the original music videos, but rather, Korean actors/actresses trying to dance/walk/sing/(insert verb choice) to the song. Still, a fabulous time was had by all and I would go back in a heartbeat if ever in town!!

It is located next to the Tea Station in Chinatown on a busy street so it was easy to locate and only a $8 (incl. tip) cab ride from the Palazzo. Oh, and the employees were kind and attentive! That never hurts!!"}
{"text":"Zizzy is quietly becoming one of my favorite spots in town to grab a drink or a quick bite of bar food here in Vegas. What I like most about this place is their happy hour, which lasts from 6pm to 9pm. 

This little bar is located in the popular strip mall that houses Ichiza, Tea Station, and a bunch of other crowd pleasing eateries. Parking here can get kinda crazy, especially during peak hours, so sometimes it's better to park in the Chinatown Mall, right next door, and walk over.

I like the dark, intimate setup when you walk through the door. There are a few small tables where groups can hang out. This place is also a Korean karaoke bar, with rooms in the back where you can unleash your inner Ariana Grande. There is a full kitchen in here, so you can order a wide variety of food options.

But, let's face it. You know I'm all about that HH. Zizzy has the best happy hour times of 6pm to 9pm. I mean, come on! That is ridonkulous!! On the board it says that the HH changes regularly, but the current promotion is half off drinks and $2 off apps. I got a bottle of yogurt soju for like 6 bucks. And Zizzy pours their YS stronger than Bazic or any other K-bar in town. Great deal. Also, got a huge mound of crispy, well seasoned fries for 3 bucks. Can't beat it. 

One of my favorite hang out spots with buds, bartenders are cool as hell, and will probably partake in some karaoke festivities in the very near future."}
{"text":"Great specials and service. I work in the nightclub industry and am always looking for great spots OFF the Strip to hang out and this place is great. Karaoke bar that's open late night. Perfect spot to hang out after a late night."}
{"text":"This place is totally awesome.. cheap drinks super fun ! Great service!! A++++ people"}
{"text":"Best bar in chinatown by far! Angela knows how to make them drinks. The owner is very courteous and knows how the customers need to be treated!"}
{"text":"Super cute, intimate. Sweet bartender. Good music in front and a party in every room! Great happy hour specials, and great sound proofing of the karaoke rooms."}
{"text":"It was a fun place with friends. Though the karaoke was beautiful with it's level of powrmetal available. But yeah, that's really all I have to say."}
{"text":"I didn't end up eating bc we went to Sushi Kaya, but the drinks were GREAT!  Plus $2.00 off for happy hour and free shot with a review"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years!!! Love the place, staff,... Nothing can go wrong when you and your friends have privacy in singing all your heart out. Will always come back. ;)"}
{"text":"Chinatown's best kept secret! Karaoke bar + open late + food = what more can you ask for?! Great spot to check out after a long night clubbing or for post-work cocktails off the Strip."}
{"text":"Private parking lot, does get extremely crowded since its shared with other restaurants and businesses.

Is it just me, or does this place SMELL like a stinky toilet bathroom???
And I'm not talking about outside, i mean inside.

It was really slow here on a Wednesday night.
I hear it gets really busy and poppin on other nights, but too bad I'm not from vegas!

Came by for some quick drinks and food.

Their happy hour is pretty good.
$5 for ALL drinks, excluding premium liquor.

Decided to go with remy and coke for $5 each.
But unfortunately the cups are super small, so it's like paying for a half drink.

Tried the bulgogi fries. They were okay. Too much nacho cheese sauce.

Overall, place was okay."}
{"text":"Came in with a group and just drank soju. We ordered peach, yogurt and watermelon.  I liked yogurt the best.  Will not order watermelon again as it was a bit sour.  They have a really good happy hour and the food looks legit.  There are also karaoke rooms and a bar and a few tables in the front.  It's a chill place to drink."}
{"text":"No longer named Zizzy but now called Western Soondae, this small restaurant features all the traditional Korean food favorites.  The place looks very dark from the outside from the heavily tinted windows but is actually quite well lit in the small dining room inside with a bar.   Apparently, this used to be one of the go-to spots in Vegas for karaoke and drinks, but now seems much quieter and more family-friendly featuring full meals and table service, not just appetizers and drinks.  I have no idea if there is still karaoke or not seeing as how no one was singing there tonight.  

All three of us had the Hot Spicy Threaded Beef Soup which was very tasty.  Fearing the worst, I asked for only medium spicy and, honestly, I wish I had kept my mouth shut since the soup was missing the characteristic delicious BURN that I so love about Korean soups.  Each giant bowl (seriously where did they find bowls this HUGE??) was served with a small bowl of white rice on the side.  We were also served 3 different kinds of homemade pickles and kimchi for the banchan and a small side of cold japchae.  The banchan and the japchae were absolutely delicious and I only wish we had been offered more of them throughout the meal, as I'm accustomed to at all the other Korean restaurants I've ever been to...and a refill of the water container at our table.  The server was a very kind older Korean man but the extent of our interaction consisted of him taking our order and dropping off the food at our table when it was ready.  We were the only people in the restaurant for about half of our meal and he spent the entire time after dropping off our food somewhere in the back completely out of sight, only reappearing when other customers (all Korean) arrived.  Maybe he is not very confident in his English because he was very friendly and engaging with the Korean customers, not a bit like he was with us.  Thankfully, the food was very good so we had no reason to call him back to our table except for the empty water container.  At any rate, I believe we will definitely go back in the future to try other items on the menu, especially since they are open until 4 am!!"}
{"text":"Feels like I'm in Ktown in LA. I really enjoyed this place when I came here! I do wish we did karaoke but hanging out the bar was fun too. 

We ordered the yogurt, peach, and mango soju! All tasted great and not too sugary. The bartender was great too! He was very attentive and great to talk to. 

We ordered the bulgogi fries it wasn't my favorite.

Otherwise, I love this place!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst Karaoke places I've been to. I'm a karaoke nut and this place was lacking for a few reasons. The bar doesn't have karaoke, so you have to purchase a room. The rooms are extremely stuffy. The song choices are severely lacking. The books are mostly in Japanese (So not Americana friendly Karaoke), and the machine was broken, so we couldn't line up songs ahead of time. Had to enter them as soon as someone's song was done. In addition (And this is just me being a nitpicky Karaoke girl) the videos don't match what you're singing. There is just a long string of random videos that aren't connected to any song in  particular. So my friend is singing \"Like a Virgin\" and there is a video of a child playing a violin, while an old man looks on. **Awkward** LOL The only redeeming thing about this place was the food."}
{"text":"This was kind of an odd place. Perhaps we were just too early, but there were only 3 other people in there, and I think they were all friends of the bartender and server. The bar is rather small, and there are a couple of booths, then of course the kareoke rooms. 90s/2000s hip hop was playing, which I appreciated, but surprised me. Wedding Crashers was playing on one of the TVs, and No Strings Attached was on the other. No complaints, but again, strange. 

The best thing was that the bathroom was clean- actually, it smelled strongly of bleach. A good thing, too, because I dropped my cell phone in the toilet. Eeeek!!!!! I was truly horrified, but if the bathroom had been nasty, I may have had to sacrifice it. Luckily, my phone survived.

Anyway, I wouldn't go out of my way to return, but it could have been worse."}
{"text":"Zizzy's came in clutch after seeking some Korean grub and also karaoke in Las Vegas' Chinatown. I called and made reservations the Thursday night I came in just in case. Upon coming in nobody was here which was fine.. sweet! The utensils they provided initially were for 2 people but we had a party of 4, so I had to ask for more. The menu selection was sort of weak. Unfortunately the two things I wanted, they didn't have, bummer. 

Overall, this this place was fun and we  enjoyed our 3 hours of karaoke in the private room sharing apps and having drinks.~ 

-$15/hr karaoke room 
- Happy hour 6-9
-Yummy potstickers soft with a crunch, warm and tasty with dipping sauce!
-Sampler was just okay: had 2 mozzarella sticks, 2 jalapeno poppers, French fries, 4 onion rings
-DRINKS: ordered beer and a cocktail; he didn't know how to make the cocktail listed on his menu, but I told him the recipe after googling it.
-Yummy bulgogi fries, opted for regular bulgogi, but he suggested fries because he had no rice for the bulgogi entree order
- No lemon parmesan wings, so tried the wings with honey mustard and bbq sauces.. wings were good 
-Mango soju pitcher, delicious and went down smooth
-Friendly owner!!"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for the weekend for my friend's bachelorette party and stopped here on Saturday before we went out. It happened to be happy hour, and I could not be happier with the experience.

We got 3 bottles of Nigori sake, and an hour of karaoke for $15. I shit you not. $15!!! Our bride also got a free shot of patron at the bar. The staff was really nice. They don't have a huge selection of songs, but for the service and the positive experience we had at that kind of price, this place is amazing."}
{"text":"SO LONG HAPPY HOUR! My friends and I have been frequenting this hidden gem for years solely because of their kick ass happy hour. So we show, after work, eat, drink, and be happy.... Until the bills come! Wow, no more happy hour? No warning? And no significant menu change? Not cool, at all! We seriously left feeling completely blindsided.. Still hungry.. And not buzzed.. But definitely broke. When we questioned it, the staff was super nice about it, but still- should have been notified. We will find a new happy hour spot that doesn't smell like bleach, have a busted toilet and non-air conditioned karaoke rooms. Boy, bye!"}
{"text":"Oh Zizzy! One of my best places to go and have a few drinks. I have only been their for karaoke once. Most of the time it has been to just hang out at the bar and munch on some food. 

Speaking of food, they have one of the best bulgogi fries I have tasted in Las Vegas! Don't let those terrible pictures on yelp destroy your appetite (most likely due to the dark lighting), try some for yourself. I have also had just the regular fries which are good, and the fried chicken which was just ok. 

The best time to come is happy hour, get yourself a yogurt soju and bulgogi fries = a good time with friends!"}
{"text":"This place is great for small (4) to medium (10) groups or potentially larger. They have great food. Try the Korean BBQ Platter. It comes out sizzling like fajitas at Chillis. Their happy hour specials are great and even thought they have long wait times there's a small lobby with booths to sit and wait. 

I had the best birthday celebration here. It was a fantastic venue for people to come and let loose."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for karaoke. 

I went with this past Saturday with a group of 4 girls. Someone in our group had reserved a private room, which costed $20/hour - super reasonable. The rooms are a decent size, and hold about 12 people comfortably. The only downside is there selection of songs. It's incredibly outdated and you won't find much of a variety. It's mostly pop and classic rock. I was really looking forward to singing some Shania, but no. Not here. 

With updates this place could easily become 4 stars, but as of now I'd skip it."}
{"text":"I felt the need to be a rockstar (lol) so ended up here to get a room. When we first walked in, the female bartender said the karaoke rooms were full. I went to the bathroom and saw an empty room. Shouldn't she check before saying that? The male employee said there was a room available shortly after. It's a tiny place and they have maybe 5-7 rooms? It took forever to get our drinks. I pressed the service button a few times and no one came. I went out to the bar and the bartender looked flustered and wasn't very helpful and to ask the male employee.

A lot of our songs would stop in the middle. I told the male bartender. He didn't seem to care and told me to tell the other employee. I guess he felt bad and later, they came to reset it and it finally worked. One of the male employees who wasn't a bartender was nice.

The only good thing about this place are the chicken wings. They need to work on their service skills because it's clearly lacking and make sure the machines are working."}
{"text":"Somehow we all decided to come karaoke! This is the second time I have set foot in this spot... Walking in, a certain scent invades my nose - it's a toilet bowl. Not cool. We get walked back to our karaoke room. We then had to wait about twenty minutes for our microphones. Why? Because they had to charge! Shouldnt a karaoke place have supplies ready for their patrons to use??!! After we waited we all sang for a bit and then: one of the microphones died in mid-song! WOW!!! I would think shit would work in their venue since we were paying for the karaoke room... 
We also ordered french fries, apparently there were \"seven\" orders in front of ours but it still took about thirty minutes. A little long to drop some fries in some hot oil.
Anyway, the staff was nice enough but the karaoke could have been A LOT better experience."}
{"text":"So this place was super fun. The music was trendy. The drinks are cheap. But the food was good at the time but my boyfriend and I had food poisoning from the chicken."}
{"text":"This place was so fun!  It's prices are fine, and drinks are standard price. They have a pretty good happy hour, with an extensive drink menu. Great time to go. 
The people behind the bar were nice and friendly. Although they either ignored the button in our room, or it didn't work.  It was fine tho, we just had someone go out and order the drinks, they brought them all back to us. 
The videos are kinda weird that they play, but they are good to laugh and talk about. They have a good selection of songs, but they need to add more.  Some classics weren't programmed and that was a bummer. But there were plenty of other songs. Mostly all pop and classic 80's 90's. 
The room was a fine size with fun lights and it was a little hot, but not uncomfortable. 
If u like karaoke and drinks, I would say this place is a go!"}
{"text":"This is used to be one of the Vegas locals spot for Karaoke and Drinks. 

Staff- I actually had friends or friends had friends that worked here from time to time, and staff has always been nice and so have the owners.

Drinks - Good prices and good pours.

Venue - Looks very small and it is but actually goes in far back enough to allow a few rooms in the place. Place is just simple with a small bar and waiting area.

Would come back if I had friends wanting to check it out."}
{"text":"Went here last night and it smelled like ass (no exaggerations). The smell hit us as soon as you walked in the door. I can't even begin to explain you how bad the smell was. It was a mix of a broken bathroom and rotten eggs. I hate leaving bad reviews but it was that bad. I'm surprised there were a few people at the bar. This isn't the type of smell that is going to go away either. Something is seriously wrong. Word of advise, stay away...or at least stay outside."}
{"text":"It's was our first time here. Friend of ours Brian. Said this place is new and sound is really good. We came and tried it out. We arrive around 8:30 and left around 1:30. Within 5 hours, we had two grey goose and one cirque peach vodka. We all singed and had fun. Good thing the environment was clean, neat and friendly. Most KTV lounge I was disgusted by the nasty bathroom. This location bathroom was clean.

Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This was actually a pretty cool karaoke place, I've only ever been to one other karaoke place and it wasn't a private room so it was nice that we were in a private room so not everyone can hear and I also like that we came at the end of happy hour so we saved some money! But I wish we would have come during the whole happy hour it would have been more fun to save more money!"}
{"text":"Fun little karaoke bar in the heart of Chinatown on spring mountain. Several rooms of all different sizes to fit your singing entourage. Half full bar with enough to get you to sing a few classics"}
{"text":"The food here is great. The waiters are funny and the prices are really good. With so many options in Chinatown you never know what you're going to get. Good find."}
{"text":"Great service with a great atmosphere. I have not tried there Karaoke yet but Im sure it's not bed."}
{"text":"John was an awesome bartender! He gave us awesome customer service and a awesome time!! This spot is highly a recommended for drinks and singing!!"}
{"text":"Was here over the weekend to drink and sing!

This place has relatively small size lobby but can fit decent amount of people. I believe it has 5 karaoke rooms which varies in size.

The room I stayed in was room #5. I would like to give better rating stars but the room we stayed STANK!!!!! It smelled horrible.....

However, the cost of the place was very very affordable. I believe we drank about 8-10 bottle of cocktail soju and sang for 2-3hrs and total came out to be around $140-150. 

Staff were nice and it was really nice to have service button next to the doors to call them to your room for service. 

I just wish that the place was a bit cleaner and updated their karaoke machines with newest hits.

Overall, it was \"A-OK\""}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong. Their happy hour is awesome! Their service... not so much. 

I went there one evening around 8pm, which is usually not happy hour anymore, but Zizzy's happy hour is from 5 to 9pm, so that's awesome for people who have weird shift hours! :)

I ordered some sushi. I had to go up to the bar counter to order because the two waiting bartenders were busy texting and talking to each other. Nevertheless, I finally was able to make my order. Their sushi comes from Kaya, the Korean AYCE sushi house next door. As my suspicion was confirmed, they are both owned by the same owners. 

Sushi was pretty good. I ordered the salmon skin roll, Philadelphia (so I like cream cheese and salmon and no I'm not Jewish) roll, and the spicy tuna roll. I have had KAYA many times, so I knew it would be solid. 

Their yogurt soju was really yummy. It's slightly carbonated as they add 7-Up to liven up your taste buds. 

As I walked to the back for the restroom, I passed by some karaoke rooms and it looks like they have a large selection of Korean and English songs to choose from. The restroom was out of paper towels, so I air dried on my walk back. 

Although their drinks and their food were 4 stars, their service was very poor. There was no attention paid to our table, even when we were trying to give them money, we also had to go up to the bar to pay, but I know that's not the protocol because I saw them drop the check off at other tables. 

I might be back one more time to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I would say that they are ok for now."}
{"text":"Zizzy offers all the necessary ingredients for successful renditions of the latest K-Pop.  Soju + OB + cheap room rates = blackouts... good times."}
{"text":"i love this place....really really good drinks and fun singin at the top of my (horrible) lungs!!!"}
{"text":"sometimes i am embarrassed to admit it but i am such a fob. i have a way of finding myself in korean joints wherever i go, and vegas was no different. after a long night of being pushed and shoved in vegas \"it\" spots, my friend and i just wanted to be left alone and find a place where we can enjoy our drinks in peace. 
we hopped in our car and off we drove through and out of the strip and found ourselves front of the large blue neon sign \"zizzy.\" 

zizzy is a typical ktown karaoke bar/cafe. 
food: it was after 2am, and this girl's gotta watch her figure so food for me.
drinks: they also serve cocktails but i don't trust koreans with cocktails. soju ($13-14) and beer ($7/hite beer)  cost about $1 more than typical places in la ktown. fruit juice, coffee, and tea (typical cafe drinks) are also available. 
layout: there are about 6-7 tables with comfy chairs and a bar in the front. there are private karaoke rooms in the back.
atmosphere: dim lights... fobby kpop music... it should feel very familiar to you if you've been to ktown joints. 
\"service\": service in a korean slang term here refers to free food or free alcohol served to keep the customers happy. they give dry salted peanuts as \"service'
karaoke: the small room costs $25/hr. the music selection is once again very typical (mostly Korean songs, some Japanese and limited English songs), but the sound system is horrible. 

now back to my story...
we sat at the lounge/bar section and ordered our drinks at first and then we decided to try the karaoke. two girls in a small karaoke room singing (it's more like yelling for me) our hearts out, dancing around the room, and shaking the tambourines for almost two hours... we definitely scared the waiters. as we were leaving, i saw their frightened eyes trailing us out the door.  

i would give this place 4stars but the disco light in our room was out and they didn't do anything about it. we asked if we could change our room since it wasn't a busy night and seemed like they had other rooms available but they told us that they didn't have anymore small rooms left and they refused to do anything about. 
karaoking without the disco light doesn't complete the real karaoke experience hence the minus one star."}
{"text":"We came to this place for karaoke but decide to enjoy some drinks and food. Unfortunately the food was cold and service was poor. The server/bartender/hotress/manager/promoter was very busy entertaining friends instead of providing service."}
{"text":"Like an episode from \" Cheers\" everyone knows my name and most importantly I know everyone there! The karaoke rooms are always clean with a large selection of songs to choose from, you can sing all night long.  If your hungry, They serve food from next door at Sushi Kaya.  Drinks prices can be bit cheaper considering the space isn't that big but at least you can bring your own hookah so that's a plus. Over all its a cozy little spot to chill at and the crowd and staff are all friendly!  BANG!"}
{"text":"Came during happy hour and sat at the bar. All drinks were half off. I was there for hours and my bill was insanely cheap. The bulgogi fries were really good. Definitely would be my go-to spot for happy hour drinks in Chinatown."}
{"text":"As if there isn't enough to do in Vegas, our crew hit up this place around 3am after the Foundation Room and rocked it til 6.  When I asked the staff in the morning what time they usually close, they quitely said 4:30-5...haha.  Maybe the girls with us and the ginormous amount of alcohol and food we ordered bought us the extra hour?  Anyways, the food was decent (dukbokki and taenjang chigae) and the small \"service\" dishes were too but I can't remember much.  The selection of music was better than \"bazic\" but the sound system sucked.  Anyhow, one of four k norebangs in LV that you can end your night/morning at."}
{"text":"Fun hang out place after work. I usually come here for some drinks and laughter with some friends. They bartenders and waiters are super funny. Love their happy hour and their mixed soju's. That combination creeps up on you."}
{"text":"If I'm not at Bazic, I'm here. My friends and I used to bounce back and forth between Zizzy and Bazic at least once a month. I even threw a birthday party here one year! Zizzy has a great happy hour and good selection of songs for karaoke. The only downside lately is that God awful sewage smell! I hope they take care of that soon. :/"}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and always helpful! This place gets pretty busy in the weekends, so make sure you are ready for a crowd because this place isn't very big. Happy Hour is from 6-9pm and includes: Select $5 shots & beers, $2 off food items, $2 off other drinks, and $5 off karaoke rooms! Great place to have fun and make great friends!"}
{"text":"Went here for karaoke with some friends. It is located in a plaza with very limited parking. Good thing is there are lots of late night places for food. I am going to try out the AYCE sushi place and I'll write a review about it.

When you first walk in you will see the bar which consists of only 4 seats lol. When I walked in, I thought I went into the wrong place, but the rooms are just down the hallway. Just tell the bartender you are there for karaoke and he will take you to a room. They also have a small selection of snack foods and drinks. Price was $15 per hour which is similar to the other karaoke place I have been to. Only thing that sucked about my experience was the occasional feedback from the microphones which was annoying. The song selection is pretty old by about a year or so. They have a good selection of English songs, but they could work on updating and expanding their selection. I'd go here again mainly because of the convenience of the nearby restaurants. If the microphone problem happens again when I go, I will update my review."}
{"text":"Came for karaoke on a delirious trip. We were looking for J karaoke but came in here instead because we didn't pay attention from deliriousness. Perhaps it should have been for their food or drinks. So this review is for their karaoke side. It's got old songs...they don't have newer options. A lot of korean songs which is expected since it's a korean place. We don't know if there are new korean songs since we can't read korean. Sad English and other languages' selections. I didnt expect the Indonesian songs to be big but they have really waaayy old indonesian songs that nobody under 40 sings lol but probably most places are like that so that's not a complain. The mandarin is like 90s selection. The english is same story. The newest is probably from year 2004. We always have fun in karaoke places nonetheless.. And price for the room is really cheap."}
{"text":"OMG did you just eat somewhere and want to burn those Vegas calories?! This is your place and you don't have to embarrass yourself in front of a bunch of people, I dragged my ever so reluctant hubby into this place. We didn't eat just ordered a bunch of Mellon ball drinks and sang the night away. It was just us in our own private booth and the guys at the bar were helpful and brought our drinks over in a timely matter. It's definetly got that dive bar feel, and I am happy to say I didn't use the restroom here. Some popular songs we wanted to sing weren't on the track lists and the songs we did sing were not accurate lyrics but who cares, it was fun and we got into it."}
{"text":"Have been here several  times before  and the costumer service is great especially from a serever/bartender named jay he has great communication skills and is very friendly and makes the best alcoholic beverages  he never dissapoints with his costumer service  wich is why i always come back often."}
{"text":"It was ok. I mean, it wasn't Bazic or anything. lol (I'm such a Bazic Elitest).

Soju was cheap, which is always good. 
But, I wonder how much soju was, actually, in there because my friends and I bought must've been 7 bottles of soju in an hour half span and I was still standing.
3 bottles at Bazic get me blurry.

Soju was presented in a Patron bottle which was a nice/cool touch; BUT, the bottle was soooooo sticky. Obviously because it spilled out when being poured in.

Whatevs. Meet me at Bazic up the road."}
{"text":"Cute little place hidden in a shopping center. Song selection is old, but definitely has the classics that you need for karaoke. Hourly rate was very reasonable ($25 per hour for a large room up to 24 people?) and soju cocktails were yummy. Go for the lychee soju! We planned to stay for 2 hours and ended up staying for 5, lol. :D"}
{"text":"John was our bartender! We had a grest night even though i sound like a dying giraff. He made us feel comfortable like home, in orange county!"}
{"text":"Another Korean joint, if you're into this type of scene.  The Duk Bok Gi is great here.  The Korean chicken wings aren't as much.  I do like the kimchi tofu though.  The atmosphere is dark as always.  Music playing.  It has a slick decor with music playing a bit loud in the background.  Drink prices are fair I guess.  Food's a bit more than other Korean places.  Karaoke rooms are nice.  There's one that I know of in Z2 and a few in Zizzy which are across from each other."}
{"text":"Even though our group decided to go on a busy Saturday evening. The staff was friendly and helpful especially going over the control panels to activated the karaoke system and adjusting the music and microphone volumes for our preference. The venue is small with a total of 5 karaoke rooms in various sizes compared to others in the valley but everything is clean and organized when we went."}
{"text":"My Recommendation: Sweety Roll 

Love this place mainly because the bar tenders. They were so sociable, something rarely found in asian restaurants. 
All the drinks were good. Even the ones they created on the spot. The music was poppin' and even the other customers were friendly."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when we were waiting to eat at Sushi Kaya just a few doors down in the shopping center. This place looks pitched black from the outside, but on the inside you'll find a retro korean karaoke bar, not your average korean bar. Being from out of town, this bar is a little more initiate than other korean bars I've been to. Granted it was a Wednesday night so we were the only ones in there the entire time we were there.

Our bartender Matt was awesome! He was still in training but I wouldn't have guessed if he hadn't told us. I ordered a Midori sour and my boyfriend got a beer. They have happy hour specials from 6-9 and after 9pm too. We didn't have a whole lot of time to spend in here, but if we did we probably would have taken more advantage of those happy hour specials!

They have private karaoke rooms for those of you that like to sing or are looking to have a good time. Everything inside was neat, clean, and very pleasant. I can see how busy this place could get on a weekend. 

Parking can be scarce in the small parking lot they have, but there are spaces available in the back of the building too. I'm glad we got to try this place out so we know where to come for karaoke when we come back!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Zizzy's and my last experience justifies why I like it here so much. In the years past I would always pick Zizzy's as my go to karaoke spot, I even celebrated my 20th birthday here. Yah long time ago considering I'm in my mid-twenties now. A few weeks ago I came here on a Friday night to the bar (not for karaoke) while waiting for a table at Kaya. They were rather low on their inventory because there were several drinks we requested, but did not have the liquor to make those drinks. Oh man, we were in a bind then I remembered Zizzy's has awesome Soju drinks. And I was right! We ordered strawberry and it was delicious. It was fairly large size since it came in a patron bottle. Kinda odd for me, but I'll take it? The bartenders Justin and Andy were pretty awesome too! They were both friendly and prompt at making our drinks, which is the reason I am giving them 5 stars. I didn't realize till I checked Yelp that we came during happy hour which is why our soju was only $9, what a deal! Mind you my friend and I shared this drink and we were both pretty buzzed from it. I will definitely be coming here to pre-game before hitting up the club. Plus, I heard ownership will be changing and will be making changes for the better. Something to look forward to!"}
{"text":"Dope place. Nice to prefunk or afterfunk here. This spot never lets me down. Still feel like I'm partying no matter what time of day."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying...Sonja is awesome!  She is one of the best bartenders my husband and I have encountered in a while!  Sonja explained the menu to us, made some very helpful suggestions and frequently checked on us.  We had such a nice chat with her and we are definitely going back!  

All of the food is fresh and tasty.  We went very plain and simple.  Just ordered the shrimp tempura and a California roll.  May I say that my new favorite drink is Soju!  First we ordered the peach, followed by strawberry then Sonja suggested this flavor that tasted just like an Orange Creamsicle.  OMG!  So tasty and fun!  

I would definitely come here for their happy hour or just an evening on the town.  It's tucked back into a shopping center in China Town.  We didn't go for the karaoke rooms but it looked like they were filling up and people were enjoying themselves.

Looking forward to returning to this tiny but sweet bar!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and not at all worth it for drinks. If you just want to do karaoke it's not too bad. Also it smells really bad in here not sure if they have plumbing issues."}
{"text":"The new owner has really turned this place into the spot to be at! The all around vibe is chill but can get turned up at any time and the staff is always friendly and fun to be around!

Food: Bulgogi fries are a must try! You won't regret it!
Drinks: The bar is pretty well stocked and they have a decent selection of beer. Soju cocktails for the whole group are always fun and moderately priced. Best cocktail has got to be Marlan's Bitches and Cream or the Panty-dropper! Don't leave without trying it :)

The Karaoke: The song selection caters to every language! Spanish, Japanese, Filipino, Russian, whatever! The rooms have lights and wireless microphones so everyone can be comfortable while they get down with their friends."}
{"text":"Went here for HH -- hours are 6-9. 

We really wanted to try their soju for HH and were not disappointed. For $7.50, the cocktail soju was served in Patron-sized bottles -- it probably was a Patron bottle, come to think of it. I've had better yogurt soju but you can't beat the price. I feel like it's a bit diluted though -- not much for the buck. 

We also ordered kimchi fried rice and the mussels, all delivered from the sushi place next door. (food violation, much?) The rice is a pass, but the mussels are delicious. It states only 3 pieces, but it's actually 5. Sweet deal for $2.50. 

We came at 7pm, and there was only one other party there. The bartender was more aloof than helpful, but nothing surprising for a Korean karaoke joint. My main problem was that it was 100+ degrees outside and it was not better on the inside. Even if there are only two parties in the room, please turn on the AC. It was really too hot to truly enjoy the food. 

Great place to hang out with a large group of people (hopefully with AC), I didn't smell any \"toilet smell\", excellent HH deals."}
{"text":"Are you down to hydrate your non-alcohol-filled self? Well, you got a choice of hitting up the strip where a drink will cost you $8-$15, or you can go to PT's, or you can hit up this super quaint, but hole-in-the-wall type neighborhood spot. 

I was a bit skeptical coming in here, as there are not many places to sit. You come here with a group of people to take advantage of their drinks, and then maybe enjoy some karaoke while you're at it. 

Cocktails are modestly priced at about $4-$6. They have some great HH deals from 6-9p.m., where all drinks are 50% off, food is $2 off, and karaoke is $5 off/hour. I got to know the bartenders there (Jen and Justin) who are super cool, and I had a great time swapping really random stories, which I can hardly recall. 

Try the soju mixed drinks. It comes in a bottle where they mix half a bottle of soju with a ton of other flavors ranging from mango, strawberry, melon, yogurt, to apple and more. I didn't think it'd taste good, but it was surprisingly easy to go down, and does the job if you wanna let loose. The karaoke is a bit outdated, and they don't have the newest songs on file, but if you just want to sing some classics and some semi-recent songs that are maybe 6 months old, then you're good. 

I had a sampler, and it was really yummy. It came with onion rings, jalapeno poppers, chicken strips, and some other stuff, This is a super local, neighborhood joint, immediately next to Tea Station. I highly doubt I would have ever known about this place unless some local had brought it up. I think my review is super biased based on their HH because it can't be beat. This is my current fave spot in vegas for a true drink fest."}
{"text":"We've been going to Zizzy's and Z2 for a few years now. Its conveniently located under the ever popular Ichiza. We're used to running that circuit. 

One of the cool things about this place is you can buy a bottle (of Johhny, Belvedere, whatever) and they'll locker it up for you for thirty days. So you pay for the bottle of booze and every time you come in, you just drink from that bottle, no more tabs (just tip!). Not that we've ever done that ... 

It was only recently that we began hitting up Zizzy's with a large enough crew to karaoke. 

The best thing about this place is they have private rooms. Not that I'm ashamed of wailing out in public. But its annoying hearing other people sing. I really don't care about people outside of my circle of trust. 

This place is the devil. Once the apple soju and Hite beers start a-flowin', they never stop. Its especially asinine coming after Sapporos and sake upstairs at Ichiza. And I think they strategically give you salty bar nuts so you keep drinking. I've grown accustomed to paying a $60+ share of the bill. But then again, we normally karaoke for an upwards of five hours. Karaoke is the new strip club. 

Their music selection is weird. They have some Journey (in my opinion, Journey is the ultimate karaoke music), one lesser known Bjork song, and a lot of Stryper. I don't know that they have much Viet songs (as another Yelper mentioned), but there's a lot of Korean and a some Japanese songs. 

The service is always friendly, but I recommend having a native Korean speaker in your group. Makes things easier. 

I leave when the sun comes up or my bf passes out, which ever comes first. Some how these two events seem to coincide. 

* non-casino, off the strip"}
{"text":"God: Great service, good song selection, easy to user equipment. Happy hour specials. Bad: Smelled like sewer. They probably had a plumbing issue that evening."}
{"text":"He asked us to leave at 3:15am (45 mins till closing) because it's a \"slow night\" on a Friday night and because he wants to go home. He said also bc no one else is here but ppl tried to come in as we were paying him and he just kicked them out too."}
{"text":"I've came here a couple times and it's always a good time. They have happy hour on drinks and food which is always a plus. The only downfall was every time I've came here I was never asked to show my ID to sing karaoke and the one time I forgot it at home they refused to give my party and I a room. I understand rules are rules but I was definitely caught off guard since my previous visits I was never asked to show my ID to sing only to purchase alcohol."}
{"text":"After trying a few other karaoke locations and them being either closed for renovations or fully booked we came upon Ziggy's. We had a group of about 12 people and were easily able to get our own private room on a Saturday around 11 pm. 

The videos were definitely interesting to say the least, but the song selection was very wide ranged, lots of English songs. They had a pretty decent food menu which was nice as well. We ended up sharing some of the jalapeño poppers, bulgogi fries, nachos and potstickers. I'd have to recommend the fries the most. They were delicious and the portion size was huge! 

I'd definitely come back here again. The staff was super friendly, food was good and the pricing was very reasonable."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in vegas! They have a wide selection of alcohol along with some of the funnest bartenders you'll ever meet.  There's a few TVs by the main bar area playing the latest movies, sports or whatever the customers want.  The prices are very reasonable and the bartenders definitely know how to hook it up.  Every now and then they'll do special events with live DJs, ufc fights, etc.  They have happy hour from 6pm to 9pm EVERYDAY which is unheard of!  The karaoke rooms are fun, affordable, cozy and perfect if you want to get rowdy or just feel like singing your heart out.  Bring your crowd of friends or come by yourself to just unwind and you'll be taken care of by their awesome bartenders Justin, Angela, Marlon, Andy or Joseph.  On top of everything, the best part about zizzys and also the main reason I come back is for the ambience.  Everything from the lighting, music, design, vibes...you'll have a good time here no matter what."}
{"text":"Seriously, how come I hadn't been here before?! This place is awesome!

Here's how it works: you pay a certain amount of money per hour (depending on the room size, but the lowest price is $15/hour). Each room has two mics, a tambourine, a very Korean keyboard for controlling the tv/karaoke system, and of course the awesome hardware. They have a lot of Asian music, but also a lot of cool American songs you know all the words to. Also, each room has a button you push to summon the bartender, who will very quickly return with your alcohol of choice. I had soju for the first time ever, and I loved it!

Anyway. They (of course) have Journey, Queen, Maroon 5... a bunch of stuff. And since it's private, the other rooms can't hear how crappy you sing! It's great!

The bar outside also seems to be really full-service, though I didn't stray from soju. And the shopping center it's in is really awesome, too, home to Ichiza and Kaya sushi. Win all around!"}
{"text":"This was my first karaoke. My family was in town and wanted to go. Prices were great and rooms were clean. We also had some drinks from the bar that weren't bad. Jen was great and helpful as I had no idea what I was looking for or how to use their system. Not bad though. If I had to entertain karaoke again, I'd go back."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden gem. My friends and I were looking for a bar to have sake before sushi next door at sushi kaya.  We had a melon soju that was made with soju Midori and sprite. It was so delicious. It came in a patron bottle. It was a large bottle. Our bartender was very nice and joined in the conversation and made our experience very personal and friendly. I will be back for karaoke and to say what's up to our friendly bartender. It was happy hour. Our bill was $21 left $32."}
{"text":"Favorite place to just chill with friends or after work for a couple drinks. The staff is awesome - super friendly and will make pretty much any drink you can come up with. If you're in the area, definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went here both before and after Ichiza one night. We were there before because Ichiza had a bit of a wait. We thought the place was pretty nice, so we came back afterward for some more drinks. OK the truth is, one of my friends had a thing for the bartender, so he insisted that we return.

We were only in the front bar area, but I understand there are karaoke rooms in the back. The front area is small and was empty when we were there. The bartenders are very nice and friendly, I'm not sure I would recommend the place based on my experience, but it's definitely a chill little bar. A-OK in my book."}
{"text":"This is a hip and trendy little Korean karaoke/bar/lounge in the heart of China Town! Usually gets pretty packed on weekends with a mixed crowd! I would suggest coming for Happy Hour 5-9 (half off select food and drinks!) They get their food from over at Kaya Sushi so you know it's going to be pretty good! As far as drinks go.. definitely try the yogurt soju (served in a Patron bottle) taste yummy but can be deadly!!! Or have one of the awesomely HOT bartenders (Sonya, Young, Justin) whip up something special for you! So whether you want to rock out on the mic in a private room, get hammered at the bar or just meet some cool new people this place is a great choice! 

The only con: parking can be tight and crazy~"}
{"text":"I love coming here with friends! So much fun & the drinks are good. :)"}
{"text":"My group of kareokeholics spontaneously decided to hit the mikes in vegas and we found Zizzy's. Half expecting this place to suck, I was more surprise than ever. I love the room decor, happy hour prices (not sure why Yelp has this as $$$). Compare to SF prices, it is more like a $ ($7.50 an hour). The food/soju was also half off. We sang everything from \"Wild One\" to \"Don't Stop Believing\". One star was dock for the paper books. It should be computerized to save time from all that flipping. Also, one of the mikes needed to be charged so we only had one mike to use towards the end. 

A bonus: our bride to be received a free patron shot from the female bartender"}
{"text":"Best pre game bar in Vegas! Justin is cool, so is Jennifer! A+ it's really a good spot if you feel like getting wasted without being in a over crowded place. Vibe is great and the music is even better. I went to other karaoke place and they just don't compare!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food, amazing happy hour,  and reasonable prices on drinks!! Our favorites here are jay and Stella! They are such amazing bar tenders and are attentive to all of mine and my friends needs!! :)

Their flavored soju (watermelon, peach, and yogurt) are my favorite flavors! Packed with a semi sweet taste and a burst of flavor.

I love the interior of this place, what's awesome is that it doubles as a karaoke bar. It contains about 6 or 7 rooms for people to sing and get boozy among each other.

Their bulgogi fries, and dumplings are amazing! Their bulgogi bbq kinda sucks because it's 90% onions with tiny bits of beef."}
{"text":"My friends and I would always go to Zizzy's for happy hour and have some drinks and food and just catch up on times but the last time we were there, our bills were outrageous.  Apparently, without saying a word to us, they cancelled happy hour so nothing was half price.  Having such a great deal for so long, they really need to have this posted somewhere obvious because there is no way in hell we're going to spend $80 on a few drinks and appetizers.  Won't be going back there ever again which is sad because we always had a fun time.  Bring the happy hour back, and you will have a full crowd again!"}
{"text":"Zizzy is one of my favorite places. Every time I come to town I make it a point to visit. The staff is friendly, fun, and always put a smile on your face. The drinks are good, the Bulgogi Fries are to die for, and the yogurt Soju is so tasty. This place is fun to pregrame, karaoke, or to even stay the whole night meeting new people or partying with your friends. Eat, Drink, Sing and be Merry!"}
{"text":"I am just a simpleton who loves his Jameson and Sake. Fortunately for me....this amazing establishment serves BOTH!!! the happy hour is killer, the staff is amazing, and I have yet to try actually karaoke-ing at this spot. But when I do, I'm pretty sure I'll have a GREAT FXCKING TIME especially with my JAMESON AND SAKE!! For having both, I wish I could give y'all ten stars. Fxck it, 20! What else could I add without sounding repetitive....OH!! ....Jameson and sake"}
{"text":"Good ambiance.... my friend said he first started coming here in 2004, when they were just starting out and before the owner bought out the sushi place next door.  He said it's come a long way since then. This place has a great, relaxed atmosphere... there are karaoke rooms for fobby gatherings.  I would come here again if given the chance.  The peach soju = :)"}
{"text":"I'm little older than most... all I know is that when was there today, which was early, 20 something was the main. I was hoping for little more mix of age and more people but than again it was Sunday and early. Maybe next time. Food was ok for bar food, drink... I had beers,  but they were out of what I wanted. =("}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here to karaoke after a great meal on the strip. My brother and his girlfriend live in Tokyo and they love karaoke. They were super impressed with the individual booths for us to embarrass ourselves haha! But definitely a good time! Service was great they have bells you can ring of you need anything.
They Krin Ichiban which is an awesome Japanese beer! 

Cons: the music was WAY TOO loud. We had to scream over the music to sing. I could smell the bathroom pretty good from the hall which was pretty disappointing. But overall good place to drink and be silly with your friends....maybe just don't take your family there haha! Also our mic died mid singing and they had to charge it! I thought they would have another they could just give us! But we had to wait for it to charge :(  But def would recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this spot especially their happy hour drinks. Yummy food too and good karaoke spot"}
{"text":"I always leave this place with some memorable stories. 3 stars because they do a good job, food is yummy, prices are reasonable and staff is efficient, friendly, and helpful.  This place has been open for awhile and it still looks the same. Karaoke rooms aren't the nicest, but standard looking. You have leather booths like any karaoke place and some karaoke nightclub light effects. Unfortunately, the book with the list of songs isn't updated so I was typing in ever artist I could think of in order to pick my songs... Kind of a pain because people we are singing and at the same time we are scrolling through songs on the screen. other than that they do a good job here and our crowd left pleased."}
{"text":"Super fun bar with killer soju drinks poured out of patron bottles... Delicious food too, including squid jerky!"}
{"text":"Since I'm used to LA prices, this was a pretty good deal.  $25 or so an hour to sing... $13 for a bottle of sofu.  our waiter came frequently to check up on us (bringing water).  we sang there for about 4 hours and they have current songs (somewhat).  we asked for a discount - altho they wouldn't give us one (we were drunk), they did give us free shots.  very friendly people.  The establishment is nice looking.  not that crowded, but then again, it was halloween."}
{"text":"The new zizzy is awesome! Good vibes! Good people!  & the music on top of that is always bumping! Great bartenders! Justin, Angela, Marlon, Joseph, Andy always takes care! Really good food as well. The bugolgi fries are beyond amazing! The deals here are unbeatable anywhere!! Thanks for all the good times & the good memories!"}
{"text":"Had fun...would have been five stars except: 1) not enough country selections and 2) despite the no smoking signs inside, lots of people were making it stuffy and smelly..."}
{"text":"I am Always here not only for it's familiarity but also cuz it's always a home run. This place has a really good blend of everything to me (probably hence why I'm always here). Good blend of people, food and options for things to do. Eat, drink, sing, bs with friends. Pretty great place overall and the new changes are refreshing and more consumer friendly when it comes to crowds. And those every here and there parties with open bar makes it even better :))). Idk if hash tags work here but here's what I think --#lasvegas #lv #zizzy #zizzylv #bar #chinatown #chinatownlv #vegas #bar #korean #karaoke #amazing #fun"}
