{"text":"I like thin snobby gourmet pizza.  This is probably the best pizza I've ever found in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Really great food, best in the area in my humble opinion.  Definitely a different taste profile with the coal oven but from my frequent visits yo some great pizza places in NYC, this is very authentic.  The other dishes should also not be ignored -- especially the wings.  Will go back!!"}
{"text":"Only dealt with the bartenders so I can't speak much on the full service. All I can say is the bartenders are good at their job. I usually just order a pizza and a beer. Specialty pizzas here have not intrigued me. I tend to get a cheese or pepperoni pizza. I enjoy the thin crust on their pizzas. Most places around here only do a thick traditional crust. They have a slightly better beer selection than most places around. 

On the weekends it is packed. This is a hot spot on the weekends."}
{"text":"Had dinner with wife and another couple. A pleasant experience. Good service. Sat in the outside area, which was nice. Inside had air con turned way low. Be prepared for cold. Lots of TV monitors with different channels if that is your thing. Nice beer selection. Pizza was good, with interesting combinations. Just not exceptional. Priced a little high. Again, a nice overall experience and would go back."}
{"text":"Their pizzas are delicious but if you haven't tried their meatballs you are missing out! They are as great as homemade and so good you won't want to share. Also, if you like wings then definitely try their baked wings. They bake them in a cast iron pan with onions and they are heavenly. I'm not a big onion person but they are so yummy and seasoned perfectly with the wings. 

I highly recommend this location or the Cranberry location. They both are fantastic."}
{"text":"We tried Anthony's as I had heard great things about their other locations. Great atmosphere. Interesting and visually appealing decor. Our server was courteous. They have a good vareity of toppings. We had the basic cheese pizza with prosciutto. The pizza took a decent while, but that was to be expected, as it was quite busy.
It was... ok. The prosciutto was placed on top of the cooked pizza in long slices, which is normal. The prosciutto was of decent quality. The pizza was, at best, average. I would have perhaps liked a bit more sauce, but that's personal preference. Generally, it was a rather unremarkable dining experience. Quite frankly, I was expecting something somewhat extraordinary from what I'd heard about the place, and I just didn't get that from my visit. 

PROS: Decor, service, vareity of toppings
CONS: Price (rather high for pizza), quite loud when busy"}
{"text":"Well never got too try the pizza cause waited 20 minutes for someone too wait on me and my wife , they just kept walking around and around and around us , didnt even get drinks , it wasn't even busy , then a table of 8 came in and they took there order asap ..we just got up and left , we had the feeling like , good glad those 2  left , they only want big tables , not 2 or 3 people , guess u cant spend enough too just have 2 too eat there , big waste of time too go too this place ..."}
{"text":"This was a major disappointment. I went with a few friends and noticed the pizzas immediately. I had my hopes up as the pizzas looked good and the host and wait staff appeared friendly. Seemed to be on to a good start. Then it began. The music. For some reason that perplexes me, they had a woman on keyboard singing while accompanied with a man on drums. The music was SO loud that you couldn't even carry on a conversation without yelling. This is two spots in a row where noise was an issue, but this was a totally different beast altogether. My friend and i were both flabbergasted as to why anybody would think was a good idea. The place is clearly greed towards groups of people coming in to have a meal together, but the noise makes that impossible. I left it up to the group to decide on staying or leaving. We quickly chose to ask for  the check. While 1 star may seem harsh since we didn't eat, I'm basing this on the fact that we weren't able to even stay long enough to order. If you're able to drive off a group of people, i think that justifies one star. Whomever thought that was a good idea must be deaf, high, or have a warped sense of humor."}
{"text":"I lived in NYC for a few years, but never found pizza as good as this.  We loved Lombardi's there on Spring Street, but this topped it.  Was in Vegas with my family.  Needed a late dinner and wanted to get off the strip (also wanted to save a few bucks).  Ended up going towards the Town Center and thought this would be a good choice as we'd already been to the other chains there.  For the four of us we shared a salad.  Very fresh and great dressing.  The other three got pepperoni, olive and peppers on a large.  What a ton of pizza!  I (the weirdo vegan) got a small pizza without cheese with mushrooms and hot peppers.  Vegas isn't very veg friendly, so this was an absolute delight for me.  Very crispy crust, delicious sauce, and the peppers were so unique and delicious.  The fam loved their pizza, too.  We had plenty of leftovers and the bill was only $50 for the whole table...cost the same as our breakfast at the Mandalay Bay restaurant.  Highly recommended!  Service was fantastic, too."}
{"text":"Well the service was average. The atmosphere was kind of confusing. It was as if the place didn't have an identity. They wanted to be classy, but they sold pizza. It was also too wide open, like a college hangout. Waaay too expensive for college students. I didn't particularly care about the burnt crust on the pizza either. The pics in the restrooms, waaay too raunchy for kids!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place with my hubby or girlfriends!! Salads are my favorite!! I am Italian and never eat meatballs out but these I can't resist .. Yummy and served with Ricotta cheese:) happy hour is awesome .. Especially Martinis on Wednesday.. I have a favorite bartender can't remember her name but she always remembers what I drink:)"}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese pizza and  it was horrible! How do you screw up a cheese pizza?I guess they know how?Burnt pizza with no flavor is not my thing.If I wanted to eat charcoal I would've ate a bag of Kingston briquettes. I'm sticking to Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, taste and quality.  I love the pizza, thin crust and not overly sauced.  The salad is fresh and light.  Wings have a very nice flavor, no sloppy sauces covering the taste.  The coal fired roast beef sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I have  ever had anywhere.  This is turning into one of  my favorite  restaurants"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while. Finally had the opportunity yesterday. We ordered a 14\" pizza with mushrooms, sweet peppers and onions. The pizza was tasty (nothing spectacular) and the heat from the oven gives the veggies nice crispy edges. The crust is thin and crunchy. There really isn't a \"sauce\" on the pizza, just crushed tomatoes.  Our waitress was attentive and very nice. 

However, with us only drinking water, our bill totaled $25!  For just a pizza!  

We are glad we tried this place, but doubt we will go back."}
{"text":"We always enjoy Anthony's unique crust flavor and specialty pizzas.  We enjoyed the ricotta and meatball pizza as a to go order. 

We like that the crust is actually thick enough to support a slice of pizza without collapsing. 

They are consistent every visit and look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Just decided to stop at Anthony's for the first time in McMurray,PA.  I have been to the location in Robinson, Pa before and was not to excited. However, this location was much better. The location is bigger and brighter. The staff greeted us upon our entrance and we were seated with in 10 minutes. Our waitress explained the specials and took our drink order.  The salad was fresh and the dressing was not over bearing.  Our pizza was a basic split half mushroom and sausage.  The pizza was hot and delicious. Also, the staff kept out glasses filled. Over all I would recommend this location and will go back.  Finally, there are 10 pizza locations within 2 miles, so the competition is high for pizza and subs"}
{"text":"This is my fav spot in Monroeville to eat.  The pizza is great and the salad is awesome.  Easy to eat with a group at here."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, love the wings, & especially love the ribs. If you come at peak times expect a wait for a table. Parking is usually the worst part."}
{"text":"I am not sure why the low stars in the other reviews as this place was great!

It is what it is, a really good pizza place with good service. 

I wish it wasn't so late as I would have loved to try the espresso but maybe next time I am in Pittsburgh. 

Give it a try..."}
{"text":"Party of 6, we were seated immediately & sat at our table with no service for 15 minutes. No one asked to get us drinks....NOTHING! Despite the two servers that continuously walked past us several time providing service to the tables around us."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant that has a patio, bar and dining area.  The server was extremely helpful and nice.  The pizza was excellent.  They have a yummy pumpkin beer they has cinnamon on the lip of the glass.  Would definitely recommend this place others."}
{"text":"Had they not burned the pizza it might have been good. There motto is \"Pizza well done.\" Anthony's should strive more for pizza done well. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Best pizza you will ever have! It's a little expense but worth every penny. Very clean and everybody is very friendly. Only down side is it is very loud inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"We did take out. Easy ordering, interesting menu. Ordered the Cauliflower pizza good but a little bland crust was great, hubby had Paul and Young Ron pizza tasty, and house salad, lettuce was crisp dressing was yummy. We'll have to try again.."}
{"text":"First off I'm surprised to read so many negative reviews here, hence why I am posting my experience here. I've visited Anthony's Pizza in Monroeville, PA  twice now. Once by myself and the second trip today I took my mother. Both experiences were excellent.
The pizza here is absolutely delicious. I've had almost every pizza in Pittsburgh as well as the worlds greatest pizza's in NYC (I am a huge pizza freak). I absolutely love the pizza here. Neither time was it \"overcooked\" or burned. It was charred perfectly with a black crust without having a bad taste or anything. I got a single topping both times and it was fantastic, my mother also loved it! Just be aware with any pizza place, the more toppings you load on, the harder it is to cook a pizza right. Maybe others pile theirs up which is why they come out bad?

Besides the pizza, the wings here are amazing. Perfect, homemade chicken wings. Not hard or chewy, great taste, very tender. Probably the best wings in the Pittsburgh area. it's worth coming here for the wings alone! We also got their cheesecake which my mother loved (I haven't tried it yet but I took some home).
Lastly besides the food, the service is great. The first time I visited they let me sample several beers for free and even gave me some wings to try. The waiter was great. The second trip the service was still great. The place was packed but we got our food in under 25 minutes. Excellent waiters and plenty of staff keeping the place moving.

Great food, atmosphere is nice with a very beautiful restaurant for a pizza place. The only reason I have to complain and dock a star from my rating for; the price. The prices here are ridiculous.The bill for two people came to $46. They charged me $6 for a beer and $10 for two slices of cheesecake. The pizza is pricey as well. The large pizza with a mushroom topping came to $18.70. They have no medium sized pizza (which is strange) and the large pizza I got looked like a medium you would get anywhere else. It felt like the bill should have been $35, not $46 (not including the tip even). If you're going for two (or on a date with someone) I recommend just the pizza and a couple soft drinks to not break the bank. And if you have a smartphone, go on fourquare, you can get a coupon on your phone for two free wings to sample. 
Other than the price, highly recommend this place. I think it's a very appropriate place when you want to take someone special out for pizza but to somewhere nicer besides a bar/chain restaurant. Just be careful what you spend!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service. My husband and I split a small salad and large pizza, and since it was our first visit they gave us a free small sample of their wings, which were amazing! Ordered sausage on whole pizza and prosciutto on half, pepperoni on other half. The prosciutto was thin and chewy, not baked and crisp as I would have liked, but otherwise yummy. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We first experienced Anthony's in Florida-loved it!!  So thrilled to have great pizza and wings locally.  Service was fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell...
- Beer/Wine selection was decent. Not many mixed drinks but not what they promote either. 
- Food was really great. We had the roasted cauliflower pizza. It was crisp, generous on cauliflower, seasoned perfectly.
- The service was the standout. Brandon T was our server and he was just amazing. Polite, friendly, and made us feel at home. 

Great dinner experience."}
{"text":"Live in Florida, came in with my grandpa...he loves all the photos in the place! Great food, consistent with the Anthonys down there! Server Brian was nice! And another male server was very enthusiastic and thanked us as we left, felt very genuine which is nice. I come in every time I visit and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I wasn't expecting to like this place much, but the pizza we had was fantastic and different from anything I know of in Pittsburgh.  Reminded me of a West Coast place.Good beer selection too.

Always seems to be crowded when we want to go there, which is probabaly a good sign, but can be frustrating too.  We had to sit outside on a hot day to avoid a long wait."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good.  The wings were very good.  Service was good.  I think it is a little over priced.  Didnt like that pop comes in a plastice bottle $2.99 each."}
{"text":"Pizza, Wings & Salad were good but it was soooo freezing inside the building that my husband & I had to eat with our coats on.  We looked around & other guests had their coats on as well.  We even changed tables thinking another area would be warmer.  Please turn up the heat!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings. Service sometimes a little slow but most of times not to bad. High priced so I cant give 5 stars. Attractive wait staff.."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place a 3.5. Decent pizza, good atmosphere and a simple variety of choices on the menu! I highly recommend the Eggplant Marino pizza with a glass of the Shock Top Belgian White beer. Their portions are big. So remember, if you're thinking ordering a side of the Classic Italian Salad for two - it's really not portioned for two! That bowl could easily serve 5. It's always packed in the evenings on weekends so be prepared for a fairly long wait - I would suggest trying them out during lunch."}
{"text":"Pizza is excellent, don't even like wings but their wings are unbelievable. It is a bit pricey but well worth it I think. Been there about 8 times never a bad meal."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh for the weekend, stopped by for a quick bite and beer. I had a side salad and a small Tony's Sausage and Peppers. Was advised against the hot peppers if I didn't like really hot so I caved and went with the sweet one. 

All around a very good pie. Love the usual of the 800 deg coal oven. Gives the pizza a nice well done thin crust. The burnt edges don't bother me like some other reviewers. It adds character from that hot ass oven. 

Give this pizza a chance!  Would try a plain pepperoni next time."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered we loved. Brittany n Lindsay were friendly and helpful. Our first time here won't be my last. Da bomb"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings done in the pizza oven.draft beer is always cold and the service is usually great. on our last visit we went on a thursday evening. we were seated as soon as we walked in.the normally great service was just ok this time the waitress didn't seem to friendly or interested in her job, but she got the job done. we will definitely go back one waitress does dot make or break a restaurant for us.while i would give the food 5 stars the prices are a little high and service wasnt great this time so 4 stars for now"}
{"text":"Love the pizza. Meatballs are always amazing!!  My husband and I drive all the way from Clairton to eat here. The service is always great. Love live band nights too."}
{"text":"If you want great coal fired pizza go to Grimaldis on Eastern. So maybe I'm biased because I was a fan of Grimaldis  but I went to Anthony's as a birthday event with a friend.  I was excited for it as I love the thin crispy crust of coal oven pizza. It is in Town Square which is ok but parking is a nightmare sometimes. The inside is nice and large. The wait staff is real nice.  They don't have fountain drinks? So you get a bottle at a time. That sucks. If I'm going to have to pay by the bottle then I'm going to drink beer. They only have a house salad or tomato and mozzarella, no ceasar. I'm a ceasar fan but I figured I'd enjoy the house if it's the only one it should be good right? Not really.  It was, maah ok at best and only ok because I got the Gorgonzola to top it with. The pizza toppings are about the same as Grimaldis as far as limitations but I don't mind as long as it's good. We got a meatball pizza, a white pizza, a tomato spinach pizza, and a pepperoni pizza. Yeah we tried a lot but it was a party.  The pizzas came out nice and hot but the crust is a bit more chewy and the mozz on the pizza didn't seem to be as fresh as I'd hoped for. So, I say if you're in Town square and want pizza (you must like thin crust) go to Anthonys over California Industrial Mass Produced Pizza Kitchen anytime but if you want great New York style coal fired thin crust check out Grimaldis.   Grimaldis crust is less chewy and their toppings seem to be of higher quality."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places my wife and I have gotten pizza from. The atmosphere is great. I got a couple of the mixed drinks and they were fantastic, and our order consisted of the personal lunch pizzas, two meatballs and the oven baked wings. The wings were cooked perfectly and the meatballs were some of the best I have eaten anywhere, and when we got our personal pizzas, they were significantly larger than what we expected. Toppings were generous, and the pizzas were deliciously crispy with just the right amount of grease. Our server, Bryan, was very friendly and accommodating and made our experience all the better! 
We would certainly recommend this place to friends, family, and strangers. This restaurant can expect our repeat business!"}
{"text":"After taking in a movie at Settler's Ridge on my day off, my 8 year old daughter piped up, \"Let's try Anthony's for dinner!\"  Actually, we've been meaning to try out their coal fired pizza for a while and usually we go to the area for Thai Foon.  In the mood for something different, we made the very short walk from Cinemark to Anthony's.

The 4 stars in my rating is for the food only.  Everything else might be at a 2 or 3.

The pizza was just great!  We split a large specialty pizza - one half was broccoli rabe and sausage and the other half was meatball and ricotta.  The crust was thin and just lightly burnt from the purported coal fire and the toppings were plentiful and delicious.  I would say that the topping choices on the specialty pizza offerings are very well thought out and gave us plenty of reason to return to branch out a little and try a couple of other combinations.  So, there ends the 4 star portion.

On to the rest:
- The seating area is very small.  This place is deceptively large - when you get in, there is a tiny bar area and only about seating for 50 or so.  We had a 20 minute wait and thankfully the food was worth it.
- Service was pretty off.  For a Monday night, they were so clearly understaffed.  So, long waits for simple requests like more water, extra napkins, silverware for our party of 4, and our check.
- The restaurant itself is hot.  I mean, how could it not be when \"coal fired pizza\" is in the name?  But, better ventilation would make the dine in experience go a lot smoother."}
{"text":"All I can say is, \"IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO ANTHONY'S...YOU HAVEN'T HAD THE BEST!\"  I mean it!  Best in CUSTOMER SERVICE, BEST IN ITALIAN WINGS, BEST IN CALZONES...the hubby loves their COAL FIRE flavor on every item! Let's just say everything that I or my husband tried on the menu have been top of the line.  I even tried the Apple Martini, since it was our Anniversary dinner.  Oh my wasn't that the tastiest drink, I've had since Johnnie C's Bellini!!  Every server seemed very nice and are just adorable in personality and outside too!  They have televisions and a really nice bar.  I give it my only so far...PENDANT TOP 5 STARS!!"}
{"text":"Noise level made it hard to talk to friends across the table from me.
The blasting rock music as well as the crowd noise was too much.

Ordered 2 small pizzas for the 3 of us.  One was a meatball and ricotta and the other a veggie pizza.  They were flat and bland tasting.
The blackened dough on the bottoms did not help.
17.00 for a small pizza with 6 cuts?  Seriously?

Won't be returning any time soon.

The only plus: Our waitress was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"You walk in to all of the good things that were ever said about their food plastered on the wall.  It wasn't surprising to find that the waiter was into himself just as much as the management was into themselves and their food. I ordered a salad and then found out that they only carried Italian dressing. Their meatballs are really good but the cold ricotta didn't do it for me. I wasn't a fan of their wings. The manager on duty was flirting with all of the waitresses. I just wanted to slap him. The pizza was unimaginative but tasted good. I expexted more for the amount that I paid. It goes to show that not every famous person should open a restaurant. I guess it's worth a shot but I'm not giving it two. it's a shame that this restaurant will last too long just because someone famous put some money into it."}
{"text":"Honestly going with a large group of friends, we ordered and ate a lot of different pizzas. I am not going to say every Pizza was my favorite because who would believe me.. I can say however, Anthonys pizza is above the rest! Their meatball pizza is my favorite and their wings are truly the most amazing wings. I love wings, however theirs are like a dry rubbed type wings, with this amazing taste. 

Anthonys is in our top 3 pizza places to eat."}
{"text":"I am going to rate my experience as I dine....
Wait time for server to come 7 min...just to take drink orders
12 mins to get the drinks
36 min to get food

food quality and selection-----

quality....unfortunately whenever they get more than 3-5 tables in at the same time they try to knock out all of the pizzas right away which is making the quality horrible....our pizza was chewy not crispy as they said it would be, one half was cooked ok and the other half was undercooked....their sauce has chunks of tomato in it...it didn't taste bad but it could have been done better...

selection.....the selection is very small...you can get chicken wings but they don't have any types of sauces....so for those of you out there that like BBQ, buffalo or hot don't look to Anthonys to provide this. ....
 
now i was very suprised that this italian eatery DOESNT even have an Italian hoagie of some sort, instead they have a tuna fish sandwich....weird huh

Overall it is very loud and very crowded we will not be returning....bad service...bad food...go to milanos and save ur money"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite pizza Pittsburgh (like i have a wealth of comparison from the 13 months i've beeen here!).  Nice lunch spot but i recommend sitting at the bar if you want to have a private conversation.  Otherwise, the tables are close enough that you can be torn between the interview on your left, the sales lunch on your right and the secret office romance behind you.  In that case, i suggest the homemade sangria!

Typically people go there for the pizza and i dont blame them.  My personal favorite is the meatball and ricotta, although the tomato and basil is also good.  Order a lunch salad to round out the day."}
{"text":"Food & Service was outstanding.  Will stop back for wings.  Linda had the pizza and I had the tuna fish sandwich   I can't wait for leftover pizza tonight

{"text":"Seriously, $80 for two large pizzas, one salad, one solf drink and one glass of Merlot?  If the pizzas were fabulous I wouldn't complain, but they were just okay.  I've had way better (Piccolo Forno, Gateway Grill, Mineo's if you must know).  I will try this place again, we went within a couple of weeks of the grand opening, so maybe it will knock my socks off next time."}
{"text":"Pizza not bad, will probably return.  We received a sample of free wings, which were okay, but nothing great.  The pizza crust is borderline burnt (if not)- but like someone else said.... there's lots of signs saying that the pizza is well done.  If you haven't gone yet, give it a try."}
{"text":"Went today with intentions to have a beer with my husband and ended up ordering their wings... Let me say that they were AMAZING!  Not traditional at all but so delicious!!!! Can't wait to go back and try their pizza!! Oh and our beer was $1.50!!!!"}
{"text":"Both times I have been there the service was bad. Not really crazy about the food either. Price reflects the area....little pricey for a family"}
{"text":"I was driving thru and missed nyc cooking and we found this place with many star reviews.   My first thought was where is everyone as it was around 7pm and we peeked thru the side where there was a awning which only was used in warmer months.  The place was packed as we went thru the front door.   We ordered a regular salad, meatballs,  and a brick oven pizza.  It was plenty and it tasted very close to home.  The evening ended well but I lost my phone.  Someone found it in the parking lot and management was kind enough to take it to the hotel I stayed at the night before.  Thank you to the manager, staff, and the kind person who took it to Anthony's."}
{"text":"Stopped in one Wednesday night with my wife and two kids.  Great atmosphere.  Had a guy playing guitar and singing.  He was good and the music wasn't too loud or overbearing.  Beer was delicious and the pizza was great.  Service was great as well.  Nothing to complain about.  Now that we're moving to the area permanently, we will be back."}
{"text":"We had a lunch size pie with prosciutto and a meatball sandwich. Both were excellent. Service was very good as well. I enjoyed the craft beer selection."}
{"text":"went there on a wednesday night so it really wasn't that busy. Service was excellent and the food was good. I made the mistake of going to New York over the previous weekend but for Las Vegas pizza this is one of the best. A more diverse beer selection would be appreciated"}
{"text":"My wife and I noticed this place the last time we went to Settler's Ridge for a movie and agreed to check it out on our next date night, which was last night.

The atmosphere is ok, but nothing special. For a place whose specialty is coal-fired cuisine, I was hoping for something a little more homey.

Our waitress was friendly and checked in on us frequently. Also the place was pretty packed, and yet we got our food VERY fast. The service overall was definitely above average.

We got an order of the wings, which came with caramelized onions and focaccia bread. No sauce, no spices, just coal-fired chicken wings. Excellent! We hogged them down as fast as we could.

The pizza was good. I liked it a little more than my wife did, but even I was hoping for it to be better. We got half with baby meatballs and half with prosciutto. The crust was tasty, and the toppings were good. The cheese and seasonings, though, were a little on the bland side. Again, good, but not as good as I had hoped.

If you're at Settler's Ridge and looking for a place to relax and nosh before walking the 40-50 yards, or so, to catch a movie, Anthony's will do the trick. If you're looking for a kick-butt pie that'll make your eyes roll back into your head, go elsewhere. I absolutely recommend their wings, though."}
{"text":"A little competition for Grimaldi's .  Not the best location within Town Square but ok by me.

We started with  \"coal roasted\"  chicken wings with grilled onions and foccacia - unusual combination - i liked it, the gf didn't - \"too many burnt parts \"  i kinda like a nibble of  charred flesh .

Ask about beer selection, the server goes down the list - not impressed, order a corona.  Later i hear another server going down the list and i hear moretti and peroni - that pissed me off cuz i like the 'ol moretti bottle (beer is ok to ) - that old guy sippin' on a big 'ol mug of beer - that's gonna be me someday !

Anyways, gf gets a small specialty pizza - mozzarela, sliced tomato and basil - decent  but the tomatoes didn't wow me.  

I went with the basic sausage - for $14 i think they could've spared a few more sausage crumbs , but overall, not bad.  With a California pizza kitchen in the Square, Anthony's having a limited menu and Lord only knws what they are paying in rent !  I wish them the best"}
{"text":"The restaurant iatmosphere and service is very good.  As for their pizza, it's good but not great.  My pizza had burnt edges, which they said was normal for coal fired pizza, but it left this bitter taste that I did not care for.  Also, I ordered onions on my pizza, which came out caramelized.  Some people may like that, but the sweetened taste I felt didn't fit in with the rest of the pizza.  Overall, I might come here again out of convenience when I am at Town Square, but the other reviews are right on -- Grimaldi's is much better."}
{"text":"I love their pizza. It's my favorite! My galpal had a spicy bloody mary which she said to be the best she has had."}
{"text":"Perfect pizzas and good service. I highly recommend this place. Clean place and fast service. 
Meatballs pizza and 3 cheese pizza are the best."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!  Italian tuna sandwich?  Honesty, it had about three table spoons of tuna with TWO HUGE pieces of focaccia bread and a hint of vinegar!  THAT is not a tuna sandwich.  THAT is  focaccia bread with a hint of tuna!  Pizza was really good!  Fountain drinks we're $3.00!   Never again will I eat here for the money they charge and the conservative portions."}
{"text":"On our adventure home from the Pirates game we wanted to eat dinner but avoid the city rush so we ventured to Monroeville and well how can you go wrong with pizza?

We were seated very quickly and the hostess was super friendly. We showed up on the right day because there is live acoustic music on Wednesdays and the guy was great. 

Our waitress took our order fairly quick and the pizza came out super quick. We had a picky eater with our group so we just ordered the large pepperoni pizza which was good. Personally I'm not a fan of chunky sauces so I scraped the tomatoes off and on to my plate. I felt it lacked a lot of flavor and I needed to dip it in something ... Anything. It was inexpensive and worth the stop to avoid traffic. I would go back without my picky eater and try another pizza for sure this time without red sauce and the meatballs other customers got looked fantastic."}
{"text":"On my radar for a while..so excited to finally try!  I was surprised at the size walking in.. I expected the restaurant to be bigger - it wasn't but it didn't matter.  I liked the open-ness of the restaurant.  You can see the pizza being made.. the waitstaff working hard.. etc   The bar was medium size but we were able to find seats.  My friend recommended the wings - so we ordered those. .. I was assured that I would like them.. and I sure did!  Coal Oven Roasted .. they were delicious. I love chicken wings - but always with sauce but it wasn't needed.  They were seasoned but it was just right.   We ordered Pep pizza with extra cheese- very tasty.   It was a great visit..  thanks Anthony's Coal Fire Pizza !!"}
{"text":"Coal fired food super fresh no preservatives
Good wings if you like crispy pizza then this is the SPOT ! Its amazing. Great service  indoor and outdoor seating smaller yet nice bar area if you have never gone and in McMurray id say give it a try you really cant go wrong with anything on the menu"}
{"text":"So this was my second time here,first visit I met friends for late drinks. They had already ordered food so I had a piece of their pizza which was good at room temperature being that I got there a half hour after they got their meal. This time I went forget takeout, so it was time to personalize my pie! My toppings were pepperoni,sausage & long hot peppers!! Mmm mm mm, this has to be the first time I've had a pizza when the taste got better after every slice and no slice tasted the same. Now I don't know what that's a great description but it was amazing! Toppings taste fresh,crispy crust was perfection!! If your not a meat eater the hot peppers are a must! Going back for the wings real soon!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner and to my surprise the place is larger than I thought. 

We started off with wings, my friends really enjoyed it but I thought it was somewhat burnt and salty. For entree, we all shared the classic pizza with pepperoni and italian sausage, the crust was really tasty and the entire dish was great. 

Overall, great service and good food. Cant wait to go back to try their eggplants."}
{"text":"The pizza was \"ok\", but if you're a wing lover you have to try the coal fired wings! Oddly enough they don't have sauces for the wings though? But the wing itself is meaty, smoky and delicious. Served over some bread wedges and caramelized onions. Take out wings hold up very well."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch right after they opened  (around 11:45).  Staff was pretty friendly and the atmosphere was warm.  Our server was short with us even though im pretty sure we were the only ones in the section.  We ordered a pizza with sausage, meatballs, sweet peppers, and ricotta cheese.  The pizza was good, i expected to be wowed after reading some of the other good reviews.  We did feel a but rushed though, i didnt even finish my first piece of pizza by the time our server brought the check to our table. All in all it was good, and im glad i tried it to see what the fuss was about, but i don't think I'll be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I liked the Edison,NJ store. The meatball pizza here was bland, the wings were tough and the staff forgot to enter my order. I think $30 for these two items was a little expensive to boot. I would not recommend this pizza place."}
{"text":"First timers and we loved everything we got. The wings were piled with carmelized onions and served just out the the oven sizzling. My salad was fresh and very tasty and the pizza was a big hit with my husband. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been to both this location and the Monroeville location.  I haven't been dissatisfied with either.  Love me the roasted cauliflower pizza.  Soooo good and unique.  The crust is a tad thin on their pizzas, which a fair amount of my friends complain about.  I don't mind it though.  I think it goes with the various toppings they offer.  At the Settler's Ridge location, our server was spot on, and very attentive.  The craft beer selection was pretty decent too, which actually surprised me a bit.  There were at least 10 on tap.  Even though this isn't the top pizza joint in the Pittsburgh area (c'mon - that's too tall an order for a chain joint to fill), its a good place to stop for some unique topping choices, and oven fired pizza."}
{"text":"Hands down, Anthony's has the best pizza in Las Vegas.  I had a terrible server early one night, but have found a few regulars on the wait staff that are always helpful.  Every time, management comes around to make sure everything is going well.  Only negative I can say about Anthony's that makes it not get that 5th star is that there is nothing on tap; all beers and sodas are bottled.  For a soda drinker this is a good deal, but the pizza far outweighs any negative feelings I have."}
{"text":"Found this place on my way out of Vegas on a Tuesday afternoon.  Wanted a tasty but quick meal, and was quite satisfied here!  Quick and friendly service.  Started with an Anthony's Italian Lunch Salad, which in my opinion was big enough for two.  All ingredients tasted fresh and crisp, and were served with warm triangles of foccacia bread.  My BF and I shared a small pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni.  As they say, it's well-done...nice and crunchy, saucy and cheesy, and warm right out of the oven.  Definitely satisfied my pizza craving!  The only downside to the experience was that my BF had a mad craving for cheesecake and this place was out of it!  It's the only dessert they offer and they had none.  Aside from that, everything was yummy.  We wouldn't hesitate to go back there again next time we're in Vegas...but hopefully they'll have cheesecake!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in on our way to an expo.  We were greeted by the smells of cooking pizza crusts - yum!  The place was very busy at dinner time on a Friday. We sat at the bar and our server was quickly over to us and took our drink orders.  She took our order for the roasted cauliflower pizza with a big smile - supporting our choice. 
The atmosphere was cozy and not over decorated. We enjoyed our salads with a very good dressing. 
Our pizza came out quickly and we were overcome with the awesome smell of our pizza and we're delighted even more with the taste!  The small was enough for both of us plus leftovers!
I would highly recommend stopping in for a pizza and beer.  I know we'll be back next time we're near there!"}
{"text":"The smell alone lured my man and me up in here.  ahhh the smell of pizza.  We came on a Fri night around 6:30pm and the place was packed with people waiting outside in the dead of winter to get a table.  Now, I love me some good pizza but I'm not sure I'd stand outside waiting for a table in 9 degree weater.  We worked our way to the bar for a drink.  I ordered cabernet and he ordered a cocktail.  We knew this would warm us up.  We were told the table wait would be 35 minutes.  NOPE- they called us in about 10 minutes.  We ordered a large pizza with pepporoni, sweet peppers, and mushrooms.  The pizza was delicious, crisy edges with heat bubbles crispy and black from the coal oven.  So good!  The table next to us ordered a meatball and ricotta pizza.  I wanted to try some- next time, right?

Highly recommended!  It's not the typical burgh pizza - this place is special.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love pizza, so Anthony's is definitely one of my favorite places to go! My boyfriend come here often and recently we had a large pizza with mushrooms and sausage. Their sausage is so good! We've had the wings before, which are the perfect amount of crisp and flavor! They used to serve bottles of pop (or soda....), which we loved but have recently switched to fountain pop. Their drinks list looks awesome and I will have to try next time!"}
{"text":"Burnt crust . Everything was talented , except the crust. The service was very fast, and the bill was not as pricy as I would expect from such an upscale place. I will come back."}
{"text":"been wanting to try this place, to compare to grimaldis (my 2nd fav pie, behind settebello)
got there at 12:30 on a tuesday for lunch and it was pretty empty, only 3 tables in the place, so there was no vibe at all, just staff standing around!  service was attentive and quick. no fresh brew iced tea!!! WTF!!!!
we started with the baked chicken wings, and they were GREAT.  i wish there was some sauce with them but, they had great flavor from being roasted at high heat with lots of fresh herbs.
we got the paul & jon young pizza (???)  had meatballs, sausage and sweet peppers with ricotta cheese.  it was not good. the toppings were mediochre, and the crust was bad. tasted like something you can buy from the grocery freezer case and bake at home. very disappointed by that pizza.
i plan to go back, BUT  it will be for a salad and some more of those awesome chicken wings, sure as hell not the pizza!!!!
45 bucks for 2 for lunch, tip included (got the large pie should of gotten small or none at all!!)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it.  Fun atmosphere and friendly fun service.  Staff actually appeared to enjoy their job!
Try the baked wings, very tasty.  Pizza was excellent.  Very hot oven, thin and crispy crust.
If I lived here, I would be a regular."}
{"text":"I did take out for a large plain pizza, which came to a total of $30 dollars. The quality and the taste of the pizza are mediocre at best, with nothing to show for the extremely high price tag. The take out experience wasn't fantastic, with confusion as to whom was supposed to be checking me out. The staff was rather young and immature, not seeming to take anything seriously."}
{"text":"We order from here all the time.  I love the fact they do half and half pizzas so we both are Happy.  The broccoli rab is delicious.  The rosemary wings are to die for.  We even  used their catering before. They serve way to much for but it was delicious.  Several people who joined us that night now come here regularly."}
{"text":"I am kind of conflicted on this place.  We ordered a pizza with prosciutto.  We all liked it (the kids loved it, but they are not the pizza snob that I am).  The topping was applied with heft, but the prosciutto was cold.  When placed on the hot pizza, it became oddly warmish, not a good thing.  As mentioned by other reviewers, the pop and iced tea is served out of the bottle, and costs an arm and a leg. They have a full bar. How can they not have fountain drinks?  Bottles take up so much room and create so much waste. I guess had I wanted more to drink I would've been hit up with another drink charge.  On the plus side, the service was friendly and very quick.  As we were dining with a toddler and a preschooler- quick delivery of food to the table is a huge plus.  This is also good for them, because it helps turn tables quicker.
Overall it was okay, but I won't go out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"In town for a convention this week and my co-workers and I stopped in for dinner. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for Mothers Day lunch.  Our waitress was very good even though they were very busy. Food was predictively good.  The Dairy Queen going that will occupy the end of the same building will make this a very busy parking lot. The drive thru que for DQ will line up in front of the Anthony's outside eating area."}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff, good sight lines, warm deck and decent food. Can't wait to sit outside this spring."}
{"text":"Excellent Lunch portions just right, wings are different tasteing not for me need more seasoning they are coal fired too would be better if they gave some ranch dressing with them.  Overall the service is excellent Our waiter really nice and knowledgeable.  The pizza looked too coal fired but was excellent and moist a pleasant taste compared to the traditional pizza establishments."}
{"text":"Simply amazing.  The staff were friendly and attentive, and the food was absolutely delicious.  My kids will never let me take them anywhere else again.  We'll definitely be looking into their (surprisingly affordable) catering service as well.  Favorites include their wings, the broccoli rabe pizza, and calzones in any configuration."}
{"text":"Pros
Quality ingredients. Cheese and sauce on pizza were good.  Salad ingredients were crisp and very fresh and tasty. 
Wings are a stand out. 
Service was good, not the best. Young servers who seemed like genuinely nice people. 
Good draft beer selection.

Cons 
Expensive for pizza. 
A small one topping was 15.99. Not that big. My self and my 4.5 yo ate it all and we're both hungry. Keep in mind I normally eat a max of 3 pieces and I'm stuffed of a heartier pizza.  
Dough was neutral. A papery taste 
Salad was expensive for a side salad too. $6 and change. Plus $2.99 for added cheese. 
Server said it was good for 2 people but it's just a regular size salad

Overall
I would come back for sure. But not in my regular rotation. Once a year or so.  
Pizza was a thinner crust. Not thinnest but not normal pizza thickness. I prefer a heartier pizza."}
{"text":"Totally underwhelming, on every front. 

My fiance and I had been wanting to try this place for a while. We live quite close, and drive past every time we go to a movie or to the grocery store. So tonight we finally had a chance to stop in and get some pizza. 

The first thing I noticed is the attempt at an \"upscale atmosphere\" pizza joint. I kind of hated it. A nice looking bar, tarnished by a bunch of pizza joint style table seating (four tops mostly, and one long booth that has chairs on the opposite side). Nice decor on the walls, nice music, silverware and quality condiment shakers on the table... But the plastic plates and bottled soda is the opposite of everything this pizza place is trying to be. 

I personally thought the menu lacked variety. There are only a few selections of \"specialty\" pizza, and I wasn't really wowed by any of them. Nothing really stood out to me. Sure, you can customize a pizza... at $3/topping on your $18 pizza. 

First we ordered the wings. I didn't like them at all. They tasted like any old chicken wings baked in the oven with black pepper, rosemary, and the faintest hint of garlic. Kind of bland, except when I got a little spring of rosemary in a bite, and then it would be overpowering. 

We ended up ordering one pie with half mushroom and pepperoni (can't screw that up), the other half with tomato, mushroom and onion. It was okay. I'd give it a 5/10. The crust was...okay. Nice and crisp, but nothing special. The sauce was barely there, and tasteless. The mushroom and pepperoni were the best part, but isn't that typical of just about any pizza? The tomato and mushroom were fresh, which was great. I absolutely HATE places that use jar/canned mushrooms. So, kudos on that at least. The onions were supposed to be caramelized. They weren't... they were just sauteed, in olive oil I think. Most people probably don't notice the difference though. 

We also ordered a white pizza, which we added tomato to. Thankfully we did, because, again, it was pretty bland. No garlic, and I had a difficult time tasting the ricotta. It was dry. Again, nothing special. The tomato added a little more moisture and flavor. 

For the cost, its totally not worth it. We spent over $60 (not including tip)... and for that you get plastic plates and soda served in a plastic bottle. No thanks, I'll stick with the neighborhood pizza places, or the Hop House."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Anthony's Eggplant Marino pizza for lunch so we took the whole crew for dinner last night.

The staff was very friendly.  We ordered a traditional pie and a broccoli rabe and sausage.  I was thrilled that the broccoli rabe and sausage showed up not as blackened as I've had before but it ended up being really soggy with watery liquid dripping off the pan onto the table.  

In the past I've enjoyed the coal fired crispy thin style without excessive cheese but in this case, there was an over abundance of tasteless cheese.  It wasn't fresh mozzarella and it lacked saltiness for being something else. The crushed tomatoes were almost non existent so it lacked acidity and still managed to be floppy and soggy.

The most disappointing part was that the 6.00 difference in price between the traditional and the broccoli/sausage pie yielded about 10 tiny dots of sausage on the whole pie.  One piece had no sausage at all and most of the others had only one or two small pieces.  

It's really ridiculous considering that adding two toppings (say broccoli rabe and sausage?) to a traditional pie should cost 4.98 but since broccoli rabe and sausage is considered specialty, they raise the price by 6.00.   

The staff and management should make a traditional and a specialty and look at them side by side then ask themselves if they'd pay another 6.00 for what they're getting on the specialty.  If not, they shouldn't ask their customers to.

We love a good coal fired pizza so I hope this place isn't taking a nose dive after initial success."}
{"text":"So the pizza was OK. 
The wings were pretty good. 
The service was outstanding!!!

Maybe I just like a little more spice, but I found their best seller - Paul & Young Ron - to be a little bland, even with hot peppers. 

What made this visit for me was the bartenders. Ingrid and Lexi were great!!! Friendly, very helpful and extremely knowledgable. Some bartenders know beer, there two really like it and it shines through. I'll be back because of them! Thanks girls!"}
{"text":"$28 for a pizza and salad, still leaving hungry. The pizza was very good though just seems a bit over priced for what they're selling."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped on our anniversary for lunch/dinner and we were so happy with everything!  We started with wings and man they were good but also not the same as a traditional wing. They were not sauced but rather naked wings with onions and a side of foccia bread. Also an order of meatballs and to say they were awesome was an understatement words could not describe how good they were...they were a fine ground up meat with almost a creaminess to it...in a tomato sauce that was orgasmic...it also came with some fresh ricotta cheese and a sprig of basil and also some foccia bread...next time I'm just going to get a pot of meatballs because they are the bomb...then the main course the coal fired pizza it was so good with a fresh tomato sauce and fresh cheese...only knock on the pizza was that the crust needed dipping sauce to dip your crust into or sauce put to the full edge because it was dry once you got to the edge...over all this place was an excellent place to have dinner at and I recommend going to Anthony's it is worth the money!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza.  However, this place really needs to decide what direction it is going in.  Elegant dining or Pizza Hut?   Decor is very nice. Plates and cups are tacky plastic.  Drinks are by the bottle only...not fountain.  $2.75 per drink.  guest pour our own drinks. Waitstaff was friendly enough but not very attentive.  Prices are very high. No happy hour.  For the price point (over $15 per pizza) I expect A+ service, real plates/napkins/cups etc, drink refills.   The pizza is excellent.  Sadly, the while package just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"I'll give a rating of OK.  I have been there twice.  The first time I didn't like it at all.  The pizza was too burnt.  All their pizza ends up a little burnt, but this one was overly burnt.  The wings were also flavorless and terrible.

The second time I went was for someones birthday.  I kind of went kicking and screaming, but this time the pizza was a lot better, but still not as good as you can get a lot of other places, and it's quite expensive compared to other pizza places.  It's not really terrible pizza, but for the big bucks they charge, go somewhere with better pizza.  

So all that being said, would I go there by choice?  No.  Would I be ok going back if I had to, yeah."}
{"text":"Ambiance: upscale pub; fire pit outside with ample seating, cozy inside with a nice little bar and kitschy decor.

Pizza: Delicious and crispy, but does not reheat well. The Eggplant  and white pizzas are my favorite, but all the toppings are good quality and delicious. I also really like the wings - they are plain, breaded wings without sauce or anything fancy, just deliciously prepared with sauteed onions. Numerous craft beers on draft. A very good place!"}
{"text":"I was struggling between a 3 & 4 star. It was ok. Nothing happened to make it bad or great. I guess I would go again if I happened to be in the area."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, but I don't really get the burnt crust thing. Whatever... I mean, there was nothing bad or wrong with the pizza, but it was kind of bland. We got the arugula and added hot peppers. The sauce was uneven and tasteless. Peppers were super hot. Just not great."}
{"text":"Ate here the other night for the first time and will not be the last. The pizza was awesome! It was not burnt; It's a coal fired oven! if you know anything about coal fired ovens, you'd now the difference. The service was great. The crust was thin but hearty and the Eggplant Marino was the best I've ever had. The eggplant was sliced so thin and tender. The menu is short, but the pizza was fabulous!"}
{"text":"I loooooove Anthony's. When I go to the movies in this area, Anthony's is my top choice for dinner. Their service and kitchen are both FAST, and the pizzas that I get here are always high quality. It's an intimate little place, and you can watch dinner being made in their oven pizzas if you get a good spot.

Anthony's also plays to their strengths very well, in that they offer a focused menu that's based around a handful of key ingredients that can be made into pizza, sandwiches and so forth; I admittedly always get their pizza. A focused menu means that while its list of options is smaller than some places, the ingredients are generally as fresh as possible, and it enhances the quality of dinner all around.

Mostly recently during my visits I've sampled their meatball and ricotta pizza, as well as their eggplant pizza. Let me tell you, that eggplant pizza is the best I've ever stumbled on. I've found many bad eggplant dishes out there, so the fact that they managed to perfectly cook theirs and layer it on top of fresh dough and sauce and cheese...I was impressed. Kudos to the cooks. Giant glasses of sangria always complete my meals here - they're the (sometimes literal) cherry on top of a fresh and flavorful night out. 

I'm very excited to come here again in the future, especially after the menu switches up again, as there are a lot of flavor combinations being mentioned in other reviews that they don't have at the moment. But in the meantime, I know those meatballs and those eggplant dishes won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"I really appreciate Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza. After all, the pizza is simply good. The crust is thin and perfect and the bites are elegantly simple. Some of the specialty pizzas are conceived somewhat strangely. For instance, the arugula pizza just comes with arugula piled on top and dusted with some parmesan, so it's really an arugala salad atop a piece of excellent cheese pizza. While this might be peculiar, it certainly doesn't invoke a complaint. The wings are roasted and they are very good, although not necessarily what one might expect."}
{"text":"Ate here Mother's Day evening. Hostess was rude, very short, and just not nice. The wings were a little dry. However, the bartender was wonderful! Warm, approachable, and friendly."}
{"text":"Just went to Anthony's. Overall I thought the pizza was good. I liked the sauce on the plain cheese pizza. It was sweet and a little zesty. I get the idea of a oven fired pizza and everything, but the crust on the pizza (my favorite part) was burnt.  The Philly cheese steak pizza was also very good. The place was packed - not sure if it was because it was a Friday during Lent or what, but we waited for 45 minutes. A little weird - when I asked for a Coke it was given to me in a plastic bottle...do they not have a fountain machine like every other restaurant?  The server was very nice and personable. He highly recommend the wings. It was a little loud for me. The prices were fair - actually less than I thought they might be."}
{"text":"Amazing is the best way to describe this place! The wings and the pizza are simply awesome! The wings are like nothing I've ever had before. They are definitely worth the try! The salad was awesome too!"}
{"text":"Parents took me here while I was home for Labor Day. We walked right in on a Saturday evening, no wait. Place is nice and open inside, especially on a nice day with the patio open. 

We got a large pizza with mushrooms and sweet peppers and an order of their wings. I was intrigued by the wings because there isn't a vast list of flavors like other wing joints--just their blend. I was a bit skeptical when my dad told me they come covered in sautéed onions, but wow were they good. Seasoned perfectly with their special blend of spices and the onion flavor seeped in. Tasted like a chicken wing should, not trying too hard to mask the actual taste. I wish I had taken a picture so you could see the onion pile, which we ate on the pita bread that came with It (my dad also added some to his pizza when it came.)

The pizza was also quite good. I loved the mushrooms because they were cooked differently than the normal soggy type that shows up on pizza. My only complaint, and I know it's coal oven pizza, is that the edge of our pizza crust was very burnt. The bottom wasn't, but the edge of about half was extremely blackened. I think it needed spun more in the oven while cooking to even it out. But I'd still definitely return, it was even good cold for breakfast leftovers the next day!"}
{"text":"Maybe I am not a pizza person.  Had a couple of friends highly recommend this place.  Tried once, ok but nothing stood out."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. Calzone was more than \"well done\" burnt is better word. Asked for hot sausage added... hmmm, if it was there we didn't find it other than the $1.99 added to the bill.
The crust was so dry on top and burnt on bottom. Sauce was good.
Don't think we will go back."}
{"text":"Warm, welcoming, and wonderful staff - What more can you ask for?! The food at Anthony's, was amazing and very fairly priced. Though I have only been once, I could see many interesting dishes being served around me, with many very satisfied customers. Check them out if you have the opportunity!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place! I love eating here because it's delicious and a great place in general. Love it and definitely recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for a long time and unfortunately was very disappointed. I love love love pizza super excited to try it. For the price the pizza was salty and I did not care for their burnt style crust. Also found the food to be over priced. Very small menu which can be beneficial but not this time. Our server was very nice however will not be returning due to the food. Harry's pizza 1 minute down the road is still superior."}
{"text":"Pizza was great I'm glad we ate here instead of California Pizza Kitchen. Price is reasonable. Service was excellent! It's right next to valet and the movie theatre."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I stopped here for a quick bite to eat on a weekday before catching a movie. I had been wanting to try this place for a while, so we finally did!

First off, the hostesses were very unprofessional, laughing and goofing off in front of customers. When we walked in, they were gossiping with one another and I had interrupt them to get seated, even though they clearly saw us come in. 

We had a nice table off to the side, and got a nice view of the restaurant. The space itself is kind of weird, like one big square room. Not the best ambiance. Boy, was it loud in there! The music was blasting and it was hard for us to hear one another. It was late and I understand it was in the midst of changing from a family restaurant to a bar scene, but still the loudness was a little too much for us. 

Our server, Nathan, was extremely friendly. He was attentive, quick, and always there when we needed him. Best service I have received in a long time! 

Tom ordered a craft beer and I got a Diet Coke. They bring the soft drinks out in bottles, which I'm sure saves them money, but I think is rude. No free refills allowed... so I drank very slowly. We ordered a white pizza and split it. The pizza was pretty good with very fresh ingredients, but not good enough for the price. Also, their pizza is \"well done\" in a coal fired oven, which means that the crust is crispy, burnt, and there is black coal dust all over the bottom of the pizza. Not completely appetizing if you ask me... I will stick to brick ovens and wood-fired!

Overall, decent pizza for too much money. Service made up for it. Go for lunch when it's not so loud."}
{"text":"I do not understand why this place is packed most of the time.  The pizza is too greasy for my liking.  Overall, it is average at best.  I do like a couple of things and that is why I will round up to 3 stars.  The pepperoni is crispy and very tasty.  At times, I like the crust due to the coal oven."}
{"text":"Hmm.  Where to start.  Well, I thought that it was A-OK.  

Anthony's was a new experience for me, in that it's basically like a sandwich shop that has converted all of its sandwiches to pizzas.  I tried the Philly Cheese Steak and the Mini-Meatball pizzas.  Both were delivered quickly, and the name reflected the taste.  A small is big enough to satisfy a hungry fella, and they'll let you do half & half on the specialty pizzas to boot."}
{"text":"Anthony's is pretty good! I've been here a handful of times for a quick meal and have tried a few different pizzas. Their service is quick and I love the unique pizzas that they have! There seems to always be a wait on the weekends here too, so make sure to give yourself time if you are extra hungry! 

All of their pizzas are coal fired which gives them a unique flavor different from typical pizza places. I prefer the brick oven more (a la Il Pizzialo) but it's always nice to switch up your pizza! I have tried a few different pizzas here including the white pizza, roasted cauliflower pizza, and the meatballs and ricotta pizza. All of the pizzas that I tried were great and different from pizza I have ordered at other restaurants. They also have coal fired wings that everybody raves about- I'm always too full to have any! The prices are alittle high at Anthony's but it's a great place for a meal while in Settler's Ridge."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in for pizza and wings twice. Both times were excellent. The thin crust pizza is excellent, even more importantly great sauce and toppings! The oven baked wings are yummy, you should try them, not a vast selection of menu items but the items available are superb!"}
{"text":"I tried the mozzarella, tomato and basil pizza. The crust was crispy and the ingredients were fresh. The cheese was really food and gooey. Sauceless pizza are not my favorite but this was tasty."}
{"text":"Service was great, pizza not so much. Overpriced, $18.00 for small 2 topping pie that was dry and tasted like a cinder.  Nice selection of beers but at stadium prices. $9.00 for a 12oz. pour of a local craft brew that can be had elsewhere for $6.00 for a full pint."}
{"text":"We had to go to Robinson and decided to stop here for a quick dinner on the way home - I've been before so I knew what to expect and it was a solid meal.

Got the wings which were pretty good - maybe needed a touch more seasoning but I do love the caramelized onions and focaccia they're served with - ordered 5 and it was more than enough for the 2 of us.  Also got a small classic Italian salad - enough to share with cool, crisp lettuce - could've eased up a little on the dressing but tasty.  Our small square margarita pizza was also good too.  Love the fresh basil.  Nice size - enough to feel full and pack some away for a lunch tomorrow.

Overall this was a solid meal - our server was great.  One thing I appreciate was they had bottles of wine available at a very reasonable price.  So, I'm not dying to come here again but I won't complain if we do"}
{"text":"Qualifier:  I'm rating it a 5 because I'm comparing to standard take-out that has artisan offerings such a Pizza Parma.  I haven't yet had an opportunity to taste other more upscale artisan pizza establishments here in the South Hills, so here we are.

Wow! This is not a traditional pizza place!  Forget your classic take out and take-n-bake! 

First of all, they don't have sauce on their pizza per se.  It's more of a dressing and comes in about 5 different types.  Second, they don't coat their pizza with cheese.  You have large slices or spoonful's of high quality cheese randomly covering the pizza - more of a European style.  The crust is thin and crispy the way I like it and a little unevenly charred from the coal oven (which is also the way I like fired pizzas).  Third, their ingredients are fresh, whole and better quality then the places that advertise on quality.  Not a huge selection, but what they do have is very high quality and quite unusual from what you would expect for pizza. (such as marinated cauliflower, whole banana peppers, prosciutto, whole pitted calamata olives)

The artisan pizza environment has become generic, so this restaurant is an updated and pleasant twist to the genre. 

My kids (9 and 11) had a sausage, prosciutto, calamata olive, pepperoni pizza with a basil-olive oil sauce.  Yummy!  My husband had the specialty meatball pizza with 1/2 hot and 1/2 mild peppers.  Both savory and spicy!  Warning:  because they use the whole banana pepper, even the mild is spicier than you expect because the internal seed area capsaicin is intact.  While I can eat raw Jalapeno's from my years in AZ, the spicy banana peppers killed me.  Different heat trigger I suppose.  

I had the sour ribs.  OMG the sauce is a soup and it is incredible.  Again, both savory with the rosemary and spicier than expected with quite a bit of vinegar.  Very tender.  I'm glad I ordered the 1/2 size because they had a lot of meat and spices were intense; I had to eat them slowly.  I will have to have them again though!  This entrée would also make a fabulous appetizer or munchies dish to be shared.  Also the kind of dish you remember and then crave at odd moments for no identifiable reason - unless you're pregnant.  This dish would have fit my pregnancy craving profile perfectly!

Bar:  great selection of craft bears, nice standard beers, including my husband's Peroni on draft.  I'm not a liquor drinker except for the occasional margarita, but if I remember correctly, it looked well stocked.  

Service was incredibly friendly.  It's obvious the  staff takes pride in their restaurant and is friendlier than the normal curt, dour Pitts wait staff personality type.  Attentive, fast bar service to the table, good timing on extra napkins, lots of smiles and eagerness to explain things.  Well done!

Décor:  normal 2010's decade mid-scale.  Clean."}
{"text":"Very fast seating, very nice Waiter and the food came out fast... Pizza was excellent as well as the wings... Wife and daughter loved it. Their specialty pizzas are awesome! Great food and Atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came into Anthony's one day last week.. Our waitress's name was Britany. She was a very sweet young lady. We got our usual pizza there, Fresh Mozzerella and Tomato Basil. It was OUTSTANDING! It always is! We also got their classic Italian salad. Very crunchy lettuce and the dressing just makes your taste buds dance! 8) We will be stopping back soon and will request our same waitress!"}
{"text":"Nice interior atmosphere for the restaurant although the men's  bathroom was a little on the trashy side. Starter salad was very tasty. Cauliflower pizza was a little bland although the regular pizza was top notch. Service was fast and very friendly. Over all a good experience and we would definitely come back."}
{"text":"So I'll say this...I really like pizza.  I like pizza about every way that it can be made.  But one thing I don't care for is chain pizza establishments.  Don't get me wrong, I won't turn it down.  But I much more prefer independently owned and operated.  However, in the case of Anthony's, this is about as good as a chain gets.  

We have been here about five times, and have had quality food on a consistent basis.  When you first walk into the restaurant there is typically a hostess directly inside that opens the door and greets you.  Nice touch.  I've never had to wait for a table, but it has always been fairly busy.  

Start off with the wings.  If you've never had the wings before ask the server and they will give you a sampling of two.  The wings are wood fired and have a rosemary dry seasoning on them, then topped with caramelized onions.  FANTASTIC!  

As far as pizza, I have tried the margherita, the paul and young ron, and your basic peperoni.  I loved them all.  They give you balsamic and olive oil, and I suggest dipping your crust in either.  YUM!  The crust is always just slightly blackened on the edges, which I love.  The margherita has no sauce with mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil.  The paul and ron young has peppers, meatballs, sausage, and ricotta. 

The service has always been friendly and accommodating.  

They seem to have some good beer, although I've never drank there.  The soft drinks and tea comes bottled.  So no free refills.  But who cares, its a quality product.  

The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the food came out kinda quick.  I wanted just a little more time to eat my wings.  And this happens because the oven cooks the food quick.  So this is just a timing problem.  All and all, good food, nice people, a bit pricey, but the product is worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is a review where the stars are based solely on the service. I've been here several times in the past, and though I'm a NYC pizza kind of guy, something about the burnt thin crust, sauce and toppings really appeal to me. I took an out of town guest here Wednesday night. We were seated almost immediately.

We ordered a large pizza with mushrooms and sausage, a small order of meatballs and ricotta, and a couple of iced teas. I still don't get the \"only bottled soft drinks here\" thing. Why no fountain drinks - you have beer taps? C'mon.

Anyway, there was a couple with a small child seated on the other side of the restaurant from us and the little Beelzabub had a scream somewhere between Jamie Lee Curtis and nails on chalkboard. And it was near constant. The parents just talked and laughed, and would give the kids things to play with, which she would immediately deposit on the floor. I didn't want to complain to them or the wait staff, but you'd think they would say something to the couple. Or that the couple would, heaven forbid, parent. But it went on for a bit, disturbing everyone in the restaurant. Such is life I guess - finally they left of their own accord. I'm all for family friendly, but doesn't a Tazmanian Devil fall under the category of pets?

First our meatballs arrived, and they were delicious, with a small dollop of ricotta and sauce. Then our pizza came, with the same delicious burnt crust, good quality crumbled sausage and fresh mushrooms. Can not complain about the food, though it seems many here have. To those who complain about the pizza being well done - CAN YOU NOT READ THE SIGNS POSTED EVERYWHERE IN THE RESTAURANT?

It was then that I noticed that the restaurant seating area was totally devoid of wait staff. They were all congregated behind the service counter in two small groups, giggling away and in discussion. This wouldn't normally bother me (though it might have bothered the other diners who were waiting for service), but our waitress was doubling as the bartender AND was in her own intense conversation with a guy at the end of the bar. She had placed the check on our table about 5 minutes before, and I immediately put down my credit card. She was much too absorbed in conversation to notice much of anything. After about another 10 minutes I gave my check and credit card to another wait person who happened to finally walk by (and who was none to happy that I violated protocol), and she took it immediately to our waitress/bartender. Finally! But of course her conversation with bar anchor wasn't finished, and we had to wait at least ANOTHER 5 minutes until I finally got the receipt to sign.

So, to sum it all up, food top notch, service EXTREMELY spotty."}
{"text":"To continue my pizza- centric weekend....

My family and I went to Anthony's right when they opened on Sunday at 11:30.  (And we were not the first ones there and also not the only ones waiting in the parking lot).  We were seated promptly and our waitress was right there getting our drink order.  there were 5 adult and a high chair which is easily accommodated int he dining room.  One large pizza, a small pizza and a family style shared salad was the perfect amount of food (even with some eaters at our table).  

Let me tell you about the pizza.  I am a crust person and a ratio of sauce to cheese person.  Crust was crunchy on the holding end and a perfect mix of doughiness and crunch throughout.  the sauce to cheese ration was a a tad more sauce to cheese, just my personal preference.  The red sauce is not bitter, but sweet as it is a perfect compliment to the pepperoni.  

I cannot believe I haven't been there before.  I am looking forward to see if there is a night crown.  The bar is pretty snazzy."}
{"text":"Visited today, very nice young woman up front, took my 'to go' order......all the employees up front were very nice........I got my order FAST and she asked  if I needed help carrying stuff......she was very nice.......our pizzas were great, the WINGS are really great- ovenbaked, not fried.......they are marinated and I requested no onions and they respected my request......they were AWESOME......best in the city, including places known just for wings.......also got the meatballs and ricotta.......EXCELLENT meatballs and sauce........just grrrrreat !!!!!!!!! LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!! Very nice employees!"}
{"text":"Family style ambiance would be the key selling point to this place. If you have a large group, want to be seated quickly and enjoy a couple pizzas group style it's a great place. Nothing is bad, just nothing is great. The pizza is pretty good, the \"famous\" wings are good, the salad is a great portion and also decent. The service is okay. The prices are okay. Nothing here really fits a \"best of\" category. It is also strangely diy lit creating a strange ambience as nothing else puts off a similar romantic vibe. All pizzas are thinly cooked so if that's an issue move on. Also, although our waiter claimed it would only serve 3-4 people, the salad can easily serve six. Essentially, id caution on being sold on this place just for the \"coal fired\" pitch, great for seating the whole family but there are better places to feed them"}
{"text":"I can't give a better review of this place... It is a must if you enjoy Pizza baked near a fire. If you don't go, it's your loss. Service is excellent, too."}
{"text":"In a word: amazing! Very reasonably priced. Had Family sized salad and a large pie. Enjoyed by all on their lovely patio!"}
{"text":"This is certainly a nice place to hang out and eat.  People are friendly and food is good.  Service is on top of things and fast.  The pizza looks amazing, but I had the tuna salad sandwich, which I can say it was among the best I ever had! Best thing, tuna salad is not prepared with mayo but with olive oil! All in all, I am definitely going back to this place with the first chance! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The wings are highly recomended as is the pizza. The beers could be bigger for the $ and the kitchen got our order mixed up so it took a little longer. Overall though the food and server were great!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with a party of four. Had a white pizza (incredible) a meatball and ricotta pizza (quite good) a house salad (delightful) and 10 wings (meh)

The white pizza was spot on. No complaints. Go and get one now. The meatball and ricotta pizza was a little soggy, but all the flavors hung together very well. The sauce wasn't overwhelming and the meatballs were seasoned perfectly. The salad was great. Very basic with a lovely dressing and fresh mozzarella on the side. The wings were dry and a bit flavorless. The sautéed onions were interesting, but didn't add much to the whole shebang. 

The interior was nice. It was full but everyone was relaxed and quiet, with the notable exception of the staff. At all times there were a large group of staff cluttered around the kitchen shouting at each other and just hanging around. I only saw two or three of them ever going out to check on tables and the rest just mulled around aimlessly. It's a shame because it marred an otherwise lovely dinner. 

Also, they don't know the difference between sweet tea and tea with lemon. Fun!

Come for the incredible pizza, but get it to go, unless you like the sound of shouting teenagers in which case, I can't help you."}
{"text":"The service was good but the seats are really close together and it is really loud. I really enjoyed the pizza but the wings seemed a little undercooked compared to the first time I had them."}
{"text":"We got there at 5:50 pm on a Saturday night-place was full.  We were told it would be a 25 minute wait, it was a half hour.  We were able to grab some space at the bar so the wait wasn't bad.  It also gave us an opportunity to check out the different dishes coming from the kitchen on the way to the waiting patrons.  We had two pizzas, wings and ribs between two couples, the food was delicious:) although a bit pricey.  The atmosphere was loud, crowded and filled with delicious smells, yet we were able to talk amongst ourselves and be heard without difficulty.  All in all a good time."}
{"text":"Great service and food!! Was a busy night for the Resturant however they kept up with the orders and the food. 
There were 7 of us! Meatballs / wings and pizza were to die for! Thank you and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Pizza and wings are great, but SO pricy. I have a hard time paying 20.00 for a cheese/ eggplant pizza. I feel like their prices have increased since the opening here in the Monroeville location. Also skip the Sangria...not great. My glass was like a a beer glass full of red wine with apple chunks floating in it. Gross. 

Worth the trip if you have never been, but be prepared to pay as this is not going to be a decently priced pizza experience."}
{"text":"First time visit for lunch -  Three of us stopped in for lunch yesterday.  The service was very good. We ordered pizza (of course) and wings. The pizza was tasty and well prepared but nothing \"out of this world\". The wings were a nice surprise and well plated. As mentioned in prior reviews, the acoustics lend to a noisy environment. It was loud once the lunch crowd showed up but not unbearable."}
{"text":"I like the wings. The pizza is okay. Some of the slices had only maybe half of it covered with the toppings! Crust burnt. My friends went again and they burnt the wings and pizza even more!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Love the atmosphere. My favorite on the menu is the cauliflower pizza.  My hubby's favorite it's the wings, they have caramelized onions in them delicious"}
{"text":"Honestly, not very impressed with this place. The younger blonde at the front is unfriendly and doesn't seem to want to do any work. The other younger girl seems pretty clueless. The older lady is friendly and doing most of the work. Their menu lacks. Our waitress was pretty clueless and unhelpful. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"We had the meatball appetizer which was good, but not heated the whole way through & cold in the middle. Wait staff was not very attentive. No refills. Once I asked for sugar for my iced tea, I eventually had to get up to get it myself. 
Eggplant pizza had way too much sauce and was kind of flavorless. The margarita pizza was also, not nearly as good as it looked on the menu & did not have fresh mozzarella on it as advertised. The crust was good, but could've used some salt.  I was satisfied, but I will think twice about returning as my experience was not outstanding. It's very pricey for what you get and not worth the money spent."}
{"text":"First off, i have been to many anthonys across south Florida and this place was definitely on par. The only thing different was that they didn't char the crust like normal coal fired pizza,  probably because of the pictures other reviewers have posted as \"burnt\" (its not). We ordered a side of foccacia and a caprese salad,  both of which came out promptly. We ordered a large traditional pizza with an extra side of marinara.  Our server brought two with extra basil. All the food was good, the cheese was very high quality,  and service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Food is so great! Love it! Been there three times, everybody love it there! The chicken wings is a must have."}
{"text":"The key word here is well done pizza.. That's what they mean the bottom is not really Brent but is is well done with the darkness and a crisp.. My family and I go here often and I think I have had mostly a lot of whats on the menu and I gotta say haven't found anything that I don't like... From pizza with cauliflower and spinach to ribs with jalapeños to wings that are seasoned to perfection to slices of provolone cheese with tomatoes and herbs atop.. I like it all is all different... 

I had been talking to the manager after a beer and food tasting/dinner, and we talked about the different meals combinations of foods. He had stated that all the recipes had come from a long line of ancestors.. Food is not only differently good but it is excellent. As long as you get past the well done part."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, once for pizza... it was descent but I wasn't blown away by anything.
Second time I tried an italian roast beef sandwich, it didn't have a lot of flavor and was a little dry.
It was ok."}
{"text":"We have. been wanting to stop here for some time but many of the reviews made us shy. 
The meatball pizza was very good. 
I'm not sure what most of the complaints were about, we we pleased on all fronts. 
The wings are meaty and a totally different texture. 
They are a bit pricey but not enough to keep me from returning."}
{"text":"O.V.E.R.P.R.I.C.E.D & Overrated!! 

Went here the day after they opened with quite a few expectations but was very disappointed. To start with we ordered ice tea - which turned out to be store-bought packaged ice tea for which we was charged twice the retail cost. The Italian Salad we ordered was run-of-the-mill (was 9 bucks and extra 3 for an ounce of store bought shredded cheese). Decided to share the 12\" Meatball and Ricotta pizza. It was average, and nothing to justify the 16 dollar price tag.  There was hardly any ricotta, and the meatballs themselves were bland.  There are other places in and around Pittsburgh where I've had much better pizzas (Dinette, Piccolo Forno to name a couple).  Save your money and either dine out at those locations, or make your own pizza at home.  Just leave it in the oven for a bit longer to achieve the same 'well done' effect ;) 

Stay away!!"}
{"text":"The pizza at Anthony's is very good, but I don't think there are enough options. There is also not a soda fountain, so you can't get refills. You need soda with pizza, this is America- we live in pizza and soda. However, the staff is always nice and I do love their eggplant pizza."}
{"text":"Four stars because of the price. Yes the food is phenomenal. Yes they have a great selection of drinks. No the price is not right. They have a very simple menu, pizza and wings with salads.  The wings are to die for, and the pizza is made to order. Don't get me wrong I understand you get what you pay for but this is a little over the top. Parking is a little sparse, it is in a shopping center shared with many businesses so plan ahead. Also call before you go, this is not a huge place so they do go on waits very often.  Good experience."}
{"text":"Very good service.  Nice atmosphere. Place is a little pricey, but quality is there and they take a military discount. I believe there is only one flavor of wings, but it's savory and delicious. Tell them to hold the onions if you don't like them, they pile them high over the wings, which I did not mind. They were some of the best wings I've ever had. Pizza was okay, would like to try something other than pepperoni next time. Will return and do recommend."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas around. Went for lunch and saw the place was really busy. I guess to be expected for a new restaurant. I understand this is co-owned by Dan Marino and is a chain that hails from Fla. I don't know of another one around Pittsburgh.
I tried the plain cheese pizza this time but would branch out in future visits. The pizza comes from a coal fired oven and therefor comes out a little charred around the edges and a bit on the bottom crust. But not to worry the taste is outstanding. 
Lots of other foods here like salads, sandwiches, wings and ribs. There is a bar so they serve a decent selection of beer also.

I will definitely be going back to try additional varieties of their pizzas."}
{"text":"This really does need a 1-10 scale, because four stars doesn't seem to do this justice, but I grade a little harder with pizza, so I can't quite do five stars.  The service was exactly what it should be, contrary to a couple recent reviews I read, prompt, courteous and unobtrusive.  
I usually get suspicious that loads of toppings mean that the pizza joint is hiding poor craftsmanship.  This is not the case.  Everything is done right and they actually have the right to claim that their toppings are of high quality.  
A couple reviews gave seemingly pretty harsh dings for things I would also like to address.  One was about the peppers being inconsistently hot.  I have grown many kinds peppers and for whatever reason, you occasionally get really hot ones and some just aren't.  Be happy they didn't come from some greenhouse that manufactures their plants instead of growing them.  The other is the way the pizza crust got soggy.  I make pizza at home as a hobby and love to visit places that approach pizza as a craft.  Properly made pizza does not age as well as that half eaten Dominoes you leave sitting on your counter overnight for breakfast the next day.  Knowing that, take that soggy slice and shove it in your mouth.  It still tastes great."}
{"text":"The service was not really great. I asked if we could have a minute to look at the menu. 30 minutes later we had to ask for our server. The pizza is OK, really nothing special. The boys liked the wings. The are not your traditional wings with sauce. The have grilled onion with them. As a whole it was ok."}
{"text":"Good is excellent watch out for the bartender w glasses she has an attitude and is unfriendly.  Salad dressing is excellent.  Haven't had a pizza I didn't like"}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was pretty good. The crust was super thin and I don't know a lot of places around here that do it like that. It was also a little burnt and I see that mentioned in a few other reviews so hopefully they will work that out soon. There are definitely way better take out pizza places in Robinson, but if you are at Settler's Ridge looking for a fancy looking place to eat pizza, this will do the trick."}
{"text":"I was quite pleased with our lunch here.  The waiter was very nice and very quick even with a full house.  We were in and out in 45 minutes with a family of 5.  The food was good and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"We had a very nice unplanned lunch at Anthony's today. In my system 3 stars is the maximum score for a casual pizza place, since it's a very low level of difficulty establishment. That said, we were happy with our shared salad and meatball sandwich. The sandwich was made from a pizza crust, with sliced meatballs and a very spicy pepper - nice! It's an open, clean, loud dining room. The menu is limited to pizza and a couple of salads and sandwiches. There's also a surprisingly diversified by-the-glass wine list. Service was prompt and professional. Anthony's is definitely on our lunch list."}
{"text":"I LOVE thin crust pizza with a crunch and Anthony's delivers that! If you love meatballs try the ricotta and meatball pie.  My hubby and I also always share the family size Italian salad.  It's always perfectly dressed and a great way to start the meal.  The only drawback is the seating set-up.  It's all open tables and they are very close together. It can get very load and you always end up hearing everyone else's conversations but have a difficult time hearing the people at your table."}
{"text":"Loved it!
A little pricey for pizza and the specialty selection is small but the pizzas are delicious and i love the super thin and crispy pizza crust. It is baked hotter than most pizzas so the thin crust does come slightly charred. The hot peppers on the pizza are whole peppers and were very hot.
The wings are also very good.
The cheesecake is probably the best plain cheesecake I've ever had, I would definitely get it."}
{"text":"Really good food. Parents had the pepperoni bacon pizza and I had a chicken sandwich. Best chicken sandwich I ever had. We also had quality service. Our waiter went the extra mile and served our pizza slices and put them in a box for us after. We are from AZ and that's not a normal thing. The beer and wine was also excellent. First meal in Pennsylvania and off to a good start!"}
{"text":"Have gone to this place several times.  Every time we have friends come in out of town, we always bring them here.  The pizza is great, but their wings are AWESOME!  If you've never been, it is worth a try."}
{"text":"I love their pizza!!! I've eaten here tons of times and have tried many of their different pizzas as welll as different starters and it's all great! My favorites for the pizza are the pepperoni, margarita, and the cauliflower. The wings are so good! I love the caramelized onions they put on top as well as the rosemary and bread. The meatballs are yummy and the salads are fresh and huge with lots of ingredients! Service has always bee good! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Coal Fired Bomb!

Today was our first visit to Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza. I was very interested in coal fired pizza do to the way it is cooked. I have never had coal fired pizza so today was my first. The thing on cola fired pizza's is they are cooked quick...like real quick. The coal fires the oven to temps around 1200 degrees. I LOVE crispy pizza, and coal fired is crispy pizza!

Most pizza joints around have bad habits of under cooking there pizzas, ACFP does not! The crispy crust and all around pizza is perfect. Gateway Grill better look out, this is a very good pizza! The Grill held the best pizza in Monroeville honors in my book, second is of course Napoli's. But ACFP might be climbing the charts. I can't rank it in the top after one visit, but there is the potential for some good things.

We went with the \"Paul & Young Ron\" Pizza. Meatballs, Hot \"whole\" marinated peppers, Hot Sausage, and Ricotta Cheese. the meatballs aren't nothing to right home about, BUT, there is something about them that I think really works well on there pizza. I love the crust, kinda a sour dough taste. NICE N CRISPY, the way the jedi likes.

So after the first visit, it ranks a 4 on the yelper. i feel more good things to come from the place.

A bit pricey, but where isn't. Comparable to the Grill & Naps.

*JEDI APPROVED*"}
{"text":"Not the best, probably won't go back and I go to town square all the time.  I do agree with the burnt crust comments, I have had coal fired pizza that was crispy but they didn't have to burn it to get it.  I don't really remember more about it because it really wasn't memorable.  Try Ciao Ciao, Grimaldi's, or settabello instead."}
{"text":"The pizza at Anthony's is some of the best around. The wings are delicious and they have a good selection of beer. The food is a little pricy but worth it. The beer prices however are absolutely OUTRAGEOUS. $6 or more for a small 16-20 oz beer is probably the most expensive in the area. I can go pretty much anywhere else and get a tall draft for $5-6 for the same type of beer. Soda also comes in small bottles, not out of the fountain like most restaurants, causing you to pay $2 per soda every time you need a refill.  I personally like to have a few drinks with dinner and simply cannot afford to pay $60-70 with food and drink very often. If it wasn't for the drink costs I would come more often."}
{"text":"Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza !!!  LOVE THE WINGS  I am not a wing person don't care for them in other restaurants, but I just love the coal fired wings at Anthony's. The caramelized onions and focaccia bread make these wings to die for !!  

The pizza and sandwiches are good. I like the meatball sandwich. The meatballs themselves are fantastic. We have ordered the 13 meatball kettle many times as take-out for dinner. I love the kettle they come in, and have several of them, a few I have given to my daughters as extract cooking pots. I wasn't crazy about the roast beef, but don't let that discourage you. The thin crust pizza with the burnt crust is very good, just not my favorite, but that of many of my family members, so it is a given, we order  pizza and WINGS, with take home meatballs. 

I like the friendly atmosphere and the polite servers and especial the Manager Steve ! Ask for Steve, he is a sweetheart from start to finish !  

We have been to several other locations of Anthony's, for a chain restaurant it is very well managed and the food quality and service are very consistent. Great restaurant!!"}
{"text":"So after our first choice for dinner ended up being closed and being a bit questionable about our 2nd choice of a dicey sushi place in a strip mall, we ended up at Anthony's.  Place is decent inside. Looks like a few steps above a sports bar.  We were seated immediatley and our server took our drink orders. Beers on tap were pretty limited. Is the large selection of draught beers a WI/IL thing?  Anyhoo, our waiter asked if we wanted to try their \"coal fired\" wings. I'm not a big wing fan so I declined but he was persistant and offered to bring a free sampler of the wings out. We said sure.  The wings were okay. They weren't saucy but had a good spice to them and the coal fired cooking process gave them a smokey taste you don't usually get with wings. Not bad but not enough to make me order a full round.

I opted for the pepperoni pizza. I had never had coal fired pizza before but I knew it gets a bit more \"crispy\" on the crust edges. And sure enough, mine definitely had blackend, crispy edges. It was just okay. Nothing bad but nothing that would make me seek out coal fired pizzas after that. I still think Donatos has the best pizza in the OH/PA area."}
{"text":"I was so surprised at how delicious this place was. Yes, it was busy and took a little longer than I would like. But, it was worth the wait. The meatballs were so tasty and the house made ricotta nearly made me lose my mind. I will be visiting frequently."}
{"text":"Menu changed, service changed. Manager today was a rude son of a bitch."}
{"text":"We had the eggplant dish and the cauliflower-garlic pizza.  both tasted great.  the place setting is cramped.  the soft drinks on offer (coke products) come only as 20oz. bottles and they are pricey, i don't like this type of policy.  service was good, and even though the place was packed we did not have to wait long to get our order.

The pizza comes a bit charred, this is how coal-fired pizza is prepared.  The wait staff and the writing on the wall informs you of how all their pizza is 'well done'.

They have an ad, beer and pizza specials on some weekdays.  I'd like to come back for that."}
{"text":"Great pizza, wings, & beer selection. All topped of by Fresh Fired foods.  Ate at their DelRay location, and ever since I've been hook."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, not phenominal, but good. The wings however blew me away. Our server brought us a free sample of them and I was amazed. I will be coming back to make a meal of them soon.

Service was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere pleasant. We sat on the patio because it was a beautiful day, but because the patio is right next to the main road in to the plaza, there was a lot of traffic noise. 

Drinks are the downfall though and the reason I couldn't rate 5-stars. All of the soft drinks (including iced tea) are Coke products in bottles at $2.99 each. No one at our table bought from the bar so I can't comment on that. 

Overall, a pleasant experience with good food and amazing wings."}
{"text":"Middle of the road for me - perhaps a 3.5  I'd go back and probably enjoy it, but it wouldn't be a go-to pick. 

We came on a Friday night and were seated right away - yay for that!   Our server came by quickly to take a drink order, but then took a pretty long time to come back with it.   We ordered the Paulie's pie (half sweet and half hot pepper's) and the rib appetizer.  The ribs were really good - tender and flavorful - fall off the bone.  

The pizza was a mixed bag.  I really enjoyed my sweet pepper half, except for the crust, which was much too charred (black and crumbly)for my taste.  Bummer, cause I like to eat the crust.  The boyfriend suffered though.  The server should have issued a warning on those hot peppers because my orders-spice-level-8/10-at-a-Thai-place boyfriend thought they were too spicy to eat.   He picked them off the last slice, but by then, the damage was done.  

Which brings me back to the overall service.   Our server was very friendly, but clearly a little frazzled.  The first round of drinks was slow, so we ordered round 2 when he dropped them.  The ribs were served without plates, silver, or napkins (the manager rectified that).   Round 2 of drinks also took forever, but he did pick it up with Round 3.  About halfway through, we did notice that he had a big family with a ton of kids in the adjoining room that was very high-maintenance and monopolizing his time.  I kind of felt back for him after that.  The pizza was dropped by a runner, who didn't tell us how to distinguish between the sweet and hot side.  Fortunately, we guessed right, as those hot peppers would have ruined my day.  

At the end of the day, it's a chain and it feels like a chain.   I can give then a pass on the service since I saw the reason that happened and I saw the manager trying to help out.   But the blackened crust isn't my favorite and I was longing for a few more appetizer choices."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, but I think the Robinson store puts out a better product. The manager should have closed the porch, the place was not very busy and is freezing inside. I am sure the other customers here today were cold. The server was very nice, I want to see businesses survive so they need to pay attention to all aspects."}
{"text":"Atmosphere:

The restaurant is an open space with hard surfaces.   The hard surface net effect makes the place loud.
I was with an older woman (mid-70's) who had a very hard time hearing the conversation.    

Food:
My party was observing lent.    We ordered the Egg Plant appetizer, Sweet Pepper Pizza, and the Cheese Calzone.
Each had decent flavor but nothing to take it to the next level of other wood or coal fire pizzerias I have visited.      Please note that the pizza are \"well done\" which I prefer (crust must pass the stand test - ie. No floppy slices).    The oils from the cheese still made my pizza soggy.

Service:
Our service was great.   The waitress was very attentive and kept our refreshments filled.

Price:
Pretty Expensive - You are not at ... Pick your Chain here... 

Overall - I really don't think I will go out of my way to visit this place but if it is convenient or other folks want to go then I will give it another try."}
{"text":"Talk about a great pizza place. I went here a few weeks ago and was extremely happy with the food, service and environment. I ordered a large pie with pep, a salad, some wings, and a tuna sandwich. If you don't like your food a little charred then this isn't the place for you but I love my food like that. The wings where like none other that i have had before, the pizza was thin and crispy, salad was very flavorful and the tuna sandwich was delicious. A+ to this establishment"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite weekday lunch or dinner spots.

The pizzas are pretty good, and I love the meatball plate as an entrée when not in the mood for pizza.  Their wings, however, are GREAT.  Full of flavor, and they come with focaccia bread and caramelized onions.  Can't beat that.

They also always have a good selection of beer on tap.  Both local and adventurous brews!"}
{"text":"Great pizza horrible service. Anthony's like any chain is hit or miss, unfortunately this one is a miss."}
{"text":"Today I went to pick up a take out!  I walked in and  I was greeted with a super sweet young server. Ashley, a manager took my order over the phone. I pay, I  question my order because it seemed kind of high. The server repeated the order which was completely wrong. It was a pizza when I ordered a salad. The server quickly went into the kitchen to get my salad started. She then went  over to Ashley and told her the issue. The MANAGER ASHLEY then quickly got rude and loud basically calling me a liar saying I ordered a pizza. I know what i ordered. (because what I ordered today is what they forgot in my order last week and I've been having a taste for it since last week.) She then (with a nasty attitude) tells the server to reorder the item. The girl came back me and assured me its not my fault. At this point I am uncomfortable and angry. Ask the server to make sure my card is not charged twice (which there are currently 2 transactions pending on my card holding  funds)The manager Ashley again yells at server \"I told you to reorder it!\" The server explains she swiped my card for first transaction. Ashley says it was never charged. Again very rude! to both me and the  server. A manager, to talk to employees like this in front of guests is beyond wrong and very bad for business. Her attitude and demeanor were out of control. This young server was mortified by the way Ashley spoke with me and her!!!!"}
{"text":"Got a HUGE craving for the Eggplant Marino this weekend and was excited to scarf down some of the coal-fired wings.  Imagine my complete disappointment to find that they've closed.  Just like that.  Sad panda is sad. :(

Rated 4 stars but now, what does it matter?"}
{"text":"So I love the bar. However I had a visa gift card from Christmas that I could not use. Not cool"}
{"text":"The pizza is very very good I will say.  However, I do not like how limited your options are.  You can't get any salad dressing other than their Italian.  There are only 4 pizzas or so to pick from.  They don't have ranch dressing which I think is crazy for a pizza place in the Pittsburgh area.  I would only go back if I was getting pickup.

Our server, Max was awesome.  I'd actually consider eating inside again, despite my issues with the place, because of how funny and nice he was."}
{"text":"We like both the wings and pizza here. Tasty and most often quick service. As a twosome we like to sit at the bar. Quite awhile ago they moved the draft beer list from behind the bar (logical),to a wall that's behind people sitting at the bar and a good 18' away. Every time we sit there people ask for a beer list. They need to put one at the bar. They only have about 10 to 12 beers on draft. They only change them occasionally. Print a list and have it available at the bar. Not sure about the wait staff at the tables but the bar tenders are poor at best.These girls probably mean well but interact more with each other than the customer. They are not very attentive and always seem to have some kind of drama going on. Anthony's really needs to invest in one good experienced bartender. They can't all be immature newbies. We often think, it will be better next time. But, it isn't. Unfortunate because the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings with some hard to beat beer specials.  there pizza is a close as you can get to a pie in italy that I have come across in the burgh.  wings are also done in the coal oven and covered in caramelized onions.  great job guys!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Sunday night. It's a small restaurant in Town Square. The place wasn't busy at all so it took no time to get seated. Our waitress was very friendly and almost too attentive (stopping by every 5 minutes almost). Their menu is pretty limited and they specialize in coal fired pizza (who would have guessed). There are signs all over the restaurant that will let you know that your pizza will be \"well done\" -- meaning the bottom may look a little black and burnt but the top will be perfect.  And, that's exactly how it came out. The crust was thin and crunchy and the top was a little too greasy but that was from all the pepperoni. It tasted really good and the salad we had was also good -- nothing spectacular but still solid. The pizzas are more traditional than what you would find at places like CPK or Sammy's (\"gourmet\" pies) so it was a nice change of pace to get something old school like that without having to go to a crappy pizza place like pizza hut or domino's. There is no kid's menu, but that didn't really matter since we all shared one pizza. I was disappointed with the beers they had (didn't feel like drinking corona or heinekin) but their wine was surprisingly good (got the malbec). This place is definitely worth a visit and we'll probably be back."}
{"text":"Love the wings!!!! Candied grilled onions are layered on top.  Highly recommend!!! 
Not deep fried but baked in their oven!!"}
{"text":"We went to Anthony's for the first time. We sat at the bar and the service was great. I did not care for my Italian roast beef sandwich, and my partners calzone was a blob of melted cheese stuffed in a big piece of baked bread. Everything tasted bland. I was disappointed with the very limited menu."}
{"text":"Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza... I've been to this place several times and am so torn.  Every time I've been here I love the food, but hate the price.  With that said, they have a unique product so I understand it being a little expensive but in my mind their prices are a little too high.  

I will say that the wings are unique and so good that I come back again and again, in spite of the price.  The Cheesesteak Pizza is melt in your mouth good.  I've had several of the other pizzas and really liked them as well.  The toppings seem fairly high quality in general.  As for the people who have complained about dark crust.... Read the walls, that is sort of their thing!  If you order the right things the food is unique and tasty enough that I have to give this place 5 start in spite of the price.  I would absolutely bring people from out of town here.  I'll just warn you to be prepared to shell out some cash depending on what you order."}
{"text":"The pizza & wings here are burned. The bottom of the pizza was black. The wings were also black. We asked our waiter why everything tasted burned. He said because of the coal oven. The wings tasted like eating an ashtray. Yuck! There are so many great pizza places around. I find no reason to go here again. One & done."}
{"text":"I have only been to the one in Settlers Ridge.  I have been there twice and can't say enough good about it.  The pizza, the salad, and the meatballs are great!  Short wait, good music, nice bar."}
{"text":"Obvious this restaurant is not familiar with GOOD GREAT coal fire pizza.
This had to be one of the worst pizza, if that's what you want to call it, I have had.
It was a pita bread texture with minimal about of tomatoes.  I mean minimal.
Cheese harden quickly and I didn't see one piece of basil.
Being 100% Italian I had to share my thoughts about this terrible experience.
 On a positive note, the salad was good."}
{"text":"11-21-2014.  This was my first time dining here and expected much better.  Being 100% Italian and eaten this type of pizza all over the US and Italy, I have to say this was not up to Coal Oven Brick Pizza standards.
The crust was chewy and semi raw, the sauce was thick and over powered with garlic and salt and had a bitter taste to it.  Sauce should be on the sweeter side.  Dough should be crispy not soggy. 
My pizza certainly did not look like the pizza displayed on the website.
As for the chicken wings, besides being over salted they were wonderful and the way I prepare them. Rosemary is always wonderful to use when chicken is roasted as such. .
I sat at the bar service was terrific ."}
{"text":"Wings wings wings!  Who would think wings at a pizza joint!  It's a must try!!  And it's not battered and fried and topped with grilled onions!!!!   And the pizza was great too!  Sure, it's not true East Coast pizza.... but it was still good pizza!  The service was outstanding too... our waitress was so attentive.  The atmosphere was casual.  We were seated immediately!   The menu was simple, no frills, but it was just perfect.  You can get one of the specialty pizzas, or  make your own.  We did both!!!  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Very good selection of beer with rotating taps.
All coal fired, so the pizza and or anything else is crispy.
Salads are great especially with extra olives and cheese.
Good for a weekday dinner on the way home from work, and if you don't want to order in they have curbside."}
{"text":"We started with the wings.  They came out with no sauce and covered in onions. I thought they would be bland and tasteless.  I was wrong on that one. They were the best wings I have ever eaten. 

We then moved to the family style salad. It was very good.  The dressing was very good. Often Italian dressing have too much vinegar. Not this one. 

We then moved to the pizza. The Philli Cheese Steak pizza tasted like a nasty cross between BBQ and Machacado, which is a spiced Mexican beef jerky that is used to make Machaca.  If I owned this place, I would remove this pizza from the menu. 

The Paulo's pie was ok except for the large lumps of ricotta that were on it. I would not order that again. 

I also tried the arugula pizza, which sounds weird, but was surprisingly good. I would never have guessed that. 

I have to give this place 3 stars.  The wings and salad were 5 star worthy. The Philli Cheese Streak pizza was worth zero stars while Pauli's pie was worth 1 Star. I would eat the wings here again."}
{"text":"Popped in Saturday afternoon. Sat outside because it was a little cold indoors.

Great choices on the wine list. Ordered a bottle along with broccoli rabe and sausage pizza. Enjoyed the sample wings that were brought to our table. 

Pizza arrived very quickly. Good. Not as thin and crispy as I was expecting from the \"well done\" signs all around.

A bit windy outside. Pizza was not very hot when it arrived; cooled quickly. 

Servers are very friendly and energetic. 

I'm a bit iffy on another pizza. Salads and some of the beers seemed interesting. I would go again to try something other than a pizza, but reviewers were not wild about the salads it appears. 

My first choice for pizza is still Bella Luna.

Not a bad experience. Not really as expensive as everyone claims. 
I'll have to give it another shot."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite pizza place. My top picks are Philly Cheese Steak and Meatball and Ricotta... Yummm!!!

It probably is little pricier than others but you get quality and unique options.

They also have the best wings in Pittsburgh. Marinated in olive oil, herbs and oven roasted.

Last but not least great salad/dressing, their homemade red wine vinaigrette is to die for."}
{"text":"Nice pub like atmosphere. Prompt a courteous service. Good thin crust pizza with choice of toppings and some other Italian dishes."}
{"text":"After 5 years I have acknowledged that the inconsistent quality food is not worth it. Once among the best, I am giving up."}
{"text":"This is a must whenever I'm in the Robinson/Settler's Ridge area.

We usually get a pepperoni pizza, salad, & cheesecake. Can't complain about any of it. 

The pizza is usually well done (think charred crunchy crust), sauce has a great flavor. Prices are fair and service has always been great. 

If you're looking for something different than the standard take out/delivery places then check out Anthony's!"}
{"text":"I went here 2 months ago for a birthday dinner. When we were seated at our table, I immediately spotted a fly inside the Parmesan cheese container! However, our waitress replaced it quickly. When the pizza came out it was burned on the bottom."}
{"text":"Update: I stopped in and recently had the white pizza and a calzone with mushrooms in it. Everything was less salty and the crust was actually quite good. Either they improved or I it was just because I ordered something different this time. Bumped it up a star.


I have not been very happy the two times I have been here. Something feels really off both times. I feel like I should love it! Coal fired pizza that you can see being made. A nice, smaller menu so I know they care about the dishes they are preparing. But the food just isn't all that. I ordered a cauliflower pizza the first time I went and it was so salty I really felt like I would die later than night. 

Yesterday, I shared a sort of plain pizza and an eggplant marino pizza. They weren't bad, but they weren't good either. It almost seems hard to explain but something was just off tasting. Like no real substance. Absolutely way too much sauce. The cheese was a little tasteless. The eggplant was fried so it was oily. They put giant sprigs of basil on top but none of that taste throughout. It was just ehhh. And the atmosphere shared the same. It couldn't decide if it was a sports bar or a trendy coal fired pizza restaurant. It just didn't satisfy me. Plus absolutely no appetizers..at all!"}
{"text":"Top notch pizza, folks. The service is always fantastic, and everything (from the salad to the wings) is amazing. Love it."}
{"text":"Alright.... So I arrived at 3:10 with my family yesterday. We ordered our pizza by 3:15 and didn't get it until 4:00! The manager claimed that he told the firt person in my party that every day, they turn off and clean the coal ovens from 3:00- 4:00 We disputed that claim. During our 45 minute wait, we endured LOUD music....horrible music! I swear to god I had to endure every Bill Joel song featuring a saxophone solo. While we unknowingly were waiting for the ovens to fire back up, the waitress tried to push more beer and appetizers. Also, this is one of those places where the idle waitstaff outnumber the customers 2-to-1. I was headed out of town and going to the airport, so the excessive wait stressed me out. We took our pizza to go.. Oh yeah, the pizza...I almost forgot about that because it was so completely forgetable. First of all.....the coal-fired thing is ridiculous. Why? Are we trying to support the economy in West Virginia or is there a culinary rationale to this? My eggplant pizza was so bland. There are these things called spices, Columbus went searching for them. Look into it. The pizza was also ridiculously overpriced. I can name dozens of places in the eastern burbs that make better pizzas for much less. They only get 2 stars because they refunded part of our check to make up for their utter incompetence. Don't quit your day job, Mr. Marino...oh wait....nevermind."}
{"text":"The only down fall about this place is that it's SO expensive. 2 pizzas and an order of wings was about 50 bucks. That's wayyyy too much for pizza and wings but I can honestly say it was delicious and well worth my hard earned money ;-)"}
{"text":"This review will be short and sweet, as I'm writing it from my tablet 

We started off with 5 wings and 4 meatballs (we were curious about them).
The wings were tasty, but they weren't whole wings, just fyi. 
The rosemary foccacia bread and sautéed onions that the wings were served with were my favorite part of the app, lol.

The meatballs were also pretty good, very tender and good flavor. 

My husband and I each ordered our own small pizza; I had the white pizza, which I really enjoyed, and he created his own. 

We enjoyed our meal, but our total was $70. For that price, we both could have had filet mignon, an appetizer, and a couple of drinks, elsewhere. 

It was really good, and we really enjoyed everything, but at the end of the day, we had pizza and wings for 2-3x what it should have cost, lol."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my family.  Both times we've never left disappointed.  They cook the pizza exactly how we like it.....Well Done.  If you don't like well done pizza, then you shouldn't come here.

Our favorite dishes are the Paul & Young Ron Pizza (Meatballs, Sausage, Hot Pepper, and Ricotta Cheese)....we also like to make our own.  For an appetizer we split the Fresh Mozzarella & Tomato Salad....which comes with marinated sweet peppers...we add a little oil/vinegar and it makes for a nice appetizer.

Service - We've never had any issues with service in the 2 times we've visited the place.  Service was always prompt and courteous.

Will we return?  Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza, great service, nice atmosphere.  I love their pizza, wings, and meatballs.  The sausage and brocolli rabe pizza is phenominal!  The pizza does get some char from the coal oven which I feel adds to the flavor.  I am sure this is not for everyone but I love it.  Better than Gateway grills pizza BY FAR!"}
{"text":"nice alternative to the pizza typically served in the immediate area - pleasant atmosphere and wait staff"}
{"text":"I routinely patronize the original store in Fort Lauderdale and was very happy to see that I could get Anthony's Coal Fired when I am traveling.  The location for this particular part of the chain was really good to get them into a market where people might snub their noses up at a new kind of pizza. With the Cinemark Robinson movie theater a 2 minute walk through the parking lot and ample parking, this Anthony's is continually packed. 

Having been to the original, I figured I would be better writing a review that compares and contrasts the locations based on my order:

Pepperoni Pizza
Meatballs smaller with less ricotta
Chicken Wings

The meatballs with ricotta was first to arrive. The meatballs and portion of ricotta served were smaller. The meatballs tasted slightly different. I couldn't quite tell if it was because there was more filler in the meatballs or if due to the fact that they weren't cooked as much. The ricotta didn't have the same rich and full flavor that I am used to getting at Anthony's.

The chicken wings were the next items to arrive. The only real difference with the wings is that they are not cooked as much. I really do enjoy the charring on the wings and onions and do wish that these were cooked more.

The pizza, while still well-done, was not cooked as much at this location as the other location. My biggest issue with the pizza at the other location was the extent of the burnt crust. At this Anthony's, there is a tad more grace to the cooking in the coal-fired oven. There were really dark brown marks along the crust in places, but no where was the pizza actually burnt. The sauce still had that wonderful peppery tang to it.

Overall, I think the two locations are on an even keel and that they can learn from each other to make the food better. This location can take lessons from the Fort Lauderdale location in the preparation of its appetizers. The Fort Lauderdale location can definitely take some lessons on how to make a coal-fired pizza well done without burning it."}
{"text":"I wish yelp had a rating out of 10, I would give this place 7/7.2 out of 10. 

It is a classier pizza joint with craft beers, they used coal fired ovens and the venue is very new and clean. 
 
As expected a large pizza is 20 dollars and they have interesting specialty pizza combinations! We got the tomato and basil pizza which tasted quite delicious.

The server was very nice, pretty tentative,and her recommendation was definitely a good go to."}
{"text":"Mediocre food with a good selection of beer.   Service was decent, however they don't know how to handle a crowd over 6.  Pizza is horrendous.    Cheese wasn't cooked properly, undercooked, and the crust was black on the outside.   Wings are decent, salad decent, meatballs were probably the best thing they have going for them and they probably bring them in frozen."}
{"text":"I'm excited (and slightly ashamed) to say my husband and I come here about once per week. More than likely we sit at the bar. We are the ones chatting it up with the bartender drinking a beer. Their beer selection is hit or miss, so sometimes I'm happy when they have one I like, and other times I'm sad because they don't. 

The pizza is very well done.  But I really like it. Sometimes it tears up the roof of my mouth though... Haven't figured out why.

Bartenders Ingrid and Ricky are great though. They are very attentive and nice. 

Side note: bring your own hot sauce or ranch dressing If you like that stuff... I get sad when I forget it."}
{"text":"Awesome Wings - check.

Amazing coal fired pizza - double check.

Great Service - check.

Needless to say, we love Anthony's! This is our go to when we decide to eat out last minute and have a craving for something filling and familiar. We love the wings, and regardless of the serving sizes, we always each get our own pizza, because who doesn't love left overs?? 

Everytime we've been here we've had a great time, with the exception of the last time. I didn't let it effect my rating or my review, because I know it's not typical, but I still think it's important to mention. We were sitting at a high top table right across from the kitchen area, with servers constantly rushing by and in perfect ear shot of all of their conversations, which I don't normally care about, with the exception of this time. There was one male server who was obviously flustered and irritated, and when he saw he had been given another table, this was his response- \"G*d d*mn it, do I not deserve a f*cking break, J*sus Chr*st!\" ........... not cool, dude, not cool.  Fortunately he was not our server, or we would have been out the door at that moment. Our server was good (seemingly new, but good), and otherwise we had a good time, but that was a pretty shocking experience. I get that you're tired, but maybe just don't be an immature idiot next time, and be aware of your surroundings. 

ANYYYWAYYY!  That aside, we love eating and drinking here and will continue frequenting! Hopefully that one server doesn't get too many tables again, after all, we wouldn't want him to make too much money off of those pesky paying customers that are such an inconvenience!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is really nothing close to your normal pizza shop. Nicely dressed staff, open coal fire oven for all to see. The place really looks good. A little crowded during dinner time but great overall décor. The service was nothing short of outstanding. I sat at the bar as I normally do. I was sitting down for about 2 minutes as I listened to the bartender explain their entire menu to the couple sitting next to me, she made everything sound so good the couple ended up ordering a bar full of food (no room left for me).  I was reading the wall full of drawings and craft beer selections (carefully drawn and neat) and the bartender introduced herself as Kally and asked if I'd been there before. I told her I had not been there and she assured me I have been missing out. She explained the way their pizza was cooked and help me choose a beer she thought I'd enjoy. It's this kind of customer interaction that really keeps customers coming back.  I ordered the Salad and Roast Beef Sandwich as recommended by Kally ( I LOVED IT).  The food overall was very good. I stopped back in a couple days later and  it looked as though the whole staff was different. I sat at the bar and wasn't spoke to for over 10 minutes which at that point I left.   I didn't see Kally working it seems as though she is the only one with some customer service.  I would like to go back and try some of those amazing looking wings.

{"text":"Ordered the cheesesteak pizza. Not the best pizza in the world but not the worst. Very thin crunchy crust that was burnt on some pieces. Their house salad is pretty good."}
{"text":"Coal fired pizza? Sounds pretty awesome to try and a new experience for those Italian or non-Italian food lovers who reside in the Pittsburgh area.

Pros: Awesome setting and wall decor like iconic framed photos of Marilyn Monroe to Frank Sinatra and Pittsburgh Pirates memorabilia, the food isn't just warm BUT hot enough that the cheese will automatically melt once you start to consume the pizza, friendly service and accommodating, great outdoor dining/patio with warm torch-like poles surrounding the area, and lots of television screens for those sport fanatics to admire while devouring!

Cons: As a first time diner- the service was similar to a turtle as in I didn't get any service until 30 min later even though it wasn't a busy day or so it seems, the menu listing was much smaller and not much of a variety compared to the alcohol list which isn't very pleasing, the pizza and other meals are supposedly all cooked with a coal fired oven thus my pizza was burnt throughout the crust and the dough was a bit too thin for my liking (how is it considered a pie? my bet is as good as yours), the seating arrangement is too cluster phobic for me especially being seated next to a family with children (GR!), there are no such things as condiments such as ranch sauce since I ordered the Rosemary dry rub chicken wings and it's simply too dry for water to even help digest it down.

I don't mean to be such a tough critic, maybe as my first dine-in experience wasn't too lovely but I definitely wouldn't mind trying it again! I have tried takeout from this restaurant and it wasn't too shabby since the food was still pretty hot by the time I received it BUT as I have mentioned before, my dine-in experience could've been better. It's a great place for those seeking a different variation of an Italian classic pizza and quite a venue for watching sports or dining outside at 10 at night."}
{"text":"Go Pats! Drove into town from RI to watch the Pats play the Steelers and stayed right outside of Settlers Ridge.  My dad and I got in late on the saturday and were looking for something easy and quick.  Coming form a place known for good pizza I had sort of a bias.  I'm also not one for chains, but I was thoroughly impressed with this place.  The service was great and they even greeted us by opening the door as we walked in.  We were seating right away and served very quickly.  My dad and I decided to split the Philly Cheesesteak Pizza and we were both extremely satifisied.  The carmalizeed onions made the pizza have that much more flavor and it filled us up just right.  I ordered two drinks along side my meal and my father orded one.  I was very impressed with the taste of the pizza and it was at a reasonable prices as well.  Although a smaller menu, I will be back to one of these locations when I am looking for a great coal fired pizza at a great price."}
{"text":"We always order the following at Anthony's:

Paul and Young Ron's Pizza with both hot and sweet long peppers 
(A second choice would be the arugula pizza)
The oven roasted wings heaped with loads of caramelized onions. Yum!
A pitcher of Sangria. 

Neighborhood gem. Awesome !"}
{"text":"We had a feast for two people and everything was absolutely delicious. Our server Max, was attentive and very honest about how good everything is. We got the cauliflower pizza and the Philly cheesesteak and they were incredible. I don't know what else to say besides that everything about this place was amazing!"}
{"text":"I sometimes think I am a bit of a Pizza snob as the idea of a chain pizza makes me want to eat a hamburger instead. This place definitely is not a run of the mill chain.
The restaurant is small in size but does have a small area to wait which helps. The bar is about as big as can be expected and has a pretty decent variety of beers to choose from. 
Service: Fast! Finally someone who gets it. People are there for Pizza so the sooner the server gets to the table, gets the drink order and while procuring the drink order they can also explain their style of pizza and what might work best for the table or group. Our server was all of that. He explained that the pizza will be cooked very well through when compared to a typical pizza and will be thin. How many slices the typical person eats and didn't PUSH the salad. Our pizza arrived very quickly, nice, hot and charred just a bit. Love it. Everything was great about our pizza. We ordered a large and a small but could have done well with 2 smalls. (I think it was large, they only have 2 sizes if I remember correctly.) Yes, this place costs more. Don't bother with a salad. the salads are overpriced and if you are there to eat pizza, EAT pizza. Salad and Pizza? Really? the soft drinks are served in plastic bottles. quick to serve and no beverage system to invest into and maintain. I've gone back several times, Always great and they are quick to turnover tables. Lots of TV's. Not a bad thing. if you are looking for some intimate place to have pizza this isn't it. They pack em in as best they can."}
{"text":"Our food was excellent!! But we would have been happier taking it out. I understand coming in late is sometimes a pain but 9:05 doesn't seen to count when they close at 10:00. Our server tried to rush use the second we sat down. We asked her for a few suggestions, and her reply was \"everything is good\" and walked away. I'm sorry I've never been to this restaurant before and wanted a few pointers. 
   9:35.. Last call for us (as we proceeded to watch the bartender server others tell closing) Pizza came out and are checks did too. We weren't even through are first slice. 

      I'm not one too look down on things especially cause we have all been in her shoes. But customer service should be high on any business list. And not just standing around with the manager and other servers waiting for us to finish."}
{"text":"I definitely didn't hate this place but as a self-described pizza expert, I expected more from a place with the word \"pizza\" in the title.  

Pros:  nice long bar with good beers on tap.  The chefs are old style pounding the dough and throwing it around.  Service is quick and friendly. 

Cons:  noisy atmosphere and hard to carry on a conversation.  We were sitting near the open kitchen so other parts of the establishment may have been more quiet.  

I had the fresh mozzarella pizza with no sauce.  It was cooked well with a crisp crust, yet it could have had more flavor.  My dad had the calzone and liked it a lot.  

Parking here is tough with Mad Mex and Starbucks next door."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  I have to admit to being skeptical of roasted cauliflower on pizza, but this was fantastic! And just as good the next day for lunch! The traditional sausage/pepperoni pizza was good too. The coal fired crust was just delicious. The staff was friendly and service was prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"This place is the most confused Italian restaurant I've ever been to. The staff is phenomenal and I believe the reason is because they are working damn hard for that tip because the food isn't going to provide them with any joy. This place is extremely expensive and desperately wants to be some kind of upscale restaurant, but it is so very confused. The wings are awful and they don't serve ANY kind of sauce. Which, ok, fine. They're nice enough to walk around with samples, but the problem is, the food isn't good. It's supposed to be \"high-class\" but it has framed sports pictures, women in bikinis and obnoxiously loud lettering all over the place at random. What a strange mix, considering the rest of the restaurant is playing soothing music, with nice table spreads, and waiters who really cater to your needs like an upscale restaurant does. This place is clearly going through a weird teenage stage where they haven't figured out what they're going to be yet, and it is quite noticeable! The menu is so tiny there's really nothing to eat that looks good. The food is awful and not worth the money! Stop by and give those poor waiters some money, but if you want some good food with actual options, I suggest you go somewhere else. I'll give it 2 stars for trying."}
{"text":"I love their Margherita pizza and service was good too. Definitely gonna come back again"}
{"text":"I've legit never had \"coal fired\" pizza but after a friend recommended Anthony's I had to give it a try. Love it! Great crust and generous toppings! They have a great draft beer selection too. I'm not in the Pittsburgh area often but I'll def come back if I get up that way again! The service was terrific too. Our server was patient and made lots of great beer and topping suggestions!"}
{"text":"It was yummy! We had the roasted wings, they were so crispy & tasty, smothered n onions. We had a traditional pie with olives, sweet peppers, & mushrooms, the crust is thin & crispy. Well done like they say & we like! My son loved both the wings & pizza! They had $5 martinis on Wed too, but we chose the Peroni on draft. Music was a bit loud, but they did play good classic rock. I thought place was fun. So glad it is in Monroeville!"}
{"text":"When I first heard \"coal fired pizza,\" I imagined the sooty skies of old Pittsburgh and workers wiping their blackened brows- surely an oven powered by coal will also be sooty and smelly, right? 
As I understand it, coal is used to super heat the ovens at Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza to make their distinct taste, and it works. The mix of delicious recipes and coal oven cooking make Anthony's some of the best pizza I've ever had in Pittsburgh, or anywhere else.
I started off with coal fired wings- these wings are flavored and baked in the coal oven, giving them a crisp, roasted flavor, and then smothered in cooked onions and focaccia bread. The wings are plump and juicy, and I think the onions could be put on the menu by themselves- try putting the onions on the focaccia bread and you'll agree these are a party in your mouth.
Next up, we tried the gorgonzola salad, which has tasty greens, iceberg lettuce, onions, chick peas, hard-boiled eggs, and a healthy slathering of oil based dressing. If you like your salad soaked in dressing, you'll love this one, and the chick peas make a nice addition to this yummy salad.
However, the pizza is what we came here for, and I wasn't disappointed. I tried the sauceless Mozzarella, Sliced Tomato, and Basil pizza, which had very fresh ingredients, and the crust has a nice crispiness without being dry. Next up, I had to try the meatball ricotta pizza, which is made with their signature parmesan meatballs. This pizza should be outlawed it is so good. The juicy meatballs have a distinct parmesan and basil flavor, the sauce has a mellow tomato flavor without being too acidic, and the ricotta and mozzarella cheese were painted on thick, Plus, the crust was crunchy without being dry, again thanks to the coal fired oven.
I'm going back soon to try some of their coal fired sandwiches for lunch, which sound awesome, as well as a calzone that I saw another table order that was so big I could have used as a sleeping bag.
Check out this delicious pizza restaurant that has a warm interior. You might notice the Dan Marino pictures everywhere- that's because he is part owner of the South Florida chain, which brings a nice Pittsburgh connection to the restaurant. Also, make sure you say hi to General Manager John Mowod, who took the time to stop at our table to say hi- he's running a great staff that despite the restaurant just opening, ran the place like a well oiled-machine-- or a well fired coal oven."}
{"text":"Get the Margherita Pizza, add prosciutto and get a glass of their fresh, home made, red sangria.  

Sit at the bar.

Order wings for an app.

Look at all the awesome pics on the walls. 

Fast service and always nice staff!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. We have never had anything bad on the menu. Everyone is always friendly, that staff is always pleasant and attentive to us, we never have to ask for anything and always are satisfied completely when we leave. The eggplant pizza is a must have, along with the peppers and ribs. Recently tried the philly cheese steak pizza, which was pretty good, again no disappointments. Recently went to Bella Luna and Anthony's just blows all pizza places out of the water in the Monroeville area as far as Coal Fired or Wood Fired oven pizza goes. Anthony's really meets up to the upscale pizza parlor for an excellent dining experience. Definitely a must try, you will not be disappointed. Just caution PIZZA IS OVERDONE, which is a plus and also achieves that perfect coal fired oven taste."}
{"text":"The pizza options here are a bit limited - in my humble opinion - with respect to unique or unusual or interesting combinations. That said, last night I had the margherita: fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil (see photo), and it was delicious. I recommend, though I wouldn't rave about it."}
{"text":"I have given Anthony's two chances to get and it right and have been disappointed.  The service is slow even when the restaurant is empty. I have gone on my lunch hour and been late back to work. On my second visit, every table around me got served before my pizza came, even though I was the first table seated.  I am assuming something went wrong with my order but the server didn't feel the need to tell me.  While I was waiting, the host staff couldn't be more bored and was talking loudly at the front of the restaurant.

As for the food, someone needs to tell the cook that coal fired pizza doesn't mean burned pizza. A layer of soot on the bottom of my pizza isn't artisan cooking, it's a clear sign the equipment is not be used properly. I do not think I will give this place a third try."}
{"text":"No one should leave Pittsburgh without eating here. Their hot pepper coal fired pizza is probably in my all time top 3. Yes. That good. Another must try are the coal fired chicken wings. Truly excellent."}
{"text":"Brick oven char on edges of crust -- can anyone say 'CHAR?'  Just as the sign says, they do cook the pizza's on charcoal so expect some burnt bits.  It's not a minus by any means....it is definitely a plus to have some char to the meal.  Who can resist that?  
When hubby and I stopped in it was pretty busy since the restaurant opened up the week before.  
Alot of seating outdoors but we opted for inside.  We were seated at one of the high two top tables.  I don't recommend sitting at one of those because they are set up in the middle of a busy thoroughfare between the bar and the booths. Every time a waiter/waitress came by, I got bumped.  In addition, there was a blinding glare coming off of the floor because the sun was sitting just right.  So we moved the table sideways and it wasn't so bad.  We did try the sampler beer, which was a nice touch.  Not too much of one but little tasters of many.  
Our waitress brought us a 'sample' chicken wing. For us, it was just OK if you like all of the stuff piled on it.  Underneath, the wing was crying out for the heavy topping be served on the side.  
Pizza was wonderfully charred all around but we noticed that the center got soggy a little bit.  Wouldn't recommend ordering out and taking them home if you lived far away because it might be soggy in the middle when you get home.  Besides, once the box is closed, it takes away the crustiness of the pizza dough!  Pizza should be eaten just as it comes out of the oven, no?  
The pizza, the newness of the restaurant/bar, it gets a 4!  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza after a terrible experience at Cadillac ranch-which resulted in only one of us getting a drink(mine was \"forgotten\" about as they changed the tap) and no food. So we were rather hungry at this point and made our way to Anthony's about 30 minutes before they closed.To start, their drinks are insanely expensive for a quick bite after a movie-which was all this was supposed to be. However, my frustration from Cadillac got the best of me and I settled on a glass of wine-for $11.00. My boyfriend got a Yuengling which was considerably more reasonably priced.After reviewing the menu, we decided we wanted to make a pizza with prosciutto, mushrooms, and olives. Unfortunately, after ordering our server-who was incredibly warm,helpful, and attentive -came back and told us they were out of the prosciutto so we settled for pepperoni. The pizza, of course, was \"well done\" around the edges, however, the center was considerably underdone. The flavors were great and the pizza would have been excellent had it not been for the undercooked center. Overall, we will probably not be back-we had a total of 3 drinks (1 glass of wine,2 yuenglings) and the pizza and our bill was pushing $60.00 which is more than we had originally expected to spend for a quick bite to eat after a movie.And, as I said before, the pizza, although the flavors were good was undercooked in the center-which did not ruin the pizza entirely but came close to it. I do not feel the need to revisit this establishment."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of people over the years rave about this place so when I had movie plans at the nearby Cinemark, I decided to finally give it a try. Since we had plans after we tried to order reasonably so we didn't have a lot of leftovers. We were both in the mood for salad so we went with a small salad to share and a small margherita pizza to share. Judging by the prices on the menu I thought that both would be fairly reasonable in size to share. The salad was definitely more on the small size. I would have expected it to be a little bigger for the price point. The pizza was definitely tasty but I wouldn't say it was worth the price. I've had way better pizza for less. 

I did see a lot of people ordering the cauliflower pizza which looked a lot better than it sounded on the menu. While I probably won't be rushing to go back any time soon I would definitely like to make my way back at some point to give the cauliflower pizza a try."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. We always order pepperoni and sausage pizza and wings. The seasoning on the wings is just right and they are served with caramelized onions on top and a pita slice that I use to eat the onions with they're that good. The pizza has the perfect crispy crust and perfect flavor. It's always pretty busy when I go - only negative is the tables are close."}
{"text":"Anthony's Pizza is amazing!! Perfect thin crust cooked nice & crunchy.  Their specialty pizzas gave some great flavor combos & they even allow you to order half & half specialties giving you opportunity to try more. Calzones were HUGE as were their meatballs.
We did the half & half - half Philly Cheesesteak & half peppers, ssg, meatballs.  We also had the meatballs served in sauce w/ side of Ricotta. All delicious and service was good!

Only down side was after the above items had no more room to try anything else on the menu. So will have to return next trip to the area."}
{"text":"Good environment and fresh food! You could tell Anthony's uses all fresh ingredients for the items on their menu. Their menu is small, but they do everything extremely well. The Italian house salad was so crispy and the dressing delicious. The margarita pizza was so good, however I do wish they cooked the basil.

Max, our server, was outstanding! He was quick, attentive, and SO friendly. He had us cracking up. Seriously wonderful.

Only complaint is.. no ranch!! We really love ranch with our pizza, no matter how good it is, for the crust. They could make some seriously good house made ranch here and I really think they should consider doing so."}
{"text":"Meh.

There are some foods in this world that are meant to be blackened, like chicken and fish.

Unfortunately, pizza isn't one of them. 

I get that some people like a ridiculously crispy crust. I get it. I still feel like they could pull the pie out a minute earlier and it would be absolutely perfect. But nooooo, they want \"well done\" bread. Hate to break it to ya, but well done bread is burnt bread. 

First visit here was weird. I think it was during opening week so the staff was overwhelmed and working out the kinks. The floor plan of tables is somewhat cramped and all the soda is only served in plastic bottles that one would get from a convenience store. The roast cauliflower pizza was better than the other one I had with prosciutto, but its still nothing to write home about. MAINLY BECAUSE IT'S BURNED.

 Salad was alright and the smoked wings were cool, but not enough to make me go back regularly."}
{"text":"Great casual place for family and friends. Loving the chicken wings and the pizza we had: Young Ron something like that pizza."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where the mediocre reviews come from, but I thought this place was excellent. Very nice atmosphere and great food. I thought the wings left a little to be desired, maybe offer different flavors, but the pizza more than made up for it.  Cooked perfect, and great flavor. Kharma, behind the bar was very friendly as was the rest of the staff. Craft beers at $3 per glass made for a relaxing and inexpensive visit. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered a meatball and ricotta. It was 22$ burnt and one piece had an entire clove of garlic on it. Very dissapointed"}
{"text":"Coal-fired pizza is really great. It is served well done as all the servers explain, not burned as other reviews say. As good as the pizza is, the wings are even better. These aren't breaded wing drowned in sauce. They are skinless and cooked in the coal-fired oven with caramelized onions. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Not the best pizza I've had, but pretty good. They cook them \"well done\" which translates to a slightly burnt crust. The meatball and ricotta pizza was definitely the best of the four pies we ordered. The place itself is nicely decorated with old photo posters and there are a good number of LCDs showing ESPN etc."}
{"text":"I've been on a bit of a pizza discovery trajectory these days.  I'm planning a trip to AZ for what is supposed to be the holy grail in February and have recently just finished a trip to CT to what is supposed to be benchmark coal fired pizza places.  I have even built a brick insert to my oven and have been experimenting.  Sometimes I really want the gooey pizza of my youth.  That thick saucy and cheesy soft pizza that seems to be the easiest to find.  The newest wave are the wood and coal fired \"authentic\" pies of which this chain falls.  I'm judging it among it's peers and this type.

I ordered the classic with half olives and half mushrooms.  I liked the sauce and it had a good amount of cheese for me.  The olives were way too salty.  I know that kalamata olives are salty but these were not palatable.   I buy them and eat them a lot.  They should rinse these or get another vendor for them.  This wasn't my real issue with this pie.  It was the crust.  It's tantamount to me for a great pie, especially this kind of pie.  It's overworked.  They've forced all the air from the dough and it doesn't have any pockets left.  When you do this it turns cardboard-like and it also affects the flavor.  Handle your properly fermented dough carefully and you get a light, airy yet crispy and  chewy flavorful crust.  Serious swing and a miss here on this.  

The small salad is enough for 2 to share and was very good.  The menu is really nice and I like the place a lot.  There wasn't a service issue as so many other reviews have mentioned and our pizza wasn't burnt and in fact could have gone another 30 seconds or so.  There are a lot of choices in the area for pizza.  This place doesn't hold a candle to Harry's so I don't think I would return.  The do have some interesting lunch specials in the form of salads and sandwiches so perhaps I would try those or maybe even the chicken wings.  I'm not a big fan of chains so I'm leaning toward forgetting about this place."}
{"text":"After passing this restaurant often we decided to give it a try tonight!  I ordered a plain small pie, my tried and true test of a good pizza without the toppings interfering with the true flavor. The crust was dry and tasteless, the cheese was good while the pizza was piping hot but as it cooled it became hard and rubbery. The sauce was plain but good and the use of quality tomatoes was evident along with fresh basil. My husband ordered a 3 topping pie with anchovies, prosciutto and long peppers that were so hot he had to remove them, according to the waitress sometimes they are real hot and other times they are pretty mild, a comment I found interesting! His opinion as well as mine was it was just OK, we expected more but we have had worse! The waitress was attentive and the atmosphere was nice. It's highly doubtful we will be returning though!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was good. It tasted like I expected. However it is extremely overpriced. I paid $17.99 for a small pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni. I can't believe more reviews don't address this issue. I am not cheap with anything especially food but a simple pizza shouldn't be this much money. I will not be back as there are many places to get a good pizza in this area."}
{"text":"Super experience as first-time visitors.

It was a pleasant evening weather-wise, so we opted for a dining venue nearby with outdoor seating and this place did the trick.

Our server, Steve, was excellent and not only gave us drink and food suggestions as first-timers, he also gave us some nearby tips for us as newcomers to Pittsburgh, as well.  

We decided on a 1/2 and 1/2 pizza with Paul & Young Ron (Meatballs, Sausage, Hot or Sweet Peppers & Ricotta Cheese) on one half and Fresh Mozzarella Sliced Tomato & Basil (No Sauce) on the other half.  Note to self and others:  the hot peppers per my husband were very hot; I've not seen him turn down something hot before but after one pepper he had had enough.  I, not into the hot peppers, didn't even try them.  But, otherwise, the pizza selections were very tasty.

Steve even gave us a freebie of some chicken wings topped with carmelized onions.  They were quite good and I'd order them the next visit for certain.

To top it off, I ordered a sangria filled with apple pieces and my husband ordered one of the beers our server suggested.  We were both pleased with our selections.

Oh, and have to mention a few items of note (more for me than others):  While heading back to the restrooms, a picture caught my eye -- it was Muhammad Ali from my home state of KY.  And other KY connections were to soon follow.  as I entered the women's restroom, there were hunky men's pictures all around.  And, yes, there were George Clooney and Johnny Depp, again KY men.  There were other gorgeous men's photos, as well, it's just that the KY men caught my attention first.  What has that got to do with a restaurant review, you ask?  Not a thing, but it did add to my delight which is part of the total experience."}
{"text":"If 1/2 stars were a thing I would probably give this place a 3 1/2.

To start, the atmosphere was nice, we sat in an open air section kind of like a covered patio that had a few twinkle lights.  It was a quiet place, perfect for our Sunday night dinner.

We started our dinner with Anthony's Classic Italian Salad.  The small salad was perfect to split for two and the dressing was really tangy and delicious.  My only complaint about the salad was that they charged us to add cheese to the salad....they charged us $2.99 for like the tiniest little cup of mozzarella cheese ever! 

The pizza seemed kind of expensive too and of course when I tried to check the menu for prices online they weren't listed on their website.  I think it was around $20 for the large pizza and more if you wanted additional toppings.  We got a half pepperoni. half arugula pizza and both were pretty good.  The pizza is on a thin coal fired crust and you can really taste the smoky flavor.  The sauce is a more tomato-ey style but it was balanced out well by the other toppings.  Overall a little expensive but pretty good food."}
{"text":"This is a good pizza joint.  its kinda odd cause the tables and atmosphere are some what \"fast food\" feeling, if you order a soda they bring you a 20 oz plastic bottle and a red dinner glass of ice, they have a nice selection of beer ( thankfully in a glass made of glass).  the food is great though.  the wings are the bomb, the salads good and the pizza very tasty, again plastic cafeteria style plates.   Funny, I just think if they did a few upgrades to the overall feel of the place they would get 4 or 5 stars (and if you look at my reviews i don't give many 5 stars).  Close your eyes and enjoy the pizza!!"}
{"text":"I'm not one for chains, especially since Pittsburgh has such a booming food scene, but when you're in Robinson sometimes you have to settle. 

After seeing a movie at Cinemark, our group decided to grab a bite to eat. Luckily, Anthony's was able to take a call ahead for our group of 7, so we were seated right away (despite it being a busy Saturday). 

The pizzas are pretty decent, but after several times at Anthony's I'm noticing they really take the \"pizza well done\" slogan to new levels. As of recently I think they're charring the dough a bit too much. The family sized salad is great to share, with a great light and cleansing dressing. Don't miss out on the wings! They are roasted with caramelized onions and fresh spices... try them!! 

All in all, a solid stop if you're in the Robinson area and in need of a decent bite to eat."}
{"text":"If you have never been here, they will bring you a free sample of their wings. Great salad and great service. Highly recommend the eggplant pizza. The dough is made fresh! The salad pizza looks good, although I haven't tried it."}
{"text":"My husband and I grabbed a bite here before seeing a movie on a Sunday afternoon.  We ordered 2 glasses of wine and the square margherita pizza.  Despite our waitress admittedly having a bad day, she kept forgetting our order, the service was fast and friendly.  The pizza was cracker thin and ok.  We were actually left still a little hungry.  I wouldn't go back, it was nothing special."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on a Tuesday night.  Were seated immediately.

Pizza is fantastic!  This is not thick crust but the much thinner type crust that is more traditional of pizza in Italy.  I had the traditional with no toppings (more like a margherita) and my wife had pepperoni but both were excellent.

It's a little pricier and the pizzas are only 12\" or 16\" but it was the right size for one person and the food was great.  Definitely some place we will get take out from in the future."}
{"text":"Came with my husband for lunch on a Thursday. Located in the same lot as DQ. The lady working the front was very upbeat and friendly and showed us to our table. The menu is very odd and frankly I thought, hard to understand. What does \"our pizza is well done\" mean? Well, in case you're curious, it means they cook it til the edges are burnt. It literally means \" well done\". So, if you like a softer crust, don't come here! I also needed clarification on the every day personal pizza with salad and the side chick with salad. You could choose a personal size of any of the pizzas on the menu or make your own (that was awesome) that came with a loaded salad complete with chick peas, onions, tomatoes, hard boiled egg and pita. Or a side of what appeared to be chicken wings all for $10. It is a really great price for the amount and quality of food you get. I would like to come back to try the chicken option. The salad was a nice surprise, very hearty serving size. So much so that I took 3 of the 4 slices of my pizza home with me for later. Clearly no military discount here, since my husband was in his uniform and there was no discount reflected on the bill."}
{"text":"I was pleased to be able to secure a table outside without waiting, particularly as the indoor dining room was packed with diners, the tables too close to each other.  The spacing of the outdoor seating is satisfactory, but it was very loud, in part because it is not exactly outdoor seating; there is a barrier between the dining area and the actual outdoors, which keeps loud voices circulating.

Although our $45+ check is hefty for a meal centered around pizza, you get what you pay for and I cannot truly complain.  Our large 16\" Philadelphia cheesesteak pizza was $19.99 and it was delicious: done to perfection and tasty, the crust having the consistency of a cracker.  I like that there is fine grated cheese at the table.  We had a family size salad, $9.99, which was satisfactory, containing nice greens, chickpeas, slices of egg, tomato slices, a small hint of onion, in the house Italian dressing.  I would have liked mushrooms, carrots, croutons, more onion, and an offer of ground pepper, which was not made.

I was delightfully surprised to find that my excellent draft beer was priced at $5.00 including a souvenir glass, a bargain!

The menu is in need of expansion.  There are no appetizers per se.  Something like fried zucchini, which is a Pittsburgh staple, would be welcome. If the restaurant is going to offer an eggplant entree and a meatball dish, pastas should be added; there currently are none.  Dessert is limited to cheesecake and we were not asked if we wanted it before being presented with the check.  The service overall, though, was commendable.  The waitress was pleasant, welcoming, efficient, and she performed quality checks.

In summary, the food was good, the price hefty, but fair. The noise level was loud and the atmosphere was not one which provided for relaxation."}
{"text":"I got a take out pepperoni and onion pizza the other day. It was very salty and extremely greasy, I got the feeling they didn't use good quality mozzarella. I know the two come inherently with a pizza, but this was way more so than what I consider the norm. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped on way out of Pittsburgh and needed a slice and something wet to drink. This place is kind of located in an odd spot- half of a building it shares with DQ. What I liked about this is that the walls have a lot of chalkboard paint on the walls with specials and awesome looking drawings behind the bar with the PGH skyline and drawings of sangria and beverages. 

Anyway- walked in and with games going on sat at the bar so we could watch hoops (awesome idea). Ordered a couple of waters and then some sangria- white is better than red, and the bartender (tattoos?) was very very nice and accommodating. She made us feel at home, chatted with us and while training gave us some free tastes of drinks they were learning - including an espresso martini was very huge. 

We went with the philly steak pizza - which we have been on a big kick of lately together. This was probably on the higher end of ones we have had. Though I would have liked to have green peppers on it - the caramelized onions and cheese combo was very good and the steak wasn't cubed but more a sliced chunk jaump. We ordered a large and shared it going bite for bite on the last one - maybe my favorite part of a meal ever.  

Meal was secretly paid for - I owe you now, and we finished things off and watched the rest of the game. Finished my water and we hit the road, which was bittersweet because only real life was waiting- whereas I'd rather stay in my dream instead."}
{"text":"If you are on a budget, do not bother coming here.  My advice is come here with your friend and split a pizza.  It will still be one of the most expensive pizzas you will ever order, but it will also be one of the best.

The pizzas are well done, which can sometimes be a bad thing if they get really over done, but the crisp crust doesnt bother me.  Though our one pizza was way too well done to the point that no one wanted to eat the three slices that were scorched by the coals.

With that being said, you have got to get the Margarita pizza with garlic and tomatoes on top.  It is hands down the tastiest pizza you will have.  We got a Meatball and Ricotta that was alright, but I would never spend another $20 to get one.  Also, we made our own with mushrooms, pepperoni, and green peppers, and it was also delicious, but the best was definitely the Margarita.

The wings they have here are pretty delicious too.  They are not sauced at all, which make be a turn off for some people, but I just put some Parmesan cheese on them and they were fine.  In fact, with the pile of grilled onions on top, they were way better than just fine.

By the way, the tomato mozzarella salad was also pretty good, but once again, it is pricey.

Come here with a friend who is willing to split the tab, get a pizza, and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Read this entirely. 

Not a bad pizza place. I live in the neighborhood - love this neighborhood, AND all the restaurants in the surrounding location. This place is just OK when it comes to pizza. All pizzas are cooked in a coal oven and taste very good, if you like that kind of pizza. The bar area is also good, however it is a little pricey. BUT, if you are looking to go somewhere for an evening that is nice and has good drink deals and slashed prices on food - THIS is the place to go. they have great deals during weekdays and weekends for drinks - not just beers, but sometimes bloody Mary's and other times, spirits. I recommend THAT. 

Overall, I wouldn't skip it but I'm not in love with it. Best of luck in choosing."}
{"text":"The roasted cauliflower  and garlic pizza was awesome. Lot's of cauliflower . it weighed a ton!
The tomato and basil was also very good.  Plus I had the eggplant marino  entree and was very impressed.   Our waitress was extremely nice.We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now, and it's a solid choice - especially if you're going to the movies since it's right next door. Great pizza, good/quick service. My only tip - avoid the long finger hot peppers unless you can eat your Thai food at a 10. My husband and I are both fans of spicy/hot, but these peppers had us gulping down a pitcher of water after one slice. Oh and they don't have ranch, which is just... odd. Pizza + ranch = perfection. I still like it sans ranch though, so that's saying something."}
{"text":"This is my second time in Anthony's.  Went with Friend so we did splitsie's (I know, it's not a real word but you know exactly what I mean).

We started with a Family Serving of their Italian tossed salad.  It was really fabulous.  So fabulous that I might have to call and take on home for dinner on my way home from work.

Next came the House Sangria, red.  I am a sucker for any establishment's house sangria.  But I gotta say it was not good.  In fairness, the server mentioned that it just 'comes out of a bottle' and is was loaded with fresh fruits.  It was exactly that.  Strong \"True-Blood\" red wine with some chopped apple served over ice.  ~Um, no...  that's red wine with apple pieces...  we ordered a bottle of ginger ale to lighten it up.

Then came the roasted cauliflower pizza and we perked back up - it was enough to stop us mid sentence to congratulate ourselves on the choice.  It was slightly beyond amazing and we enjoyed it thoroughly, with enough to take home.

Service was attentive and friendly and I'll definitely be going back to try the eggplant pizza--  Yay summer at Anthony's!  

Note: apparently YAY is not a word, either!"}
{"text":"So the first time I came here I was really impressed with the pizza. They inform you that the crust is well done meaning that the outside is slightly burn because of the oven its cooked in. I didn't mind this seeing that the crust taste amazing all by itself. My favorite dish however are the meatballs served with focaccia bread.

The meatball is tender and just falls apart in your mouth and the red sauce that comes with it is just as good. The bread is warm and fluffy with a slight crisp topped with parmesan cheese and oregano. They also serve the with a side of soft ricotta cheese for dipping.

We ordered a large traditional pie and the toppings are $3 each and $2 after the first topping. That's pretty expensive seeing that you can pick another pie with several toppings for only $4 more. We did however find out that mushrooms and pepperoni's count as 1 topping so that was a plus. 

They serve about 12 drafts and I went with a yards brawler which ahas in a 12 oz glass but it cost $5.50. Again that's a little much. After order a large meatball (4 meatballs), a large pie with shrooms and pepperoni and my beer. Our total bill was $45. Not the kind of price I wanna pay for pizza so I will only visit this place every now and then.

I think the overpriced pie is due to it's location and the fact that they are way over staffed. For the small crowd of 20 people, most of them at the bar, they had about 10 waiters and 7 of them were just hanging around talking. Not the best look for a restaurant."}
{"text":"Everything was great! Pizza was delicious. Expect a little char on the bottom of the crust, but it is Coal fired....so obviously fitting. Delicious! Service was good, atmosphere as well. Family style salad is a must!"}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would. My husband and I didn't even make it past the drink menu. The prices are OUTRAGEOUS. A small pizza ( we were told this would be enough for one person if you ordered more food), was 12.99 for just cheese and 1.99 for each topping after that. Needless to say, if you want to spend 40 dollars on a pizza and maybe 10 wings at the most.. Sure. Doesn't include drink or anything."}
{"text":"Great Pizza. Nice beer selection.

Stopped in just before 10pm Friday night although there was an hour left before they closed, the wait staff seemed less than enthused to seat new customers. The place was practically empty, maybe only 4 other tables had recently been seated. We would have preferred to eat outside on the patio but the hostess didn't ask and we didn't request a change. 

Wasn't our first time here. Knew the Philly Cheese Steak was our favorite so we had that and a white pizza. It was very good.

Food- 4
Service- 1
Ambiance- 3"}
{"text":"I'm taking the star ratings very literally on this one: Anthony's is A-OK (3) but I'm not quite sure \"I'm a fan\" (4). The thing is this:  I'm an East Coaster.  I know I'm never going to truly get East Coast pizza in Las Vegas, anywhere. That's just the way it is. 

Having said that, Anthony's is very close to some of the best pizza I've had here, and they get at least a B++ for effort, starting with the young-John-Turturro lookalike waiter. 

The menu is simple here--only 9 classic toppings. I think they could do slightly better on that count, though I can understand why they don't offer things like pineapple. The crust is charcoal charred but still soft.
Paul & Young Ron, which is a meat and veg combo, needs a fork and knife...that would be the default choice here.

I was impressed most by the caprese salad-tomatoes, mozerella, basil and (in their version) roasted peppers. The quality of ingredients was as good in this simple dish as some of the finest italian places on the Strip. That says a lot about their dedication here. 

They have Peroni and Moretti beer, what you should be drinking with pizza (if not one of the decent wines by the glass)

\"Turturro\" tells me they get their biscotti from a relative's bakery in Brooklyn. I'm not a biscotti guy, so I don't try them, but I appreciate the effort.

It's a bit hard to find in Town Square, but definitely one of the better dining options there in the price range."}
{"text":"This past weekend was my first visit to Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza, and I hate to say it would be my last time as well.  But before you start slamming me for my two measly stars, allow me to break it down for you.

First, the establishment is clean, comfortable, friendly, and rich with tasty old world nostalgia.  We had the same \"Turturro-esq\" waiter that E.C. G. had (lol!) who greeted us with a (somewhat) authentic east-side accent.  Service was prompt and not over-bearing at all.  One star.

Now, it has always been my experience that whenever the word \"pie\" is used to describe a pizza, it was a dining pleasure.  This left me hopeful for a delectable dining experience here at Anthony's; my girl and I decided on sharing a meatball and ricotta pie.

It took a bit to get out to the table, which is normal for most custom cooked pies from any reputable establishment.  However, when it came out to us and I took a bite, it didn't quite send my tastebuds into orgasmic excitement as I anticipated.  I expected the meatballs to be hearty and savory with spicy abundance to offset and complement the otherwise drab ricotta.  It must have been on vacation or off the clock on this evening.

A friend ordered this dish called \"Eggplant Marino\", which was supposedly named after Dan Marino's favorite dish.  Now THAT dish was good and pleased my 'buds wonderfully.  So I highly suggest ordering this for your eggplant lovers out there!  Here's the second star.

Overall, I left the restaurant somewhat disappointed that pie's were their specialty.  My feeling is that if you claim something in your establishment's name, it better damn well deliver the goods.  Perhaps they should change the name to \"Anthony's Better Dish Is Eggplant Marino\".

Two stars is pushing it for me, but I'm in a nice mood today.  Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"We discovered Anthony's in Lauderdale years ago and every visit is delish. We order the same thing whether we are in NT, PA, FL...wings, salad extra gorgonzola,  pepperoni pizza. Fab fab fab. Our closest Anthony's is 4 hrs from home... Wish it was closer!!"}
{"text":"This place is average if not below. We went on a Sunday where not a ton of people were there. The service was slow and the food was not great. We got several pizzas, wings and salad. The best part was the simple salad. The wings were ok and pizza not very good. When I asked for ranch the server said they don't carry it, my husband said really? The response was expand your pallet... Not sure why the server felt the need to say... It was rude. The pizza was just average in my opinion, ok but not great. I would have rated 3 if it wasn't for the server. She was nice but needed a filter and a focus on serving the tables."}
{"text":"Decided to try this in an attempt to fill time before a movie. Service is efficient, and the food is great. The husband and I got a half white and half paulie's pie pizza, and weren't disappointed. Why the loss of a star? A bit pricey for pizza, and I wouldn't say it's my all time favorite, but we will still probably visit again."}
{"text":"Made my first trip to ACFP and I thought our pizza was great [we tried the roasted cauliflower pizza] and so where the wings.
I can't really add anything new to the comments already on Yelp about atmosphere...there really is not any to speak of...and the 3 stars are mostly because their prices are too high.
You will get however fantastic pizza and wings."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, service and beer selection. I look forward to another visit!"}
{"text":"Good but not typical pizza. Looks blackened but not burnt taste. In fact, surprisingly good. Great wings, but again not typical. Crispy and lots of caramelized onions which are yummy. No heavy pasta. Eggplant Marino is excellent. Just don't go there for traditional red sauce pasta. But it's great flavors and staff"}
{"text":"Hmmm.  It's smoking...Coal-fired pizza...sounds good.  On the door, on the wall, on the menu...It says \" Our Pizza is Well Done.   Look around, many pizza's with a somewhat burn crust...many smiling faces.  The coal is anthracite so it is clean burning..the oven gets really hot!

The decor is nice but mostly windows and a large square room with a long bar and lots of pictures mostly of local sports.  A couple of beers on tap, bottle beers, wines and drinks are available. 

A simple menu of pizza, salads, chicken wings and a couple of sandwiches. 

Had the coal-fired chicken wings which come out crisp with caramelized onions.   The onions were gooood but the wings were lacking flavor except for a little char flavor and a little salty tasting. The pizza was good with a burnt taste which gave it a subtle flavor of charcoal...not overly burnt.  The crust is thin as you would expect for a fired oven pizza.  Had Italian sausage as a topping and it was kind of sweet..was hoping for a spicier flavor.

The hostess and waitress where very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"\"Pizza Well Done\" is the motto.  Yes it is.  Our pizza crust was burnt. It you like to taste coal and burnt char the crust may suffice.  The pizza was pretty good.  Only one piece had a burnt bottom.  But I prefer my pizza not burnt on the crust.  So will probably look for some of my other fave places in the future.

The bar and patio are nice.  A little loud in the bar."}
{"text":"Overpriced.   We had two small (6 slice) pizzas for $40 and it wasn't good. 
The cauliflower pizza had no taste and the pepperoni just ok.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"First time there and the pizza was excellent.  We enjoyed the service as well.  They accommodated our party by letting us taste the sauce, worked with us to have cake that we brought in, and very friendly waitstaff.  Will go back when in the area."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Crust was a little too burnt for me, but they burn all their pizzas on purpose. Wings have no sauce and taste great."}
{"text":"As advertised, the pizza is well done. More on that later. The wife and I started with a small order of wings (10). From what we understand, the banana peppers are the entire pepper, so we opted not get them. The wings came out very quickly and were delicious. They come with sauteed onions and focaccia bread. There is no option for sauces, rubs, or ranch/bleu cheese; they come one way and that's it.

I would be remiss not to mention the craft beers that they have on tap. The wife had a Full Pint White Lightning and I had the Helltown. Since both brews are locally made, I consider this a huge plus. I should point out that all craft beers are half-price on Mondays & Tuesday. I am used to \"getting what you pay for\" with craft beers, but half-priced Mondays & Tuesdays will seal the deal for when I visit again. 

The main entree: a small pepperoni pizza. Six slices with a generous amount of topping. Yes, the ends of the crust are blackened from the coal-fired oven, but there is no shortage of warnings about this before you order. I should also mention here that the wait-staff does an excellent job of describing how everything is prepared prior to ordering. Definitely a plus for the first-timers. 

The atmosphere was bustling and there was a line at the door by 5pm on a Saturday. Be prepared to wait during regular dining hours, and whenever you visit, bring your pocketbook. It's all delicious, but definitely not cheap."}
{"text":"I was very underwhelmed by the pizza for the price! The salad was less than desirable. They don't respond well to customer complaints. They just simply ignore. Will not be getting my business every again!"}
{"text":"Great salad, pizza was meh. Service was so-so during our lunch. But there is nothing quite like an employee stealing your expensive and limited edition sunglasses the minute you leave."}
{"text":"Just ordered take out for lunch at the office and I was definately impressed.  We ordered the Eggplant Marino and I am wishing there was more.  It's not your typical pizza and that's not a bad thing.  The crust looks like it's burnt, but it isn't.  The Eggplant Marino had eggplant with marinara sauce and romano cheese.  It was definatley impressive.  They have a nice outdoor seating area that I will definately have to check out. The staff was also very friendly and courteous.  I will definately be back."}
{"text":"Another fantastic dinner at Anthony's! Great service and friendly staff makes coming here exceptional. We love the thin crispy crust on the pizza and the different take on wings with the sautéed onions."}
{"text":"Enjoy the pizza, salad and meatballs!  Service is up and down depending on who you get."}
{"text":"This is our second try for coal fired pizza.  We went in on a recent Saturday afternoon.    We started with an Italian salad.  It included chick peas and kalamata olives and was very good.

For our pizza, we went with the Anthony's traditional - mozzarella and plum tomatoes.  The pizza was really good.  Not your usual pizza.  The coal definitely gives it a different flavor.  We thought it was a nice change of pace.

For dessert, we shared a plain slice of cheese cake.  It was incredibly delicious."}
{"text":"This pizza makes my mouth moist...I love it. I also like the fact that I can go get curbside pickup in my sweatpants. The one time I ate inside, the waiter was very nice and offered to let is try this garlic dressing stuff; it was absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"Extremely rude management. I've never dealt with any establishment so poorly ran. I highly recommend avoiding this place and choosing another restaurant within the area."}
{"text":"It was OK...

My boyfriend and I came for a late lunch on a Friday. This was my first time here, and I wasn't impressed. This was a sports bar type if place that serves salad, pizza, and wings. The pizza was OK (could have had way better at IVP).

Ok... I understand that places are trying to be innovative with cooking styles, and making different things.... However, they should at least give you the option of condiments. We asked for hot sauce for the wings, and we were SHUT DOWN! I also felt rushed throughout the entire meal.... Probably won't go back in this lifetime..."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch , the Broccoli Rabe Pizza was so delicious. Great thin crust , perfectly cooked. Also great beer on tap ."}
{"text":"We never get the pizza here anymore...its just OK.  Its all about the WINGS!!  I had never had coal fired wings before but they are friggin delicious.  The rosemary, oil, the burnt ends, grilled onions, the juicyness of the wings altogether is magnificent.

I'm really big on making sure there's nothing left on the bone and I love chewing on the cartilage with the hint of the coal/burnt taste.  Plus they put some flatbread underneath all the wings which soaks up a lot of the flavor and chicken juice.  Goes great with beer!  They should cook whole chickens here."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a girlfriend. Place is small and will crowd easily since it is located near a multiplex theatre complex. We were told the pizza crust would be burnt but it was still tasty.

We ordered the eggplant pizza and enjoyed it. I was surprised that a place that charges so much to bring our soft drinks out in bottles. So much for free refills.

Staff is friendly and attentive. There are many eateries in this complex so it may be a while before I visit again.

It favors the younger crowd"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed in certain aspects of Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza. First, this is a tiny, tiny place, I'm guessing seating for around 50, with perhaps another 14 seats at the bar. The pizza kitchen is out in the open with two coal fired ovens glowing orange. Since one Oven is for pizza only and the other for sandwiches, when there are a lot of pizzas being ordered, it can back up, quickly!

This was the case Sunday when the gang didn't want to go to our usual spot for playoff football (the Rock Bottom) and opted instead for Anthony's. I kept telling them is was too new still, and on a Sunday afternoon would be ridiculously packed, and I was right. A table was a 45 min wait and we opted to sit at the bar, waiting for couples to leave or have their table called. Finally we were all able to sit at the bar, some customers were nice enough to move to other sections of the bar so we could all sit together. There is only one screen behind the bar and we were off to the side. (right by the front door, which made for a very chilly atmosphere, later four seats opened in the middle of the bar where it was much warmer) 

First disappointment: only two selections on draft?? Sam Adams and an Italian beer. I chose Sam Adams, no pint glasses here, pilsner glasses only. Extensive wine selection and bottled beer. It was only after I ordered a Sam Adams did I know they had Great Lakes IPA. The bartender never showed us a beer menu. 

When you order a soft drink, they go to a giant Coke display case like you'd see at Walmart or GetGo. Really? They bring you a bottle of coke or whatever you ordered and a glass of ice. The place is decorated nicely with really nice wood and brick and you have a Coke refrigerator? Lots of sports memorabilia on the walls and of course a signed Dan Marino jersey. Odd seeing Dolphin's pictures and jerseys in a Pittsburgh establishment.

The guys decided on pizza, they ordered a large, half white pizza with ricotta, mozzerella, and Romano. The other half was the \"Dan Marino\" basically a white pizza with sauce and breaded, fried, eggplant. A sign on the wall reads \"our pizzas are well done\" meaning edges are burnt.  For vegetarians they have a roasted cauliflower pizza with cheese, breaded cauliflower, garlic and olive oil. Because they were so crowded, our pizza took almost 35 minutes. The white pizza was ok, I added some parm cheese from the shaker and some hot pepper flakes to give it some flavor. The crust was nothing spectacular, its a thin crust with dark hues from the coal ovens. The guys all mentioned how quickly the pizza cooled as it sat on the bar. To be honest, this pizza wasn't that special, I've had better white pizza at Bado's in Mt Lebanon. This leads me to my second and biggest disappointment. If you bill yourself as a PIZZA restaurant, make sure your pizza is something special!  This pie was nothing out of the ordinary. I would much rather have stayed home, with a half tray of Beto's pizza and watched the games in comfort and growlers of beer from The Rock Bottom or River Town.

For the sweet thooths, there is only one selection for dessert, and it's cheesecake.

This seems to be the new \"in\" place for the South Hills. It draws an older crowd and families  It's noisy, lots of kids, small, crowded and really? ONLY TWO DRAFT BEER SELECTIONS? Really? 

I was seriously disappointed, the only saving grace was seeing the Packers lose on that sacred hallowed ground."}
{"text":"Very good food. Very good service. The wings only come one way and i thought it was strange that they come with onions but they were excellent. The pizza was not your average pie. Burnt crust on the edges is normal and we really enjoyed it. The roast beef sammich was awesome. It's a cold sammich but it was great. We will return."}
{"text":"Anthony's did not disappoint, as usual. We like other locations, saw this one. It worked out perfectly for a quiet dinner with friends. Pizza, wings and salads were good, service excellent."}
{"text":"This was my first time in the area and trying Anthony's coal fire pizza was pretty amazing so much flavor from 900F wood coals the crispy crust the wings were spot on with caramelized onions were really really good pretty amazing food here and also had the egg plant Marino which was like a silky creamy tender very tasty lasagna.  The red sauce is outstanding definitely be back again. Right when I thought I was done I received a complimentary taste of their unique ribs and sauce! Big thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Wings! Baked, not fried. Different but very good. Love the pizza. Great flavor in the crust and sauce. Not like the sugary dreck served seemingly everywhere else. This location can be rather noisy. Service has always been good. Many visits here since it opened."}
{"text":"Super-friendly staff and nice atmosphere!  Pizza is okay (slightly above average), not great.  The crust needs some improvement.  A bit burnt around the edges.  I gave 4 stars for the service!"}
{"text":"Great experience, meatball appetizer was delicious and the coal fired pizza was spot on!
We took an order of wings to go and look forward to trying them out.
Brandon was our server and was fantastic!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza,  two beers and a shared salad for lunch on a weekday. It was not crowded and we were seated immediately. Total bill for one 16 inch pizza (two toppings), house salad,  and two craft beers-$42.  First the pizza.  It was delicious from the center to the start of the crust.  Crust was thin and burnt as stated by many people, BUT in fairness,  we were warned that this would be the case by our friendly waiter.  Place is noisy and not conducive to conversation. TVs blared on this day and hour, and minor point, were tuned into a graphic hunting program.  No problem if that is your thing, but when this disturbed someone in our party, she did not get a response when they asked for it to be changed.  I looked around and did not see anyone watching it anyway.  Service was good, but the manager was a little overbearing with her interruptions and time spent with idle banter.  I will give her the benefit of the doubt that she was truly interested in \"how things were tasting,\" but it could also be a case of short term memory loss, in that the same interest was expressed at least three times. Salad was average at best and they charged an additional dollar for a choice from two cheeses. Nice selection of craft beers, but our waiter was not very knowledgeable about the details of each.  He suggested an \"IPA\"  that was not very hoppy. The main thing is, I feel $8 is high for a 12oz (at best) beer.  Even if they are half price at happy hour, this is pricey for even a craft beer.  The pretentious people of Peters Township may be willing to support overpriced pizza and beer, noise and cramped quarters, but the average person will take their hard earned money elsewhere and get the same or better quality of food, beverage, service, atmosphere, for a lot less."}
{"text":"Not bad for a chain. I think with Il Piazzaiolo and Mercurio's there's really no competition, but for a quick bite in Settlers Ridge, it was a-okay!

I ordered the roasted cauliflower pizza. The cauli was roasted to a crisp and I really liked the Parmesan cheese on top. An individual size pizza was plenty for a lunch portion too.

I also ordered a Bloody Mary since it was on special (I can't help myself). It wasn't horrible, but kinda boring. 

The service was incredibly friendly. I just wish they weren't blasting the AC, as I was felt like I needed a parka to eat inside in August. I'll take my pizza parka free, thanks!"}
{"text":"Went to Anthony's for dinner.  I wasn't sure what to expect from coal fired pizza.  I must say pizza and coal doesn't necessarily sound like a great combo, but we gave it a shot.  First impressions didn't help matters, as our plates on the table had a nice film of ashes on them.  I started with a $6 salad that was almost swimming in dressing.  Things got slightly better when my waiter was nice enough to give me a free sample of their wings.  They were baked in the coal fired oven.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, wings really are meant to be baked.  For our main course, we had a pretty basic pizza.  It was good but not great. The pizza sauce had a striking resemblance to Hunt's canned tomato purée.  But it wasn't bad.  Just not good enough to come back."}
{"text":"I've had this pizza twice and it's not bad. It's nothing to rave about and it's not great. And please stop complaining about burnt crust the sign is right under the name of the restaurant and right inside the door and all over the boxes and every where else. that says our pizza is well done. So it clearly warns you.. I think its over priced. I would rather have Betos or Fioris. This is a restaurant not a pizza joint and they only serve bottled soft drinks and only have 2 beers on tap. It's ok"}
{"text":"When there isn't a wait, this place is great. 

Food comes out insanely fast, pizza is DELICIOUS (the traditional pie is the way to go), the house salad is enormous (enough to feed 5-6 people), and according to my meat-eating family, the wings are great.

Wish they had more outdoor seating. Also, their soda comes in bottles, so if you're one to down three cokes during a meal (which you'll probably need to-- food is very salty), your wallet won't be pleased."}
{"text":"Salad was a ripoff with mostly iceberg. Pizza was good but could use more cheese. Atmosphere was nice and lively. Wait staff were nice. Service was relatively prompt."}
{"text":"Going back today to try a meatball sandwich. The pizza we got the other day was good so I figured I would try something else. It's a fancy  pizza shop that's it. The other poster said something about. $28 pizza. We got a lg pizza one topping and a pop and got out under $22 ."}
{"text":"The wings are among the best I have ever enjoyed.   The meatballs are good.   The pizza was not anything special, many other pizza shops are better.  The prices are higher than most places.  The service was excellent.  I will go back for a change of pace."}
{"text":"Pluses:  
(1) The pizza was good with big slices. The crust was thin with a nice yummy crunch.  
(2) Staff was very attentive and friendly.

Minuses:  
(1) The place is in an odd location within Town Square.  
(2) This place offers beverages in bottles; beer and soda. My husband wanted an Arnold Palmer (Iced Tea and Lemonade) and was told if he wanted that, he would have to buy the Iced Tea and the Lemonade separately!  So weak!"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out tonight after Yard House sported an hour long wait. Can't say that I'd go back... not because it was bad, but because it was just okay. And really, I can get okay a lot of places for a whole lot less. 

Mike thoroughly enjoyed the multiple flat screen TVs broadcasting the football game. We split a small specialty pizza- 1/2 meatball & ricotta, 1/2 white. The pizza was sort of bland and their signature burnt crust really wasn't my bag, especially since I'm a crust girl. 

The menu is small and items seem a little pricey for what you're getting. I generally like to rate places on craveability and I can't say this is a place I'd ever crave. I think there are better places to go..."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here. It was awesome! I came in a party of 5, we shared three pizzas and each were delicious. The staff was attentive and friendly and the manager stopped by each table to check on everything. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza.  Getting soda in 20oz bottles was odd."}
{"text":"Their pizza with prosciutto tastes like the pizza I got in Italy. Their house salad is unique and delicious. When you go for the first time let them know and you'll get a sample of their wings!"}
{"text":"Our order was simple pepperoni pizza it was very good  ...the crust was overdone as expected but the flavor was great. The price was above average for pizza so I won't be returning to often but I will eat there again.."}
{"text":"The pizza was great, but the guys that make it , while we were there they were scratching their heads, taking  their hats off to run fingers through their hair. And one guy that was cutting up something was eating. They need to wash their hands after scratching. Will not be back to this one"}
{"text":"I hadn't heard much about this place with the exception that it was expensive. As much as my wife and I enjoy pizza that bit of news kept us away. Last night we had a date night and figured we'd treat ourselves. 
As soon as we seated I thought maybe we had made a mistake. The seating and decor leave much to be desired. I realize it has a bar in the restaurant but I wish it looked less like a bar and more like a restaurant. Thankfully we were seated in a side section just off the main dining area. There was also a patio area to our right which would of been quieter and a bit less cramped. 
Doesn't sound like a glowing review yet but that is where my issues stop.  Once we agreed on a pizza, wings and some sangria I couldn't of been happier. As someone who works in food service I normally don't enjoy going out to eat even when the food is great. I was extremely impressed with the meal we had. The Philly Cheesesteak pizza and wings both turned out to be great choices. We even spoke about getting a second pizza to go since we were intrigued by another menu item.  We spent about 55.00 before tip for the two of us to eat and while it's weird having pizza cost that much it was well worth it.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan. This is just a personal preference. I'm not into thin crust pizza. The wings where not my favorite either. They did give us a small pizza for free to makeup for the mix up in our choice of toppings. Bottom line, not my preference for pizza nor wings."}
{"text":"The food was good, and we love the arugula.  Service was good and the bar had a great selection of beers on tap. My only complaint is the cold air draft.  The doors open up to the dining room, and several times both doors were held open, blasting the dining room with icy air!  Unless you want to be flash-frozen, sit away from the door.  In their defense, it's January, but I don't like eating wearing a coat."}
