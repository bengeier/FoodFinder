{"text":"This place is awesome, I walk in for lunch , there was a line but went quickly great for me since I only have 30 minutes for lunch, Joe help me with my order and recommended me the chicken platter it was great portion and very tasty. Will be back soon keep it up"}
{"text":"They served this wilted salad. Disgusting. It makes you wonder how fresh the rest of the food is. I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Solid Greek food lunch option! I had the gyro and Greek salad combo and it was great! I need to go back to try the hummus but my gyro was on point. Also the prices are great. My combo was about $10 and included a drink. Would definitely recommend this place especially if you work in the area."}
{"text":"I have been ordering the same salad for a long time via postmates from this place. 2 weeks ago  I ordered my usual Greek chicken salad and it looked like it came from an entirely different place! The \"chicken\" was greyish brown in color and not freshly cooked for sure , I had to throw the whole thing away. (I don't even think it was chicken) Thought I'd give then another shot today and same thing, \"chicken\" was gross looking, I got 1 olive, 1 tomato, and one slice of cucumber, no bell pepper! What happened to this place? It really went downhill :-( it was my favorite Greek salad to order for lunch :( but I won't be back....."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago so I know a good gyro. First off the customer service is absolutely horrendous. The owner walked past me twice and I was the only one in there. Not even a concern of \"how is the food sir\" he smokes cigarettes 50 feet from the building. The meat is DRY he definitely used old sitting meat for me. The fries were under cooked. Don't even get me started in the tzatziki sauce. Worst part of it all. This is the worst tzatziki sauce I have ever eaten. I would not recommend this place. Bring the old owners back!"}
{"text":"I've been eagerly waiting for this place to open up for few months so I was very excited when it finally did.

Inside it's very industrial with metal tables and chairs and bare walls aside from a few TVs. Good thing they have some music playing or it would feel sterile.

I got the chicken kabobs with rice and a Greek salad. Kinda spendy at $12 but you get a lot of food. Easily enough for 2 people. And it's pretty good.

Everything was fresh. Kabobs were cooked just right with neither the chicken or onions and peppers being over or under done. Rice was a little dry. Flavour was good.

Didn't even get to the salad as there was so much food."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see this place open in my neighborhood and decided to order pick-up via Yelp on Friday.  The process was seamless - the wait was 15 minutes (just enough time to walk to pick it up), the food was hot and ready and the staff was friendly.  We enjoyed a gyro pita and a philly cheesesteak pita - so very tasty...the pita was just perfect and made both of the sandwiches.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Saw it on my way to a nearby custom pizza joint for lunch and decided to give it a go. 

So good. 

Got a regular gyro w/no lettuce (lettuce really shouldn't come on these.) that was it. Simple. Flavorful. Hit all the right points. Def going to go back."}
{"text":"Here for a conference.  Perfectly fine for a brief and inexpensive lunch spot.  I like the gyro...not greasy, fresh ingredients, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Really like this place! Only giving three stars because there have been a few occasions when I have asked for no onions and have found onions in my food...

Other than that - they always have fast friendly service."}
{"text":"I tried this place when it was Pita Cafe and I decided to give it a shot again because I heard they changed ownership and name. The new ownership really made the place better! The new owners seem to know what they are doing. As an Arab, I am picky about Arab food, but this place does it justice. Try the chicken shawerma and falafel, they are really good now! This is my go-to place for Arabic food or Mediterranean food in general!!"}
{"text":"Im a huge fan of beef gryro but I was very disappointed. The food barely had any flavor, I was not able to finish it because it was so bland. I ended up giving my food to a homeless person. I ordered a gyro platter to go with fries and they didn't even pack utensils or ketchup for my fries. Ussually when I order to go at restaurants they always pack utensils and ketchup."}
{"text":"Ordered over the phone the following: Gryo Pita with a side of Greek fries, Dipitizer, and Kabob Pita. Went to pick up and once I got home I realized that I had a box of chicken.. assuming that's supposed to be the Kabob Pita, Greek fries, and the Dipitizer. 

I immediately called the store and told them that my order was incorrect; informed them that I was missing my Gyro Pita and Kabob Pita and that he only thing that was correct was the Dipitizer. The kid told me I was wrong and did not order a gyro or Kabob pita .I told him that I did in fact order a gyro and Kabob pita. He said he would make the sandwich with no extra charge and that I can just come and get it. 

Once I arrived to the restaurant, let them know who I was. They let me know that they were working on the gyro. I had informed them that I needed both the gyro and Kabob. The cashier kid again argued with me, continually telling me I was wrong. I ended up paying for another item, which is complete crap. Once they had made the sandwiches I had gone home.

Got home, opened big sandwiches and they both ended up being Kabob pitas. WTF. This job is not that hard. My boyfriend called the restaurant and told them that they messed up the order AGAIN. The kid on the phone told him we did not order a gyro sandwich. My boyfriend asked to speak to the manager, turns out there was no manager at the restaurant. 

The dishonesty was just ridiculous and didn't need to happen.

Giving one star because that's the minimum.. this is a no star review."}
{"text":"Great red pepper humus and pita and really good chicken shawarma ! Not too cheap not too pricey fair, kids chicken strip are good but you only get 2 strips so I wouldn't recommend unless really young kids."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a Gyro for lunch.  Very disappointed.  Very heavy on lettuce and very little meat.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner before a basketball game and it wasn't too busy during the week around 5:30pm. We ordered a Gyro and a Falafel pita with fries and 2 drinks. The gyro was decent (sizes are good and plenty) but the falafel was awful, dry, not fresh and hard. I still enjoyed my wrap because it had all the other fresh things I love: lettuce, beets, onions, cucumber, tzatziki, it was all good. Service was ok, nothing fancy. I'd go back because I'm a vegetarian and would be fine with a veggie pita and my gf said her Gyro was allright but I suggest stay away from their falafel, it was either really old or boxed stuff."}
{"text":"i really like this place. The food is fresh and hot when served. Very flavorful. Their pitas are perfect. Try the Chicken Shawarma!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is incredible, and not in a good way. I almost never give a one-star review, but in this case it's unfortunately warranted. Maybe they'd be better at a different time of day, but given my experience in this case, I doubt that I'll ever be back. 

I came here for lunch with coworkers and everybody got back to work late. For employees who need to be back at very strict timelines, this basically ruined everybody's lunch hour. 

Service: The interactions with the staff were underwhelming. Although we were greeted, it was clear that they were falling behind in terms of getting orders out. To make up for this, they rushed through every interaction they had. The four of us arrived and placed our orders. Three of us ordered the daily special that came with a side and a drink. The last person ordered a small plate of chicken and rice. Relatively simple right? At what could very well be deemed a fast-food joint, Athens Pita was exceptionally slow. 

We waited for about 20 minutes before I began to walk to the front to see what was happening. There was nobody at the counter so we waited some more.

And waited. 

And waited. 

Finally, 35 minutes into placing the order we get up to the front. Still no food. But an enormous take-out order was being made for a guy who looked like one of those Uber Eats guys. 

We inquired about our order and learned that it was 'almost ready.' Five minutes later, two of the orders were ready. And five minutes after that my order was ready. The lady who ordered the chicken and rice did not get any chicken and rice that day. She was already going to be late for work, so we ended up cancelling her order, which took even more time. There was an apology, but that was it. My coworker left hungry. 

Food: In all fairness, the food here is alright. It's definitely not the best Greek food I've eaten, and the meat portion in relation to the pita is pretty small. The Greek salad is decent though, and I was able to scarf some of that down before we went back to work. 

Atmosphere: There's plenty of seating, which is great, because there were plenty of people sitting around waiting for their food. 

I'm surprised this place has still survived in the downtown core. If this was a sit down place, I'd understand the higher wait times. But given the nature of this business, the wait is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Pretty decent gyro and for a good price. Great little downtown spot. Very friendly employees."}
{"text":"Our office has been anxiously anticipating the opening of this new eatery for weeks. So it came as no surprise that three of us ate here on their opening day. (I've been checking in to similar address that doesn't match the one listed on the receipts) And I can report that the gyro platter and gyro fries are simply fantastic!

The gyro meat had been consistently excellent on all of my visits. While I'm no fan of salads (I'd drink a salad sooner than eat one), the Greek salad here is delicious and fills like a meal. But my guilty pleasure have been the gyro fries: just the right combination of succulent meat, salty feta and crispy fries. Douse it in their Greek dressing and dipped into tzatziki sauce and you have a treat for curing those workday blues. This even heats up well if you can't finish it all at once. 

While the service isn't lightening fast, the food you get is tasty and filling. Price point is solidly within downtown budgets, and the staff have been most pleasant."}
