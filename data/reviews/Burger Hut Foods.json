{"text":"If you want a \"real\" and delicious burger, this is the place! I always get the 6oz combo (burger and fries) for lunch and it's filling enough to skip dinner later. Great deal and mouth watering food."}
{"text":"Fast and delicious food. Everything is cooked over a flame so you get the real bbq taste."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from friends how great it was but it was during the time of the previous owner.   Service non-existent. Food definitely not the same.  I would rather drive up the street to McD's."}
{"text":"Used to like going here before the new owners took over. Decided to give them a chance.   Ordered a burger and received just one slice of tomato for my burger and to them it seemed like this was standard operating procedure. Won't be returning.  Giving two stars to pay tribute to the place I used to like going to."}
{"text":"Not bad for burger and fries.  Gravy is tasty."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a burger. The onion rings were delicious and crispy, but frozen (as were the fries, they came out of a bag). My brother's friends all went crazy for the 6oz Steak burger, but personally, I didn't taste what all the fuss was about."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill since the ownership change in May 2009.  The food & service doesn't compare to the personal service you received from one of the owners (Larry) who cooked and served with a smile.  The burgers, souvlaki & homemade beer battered onion rings aren't made with the same quality & love as once before."}
{"text":"Honestly...one of the better burger places in Toronto....Nothing too great...but the 6 oz homemade burger is heavy and fills you up and they make their toppings great...I have paid double for a burger that just tastes like cardboard....so for that alone ...i will salute the Burger Hut for making a savoury burger when i really crave one."}
{"text":"I tend to come to joints like this for my burger cravings rather than the chains.  Burger Hut gets the jobs done.  Nothing horrible, nothing special.  Pros: Burgers made to order Prices are good  Cons: Place is really hot inside Burgers are frozen  As soon as you walk into this place, you notice how hot it is inside.  It's tiny, and doesn't have air con or good ventilation.  On a hot summer day, this place will be a little uncomfortable fro some to eat inside.  They have some chairs and tables outside on the walkway, but since it's not an enclosed space, you can not have alcohol at those tables.  (Boo)  The burgers are all made to order here.  The prices are pretty good.  $5 gets you a 1/4 pound cheeseburger here.  They only have pea meal bacon here so classic bacon fans will be a little sad. I ordered a 1/4 pound cheeseburger and fries with gravy (about $7) and another cheeseburger to share with my GF.  The burger is alright, they are factory made and come frozen.  If you're looking for a homemade burger here, you're out of luck.  They don't skimp on toppings here.  They give you a very good amount.  I've been to place where if I ask for tomato, they give me ONE slice. (Harvey's, I'm looking at you!!!)  You will not have this problem here as they give you good portions on whatever you want.  The fries were OK, again they felt very generic.  The gravy was pretty good (Is there ever a bad gravy?)  I might come back to try the onion rings because I love those but just didn't feel like them that day.  The staff were all very friendly and I had no trouble whatsoever while I was there.  All in all, Burger Hut will satisfy your craving if you're having one.  It won't be the best burger you've ever had but it gets the job done."}
{"text":"I paid $5.25 for a quarter pounder wt cheese, taxes included.  Pros: Toasted bun, good grill flavor, generous portions of basic selection of toppings, large portion.  Con: Burger was frozen and factory made (I was expecting homemade but not sure why). Meat quality was okay but not great. I'd give this place 2.5 stars if I could.  Bottom line: I probably won't return. I consider burgers a caloric splurge so when I have one, I wanna love it! I could have made a better one at home."}
