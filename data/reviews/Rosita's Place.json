{"text":"Craving Rosita's - have been coming here for 20 years. Never disappointed. The staff is so friendly and efficient.  The food is always fresh and mouth-watering delicious. Can't find a better place - and we have some great competition locally.  Spend locally, eat locally and support local jobs.  
Can't wait for the annual summer vacation to end and the doors reopen."}
{"text":"First off, best chips & salsa in town!!! Fresh, hot chips & thick, salsas. A flavorful red roasted chile salsa, & a nice and spicy green tomatillo salsa.
I had a habit of when I visited my father in mexico to visit every restaurant and try their version of the chile relleno, & the representation of it from Rosita's is a good as I can remember! My favorite mexican restaurant in town.
Authentic flavor, great portions, attentive staff.
They do tend to get very busy at times. So be prepared."}
{"text":"Very welcoming staff with great service. The refried beans here are among the very best restaurant beans I have ever had. The chili rellenos are good. Overall very satisfied and will be back."}
{"text":"I've been dining at Rosita's Place since the 80s.  It's probably my favorite Mexican restaurant overall.  Here's what I love:
Green corn tamales
Red sauce
Green sauce
Chili relleno
Wait staff (often the same waitresses who served in the 80s!)
Mariachis
Insanely large glass of iced tea
Atmosphere

I think Rosita's Place is the real deal.  It's not healthy food; it may not be particularly inventive food.  But it is done well, in a friendly environment."}
{"text":"Can you say SALT?  Yep, lots and lots of salt.  Don't get me wrong, I have been frequenting Rosita's for more than a few years and I have always loved their bean and cheese burrito enchilada style...oh yeah..and of course their chips and salsa are pretty tasty - as long as you don't take a big bite of cold harden grease on your chip.  Totally blows the meal, as you could understand. Pretty much only go if you have to have some sodium after a  heavy night of drinking heavily or in dire need of some good ole hip widening comfort food.  You'll probably see me there on a Sunday afternoon with the biggest pair of sunglasses I can get my hands on while popping Advil."}
{"text":"Another fellow yelper on here stated it correctly with some of the negative reviews...first world problems! The food took too long, it was greasy and another I saw said it wasn't as good as Ajo Al's (gasp! Btw my friend and I got food poisoning from there so I'll never go again). I've been eating at Rosita's for a very long time. When I graduated from ASU 10 years ago, where did I go after my ceremony? Rosita's! Mother's day, my birthday, a job promotion, just because... all at Rosita's throughout the years and it has never failed me. The chips are always hot and their menudo and posole is just like mom's. The beans too! Mmm! I know many friends and family who frequent Rosita's. If you're in a hurry go to a chain but for me, I'd rather wait for my Rosita's. Thanks for over 10 years of good food and memories! I'll see you soon!"}
{"text":"I'm used to paying double for less than what I got at Rositas; so that alone is a big plus. I tried the carnitas burro and it was delicious -- tender, flavorful, non fatty meat and I had a few sips of their mango margarita with chili powder which was quite amazing as well! 

I will definitely come to Rositas the next time I'm in the mood for Mexican."}
{"text":"Good was amazing as I had heard on here thanks guys. I got the chimichanga amazing in fact it was way to much I had to take the rest home. My girlfriend had ordered the menudo and she also thought it was very good just that they did not have any bread to go along with it. Now to the bad things as soon as I came in we had asked for a table the lady said to just sit there pointed and didn't bring any menus or even show us to our table. Our server granted she was slightly busy no more than a diner I think checked on us once. Overall 3 stars just because the front personel really did upset me"}
{"text":"Usually pretty nice, but we arrived  at 8:45pm looking to have a late dinner and was immediately greeted by a rude lady who suggested we order out food to go? I could sense she wanted no part of my family's need. Fuck you rositas and u mean old lady, plenty of other Mexican spots around here."}
{"text":"I first learned of this place by invite. Two of my closest friends suggested Rosita's Place as a place to meet for lunch and since my first visit, I was hooked and with any luck, you might be too."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Rosita's Place. This is the definition of real Mexican Food. I have gone here for years i tell everyone i know who loves Mexican food that they must go here. I am still surprised so many people in Phoenix still don't know about it. Also it is one of the best Albondigas i have ever eaten at any restaurant. Since i have moved out of state this is one of the places i miss going to on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This place has been a favorite spot for my entire family for 27 years now. The family favorite dish here has always been the green corn tamales with super spicy jalape√±o green chilies on top. Other favorites include the cheese enchiladas with green sauce, chicken and beef fajitas, soft tacos, beans and rice w/most dinner orders. Flan for desert. Freshly fried up chips and the spiciest salsa both red and green. If you're into very spicy mexican food, I highly recommend coming here. Truly a cornerstone of traditional PHX mexican food. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I drive 30 miles from Mesa to eat at Rosita's Place every chance I get. Been coming here for at least 10 years or more. Best Mexican food in the valley. Their green corn tamales. Yum! Cheese enchiladas, red or green are the best....and not to forget the awsome refried beans."}
{"text":"Dined here 200+ times. 

**My parents have been dining here for three decades - my review is prejudiced.  

Rosita's is the anti-Macayo's.  

As the above asterisks indicate, Rosita's is my \"Best Mexican Restaurant in Phoenix.\" I cringe at the use of the word \"authentic\" when discussing cuisine, so it won't be used here.  What I can say to supplant that generic word is that their food is unapologetically spicy, they don't cater to vegetarians or finicky diners, and their entire operation - from service to the \"security guard\" in the back - is unpretentious.  

I've known the most of the staff for my entire life, and for what they might lack in their eagerness to interact to the common diner, they make up in genuineness. 

Please Have - machaca plate, green chile burro/chimi, albondigas, chips and salsa. 

M. Flowers."}
{"text":"Good food with horrible service there  just a bunch of stupid lazy slow dumb half retarded lady's that should not be in any position to serve anyone ever!!!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews on here, so I was excited to try this place especially since it's so close to my house.   After eating there once, I doubt that I will ever go again.  I always judge a Mexican restaurant by the beans, and theirs didn't taste good.  I ordered the machaca (shredded beef with onions, bell peppers and tomatoes) tacos.  They came without any cheese.  WHAT?!?!?  How can you give me a taco without cheese!  The meat was OK but the taco itself was very greasy.  My husband ordered two enchiladas, one machaca and one chicken.  He liked the machaca but took two bites of his chicken and didn't like it.  I have to admit their horchata (rice milk drink) was good and a good size.  I know there's better Mexican food out there, so I'll keep searching..."}
{"text":"Brian's favorite place where we always came before the ASU football games. How can a dinner with eight women not be great !

Just another place missing Brian."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican food restaurants in the city. The food is authentic and the carnitas is excellent!
The location isn't in the best part of town but it's well worth going because the food in amazing and priced great. 
If you want good Mexican food with large portions this is the pace to go."}
{"text":"I've lived in the Phoenix area for eight years and have eaten at dozens of different Mexican places looking for the best food. Rosita's Place has consistently come out on top. Their refried beans are the best I've ever eaten. Let me say that again: their refried beans are the best I've ever eaten. I like their carne asada burrito and their green chili is also good. 

The building looks a little worn from the outside, but inside it's very clean and the service is always good. I wish they had other locations because it's a long drive from where I live in Chandler."}
{"text":"This is where it's at! If you are looking for really good, cheap and somewhat late night (I think they are open till 11pm) mexican food, you've got to try Rosita's. I absolutely loooove their mole sauce-- best in the Valley. Try the beans and rice burro, enchilada style with mole.  Pair it with a nice cold Pacifico-- Sunday afternoon Heaven! Their salsas are to die for, and both the red and green pack some serious punch!  You've got to pay a dollar for chips, but it's so worth it. The tamales are also muy delisioso!

The little old ladies who work here are absolutely adorable in their little matching dresses. They are no nonsense, too. There's a sign posted that says \"Please control your children!\" I love it. Plus, they have a kick-ass temporary tattoo machine at the front where you can buy \"Dogz\" tattoos, with realistic looking dogs in gangsta settings. Classic."}
{"text":"Start off with their fresh chips and salsa. Outstanding way to start off. Food portions are big, come hungry leave happy."}
{"text":"Tried their take-out the first time, it was great - good food, fresh meat, and big portion.

Went there for lunch at the second time, very good food and it was cheap too. BUT, never order the spicy beef burrito - accidentally ordered it since the waitress spoke Spanish to me and my co-worker(time to study spanish now..), and we both got caught in this spicy dish. Couldn't finish the plate, and stomach did not like it. 

But in one word, good Mexican food. If you happen to be in that area, worth to go."}
{"text":"I'm from New Mexico, and being right next door, you think it would be easy to get some familiar grub. Not so! Unless I'm headed over to my mom's for dinner, my quest for food familiar to my taste buds has pretty much been a bust.

Although it's kind of weird to have a bunch of koi fish in a too-shallow, too-small space right when you walk in, that (and the fact that Rosita's is, indeed, in a sketchy part of town) is the only detraction.

The food isn't New Mexican, but it is yummy. I've eaten here several times. The tacos are okay. The chicken flautas come loaded with tons of sour cream and guacamole.  A friend of mine says that you can tell the quality of a place by their rice and beans, and Rosita's doesn't disappoint.

Where Rosita's shines, though, is in its soups and green chile meat dishes. Go starting in October for the best posole. Or order the green chile burrito, enchilada style. The chile isn't for wimps, and the meat is tender and melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"I would consider Phoenix to be one of the worst towns on the planet for Mexican food with the exception of Rosita's Place, which I think to be the best place on the planet.  I was living in Phoenix back in the mid-80's and pining for LA-style Mex when I came across a review for this funky place on Buckeye Road.  I'm tellin' ya, my life changed after a single meal there.  No longer would I say that Phoenix had no good Mexican restaurants.  Time and life has taken me to different places and I now live thousands of miles away, but when I get a long layover at Sky Harbor, I'm happy, because it means I will have time for a meal at Rosita's.  My personal favorites are the red AND green chile, so I usually order the half and half, unless I'm going to be in town a few days.  The chips and salsas are the best in the US.   I LIKE the area that Rosita's has moved to.  After dinner some night, take a drive through the trailer park in back; it's like a time warp into the '50's and there are some really cool old Lucy and Desi trailers in that park."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and I have to say that they have the best menudo I've had so far in the valley.

Service is a little slow but I kinda like that for a Saturday morning breakfast place... never feel like you are being rushed out the door.

I would like to come back and try some of their other food but for now I'll be coming back for the menudo"}
{"text":"I'm Happy Camper, Every Good and Great Food and Services, Good Fresh Menudo  and Chorizo Burrito, My Family's were every with the Food and Services, All The Time, Love Every Weekend."}
{"text":"Have been going there for years. Can honestly say we've never had a bad meal. One of the best places for Mexican  food in Arizona. We drive 30 miles to eat there and it's worth every mile. Service is always good. Those of you who state there are way better Mexican places around to eat really don't know Mexican food. Reminds me of going to my Nana's house when I was young."}
{"text":"Based on previous yelp reviews, I was hoping to find another phoenix gem but alas I was dissapointed.

The one thing about the reviews that was correct: service is not great.

Here's the simple lowdown:

Food is a solid 3

Chips and Salsa were decent - chips were nice a warm

Guac sucks - its the kind that they make every so often and put in refrigerator (try los somberros or bario cafe for real gauc)

Taco - good flavor on the ground beef - but taco was luke warm, like it had been sitting 10-15 minutes

Food Smell - I'm not sure if this was because I read on previus review...But I did notice a wierd smell to the enchilada."}
{"text":"Really good menudo and salsa and fresh chips are a must .. The prices are great and the food is real mexican home cooked meals ..."}
{"text":"The Menudo is the best! The machaca is muy Bueno . Highly recommended . Large portions to top it off. We thought the service was great, some reviewers criticized it , but that's not the case."}
{"text":"Had a bowl of menudo and it smelled and tasted nasty and our waitress was rude and chips were full of oil and salsa was old NEVER AGAIN WILL WE EAT THERE and now I am at home with a stomach barf..."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time for the raved about menudo. I had the white menudo bowl and it was good. Not spectacular, but it satisfied my pregnancy craving for menudo. The only set back was that it took FOREVER to get the menudo. My mom was already almost halfway thru her meal and the chips were starting to fill me up a bit. But I really wanted the menudo I came for so I patiently waited. That and the service was not good. The server barely came around or not at all to check on us. We didn't speak Spanish but that's all they really tried talking to us in. I could understand some but my english responses were still answered in spanish. I thought that was pretty funny. I may come back during the day although the time we went was at night, it really was not that busy or packed  for a Saturday."}
{"text":"I lived in Phoenix for 12 years before I found this place - now I would never recommend any Mexican restaurant but this one for friends from out of town or newbies.  Rosita's chips are the best - it's worth a trip just for the chips.  I usually eat there at least once a week - the cheese enchiladas with green sauce are my favorite, but occasionally I stray and have never had anything that isn't wonderful.  If you like soup it's also the place to go - surprising for a Mexican restaurant, but soups are amazing."}
{"text":"Just had the BEST Abondega Soup! This place is the real deal. Just like Momma makes it at home. First place in AZ I'd give a thumbs up for their Mexican food."}
{"text":"Rosita's Place is one of my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Valley. I usually get the same thing everywhere I go and base my judgement on that one item. I order the green chili burro enchilida style. Rosita's offering was so good that I sometimes crave it and drive from Scottsdale just to get one. The salsa is always hot, and sometimes hotter, but very good. Just make sure you have your water in front of you before you try it. Any time I have out of town visitors, this is the place I take them."}
{"text":"Just walked out, after waiting over an hour, for an order of posole and a taco.  I asked for an order update numerous times, and I was given muffled answers and zero eye contact after 45 min.  Maybe the crew is having a bad day?"}
{"text":"We have been going there for years, and putting up with poor service because the food was good.  Our recent visit was our last.  The waitresses all act like they are exasperated that they have to wait on us, bordering on rude.  We try an experiment every time we go in.  We watch numerous customers come in WAY after us, and order AFTER us, and get their food BEFORE us.  We chalk this up to only one thing.  We are white, and the others getting better service are hispanic.

Now that the food is not satisfactory, I see no reason to go back.  My beef taco was a mixture of mealy beef and chunks of potato.  It was so disgusting I couldn't even eat it.  There has been a definite change in the food from years ago.  Yuk.  There are plenty of better places out now that have better quality food and GREAT service."}
{"text":"Worst service ever first time we went there was overcharged and bad service...thought we try it again had bad service...call speak with manager about being overcharged explained the situation...returns my call explains that I undercharged the second time I was there don't even talk about the first charges or the bad service....  What a great manager mother and daughter....don't fix the situation if there an owner like to speak with him ..the foods not all  that service sucks....don't mind paying for food and great service....long story short watch your tab ...then to end conversation I tell her that we just don't need to eat their if they can't explain my first charges. Her remark ok....I'll give your 15 cent"}
{"text":"Went to Rosita's yesterday for lunch while waiting on car repairs. In and out in an hour no problems. The best Machaca ive ever had! Our chips were steaming hot when they were delivered to out table. Guacamole, salsa were all bomb.com. I would recommend this place to anyone. Great flavor, fast service"}
{"text":"This is as classic and authentic as a Mexican restaurant you could hope to find.  The red and green salsas were filled with heat and flavor from the smallest amounts.  The dark mole on chicken enchiladas was outstanding.  Only 8 mins from the PHX airport so stop by during your next layover."}
{"text":"fantastic food  portion are realy big . combination plates  are awesome  the waitress  are very good"}
{"text":"The food at Rosita's is great, the service fine. Their salsas set the standard for the area. The only issues with Rosita's have to do with the neighborhood and the parking. That aside, Rosita's is hard to beat for a balance of price and overall quality."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. I ordered two cheese enchiladas and soft chicken taco, it was too salty and greasy. Lemonade was delicious, but personally, wouldn't be ordering enchiladas again. Overall, nice interior and they do play nice music and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Hey Yall...i knew i would find EXACTLY what I was looking for...I want to tell me peers when they fly in, but I want to keep her a secret....I LOVE ROSITAS...Carmen was my prompt and courteous server...i I ordered the carne asada burrito enchilada style with rice and beans it came with a side of guacamole and a little lettuce salad. The Carne Asada Steak inside of this burrito was totally undeniably freakin awesome, awesome like a FOODGASM in my mouth the meat was tender, flavorful, juicy, and I could see & taste the spices WHERE IN THE HELL do they do that at well let me tell you ROSITAS. This has to be one of the best things I've ever eaten since I've been in Phoenix, Arizona. The mom and pop setting remind me of home the loud crazy people didn't bother me it's a small restaurant it's time to be expected. Don't do yourself an injustice by leaving if it's crowded what are your items to go. I love guacamole but I didn't enjoy this one because I could tell they add Southwest spices and I like mine plain."}
{"text":"Listen this is true old school Mexican cooking.  If your on a Diet stick with water with lemon or leave it at the door pick it up on the way out.  We eat here all the time but today was the bomb so good their green mix all green enchilada style OH MAN ITS GOOD staff is always very friendly the owners and her family are very accommodating their menudo is some of the best and not to many restaurants have good menudo this place is very good and you get a lot for your money affordable"}
{"text":"I went to eat lunch a saturday got a seat right away.  

I had fast service.  The Server was nice.

The food was delicious.

I recommend this place it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Love this place.  If I wasn't on the opposite side of the continent I'd go there all the time.  They start you out with a basket of smoking-hot fresh chips and salsa that's spicy enough to hurt but so tasty you can't stop eating it.  Everything I've eaten there has been good.  My favorite thing to get is a machaca burrito.  Excellent rice and beans come with it.  I go every time I'm in Arizona and I wish I was there right now!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Rosita's Place for several years now, and this restaurant is one of my favorites.  This is the type of place you can trust to go to anytime, with anyone, and have great authentic Sonoran Mexican food.  Lately I have been getting the short ribs.  Yum!  Everything is good.  The chips here are the best for sure.  Simple, delicious red and green salsas.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years.  Is the service slow at times, yes it is, do I care, No I do not.  
They charge for chips, because they can, and they have the best ones around. Happily pay the dollar extra. 
Don't come here if you don't like lard in your refried beans or cheese on mostly everything.  That is how we like our Mexican food.  
My go to is the ground beef taco (potato/ground beef mixture) cheese enchilada and beans.  I can't go wrong with that.  We live in Anthem now and still eat here about once a month."}
{"text":"The service was bad.  The waitress had a bad attitude. I don't know what was her problem, but she was unpleasant.  Also, the waitress got our order wrong on my friend's dish.  The waitress was also difficult to find.  Perhaps she was very busy in the back.  They charge for chips and sauce on top of the burrito.  They kind of nickel and dime you.  You can't substitute items with combo platter choices, so that wasn't so nice. I ordered a 2-ground beef taco platter.  I was expecting ground beef.  But instead the taco meat was a patty composed of potato, fried beans, and a little meat.  It was different, but it didn't taste good.  The menu should tell you that the taco meat was like that.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Just for the two salsas alone I give this place 5 stars:  that wonderful green and also a maroon salsa------both with a good kick!  I've eaten at Rosita's Place a hundred times and I went again last night.  Honestly, sometimes I can tell when a different cook is in the kitchen, but my cheese enchiladas with the GREEN sauce was the old, wonderful recipe----you've got to order to green sauce.  The diner behind me was orgasmic about his dish, so I had to ask what he ordered:  STEAK PICADO; he gave me a sample and it was mighty tasty with intense heat.  As long as they can get that cheese enchilada right with the green sauce i will be forever devoted-------heck, if they served nothing but the unique green salsa and chips I'd dream about this food!

Don't go here for the tacos or the chimis, but stick with the enchiladas, or cheese crisp or steak picado.  To go to some place like Tee Pee or Don Carlos or Milagro is just silly when you can go to Rosita's Place------this is the real deal, folks!"}
{"text":"Wow! every dish I've tried here has made me wiggle in my seat with happiness.  Love the sauces.  Delicious. Homestyle goodness."}
{"text":"Food quantity was good, the meat on a chimichanga that i got was Salty as hell i told the waitress she pretty much ignored my concern and kept doing her business might not go back there again."}
{"text":"Ordered a shrimp enchilada to-go and I'm pretty sure the shrimp was bad, it had overwhelming smell of bad shellfish. Had to throw it out."}
{"text":"I've been here a grand total of three times, and I probably won't be returning any time soon.  It's not that the food is flat out bad, per se, it's just that there are many better options nearby. The first time I went on a recommendation, and the food was... OK. The 2nd time I went the food was still only... OK. The third time... well, you get the picture.

The first obvious knock against Rosita's Place is the chips and salsa. They're not bad, but they're not complimentary. Given all the competition which offer free chips and salsa, you'd think these would have to be pretty darn special, but they're not. Good, but not outstanding.

Secondly, the rice and beans are just OK (that descriptor keeps coming up in this review). The chicken enchiladas were fresh, but lacked any real flavor or spice. The machaca, which is supposed to be  one of their specialties, was soggy... a BIG no-no for a dish that is a specialty in this region.

So, honestly, while I wouldn't discourage anyone from going here, I'm not sure what some of the hype is about, especially when Rito's, Tacos De Juarez, and Comedor Guadalajara aren't that far away."}
{"text":"If I could leave zero stars I would. Honestly I have no idea how this place has four stars. First of all the customer service here is awful and I mean awful! They were rushing us to order as soon as we said the first word of the order they interrupted us then asked the next person in our group. Also when we ordered the side of guacamole, and the waitress brought it over she went around the back side of our table and practically tossed it on the table. She didn't even bother saying excuse me or sorry. Oh my gosh and the quality of the food is horrible very very horrible our guacamole was old and brownish, it tasted awful. When we got out main dishes the carne Assad burrito was basically a giant asada taco no beans or rice inside nor onions and cilantro not even pico de gallo. Oh not to mention the chicharon burrito had a hair in it to top it off. We also ordered a carnitas burrito that was super dry I had to take a sip of my drink to even chew it. The asada burritos had no flavor at all. With my dish I had a hard shell taco which was supposed to be ground beef but it looked like something caned and that was smashed up. When we asked for cilantro,onions, and lime they brought us some old ass cilantro no onions and the lemons were old and brown. I have no idea how this place functions with poor quality food and service. Please do not waste your time and money here! The only good thing this place has to offer are the mints. Lol!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! It is open late, which is the best part, if you are looking to eat good food late...  The salsa was awesome and the low prices are ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"A coworker brought me here about a month ago and I was genuinely surprised when I walked into this place.  It was pretty clean and colorful in everything you expect from a traditional Mexican restaurant in the valley.  Plus, they had individual La Rosa candy for sale at the register. 

They could accommodate our group of 8 pretty easily at lunchtime and although service was pretty slow, it was a decent experience.  I think I had red cheese enchiladas and was pleased enough with the flavors that my husband and I returned here this past weekend. 

It was early Sunday afternoon and there were a handful of people in the restaurant.  We were sat in the booth in the far corner by the server station; where the seat is pretty well worn and the vibration from some nearby machine rattles your back.  We asked to be moved to a booth by the window; this time I scored the good seat and my husband got the lumpy one (score).  

Chips are hot (charge: $1) and salsa is pretty good.  His machaca plate order inspired me to get machaca red enchiladas this time.  The machaca was pretty drippy with oil/water and it flooded my plate so I sent it back for some posole- there was really no saving the plate.  I understand it's Mexican food and greasy but it was a little more than norm.  Our extremely nice server that reminded me of my Tia was gracious and gave me a squinted eye \"I agree\" when I kindly made the request.  The posole was downright tasty- and pretty meaty- a very thick red chile broth that was more stew like, nice texture on the hominy and served with lemon and minced green onion.  It had a nice kick to it.

Overall, it was a solid 3-star experience."}
{"text":"It was awesome. I was just passing through Phoenix and found this place on Yelp, I would suggest you go."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. The beans, rice and enchiladas are  the best.
The locals know this place serves great food. Don't let the outside of the Restaurant stop you. Recommend asking for separate salsa bowls for sanitary reasons. The Waitress only brought out 4 same bowls for party of Six. Would stop there again."}
{"text":"Great food! service is \"meh\". I love their asada tacos and plato mixto, and while their staff are friendly, they are not always attentive and many times there is a long wait for your food. I keep going back though because the food really is worth it!"}
{"text":"Authentic to the core! Coming from Portland, Oregon, I wanted authentic authentic Mexican food as we don't have much there. My cousin recommended this place and we came for dinner. We asked the owner (couldn't tell if she was actually the owner), and she recommended the Mexican plate. We got that along with Pozol√©, and both were delicious! She delivered hot chips and salsa right when we sat down and it was fresh and authentic. Overall, great experience, definitely one of those hole in the wall places, but definitely won't disappoint!! Oh, did I mention that their potions are HUGE?? GO GO GO!"}
{"text":"Great food.  I ordered the chips and salsa.  Costs a buck but was worth it.  They came out hot.  And I loved the house salsas.  Only negative was that the chips on the bottom were covered in grease.  They should shake out the grease more but otherwise fantastic. Then I ordered the Carne Asada burro with a side of beans.  It was heavenly. Good flavor.  Tons of meat,  good guac.  Again,  I knock a star for the grease. It was dripping out of the burro. The beans were the best I've ever had. I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat.  They just need to cut back on the oil and I'd love it even more."}
{"text":"I don't know how many Margaritas some of these reviewers HAD becuase these people were ANYTHING but fast!!

The dining room wasn't even full and there were 3 servers and yet it took them nearly 30 minutes to take our drink order! I wanted to leave, but my friend wanted to eat there soooo bad so I decided to give it a try. After our food was ordered, it took ANOTHER 30 minutes for the food to hit the table... Our server then brought a round of refils and the check and we didn't see her for the rest of the night! 

I did enjoy my dinner, the food was better than good. I had menudo, which wasn't anything great. I've had much better menudo on the rez! OH! and they didn't have any cilantro!! I was shocked! so my menudo lacked soul. :( I got a side order of beef  taco which was good. :) I liked it. 

The salsa is KILLER!! I kept trying to eat it so I'd get used to it... no such luck! But it definatly released the endorphans! And cleared my sinuses... and brought a little water to my eyes! And that says a lot, cuz I can handle a lot of hot food!

Over all, I dig the food, the place was very colorful and festive. Which is always a plus. I could do without the mariachi band. oh DUDE! the band almost got into a fight with one of the patrons!! The patron was all drunk and kept requesting songs, and I guess he didn't know it was $3 a song, so they wanted their money, he didn't have any and that's when things got U-G-L-Y!! It was funny cuz the guy was drunk but yeah - it's $3 a song! But yeah, I dig that rough environment. 

I honestly think it was an isolated incident, overall it was a nice place. I recommend sitting by the window and just enjoy your self while trying to handle the salsa!!"}
{"text":"Best food and prices around. Real Spanish food! We will return. The Owner seats you and she is very nice. I enjoyed myself, thank you."}
{"text":"We've been going here for 25 years and I had my first BAD meal recently. A rotten chicken tamale, the corn meal might have had rancid fat in it or the chicken was rotten, either way it was stinky. The wait staff didn't seem outraged and shrugged it off as though this has happened before.  I may go back here in another year, but Rosita's Place is off limits for me now."}
{"text":"A small, inexpensive mexican restaurant in Phoenix that you must try if you are into spicy food. It's not one of those posh restaurants, so expect that kind of service. If you care about the food more (and you should, unless the service is horrible), you won't be dissapointed.

The hot salsa they bring with chips is superb. I tried their chicharrones burro and machaca burro. Both were really good; especially the gree chili flavor the chicharrones had was awesome!"}
{"text":"This has to be by far the best place in Phoenix to satisfy your craving for Mexican food i have been going to Rositas for over 10 years now they started out in 1964! That definitely tells you they're doing something right when i usually go i tend to order a bean burrito enchilada style red with a side of rice and beans the beans are to die for creamy and cheesy and the enchilada sauce even makes it better oh also the menudo red and white is superb with all the trimmings i prefer the white and i add some of the red salsa to give it a kick they have so many things to chose from you can't beat tacos,burritos,Chile rellenos, soups(pozole menudo(Served everyday by the way) there is so much more of and they have some of the best margaritas made with fresh squeezed lime so give them a try I'm sure you won't be disappointed just beware they tend to get lines out the door on Sunday's but they do take reservations good luck!"}
{"text":"The food is above average Mexican food.  It just takes so long to get your food."}
{"text":"I grew up in Northern CA, Santa Cruz specifically. I was spoiled with fresh Mission Style Mexican food. This is the closest that has come to it. Their red salsa is amazing and reminds me of the salsa I enjoyed growing up. I ordered 2 red sauce Cheese Enchiladas with rice and beans. It's not as good as NorCal Mexican food but pretty close. It's the best authentic Mexican food I've had in Phoenix! I would've given 5 stars but they didn't bring me my chips right away and brought them right before I got my food."}
{"text":"Nice food and service priced just acceptable. Could use some fresh salsa with the chips. Be aware that when you are asked if you want chips it's because you will be charged for them. But if that holds down other menu prices I'm ok with it. Definitely recommend to visit."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic and they have menu items that other restaurants don't. The posole, vegetable soup, and menudo are available on certain days...all pretty good. On weekends, it gets busy, so it's best to get there early. When I'm craving a sit down Mexican meal, Rosita's my first choice when I'm in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"The Barrio Cafe was really busy, so I decided to accept Yelp's recommendation for Rosita's Place. The portions were generous, the prices were fair, and the food was good - but nothing special. The neighborhood seemed a little marginal, so I was glad they had their own parking lot in back."}
{"text":"Fucking delicious!!!!!! Ask for a large margarita. Best service. Salsa is spicy but amazing. Got sat right away. Everything was great. I will be beck for sure."}
{"text":"I'd heard great things about this neighborhood joint so I thought I'd give it a shot since I was in the mood for Mexican. 
The experience started out lousy. The sign says \"Please wait to be seated\", the place wasn't all that busy yet we stood there ignored for about 5 minutes before we were told to seat ourselves. 
Once seated, we were brought chips which were hot and fresh but we didn't get any salsa to eat with the chips until we'd finished about half the serving. 
I ordered the carne asada taco combo plate. The rice and beans were ok, but my carne asada was very similar to whatever Jack in the Box fills their 99 cent tacos with. Whatever it was, it had less flavor than the Jack in the Box tacos and cost much more. My carne asada didn't resemble meat at all. 
The food sucked and the service was substandard, I will not return."}
{"text":"Can I tell you how much I love this place! I am going to!!   The absolute best Mexican food in the Valley. I love the Chicken soup here. Nothing is better.
I was sick with a respiratory thing and this Chicken Soup was my saving soul food.
I stopped in to get it to go about 5 times during my illness. I drove 22 miles round trip and worth every step.
My experience here with the food has been above and beyond our expectations every time. The food is fresh, and delicious. The Chicken soup is heavenly and if you do not feel well. It is all you need.
The chips and salsa and fresh and wonderful!
Cheese enchiladas, Chicken tacos(hard shell), and the Beef tacos,my favorites on all of these. 
It is family owned, which might be another reason it is so good. They really care about the food,how it tastes, if it is hot, and fresh.
It is very clean here, as well as the restrooms. You must park in the back ,that can be a little tricky if you have a large vehicle. Just go slow. One way in , and one way out. 
If I could give them 10 stars I would."}
{"text":"The menudo red or white is the best here!  Also the best green chili chimichanga, and the albondigas.  Mmmm mmmmm"}
{"text":"There aren't a ton of restaurants and are ABSOLUTELY PHENOMINAL.  This is one and, dare I say, is the best mexican food in AZ.

I've written a fair amount of reviews and this one is likely to sound gushy enough to make my wife jealous.

Their chips are made fresh.  Not made fresh that day.  MADE FRESH FOR YOU, right when you order them.  They charge $1 for a very large basket.  Salsa is free.

The only thing I am not a fan of there is their red salsa, but thier green is so damn good and so damn hot.  I pay, but its worth it.

Ok, now the beans. Oh my God!  They are so creamy and perfect.  I highly suggest you order a side to go along with your chips.  I live a solid 30 miles from this place and will drive here JUST for the beans.  My wife loves beans so much.  Its almost unnatural.  She could seriously sit down with a plate of beans, thats it, and be happy.

She get absoluely giddy when she knows we are gonig here.

Rellenos.  Oh my God AGAIN.  I can't even describe how wonderful they are.  They really are unlike any other restaurant's I've ever had.  First off, they are huge. Secondly they use a batter that fries up so light and puffy.  So you have this slightly crisy, kinda fluffy exterior surrounding strips of relleno pepper with the most luscious, ooey gooey cheese in the center.  I dump a ton of their green salsa on top and just go to town.  All you'll here from me are moans and sighs or delight once it is put in front of me until I'm done.  They actually continue a god 30 minutes after I leave as I replay the feast in my mind.  WOW

The chicken enchiladas are perfection, the machaca is oh so good, tacos are cripsy goodness.

Here's my order...  Chips with green salsa and a side of beans while I wait for my a la cart cheese relleno and either a chicken enchilada with green sauce (not salsa) or a machaca taco.  Depends on what mood I'm in.

If I eat the whole thing for lunch.  I don't eat dinner.

There are only a couple places that really deliver every time like Rosita's does.

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

DAMN I LOVE THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"Rosita place is a quaint little Mexican restaurant. The service is great and I've never tasted a better cheese enchilada in my life. All my family is coming in from back east and I'm taking them they're the best Mexican food I've ever put in my mouth!!!!"}
{"text":"What a find!
I found this place thank to my trusty Yelp app. I wanted some good, spicy Mexican food and Rosita's Place seemed to fit the bill.
In all honesty I was planning to go to Los Dos Molinos, but they are closed on Sundays...

You park behind the restaurant and walk around the front, dodging a few cars along the way.
Walking in, I loved the atmosphere. It was bustling and full of life, but not overwhelmingly busy. We were seated at a table just past the indoor fish pond...hmmm.
The service was prompt, the chips and salsa came right out. The salsa...oh the salsa, it is delish, full of flavor and lots of heat, but in a good way.
I ordered the chicken enchilada plate one red and one green. My companion ordered the green chili tamale plate (out of this world good).
They arrived glowing hot! The plates and food were so heat hot we could not start eating for about 10 minutes, (which allowed us to enjoy the ice cold beer). 
Once the food finally cooled to a manageable temperature it was amazing!!!
The flavors were spot on, the chicken was super moist and each sauce was great. The refried beans here are like crack. I was so full but could not stop eating them. Yum!

I'm pretty sure I have found my go-to Mexican spot in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Good food + server was a nice old lady
But over priced for the quality you also have to pay for your own chips and salsa, at a Mexican restaurant that is a little shocking. After our meal the girls at the front entrance where you pay for your tab we're ignoring me when I spoke to them and made it obvious that their conversation was more important than getting me out of the restaurant with a happy smile. Which was sad because it ruined my mood considering that fact I was so happy and excited to go see Disney on ice after dinner. Over all nothing has the wow factor so this is one of those \"I'll stop by once to try\" and that's about it places."}
{"text":"It's \"okay\" but nowhere I would go on my own volition.  I've been here twice with coworkers and the service was pretty slow both times.  We've always had to have our food boxed up soon after it finally arrived.  I also ran into the slow refill issue that others mention.  The food was okay, but they're very heavy on the sauce and cheese.  My chicken enchilada was decent, but didn't blow me away, despite the \"most authentic\" praise others waxed about this place.

I also don't think the koi pool (it's not made to look like a rocky pond or anything natural) is very sanitary, so I'm subtracting a star for that.  It really should be an enclosed aquarium when it's right in the middle of a restaurant like that.

I'd go back with coworkers if this was where they wanted to go, but as for myself, I am sticking to Los Tacquitos."}
{"text":"I really wanted Chilaquiles when i got there but i also wanted Menudo.  I ended up ordering the Red Menudo and it was really good.  There was no fat in it and most places give you a lot of fat in your bowl.  I did need to use the restroom seeing as i am pregnant after the meal, but the stahl was locked from the inside. I told the front desk but they didn't do anything about it at the moment so i had to stop somewhere else.  The food service was great otherwise."}
{"text":"Would have gave them 5 Stars their food is excellent but if you're in a hurry this is not the place for you servers are pretty slow"}
{"text":"Came here for my Saturday morning Menudo and Hot chips and as always very fresh hot  and flavorful if you love Menudo this is the place! The red is just as good but spicy!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants when visiting Phoenix. The place doesn't look like much, but the food is really good. We have a lot of good Mexican and Tex Mex places in Dallas and I still rate this highly. I recommend either the chicken burrito or if you are up for it, the chicken chimichanga. There is something about how they make the chicken there that is the best I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant. They don't put anything but meat in the burritos, so get them with the green chile sauce and definitely order it \"enchilada\" style (melted cheese). The refried beans are great too. Others I've gone with love the pork carnitas."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place back in 1997 & have been going ever since. I've introduced friends, family & co workers to it. It's not in a good neighborhood by any stretch of the imagination (come on it shares a parking lot with mobile home park). So you know it's good right? Right! The waitress staff minus the young one have been there FOREVER & treat you like your very own Tia (mexican for aunt) & are very helpful & knowledgable. Love these ladies. The Divorced Eggs are perfect every time. If you like 2 sunny side up eggs, hot fresh tortillas seperated by a line of beans but can't decide between red or green sauce this is your freakin' plate. The posole while only on the menu part of the year is the real reason to visit. The guacamole is good good & the chips aren't free but are cooked to order hot & fresh. So go forth & enjoy some great Mexican food. 
Tip - the green salsa is hotter then the red. Don't say I didn't warn ya."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the real deal Mexican food. This is the place. Just don't judge the book by its cover. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Several Customers of mine recommended Rosita's. Our new favorite place. Thanks Fred Wadsworth / Midway Commercial & Fleet Sales Manager."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food.  Both the tomatillos and hot salsa were very tasty.  The portions were huge!  The chorizo taco was wonderful.  The chicken burrito on the combo plate was a meal by itself, packed full of white meat chicken.  The fresh lime margarita was a great compliment to the meal."}
{"text":"Been eating here for over 20 years and plan on eating here for another 40!!!!  Love the tamales, red chili, tacos, salsa, mole and everything else I've tried!!! One of the Best Restaurants in Town!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! The wait can be long though you can call ahead and make reservations.  Our waitress was older Mexican woman with a man look on her face.  She reminded me of my grandma.  

The plates are LARGE so..come hungry or eat left overs the next day.

I ordered the tostadas- they were huge and so yummy.  The strawberry lemonade was the bomb!"}
{"text":"I sat down at 2p saw server she gave me salsa no chips. Ordered food at 210 and 230 rolled around still no food told server I had to go she said she would be right back 5 minutes later she comes with my food. I seriously had to go so I asked for a box 5 minutes later.box comes. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"I went to Rosita's Place yesterday after reading the Yelp reviews. I have to give this place 3 stars. The food was great. They give you a great portion of food. The waitress was friendly and attentive. The only issue I had was upon initially walking in, the hostess sat me right near a large group of people. I was alone and didn't really want to eat near a lot of people,  especially when there were other areas that were empty. I had to ask to sit somewhere else. She let me pick. I found another spot, but I was initially overwhelmed by the smell of bleach. I guess they use that to clean the tables. It went away. But I thought that was worth noting. The food was good though:)"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great ambiance and service.  Always has a crowd of people out front but don't let that discourage you. I was seated quickly."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Rosita's since the days on Buckeye Rd in the mid 1980s.  I left Phoenix long ago, but never come through without a stop at Rosita's.  Remarkably, the quality of the food remains as good as it was in 1985 when New Times considered it the best Mexican in town.  I'm a huge fan of the red and green chile and the chips and salsa might be my last meal if I were heading to the gas chamber.  I was amazed to find the efficient older waitress in the main room still there.  She waited on me in 1985!"}
{"text":"I hate that I have to give this place only two stars because their food is great.. The reason why is because their service is terrible. We sat down for 20 minutes before the lady asked for our order and drinks at the same time. The only reason she came is because I had to ask another waitress to call her over to us. After giving us our drinks, we waited for an hour before our food came. People around us were sitting down, eating, then leaving. Our waitress didn't even tell us our food is coming or apologize about the wait."}
{"text":"YUM! Right by my new job, they picked this for a going away lunch and I am sure glad they did. It was fantastic. I had a bean and cheese burrito with green chili sauce and it was huge and delicious and very reasonably priced. We were a large party right in the middle of the lunch rush and the service was still great and food pretty fast. Everyones meal looked great and they all reported that theirs was amazing as well. The place is not fancy but a good vibrant atmosphere. Can't wait to try more items and go back over and over!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The atmosphere is welcoming, and let me just say that the chips and salsa are to die for! This is the closest to New Mexican cooking I can find. For the last 10 years this has been my go-to while away from home. You won't be disappointed! These other reviews are soooo faaaar offfff!"}
{"text":"Flavor was actually pretty good. Not used to eating menudo with tortilla but it was pleasant. Lemonade had a very good flavor. Did not have to ask for a refill, it was brought to me. Service was prompt and my food was at my table in no time. It was not really busy either so maybe that helped. Good experience!"}
{"text":"I am not sure I have reviewed this restaurant but I have been eating here for years (at least 15, probably more) and they are always awesome.  Rellenos, carnitas, sides, salsas, they are always great."}
{"text":"ICK! Not impressed AT ALL! I had some terrifically terrible tamales, but actually ate only half of one tamale, as I donated the remaining 1 1/2 back to the restaurant. (I had to take several bites to make sure I hated it.) I would have given one star but decided to add a bonus star for the friendly staff and bucket o' cola. I was thirsty."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here, and I don't think I am going to be able to eat dinner! I am still full.

I went with 7 other people for lunch today. The place was packed & we had a party of eight people. I thought we would have to wait forever. We didn't have to wait long though. They had a big party room in the back and they put us in there so we didn't have to wait. Thank God for a restaurant that was willing to be helpful! I was freezing because the A/C was cranking, but everyone else thought it was great. I think anything below 74 degrees it too cold, so my perception could be a bit off.

The waitress brought us super hot and delicious chips right away. We had our drinks in a few minutes, and she took our orders right away. I was crabby since I was starving, and I was stoked to be scarfing down those chips! 

She took our orders right away and the food was out to us pretty quickly. I had pretty great enchiladas, rice and beans. Everyone else was really happy with their food too. I ate more than I usually do because it was really good, and as a result, I am still full six hours later.

Great food and service, I can't complain. I haven't tried the margaritas here yet, so I can't fully evaluate, but so far so good.

I'll do an update once I've boozed it up here as well!"}
{"text":"Visited there a few weeks ago. Had an amazing bowl of posole and the best bean burrito I have ever had. The micheladas were ice cold and delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for as long as I remember. Since 1995 at least. Their food has always been consistently good.
Service has always been a little on the slow side, but that is typical in the Mexican Restaurant way. I find the slow service forgivable because the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"I eat here 2-3 times a month after visiting the DBG. This is the real deal for Mexican food. Pozole and menudo are very popular. My favorites are chicken enchiladas with mole sauce and the chile relleno.   Rosita's has been family owned for 30+ years. The service has always been friendly and attentive. 

Regarding some of the comments: 1) This is not a fast food restaurant, go to Taco Bell if you want that. 2) This is not a vegetarian/vegan restaurant."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food in America! Way,way goood! Very happy with the servce,thank you."}
{"text":"My husband and I are in town celebrating his birthday and catching a Rams/Cardinals game. My cousins who live in Phoenix highly recommended this spot for a good Mexican breakfast. My husband looooves menudo so we decided to give this spot a try. The restaurant is clearly popular, has lots of customers & offers a very deep list of delicious foods. After waiting for roughly 15 minutes they call our name and seat us. Not bad, only a 15 min wait at what looks like is going to be a good experience. After sitting at our table for 10 minutes & seeing two families that were seated after us already being served, I get up & ask the hostess what was going on. She apologized & a very nice gentleman also apologized and immediately asked us what we wanted to drink & brought us chips/salsa. He jokes with us about how the Rams are going to lose and we all three laugh. He had great personality & got the experience back on track. A woman comes over and takes our order, has a bitter look on her face & has zero personality. A rock on the side of the road has more personality than this woman did. We order, tryyyying desperately to get our experience back on track since our cousins recommended this spot & sadly the experience never got back on track simply because our server was dull. Borderline rude. Our food wasn't bad at all, my husbands menudo was delicious he said & my beans/rice burrito was good too. The salsa is delicious & I was happy they had Jamaica. When I went up to pay the bill the woman at the counter apologized again to us, said she removed the drinks from our bill and I told her \"no worries\" & that we left a cash tip and to enjoy the rest of her weekend. All and all, I gave this spot a 3 stars. Simply because the server couldn't smile, make any conversation with us & ultimately pulled our overall experience mediocre. The others who interacted with us were kind, apologetic & genuinely wanted to make our experience positive. Next time we are in town visiting we may give this place another shot. If not, we wouldn't be losing out on much."}
{"text":"Don't expect good cuts of white meat chicken or premium meats mostly dark meat food is okay I've been here 4 times and each time I wonder why I came back"}
{"text":"I come regularly with my family. Over all the food is good but they charge for tortilla chips and I have never seen that before. I had the chicken flauta combo, the rice and beans were delicious but the flauta didn't have any favor to it. The guacamole would be better if they didn't add tomatoes to it and just kept it avocado only."}
{"text":"Stopped by last Saturday. Underwhelmed as a whole. Chips and salsa to start- a red and green. Nice spice!  My wife got the chicken fajitas and they were very bland. We actually just tossed the leftovers because neither of us really wanted a 2nd hit. I had the mole which was good enough but I've definitely had better. It seems like a popular place though so maybe we hit it on a bad day but with so many great options in the area, I can't see is returning."}
{"text":"It's a nice place but, not to be taken for a restraunt.  The food I ordered took over 1 hr for me to see, the meat is basically jack in the box meat.  If your not Hispanic or don't speak Spanish don't expect to be welcomed or treated with proper kindness.   I was very disappointed.  STAY AWAY!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I saw they were open for over 60 years so I really wanted to like this place. I went with an open mind and the waitress was great at first and got our drinks out fast but after asking for our order about 2 mins into us sitting down and we replied we want nachos but we need a few more minutes to choose our entree, it was a wrap. Took 15 mins to get our nachos and they didn't ask us for our order for at least 30mins. I made eye contact to let them know we wanted to order and they just walked away. About 10 mins later I walked up and asked someone working here if we could order and she said yes and Walked away for 10 more minutes... At this point we were over it and not hungry from the 2 lbs of cheese on chips that were supposed to cost $5.75. By the time the lady came back to take our order we weren't really hungry and just over the whole experience, so we asked for a check and a Togo box to take home the nasty nachos. Not sure if it was an honest mistake or not but she charged us $10 for nachos that cost $5.75. Such a joke. I really wanted to try their food too but they lost me. They need to realize phoenix is growing since 1964 and they need more than 1 hostess, 1 server, and 1 busser. I'm sad. Will never return. Gross food, shitty service. try ritos, comedor Guadalajara, el norteno, el carbon, tacos Julisco... And if you want American Mexican food try tee pee, ajo als, don Jose, Los Olivos, I am passionate about Mexican food and this place is a complete joke. Please do yourself a favor and skip this place."}
{"text":"This place was ok 
Rice and beans were delicious the burrito was huge but the meat was not the best choice. Although the flavor was good the meat killed it for me I like my green chili with a different type of meat not shredded beef. The shrimp cocktail was big for an appetizer and the price for it was good too. it was lacking   In flavor but still good. Overall the flavor of everything was just ok not a huge wow for me except the rice and beans they were amazing. Would prob come again because the price was good and overall it was pleasant place to eat"}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I come here. Got the Devil's Shrimp and it was awesome. If you like spicy food I recommend you try it."}
{"text":"Always has authentic Mexican cuisine.  The wait staff has been there for years. The plates are too big BUT...I dare you not to eat it all. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Phx for years and never heard of this place. Must have driven by this place multiple times without ever stopping. So glad I stopped in today.

Very clean. Excellent service. Excellent food!! Excellent hot sauce, if you like spicy stuff. 

Rosita's Place is casual dining. Shorts and flip flops are fine.

I'll definitely be back and recommend others!!"}
{"text":"In my constant search for newer, faster, and more interesting routes on my commute to work from CenPho to Tempe, I've been passing by Rosita's a lot recently, and coerced my husband, who came home the other night and said, \"Carolina's?\" to try Rosita's instead. Boy, was I sorry. 

Let's start with the mariachi musicians who stood so closely behind me that they completely invaded my \"stranger bubble\" and I was forced to move my seat at the table. Next, there were the chips which were just ok to begin with, and ended with gobs of congealed grease after they had cooled a tad. Then, hubby's machaca chimi was fine, with decent flavor, but my pork carnitas was so dry it was literally inedible. You could look at it and see that the sliced pork was so dry it was like the dessicated flesh at the Body Worlds exhibit. Gross, I know, but so was this meat. It simply should not have been served by a conscientious restaurant. 

Next time, I won't contest it when Hubby suggests Carolina's (who serves the best chimis and by far the best tortillas in town)."}
{"text":"I've been going to Rositas for probably 10-15 years and mainly at lunch during the work week. The tacos are great, the enchilads are chessy and taste good but also a gut bomb that makes you want to take a nap. Unfortunately this has always been one of my go to places and would normally give it 4 stars; however, I finally took the family this past Sunday and the food was OK not as good as usual and the service was awful. The waitress did not seem happy to be serving us, got one of the orders wrong (which we couldn't fix because we didn't see her for 20 more minutes), we got the tortillas for fajitas 20 minutes after the fajitas and the check took another 20 minutes to wait for. I would typically go here every month but hadn't been in a 3-4 months so I am hoping this was a one off and the next visit will be better and not that the place has gone down hill."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to today. The food was nasty the tacos were nasty and the chips were old and dark brown from old oil. Truthfully the only thang I have ever gotten here is the posoie."}
{"text":"I like Rositas. They are affordable, and the food is always consistent. 

The lunch specials are awesome, I recommend burritos enchilada style. The chips were a little stale, but that's par for the course for most Mexican restaurants.  

The waitress we had this past visit was amazing. She was engaging, but not intrusive. Our drinks were always full, and she even offered \"To Go\" drinks... 

My mother and I were catching up after a while, a she didn't chase us out of the booth, and even continue to offer refills on our iced Tea after we closed out the tab. 

One of these days, my husband and I should split something, so we have room for desert because I saw a plate of fried Ice cream walk by, and it looked delicious."}
{"text":"No trip to Phoenix is complete without a meal at Rosita's Place. The mixed red/green chile plate is my favorite - the hot-from-the-fryer tortilla chips are always perfect & the service is always spot on."}
{"text":"So there I was, unknowingly scaling the sometimes greasy, sometimes nasty, always treacherous mountain known as the pinnacle of Mexican Food in Phoenix. And when I finally trudged past the swill near the bottom, (you know who you are, Garcia's, Macayo's, etc) Past the others that were\"good\" but not memorable or noteworthy.

There you were, alone at the apex of my appetite of desire... Hello my jewel Rosita's.

Fresh traditional Mexican prepared fast and warm...

Like the menu claims \"Their specialty is good tasting food.\" I would swap good with great. And have a margarita too."}
{"text":"OMG. One of the top Mexican restaurants in Phx. I had ordered the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce which was amazing. The flavor and restaurant is as authentic as they come. Home made tortilla chips were served prior to my meal. Almost had to be rolled out of there after my meal 5/5 Stars"}
{"text":"Another great spot on the McDowell Mexican Food Expressway.  The other reviewers were dead-on and I appreciate the Yelp community for getting me prepped for waiting times.  I will agree and state that it is totally worth the wait - I had two enchiladas in red suace - one machaca and one pollo.  They were both excellent and I would highly recommend them to anyone.  It is slightly annoying that the chips have a cost, but seriously it's just a buck!  The salsa totally makes it worth it as well - I think the red salsa there is some of the best I've had in recent times.

The atmosphere was great.  There was a little cantina towards the back and the place was a lot bigger and nicer than I was expecting.

That pesky service is the only thing that keeps Rosita's from making the leap to great from good.  As I said, if you head in assuming things may take a while, not so bad; but I could see that becoming a problem in time-sensitive situations like lunch.

One last quick tip - they don't split the bill, so make sure people in your party have cash or owe money to the person who ends up paying with the card."}
{"text":"It was rainy & cloudy out today & I was craving something warm with a flour tortilla on the side of course. 

Ended up getting some eggs with steak & beans. My boyfriend got the shrimp soup. It took way too long for us to get our food but turns out they made the caldo to order. We were getting a little hangry but it was totally worth the wait for him. 
 That is the only reason why we gave it 3 stars. 
 We're definitely coming back & do recommend Rosita's Place."}
{"text":"Was super hungry and the family was feeling for mexican. 
Tried this place and it was the worst food ever. The taquitos were blan 
My combo plate had no taste 
Taco Bell is better than this place 

Save your money and go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service.  A somewhat hidden gem.   We had a group of 4 and we felt so welcome and enjoyed the perfectly made cocktails."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food made like my Mama & Nana did it! You can't get any closer to old school home cooked food unless Nana cooks it! Love their fresh chips. GREEN CORN TAMALES are Chicken MOLE is the Nest in Phx IMO. Service is good & beers always cold!"}
{"text":"The food is horrible!  Yelpers are normally right on and I rely on them when trying a new place. I personally rarely review restaurants but felt compelled to write one because I want others looking for good Mexican food to avoid this place. The staff was pleasant and accommodating but that could not make up for the bad tasting food!  I'm in town from Los Angeles, so not sure if the there is a regional difference in Mexican cooking but if you're used to good Mexican food in the likes of LA stay clear from this place. The beans were dry, the guacamole was made with cheap tasting avocados, the albondiga soup was tasteless and the chorizo and eggs plate was made with some type of meat that tasted nothing like chorizo. I feel bad writing this review but if you're in town and its past 9 pm on a weekday just go to Taco Bell ( never thought I'd say this!)
Oh and when we got the check we couldn't read the chicken scratch on it. As it turns out it was done on purpose as the waitress added her tip into the tab, but she never told us she did. Had we not asked the host to review the check we would have left her a double tip- tricky!!!"}
{"text":"Rosita's is alright. I wouldn't file it under authentic Mexican food, but I certainly wouldn't call it Americanized either. Their beginnings were likely with authentic ingredients and recipes, but over time, things change a bit. I would say the best thing at this restaurant isn't on the menu: chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here every Friday for about 6 years in a row. There is a period where they close down for a couple weeks to do house cleaning. But other than that I'm in. Their food is spicy. Service is \"as to be expected\".  Meaning this isn't a 5 star restaurant and they aren't being paid % star wages. I have no complaints. The food is delicious. I must have had everything on their menu. My go to though is the green chile burro enchilada style with green chile. I love their green salsa. Their tacos come with potatoes as part of the filling. It's something different for me, but it was a welcome addition. 

I would definitely recommend this place for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy gives me love in my tummy. I love this place, I've been coming here since I was a kid. Saturday's and Sunday's we come for the menudo and the fixings. They also have plenty to choose from. I opted for breakfast this time around. The beans are quite delectable and you get a fresh corn or flour tortilla on the side. This place is very family oriented and gives the vibe that you're eating with close ones. I highly recommend, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"How have I driven by this place so many times? I never knew such good food awaited me inside this little shop as I drove by.
Wow, when my girlfriend was really sick a few weeks ago her close friend took us Rositas for some spicey healing food.
Chips and salsa were really good. Fresh hot chips,that they make right there in store.
Along with 2 delish salsas.
We got the best Chicken soup I have ever had in my life. Yes, better than my Mothers. But, do not tell her. I don't want to hurt her feelings.

Each of our soups had a full chicken breast inside. The broth was amazing.
Our meal was amazing and more than I could eat. 
By that night my girlfriend felt like a new person, it really was the healing food.
Recently I stopped in a little short of time and got an order to go.
Again fantastic ,hot ,delish food.
The ladies that work there are so sweet as well!
This is so good and so inexspensive as well. I sort of hate to share my new find,because, it will get really busy and I won't find a seat. 
But you will love this place."}
{"text":"This is a go-to if we are in the area.  Yes, I know its in a sketchy part of town but I have never had problems there.  Parking is in the back and there is plenty of it.  The restaurant is cozy with a coy pond in the middle!  The chips and salsa are amazing.  I've ordered tacos, burritos and enchiladas and they have never disappointed.  But my fav there is the soups!  Chicken soup with a thigh of chicken and big chunks of veggies, the albondigas is amazing too!  Of course you can never go wrong with menudo!  Service can sometimes be slow but you know, its all about enjoying the company you are with and good food!"}
{"text":"I love the food but the customer service sucks.  I would leave right now if I wasn't that hungryand didn't want to wait at another restaurant.  Smh"}
{"text":"Pros:  Chips, salsas, beans, green chili, BIG tacos, great prices/value.

Cons:  Ground beef was mush, rice was meh.

Bottom line:    In my longstanding quest to find a go-to Mexican joint in central Phoenix, Rosita's emerges as a leading contender.   

The chips are made fresh to order ($1 for a big basket) and go great with the salsas, and even better with a side of beans.  About the beans:  they're as good as advertised, with a salty/creamy (but not textureless) combo that's bliss.  Too bad the rice was so ordinary and bland.  But no one has big expectations for Mexican style rice, so only a small knock here.

The green chili burro ($5, additional $3 for beans and rice) is top notch, near Rito's in quality, but with a better construction.  Tender and spicy and not too soupy to soak through the tortilla.  Generous portion, too. 

For kicks I also ordered a crunchy taco with ground beef and potato.  On the good side, it was BIG for $2.60, and full of goodies, lots of cheese and a good but not excessive helping of lettuce.  Good value.  On the downside, the flavor and texture were very disappointing.  They blended the beef and potatoes together to make it a pasty mix.  Not appetizing at all.

My friend got a chicken taco and enchilada and said the chicken was particularly flavorful and tasted like it was braised, which is uncommon in a town where most Mexican places boil and shred their chicken.

The atmosphere inside is perfectly respectable for this kind of restaurant.  The neighborhood isn't great, but it's a well lit parking lot and there's an attendant watching the premises and the parking lot.  So there's that."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Great service. Ground beef taco and green enchiladas delicious. Chips are served hot and the green sauce is the best ever. Best Mexican food and service ever."}
{"text":"I love Rosita's! They have excellent Mexican food at a really reasonable price. 
The environment is casual and the service average. The delicious plates and portions are the reason I gave it such a high rating. I live in the far east valley and travel to Phoenix to eat at Rosita's at least once a month."}
{"text":"You live around east central Phoenix, you should already know all about Rosita's. But in case you don't,  and for anybody else, here's the deal: this is the place you go to when you want a fun atmosphere, authentic Mexican food and enough of it to knock you stupid for about 5 hours. I live down the street from Rosita's, and there are more great Mexican food spots around here than I can count on all four hands. A lot of them can have you in and out with a great meal to go in no time, which is great for me because I generally don't like being around too many people when I eat. But I absolutely LOVE eating at Rosita's. Something about the awesome decor, the diverse clientele, the amazing food, and the servers who are either sweet as candy or surly with hearts of gold. It all comes together in a perfect package, and I keep coming back to eat there even when it might be easier to get something on the go. 
Recommendations: chicken mole, mixed plate, carnitas plate. Also everything else."}
{"text":"I am updating my previous review. You know it's great how the service has changed! It use to be that I would only go to Rosita once a year because I didn't care for the service over the years. Since then I have been back on a number of occasions and the service was great! The food was always great and now the service matches! My rating would be 5 stars for food always, and now 5 stars for service! It's a great place to be!"}
{"text":"I have never driven so far across Phoenix in rush hour traffic, 45 mins, through 2 accidents to eat anywhere like I will Rosita's! The energetic atmosphere, amazing company, awesome margueritas, the food. Tonight I had the Chicken Enchilada with red sauce ~ a most amazing dish ~ with beans. My friends always order the same tried and true - \"Green and Green Chile Burro\" straight up. Always the best prices. Oh, but dont forget what inspires us to begin this quest - this mission in the first place: her name is Reyna. She is the most gracious and beautifully humble Lady I have ever been Blessed to meet. She always makes great recommendations, but always remembers our order, every time. She brings Rosita's something extra ~ but find out for yourself...Just ask for Reyna (love the way she winks)"}
{"text":"Great place to get quality Mexican food. The red sauce is a little hot but good and full of flavor. They do not skimp on the cheese in the quesadilla. The shredded beef tacos with rice and beans were hearty and delicious. Excellent chips."}
{"text":"Truly the best Mexican food in the Valley of the Sun.  They are a great family that have carried their delicious tradition of serving spicy, flavorful and comforting dishes for generations..."}
{"text":"It has been about a year since I last visited this place, but I subscribe to their Facebook page and always see their updated posts and photos.  I used to be a taxi driver in Phoenix, and I would go here after working nights to take a break, either to have breakfast or brunch.

First off, let me say that they have the best menudo in Phoenix, either red or white, and it is available every day, whereas most Mexican places will only have it available on weekends.  The menudo actually tastes homemade, not like it was just poured out of a can and reheated.  As far as the rest of their dishes, they also have a variety of tasty platters, such as different kinds of tacos, enchiladas, and \"burros\" (not burritos.... but the actual correct term of a big Mexican wrap; the term \"giant\" or \"big\" burrito is actually a contradiction or an oxymoron, but anyway I digress... back to the review!).  They also have chips and salsa, both the red and green variety.

The food is actually tasty and flavorful, unlike many of the other \"-berto's\" fast food Mexican places all around town, which for the most part, is bland and all tastes the same. Sure, it might be a bit unfair for me to make that comparison, since Rosita's is a restaurant and not a fast food joint.  And I'm not saying Filiberto's or Julioberto's or any of those other place are bad.  But what I'm saying is that I am willing to drive far just to eat out here at Rosita's, which is what the difference is.

This place can get crowded on a Sunday, so as usual, plan accordingly."}
{"text":"No further explain is needed. This place is THE authentic Mexican restaurant. I felt like having a nice dinner in Mexico. The mole sauce was the best!!!! Menudo was unbelievable. Every single item I got in this restaurant was beyond my expectation. I wish I tried the Mexican bread pudding but after eating all the food I was too full. The salsa sauces are extremely hot! Flan was tasty. I wish they open another location in Boston."}
{"text":"Since my last visit here,  all I have done is dream about the Red Chile Chimichanga!!!! It was so good!  If you go with more than one person,  stop at the ATM because they do not split checks,  don't be caught off guard like I was,  I no other complaints about this place."}
{"text":"Their chips and salsas are excellent and very spicy.  I always get the same thing on the menu... it is a combination plate with a beef taco and cheese enchilada.  The beef taco is yummy... I think they mix potato in with the beef.  I really like this combo although some people do not.  Everyone I have brought here absolutely loves it.  I told my mom about this place because (she is a local restaurateur) and she loves this place too.  That is saying a lot coming from her:)"}
{"text":"Alright so of course I have been coming here for years and have started checking in every time I come or we'll when I remember. Everything here is pretty good, fresh and tasty! My usual is Albondiga soup but I have tried enchiladas, carne Asada, chicken mole and much more. Let's just say everything is good here. 

It's small inside so if it's busy expect a wait. But it's worth it! The bar is in the back but it's small. The chips and Salsa are fresh and warm! Coffee is good too. 

If your in town or near by try this place out. It's really good and brings you back to Nana's cooking."}
{"text":"I came in on a weekday evening and was surprised to see menudo available, as most places only serve it on Saturdays! I ordered the menudo roja with pata (pig's feet) extra. The soup came out hot with a generous amount of tripe and hominy. It was initially not as spicy as I expected but that was easily remedied with provided spices, limes, cilantro, and chopped onions. Service is excellent with friendly and prompt wait staff. The chips and salsa are served fresh. They serve Pepsi products at this restaurant. Will certainly come back next time I am in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this after a fantastic day bowling...the neighborhood may seem sketchy but be a risk taker! Once inside, this place will leave you speechless. Where else do you get salty, spicy hot, cool, and crunch in one seating? The peach margarita definitely will make AZ's hot temps bearable without sacrificing the alcohol content like most frozen drinks. Besides, the more you have their homemade chips and salsa, you would want a pitcher of that concoction. The carnitas were different than I expected; partly because I didn't realize I would get a hunk of meat to configure my own burrito! The machaca was hands down the center stager of oohhaahh! And not to mention, I wanted to steal our service - happy, fun and all about making us happy!"}
{"text":"I got the beef machaca burro enchilada style.  The prices are pretty cheap which is nice, but I'm not sure it's worth the calories.  The meat inside my burro was burnt on some pieces so every bite had a strand or two of \"jerky\".  The flavor isn't terrible but how do you mess up tortilla and enchilada sauce right?  The burnt meat really cut into the enjoyment of my meal but also some pico de gallo or even just some onions/green onions would be nice to cut the heaviness of the dish."}
{"text":"I love this place but hate that I have to wait on my pick up even longer when I get there. They tell me 20 mins and I give them 25-30 minute and I'm still waiting for my food when I get there. Delicious menudo especially because they give more meat than homney but I would like it to go on time please."}
{"text":"Not good. My husband ordered food to-go. 2 of the 3 meals we got were wrong. The one that was correct was mine, chicken mole. It was not good. Every bite of the chicken had bone, so more than likely a piece of cheap back meat. The beans had a nice creamy consistency, which is the only reason for the one star I am giving them. The carnitas burrito, which should have been carne asada, was a tortilla filled with pork covered with enchilada sauce. Dry meat in a tortilla does not a burrito make!! The other order was supposed to be mole enchiladas instead we got a cheese enchilada and bean tacos. The shells were broken. 
This was a disappointing experience over all."}
{"text":"Yum: perfect homemade beans, ranchero breakfasts, tacos, tortillas, chicken mole, and menudo. Homemade chips and original spicy salsa. Folks, there is SO much to love at this consistent, satisfying restaurant. I've been known to do take out for evening cravings...Service is friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Had a Manudo with a knee of a pork. It was tasty, rich with ingredients, and good amount. Expected a bit different feeling with the knee, but was pleased. real pansita in Mexico is a bit more tasty. Here they also serve it with lemon not lime. 
The salsas they make: the green one - really good, the red one is precooked and a bit too mild. 
Michelada was great! 
Tried also a piece from combo, normal enchiladas and clasic tostadas. They had great red salsa with it, but otherwise pretty mild in taste."}
{"text":"Legit AZ Mexican food with a great cheese crisp. This was our last meal in Phoenix during a conference and family weekend. Thoroughly enjoyed this place. The guacamole, chips and salsa were great. My sister had a tostada - very good. Her daughter-in-law had tamales, which she loved, but they were SPICY!!! Staff was very nice."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best Mexican food restaurants in the valley. I will now go out of my way to visit this place every chance I get. This is tradition real Mexican food, not the Americanized versions you get in most place. Bring your appetite because the portions are big."}
{"text":"Went for the menudo. The best part about it was the freshness and cleanliness of the dish. However, the serving was barely enough. Other menudo specialty restaurants serve a bottomless bowl for 50 cents less and it's usually as good or better tasting..
The service at Rosita's is the worst. When we arrived it took a few minutes for the waitress to arrive. She brought 2 forks, 1 knife and chips and salsa. No water.  She left and returned about 7 minutes later with pad and pen in hand. She asked us what we wanted to drink and my daughter ordered a soft drink and I ordered a Chelada.  I also asked for waters.  She asked my daughter what she wanted to order. My daughter asked me if we are ready and the waitress told my daughter \"You order now.\"  We ordered.  Several minutes later we got our drinks and 1 glass of water.  The Chelada tasted more like a Bloody Mary and I only drank 1/2.  
The food arrived and our order was right. My daughter had a beef Chimichanga with rice and beans. Over priced at $12 but the flavors were outstanding. Especially the beans and rice.  As mentioned earlier, the Menudo was fantastic but the portion left me wanting more.
As we were eating I called across the room for an order of Pozole to go.  My waitress replied from across the room \"Let me check.\"  She did not ask me if I wanted red or white, beef or pork, and flour or corn tortillas.  Yet when she brought me the to go bag I asked if it was red and if she included flour tortilla.  She replied they only sell red and she put flour tortilla as I had requested. Again I hadn't been offered a choice.  When my wife ate the Pozole she discovered the tortillas were corn. Also, the Pozole had only 2 pieces of meat and the hominy was hard.
Finally, the check was scibbled and illegible. I was charged $40.65 for 2 bowls of basically soup,  a fried burrito with beans and rice, and a beer and soda.
I wouldn't mind paying $40 if the Pozole had been as good as the Menudo.  They'd have a better chance of my return business or recommendation to others if portions were larger. I had a difficult time tipping as much as 10% for the horrible service that came with bottomless bowl of attitude."}
{"text":"Rosita's is one of those places that you go to eat authentic Mexican food and never leave disappointed! The servers are super nice and make you feel right at home. The food is so delicious. You can't go wrong with anything you pick here. I got the carne asada chimichanga combo with rice and beans and it was HUGE. They don't skimp on their portions here at all. I could've easily shared this with my wife and been satisfied. The prices are awesome as well. The only thing I find odd is that they charge you for the usual complimentary chips and salsa that you would get at any other Mexican place you go to. They don't tell you that either. I realized it when I got my bill and asked what I was charged $3.99 for."}
{"text":"The biggest and best chimichanga I have ever eaten. Great food at a great price! This place gets packed fast. I can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"Because of the reviews we decided to check this place out. We had to wait a bit long, in my opinion, to order. 

Guacamole had no taste, I added lemon, salt, and pepper for taste. 
The salsa was okay. 

The food I ordered had no flavor and it was extremely dry. I added lemon, guac, salt, and lots of salsa to my burrito and even then I was finsing it hard to swallow the dry meat. 

The portions were great especially for the prices. Unfortunately was missing flavor. And may I also add, the food is authentic to an extent. Yeah they have some actual Mexican dishes but they're not that authentic. Lots of their dishes are paired up with french fries. 

Wish I could of tried some of their drinks but seemed all they had were beers at the time. 

I don't think I'd eat here again. I am new to Phoenix so I am going to explore other options."}
{"text":"I went to Rosita's for lunch with a large group of coworkers. After hearing the praises sung about this place, I was ready to have \"real\" Mexican food (by my coworkers' definitions). 

The location is small and not particularly tidy, but was seemed to be pretty legitimate, and we were happy to take the trip over.We started out with chips and salsa, red and green. The green was HOT, while the red was more mild, but they were both very flavorful. Our group of about 12 people was waited on by one woman, who did her best, but definitely could have used some help on a party that large.

We started with cheese crisp, which was new to me, and delicious! The cheese was hot and evenly melted, with a rich, buttery flavor. I added a little red salsa to give it a kick, and really enjoyed it!

We waited a LONG time to get our entrees (I would guess 45 minutes from the time the crisp was delivered), and I was accidentally given the wrong entree. I'd ordered a chicken burro, enchilada style, with rice, and received my boss' order of the same thing, but with beef. After cutting into it, I passed it to him and let the waitress know what I had ordered and that I hadn't received my food. 10 minutes later, she returned to our table with another burro (the one pictured) that was okay, but tasted a bit off... after examining it, I realized that it was pork... which I don't really care for. Not wanting to slow down an already-long lunch, I decided to just go ahead and eat the second burro, despite my not really caring for the meat. 

All in all, I might be willing to give it another try, but the wait and receiving the wrong food twice were fairly off-putting. It would likely have been a better experience, had our table had an extra waitress, as my drink also sat empty for about a quarter of the meal with no server in sight. My fingers are crossed that next time, the experience is better. I was really looking forward to the meal, and it just didn't come out as good as I'd hoped it might."}
{"text":"Rosita's Place is a Phoenix institution. Everyone who's anyone eats here, from former governor Bruce Babbitt to nobodies like me. My father used to tease me that I was \"born with a spoon of Rosita's refried beans in my mouth;\" I have been eating here for 40 years, and the waitress I remember from my childhood still works here.

From their humble beginnings on Buckeye road to their \"new\" (they've been here quite awhile) location on McDowell Rd near 24th street, the owners of this restaurant have won more accolades for delicious home-cooked Mexican food than anywhere else in the Valley of the Sun. The huge portions of food are cheap and consistently delicious, based on family recipes. You're likely to encounter a live mariachi band on weekends. 

The red sauce is hotter than the green, but not by much - they'll both smoke your brains out of your skull. Everything is good. Keep returning until you've tried all of it. My favorites: chile relleno with rice, beans & flour tortilla, albondigas soup, carnitas plate, and the refried beans in general.

Maybe it's because I've been dining at Rosita's Place regularly for my whole life, and they know me, but I never get slow service as has been mentioned in other reviews. Also, if you think this place is in the ghetto, and you don't like that you have to park in back where you can't see your car while you eat, you're too sheltered - in case you didn't notice, there is always a paid attendant keeping an eye on the parking lot!"}
{"text":"I won't say much as there are enough reviews already to give you a pretty good idea of the place.  One thing I didn't see mentioned too much was that compared to a lot of  mainstream mex restaurants this place generally has  much spicier food and salsa.  So if you don't like your mex food \"hot\" this may not be the place for you.  It's not overdone hot like a few places but definitely a step up from mainstream.  At least ask when you order how hot the particular dish might be.  Their salsa is way hotter than most places.  I have taken out of town guests here and it's been too hot for several of them."}
{"text":"#2 Rosita's is another place that is always busy! Rosita has great fresh tortilla chips and salsa, a mole that is to die for and a chili relleno that has to be the best in town. The atmosphere is so so and the crowd is not as friendly.. Service is good and the food is affordable like it should be! Stiff Margs too!"}
{"text":"I love love love rosita's!! Been here several times Never been disappointed...the red sauce cheese enchiladas are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Family favorite literally grew up eating machaca chimi! Best chips salsa and margaritas"}
{"text":"I went here again yesterday.  The food as usual is very good.  The chips are right out of the oven (fryer.....where ever they come from) and are fresh.  My three year old son was with me.  He got a kick out of the koi pond in the front of the restaurant.  I normally do not associate koi with Mexican restaurants........

The food was delicious.  I had the chicken mole enchiladas which were made just right.  The guacamole was as fresh as it comes. 

The ambiance matched the atmosphere.  In addition, a designated parking area in the back.

My only concern was the lack of service in general."}
{"text":"For my money one of two or three best Mexican restaurants in the valley. Work downtown eat lunch out 5 days a week. Always go here at least once a week. Some of the best green and red chili I have ever had. Also great beans made with bacon grease. Also has menudo and posole which are wonderful. Try this joint do not let the appearance or location scare you a way."}
{"text":"Excellent, fast service. Staff knows it's food and it's plated well, taste is lacking some cilantro and spice but overall this place is great"}
{"text":"This place is always amazing best Mexican food Phoenix!  Homemade everything!  Chips are cooked fresh and are hot and crispy - both red and green salsa.  Absolutely delish!!  Micheladas - authentic homemade Mexican food and awesome drinks and friendly family environment!!"}
{"text":"I came here a few months back and the food was really good. I came again today and that was not the case. The food was oily and the service sucked. Our waitress barely even spoke to us and it took her 20min to bring us out check after she glanced at us when we were done. She seemed super unenthusiastic to be at her job and definitely took it out on us. I don't think ill be back."}
{"text":"After hours upon hours (jk) of reviewing potential places to have a delicious authentic Mexican meal, we decided on this place. We were visiting from Philly and couldn't leave Phoenix without eating the real deal, forget Taco Bell (ha ha I know that's not real food, ijs!)
Anyway what a beautiful culinary experience! The food was fresh and piping hot and FAST! I only ate about 3 chips looked up and my dinner was there! Huge portions, pretty food, reasonably priced, nice ambience, service a little curt but who cares, I'm an East Coast gal anyway so I'm used to it!"}
{"text":"I had a chicken burrito enchilada style with mole sauce. It was absolutely huge and delicious. I also got the rice and beans with it and the refried beans were literally the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"First impression walking in was definitely how clean it was. The food was good and didn't taste like every other Mexican food restaurant out there but had a more authentic taste to it. The drinks were really good too. The service was not the best but it wasn't bad. I recommend trying this restaurant at least once to form your own opinion."}
{"text":"Rostias Place is the best Mexican food place in Phoenix.  They have amazing machaca and the salsa's are always great.  Sometime's the salsa's and chile are so hot I fear my stomach might explode, but in a good way. It doesn't get any better than Rosita's."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were really good, but beware the chips cost $1. Not a big deal, they make them fresh to order too. I had been looking forward to trying Rositas for a long time based on the Yelp reviews. My mom ordered the chicken enchiladas and I ordered the machaca chimi both came with rice and beans. My mom enjoyed the enchiladas, and I thought the chimi was okay...nothing spectacular. About halfway through our meal, a baby cockroach crawled across the table. We both lost our appetite and asked for the check. I got my food to go, but just couldn't bring myself to finish it. Definitely disappointed.."}
{"text":"Good food, service, and plenty of food. It was recommended to another guy and it did not fail to appease the taste buds. If your in Phoenix, make a stop. Parking is kind of a pain but you'll get past that after eating the food."}
{"text":"Don't let the seedy location fool ya, this place is the bomb, serving up some of the most authentic Mexican I've ever tasted.

Your experience will begin with parking in the rear of the place. As you make the long walk to the front entrance, you'll disregard any conversation with others in your party as you worry whether or not your car will be there after dinner. It will and here's why.

As you make your way to the front of the parking lot, you'll notice an old Mexican man, (actually a cliche or sorts, complete with sombrero and serape) sitting, vigilantly keeping an eye on your vehicle and everyone else's. 
This should calm you down, enough so that you're able to re-join the conversation. Now get inside and get ready for a cold Mexican beer and a pitcher of Margaritas. 

Their chips are gratis and served warm. A nice treat,. They offer red salsa, hot sauce, and tomatillo green sauce which is spectacularly hot.

Every item on their menu is delicious, but my preference is either the Machaca burrito, or the Chicken Mole. Their mole sauce is off the charts good. Not too much chocolate, not too much chile, just right. 

What I really love is the black and white photos of old Mexican bandits, governors, rabble rousers, war hero, ex-Presidents and others. 

Here's my suggestion.
Go on a weeknight when they're not busy. In this way, you can make your way around the room and get a close up look at the images, which in my opinion are worth a look,.

The food, ambiance, service are all superb. 
This is the place where I take out-of towner's when they say they want 'real' Mexican food. 
This is also the place where your butt-hole will curse you the next day if you don't listen to him and ease up on the salsa."}
{"text":"Best Mexican meal we could have asked for! We stopped for our first meal in Phoenix and loved it. It was authentic, tasty and had a great vibe. Would 100% recommend to anyone in the area!!"}
{"text":"If you want REALLY authentic and flavorful Mexican food, please come here! The prices are very reasonable for the healthy portions of deliciousness that you will encounter. They have an extensive menu which included mole and also menudo on a regular basis, I believe. They also have good beer and michelada prices for individuals (by the glass) or for groups (pitchers)."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for, which is not much here. The chips and salsa was great, but the entree (tacos and chimichanga) was dry and flavorless."}
{"text":"Mexican Food Done Right


My co-worker and I decided we wanted authentic Mexican food for lunch and after reading reviews for Rosita's we headed down to 24th Street and McDowell for lunch.

Rosita's isn't one of those typical  fancy chain \"Mexican Gourmet\" restaurants.  Rosita's is the real deal and the folks at Rosita's are doing \"Mexican Food\" up right.

As we entered the restaurant we sat ourselves at a table.  Our server took our drink order and brought us a huge basket  of chips and salsa.  The chips at Rosita's are made fresh to order and served sizzling hot. These chips are thin, crispy, lightly salted, and absolutely delicious. I could have easily ate the entire basket but needed to save room for our lunch entr√©e's. 

Usually when I dine at a Mexican Restaurant  I order a machaca burrito enchilada style, so there is no telling how many machaca burritos enchilada style  I've earen over the years. So, today was no diffrent. I had the machaca beef burrito enchilada style and it was delicious. One of the best machaca burritos I've even eaten.

The machaca was moist, tender, and full of flavor.   My tastebuds were in heaven. Not only was my burrito delicious,  the serving was large, and I mean very large.  I couldn't even finish half my burrito. 

 Everything we tried was unbelievably tasty. From the  machaca burrito, chicken mole, green chili tamale, to the guacamole & beans each dish was absolutely delicious.

If your ever in the area, stop by Rosita's you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food and is really good here. I hope you enjoy your time here at Rosita's Place trust me you will like it"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Phoenix. Very authentic. Casual vibe. The house salsa is so hot my nose was burning (I typically can drink most salsas like water- it packs a true punch). Machaca chimichanga was the best I have ever had. Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"BEST place to dine in for menudo, love the pozole as well (only seasonal item). Still cannot get over them not offering bread(bolillo) with your menudo, don't know any other place that doesn't have bread but I've learned to get over it a little and just order a flour tortilla. Also, if you love A LOT of lemon on your menudo I suggest you bring your own small bottle of lemon juice, the wedges they offer are super small and you get very little lemon and a lot of mess from trying to squeeze every last drop. Oh, and the salsa that they serve with chips is REALLY hot and sometimes inedable for my taste. Other than that, you learn to live with the above in lieu of good mexican food, definitely my second favorite place for authenic dine in mexican food and first favorite for menudo. Large menu selection and everything is good. I suggest you come as soon as they open to avoid long waiting times because the dining area is a bit small and cramped. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The service was good. I had a red chili con carne burrito, enchilada style. There was A LOT of  sauce and the beef was tough.  The chips and salsa were great.  I would probably give this place one more chance, just order something different when I go the next time."}
{"text":"So good! Everything was great from the red and green salsas brought out with chips, to the huge margaritas. I had a combo plate with a cheese enchilada, bean tostada and a ground beef taco. It came with rice and beans and was still under $10! My boyfriend had the tamale combo, and the maza was perfect! The real takeaway here was the tortillas. The chips,  taco/tostada shells, and the enchilada tortilla were hands down my favorite parts of the meal. Like I mentioned, the margaritas are giant and so tasty! Perfect balance of sweet, tart, and salty. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I do not know what is the big deal about this place, it seems to be very popular. 
First, the parking is way in the back and the exit is very narrow.
I have been here a few times and I never got a warm and fuzzy feeling. Like service is OK but not actually friendly. A couple other visits were solid 3 stars, our last one was one star... or zero if I could. So in the interest of averages, I will give 2 stars on this review.
So we got there, were told to wait to be seated.
After like 3 minutes we got a table.
After like 3 minutes we got chips and salsa...
Chips were over done, tasted a little close to burned. We tried to get new chips and nothing.
We waited for someone to take our beverage order and nothing...
A party was seated behind me and they got service right away.
The hostess stopped nearby to seat another party, I asked if we had a server because no one had stopped by.
...
Time went by.
....
We got up and left and went to La Barquita (just a few blocks away), and had really good soup for dinner (2 caldo de res, and one chicken soup)."}
{"text":"This is my husband's and my all-time favorite Mexican restaurant. You have to like spicy salsa though because they only have spicy green and spicy red salsa. Both are good if you can stand the heat! The chips are good: thin and hot (although you might have a few greasy ones at the bottom of the basket). I've never had better green corn tamales or refried beans than I can get here. My husband likes the egg burro with green sauce all over it. Yum, yum, yum!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks yelpers, following advice of others is not always good.  This place was a big let down. I was excited for a minute when I saw a full parking lot and small crowd inside but once the food arrived all I can do is smh.  The horchata was decent but that was the only positive about this meal unfortunately. The service was also non existent, not attentive or nice at all which made the experience even worse.  We did get tortilla chips but the salsa was so fricken spicy none of us could eat it, what a waste. The kids ordered tacos that were inedible, we ordered a soft taco but got a hard one instead and the other kid ordered fish tacos that were so spicy he couldn't eat them at all.  And the waitress took the order directly from them so how do you screw those up, kids would not eat their tacos, does that make any sense?  How hard is it to screw up a taco?  Me and my other companion both ordered chicken chimichangas that were crunchy and delish looking on the outside but one bite and We were both disgusted. All dark meat, no flavor, super dry and unseasoned meat, no kind of sauce inside or out, cheese not even melted on top. I will say that the avocado thrown on the side was good but unfortunately it didn't make up for the bad meal. The beans are cooked in lard with no vegetarian alternative so all you vegans don't bother coming here. Anyways, first time leaving a restaurant with full plates that none of us finished or taken home as left overs. And sell hungry but will opt out of Yelp for dinner tonight. Still fuming over such a dreadful lunch."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for Mexican food in the valley. I've been going there for years specifically for the white menudo. Their ground beef/potato tacos are incredible and I love that some of the servers have been there the entire time I have been going."}
{"text":"Don't let the look scare you away! The chips were amazing, fresh made and still warm. The food was so yummy, really good authentic mexican food. Must try the enchiladas."}
{"text":"omg, I have been away from hot food too long. the heat from the basic jalape√±os and green chile's set my tongue on fire. Gringo mouth...
the chips and salsa were warm and crispy. we both ordered the green tamale combo. I've never had the tamales like they make them...there is some kind of baked cheese thing in there. I thought it was a hot dog! it was ok, not my favorite. the side of rice and beans was great but so much food.
I felt very authentic. and price point was good for the amount of food."}
{"text":"I've been to rositas a few times now and I must say that not only is the food delicious but their prices are unbeatable. Even though they have a small fee for chips and salsa, I always have to get them because they come out so hot and fresh and their salsas have the perfect spice level. I have ordered the mixed red and green chili plate each time because it's so flavorful and filling. Enchiladas are also amazing, probably some of the best in Phoenix. Haven't tried dessert so I can't speak to the that, but your going to be so full from the entrees that you probably can't even think of dessert. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good solid mexican food.  Big portions and small prices.  If you order a burrito or chimi get it wet, I made that mistake only once!"}
{"text":"This is not one of my favorite food wasn't tasty salsa had no flavor pretty blend I wouldn't come back"}
{"text":"Visiting from California and the food
was amazing! However, the looks from waitress were very unpleasant... ordered a michelada 
draft but what I received was large 
glass of ice that looked like iced tea !!!
Who puts ice in a draft beer?? Just
a suggestion, for a Popular business, I 
 Recommend it Wouldn't hurt to offer 
customer if they would like a bottle. Instead of asking if they could fix it for me, the waitress asked if I would like more water?? Last time I checked beer was not water!!"}
{"text":"Rosita's is our family's favorite and must-go-to place whenever we are visiting in AZ. Their chips are served piping hot and just about everything we order is oh so good! My favorite is the chicken enchilada plate with mole sauce."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm updating my review. I was pretty upset with Rosita's for my experience with them through take out orders. This review is based on my first time dining in. 

The food is delicious. No one has better white menudo or frijoles (refried beans)."}
{"text":"Cute cozy restaurant with a good atmosphere. They had a cute little pond with fish that gave it that unique touch. I came here for the menudo because I've heard it has the best. It was really tasty not as spicy which is perfect. I had a corona michelada because they were out of xx :/ , but let me tell you it was the best michelada I've had in months even better than the ones I make! I also ordered a cheese enchilada just to try, but I wanted a green one and got a red one :/. It was still good, but I've never been a fan of red so it's hard for me to judge it. My friend ordered a lemonade and I had a taste and it was delicious she thought it was a bit sour though. They also offered us salsa and chips and we of course said yes. The chips were warm so I can tell they made them there they were delish! The salsas were a little bland and lacked some seasoning. 

On a side note we were seated on a booth and it was super tight I did not have much room so maybe they should spread out their seating or next time I will not sit at a booth."}
{"text":"Rosita's is THE mexican food restaurant when you're near the 10/51 interchange. Everything is great -- the food, the atmosphere, the service. The salsa is excellent but watch out for the verde, that stuff gets caliente. Fortunately their glasses of water are plenty large.

Tie for favorite items are the shrimp chili rellano plate and the two ground beef and potato tacos. The taco shells, like the chips, are freshly prepared and topped to the brim with lettuce and cheese. Just a very legit mexican dining experience."}
{"text":"I could have rated this place \"0\" stars but you don't offer it..
I hardly ever take the time to rate a place, but this restaurant,  the public should be warn..
I was there last night wit my wife, we got the chips and they looked and felt like they just came out of bucket of oil, salsa was ok. My wife orderd the the Mexican platter, asked for NO cheese,  she got it WITH  cheese, and the meat was as chewy as if you chewed on your shoe sole.. i order the machaca chimmichanga,  WITH rice and beans, got no rice and beans,  again,  the meat thought flavorful,  was very tough.
To add insult to injury,  the waitress was very rude,  didn't show up to ask if all okay,  totally ignoring us and turned her back to us just so she can ignore our gestures to capture her attention.
I love authentic foods and wanted to experience food other then Mexica American style restaurant, but Rositas's 
Place was one of the worst."}
{"text":"Came for lunch, will never return, the presentation was sloppy, the waitress was rude, what a waste of time and money the mole enchiladas were not only disgusting but looked like a plate of slop with rice and beans! Left with a stomach ache and a bad taste in my mouth.."}
{"text":"exceptional customer service!!!  The cashier was very patient and friendly as well ! great menudo!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for several years, and probably always will come back. The food is wonderful with large portions, definitely going to have left overs. Slight complaint, they are always very busy, and with the place being small it can get pretty loud and tight. Also, a lot of the staff are hard to understand, the language barrier is noticeable. Worth the drive to try it out, I highly recommend it, just get there before you're starving in case there is a line!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Down home. Nothing fancy. Real deal Phoenix. I get the red burro enchilada style. Chips are hot and fresh. Good green salsa."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great portions, and the salsa is perfect if you have tolerance. The burritos are huge, and the meats have been cooked just right in y experiences.

As far as service goes, it can be a hit or miss. The same server has been there in a timely manner to take out order, and another time, she did not seem to return for 15 minutes and had to ask another server for assistance. They will disappear after taking your order. 

50/50 shot of them having orchata. What kind of Mexican food place run out of the Mexican marquee drink?!

Would return if I'm in the area with set expectations."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 4 stars the food is just really good. Every time I have gone to this restaurant it was delicious however it is very old and even the tables do not match you would not want to bring a large group of people because there is really only a few tables for large groups however there is also some nostalgia to the place because it is so old other than that it's definitely worth 4 stars and worth trying because of the food"}
{"text":"Excellent service matched only by how good the food was.  Priced correctly with a very large portion."}
{"text":"Me and the wifey came to have breakfast early Saturday morning.....was craving menudo....so I ordered menudo n the wifey the flautas plate. The waitress who attended us was very sweet n friendly.she took our order n brought us or drinks (large glasses which I like) another lady brought us chips n salsa.....chips were piping hot!!! There was a green n red salsa...I liked the the red better. 
My menudo was delicious just wish they had pata that day...ordered a small refried beans with cheese,  yummy!!!! All the condiments for the menudo was brought n available..
Wifeys Flauta plate looked delicioso!!! She loved it..
Gonna come back n try other menu items soon.
Over all food was delicious...service was awsome n friendly...and the price was great!!!"}
{"text":"If you want authentic mexican food this is your spot!! Must try! Super busy on Sunday's"}
{"text":"The Mr. and I have been on the hunt lately for the the best menudo and posole in Maricopa County. I wouldn't say they're the best, but both are delicious here. Portion sizes are large but you can order the 1/2 size  for the menudo. The posole had a rich chicken broth flavor, a good amount of hominy, and had a big chunk of beef spine. The menudo was good. It had a good ratio of hominy to broth and plenty of tripe.  Their was too much \"stuff\" and not enough broth. I especially liked that they bring you plenty of fixings with your order. The horchata was good but had a little too much cinnamon for my liking. The service was good and the restaurant was clean. Overall, I'd come back!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to say there are alot of Mexican restaraunts in the valley. I believe that has been mentioned before. I ended up at Rosita's Place because a co-worker was meeting someone there. I doubt I would have dropped in on my own. Upon walking in, I was turned off by their signs about what they will not do. They will not split the check. They charge for the chips. I was prepared for a bad experience.

Rosita's Place is now on my \"A\" lunch circuit. I agree that the service was not world class, but the portions were generous and the food was delicious. As seen on other reviews for Rosita's, both the green and red salsas packed a heck of a kick. Unfettered, I ordered the Camarones a Diablo (Devil's Shrimp). It came after a longer than average wait, and it was a spicy, tasty meal. The chips came out very hot and fresh, and my lunch partners dishes looked equally appetizing.

Give Rosita's Place a shot, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Great environment, the little Nanas are simply adorable as servers, food is actually pretty good too. This is my 2nd visit here and what SUBTRACTS significantly on what could be a GREAT EXPERIENCE, is the waiting & frustration that you sense from Restaurant  Management because they are not efficiently managing traffic -EVEN- when there's very little to no traffic."}
{"text":"The food was great and I would go back for this reason alone.  The service was not good. The waitress was grouchy and we tried to be friendly but she wasn't buying it.  She wasn't accommodating to our friend that was with us, who only wanted carne asada by itself not on a tortilla.  The request shouldn't have been a big deal but the waitress would not offer any alternatives.  I felt like I was bothering her, as if we interrupted her break to order food. 
The burros and salsa were fantastic, if you can deal with the rudeness and long wait then I would recommend this place otherwise order take-out."}
{"text":"Rosita's Place is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants...all the classic dishes, huge portions, great margaritas, colorfully painted and decorated inside. Friendly fast service! Try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Man... my tio's and tia had been coming here for YEARS!! Almost every Sunday morning for breakfast!! I can't believe it took me this long to give it a try!! If you're looking for Authentic tasting, home cooked Mexican food.. this is your spot!

The enchiladas are bomb! Especially the green chili sauce !! They are a MUST try!! And the beans and rice are very delicious as well!! Beans are like nana makes and the rice is perfect flavor! I'm picky about my rice! Haha

When you dine in, the chips aren't free but a must! They're made fresh!! And smell soooooo GOOD! Only a dollar for a huge hot fresh basket! I believe free refills on them too. So a one time charge. They only have hot sauce (I believe.. i nvr asked lol) but both red and green! They're both pretty spicy too !! Like almost no joke on the level of spicy!! I thought I could handle spicy but these are almost not tolerable for me. I think my taste buds have changed with age lol anyways they taste good, but beware of the spicyness! I do wish they had a chunky type of salsa! That's one downside for me.. I love chunky salsa!! 

The chips and salsa are usually a deal breaker for me when I decide whether I like to go back to a Mexican restaurant and although I don't LOVE the hot sauce/salsa, the chips and the food are too good not to go back! So good I take a trip from west Phoenix to east Phoenix!

The chicken tacos are good and chicken enchiladas but I still would go with the green chili cheese enchiladas as my FAVORITE and a must try!!

I've tasted the red menudo ( only ate the hominy) and id say give it a go if your in the mood!! I think it's even rated best in phx! (As what I seen advertised in the restaurant) my dad and mom both loved it!

This spot might not look like somewhere you would think to stop in to, given the location and side of town, but DO IT!! Great portions! Very decent prices!! And Great tasting AUTHENTIC, HOME COOKED Mexican food!! I'd say one of the BEST in Phoenix!! And I'm a picky eater!"}
{"text":"Drinks are weak & from a mix, food is less then desirable & the waitress we got is so cranky that even my spanish speaking friends couldn't get her to crack a smile! skip this joint!"}
{"text":"this place is fantastic. it's very affordable and the portions are huge, especially for the price. the chips are hot and good. the carne asada tacos are the best I've had since moving to phoenix."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for a business trip trying to find a place to eat one night I decided to do some research.  Since I was in the SW I thought about Mexican. So I found in several articles and sites as well as Yelp that Rositas had the best Chile Verde. So I  got done with work early one night so I made my way to Rositas. It has an interesting parking lot, not really near anything, more of a neighborhood or lunch place. I order the mixed plate (half red, half green chile) rice, beans, chips and salsa, and a drink for $10!!!  The red chile and the rice was very good...the green chile the best I ever had!!! Very clean, very good service.  I enjoyed it so much a few nights ago I managed to squeeze it in before I caught my flight back home...this time, all green chile dinner!!!  Attention all Phoenix visitors, its conveniently close to the airport car rental facility!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good authentic food. First time I'm trying it while visiting Phoenix. I definitely would come back"}
{"text":"Best green chicken enchiladas I've ever had in my life!! The side of guacamole can get a bit pricey but it better be award winning because the flavor is unmatched by any other guacamole I've tasted. Have a mango margarita with a chile rim to go with your meal and basque in some if the finest Mexican food this state can offer!"}
{"text":"The food is good and decent for their attempt at authentic Mexican food, but I was more concerned with their staff and they are not very courteous. That's actually the main reason why I have never gone back up to this point."}
{"text":"The food here is delicios, but it takes forever. From the time I ordered to when I was served 25minutes. Come only if you have time to spare to sit and wait."}
{"text":"Its one of the few Restaurants my wife and I frequently visit despite being almost 40 minutes away. The Muchaca Chimi is the best chimi I have ever had. Service is always hit or miss, but the food is ALWAYS great."}
{"text":"The picture says enough! Food and service is beyond excellent! Ive tried nearly everything on the menu and nothing has failed to amaze me! Suggestions: chimichanga, green tamales, menudo, combo plate that comes with tostada, taco, and enchilada. The beans and rice is really good too!"}
{"text":"Wasn't what I expected. Waitress acted pretty bland and rude when she got to our table. Ordered a \"menudo\" and it was more like \"pozole\" with 8 pieces of menudo. My girlfriend ordered a enchilada, tostada and ground beef taco. The enchilada tasted like a tamale, the tostada was a soft taco and the taco was a lettuce taco. Horchata was eh. Was pretty disappointed. Would not recommend if you're looking for a good authentic Mexican restaurant. I don't like writing reviews but I wouldn't want other to be as disappointed as I was and not get what they expected."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Delicious, spicy, flavorful New Mexican style food! We are so picky on our Mexican and this was awesome. The green and red chile were both spicy yet packed with flavor. We couldn't get enough! The salsas are awesome! The pasole was perfect! Will be back for sure. Great service.  in a sketchy part of town though!"}
{"text":"One of the better mexican places in central phoenix - and there are no shortage of them.

All the standards are great. The chips are always fresh. The salsa is HOT. Yum. Their guacamole is freshly made. You can't go wrong. So go. 

Some of my favorites
Cheese crisp w green chiles
Albondingas (mexican meatball) soup
Shredded beef taco
Green corn tamales

Some of the items on the grill menu are superb! 
Pork chops (with fries and beans - ask for cheese on beans!)
Short ribs 

You really can't go wrong. It's inexpensive, fresh, home cooked, clean, and delicious. 

Only downside - the margaritas are kind of weak. On the other hand, they are cheap, so you can have 3 and it won't hurt you too much. :)"}
{"text":"Very cute authentic looking decor,  our waitress was very nice and made suggestions since it was our first time here.  The chips came out hot and green and red salsas were tasty and hot. I liked the red, yum! 
I ordered a beef taco and cheese enchilada,  both very good and we're piping hot! They have you a huge portion too so go with an appetite, I'm STUFFED and my plate still looks full.  Prices are fairly low considering how much food you get. I would come back and try this place again."}
{"text":"EDITED TO ADD: I have been visiting the porcelain express and exorcising demons after leaving that place. 


Where to begin with this place. The place you park is in an alley where stray cats and dogs just freely roam

 around . Then you come in and nobody is pleasant or helpful. The service is bad the food is mediocre and all the waitresses look miserable to working here. Order was wrong and currently still waiting for my sons quesadilla it's been 20 minutes. Not sure where these good reviews came from because we will not be back and pretty sure \"Rosita\" is walking around not checking on customers but counting all the patrons in here. Like I said before will not come again and will warn people against this place. Only reason it's getting two stars is because I felt for our waitress who is expecting and looks exhausted. Long story short stay away from here if you're looking for good service and authenticity. Oh and this is NOT Authentic it's Americanized Mexican please review correctly."}
{"text":"The greatest, wonderful service, big cups of soda, they pack the plates, love the fish pond, love how its set up, the best cheese crisp, \"MY FAVORITE\" Mexican restaurant in PHOENIX!!!!"}
{"text":"Location, location, location...  Yes, the type of service you receive at Rosita's all depends upon where you sit.  My experience:  4 visits sitting in the bar = great service.  1 visit sitting in the dining room = painfully slow service.  So, the bar is definitely the way to go, and not just because it offers closer access to the margaritas.  ;)

Now that we have that out of the way, let me tell you about the three main reasons I love Rosita's:

Hot, salty tortilla chips with spicy salsa - the perfect starter that sets up the appetite perfectly for...

Powerful and potent margaritas - the super nice female bartender is not skimpy on the tequila in these!

And, best of all, the most wonderful carne asada burro I have ever experienced.  This is not your average burro with a bit of meat and lots of 'filler' - rice, etc.  No, this is an enormous tortilla packed with meat, meat and more meat!  If you get it enchilada-style like I do, it will be topped with a delightfully messy mix of cheese and red sauce.  Bite after bite of goodness!

So, clear your afternoon (those margaritas pack a kick!), grab a friend or two and get going!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place after reading all of the great reviews. There's great parking in the back. As you enter, it's a little small but we were greeted by every employee we encountered as we walked in. Our waitress arrived immediately to our table and asked if we would like chips with salsa and took our drink orders. She patiently checked back to take our food order. I ordered a green chile chimichanga, my friends both ordered the red chile chimichanga with rice and beans. The red salsa was good, not spicy, the green salsa had a kick. Both were good as were the chips. My chimichanga was average size topped with sour cream & guacamole- the green chile was flavorful, lots of meat. I just wish it would have had a little more chile sauce, but it was very good. Price was fair. The restaurant looked clean, our order came out quick and our service was great. Will return to try something else."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service. I've been twice now- giant margaritas, incredible tortilla chips, never disappointed. The machaca tacos are my new favorite thing!"}
{"text":"my fiance and i are huge fans of mexican food and there's rarely a time that we're not in the mood to eat it.  when a friend told me they served a speciality frozen horchata drink, i knew we had to check it out.

the frozen horchata is served as a cocktail, and you have the option of getting it with either rum or vodka.  we opted to try both, and they were amazing! i definitely preferred the drink with vodka since it didn't take away from the flavor of the horchata like the rum did. after finishing his drink, my fiance ordered a jamaica margarita with chili on the rim.  i had a couple sips of it and it might have been better than the horchata! 

chips and salsa can really make or break a mexican place for me, so i really appreciated that their chips were hot and salty while the salsas (red and green) were spicy and delicious.  

i ordered the chile relleno, and it came out super hot and covered in tons of cheese. i really enjoyed the flavors of it, and was sad that i could only eat about a third of the meal.  the standard bean and rice sides were also really tasty and better than i've had in a while. 

i will be definitely adding this place to my regular mexican restaurant rotation!"}
{"text":"We've been here many times and have always been satisfied. Last night we tried the shrimp fajitas and were very disappointed! No sizzling hot skillet here! Just a bland cold plate with tiny shrimps, some not cleaned. The place wasn't crowded at 4pm yet we received poor service from a female server who obviously didn't want to be there. They should either do the fajitas right or take them off the menu! :-/"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I have found in the valley. Well worth the drive from Goodyear."}
{"text":"We stopped here because it was on the way to the airport and boy did we luck out! Heard about it through yelp. The geography was right, the reviews were great,  so we thought let's give it a shot. Now if you're a fan of Mexican food from chain restaurants like manuel's or ajo al's, this is not the place for you. this is AUTHENTIC Mexican food. Probably the best in the valley. I was a die-hard via delosantos fan and shouted from the rooftops about how great that place is. I will still say that. But there's a new numero uno on my list! 

The green salsa is nice and spicy the way I like it. I don't like having to pay for chips. They should be complementary. But paying the $1 for these is worth it. They are fried to order so they come out crisp and hot. The guacamole is creamy with nice chunks of avocado throughout. 

I ordered the chicharones because I was feeling adventurous and had never tried it before. Looking it up on Google described it as fried pork rinds so that's what I was expecting. Unfortunately I got soggy pieces of skin. Maybe that's the way they are supposed to be. I don't know. The flavor wad good but the texture wasn't appealing. The menu also states that this dish is \"very hot.\" It was the complete opposite with hardly any spice to it at all. I won't be ordering that again. The bites I had of my nephew's carne asada chimichanga was to die for though! 

Everyone raved about the beans here being the best ever... and they got it right! Delicious flavor. Probably made the authentic way with lard, but does it really matter at this point? I'm eating pig skin anyway! 

Service was great! We were waited on by a lovely older Hispanic woman that has been there for over 20 years. She was so pleasant she kept bringing a smile to my face. 

This is definitely my new favorite Mexican joint, not just for trips to and from the airport. It's worth driving down there just for rositas place :-)"}
{"text":"After an airport pickup, my company wanted some authentic Mexican. Took to Yelp to help us out and we were sadly let down. The service was abysmal. Our server came the second we sat down to get our food and drink order, but never having dined there we had no idea what to get. After some time spent talking and eating the salsa from the hottest depths of hell, we realized we hadn't see her in around 20 minutes so we asked for someone to take our order.

Let me just say, I'm not cheap (swear!) I just hate getting ripped off. We ordered one machaca chimi with rice and beans and another exactly the same but not deep fried, got it? The bill read $10 for the first one and $14 for the second. The menu reads you can get anything deep fried for an additional $1, so why the heck was I charged $4 for saving the cook time and precious fryer oil? DUMB. 

Other notable annoyances: they were out of horchata with no answer to when more would be made, the beans were nearly white- too much lard?, the machaca beef was inedible due to many crispy/nasty/grisly bits, the server never came back to check on us or any tables around us after the food was dropped off. 

We left both our meals on the table and will not be back. Ever. 


Never, ever."}
{"text":"Been coming here since the original building wad located much closer to sky harbor. 
I've even driven family here from tucson as I feel there is nothing local to compare it to.

Whatever is ordered is sure to be a winner.  My personal favorite is the taco toscada and enchilada with rice and beans.  No visit would be complete without the cooked to order tortilla chips with the house made red and green salsa"}
{"text":"Ambiance is definitely lacking. If the owner/manager ever cares  to read this review this would be my suggestion:  
Get rid of the lights on the ceiling fans. And if you're not willing to get rid of those lights or turn them off, put in  warm bulbs -not cool. The lighting is just absolutely horrific. Put on some Spanish music - like flamenco -would really make this place seem classy. I know, I know it's Mexican food. Or even put on some authentic mariachi music that would really take this place to the next level. That being said, the food is spot on. Exactly what I expected and it is always so consistent. Somehow there are so many business owners that don't realize the value of nice dim lighting and music even if it's quiet in the background. There's a jukebox in here, in my opinion... A terrible terrible idea. Just choose the music you don't want people decide most people are going to put on crap or in this case nobody is playing any music and all I'm hearing is hum of  the air-conditioning."}
{"text":"Food is still great but the service was terrible!!!!!! We have been their many times and we have never had service so bad before. It was the older lady with short hair and I just can't believe she totally ignored us. We were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food!  Service was quick and staff was nice!  Very authentic mexican food and some of the best tamales I've had!  Definitely try the green tamales!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and today I decided it was time to write a review.  As usual it was great.  I swore i would try something different today however when our server arrived i decided to go with old faithful and again ordered Carnitas.  My coworkers order the Chile Relleno and a Burrito,  All were extremely good!!!  THe chips and Salsa are a must have."}
{"text":"I'm in town for business and the guy at the front desk of the hotel recommended this place and it was a definite winner!

Drove up, and frankly it's not in the best neighborhood but the guy in the parking lot keeping watch over the cars in the lot with a \"Security\" t shirt on put me at ease. 

Sat down and was welcomed immediately and offered the fresh chips and incredibly hot red and green salsa.  Although, I'm kind of a pansy when it comes to hot and spicy.  I Just ate the chips plain and they were wonderful.

Had the Chicken Mole Enchiladas which were undeniably the best I've had.  The mole sauce was perfectly made with just the right amount of chocolate.  I have the stains all over my shirt to prove it!  The beans and rice were nice accompaniments.  

Everyone knows the traditional \"Mexican\" restaurants where you go in and order the # 13 and they're all the same right?  Rosita's Place is NOT this type of eatery.  The food is authentic as authentic comes and should not be missed."}
{"text":"We've been coming here sporadically for several years.  Rosita's has remained consistent and delicious. Best chips around. Definitely where the locals go - that says it all."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Mexican food restaurant for years! This place has by far the best green chili in phoenix! Also the staff, and service is excellent! One more thing, if you like menudo... The red menudo is by far the best I've ever had!!! This place is a staple!"}
{"text":"Rosita's is the little local gem that I stumbled upon, if you're use to commercial mexican food like Macayos then you're in the wrong place! Remember the chips cost a dollar, but I'm not complaining they are so worth it. Steaming hot and fresh when they come out to you and served with a delicious fiery red and green salsa. Whenever I go there I have to order the green chili tamales, mmm it is so yummy!! They have delicious authentic mexican drinks as well, and I tried their mango-chile and rum mixed drink, it is a must if you like the mexican candies it tastes like that but blended in a cold alcoholic concoction. I love the decoration as well, some beautiful paintings with festive colors splashed on the walls. A fun and laid back place to go when your craving mexican food! Two thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"New times said this place had some good menudo, I came by to see for myself.  I must say it didn't disappoint.  I tried the Red while my girlfriend had the white and they both tasted pretty damn good.  Aside from that I had a taco and enchilada combo too and that was pretty decent.  The ground beef in the taco was mixed with potato which gave it an interesting consistency, good yes but different.  
I'd definitely come back and try the rest of the menu and maybe one of them supersize margaritas I see around flowing around me.  

My only negative review I would say is they should definitely have the toilets checked out, I didn't lay anything major but it didn't wanna flush. Also the water tasted like it was freshly from Mexico, maybe it boosted the food a bit but it didn't quench my thirst."}
{"text":"Machaca burro enchilada style will fill you up for days.  Massive burrito at a cheap price.  Not the greatest chips n salsa (hot sauce is actually served), yet the burrito makes it all worth it.  Favorite place to go during lunch with my old coworkers, and that was coming from Tempe.  Probably more of a 4 star place, but giving 5 stars for size, cost, and the nostalgia of eating many lunches here."}
{"text":"The food is great and there is not a long wait. The portions are HUGE so come hungry! Only down side is no kids menu but they have a great cheese crisp for them!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of home (Southern New Mexico). I'm a total Mexican food snob, but this place blows my skirt up. It floats my boat. It has that traditional feel, like the way grandma used to make it. I recommend any of the combinations. Come hungry. The portions are healthy."}
{"text":"We traveled from North Phoenix to try this place, looking for some authentic Mexican flare, and partly because a friend recommended it.  The food wasn't awful, but it wasn't worth the drive either.  My favorite places in the Valley are Manuel's or Ajo Al's so I often compare other mexican food places against those two.  Despite its authenticity, Rosita's did not make it over the Ajo Al's hump, I hate to say.  

One word to the wise and/or time-sensitive types:  this place takes its time when it comes to service.  I would stay clear of Rosita's if you are in a hurry, because getting the bill, alone, took close to half an hour.  Our waitress virtually disappeared during this process and the other two (yes, two) people who helped us with our bill also took their sweet time."}
{"text":"i've only been here a few times for take out, so i can't speak for the service.  my food was TERRIFIC-- especially the carne asada burros and guacamole-- and ready for me when i arrived.  the salsas (i loooooved the green) were good as well.  i've eaten a lot of mexican food in my day, and this was top notch."}
{"text":"So much food!! I felt stuffed after eating here. This was one of the top Mexican places, off the Basis of being restaurant style mexican food.

Great portions, service is okay, food is delicious, but not to the type that I like. I love/prefer Mexican street food, so yeah. This wasn't my absolute favorite for Mexican food. I would go again though. Don't get me wrong"}
{"text":"Horrible service rude waitress not authentic food at all more american than Mexican drinks where not fresh"}
{"text":"Our last night in Phoenix and we decided to try Mexican.   Decide on this place based on Yelp reviews.   I had the combo with a beef taco, bean tostada, and cheese enchilada because I couldn't decide.  Usually not a fan of the enchilada sauce but this sauce was excellent!!  Beans and enchilada were my favorite!"}
{"text":"This place does NOT deserve even 1 star!! Maybe they were good at one point but not anymore! Went there Sunday for dinner at 5pm with my family from out of town and they were out of a lot of things on the menu. So you'd think they must be good right? WRONG! Waitress was rude and short with us while smacking her gum. We asked for coke and she didn't even bother to let us know they only had Pepsi. (THEY AREN'T THE SAME!!!) I never got my water. Take a good look at your bill because they over charge any chance they get!! My mom ordered a bean, rice and cheese burrito and they charged us $9.85. REALLY? And they forgot about the rice so they gave it to her on the side and asked is that ok after they brought it out. My sister and dad ordered the green chile with beef and both left most of it. I ordered the 2 hard shell chicken tacos with rice and beans, the shells were soft and oily from being under cooked. Rice wasn't good. I had chicken nerves in my taco and the chicken alone didn't taste good without the lettuce and cheese. My niece ordered fries and they were burned. No kids menu so my 8 year old niece ordered from the regular menu and left most of it since she's a kid and doesn't eat that much. Anyway, last time we go there. Only thing good was the beer.  The only reason we left tip was because they charged it since there were 7 of  us. Never again!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food!! If you're in the mood for great Mexican food, look nowhere else. Chips and salsa are nice and spicy. Plus, this place is in the hood so that in itself enhanced my experience."}
{"text":"Rosita's has been our favorite place for years. We often have large family lunches here and family gatherings. They're always wonderful and accommodating. 

The food is amazing. They have the best beans ever. The green beef chili is just so amazing my mouth waters as I type this. 

If you've not been you must try it."}
{"text":"Once again ... the negative reviews by fellow yelpers ... can be so lame. Talk about first world problems, here. 

News flash: mexican food can be very unhealthy. Especially tortilla chips that arrive to the table so piping hot that you have to wait for them to cool down before indulging. Salty, spicy hot, warm, crunch.

The mol√© here is the only one that is as delicious as my mom's mole. Seriously that good. The margaritas are stiff and delish. This place is here for the food, not the service ... though the service has always been great.  

This restaurant is one of the best of it's kind. Major bonus: if you want to hear music, play it on the jukebox. Totally off the wall eclectic selection, gotta love it."}
{"text":"What can I say? The best Mexican food restaurant in Central Phoenix!
The service was phenomenal and the food was even better!
Parking was behind the building in a very spacious lot which was being guarded by several security guards who went up and down the rows, I felt very safe!!

Upon entering I was greeted by a young man who greeted me and seated me rather promptly. My waiter came within five minutes and brought chips and salsa! I ordered the Chimichanga and a michelada. WOW! The meat was seasoned perfectly, not too much like some places and the frying was good, no excessive oil. I will definitely come back!

Give it a try if you desire REAL Mexican food!"}
{"text":"We have been going here for 40+ years. Every business should be allowed an off day here and there, but 3 times in a row is way too many!

The first time, it took forever for the waitress to come over once we were seated. After what seemed like forever we finally got some chips and salsa and then the waitress finally appeared. My son's order came out way before mine, so far in advance that he was done eating when mine arrived. Once I finally got my enchilada and beans, the beans were cold and the cheese was not even melted in the enchilada and I had to send it back! Again, can't find the waitress and getting front of house is almost impossible! Finally the food was sent back, by the time it came back again, my son really wanted to go home, and quite frankly so did I! 

My dad said to give them another try.... I did. 

The second time my daughter really wanted to go for her birthday. Once seated, it took forever to get service. Finally someone brought salsa and chips, then a huge long wait for the waitress to come to the table. When the waitress finally came, our order was taken and it took over 20 minutes to get our drinks! When the food finally came out, the beef in the chimichangas was tough, I had to ask for the side of sour cream and guacamole over 3 times before it was brought out, the guacamole had zero flavor, worst meal ever! We needed refills on the drinks and chips, again good luck getting service from your waitress or the front of house. I asked 3 different people for boxes to go, that took over 15 minutes to get! Took another 15 minutes after that just to get the bill! When I got home, I fed the leftovers to the chickens! 

After this, I was never going back! 

Dad just drove in from CA and the first place he wanted to go was here... I told him it would be a mistake... it was!

Again, hard to get service. There are about 10 tables and 4 waitresses! We placed our order, waited so long for our drinks that the basket of chips was almost gone before they arrived. Dad had the chile rellenos with a side of beans w/enchilada sauce and corn tortillas, I had a cheese enchilada w/beans and a side of sour cream. The chile rellenos were a mish mash of peppers and no cheese in sight, they did not put the enchilada sauce on the plate, forgot the sour cream, the beans were horribly over salted and did not bring the corn tortillas until the meal was almost done. Tried to get someones attention, anyone's attention to get a to go box! We left w/o the box. 

This was a different waitress each time I went. I am so disappointed that customer service from the waitresses and front of house is non existent, so not customer friendly anymore! The food is also not what it use to be either! 

Dad said I was right! We will never be going back!"}
{"text":"Oh my god I wasn't sure about this place pull in up but I should have after deein its a hole in the wall Mexican food restraunt this place is AMAZING the food is Fenominal the salsa is tasty and spicy and the food is out of this world first time here and everything looks soo good I wasn't sure on what to order I will be back to have more mmmmmmmm mmmmmmm good When u come here no matter what u get u need to try the Guacamole hands down the best Guacamole ive ever had in my life & im not exagerating its extremely fresh & addictive"}
{"text":"This place could have been four stars, but the service was so God awful. It took several minutes to be acknowledged and seated. It then took about five minutes to be acknowledged by a server and a drink order taken. Five minutes later she comes back with the drinks and takes our order. She brought out salsa with the drinks but no chips. I asked about them and she said they'll be right out. It took about another 15 minutes to get the chips. The chips and salsa were very good, not the best, but well above average. The food followed about another 15-20 minutes after the chips.

I ordered a carne asada burrito enchilada style which was excellent. My daughter got a machaca taco with beans and rice. My daughter didn't like the machaca, which I tried and figured out it was really carne seca. The waitress noticed my daughter didn't like it and I pointed out it was carne seca and not machaca. She apologized and removed it from the bill, which redeemed her some. My daughter ended up having some of my carne asada.

The ambiance is divey and it wasn't very clean, but not unhealthy clean.

I probably wouldn't go back if in the area again, but mostly due to the bad service."}
{"text":"Exceptional little place with authentic Mexican grinds. Beers, menudo, chorizo, Mexi-pizza, huevos divorciados, and the posolo were all delicious. Ya can't go wrong bere."}
{"text":"Highly recommended! This place is the bomb! Don't even bother with the yuppified, hipstered places.
My girlfriend & I went here couple of days ago. We were both very satisfied with our selections. She got the green chili chicken, chicken quesadillas & one other thing which I can't remember. I got the chicken enchilada mole platter. OMG! The best mole I've ever had. definitely hitting this place again before going back to Seattle!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Az for over 40 years, and have been going to Rositas Place since it was down on lower Buckeye and 20th st. The green sauce is my favorite, and yesterday the red was on point also. Almost always order the same thing: Green chili burro with green sauce. The burro is big enough and I try to only eat half, so I have a great leftover. Yes, they charge a buck for chips - but they are hot, fresh and right from the fryer, just the way I like them! Modelo Especial on tap :-)
We drive from Tempe just to eat here when we crave a good Mexican food plate. Beans are also excellent, as well as the green corn tamales. Enjoy."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, everything was absolutely spectacular. No complaints at all. 

Went here for the second time, last week and found myself far less satisfied than my first visit. There are not many vegetarian options, which is normally ok for me. I'm not difficult to please. Unfortunately, if I'm ordering a vegetarian dish, I'd really prefer not to find meat in it. This distinctly tainted my views on the place and I will not be going back here."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. It is a hole in the wall and yes they charge for chips but the food is excellent. Worth the drive since it's not super close by. Customer service is always wonderful and o always enjoy eating at Rositas."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I've had menudo in Tucson, El Paso and home made by my ex-mother in law, Mexican from Juarez, and I liked this one better...

The chips were made to order, the salsa was really good and the place was clean, including the restrooms. Staff was friendly and good prices. Too bad I don't live in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Probably the best Mexican food I have had. Amazing. Not the best area but nice clean and great service. Food incredible"}
{"text":"I can see why this place has such high ratings.  The staff were really nice, the service was outstanding.  I didn't find it slow at all, especially since what you are waiting for is fresh food.  The interior was spacious.  There were gentlemen playing guitars in the corner. The prices were good, particularly considering how much food you get.  I ended up taking more than half of my food home.  
The food was delicious!  The two kinds of salsa were both fresh and delicious.  The red was my favorite of the two because of its smoky flavor.  They make their chips on the spot when you order them, so they were hot and crunchy.  I ordered the machaca. I had never had it before and it was phenomenal.  I also ordered the green chile, which I expected to be spicier since it had an * warning, but I could have handled a little more heat to the dish.  I can only imagine what they put in the refried beans to make them so good, my arteries probably should not inquire.  They serve homemade tortillas, hot and fresh.  They can bury me in one like a shroud one day.  
I will definitely go back to try other things."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Rosita's Place since I first came to Phoenix in 1997. The food and service have always been above average. Although the neighborhood is kind of sketchy we have never had any trouble there and at night an employee is watching the parking lot, which is behind the building. They have excellent carne asada and their refried beans are the best I have ever had. It's a long drive for us now, so we don't get to eat there as often as we'd like, but I have recommended Rosita's Place and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"The chicken chimichanga was REALLY HUGE! And quite tasty. I couldn't finish it, though I really tried!

The chips and salsa cost a dollar. IN TEXAS THAT IS NOT A THING!! Chips and salsa are free in Texas, so hopefully other Mexican restaurants will 'get with the program'. 

Their fajitas come with homemade tortillas (DELICIOUS), and the salsa was tasty. The mango drink tasted canned but their horchata is great!

It's a very kid friendly environment. There's a waterfall near the entrance (with fish in it!). Service was okay. Could have been better, could have been worse. I would go back for the food and hope for better service (that's why the 3 stars only, not 4)."}
{"text":"This place has really good Mexican food!!! I went for lunch and had the chicken burro enchilada style with green chili sauce. It was excellent!!! The chips are very good also but the red and green salsa are a little bit spicy. Overall a very good place and good prices."}
{"text":"I was visiting from L.A. and my friend said he'd been there and thought I would like it. Ok. I have my faves: I'm a fan of chile rellenos, I like hard shell tacos and my regular order is a chicken enchilada with salsa verde. Which one, which one.... All three! Piggy. It was the best taco of my life, fresh made tortilla slightly pinched in at the top with A+ cheese and fresh, cold lettuce and a large amount of deliciously prepared shredded chicken. I wanted more than one but then.... I had ordered a taste of the mole and was blown away by the fresh spices I could taste, definitely NOT a mix. Chicken enchilada was served with a skirt surround of melted cheese that was so beautiful I'm sorry I didn't photograph it first. I took half of that home with me and intended to do the same for the chile relleno, but I couldn't - I ate every bit but for a little taste to my friend, and it was not small. You go for the food, right? They serve Negro Modelo and the best Mexican food I've had in a very long time. I cannot recommend this culinary fix enough. Not that I'd move there but you Phoenixians are lucky to have this culinary treat and with such reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Food was OK. Have had better and also worse. But check your bill before paying. Just had 3 people add the bill and all 3 had different totals. Seemed like the server was trying to get away with adding additional gratuity ON TOP of the already added gratuity for a larger group by \"adding wrong\". That doesn't sit well in my book. Check you bill people."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite Mexican restaurant for many years.  I usually get cheese enchiladas with the green sauce, and also a machaca taco on the side.  You can't go wrong with the two salsas brought to the table----both hot, a green one and a red one alongside warm chips.  But if you want something really spicy (delicious) try the steak picado.  The ambience, the vibe, the food----its been the best for a long time."}
{"text":"Finally my search for the best red menudo in town has landed me here!  My only suggestion is that a warm bolillo roll in place of a tortilla be served. I have yet to try other menu items, other than a michelada. The cold michelada is served in a tall mug with a side of beer. The restaurant is simple, cozy, colorful and the owner is gracious. I loved the menudo so much and placed a to-go order to deliver to my parents. Mom agreed this was the best menudo she's had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Everything is great from the start when you get the chips and salsa. Even when I get takeout I order chips and salsa. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Came in for Sunday breakfast. Server was the reason why I didn't do a one star. Chips and salsa were good. Food was very mediocre. Hashbrowns came out with no color and soggy. Sent them back, they came back with no color and soggy. Yea, not eating those. Asked for chorizo with fried eggs, but got it all scrambled. Ook...guess I don't get to decide my own food. Not busy btw. Tamales were old and tough as leather. Which is really strange thing for Tamales. Ordered eggs and bacon and the eggs were so over cooked, just supposed to be scrambled but has more brown than the hashbrowns. Bacon was thrown in the deep fryer making a dry powdery product. I'll come back here when I'm hungover. I won't mind the mediocre food for the price they offer. Ok, if I could do two and half stars I would. Between service and prices it deserves it, but the kitchen really dropped the ball in produces some horrible breakfast. Again our server, Reina, was fantastic, just wanted to mention it again."}
{"text":"BEST Mexican restaurant in Phoenix!!! 

Authentic Mexican food, not Americanized like Macayo's (yuck!), & still very affordable! Large portions! Always delicious!!! 

I always try to take friends & family anytime anyone visits Phoenix! 
 

(P.S.,
Watch the low-rated reviews... They're often not reasonable! 1 complained that there was a difference in price for a \"machaca chimi & another exactly the same but not deep fried\"... Well, that's simple to figure out if they'd actually looked at the menu! Chimi is deep fried & has 1 price, but BURROS are not deep fried & differently priced!

Another complained just because they're closed for renovations! WTF?!)"}
{"text":"Came here my accident was starving and wanted Mexican. This place is awesome. Authentic, great tasting and priced well a lunch/dinner for 2 is about 18 dollars. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Tremendously spicy salsa, my mouth was burning but it was so good I kept going back for more. I ordered the bean and cheese burrito (that was no burrito, burro muy grande) enchilada style. I could actually taste the lard in the beans. I ate half and took the rest home. 

Healthy? No! Cheap and delicious. Si! I will be back."}
{"text":"Had high expectations for good, local, authentic Mexican food.  Green salsa was amazing but favorable review ends there.  Drink order was wrong, both our food orders were wrong and what we did get was not flavorful (except by putting the green salsa on it).   Service was slow.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good service. Excellent food. I ordered the taco, enchilada, tostada combo. Very delicious. Loved the beans and rice."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying the employees here are fantastic. They are helpful, kind, and informative. I came in on a To-go order and they had gotten an item wrong, when called, they promptly took the correct order and said I can come pick it up free of charge. I appreciate the hospitality and customer service I was given with no questions. I will definitely be coming back to rositas."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years during lunchtime. Chiqui has been our staple here and has always done a wonderful job of entertaining and servicing our needs.

I order anything from the Tamales to the Fajitas, they really serve quality Sonoran style Mexican Food here.

I recommend this establishment to anyone and will always come back."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Arizona! The service, food and prices are absolutely amazing! I love the green chili meal that comes with delicious rice and beans! The menudo is to die for and the chorizo is the best I've ever had! Give Rositas a try and it'll quickly become your favorite too!!"}
{"text":"The food is and always be the star of the show at Rositas Place! The red chile beef consists of large pieces of beef, stewed with red chilies (probably dried) until super tender. Easy enough to smash with your fork while eating. The red chili burro (which is huge!) is somewhere around $8 if memory serves me correctly so I always have them make it enchilada style: slathered in delicious red enchilada sauce and cheese then passed through the oven. Authentic sonoran flavors? YES! 
 The red and green salsa that comes out with the freshly fried corn tortilla chips upon sitting down is also amazing. I swear, if no one were looking I could drink that stuff! Both are an excellent topping for the carne machaca tacos: shredded beef cooked with peppers, onions and tomatoes. 
Another favorite part of Rosita's place for myself is the ambience. I've been eating here for over 15 years, and I don't think it's changed a single bit, probably since its existence. When I walk in, I feel like I'm at home. A couple of the lovely older waitresses have been here for quite some time and they totally remind me of the parents of good friends growing up, and its not suprising to be addressed as \"mijo\" or \"mija\"...
Being that I no longer live in the southwest, whenever I'm in Phoenix, Rositas Place in an absolute must stop while in town...without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Okay,  we tried this place out on Saturday for dinner.  I would say this place is delicious.  You pay for your tortillas chips $1 but they give you a hefty serving..... The waitress was awesome.  WE ended up getting a shredded beef chimichanga and carne asada burrito enchilada Style, well worth it.  We will definitely be back."}

Full Review:
This is one of those times when \"Meh. I've experienced better\" fits perfectly. I was so excited to come eat here :( Like Los Compadres it had been on the list for a long time. A 4 star Mexican place with very few bad reviews seemed like a safe bet. This place also showed up on Chow Bella a few days ago. I was prepared for another kick ass meal but figured I was in for meh service based on what I read. Seems like I received the complete 180 of an experience.

Got there about 7:30 Saturday night. The place was 65% capacity at most. This surprised the heck out of me considering the time/reviews and recent writeup. Figured I was doomed for a night of waiting. We were at out table within 2 minutes and the waitress was there to take our drink order and drop off salsa in less then 5. She quickly returned with some HUGE glasses of water an a basket of chips. I was ready for these amazing hot from the fryer chips I had read so much about. What I got instead was room temp chips of which 1/2 had a nice freshly dipped in grease then cooled coat on them. I'm a good sport so I tried one of the greasy ones and all I could taste was room temp oil from a fryer that needed fresh oil in a bad bad way.. Blech :(

The salsa however was very tasty. The red was far from burning hot that I had read so much about. It was warm but far from spicy and was one of the best things I would eat all evening. The green was also very flavorful and masked the gross chips well.

We ordered a huge pile of food including a cheese crisp and guacamole which hit the table quickly. We were then in for a good 20 minute wait before the rest of the food showed up.

Food Details:

Guacamole:
Very simple prep here. Avocado, Onion, Salt and 800lbs of tomatoes. I absolutely HATE fresh tomatoes but that's just a personal preference. The quac was fresh and tasty. There was nothing \"wrong\" with it there's just much better at countless places.

Rice:
So far from exciting I don't specifically recall. I just remember having a bite and moving on. Was a little greasy and bland :/

Beans:
Just went I thought dinner was a complete waste I took a few bites of these and WOW! some of the best beans I've ever had. Pretty sure there is a huge amount of lard but who cares. The texture was perfect.. the flavor was perfect.. I could have been satisfied with a side of quac, couple tortillas and a huge bowl of beans. Half of it was smashed/creamed and the other was whole beans. I'm not even a bean person and it was the only part of my plate that had been scrapped clean.

Cheese Crisp:
No real crisp at all. Just a tortilla with melted cheese and a major pool of grease.

Green Chili Tamale:
The texture was very rubbery but it was at least spicy. This was another \"not bad but far from great\" items.

Ground Beef Taco:
The shell was nice and crispy and didn't taco fail. The meat inside was this super fine texture but did not have a lot of flavor.

Chili Relleno:
Oh man.. I've been trying to figure this one out. Terrible is the only word I have for it. There were two of them on the table and they were both the same. The batter was literally water logged and there was nothing on the plate to do that. They weren't greasy.. they were watery. I'm nearly positive these were made in house, frozen, and heated to order. There's no other way they could get a spongy soggy texture like that any other way.

Enchilada:
Suffered from more cheese on top of my enchilada then inside of it and a serious lack of red sauce. Don't get me wrong.. I like cheese but it was 10% red sauce and 90% cheese. I couldn't even really taste the red sauce to see if it was any good. The enchilada was a corn tortilla with a sprinkle of cheese on the inside. It was literally flat on the plate like someone folded it then smashed it down that's how skimpy the filling was.

Red Sauce:
Don't know.. there was not enough of it on anything to actually taste it.


Could this have been an off night? I guess its possible but I order so much variety that it pretty much rules out having a bad experience because a single item wasn't good that night. Is this the worst Mexican in town? Far from it.. But there are so many other great places I feel sorry for anyone who might call this their only Mexican stop when they have a craving. They are missing out on some real good food out there."}
{"text":"Rosita's Place Rocks! It has the right amount of dive atmosphere with just excellent food. The green & red sauce are both pretty hot and spicy Chips are fresh and fried on premises. All entrees are quite big and enough to feed two. It draws interesting crowd. I was there with some folks from work after a conference and so were in suits. There were some families, retired folks, emo-kids and bubbas. Try the combination burro with enchilada sauce. Can't go wrong with that. Beer and tequila is reasonably price."}
{"text":"Quaint little place with SOME OF THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD in the valley in my 11+ years living here. Fresh fried chips, delicious salsas, huge portions of GOOD food. I had a combination platter of chicken taco, refried bean tostada, and chicken enchilada with beans and rice. Amazing. I'm going to dream of the refried beans for days. Co-workers got burros. They were enormous! Will be back with friends and out-of-town visitors."}
{"text":"I was honestly shocked at how absolutely amazing the food was at Rosita's because it is in the Ghetto (which happens to be less than two miles from my place ha ha).... and I was honestly shocked at how bad the service was. Normally Mexican restaurants have the best service, but man... it was literally a 2 hour dinner only because it was 20 minutes in between times where we saw our waitress and it took FOREVER to get the food even though they were not that busy. 

I had the Mexican eggs with beans.. DELISH. I was eating slow waiting for my delayed tortilla to arrive and I was over halfway done when it finally got there. I must say, a warm, fresh tortilla makes everything better! 

Honestly, the food was really, really good and if it we-rent for the REALLY bad service I would have given this place at least a four... maybe a five."}
{"text":"Lived in Phoenix my whole life and recently found Rosita's because my daughter has softball practices at nearby St Agnes church. Gotta say this place is great, authentic and down to earth. Food has great flavor and hot salsa green is actually hot. Sylvia takes care of us on Tuesday nights at the bar and food is both excellent and reasonably priced. Today Jennifer is helping us and great service. Quesadilla with carne asada is awesome. Wash it down with Ice cold Modelo draft served in frosty mugs. Doesn't get much better. Definitely a must when in the neighborhood.  Bonus chips always served super fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Nice to see real Mexican food remains in the valley.  This food is excellent just like the food I grew up on over 30 years ago. Reasonably-priced, friendly and quick service, great margaritas--I'll be back."}
{"text":"All the great reviews are what brought me here on a weekday work lunch. Since I take late lunches, there was no wait to be seated so that was awesome. Like many Mexican places in the area, chips and salsa are complimentary. The chips were actually pretty good and freshly made. 

For our entrees, we got 2 combinations of chicken tacos w/ rice & beans and beef tacos w/ rice & beans. They were honestly just okay and mediocre. Upon arrival of our food, we were surprised to see that they came with hardshell tacos instead of the soft tacos we were craving. We later realized that the server should've asked us which one we wanted and she must've just forgotten, but we just let it go and ate our food. My chicken was bland, so I asked for lime (they didn't have it so they gave me lemons instead, which was fine) to add to the flavor. Even with those efforts, I unfortunately could not enjoy my food.

When we were ready to go, we couldn't find our server (or anyone, really) so we can get the check. It turns out that everyone was on lunch/break. I understand employee breaks, but I think it would've been considerate and a good business practice to have at least one person on the floor checking on customers, instead of everyone just disappearing. We spent about 5 mins trying to hunt someone down so we could get our check and go. I think I'd also be more forgiving had our server been friendly, but every interaction with her just felt like she was ready to get rid of us.

I'm not sure if Rosita's just had a bad afternoon when I went, but I will honestly probably not come back here out of my own free will unless I'm invited here by someone else."}
{"text":"Though what we ordered was tasty, this does not appear to be the place to go if you're looking for nutritious vegetables to accompany your entree."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended to me by a friend after I expressed my craving for Mexican. We went and while the waitress was nice, my food was  sub par at best I can't explain it but it was average, I wasn't feeling too good on the night we went so I decided to hold off on my yelp review and give them another chance - which I did 3 weeks later. I ordered a completely different dish and my review remains the same, just average. The fresh chips were great but they also charge you for them so I expect them to be better than the complimentry ones you receive at your typical mexican joint."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  We decided to drive across town and try it based on the Yelp reviews and it was definitely a letdown.  Not horrible but not particularly good either.

On a Friday night at 7:30, it was less than half full. The people at the door were not particularly friendly but little did we know that it would go downhill from there.  Our waitress was one of the most surly servers I've ever had anywhere.  No greeting, no smile, no eye contact.  Just a look of pained exasperation.  We asked her a few questions and she simply ignored them.  It was not busy.  Seriously, the unfriendliness of the staff here is hard to overstate.  They just don't give a damn.

The food was all over the place.

Salsas - excellent, both red and green. Nice and spicy just like we like it.

Chips - fresh, but greasy.

Chicken enchiladas in mole sauce - quite good. Humongous portion.

Steak Tampiquena  - just ok.  Not really a traditional Tampiquena.   About four ounces (or less) of pounded round steak with no topping of any kind.  Not bad but a bit pricey for the eleven bucks or so they are asking and not up to the standard that you get at most Mexican joints around town.

Beans - Awesome, as many reviewers point out.  Some of the best refried beans I've ever had. By far the highlight of the meal.

Guacamole -  Overwhelmed by the flavor of what I can only guess to be powdered citric acid instead of fresh lime juice.  Very odd and not really nice at all.  What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn't use fresh limes?  

Mariachis - insistent and annoying.  And a bit much for a place like this really.

$35 with two cheap drinks and a totally unwarranted tip."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: A good old mom and pops Mexican restaurant...classical Mexican decor....large seating area....lively

Food: great bang for your buck, spicy and flavorful, menudo is spectacular, everything else is good and on par with other restaurants

Service: friendly staff, just a little slow and unorganized"}
{"text":"Actually should be a 4.5  star rating.  Food is plenty and tasted great. Not to mention the portions and very reasonable pricing.  The giant Margaritas were not bad either. Will coming back soon."}
{"text":"Rositas has grown with the city of Phoenix, The first location was originally downtown and the restaurant slowly made its way to just West McDowell and 24th St.   Mexican Food is taken a serious art in the Central Phoenix area.  Rositas is a dominate location that keeps people excited to return."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat from our long drive from California. It seemed to be a taco shop in every corner but this place was the only one with customers.  I was very surprised how good the food  was and huge portions. The chips and salsa were great and freshly made. I think our waitress name was Dolores and she was awesome. She took such good care of us and when we come back we will come here first."}
{"text":"Heard great reviews about the menudo but it was mediocre.  We had to add salt and lemon to build the flavor.  The broth was bland and thin. aunt had the chicken mole and was heavy and bitter. everyone makes it different and that's ok.  would definitely come back and try other items though for a different experience. Michelada was refreshing .The server checked on our drinks as needed, didn't clear away our plates as people's finished their meals though which was a bit odd compared to most restaurants."}
{"text":"I write this as I sit awaiting for my food.  I've been waiting for an hour now.  At a table with 10 other people, and the food is brought out 1 or 2 at a time.  This will be my last visit."}
{"text":"Consistently satisfying. You know it's going to be good when the tortilla chips (1st basket comp., nominal charge for add'l.) are delivererd too hot to touch at first, lightly salted, with 2 choices, red or green salsa. The combo plates are generously portioned, flavorful, perfectly-balanced, complex in seasoning, comfort food. STRONG margaritas. Watch out! Never get \"adverse side effects\" from eating Mexican food here. A little pricey, but worth it. Take relatives visiting from out-of-state here for an authentic Mexican restaurant experience."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Maybe ever. I've been going to this restaurant for at least 14 years. I love the food and I love the people who work here. I've heard people get offended by the blunt nature of the employees, but the employees are one of my favorite things about this place. I love their to-the-point personalities. It's much like the nature of my family and a mutual understood relationship. Don't get butthurt because it's how families work in our culture :D for fun, I'll tell you this story about butthurt customers. The husband ordered a machaca burrito and the wife made a big fuss about how the meat was too DRY. Uhm... that's what machaca is!!!! Anyways, the employees are badass, the food is amazing, and the decor is BEAUTIFUL. it's colorful walls with authentic tile, flooring, and art. 

Long story short, it's a great restaurant and I recommend it. Reminds me of the food my Nana made growing up."}
{"text":"Great Service and A Variety of Menu Selections. I really enjoyed breakfast. Come check it out!"}
{"text":"Chips were Hot & Fresh...Very Hot! The food was wonderful. Our order was somewhat lost in translation. Our sever asked us again if that is what we wanted. I said yes. We got enough food for 4 people. We got the plates of tacos rather than 2 individual tacos! These plates include beans and rice of course. I did not even dig in to my Chimichanga, as I was so full of chips & salsa, and my tacos of course. The d√©cor is very simple, and the seating/booths are very basic. You are not going here for the local ambiance; you are going to come here for the Yummy Mexican Food! I will go back!"}
{"text":"Came in here on a recommendation from friends and glad we did. Traditional Mexican food, served in a very traditional setting. The burrito enchilada style was great, the margaritas were great and the servings were very generous. Gets super busy on the weekend so prepare to wait."}
{"text":"We are new to this part of town so we were looking for good Mexican food. As soon as we walked in I had a feeling we should have left, the customer service already pretty low. Our waitress was the same way, just a little too grouchy and maybe we were inconvenient. The food was okay, the cheese enchiladas were pretty standard but were sitting in a puddle of grease. I get it, Mexican food is generally greasy but this was a little overkill. I would have perhaps given the food another try in the future, but I'm pretty big on customer service so I'm not foreseeing another visit."}
{"text":"I've been in DC for nearly five years now and every now and then, I still get an incredible craving for Rosita's Place.  I miss the salsa verde.  I miss the albondigas soup.  I miss the bean and cheese burritos enchilada style.  Sigh.  

Nothing on this coast even comes close to the quality, authentic Mexican food this joint offers.  It's the first stop I make whenever I return to the Valley.  

Get past the surly wait staff and the worn exterior.

This place will not let you down."}
{"text":"I had a chimichanga and holy moly it was enough for two people. Very good food. Small restaurant. Parking is limited but I'm not super familiar with this area. Heard the enchiladas are awesome too."}
{"text":"After an online argument with Julia T. about what constitutes Mexican food, I decided to try Rosita's Place, since she gave it such high praise. 

Upon walking in, I was actually pleasantly surprised at how clean the restaurant was. I was expecting more of a Carolina's type atmosphere. The lady who brought us our menus and sat us was very friendly. I thought the fish pond, while extremely odd, was a relaxing touch in the center of the dining room. 

We ordered a half-pitcher of margarita, some chips (since they were raved about) and it all came pretty much right away. The salsa was good, not great, but good. The red being the more flavorful, though hot, and the green being comparatively mild and bland. Margaritas were tasty, but verrrrrry weak. We went through the pitcher and wondered if they had much booze at all. I like the taste of tequila a lot, especially over margarita mix, but I could not taste any tequila in these. Then came the entrees, Chicken Enchiladas for her and Red Burro Enchilada style for me. I ate my food, as I will never leave something on my plate, but I was telling my girlfriend the whole time that it smelled like canned dog food. I didn't say this because I thought it was bad, or gross, but actually smelled identical to dog food. She agreed. I thought long and hard and today it came to me, it smelled like Pedigree brand. 

Overall it is a clean restaurant with great service, but unfortunately somewhat questionable food. I want to know what drugs people are on that makes them think this place has any type of quality. I'll probably go back and try something else, because it had a few things going for it, but the food is NOT one of them.

+1 for cleanliness
+1 for service
-3 for food"}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews, my friend and I went to try this out wanting good Tex-Mex. I was surprised how mediocre it was. I had the enchiladas (my typical go-to dish at Tex-Mex restaurants) and just found them very ordinary. Even the margarita just wasn't that flavorful. After having some other Mexican that was outstanding places like Milagro Grill earlier in the week, this was not up to par."}
{"text":"Came here for the menudo. Chips were hot and fresh tasting. Red menudo has a good taste. I still think Caramba's in downtown Glendale has the best menudo although this one is right up there. B-"}
{"text":"For a good hang over destination, Rosita's is the place for me. Bean and cheese burrito with green chili is the perfect stomach soother. 

Chips are a little to greasy for me, but the salsa has the perfect temp. I like it a little hotter ie (los dos molinos). The only other item I have had at Rosita's is the chimi. Also good, but if you are a bean and cheese fan, the beans are some of the best in town. That probably also means they are some of the more unhealthy beans in town."}
{"text":"Classic Americanized \"Mexican\" food with lots of unnecessary cheese. I love cheese, but not like this. They do not make their own salsas, they are canned sauces on their enchiladas for sure.

The menudo looked good, very small portion.

Everything else is bland, huge portions, crazy amounts of canned salsa and cheese."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try Rosita's place again we first tried Rosita's back in the 90s. So we looked at the menu and there was a lot of different choices but my husband really wanted to try and their red Menudo. I thought well I like menudo too so I would get a bowl also. We came in and there were a few tables available so we sat down and about 10 minutes later a huge party sat at the table behind us and it was incredible noisy. So we ended up moving and placed our order for two menudos with the pata (cow hoof). So our waitress brings us fresh fried chips red and green salsa. She brought out our Menudo but they were missing the pata  (cow hoof). So we ended up eating it was good but the Menudo really wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. I don't care for HUGE amount of hominy. The bowl had about 80 per-cent hominy.  I think they serve menudo everyday so it seemed like it was on the stove for quite some time and was at a point where it was overcooked. The waitress was very nice considering the huge crowd that showed up she brought us the pata (cow hoof) in a separate Bowl which was very nice of her. Personally I would not come back specifically for menudo but would try another dish. And I always say if service is good that is good enough for me to return to try out another dish. I want to go back for tacos or enchiladas!  The fresh fried chips are so delicious!"}
{"text":"The hours are wrong for Sunday. Beware. The food is wonderful but yelp is posting the wrong hours on Sundays. I'm here at 7pm and this amazing restaurant is closed.
I am sad"}
{"text":"I'm mexican. I grew up on mexican food made by women from mexico. Rosita's is amazing, authentic, and exactly what you want a mexican restaurant to be.

The tamales and enchiladas are particularly outrageous. 

Do yourself the favor of a Rosita's visit."}
{"text":"If you happen to drive a long way just to find yourself at the Barrio Cafe, on a Monday afternoon, and then notice the sign that says they are closed on Monday's, then I've got a great solution for you.

Head south-east my friend, over to Rosita's.  This is a great little 'hole in the wall' eatery.  I wasn't disappointed, and neither was the group I had in tow.  Their re-fried beans were so creamy and flavour-ful.  Yeah, that's right, I used a 'u' in flavour, because they're that good.

Next time I'm in the area, I plan on giving the frozen horchata with coconut rum a taste.

Be forewarned, the place is small, so if there is a group of cackling hens at the table behind you doing tequila shooters, it will make for a vexing dining experience."}
{"text":"This is the real-deal Mexican food in Arizona. (Not to be confused with Rosita's local chain of restaurants.) Home-cooked goodness. Freshly cooked chips, spicy red and green salsa. Try the chicken chilie relleno or a green chili burro enchilada style.  For you meat purists, check out the sauteed beef burro or the carnitas burro(!). It's all soooo good - not a bad item on the menu. Go to Rosita's Place - you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"So delicious! Their salsas, tacos, enchiladas are excellent!

The price is so reasonable. If you want great mexican food in a nice environment, I recommend Rosita's Place."}
{"text":"I visited Phoenix a few years ago for a gig (coming from LA). Had another musician friend who lived there turn me on to this place - awesome! Love the food and the divey ambience. If you're looking for fancy go somewhere else. If you're looking for authentic quality food this is the place. Absolutely delicious and I remember it still after 5+ years."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place didn't taste as great as we heard it tasted. It reminded me of Filibertos Mexican Food."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Great chips, freshly made and hot. The mole was great, fantastic buros, enchiladas and tostadas.
Beer was served cold.
Service was a bit lacking and we ended up asking another server to tend to our needs.
The piped in music was too loud for low key conversation.
However the food is done well. Not much to look at from the outside but very warm and inviting in."}
{"text":"I went after I arrived to Phoenix for 1st time ever.  I eat a lot of Mexican so I feel I have a palette for good food.  It was good, chips were fresh but could taste the oil on them.  I ordered the green chili enchilada combination and it was HUGE.  It was good and I would definitely return especially after only paying $10.  I have a hard one believing its the best in Phoenix.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I was craving Tamales for 2 days, so I typed in tamales in Phoenix and a list of 10 Best Places for Tamales in Metro Phoenix came up and Rosita's Place was # 8, I picked it because it was closest to my job, so after work hopped in the car called to order  1/2 dozen of Red Pork Tamales, they said 20 minutes got there 25 minutes but had to wait another 5 minutes.
¬†
Easy to find, 1st thing we notice parking kind of sucks had to park in the back, no back entrance. Open the door and a smell of bleach or cleaning products overwhelmed me I thought to myself I'm glad I ordered to go.¬† The smell could have been because there was a wishing pond with the virgin Mary, who knows.
¬†
Staff was nice, we ordered a bag of chips to.

The chips where a little stale, boo.
The Tamales well I LOVED the Masa, the flavor is Yumlicious... Not to hard, not to soft. It's red in coloring.
The size was pretty decent, nice and big.
Even amount of Masa and Meat which I loved.
The meat on the other hand well was dry and didn't have much sauce all the sauce is in the masa.
They have kick to them, but a nice kick. You feel the heat after eating a few bites.
They come with sauce on the side, nice and thick sauce, good flavor. I poured it over the Tamale and yet still had dry meat.
¬†
Overall I was happy and satisfied with my Tamale.¬† I was thinking maybe they are not fresh that's why the meat was dry, but that's okay it did the job.

I would say give it a try. ¬†¬†
On a scale from 1-5 
Masa 5
Meat 3
Size 5
Sauce 4
Chips 2

While I was there I saw they won for best Menudo a few years ago, so I will be back for that....

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
I ordered 1 Red Menudo for the hubby and 1 White one for me to go of course. 
¬†
I was surprised on how they packed it very well in a plastic container so no way that was spilling all over my car like before from other places.
¬†

It came with all the fixings, crushed red peppers, oregano, cilantro, Green Onions and White Onions all in sparte on containers which I loved. Oh yea and lemons of course..
I'm from Los Angeles and they never gave Menudo with Lemons only Limes and it was VERY hard to find white¬† Menudo but not here in Arizona which I love.
¬†
I noticed the harmony was at the bottom of both containers than the tripes. I'm more of a harmoy girl so I had to transfer the tripes in a seprate bowl then add the harmony juice than tripes... The Tripes was not to thick but was cut in big squares.
¬†
They both had different flavors and they both were greasy, especially the red one. To greasy for me, but it did the trick.
The red one was not spicy at all and is good for those who don't like spice as for me I need my spice.
The white didn't quite have the menudo taste I tasted the tripe and that's all.
The harmony had seeds which I'm not use to but tasted good.
¬†
So overall on a scale to 1 -5 I give the 
white menudo 3
red menudo 3
¬†
But I'm not done with this place now I got to try a combo plate but I hear they are known for their Chimecungas must try that too. So see you next time."}
{"text":"A vivir group of us came here to celebrate a birthday. This place is a little hole in the wall... But it is doing something right if it draws big crowds.
We ordered the shrimp enchilada, beef golden tacos, machaca tacos, green chilli tamales, and the chicken chimichanga.
Every item was pretty good with the best spice. I love their hot and spicy red and green salsa with their homemade chips."}
{"text":"Potato tacos???

I ordered the ground beef taco and it came with potato.  There's a ground beef order with potato seperate from the original ground beef but since they all come with potatoes why bother putting it as an option at all?? 

Better tacos at filibertos at the same cost without potato."}
{"text":"I drive by Rosita's all the time-- and have never stopeed to go in... until 2 days ago and I am so glad I did.  It looks really tiny from McDowell but actually it is a pretty decent size.  I ordered the good ol standby: beef taco and cheese enchilada and rice.  I was very pleased with my meal.  It was affordable and tasty.  I will go back again.  The only drawback is the pond inside-- things like that skeeve me out. Service was normal, food came quickly (like most Mexican food places) and the chips were good- warm when delivered and the salsa was great!"}
{"text":"The food was really good but their beans and rice side for a plate is ridiculously priced. The service was horrible! Waited forever get a table because it said please wait to be seated then to be told go pick out what table you want. Took almost 15 mins to get chips. And our waitress was rude and didn't check on us once until it was time to pay. She didn't ask if we wanted refills or a box for the 3$ beans and rice we got."}
{"text":"Funny reading some of these reviews and I wonder are they really fans of Mexican food?  This place is awesome (food), sure the service could be better and if this place were in a better building it would ROCK for date nights.  Green Chile beef burrito is to die for, nice kick, lots of sauce and very good with an egg and beans.  

Now for those who knocked their beans and rice, unless you make them all your life, this place makes them PERFECT...  I've tried their ground beef and potato tacos, good compared to other places I've tried.  

The best menudo in town, unless your parents make it.   Prices here are not bad and I've never go wrong.  This place is very close comparison to Tee-Pee which is very good also."}
{"text":"I went to Rosita's place for the first time to celebrate national tequila day, most excellent! I have never noticed this restaurant, let alone eaten here before. The restaurant is a bit odd, with the waitresses wearing little costumes (I am surprised this is still a thing anywhere). The food, however was pretty tasty. I tried the horchata with booze... very sweet and delicious. Their margs are fairly standard, but large. For food, I had their wonderfully delicious cheese crisp (and trust me, I've had some bad cheese crisps elsewhere, it is possible) and a combo which included a taco and an enchilada. The taco was nothing special, but the enchiladas were tasty and had a nice spicy sauce on top. Portions were large and prices were small, can't complain about that. My friend got the carnitas burrito, which she didn't really love ( I didn't try it, so I can't really comment). I would definitely return here."}
{"text":"I had Menudo rojo... It was good. Service is great, food came fast and fresh, sauces could be a little bit hotter.
Price is acceptable and there are lots of parking spots."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I came here on a bad night but the food was so bad! I ordered the two taco combination plate. The tacos were \"ground beef\" which I didn't mind until it looked like the nasty consistency of baby food mixed with whatever Jack in the box puts in the tacos. My husband ordered a bean chimichanga and the beans were so bland and the tortilla was soggy and not crispy at all. The rice was super bland and had no flavor. The salsa was weird. It had a strange smokiness to it which I wasn't expecting. Even the chips was bland! I'm not sure what the heck was going on tonight as my husband and I chose this restaurant to try based on Yelp reviews and pictures posted. The food was so bad that I can't even go back and give it another chance."}
{"text":"Literally everything here is spicy. It all tastes great but the purgatory I through after is not worth it. I should at least be able to order a not bhole destroying option."}
{"text":"The tasty cheese crisp app was 4 or 5 stars and chips with salsa were 3, otherwise the review would've been zero stars. I think we came to Rosita's on a bad night for the servers, waitresses and chefs. Because my two friends from Phoenix didn't listen to my advice about dinner plans, we ended up here. Also my buddies are not professional foodies but they knew about this place from a good looking female co-worker. I learned about this later in the dinner process.  

Once you walk in to the place, you get the feeling it will be an authentic Mexican dining experience. The place has some Mexican families dining in which tells you that most likely they're serving great food. I'm not sure what happened but we did not get any smile or welcome from our waitresses. Although we were pleasant, I guess. We ordered many dishes because we were three hungry dudes. The best by far was the cheese crisp. It's like the thinnest cheese pizza without red sauce; it was so fresh so crispy and so tasty. You have to get this, if you ever come here. I wish we got only the cheese crisp, the chips and salsa and we left. Two waitresses came and they seemed to hate any questions about the menu. The menu was endless and we needed some clarifications but anyways.  

I miss me some taquitos, so I got carne asada, fish and chicken tacos.  I think my friends got tampiquena and machaca. Speaking of tacos, chicken tacos were very bland, filled with dry chicken mainly. The carne asada tacos were basically lackluster ground beef and missing the basic main ingredients or toppings of a good beef taco. I have no memory of the fish taco whatsoever. I mean, you can make much better tacos at home. They were all disappointing. On top of that, our waitresses seemed very unhappy in general that night. 

Rosita's staff and management, thank you for your efforts; your establishment is appreciated. But you need to work on providing better quality food and maybe a smile when you serve the food."}
{"text":"I have a love for this place that goes beyond food since it is my go to place after a long night out. I dig their posole and green chile burros. They have a good egg and potato burro but I am not a fan of the whole menu, much like Los Dos is known for their pork roast and nothing else really, this place is all about the burro and posole. That isnt a bad thing when they deliver so well on them. Their rice and beans are pretty solid as well."}
{"text":"Cheese Enchiladas, rice and beans .  Excellent choice!   Hot sauce so hot and had no flavor , just hot.  Chips are fresh and hot but they neglect to tell you 1.00 charge.  Just a bit deceiving, should at least advise the consumer."}
