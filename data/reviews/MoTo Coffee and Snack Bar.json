{"text":"Finally got to visit this small and delightful spot out on the fringe of Dundas West. It was a surprise for K, who needed some good food and drink after a rough week at work. She was delighted. The menu is a collection of small dishes, all with an Italian theme. We shared four in total and K had two cocktails. We started with Ricotta Toast and Arancini, followed by a single sardine. All three were really, really good - tell your friends good, in fact, which is what I have been doing. We finished with a dark chocolate zeppoli; it was an almost perfect evening. K's cocktails were sublime (I don't drink but I taste), the first a Bourbon Sour and the second the Monkey Shoulder Old Fashioned. The owner, bartender and chef all took time to make sure we understood what was available and what they recommended, without being over-friendly. The interior is sparse but not austere, and cozy as all get out. I don't ant to say too much, because you should just go and discover for yourself how nice a simple evening can be.  Currently only open in the evenings, there are plans to open during the day for coffee. The owner is a well regarded barista, so I really cannot wait until then."}
{"text":"Heard about this delightful spot from a friend.  A group of us went to experience it this past Saturday.    In short, loved it!  First of all the folks that run the Moto are sooo passionate about what they are doing.  Really a treat to experience.  Just ask questions and you'll get such great info and really learn how much they care about what they serve to their customers.  That in itself is worth going to experience at Moto.  It's a casual atmosphere.  Great bar to sit at and chat to your friends or the bartender.  Menu is made up of small dishes (dare I say Italian tapas?) which are great for sharing and sampling.  The pasta of the day was fresh and so wonderfully flavoured.  Mushroom Fettuccine .... the words cannot describe the deliciousness.  Friends had the charcuterie board... and raved.  You have to try the pickled grapes and the in-house mustard.  Top quality ingredients only!  Simply and beautifully presented.  Others had the steak tartar.... a fabulous take on a classic.  And then the drinks!  I had a bourbon sour.  Had never had one before.  Will be ordering that again!  But I'll be torn because I'll want to try the other drinks on the menu or..... a custom one!  Just ask for a custom drink and the bar tenders will spontaneously create something for you.  Chances are you'll be very pleased!  Go check them out.  And watch for brunch coming up!!!"}
{"text":"Pasta and poutine was incredible! Also had some of the best beer I've ever had in my life! The ambience was great and the food all looked absolutely breathtaking. All this being said, why four stars? Well, when you sit down at a restaurant with friends or family, it's usually to converse with your friends or family. Our waiter could not shut up to save his life. He was extremely nice and explained everything well, but would not stop talking. Very annoying, but a small price to pay for amazing food. Come ASAP for amazing food, but pre-game before so you can tune out your waiter."}
{"text":"This is a cozy spot with delicious food, a plethora of drink options and fantastic atmosphere.  The staff are chatty and efficient. The food takes a little while but is worth the wait. It is fresh and artfully presented.  The brunch is decadent, especially the blueberry panettone French toast!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Late night treats and great selection of beers and cocktails. Really cozy spot."}
{"text":"I just spent a couple hours with Dave and Steve knocking back 'tenders choice cocktails.  Amazing experience.  Bar none;  these guys got you covered.  Want a delicious cocktail? Covered.  Wanted good conversation? Done. Music? As long as Dave's cell phone is in the bar. Check.  Food? I challenge anyone to find a menu choice that doesn't either satisfy or surprise you. This is a place you need to experience.  It will become a part of your routine."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch for the first time. Absolutely amazing. Had the roti and scrambled eggs in an amatriciana sauce. Never had something like this in the city. So good"}
