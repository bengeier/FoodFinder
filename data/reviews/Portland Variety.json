{"text":"I tried the Berliner donut which is a sugar donut with a vanilla bean custard inside. It was very good and not too sweet despite the sugar coating on the outside. The custard was rich and there were visible vanilla bean seeds so the flavour was good."}
{"text":"Very clean and cool design, close to home, it's one of my favorite spot for brunch, coffee and breakfast!"}
{"text":"So, I went to Portland Variety a week ago for my birthday. 2 of the cocktails I ordered off the menu were quite good as well as the food.  After the second drink, I kinda put my trust in my server and the bartender and asked for a recommendation on a spirit-forward cocktail using either bourbon, rye, or mezcal. I ended up receiving a Bourbon Sour, which is pretty far from a spirit-forward cocktail for which I kindly asked about.   The server was kind enough to take it back and get me another drink. He comes by saying they'll make me a \"Bourbon Smash\" but I'm not entirely clear on what it is.  When I receive the drink, I notice immediately it wasn't what I asked for. Breaking down the ingredients of my drink in my head, it seems that they just added basil, dropped in some ice, shook it up and effectively recycled the rest of my previous drink. I didn't see it happen because I don't watch the staff cook/bartend as I trusted them to handle it but they insulted my intelligence by recycling what I just sent back.   Based on that, I cannot recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've had it with this place.  Decent food most of the time but last time it was an incorrect recipe that ended in a horrendous experience.  Today I was told I could only get a side salad if I was eating in.  For take out I'd have to pay $13 for a full salad.... And they don't offer soup in the summer (I was also told).  Can't I get a damned soup and sandwich here?  Yeeesh.  Can it be that much more expensive to buy smaller salad takeout boxes?"}
{"text":"I've walked past this place several times, not realizing how expansive the restaurant actually is. The front seen through the street-facing window is deceptive, revealing only the cafe-bar and sparse seating, as well as an assortment of pastries and muffins. The restaurant actually stretches far into the back, with a wide selection of seats, and an alcohol bar.  The aesthetic of the restaurant is bright and cheery, with pretty stained-glass artworks on the wall, offset by rustic caged lightbulbs hanging above; an interesting contrast that works well.  I must dedicate a sentence to how accomodating, friendly, and strikingly attractive all the servers are.  I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes with cream chesse mousse and dried blueberries (we came for brunch), which were so absolutely perfect that I've not a single criticism.  Much recommended!"}
{"text":"Spectacular brunch, the Huevos con Chorizo excite me sexually. The staff are absolutely phenomenal, so helpful and friendly. I've never been disappointed here!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service. Brunch is one of the best I've had in dt.   The French toast in Nutella pralines is to die for. The eggs Benedict was alright."}
{"text":"Really liked this place: from d√©cor to service to food (portion sizes are great). It's a tapas place and they recommend that you share the dishes. In the past, a lot of tapas places I went to gave you tiny portions and you felt like you had to order a to get a good meal. Not the case with PV. The sizes were very impressive, especially for the price that you pay, so hopefully that wont change. Their cocktails are masterpieces and again are priced very reasonably. We had a cocktail of prosecco, gin and real fruit puree. They serve it in a nice flute type champagne glass with no stem. The dishes we shared were: gluten-free cheese balls (nice as a start with a cocktail) - they were so fluffy and delicious. Then we shared a wild mushroom arugula salad - again the portion was great for sharing between the two people. There were lots of mushrooms in the dish, which was great. Then came the eggplant - it's a very nice Spanish dish. After we had cod with potatoes mash which came with tasted baguette slices. It was a spicy dish but I removed red peppers from the dish and it was fine. Lastly we shared grilled octopus with chorizo - again the sauce was on a spicy side, but the dish itself was delicious. The only thing I would suggest for them is to maybe go easy on the salt a bit, but other than that everything was different and delicious. For dessert we shared their mini donuts with vanilla cream which were served with thick dark chocolate to dip in, delish!   Service was very attentive and they were always cleaning our table and refilling our water. At first we sat near the window but decided to move because of the A/C. They offered to turn down the A/C, which was nice of them. However later the A/C was on again, so that's why we thought it'd be better to move.   The place was busy on a Tuesday but the noise level was normal.   I would come back to that place again, even if just for their cocktails!"}
{"text":"so the food is ok. but the service is so crap. i keep giving portland a chance because i am addicted to this one tequila bong drink they have. however eveytime i try to get the check it somehow takes forever for someone to come with it. The waiters and waitresses NEVER make eye contact with you when you're trying to get their attention. It's absurd."}
{"text":"I have been stopping here every morning this week because the cappuccinos are amazing. Worth waking up an hour earlier for."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday for brunch with my kids and ordered the pancakes as we are avid pancake eaters! When it came to the table, it looked awfully small and considered ordering another serving to feed my 2 kids and myself + husband. Shortly after, we had a couple next to us order the same pancakes, which were distinctively way larger in size than what we just ordered couple of minutes ago. I politely asked the server why are my pancakes are not that size (table next to us) and mine is so small it could be considered as blinis (for caviar). I paid for full size pancakes, just like everyone else at this restaurant. She responded \"some of the kitchen staff are training\". Ok so their training their staff. I saw an expediter, manager, etc working that time I came in. That means it had to go through several \"checkpoints\" and no one noticed the difference until it finally arrived at my table? Our server, being the last checkpoint to notice that these pancakes were embarrassingly small. She literally served the same pancakes few minutes after putting ours down on the table! There was no compassion at all and dismissed the fault with an offering of a pastry on our way out. I opened our paper bag to see what kind of pastry she compensated us for, and instead got a rocka$$ hard cookie that was just the icing on the cake of our experience at portland variety."}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday evening for Dinner & drinks. Very cozy place with fun vibe. Cocktails were inventive & delicious. Ordered a pitcher of Sangria also which was also very tasty. The two of us shared 4 dishes since it is Tapas style and enjoyed each one. Grilled octopus is a must try. I Would definitely stop by if in the area again for drinks and/or a bite to eat."}
{"text":"It's a really good place for  afterwork drink/Saturday night out. Me and my husband came here for fast dinner on Saturday, at 7pm restaurant was half full and most part of tables were reserved in advance. Food here served as tapas, every meal is made to share. We had home made ricotta (was really good), beef carpaccio (in my carpaccio top 5 now) and crockets (good). House ref wine was really good.  We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I freakin' love Portland Variety. Great food, gorgeous decor and sweet staff.   First off, the decor is one of the prettiest in Toronto (in my opinion). Think marble counters, a mix of wood & marble top tables, a skylight, and whimsical chalkboard drawings. It's airy looking but still cozy feeling.   At the front of house, they have a great variety of tasty takeaway baked goods (cookies, croissants, etc) and readymade food (yogurt, sandwiches, salads, etc) & coffee drinks. Their espresso is one of my favourites in the city - I usually order a latte. Also, points for having decaf! If you get one thing from Portland Variety, make it a chocolate chip cookie. You will have dreams about it later on and may struggle to contain your foodgasm in public (I speak from experience).   As far as breakfast goes, I've had the bacon egg cheddar croissant and the breakfast burrito with egg, monterey jack, homemade chorizo & salsa. Both were fantastic. The bacon egg cheddar croissant is buttery, flaky, fluffy.. basically everything I've dreamed of a croissant sandwich being. If you're looking for something with a little kick, I recommend going for the breakfast burrito.   Brunch service doesn't start until 11 am, but you can order from the cafe at the front and eat in the back before then.  I'll definitely be popping by Portland Variety for brunch and dinner & cocktails in the very near future."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favourite places to eat but it has really gone down hill. The staff is super unfriendly and no one seems to care that you're there costumer. I would never recommend it to anyone. Simple mannerisms go a long way but no one should have to tell them that... they are in the service industry after all."}
{"text":"A cheaper alternative to BarChef if you're looking for great cocktails. The staff are friendly, but I haven't checked out the menu."}
{"text":"When dining with a group of 4 or more, a longer wait to be seated and a lengthier amount of time for your food to arrive is expected however, 50 minutes to be seated and approximately another 45 min for food is a bit excessive.  When looking into the dining room, there were several tables that we could see that would accommodate our group of 7.  There were several small groups of 2-3 and about 3 groups of 4-5 that were seated before us.  In the end, they ended up just putting 2 tables together ... something that could've been done a lot earlier.    The majority of the meals were great and the chocolate chip cookies were fantastic.  The pancakes were very rich, while remaining lite and fluffy.  The French Toast was excellent and not overly dense (as they can sometimes be at other restaurants when they excessively drench the bread in too much egg).  The Eggs Benedict were a bit of a let down.  The poached eggs were quite tiny and the ham was minimal for a $14 plate (if I recall the price correctly).   The wait staff was great! Very attentive and extremely accommodating.    Overall, the continuous wait at almost every stage of the experience was too much to overlook when considering that some of the meals were good, not great.  Food:  -lemon ricotta pancakes x 2 -french toast with strawberry and cream -eggs Benedict x 2 -ham and Grier omelet  -Bravas potatas x 2   Drinks:  -green tea -latte  -cranberry juice"}
{"text":"I had my wallet stolen out of my bag on the patio at Portland Variety last week. While the hostess was incredibly helpful the other staff seem uninterested in finding video footage, including the manager who never returned my phone call. The patio is incredibly dark at night with no lighting other than candles and I believe this is how the thieves were able to walk right on and steal my wallet without anyone else noticing. Please be wary while sitting on this patio."}
{"text":"Never coming back to this place. I love going to new coffee shops but this was such a disappointment. They have the rudest staff here. I forgot to tell the barista skimmed milk please as I was ordering and I requested it at the espresso bar. She scowled at me and said I already made it, meanwhile all she had done was steam the milk. The espresso hadn't been poured yet or anything. I apologized and she reluctantly steamed the skim milk. It wasn't like it was busy or anything, I was the only one ordering. Then she proceeded to throw the milk into my latte and toss my drink to me. She literally dumped the steamed milk into my cup, I've never seen a batista dump not even pour milk into a cup.  Nothing special about the beans here, super light flavour and didn't taste any different from a latte from a generic coffee store."}
{"text":"This place has the best chocolate chip cookie in the city (along with Le Gourmand). I've only been here for pastries and coffee but it's not too crowded and the service at the counter has always been friendly. Lots of seating and great location."}
{"text":"Saw a lot of good Pinterest style pictures online of this place and it attracts my friend and I to check this place out. Located in Fashion District of King Street, the upscale aesthetics and friendly servers make this an excellent place for business lunches.  Came here for lunch and the food is amazing. We ordered the AAA Ribeye Steak sourdough sandwich with caramelized onion, and blue cheese. The steak is definitely AAA as the meat was tender and juicy. Though the onion and blue cheese sounds like simple garnish it truly brought out the flavour of the steak and complimented the taste of the sourdough bread. Accompanied with the Warm Mushroom Arugula Salad it was a delicious and balanced meal of luscious meat, plenty of carbs, and a fresh bed of vegetables. Also, their cocktails are also truly delightful."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place on Sat night because all the others were busy. If I new then what I know after eating there we would have left when we saw the restaurant was empty at 8:30 and all the others had at least an hour wait.  The food was okay for tapas.  The service. The worst ever I have experienced. Our service was no where to be found when our food arrived which was bland. We were looking to spice up the carpaccio with some salt and lemon.  We were having difficulty with the credit card machine. Where our service made a comment about how dumb we were to not be able to figure it out which was heard from the table beside us. Who proceeded to tell us and to tell us of there horrific experience with the same female waitress who served them coffees.  I then gave her an earful for treating customers the way she had been and telling her she was in the wrong business. I then called over the manager to voice our complaint as the table beside also told him his experience. He offered to take care of us next time. Right, like we were ever coming back. Horrible, horrible experience for 4 ladies who decided to drive to Toronto and check out the restaurant scene.  Can't understand how they remain open.  Good Luck."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The decor makes you feel like you are in Europe with the marble tables and bare brick walls. The service was stellar, from having my settings reset after i came back from the washrooms to friendly hostesses. I love open kitchens and this one is about as open as it gets as you walk right by on your way to the table! The food though is the highlight. Started with the fish crudo which was very flavourful and super fresh, and finished with the best octopus Ive ever had. Seriously, try the octopus, perfectly tender and grilled. If I had more time I would have tried more cocktails but the Local 587 is their twist on a classic french 75 but with different fruits! I had the grapefruit and rosemary and cant wait to try whatever they come up with next!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Christmas Eve, unfortunately it was a weekday so they were serving from their lunch menu. The decor is very pretty and the floor to ceiling windows created a great, warm atmosphere.  Food - We had the Roasted Flank Steak Sandwich, Ricotta Gnocchi and Beef Carpaccio to share. The food was good but it was on the salty side. Beignets for dessert were great to finish the meal.   Service - We made a reservation for 11:30, and was one of the first people there for the lunch service. As the place filled up, service did get spotty but we were having a good time and the atmosphere was nice so we didn't notice it as much. Overall, the food wasn't spectacular for the price but the ambiance and decor really pulled it all together."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for brunch. First of all, I cannot believe how a brunch place can be so crowded and loud on a Sunday morning... Totally destroyed my peaceful mood. My friend and I were seated quickly, but when led to the seat, I wasn't even able to make out our tiny table amongst all the people and winter jackets. The server took our juice order and didn't come back for our brunch order for another 5 min. I ordered the hazelnut french toast which was actually yummy, and my friend ordered the lemon pancakes which was also flavourful. Unfortunately we had to yell in order for the other to hear the entire meal. I would recommend going with a larger group of people just because the sheer volume of 6 people talking will override that of 2 people. Food is great, but service is terrible and ambience is loud. If you prefer a quaint brunch, don't go."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and love the food but they had this one guy in a suit drop off food at our table and he looked lost, I was appalled to find out he was the new manager, Tim was his name, they need to rid themselves of pompous managers like him. He was rude and had no concern for my table, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm pretty convinced their chocolate chip cookies are laced with magical pixie dust. They are out of this world and loaded with gooey chocolate chunks. I am addicted."}
{"text":"Not a good experience here today.  Server was terrible,  seemed like he wasn't bothered to be there or provide any level of acceptable service.  Wouldn't accommodate a substitution for a friend and didn't offer any suggestions.  Really poor experience and the food itself was just ok."}
{"text":"3.5 Had a great night with friends here. The environment is nicely dim, soft, clean and casual enough to sit long and enjoy a variety of dishes, wine and coffee. They serve tapas style with a bit of Spanish, Mexican and middle eastern mix. It a bit of a curious bag, so it ended up with some hit and misses. The hits, the chilli shrimp, smoke trout salad, frites, carpaccio. Misses, cheese ball (oily, not at all similar to brazilian queijo) grilled octopus (very overcooked). The service was a bit slow, but when served attentive and unpretentious. Good selection of wine. Expect to spend about $40 plus per person."}
{"text":"Friday night. Four friends. Reservations made but not necessary. We were all very very impressed with the service. Two servers for our table which made us feel almost vip. They were very attentive. Portions were big, perfect to share between 2-4 people. Dinner for four with a bottle of wine and beers was about $80 per person, all in. I will definitely come back to try the rest of the menu and their cocktails. The ambiance is very cozy and romantic. Great place to take your date or chill at the beautiful marble bar with friends. Well decorated and layed out.   Drinks: Try the Silk Oak 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon - smooth, bold and great with the type of hearty food served. Also try the hibiscus beer and the pumpkin one. For someone who doesn't drink beer, I was very impressed. My new favourite.   Crochettes - deep fried goodness melted in your mouth, just perfect.  Patas bravas - who knew potatoes could be so exciting. Sourdough bread - grilled pieces as well as soft sourdough bread alongside soft butter.  Mushroom salad - light and full of flavour with a few types of fancy mushrooms, arugala and cheese shavings. Porchetta (if you like pork) - crispy skin, some fat. I wasn't a fan but I usually only eat bacon and pork belly.  Eggplant dish - had a fantastic tomatoe sauce with some cinnamon, giving it a distinct flavor of awesomeness.   Burnt cheesecake - it's cheesecake! Can't go wrong :)"}
{"text":"Came here for some snacks and drinks with a friend. I would give it a 3.5 - I would definitely go back  but it's not the best I've ever had. We ordered the cheese puffs, house made ricotta with honey, patatas bravas and the grilled octopus and the little donut things for dessert. The service was okay - felt really rushed toward the end by the waitress (it didn't seem like anybody was waiting for a table since the patio was not full). I will come back here to try some of the other dishes and report back :) PS they are also open during the morning and have pastries and coffee and other breakfast items.  The chocolate chip cookies are delicious. My only complaint is that twice I have shown up on a Sat morning at least half an hour after the posted opening time to find that they weren't open! When I walked by over an hour later - still closed!"}
{"text":"This is a great cafe if you are looking for brunch which they serve all week or just a take out coffee.  It is one of the few places that actually sell Portuguese custard tarts which is something everyone should try at least once in their life.  The take out counter layout was a little confusing but that is just a design flaw.  Staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Location: King and Portland (just east of Bathurst) on the southeast corner. Super convenient locations. Many cabs go buy this area.  Facility: Intimate, romantic, elegant, upscale. I was very impressed (and surprised) to see this little charm when we randomly choose a place to eat. Decor and ambiance is perfect for couples and small groups. Patio space is available. Washroom as individual stalls (very clean) and private - no men/womens. We arrived for dinner on a Saturday night around 9pm and were seated immediately.   Food Quality & Price: Dishes are tapas style (community dishes where you order a few and share with people at the table). I went with a close girlfriend and we split 3 dishes between us and were quite full. Prices for these dishes range from $4 - $45.  Drinks are pricey ($14 average for a cocktail). We ordered the bone marrow with parsley, cassava frites, and beef tenderloin carpaccio. Everything was a hit. I could go back for seconds and thirds of that carpaccio. The food was just divine! At the end of the night, we split a bill around $30 for two people. Amazing!!  Service: Incredible!! We never had empty or even close to empty glasses!! It didn't matter who our server was, any server who walked by would top off our glasses. And even our own server, Tara, was just lovely. She was attentive, efficient and friendly. Never intrusive, but always nearby if we needed her. During such a busy time of week, we never felt that the staff were \"stressed\" or \"too busy\" for us.   Overall: Colour me impressed! I cannot wait to return for a romantic date night with my husband!! You HAVE to order the beef tenderloin carpaccio. And though other's say the dress code is casual, on weekend evenings, I notice a lot of ladies and gents in business casual or even cocktail attire. You can get away with both. I hope Portland Variety keeps their prices/service consistently this well in the future."}
{"text":"Just had the most amazing chicken peri peri sandwich with Gouda and sweet pears! Best sandwich in the city!!"}
{"text":"The brunch was amazing. I love lemon flavoured anything and the lemon pancakes were awesome sauce.   My friend got the eggs benedict type thing and the waiter initially didnt want to sub pork for something else but after I was insistent that he should be allowed given that he cant eat pork for religious reasons he did so my friend got some avocado instead.   I've also stopped by for some of their pintxos, they were quite nice (not mind blowing) but the idea is amazing. We were just walking around queen/king west and stopped by, grabbed two and shared them standing up. Little bites that take 2 min to eat but are a great way to get a quick, fancy snack."}
{"text":"If it was possible would have rated it zero star! Worse service ever! Dishes are so small and too pricy, our server was in such a rush and pushing his choices from the menu. 10 minutes I see a dish which I hadn't order came, I explained I didn't order this dish and he was insisting I did. Then it is time to pay, my friend told him she doesn't want the receipt, his answer was leave it on the table! I WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK THERE! There are plenty of good options on King St with way better service!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. They don't have a lot of variety for lunch but my egg wrap was good. I also had a gateau. Would recommend the pastries!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and everything they do.  The staff are great and manage to create a real community feeling here, something you don't get much of in this neighbourhood.  This is my go to spot for caffeine and a take-away breakfast (so many great options) and it's also an incredible dinner spot.  I'm not ashamed to say I've had days where I've eaten every single meal here."}
{"text":"Had a great time here.  Had a few bites from the tapas bar (yay for shishito peppers!) and was easily convinced  into staying for dinner. Standouts: Bone marrow, a Maple/Bourbon cocktail, grilled octopus (it was the highlight for me).  Also had the striploin, cooked to med rare perfection.  Service was incredibly down to earth, which is nice given the area and concept."}
{"text":"Good food, great decor, excellent cocktails. Did I mention the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating.   This place does the small things right; a taste of the old world. An attendant will fold your napkin when you use the restroom. They feature a well balanced wine list. Their cocktails are creative and whimsical.   The food was a 3/5 but everything else was 5/5."}
{"text":"Been there for a brunch in the late summer, the patio is beautiful and the food (biryani) I ordered was really good. I went back for coffee breaks and treats from time to time after. I like the atmosphere at this place. It's really enjoyable and relaxing. Coffee and treats are pretty fresh every time I go."}
{"text":"http://jentalkstoomuch.com/2016/08/portland-variety-insulting-people-one-pregnant-woman-at-a-time/"}
{"text":"The food here is very lackluster, not much flavor and very pretentious prices. Got the \"Crispy\" Cornish hen sandwich which had absolutely zero flavor, and was not crispy at all. Not sure how this place remains in business."}
{"text":"Good pastries but not good service. Today was my third time visiting here on a weekday morning for take out. Each time the person assisting me is pretty rude. I really like their pasteis de nata cause it is so flaky and fresh. I wanted 5, and a chocolate croissant. So he said bag okay and already started to put it In a bag. Then I said can I have a box? Since I was going to bring this to my family. He did it but kind of gave a look. Then I said he can use that bag he opened for the croissant. So he did. I realized he only thought I wanted 1 pasteis de nata. Then I said I had wanted 5. Then he had to figure out if he could fit it in the mini box he picked. The second time I went, it was also stone cold service until I asked if the pastries were baked there. Then we started a conversation. I am not looking for a lot of talking or a smile, but they don't have to look so pissed off they have to help me. For regulars, they definitely brighten up a lot.   The information I did receive was that pastries are made fresh every morning."}
{"text":"Come in around opening time if you're planning to go for brunch. I arrived coincidentally at 10 on Sunday and there was a huge crowd waiting for opening for seats - luckily it is spacious enough for everyone. Avocado toast was pretty good, but I prefer the one from Fring's more."}
{"text":"I love this place during the week. Great salads and world's best avocado sandwich.  However-  drives me mad that they take away their regular grab and go fare on weekends.  I want an avocado sandwich everyday and your brunch menu does nothing to make up for the loss!  Please do more to accommodate regulars on everyday of the week :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been in a number of times and am finally getting around to writing my review, so this will cover a few of my visits.  I was actually at a nearby restaurant on Portland having lunch and had finished up and was heading south, when I realized that I needed caffeine! I saw Portland Variety on the southwest corner of King and Portland so decided to give it a try.  I had intended on just a cappuccino but ended up having an almond pastry.  The cappuccino was great, and of course the foam art was spot on....but man....the almond pastry!!! Lots of butter in that bad boy for sure, but it was sooo good! I caught a glimpse of the cocktail menu as well and knew I would be back.  My next visit(s) were over lunch and I have been lucky to sample some of the cocktails.  All of the bartenders have been very pleasant and talkative,  which in my opinion is part of the experience. I have sampled an old fashioned, a last word, and a couple of the custom cocktails including the Kentucky trail and tequila bong, which each use smoke in their prep.  For food I usually stick to the warm mushroom arugula salad and add the fish crudo, which makes for an excellent combination."}
{"text":"It's another one of those resturants that is pretty if you want to take some pictures, but that's about where it ends.  We went for in the fall, so we were able to take advantage of the terrace outside.  The menu is varied and does have some different items from your classic brunch spots in Toronto, being tapas themed.  We ordered eggplant byaldi. It was good, and I don't mind small portions like theirs, but I do believe then that the price should be adjusted. The dish was good  (although it could use more seasoning) but the toasted bread was burnt, and there was quite a bit of oil seeping through the eggplant. The waiters were friendly and welcoming, but the service was slow."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I ended up here after leaving an Italian restaurant a few doors down where we weren't served even water after 15 minutes of being seated, and I'm definitely glad we did... Everything happens for a reason, right?  Our server was wonderful and attentive, friendly and sweet. We ordered many dishes to wash away the annoyance of the prior experience... Sometimes I'm a stress eater, OK? OK.  We ordered the following:  Bone marrow Croquetas Garlic mashed potatoes Southern Fried cauliflower  Smoked Venison tartare  Grilled octopus Short angel hair Fidel seafood pasta And some beignets to fill any possible empty space we MAY have afterwards  Overall, amazing place!!"}
{"text":"Let me add my voice to the throng. Pancakes = excellent. Rarely do brunch places do something different with pancakes, but these lemon ricotta ones with blueberry compote were great. Sweet, and not overpoweringly fruity, the ricotta cuts the tartness. Real maple syrup also.  My dining companion had the fried eggs bravas, which were not bad. Definitely not a classic patatas bravas (more tomato than creamy/spicy sauce). Not sure I'd order this one again though.  The dining room is bright and airy, a pleasant space on a Sunday morning. A solid choice and I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Their cookies and pastries are really good and it's a really nice place to have a snack or stop for an afternoon tea. But the servers give it a bad rep for sure. I came in today looking to have a coffee and a snack and had to wait for 4 minutes before someone even looked our way to seat us. The girl making the coffee and pastries was extremely snobby and unfriendly. She had a stink face the whole time she was preparing our coffee and cashing us out. Like what is you're deal? You're at a damn coffee shop no need to be so miserable and arrogant. I try to avoid this place cause of their staff. They never fail to ruin my mood."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with a large group on a busy Saturday night. I would recommend the mushroom and arugula salad, kale salad, blackened ribeye, and grilled octopus. Service was decent. The atmosphere is nice, but the food isn't spectacular. I feel like it's a bit overpriced, but you're paying for the area and ambiance. I would go back to try other things from the menu."}
{"text":"Loved the pancakes for brunch. Yes loved them . Nice place, good service."}
{"text":"Nice services, great dining experience.  Brunch menu offers a big selection of tasty food. I like the  huevos. But the bakery platter is not recommended as all. We got the platter, but the server gave us two croissant and told us the other bakery are run out. But later we found out there are still other bakery. Bakery was great, but it's cheaper if you order it separately."}
{"text":"The food at this place is delicious, it all comes in tapas size, so you get to try a little bit of everything, one of my favorites is patatas bravas, they are so good.  I didn't care for the mixed drinks, the one I had and the one my friend had were watery and tasteless, so, have beer or wine.  It is very loud, so, just get used to screaming at each other to have a conversation.  Service is good enough, when they are around, but they disappear for long periods of time, this has happened the 3 times I've been there."}
{"text":"Great service and ambiance. Brunch options were pretty healthy. I made my own dish through sides: a hardy serving of bacon, 3 eggs and about half an avocado. Fair price considering my 3 eggs looked more like 5 eggs. May I add that my scrambled eggs were perfect - fluffy, full of flavour and non-greasy. Definitely will visit Portland Variety again and soon."}
{"text":"Walked into this place wanting to try it for the longest time. I was in serious need of caffeine on a Sunday afternoon. The service wasn't thr best as the barista looked disinterested in serving me but whatever I was taking my food to go. I walked in just wanting to order a latte but after paying for it I noticed the delicious looking cr√®me br√ªl√©e croissant by the pastry display and had to get that as well. I was so curious as to how it tasted like a cr√®me br√ªl√©e, I thought it was just a torched sugar crust but was pleasantly surprised to see a vanilla bean custard like filling inside of it and quite a bit of it as well not just a tiny blob but a good amount of custard filling. I throughly enjoyed the Cr√®me br√ªl√©e croissant and can't wait to go back for it again, can't say the same for the latte though. It was forgettable, maybe next time I will try the coffee."}
{"text":"I love their food and the design of the space but man, this joint cannot seem to correct their customer service!  As someone who works nearby I frequent PV. Their customer service is one of the worst I've experienced in Toronto. Every single employee is rude, slow, unhelpful and seem to the most unhappy people in general.   Portland please do something about this. This place is a recipe for success but it's such a terrible experience to encounter someone who just seems angry to serve ever customer who walks through the door."}
{"text":"Great service, food was nothing special for the price... Will choose other tapa restaurants over Portland variety next time."}
{"text":"Portland Variety is one of my favorite brunch/pastry place. They have a relaxing but stylish dining room. The brunch menu is rather healthy.. A lot of avocado dishes. Not very meaty. I love the huevos. It's a bit spicy, very flavorful. I also love their latte and brewed coffee with a piece of nice pastry. I recommend the walnut chocolate cookie and the gateau basque."}
{"text":"Hearing many good things about Portland Variety made me want to try it cfor myself. Brunch was hardly exciting after a hefty wait time we were seating in the restaurant.    The interior is nively done, marple tables, bright open space and traditional yet modern decor seem fitting for the King st. Location.  I ordered the egglant dish which included two poached eggs I found this dish to be a flavourful healthy option, it lacked excitement for me but again it is healthy and quite filling yet savoury.  My BF ordered the huevos rancheros which was most disapointing as with the many elements this dish has (beans, guac, cheese, scrambled eggs, sinced beef) nothing stood out of well seasoned or flavourful, not to sound harsh but it left me feeling like I ate a taco bell breakfast dish.  I would though go again to try the tapas at night but brunch is a no go for me."}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying that I only came in for a pastry and a coffee. The coffee was the worst I've had in Toronto (watered down) but the chocolate chip walnut cookie was the best I've ever had (from the rating, you can see which I value more). My other half had a cortado - also watered down and flavorless.  The atmosphere is, well, sort of like walking into a reality tv show produced by MTV for teens with time to spare between manicures and expensive car washes (i.e., people looked like they came in to be seen and really really cared about being seen, as opposed to wanting to be seen but looking like they don't care alla Yorkville). Personally, if I'm going to go for one or the other, I'll pick the Yorkville vibe. So, even though the dining room looked great, I haven't dined here yet. Will I? I think so. At that point, I really hope to update this review for the more positive because I kind of sort of really wanted to like this place.  P.s. Stylish yellow stools but incredibly uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I ate at Portland Variety last night, it was my third time and very disappointing. It's a bit over priced to begin with but when the food is sub par I get really annoyed. The croquettes while tasty we're cold. The beef carpaccio wholly uninspiring and bland. But the absolute worst was the clams. They were so over done it was like chewing a rubber puck. I let the waiter know but he seemed pretty clueless. He's lucky I didn't pay the bill as the service was pretty laissez faire. I have to say, pretty disappointing all the way around. Won't be going back, there are other better options around."}
{"text":"wasn't so impressed with this place.  came here after the CN Tower Climb because it was on my way to the car and I felt like I was starred down in disgust because I wasn't \"dressed nice\"   the service was alright, got our coffee refills as we requested and or order was right but it seemed as though the waitress had no desire to make small talk.  the food was decent, my friends Mexican bowl looked good. My eggs Benny wasn't great. the eggs weren't soft as requested and the hollandaise sauce was too tarty for my pallet.  definitely not a place in eager to want to return too."}
{"text":"Toronto has many great spots for brunch and Portland Varsity is one of them.  The layout and decor of the restaurant is cozy and chic. We came here in the later hour of brunch and was able to get a table of 4 right away.  The broiche French toast was thick slices topped with fresh strawberries. The toast was super light and flurry, the cream cheese was on the sweeter side for me.  For something more savory I'd recommend the Fried Egg Brava. The dish is served with thick cuts if bacon and the seasoning on the home fries is delicious. You simply can't go wrong with a hearty dish like that.  We ordered some juices, I thought it would be freshly pressed in shop  instead they were provided by \"fresh\", nonetheless they were still good juices.  The only hiccup in my experience at Portland was being served a glass with lipstick stain. Of course they replaced it immediately upon showing them, but i feel any type of food establishment shouldn't make this type of mistake to begin with."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch a few weeks ago. Had the ricotta pancakes and the patatas bravas. I also ordered a fresh juice - beet, ginger and apple I believe it was. It was good. The atmosphere is live. We walk by all the time and the space never seems empty including the day we went. We didn't have to wait long for a table, we actually went next door for ice lattes and by time we came back our table was ready.   The patatas bravas was delcious. I would recommend it. The pancakes were good, but it's too much of a very distinct flavour for me to be able to finish. It was good but too excessive. I wish I had someone to share it with but Dave isn't a pancake fan.   Since visiting I have been stopping there on the weekends for a juice from the front section."}
{"text":"I often come for dinner. My friends and I all love it. Fun atmosphere, delicious food and great drinks. Right in the heart of the entertainment district. Perfect spot to eat before a night out with friends."}
{"text":"I went there on Sunday morning, and it took about 15 minuets to be seated.Weekend is always busy day. The food we ordered was very good , I like the Egg Benedict, the croissant with ham, eggs and fruits. Especially the croissant,I like it very much!!! But there are still sth not perfect,  the space is crowded between table to table. And also because of the limited room, it's noisy. Waiters can hardly get to your side. Overall worth trying~"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good , but should be careful during the billing info. I ordered brunch brava and orange juice , they charge me almost 30$. And they wouldn't give u the receipt until and unless u ask them to give . I was little shocked and asked for the bill , shockingly they charge something vitamin c with 11$ which I didn't order at all. Yes people do make mistake , but guys don't forget to ask your receipt"}
{"text":"Super slow service, can't believe I wait more than half an hour for my bill. And the size for their hippie salad is like side salad I get from other restaurants."}
{"text":"Terrible Service. Took 1.5 hours to get the food. Tiny plates. Starving after, had to go for a second dinner."}
{"text":"Portland Variety. Where have I been living? Under a rock it seems because this is hands down (now) one of my favourite brunch spots in the city.  Here's why:  Coffee  - full bodied, smooth, sweet and needed absolutely nothing added to it. I asked for milk which I normally have with my coffee but after a quick sip, aborted that idea entirely. I wasn't going to taint that cup with anything.   Service - our waiter (French accent?) was phenomenal. He was working the entire back of the restaurant which was full and never did I feel neglected or had to chase after a coffee refill or water refill. He was a super hero and we weren't shy to tell him he was awesome!  Food - Please note that I do not order sweet brunch items EVER. Eggs eggs eggs is my mantra. I am a savory food lover and what I did this Saturday morning was sacrilegious. I ordered the pancakes. Not just any pancakes but Lemon Ricotta pancakes. The rest of the table ordered a variety of dishes but I never once regretted not having eggs (sacrilegious I'm telling ya). The dollop of cheese on top, the sweetness from the blueberries and hints of lemon icing were just the perfect combination to satisfy my taste buds.   If I don't come back for brunch soon, I will most definitely stop in for a cup of coffee.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"A great brunch location with good drinks and very attentive staff.  The food was nice and served fast; the patio area is especially nice during a summer day."}
{"text":"Meh this place is okay. The menu is disappointing but the atmosphere and service are always on point. Too bad the food isn't better. Expect a 60min wait for brunch."}
{"text":"Visited Toronto for the first time and went with a large group. The service was amazing, all of the hosts were very straight up with their recommendations! Love that. We tried a whole bunch off the brunch menu, the huevos were the best but everything was amazing too! We tried about 10 different dishes and no one was a disappointed.   Also, the drinks are bomb. We had the Cesar and mimosas, all super tasty.   Totally recommend this place for brunch for anyone visiting Toronto :)"}
{"text":"Walked around King Street on a Saturday morning and decided to pop into this cafe for brunch at around 11am.  We luckily didn't have to wait as we got some of the last seats at the bar table. The menu is relatively small but each option sounded delicious. My friend and I both opted for the eggs benedict. We rather enjoyed the size as it was not too large or too small.   We also got a much needed helping of coffee and americanos with our meal.  Overall an enjoyable experience and will likely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"I have had nothing but amazing treats and drinks from this establishment.  Service is amazing and the space beautifully reflects the King West vibe."}
{"text":"I had a lovely night here. Came w a girlfriend and we were able to sit right away on their patio which is a nice set up with tables and lighting hung everywhere. Our server was super chill and friendly throughout the night. The crowd here is typical king crowd and I swear every single person was beautiful. Perfect place for people watching. Food was small portions, more tapas like, but very delicious. Our drinks were great flavour and they have quite the list of variety( no pun intended). It's a little pricey so more of a share a tapa and grab a drink before heading to Lou dawgs or somewhere farther from this swank part of town. It is definitely the perfect date spot if your wanting to impress someone  or on a special evening!"}
{"text":"Took my friend here for her bday and we were pleasantly surprised. Perfect spot for a first date. The ambiance is amazing and the food was divine! Reasonably priced. Would definitely recommend and go back."}
{"text":"Portland Variety is yet another restaurant in Toronto's restaurant scene that feels like it has filled out the check box of what people are looking for\"at the moment\" - small sharing plates that are overpriced; pretty room with clean simple lines; pretty servers in hipster uniforms who aren't quite polished; and overpriced strange-combination-cocktails.    So, here are some things I liked: the room really is pretty; the service was friendly - just not super efficient or polished; the bathrooms are so nice.  Seriously.  The sanitary dispenser was the coolest thing I'd ever seen.  The choices are food are interesting, but nothing I was particularly interested in, if that makes sense?  Seemed like it was just a carbon copy of so many other places.  I hated the glassware that the drinks came in.  I almost didn't want my drink when it arrived - it was just the skinniest, smallest looking glass.  I'm not usually hung up on presentation if taste and value are there, but these drinks sucked.  So, I wouldn't go back.  BUT - big BUT - there are people in Toronto right now who would love this place.  I know, because I was there with them.  And for that reason, it is doing something right."}
{"text":"Yelpers look for a place that can deliver in terms of not just food and service but presentation too. However, these places are not plentiful. Therefore, I think I'm at a crossroad in which I have to decide if a restaurant it's worth visiting for the presentation or its food.   We came for Sunday Easter brunch. There's free street parking available on Sundays until 1pm on Adelaide. We came in right after 10am and there was no lineup so we were seated right away.   The Good: The presentation of their dishes are Instagram worthy and this is before filters and retouching. The place is nice and trendy with a lot of natural light.   The Average: The Egg Benedict and Fried Egg Bravas were okay. The fruits used on the Benedict were not of the highest quality. The spices used on the potatoes for the Bravas made it salty with not a lot of bacon on the dish.  The service was adequate with minimal interaction but fairly responsive when asked for something.   The Bad: I did not like the Huevos Chilaquiles. Their version of Huevos Rancheros did not work. I felt like I was eating a salsa dip than breakfast. I also couldn't taste the chorizo in the dish either.   The Ugly: The cost of the dishes. Just be aware that a glass of orange juice cost $6.50 and a side order of bacon (4 strips) is $6.   Safe to say that my Instagram feed looks nicer thanks to this experience but I prefer my breakfast/brunch to be hearty.  #50 of 2018"}
{"text":"Poor service and overrated/overpriced food & drinks. Their pasta was bland as hell. Cornish hen was way too salty. All you tasted was salt. Received the most horrid food recommendations from our waitress, had our plates & bills mixed up, and were not informed that gratuities were already added to our bills.   There are plenty of much better restos along King Street - do NOT bother wasting your time and money here."}
{"text":"This is a long overdue review, as I came here with a few girlfriends over the Christmas holidays for dinner.   The food was pretty decent with some tasty dishes, but many other restaurants could offer similar quality at their price points. Service was good as one of our friends had dietary restrictions and the restaurant accommodated as best as they could.   We enjoyed a visually pleasing drink (think it was the Royal Garden at $14) which was refreshing and not too strong. It came with an ice cube with a flower inside.  We tried the following dishes:  - Wild Yeast Sourdough and Cristal Bread with hand butter ($4) - The bread was quite delicious, with a doughy texture inside, and a nice crunch on the outside. But yeah, bread is not free here.  - Patatas Bravas ($8) - The potatoes were cooked nicely with an exterior crust, yet it was soft inside.  It came with spiced tomatos, topped with a creamy aioli. This was quite a delicious snack, but many other tapas restaurants would be able to serve this staple with similar quality.  - Grilled Octopus ($24) - The octopus was cooked well with a nice char. However, there wasn't anything exciting about the flavours and at $24, it was a bit on the pricey side as the dish only came with 2 average sized tentacles.  - Meatballs ($18) -  Similar to the grilled octopus, this dish only came with 3 meatballs, so it's definitely on the pricey side.  Although the meatballs were moist and flavourful, there wasn't any twist or wow factor, so didn't feel it was worth $18. We didn't do this intentionally, but a lot of the dishes we ordered had tomato sauce, so the flavour profiles started to taste similar.   -  Smoked Venison Tartare ($21) - The flavours were good, although I don't recall any smokiness. I enjoyed the pickled egg on the side, it was quite unique and the acid complemented well with the tartare.   -  Oxtail Gnocchi ($19) - I like my gnocchi soft, with that ever so slight resistance when I chew into it. The gnocchi served here was too soft for my liking, there was no resistance at all and the oxtail gravy wasn't anything exciting. The way the oxtail was prepared and incorporated into the gravy made it taste just like regular beef brisket. Again, this dish was quite pricey for the portion served.  Overall, the food isn't bad. However, there wasn't anything memorable enough to draw me back again, especially as these price points. There are just too many great restaurants in Toronto to try out and repeat visits are rare unless something really impresses!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner here. I'm generally not in love with most King St. restaurants as I find they're more style over substance. The menu was varied and there were lots of things I wanted to order. The Oxtail Gnocchi was wonderful. Everything else we ordered was quite good. eggplant, croquetas, Yucca Frites. Nothing was a 10, but generally very very good. I especially loved the wine list. Many interesting varietals and a clear disdain for the big name, familiar 'brands'. If you're going to spend money on the markup at a restaurant, it makes sense to have something you can't get at the LCBO.  Decor was nice, but very loud inside. The table of drunk dudes next to us made it hard to hear anything. I'm all for loud and drunk, but five men chortling together can make for a deafening noise.  Definitely not a place for an intimate dinner, but a solid stop for a tasty nosh and some good wine before a night on the town."}
{"text":"Brunch! They make a fantastic lemon ricotta pancake. It is one of the best pancakes around. The ambience is really nice and the prices are quite reasonable, given that it is in the middle of the expensive King West area. This place is worth a visit for good value They also have a nice little caf√© at the front with delicious pastries and coffee to go."}
{"text":"I'd like to come back and try this place again for brunch, but dinner wasn't anything special for the price we paid. It was tapas style, so as expected portions were small and shared. Flavor was there but once again, nothing really worth the price. We had the patatas bravas, grilled octopus, beef carpaccio, and their pork special."}
{"text":"Food: 8/10 -- Value: 6/10 -- Service: 6/10 -- Ambiance/D√©cor: 9/10  The place is nice and gets busy quick. Brunch service starts at 10:00am and if you get there between 10-10:30, you'll definitely be able to get a seat. The atmosphere is nice, but the service was very slow for ordering and getting the bill.   Food is good, but the portions are too small. Their dishes are very simple and there's not much elevation to it. My eggs benedict ($14) was no frills regular eggs benedict in a croissant. It tasted great, but it is definitely not enough as a single portion, especially under the guise of \"brunch\" in place of breakfast and lunch.  My friends had the huevos with smoked tomato, refried beans, chorizo, cheese, guacamole, salsa ($14), which looked small, but tasted pretty good, and the eggplant byaldi with lemon yogurt, poached eggs, and smoked paprika ($12), which was far too acidic; my friend didn't finish the eggplant dish.  We also shared a pastry platter, which was a great deal at $10. It came with a chocolate croissant, chocolate chip cookie, some type of tart thing with custard inside, and a moist muffiny chocolate cake thing. All four things were delicious and a great way to end the brunch. If you come here, I'd highly recommend this because you are not going to be full on just the main dishes."}
{"text":"This was the fourth and final restaurant we went to on our restaurant hopping evening. By the time we got here, we only had room for dessert. The lemon ice with strawberries and syrup was the perfect dessert after the evening filled with otherwise crazy rich food (oysters, prawns and mac n' cheese!). It was sweet and tart, cooling, and was something I could trick myself into thinking was relatively healthy compared to everything else we had consumed.   The restaurant is packed even later on in the evening. It's a fun place to be and a great addition to the King area."}
{"text":"Great food, great music, great service.   Went there for brunch and became an instant neighborhood favorite for us.   Will be going back!"}
{"text":"A cozy spot perfect for Sunday brunch  My preferred combo Coffee: Flat white Savory: Huevos Rancheros Sweet: Ricotta Cheese and Blueberry Pancakes"}
{"text":"Located at the southwest corner of king and Portland, this restaurant offers quick grab and go's and dine in with a nice patio in the summertime. It's a bit of an upscale fare (but not too much) although you'll see plenty of patrons walks in with very casual clothing.   This was my 3rd time visiting the restaurant, 2nd time dining in. If you're a fan of weekend brunch, definitely look at the menu! The portions are not as big as some of the other brunch places but is definitely quality food. I strongly recommend it.   We visited earlier this week for dinner and drinks (pictures available). We ordered the potatoes bravas (a Spanish dish) which was pretty good - will be a willing to order again and we both ordered what was on the special - grilled asparagus with an egg. It was okay - found the portion not filling enough/too small for dinner (and I'm not someone who eats large portions) but paired with the appetizer, we left the restaurant feeling still a bit hungry.   Service is good - waiters are attentive. Do recommend this place but don't expect to get a large meal out of it."}
{"text":"Definitely one on my favorite brunch places in the city.  The huevos, byaldi and lemon pancakes are all out of this world. Grab a chocolate chip cookie while you wait for a table - probably the gooiest in the city."}
{"text":"I saw this place during the day as I was walking around Toronto, acquainting myself with this new city. I returned at night to chill on this very cold day.  I had a couple of glasses of red wine and ordered a salad and some tapas. The place was not very busy, which may have contributed to just an okay appeal. The food was good, just not anything too memorable."}
{"text":"Location: On King West. Street parking is available but check the signage because it's metered. Paid parking starts at 1 p.m. on Sundays.   The place: Great decor - they have a small dining area inside and a terrace outside. The decor is simple but comfortable - wood floors, big windows.  The goods: I had the avocado on toast with scrambled eggs and a side of bacon. The eggs were fluffy and had a great consistency, the avocado was just mashed (no seasoning) but that didn't bother me. Crusty sourdough bread came with the dish - the avocado was already spread out on one, leaving one piece of bread, to do with, what I wished. The bacon was PHENOMENAL and I hardly ever eat that sh*t. It was definitely worth the extra charge. Yummy. I ordered a Macchiato as well and it was OK. My friends ordered the Huevas and loved it.   Side note: the day before, my bestie brought me here to buy me the 'best cookie in Toronto.' I was skeptical because it takes a lot to blow me away but GODDAMN was it ever good. They bake these huge, fat, awesome chocolate chip cookies that are probably the equivalent of 1000000 calories because they weight like, a pound, but they are worth every sinful bite. In the area and need a snack? Do it. If you're from Montreal and familiar with Nev√©'s chocolate chip cookie - these are BETTER. True story.   Service: Good.   Price point: On average with most brunch places. I think my dish was $12...."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict was great, served on a croissant! Food came very quickly, despite the restaurant being full for brunch. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for a while, and I decided to check it out on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  I am surprised to say that regardless of how popular/busy this place is, we were able to get a table on the patio in less than five minutes.  The food:  We both had the huevos (eggs Mexican style with salsa and tostinis) and they were delicious. The presentation was thoughtful and worthy of an Instagram pic. We shared a plate of lemon ricotta pancakes which came with blueberry preserve and were delicious as well. The menu says they're a bit of a wait, but they came out pretty quickly and before our huevos.   The service:  The service was good, and they didn't rush us or kick us out while we took our time catching up and enjoying ourselves.   Overall Impression:  A nice casual place for brunch and possibly dinner (they do dinner). Nothing to write home about, but definitely a solid brunch spot that will become a regular in my rotation. The neighbourhood is pretty hip, so come here for brunch and then take a walk and check out the shops/cafes in the area."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out! I had brunch with a friend at Portland Variety on the weekend and absolutely loved it! Love the decor and ambience. Food was amazing and prices were reasonable as well :) will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit overpriced in terms of the portion of the food. The flavour is pretty good compared to most of restaurants in the area. Their mixed drinks are really creative and well balanced - highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. It was good but not mind blowing. Everything is nicely prepared, and the portions are a little on the small side. The cassava fries are worth a try, but all together nothing really stands out.   The brunch looks awesome tho. I will definitely be back for it."}
{"text":"Found this place on Instagram. I was really excited to try and finally did and wasn't let down! My friend and I ordered the lemon ricotta blue berry pancakes as well as the Egg Benedict! Super delicious! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I realized this place is chosen for top octopus in TO. I would say it was okay, not the best octopus, but it was good. The food portion is really small. But good quality. Over priced too."}
{"text":"If I could rate this \"no stars\" I would. We went out for dinner and it was recommended we order about two plates each because they were small plates. We ordered :  -bone marrow : disappointing  -olives: they were sooo small it was all pit and no olive. If your making olives one of your plates you should atleast serve the meatier ones -croquettes : this is the only thing I liked -mushroom salad: horrible, we didn't even eat it. It's a pile of arugula tossed in gross dressing and hidden in the middle are warm mushrooms on top of a cheese slice???? Really? -zucchini sand which thing: sub par  We also ordered a glass of wine each which were minimum $17 to accompany our shit food. We told the server about the salad, but instead of providing some customer service to make up for it she awkwardly avoided our table/ dropped off the bill then ran away without making eye contact.   When we finally got her to talk to us I asked her if they were known for having good brunch or lunch instead of dinner, since Portland variety is very popular, but she replied that dinner was actually their most popular!   We were surprised, still very hungry and annoyed that it cost $40+ per person for barely any food, and also for food that didn't even taste good.  Overhyped, save your money and go to gusto101 or buca for the same price and better food.  Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Breakfast wraps are delicious. And their mini cookies are addictive! A bit pricey overall so i wouldn't drop in daily..but nice for a treat. Mocha was underwhelming...strong but lacking flavour really. Will go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome Grilled Octopus!  Mushroom Arugula Salad should not be passed up.  I will have to go back to try more."}
{"text":"A friend and I had brunch today and our experience was delightful. It was a beautiful fall sunny day and there was a 30 minute wait for a patio table. However, they have plenty of bar stools in their cafe area and we basked in the sun while waiting for our table. More importantly, the food was excellent. I ordered the huevos rancheros and my dish was delicious. The portion was on the smaller side and could have used more eggs. However, everything was delicious! The mixture of avocado, beans, salsa, and eggs went well together. We also split a plate of pancakes which were equally delicious. Staff was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Extremely pleased coming here for Sunday brunch. The wait was about 20 mins but there's seating in front. The decor is clean and the space is well lit with a small skylight at the center.   I was torn between whether to go for a savory or sweet option so I finally settled for the lemon ricotta pancakes and a side of smoked juniper bacon. The pancakes come in a stack of three with cream cheese mousse on top and a berry compote. It was divine and so filling. Bacon was always going to be a safe option. The Rosebud Sweet Tea cocktail was light and tart. A good one for the summer or those who enjoy citrus flavors."}
{"text":"Popped in to grab a Caramel Latte. The larger size was about $4.50 with the tax. They are pretty efficient. Offer sandwiches and subs as well as hot drinks. Saw no mention of cold drinks, although they offer bottled water and other canned drinks. The interior is pretty, just like the exterior. However, it seemed pretty empty, likely because it was lunch time and King West has an abundance of lunch spots. I took my cup to go, and found it to be a smooth latte with just the right amount of sweetness. Price-wise, comparable to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Well, I've stopped hitting up Portland Variety for coffee because Quantum Coffee has them beat. 1 for no pretentious staff, and 2 for actually giving a shit about your response when the asked how you're doing.   HOWEVER, I figured I'd go with a girlfriend  to Portland for brunch. I am vegan, I asked for a very very basic substitution! Beans (which they serve) for the eggs. NOPE! \"We don't make any substitutions here. We can only remove and item\" the waiter said in a dismissive tone. I said \"wait....so, I remove an item and it's the SAME price?\". To which the waiter replied \"yes\".  I'd give this place 0 stars. They lost me before..I've given them a second chance. I even brought a new patron who was equally disgusted.  Shame on your shitty shitty staff and service."}
{"text":"I've eaten there a couple times, slowly moving up to trying them out for dinner. Would definitely recommend for a great morning coffee/pastry, as well as a great lunch destination. The only thing is do not come hungry for dinner. The place is a great hip environment and the placement is really nice, but it's definitely not the best bang for your buck on Portland."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch this past saturday with 2 friends and had the best experience!  The waitress (long blonde hair, very friendly and welcoming) was speedy and very attentive, and the food was out of this world (french toast).  Highly recommend!  Prices were on par for brunch in the area, but for the service and overall experience I was happy to pay that."}
{"text":"I ordered the Patatas Bravas served with fried eggs, spicy tomato, juniper bacon lardons, and aioli. My friend had the French Toast with strawberries and cream. The Patatas Braves felt like I was just eating heaps of salt with every bite. The potatoes were very crispy with a nice runny egg on top. It's a nice dish to share with someone, eating a whole plate on your own would be too much sodium imo. The french toast was delicious though. It felt like we were eating a cloud. It was made with brioche bread, so the dish is on the sweeter side. It's also served with the maple syrup on the side, not really necessary but if you have a sweet tooth go for it! The cream it was served with was also very pleasant, had a nice light, cheesy flavour.   Overall, a good place to grab brunch on a weekday as service is excellent and has a great atmosphere. Will be back to try their other brunch dishes!"}
{"text":"The place is stunning. The food, not really. Overpriced IMO and way too much saucy seasoning on high quality ingredients. Cool dishes like a full octopus tentacle, nice and crunchy, a bit chewy. Rice was bad, too buttery and what the hell is all the creamy mayo sauce for. Awesome cocktails, that's for sure. But $$$$ of course!"}
{"text":"New favourite Toronto bartender! Christina was absolutely fantastic.   My friend and I sat down for drinks as we were on the waiting list for another spot.   Christina came over and started asking me what kind of cocktails I like. I'm usually just a red wine and beer kind of gal but figured I'd give one of the cocktails a try.   After answering some of her questions, Christina came back with probably the best cocktail I've ever had (even though I haven't had many.) It was vodka with cucumber water and there was even a flower in the ice cube! (Added a photo) I have no idea what it was called but I'm sure if you show up they'd totally help you find something.   We ended up ditching the waiting list at the other place and just hanging out at the bar and ordering! I highly recommend the potatoes. They're so delicious.   Going to have to come back for brunch!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Takes forever to get your damn coffee. Once had a coffee with the milk turning disgusting!"}
{"text":"I ended up back at Portland Variety for brunch and am happy I gave this restaurant another chance after being underwhelmed by my dinner experience (see previous review). As a picky eater, I am usually not overwhelmed by a brunch menu but this time around I had a very difficult time choosing!  I ended up ordering the grilled eggplant with poached eggs that were stewed in a tomato sauce served with toasted sourdough bread.  As per my earlier review, I still felt the food came out a bit too quickly (although for brunch I am generally not looking to linger as long as dinner so pass on this front) and the portions could have been more generous.  The coffee was also delicious and I made sure to squeeze in some extra refills."}
{"text":"I checked yelp before I go and apparently , ppl is right. Those lunch dishes actually could made at home and taste so average. Location are really nice though. Maybe I should try their pastry next time."}
{"text":"Great patio for king street people watching.  The food is also pretty good.  They have one of the best burgers in the city.  The burger is grass fed and is served on the best bun on the city.  Get the cassava fries   They are addictive.    The mushroom salad is also a really great choice here.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"With tones of a 50s classy jazz scene, Portland variety is not your ordinary variety store. \"Their Brown Rice Organic Oats Quinoa Porridge was great - not sweet but very flavorful. It came topped with hazelnuts, dried cranberries, and a few slices of strawberry. It was also quite tiny but delicious none-the-less.\"  This is just a bite of our full review.."}
{"text":"Despite the poor reviews, I decided to check this place out for myself.   Bottom line, don't waste your time or money...the service was horrible and the food was just ok.  After 15min we were able to finally order, partial order came. One item was not available so they took it upon themselves to replace with another item (which they charged us for). Last dish came as we asked for the bill and no longer had utensils (that remained on the bill too). Had to ask for the bill three times. There was not one server that I could even point to as we had so many people covering the table, yet they all seemed incompetent. Not one person asked how we were doing, if they could top up water, coffee etc.  There are so many great restaurants in Toronto that offer great service and great food...don't settle."}
{"text":"This is a review for BRUNCH.  SERVICE: Went on a Sunday at 12PM and got seated right away in the patio, table for 2. The service was not good as it took the server about 15 minutes to come introduce himself to us. I understand that it was busy but not once did check up on us through the meal.  FOOD: We ordered the Eggs Benny which came on a croissant, ham, and a variety of fruits. I liked the croissant, and the fruits added a refreshing addition to the brunch. Overall, the eggs benny was good but nothing special and not that filling considering it only came with a side of fruits. I've had a variety of eggs benny at other brunch places and they would serve it with a side of potatos and a salad which was more filling.  AMBIENCE: We sat on the patio and it was nice and sunny. However keep in mind that Portland Variety is at the intersection of King/Portland so it is a little loud when you're seated outdoors as there are pedestrians and cars passing.   Would I go back? Maybe, if I was around the corner but I'm downtown so there are tons of other options."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that I wish would exist in Windsor, but doesn't, which is why I invariably end up in Detroit so often. Snacks, hipster music and staff, great spirits, passable beer, and more than enough in the general atmosphere to make up for a somewhat unexpectedly limited wine list.  I'll start with some of the cons. As I alluded above, the wine list isn't great. And I don't expect a casual snack bar to have a long list of stunners. But offer some neat stuff by the glass, at least. More than two or three, and more than almost exclusively VQA pours. It doesn't make sense with the rest of the cosmopolitan menu.  Additionally, I really wanted to order from the snack menu at lunch and wasn't able to. I've had Ib√©rico before and really wanted to see how they presented it, and was disappointed to hear I could only order from the lunch menu. But I got past it.  I had the warm mushroom and arugula salad with added seared hen. The salad was terrific and I wasn't expecting it to be. It was curiously arranged, with all the mushrooms and dressing buried underneath a pile of arugula and pinenuts. At first I thought this amounted to poor presentation, but it actually made sense. The arugula stayed fresh, vital, and crisp by not warming up, and this contrasted and paired perfectly with delicious warm, assorted mushrooms, accented nicely by a soy-based dressing and the sharp manchego. The hen was a little dry, but Portland made up for that with a nice accompanying sauce, spicy and tangy. It was served incredibly quickly which means that the hen is pre-cooked, but I understand that.  I drank a Cafe Biscotti to start, then had a nice bottle of Italian beer, Collesi. The former was a nice warm-up after an enormous windy blizzard, and the latter was a great, dry friend to accompany my book and light lunch. Both were very nice and unique.  The decor and atmosphere of the place is definitely great. Light hipster music playing softly, like Cults or Passion Pit, with a beautiful white marble bar and bright natural lighting contrasting mostly black furniture. Very modern, very cool. I would recommend it to anyone as a casual hangout, and I assume it would be even better if you could share a few snack menu items."}
{"text":"Decent patio and vibe (can be super sleepy on certain evenings ...), cool drinks (tequila bomb smoke show), and so so food.  Go for the drinks - either outside on the patio or inside at the bar - and skip the eats."}
{"text":"Great vibe, beautiful light sunshiney space and wonderful service.  We sat at bar and ordered patatas bravas, two fried eggs, spicy tomato, wild boar pancetta lardons + eggplant byaldi, herbed yogurt, poached eggs, smoked paprika + watermelon margarita (fresh watermelon juice, fresh lime juice, chilli flakes, jalapeno infused agave, milagro blanco).....then flat whites to go from cafe in front. So, so satisfying."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here.  Very nice space - roomy & lots of Windows looking out onto the street.  Wanted scrambled eggs toast & fruit & they let us order \"off menu\"  to get just that. Best scrambled eggs ever which might not sound important but it takes paying attention to the little things to deliver eggs that are soft fluffy & delicious.   Staff was warm & professional."}
{"text":"I have seen food pictures from this place on Instagram and they looked amazing.  So,  I decided to come here for brunch on Sunday with my sister.  I have to say this place gets real busy.  We were lucky that we were only two people so we had the option to be seated at the bar,  so our wait time wasn't too bad.  But if you come here with more people be prepare to wait.  In the front of the restaurant they have a cafe,  so you can get coffee and baked goodies while you wait for your table,  or drop by to get your morning java before you head off to work.   We ordered three things to share - the eggplant,  the avocado toast,  and the ricotta.  All the dishes we ordered where good.  The prices were reasonable and the portions were just right for brunch.   I like the environment too.  It is a small place but you don't feel crampted and I find it has a nice lay back vibe even though its packed with people.  I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"No place to hang coats! In bathrooms! All hooks broken. Good live music. Please fix bathrooms."}
{"text":"Coffee is really good, You might have to wait for . While before getting a table but the waiting area is nice!  Service is good and waiters are friendly, food doesnt take super long to be ready even when it is busy.   Had the avocado on toast with eggs, perfect combo!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went to Portland Variety on a Thursday night with a friend. Great atmosphere, would be a great place to go on a date or out with friends. Personally speaking, no place is better than sitting at the bar- which is where we sat. We enjoyed a light dinner, 3 small plates split between the 2 of us, I would highly recommend the warm mushroom & arugula salad and shrimp pil pil. My favorite cocktails were the Wood Still Sour & Kentucky Trail!"}
{"text":"Best chocolate chip walnut cookies I've ever had.  Way better than Le Gourmand even - perfectly soft and chewy on the inside but not undercooked like Le Gourmand's and a slight crunch on the outside.  But most importantly - not too much chocolate like Le Gourmand's and it doesn't taste too sweet.  It's perfect."}
{"text":"Been here for coffee and for dinner.   Coffee was good, a bit too fearing roasted for my liking but better than chain coffee shops.   Dinner was tasty and offerings were unique, but the menu was fairly limited and incredibly over-priced for what you get (very small portions). The server tried and was very nice, but overall service was very slow even though the restaurant wasn't very busy.   I'd return if invited or asked by someone else, but don't think I'd recommend it as my choice for dinner if asked."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. The place can get quite busy, but we were fortunate to get a place immediately. I had the Huevos Chilaquiles, which was very good. The orange juice is also organic and freshly squeezed, which is a pet peeve of mine. All in all, definitely one of the better brunch places I've been too."}
{"text":"It was such an amazing experience having Sunday brunch at PV, however it's first come first serve so highly recommended to get on your way earlier (Our wait for 4 was only 20 minutes). Their pastry basket to share was so delicious (honestly best cookie (walnut chocolate chip) and croissant I've ever tasted - they heat them up for you and are super fresh), latte tastes extremely rich and foamy (Ive had MANY lattes in my 24 years of living), and the meals were not only presentable, but tasted really good too (My friends got Patatas bravas, fried eggs, spicy tomato,juniper bacon lardons, aioli and their french toast.. and I ordered the Eggplant byaldi, lemon yogurt, poached eggs, smoked paprika, which tasted fab - healthy and satisfying. I would definitely recommend this place for dinner as well, menu looks great. Also a great place for coffee/drinks on the go with a pastry."}
{"text":"I've been here 2x for brunch and 1x for dinner. As I've been here for dinner more recently, this review will mainly focus on that.  I would categorize Portland Variety as your typical King West restaurant. Trendy with Instagram worthy dishes, but at a cost.  Dinner is tapas style, but I found the variety to be lacking. Not a lot to choose from on the menu and the prices were quite high. For example the shrimp piri piri came with 4 pieces of shrimp in sauce, a few pieces of bread and I think it was over $25. Dinner for two was $130 before tip with one drink each (one glass of wine, and one non-alcoholic drink) and 5 tapas dishes. Not worth it IMO.  I find food to be mediocre to good depending on the dish, but have not had anything amazing. It gets very busy at brunch so come early or prepare to wait. Interestingly enough we weren't able to make a dinner reservation after 7pm on a Saturday, although when we arrived the restaurant was half empty and stayed that way.  Our server for dinner wasn't very personable, but service was okay. Not great, but not horrible either. Our water glasses stayed topped up and our empty dishes were whisked away in a reasonable amount of time. Food does take a while to come out though. They inform you when you order that food will come out as its ready, so don't think you're going to get the salads first and the meats last but rather in a random order according to the kitchen.  Given the number of other restaurants in the area, I don't think Portland Variety stands out enough for me to come back again."}
{"text":"Its not a variety store in any way  I was in the area and I had heard that they offered a nutso Cornish hen sandwich. Who eats that stuff?   Well we do!!  So for $8 you get a juicy Cornish hen chicken sandwich on a bun, with pear slices, a garlicy arugula pesto and a spicy piri piri sauce.  The little bird is very juicy and it is a wonderful sandwich  I stamp my foot down and say Go eat this!  BTW the cool thing that I had first got interested in the concept that chef Castrinos grows the chilis in the priri piri sauce on the roof of the building.  So this is a farm to fork sandwich  no there is some other great things on the menu worth exploring but my plan of attack was for this item.  I never would have a pear in my bun but in this case it works....it works very well in encouraging your taste buds to get excited.  i asked for extra sauce on the side for more heat!"}
{"text":"I love Portland Variety. The people are so nice and the food is amazing. The smoke trout salad is to die for."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to Portland Variety for quite some time - mainly because of all the tempting Instagram photos that I keep seeing on my feed - the photos of their European style brunch items, their decor and the mural of Kate Moss (located behind the restaurant) were all enough to convince me to give Portland a shot.   I came in rather late today so brunch wasn't an appropriate meal. I ended up getting an in between meal of the hippie salad along with an iced vanilla latte. Both the salad and latte were delicious! I especially enjoyed the tahini vinaigrette on the salad and the vanilla latte was very refreshing.   The ambiance and decor is perfect - I love the geometric lamps and dish ware! The front of the restaurant is very charming with various baked goods and pastries. I also like the incorporation of the open kitchen.   Overall, the interior design of Portland Variety is very sophisticated, very chic, and very European - basically everything that they represent in their menu. Staff were friendly and accommodating. The only complaint that I have about PV is the priciness. I ended up paying $20 for just the salad and latte together. Despite the somewhat high prices, I'm definitely down for coming here again, but next time, for their famous brunches!"}
{"text":"Came here for my 16th birthday with my friends, and had an amazing experience. The food was great and the customer service was even better. There was an error on my bill and they invited me back over to get it fixed. They were very understanding and considerate! However if anyone does chose to come, keep in mind that there is a long wait (although it's understandable because the food there is fantastic). If anyone is planning to go for brunch, I'd suggest going at around 10:00am, and DEFINITELY order the smashed avocado :) thanks again Portland Variety!"}
{"text":"The place is cool looking and fun. A little too fashionable for my taste but I'm a schlepper. Great if you're a king West bro. I'm not broey enough. But I don't mean to detract from the quality of the restaurant,  the food is great from what I've tried and the breakfast wraps and croissants are stellar. I wish they had better beer though. Too many great beers in the area at Wvrst,  biermarkt and barhop for this selection to be acceptable. If they made that one change and brought in some more craft beer I would come here a lot. For now I'll just do breakfast. One other criticism is the service is a little weak. They're all very nice and all that but they seem a bit disorganized. I'm sure they'll get past that though,  as they're pretty new."}
{"text":"Only got to sit in here for some late night desserts but it is such a pretty restaurant! The plates/china are perfection, like all the dishes are this beautiful, modern blue. The servers are attentive and still give you great service even if you only order a little bit. I had the beignets and pana cotta shared with two friends. Very palette refreshing and tasty! The pana cotta dish is served with pop rocks which spices up the traditional dish! I will definitely be returning here for brunch sometime soon."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast and brunch place! Very lively atmosphere, great food, friendly service. Huevos were amazing, and had the best patatas bravas I had outside Spain! Pancakes are also very very good and huge!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere; lively, warm, comfortable, casual but upscale enough. Not snobby. Cheese plate was okayyyy: the cheddar had a not-so-great aftertaste butthe other two were great. Cocktails were well-made and wine selection was solid. Our waiter was a little inattentive but had excellent recommendations and clearly knew his food-and-drink. Cauliflower app was a little disappointing (bready and not as scrumptuous as I was hoping for). Octopus was very tasty: a little spicy for my personal taste but very flavourful and perfectly cooked. Finally, the braised shortribs were absolutely delicious. The portion was very generous, and we could not stop eating this. The cheesy/creamy potatoes and gravy and root vegetables were perfectly paired with the meat. An absolute must. Overall a very successful evening and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Went there after dinner for dessert and a couple of drinks. The pana cota was very good. It was a nice combination of flavors and textures. The place is nicely designed and has a cool trendy vibe to it."}
{"text":"The food is good but a tad overpriced, then I realized I was on King West lol  Bone marrow needs more marrow but the cocktails were amazing and the best deal is the ribeye at $45, just check my photo and tell me otherwise.  Definitely would come back and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday with a big group and ate essentially everything on the menu. The food was phenomenal. The octopus was insanely amazing, the steak was incredible (and I rarely ever eat red meat), and the crudo -which i had for the second time, was just as outrageously good as the first time. Even the desserts -which we hardly had any room for, were so yummy.  The servers were great but the hostess situation was a mess. It was a big birthday for me, with my parents and step family meeting my boyfriend and the hostesses brought us to a table of strangers and said \"here is the rest of your party\" and after I had a mini panic attack, they asked the table of people to move from my reserved table, which was beyond awkward. Thankfully the food made up for it!"}
{"text":"A great atmosphere with excellent food. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with suggestions on what to eat and how much to order.   The octopus was my favourite and had a nice spice to it.   The price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Great cup of coffee, unique decor, and lots of space. In full candor, l'd give this place a 4 star just for how clean their bathrooms were."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on a Friday night for some tapas. Luckily they had a spot on their patio, which is located on a beautiful side street off of King West.   Food - We had the house-made ricotta, beef tenderloin carpaccio, and the warm mushroom arugula salad. The ricotta had a unique twist to it, with some nectarines and sweet flavouring in it. The beef carpaccio was topped with thick slices of cheese and garnishes. It tasted good but I felt that it was served a little too wet. The mushroom salad really impressed me - they somehow made the mushroom flavourful and dry, which nicely complimented the plain arugula salad.   Drinks - I had the rosebud tea cocktail. It was sweet and tasty, but a little watered down.   Service - The service was decent. However, we were looking for the waitress' recommendations on her favourite tapas but she ended up recommending the entire menu, which was not very useful as we were only two people and could only try 3-4 tapas. I did appreciate that they offered to replace the bread that was served with the ricotta as soon as we were done.  Overall, a great vibe on the Portland Variety patio if you are in the King West area."}
{"text":"The snobbish staff made me feel unwelcome. There was an air of fake politeness while everybody looked down on me. I was in this place more than three times, and I thought it is just an inaccurate first impression. But as the saying goes: you fool me ones, shame on you, you fool me twice, shame on me... The food is good, the pastries are excellent, but how can you just ignore the unfriendly atmosphere. They would be better off with a self-serve pastry machine, I would definitely go there daily... Until then, I am waiting for a change in ambiance."}
{"text":"Located on the trendy King W strip, my friends and I decided to check this place out for brunch last week.  It's small so expect a wait.  On Sundays they are open from 10-3pm only.   Inside at the front is where you can get takeout coffees/pastries.  There are a few tables and stools to wait while a table opens up in the back if you want a sit down meal.  I really do like the vibe of this place - distressed wood tables, the long bar in the centre of the room, beautiful lighting.  The tables are crammed in the back so expect to be sitting on your neighbour's lap!  The brunch menu is decent and of course reflects King W pricing but the portions are huge.  I wanted the hazelnut french toast but they were out of that so they suggested I could have the hazelnut on their pancakes.  3 stacks of goodness of which I could only finish half.  It had the hazelnut spread in a little pour container.  There was also a generous dollop of some lemon infused creme fraiche on top.  It was a little too thick and doughy for my liking.  They were kind enough to box up the leftovers.  My friend had the scramble eggs with avocado smash toast and loved it.  Service was always polite and pretty fast which was nice considering they were packed.  The bill comes in a empty sardine can.    Overall a good experience but I wouldn't come here just for this, nor wait in line for brunch again.  Our wait was about 20 min as they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a great decor and has a very young/modern/contemporary atmosphere. It would be a great place to drink with a small group of friends. I ordered the fried eggs brava and my friend ordered pancakes. The fried eggs brava is a very hearty meal, so only order it if you are very hungry. It's 2 eggs sitting on a bed of home fries (potatoes) mixed with tomato sauce and garlic aioli. I'm not used to eating so many potatoes in one sitting, so would recommend something else on the menu. Service is friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out as I live nearby. We got bar seats because it cut the wait and we are pretty low maintenance. However, it's because we sat here and I watched the bartender prepare our drinks that took down the rating. He prepared mine in the shaker, then left the shaker on the counter for five minutes as my liquid was being watered down from the melting ice. He proceeded to serve me the watered down cocktail to myself - I was ready to drop the review to three stars. Luckily - the food was fresh and tasty, and the bartender made up for his mistakes with friendly banter. So we moved back up to four stars.  The ambiance was intimate but casual chic, I liked their ceramic white and blue dishes."}
{"text":"I've always liked Portland, not somewhere you can sit and bring a book, but a coffee or drink on the go is ok. Small area to get hot drinks especially when it's busy and crammed. The seating location for front area is odd placing because when people are trying to order and stand in line there no room because people are sitting on the stools. Bad set up."}
{"text":"Pretty good array of tapas. Nice business casual environment. The server was really helpful with suggesting how dishes could be made vegan, although I'm not entirely sure he knew exactly what \"vegan\" meant. I got the salad with the saut√©ed mushrooms. I was a little confused when I received my salad because it initially looked like a massive pile of arugula, but it turned out that the mushroom mix was underneath the greens. One thing I will mention is that when my friends were trying to pick the final dish that they were going to order in their collection of tapas (being vegan, I did not participate), the server only really suggested the two most expensive items on the menu, which were significantly more expensive than the other tapas - the seafood dish and the ribeye (around $28 and $54, respectively).  Also - they didn't have anywhere near enough menus!! The restaurant wasn't even full and initially, they only gave us two food menus for five of us!"}
{"text":"Pretty little place, but nothing too much after that.  Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning. There was roughly a 20 minute wait before we were seated. At the front of the restaurant, there's a nice cafe with many choices for drinks, including mulled cider.  Like many of the reviews here, the food was mediocre. The decor and ambiance is very trendy, very king street west vibes. However, I came for a hearty big breakfast and was a hit disappointed.  Huevos Chilaquiles ($15) - Came in a small baking dish. I was starvinggggg so this did not impress me. It felt like I only ate a quarter of an egg. With all the other great hearty brunch places around on king west, I think we could of done better.  Eggs Benedict ($15) - Also super tiny. It was decent but not one of the better Bennies I've had. Nothing that really impressed me.   One thing I really liked that made Portland stand out though, is their homemade hotsauce. Which I wouldn't of known unless I asked for hot sauce!   Overall, I wouldn't make a return visit anytime soon for the food - a mulled cider might make me come back though."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch at on the weekend! Their brunch menu is surprisingly small. I was craving fresh waffles but because they didn't have any I settled on French toast. It was fantastic!! Would highly recommend if you want something sweet. Their wasn't too much of a wait and the staff are friendly and accommodating!"}
{"text":"After trying to get into Gusto 101 and for being that the wait was incredibly long, we settled on Portland Variety.  We knew nothing about the place since we're not fro Toronto, but it looked cool from the outside.  On the inside it was also cool.    I had a dinner-sized salad, which was very tasty.  My wife had a mushroom gnocchi dish, which she liked.  We had the beignets for dessert, which were not beignets at all -- they were tiny barely-cooked blobs of dough with sugar on the outside.  I'm afraid someone from New Orleans would have been appalled that they called these things beignets.  That said, they were very tasty.    My complaints: it took forever for someone to wait on us once we were seated.  We made our decisions on dishes and the waited a good 15 minutes before our server came to take our orders.  We made a drink and dinner order at the same time, and our dinner came out well before our drinks did.  How long does it take to pour a glass of wine and to make a gin martini?  I can do both in under 30 seconds.  It wasn't as if they were slammed with customers, because they were not.    All this said, the ambience is nice and the food was good.  Would I come back?  Maybe, maybe not.  I'd give another restaurant in the area a try first."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a busy Friday for 5. Got a table right away. This is a tapa style place where the waiter told us to order 2 to 3 dishes per person. We decided to order our own dishes and share.    We ordered:  Mushroom salad - B+....tangy and soft mushrooms with cheese over a bed of arugula salad with nuts.   Meatballs - A .... very soft and melt in your mouth  Sourdough bread - B....served with rosemary butter. It was ok.   Bone marrow - C.... very little bone marrow so I couldn't really taste it. Had a Panko crust so made it even more difficult to taste.   Wellington - A-.... $65 for steak.. it was really soft and tender, but don't know if it's worth $65.  Shrimp - B... it was flavourful, but pretty spicy,   Banana Melli feuille - A....very good, but couldn't taste the banana flavour   Panna cotta - I always like this dessert but enjoy the lemongrass over cherry flavour that I had.   Overall, the food was nicely presented and most dishes were good. It wasn't worth the price because we weren't all full after. We were also charged an 18% tip for 5 people, which is pretty odd since I thought it was for larger tables. It also didn't say on the menu that tip would be automatically added. I didn't like that we didn't know. Usually these things are pretty transparent. We didn't mind giving the tip but thought it would be told to us if our table was indeed large.   They do not split the bill but will split payment."}
{"text":"I've only ordered from their super-slow take out area.   I've tried their fresh orange juice ($5) a few times, and I keep getting burned by it; it's always been super bitter and sour - the worst fresh OJ.  They must use the worst possible oranges.   If anything, this Yelp review serves as a reminder for me, to never ever get the OJ. It's shit (and not in the good way)."}
{"text":"I've been there three times. Once was good.  They advertise 84% (or so) butter croissants. I couldn't finish mine -- tasted like dull bread. Chucked it and went to Colette a block away.  I've had one pastry that was pretty good (a pear danish). Coffee is so-so.  Overall I got a bit of attitude/sadness on the staff side. They seem to be stressed a bit, or not happy. It's like the financial weight of the place is upon the owner and transferred to the staff. It's not a fun place to sit in for that.  It was also somewhat chaotic to order and pay -- seemed everyone's orders were being interleaved. People arrived after me but were getting served/paid before me because they were physically closer to the cash. A little disorganized.  I'll go back since I live very close to it, just to see if they improve. They are new.  They have their pastries sitting in open air in the front, where customers can sneeze on them. I walk by and see the same pastries, sometimes for a long while.  I think some of them should be both refrigerated and covered."}
{"text":"I've been obsessed with this place since my first visit. I bring all my visitors here for brunch and everyone has been impressed so far. I stop by for coffee and their cookies when in the area. I just wish the coffee bar staff weren't so snobby. Overall, great place."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch but they weren't serving their brunch menu. Settled for an avocado sandwich and it was delicious! They also had great coffee and beignets. Would totally come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I went for a work dinner and didn't order anything off the menu myself but got to try many of the dishes that were preordered.  My favorites were the cassava fries and steak, house made ricotta and patatas bravas. The homemade chocolate chip cookies were also delicious. If you've never had cassava fries before, they taste like a sweeter potato fry but not as sweet as sweet potato fries. Here, they are prepared crunchy and salty served with an aioli sauce. I also thought the cheese plate was good and had pickled grapes, very interesting.  It's in a hipster part of town, walking distance to my favorite cocktail spot Spirit House. This restaurant also had an impressive cocktail and spirit list and most people at the table ordered the Old Fashioned which looked legitimate with a large single ice cube and orange peel."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! Expensive but good tapas.   House-made ricotta with crostini, honey and pear - great combination, probably my favorite   Beef Carpaccio - good, thin slices with shaved cheese, arugula and some green sauce  Shrimp Pil Pil - marinated and cooked in chili oil, large and meaty pieces of shrimp, just a bit spicy for me. Served with bread.   Patatas Bravas - what a large plate of potatoes! Fresh and hot, may have burned my tongue but couldn't resist. Near the end it got too salty though. Could use more sauce.   Beignets - warm, vanilla custard filling.. (I was expecting timbits texture, but these are not dense!), dipped in dark chocolate sauce  Good attentive service and nice, dim-light interior.  Overall was ~$35+ pp!!"}
{"text":"Went there for a meeting, which ended up with us having drinks and snacks. Maybe it was in that weird time between shifts on the weekend, but we kept having to wave down servers to get refills of water, cocktails,  and even to order food.   Once,  it was after 7pm,  the service was really good.  You can tell the night staff was there to serve and has fine dining experience. Just wish it was consistent, as some were too busy chatting amongst themselves to check in on their tables.  I always recommend this place,  as they have good products and price points, and service is usually on point, so hopefully this is a one off."}
{"text":"Went there for Saturday brunch, and had a great time there. Service was great and the food was amazing! Food was ready in a timely manner, and the atmosphere was nice. Recommended."}
{"text":"5 stars for the pastries and coffee shop section - one of the best pain au chocolat (some call them chocolate croissants) in the city.   3 stars for the restaurant - the usual ok-yet-overpriced King West food you've grown to expect on King West."}
{"text":"Came here on a cold winter day looking for a cozy meal..and that is exactly what we got!  We ate: - Fresh ricotta with honey n pears (3/5) This was nice, but was not overly complex or aw-worthy. - Chickpeas and veggies in a harissa sauce (3/5) Again, this was a good compliment to our other dishes, but no wow factor. - Fish crudo (4/5) The fish was super fresh, clean cut, and bright in flavor. Winning - Grilled octopus (4/5) Yummy. The octopus was tender and the sauce it was in was ama-zing (red pepper sauce?) The dish was served at room temperature, would have preferred the sauce to be at least warm.   Ambiance: Super cute place, for groups or dates alike. Bonus points: The music is not blaring so you can actually have a conversation.  I want to give this place one more chance, maybe I should try their brunch!"}
{"text":"This place is more of a scene than a food haven. We arrived at around 9:30 AM on a Saturday morning and grabbed a quick bite from the cafe located at the front of the restaurant. Overall, while the decor is definitely stylish and ambiance is trendy (plus, prime for people-watching), the food is just average. Like, I wouldn't come back here if I wanted a meal to blow my mind, but I'd come back to sit and enjoy the King West vibe.  We ordered a smoked salmon bagel ($8), a croissant ($2.55), a coffee, and a tea. The bagel wasn't anything special; the croissant was light and buttery, but wasn't the best I've had. The food also wasn't as fresh as it could be. The coffee tasted like an average brew (but it's bottomless, so that's a plus), but the tea was nice and comforting.   For two people, we paid around $15.90 at the cafe. The food doesn't equal the best value, but I guess when you're paying for the scene, food isn't at the top of the priority list. Overall, we enjoyed the vibe here, but we'd go somewhere else if we specifically want a tasty breakfast. Also, come early if you're come for the sit-down brunch. By the time we left, a line was forming."}
{"text":"Terribly understaffed for Friday night. We waited over 1.5 hours for food with next to zero service. When I spoke with the manager, Taryn, who proceeded to argue with me why I couldn't have possibly had a poor experience. I recommend finding better management who are capable of listening to customers and hiring extra staff to handle the Friday night rush."}
{"text":"This place deserves a higher rating.  We tried the short ribs, shrimps, and a mushroom salad.  We finished it up with a delicious desert.  They only have one item available for desert and it's mouth watering.   Everthing was great about this place:  the atmosphere, food, service.  It's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I can only comment on a walnut chocolate cookie I bought for take out.  OMG it was fantastic,  maybe the best cookie I have had yet.  Warm,  full of warm chocolate..go for it!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I dined here when the restaurant we intended to visit was closed for their holiday party, what a happy change of plans, we loved this spot. Decor was inviting and trendy, we will definitely be back in the warm months to enjoy their sure to be gorgeous patio on the corner of King and Portland.   As our second Spanish and Tapas inspired restaurant of the trip we were worried our meal would be repetitive but luckily we were mistaken. We started with the candied pork rinds, highly recommended, I could eat these things for lunch, dinner, dessert, 7 days a week. Pork rinds were the perfect little portion and for $4 you can't not get at least one order of them, trust me! The Shrimp pil pil with chili garlic oil was also delectable, served with a side of crostini to sop up all of the delicious spicy sauce, great flavor and portion definitely give this one a try. The Fish crudo with citrus, chili, mango, coriander, and plantain chips was our favorite course of the night, the plantain chips gave a necessary crunch and hit of salt while the beautiful marriage of mango, citrus, and chili danced across our palate  to deliver amazing bite after amazing bite. No matter the daily fish and preparation we WILL be ordering this next time we dine at Portland Variety. For dessert we enjoyed the mille feuille which was delicious but had just a bit more powdered sugar than I think it needed, the dessert was delectable on its own without the over powering sweetness of the powdered sugar garnish.  Definitely give this restaurant a try!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and sat at the bar. Open airy feel and pretty blue ceramic dishes (mine had an octopus on it). I ordered the avocado toast, which was a 3/5 (nothing special). The patatas bravas were excellent. Bartender friendly. I think it would be a nice place for a small crowd to share some plates."}
{"text":"Eating at Portland Variety for the first time was singularly one of the most confusing dining experiences I have ever had, as dinner last night ranged from actually being \"excellent\", before dipping into very disappointing territory.   The meal started great. We were seated comfortably and quickly in the rather charming dining room; our server came by to take our orders within a few minutes. Surrounded by beautiful people and the smell of delicious wafting over from the kitchen, what could go wrong?  Our drinks took a little longer to arrive than we initially expected, but that was fine, given the care the bartender was obviously applying to each cocktail. The names of each cocktail were a bit fancy, ultimately, for what they were - \"Kentucky Trail\" was just a very good Old Fashioned. Being downright yummy however, some pretension was forgiveable.   After ordering five items off their menu (and this number gets very important later in this epic), we were presented with complimentary little servings of squid salads. This gesture was quite impressive, both in terms of quality and the level of customer service I hadn't truly expected.   In quick succession, our orders began to arrive. Decadent Candied Pork Rinds, crisp Fish Crudo, melt-in-your-mouth Carpaccio...an unexpected and unordered second serving of Fish Crudo arrived - apparently, because there was surplus in the kitchen.   So far, the restaurant had the markings of a favourite neighbourhood dinner joint, and we regretted not visiting sooner. Thankfully, we didn't experience said regret for too long.  Like a B-Grade horror movie, suddenly, everything changed. After twenty minutes, our two last orders still hadn't arrived. It kept on not arriving. When we reminded our server, he assured us our remaining food were on their way, only to return after five minutes to inform us that the Cheese Puffs were no longer available, and would we care to change our order now? Obligingly and in good humour, we changed our order.   Except the food kept on not being brought. The server stopped by again to tell us they had never had Sunday night service before, hence the complete lack of organization. That was the last time we spoke to him.   We held on to our patience as long as we could, watching as the staff hurried around all a-fluster; we felt a little sorry for them even. One of the servers dashing to and fro had obviously been recalled from her night off, given that she was decked out in a summer dress (as opposed to the standard black/white uniform).  We watched as the chef, supposedly slammed by the influx of patrons, started chatting up new customers by the doorway. Our server had completely abandoned us by this point in favour of working the front bar. Though I suppose he didn't quite have a choice.   With some difficulty, we finally got the attention of a staff member, who happened to be the Restaurant Manager just passing on by. She snapped \"Yes the Croquetas and Chickpeas are on their way.\"   That's when we asked for the bill.  Without a single word of apology, the receipt arrived - quickly and hilariously with our erstwhile Cheese Puffs still included in the bill.   That five dollar surplus charge, we did not bother contesting. At that point, we just wanted to go some place where we did not feel rendered completely invisible. (That place was Buca, across the street.)  Would we go back? Well the food which had arrived were all very good. I will be thinking about that Fish Crudo.   The question is - should we go back? If you're going to price yourself like a good boutique restaurant, shouldn't you behave like a good boutique restaurant? Is that too much to ask?"}
{"text":"Well, this place is totally worth stopping by in Toronto if you are craving for Mediterranean/Spanish food. Sophisticated decoration with soft colours gives you cozy feeling, then food arrives and turns the place heaven. Of course friendly servers come as angels!   With my friend we started with cocktails. Ginger Smash was great start! Then we shared patata bravas ( sauce is awesome)grilled octopus, piri piri hen, pili pili shrimp and egg bayildi.  As we go further it got better cause the deserts were unforgettable! : tasted all Mille Feuile, Chocolate,and the beignet!   Would definitely go back again to check their patio;)"}
{"text":"Overpriced, small portions, long waits for seats, good service, esthetically pleasing."}
{"text":"*Dinner visit*  Portland Variety is a cool hip restaurant right by King and Portland located in the heart of Toronto's entertainment district. However with some mediocre dishes and poor value for money, I don't think I'll be back any time soon.  Tapas style restaurant means you should come prepared to share but also with a fat cheque book because boy is this place pricey for what you're getting.  I'd recommend trying the Beef Carpaccio, Grilled Octopus, Ceviche and Eggplant. I'd avoid the cheese buns as they were fairly basic imo.  Other reviews indicate Brunch / Lunch might be a different experience!"}
{"text":"Beautifully sunny patio perfect for breakfast! Simply and  delicious kitchen . Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Armed with friends recommendations and reviews, we walked in with a party of 4 for brunch and waited 2 minutes to be seated, I was told that this is not usually the case so I guess it's good because it was a cold morning.  Our wait staff was friendly and routinely checked on us. We ordered fried egg bravas (basic), brioche French toasts, eggs Benedict with sides of bacon, coffee and tea. When our orders came, I was both excited (because they all came looking delicious) and disappointed (because portions was on the small side).   Inasmuch as it tasted good, I wish the portions reflected the price. You get 2 French toasts for the price of $15! Even a glass of wine was $15! I've paid more for wine, but the labels they carried weren't prime.  Would I return? Not sure, there's other brunch places on the same street that I'll try first before returning."}
{"text":"I had a good meal at Portland Variety but it did not wow me at any rate. I would return but I would rather try other places on my list before a return visit is in order...  I ordered the following:  Sticky Lamb Ribs [harissa & maple glaze, spicy peanut brittle] - This was the best item on the table. I really liked these ribs but you only getfour per order and they are supper gamey (beware for those who don't like that sort of thing)  Piri Piri Fried Hen [hot honey glaze]  - This was more like deep fried poultry with sweet & sour sauce - not spicy at all, not really piri piri and a little disappointing  Nikkei Ceviche [striped bass, aji de maracuya, persimmons, taro chips] - Not bad, a little high on the price point for the portions served. We were told it was for two, but I could have eaten this dish as an app on my own  Conclusion: Not a place to spend a dinner, but there are better places out there. Although, I'll have to admit the service was top notch. It definitely improved the dining experience."}
{"text":"NEVER GO THERE AS A LARGE GROUP, AND NEVER TRUST THEIR BAR TENDER.  Food was a 3.5-star, cocktail was a 3-star, but service, -1 star!!! I'm giving a 1-star review entirely because of the service.  My boyfriend had his birthday dinner there on September 18th. He booked a large table for 12 (or more) people several days ahead, but when he walked in on Friday, they said they couldn't find his reservation. But luckily he arrived fairly early so they were able to find make a table for him at that moment.   We ended up having 16 people. Definitely a big group. I understand that this restaurant want to label themselves as 'Spanish tapas style' so they have this 'rule' of 'every dish is shared among the whole table', and I respect this rule. But, HOW CAN YOU SHARE A SPANISH DISH AMONG 16 PEOPLE?! Its not like Korean fried chicken where everybody can have one chicken wing/leg. Its Spanish! Delicious but always in a tiny portion! We tried to explain to the waiter that we have too many people, and asking is it okay to share among smaller groups? For example, split 16 people into 4 or 5 groups (and bills) and share those dishes within these smaller groups. He refused. And insisted that if we want to dine here, we have to follow this rule. Its not like they have a long menu or the portion is big enough for sharing, so eventually we still ordered by each person (or two people as a group), and wasted a lot of time figuring out who ordered what and splitting our bill.   That was still okay. Just annoying. Even though the service was also very slow. Not a big deal. What really made me angry was their attitude toward my boyfriend. He also left a 1-star review here about his most-likely-recycled drink. I'm not going to repeat the story here. He called the restaurant on Monday, spoke to the manager about this. The manager apologized very insincerely as 'I am sorry that you felt in that way, but I don't think our bartender would do this'. He said this can't be true since my boyfriend could not prove it. He also said he would look into this and get back to my boyfriend, but he didn't even ask for a number to call back. And, of course he didn't call back about any follow-up. I can't believe that the manager doesn't even try to restore our confidence toward the restaurant! He doesn't even care how we think of the restaurant and whether we would go back again. No 'sorry I promise this won't happen again'. No 'I promise your next dining experience would be better'. Just gave us the brush-off!   Alright. If you don't care about the reputation of your restaurant, I don't even need to go back and hope things would be different. I would never recommend this restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and was sorely disappointed each time.   What salvages it is the brunch: not the best in the city, mind you, but decent - and certainly worth a visit.   Their dinner, meanwhile, is lacklustre. High prices and meh food combine for a place that I would literally go out of my way to avoid. I find the flavours too strong, and there's too much of an emphasis on salt.  Way overhyped."}
{"text":"A great date night with a surprise at every turn. From the moment you walk into #portlandvariety you have this ambient lighting that gets you excited about what your going to experience. From the buzzing atmosphere to the amazing staff there are no bad choices. We had the #cheesebuns the #cassavafries #cauliflowerpopcorn #eggplant and #gnocchi. The Cassava fries were crispy on the outside with a perfect soft texture on the inside. The gnocchi was as if each one was perfectly pan seared to have a unique taste on its own. I look forward to my next visit very soon. Chef Matty Cowan is amazing with what he has done to the menu and brought some very unique items to our plate."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoy my huevos chicaqules.  Liked that it was in a bowl with tortilla strips....made it so much easier to eat (versus having it all layered on a tortilla shells as I've had other places).  Anyway, the flavors all went well together, the only thing is I could have used more beans and the cheese could have been spread out more. It was buried to one side of the bowl. The dish had small amount of kick, but not so spicy that I couldn't eat it.   Aside from the food, the service was good and friendly, and the wait wasn't too bad for a saturday at 11am (just like 15mins).  All in all, glad I stopped by and would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I had a terrible brunch experience there. We started our order with a Pastry Basket while we waited for the Eggs Benedict and the Fruit Parfait. After a long, long wait, they served the aforementioned Pastry Basket: ONE croissant, a tablespoon of butter and another tablespoon of jam. I was starving and ate it.   They told the table beside me they were having problems with the coffee machine (\"it's broken!\") so I didn't really bother ordering coffee. Just waited, close to one hour, for a simple Eggs benedict and Fruit Parfait. The parfait was good, but not outstanding. My husband could say the same about the Eggs.   I was horrified about how bad was the service, how they had the face to serve ONE croissant as a \"Pastry Basket\" and how average things were for their price. I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Atmosphere, food and servers were great. First time visiting Toronto and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food was just okay, but higher priced. They say its tapas style and should order 2-3 dishes per person. But at about $17 a dish and about $15 a drink: 3 items and a drink is about $66 plus tax and they auto tip for a group as small as 5 people. You're paying quite a bit for a dinner that doesn't make you full.   The service and decor is good and drinks are nice but there wasn't anything memorable enough to make me come back again."}
{"text":"I am in a good mood and feeling generous so I will accord Portland Variety, a restaurant whose name mimics a corner store, 3 stars out of 5.  We ordered the crushed avocado sandwich and a potato appetizer for lunch. The crushed avocado was exactly that with a side of tasteless scrambled eggs. The tastelessness is not so much a criticism as it is a comment. I simply added pepper to my dish. The potatoes were cut into small pieces, topped with mayonnaise and sitting in a bed of salsa-light.  We didn't order drinks as the prices were silly. I suppose that is how most restaurants make money: off their drinks. A glass of fruit juice for $6 is excessive. Perhaps they add Canadian Vodka to it.  Our waiter was OK, but otherwise the service was bad. The man who delivered the food (not our waiter) managed to lose a small portion of our food when it rolled off the plates he placed on the table. He saw it, didn't apologize and moved off. I didn't expect him to offer to replace the lost chunk of food, but how about wiping the table alongside your apology? Nope. This is not Japan... so we tip... to receive rude service.  My friend decided to order another appetizer and asked a woman staff member in uniform. Nope. \"Order that from your waiter,\" she said as she shuffled off. Miss congeniality is surely waiting for her prince to materialize in her life and appreciate her. I am sure she goes home and wonders why men and the universe are so mean to her. After all, she (is sure) deserves nothing less than a millionaire who worships her while she gives him attitude. I have a suggestion for this lady: either you take the order or at least go call our waiter for us. Careless 'service' like this is always congruous with lower tip for me. That night for dinner we went to a Japanese Izakaya where they smiled, bowed every time they delivered the food and even bowed as we left the place.  We ended up not placing the additional order at Portland Variety and just received the bill.    The restaurant is strategically situated so it is quite busy and loud. There is a clean and bright interior and the washrooms are clean. The menu items are limited making Portland variety more of a bar.  On the way out a different girl at the door lifted her head looked at us leaving, looked down again and continued writing whatever she was writing."}
{"text":"The food was pretty tasty the service was so awful that if you pay me to come and eat here I will never come here again.  The portions were small but fine, there's no communications between the server and the bus boy so whatever you order pray to God that you're going to get because me and my husband we left starving and even  we complain to the waiter, he said \"it's not my responsibility\" NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Went to Portland variety with a few friends last night after hearing that it was good. We ordered the bone morrow, the octopus, some fried lobster thing, the carpaccio, some fish thing with mango, the cheese puffs and a lot of beer.     The food was really good. The carpaccio and the bone marrow stood out as the best dishes, but there was nothing I was disappointed with. The staff was friendly and did not rush us at all.   All of us paid about 50 dollars, which includes a 20% tip and had a few drinks and was full. Great value for the quality of food and service. Highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Only went for a sandwich and coffee around 11 but I like the ability to sit in a wide open area and enjoy a light lunch in an environment a lot nicely than a cramped Starbucks. The food and coffee and better too.  The only downfall may be internet (I didn't need it so didn't check) but yelp says negative to wifi.  If so...#whatashame.  I plan to return for some dinner at some point"}
{"text":"A favourite brunch spot!! Coffee is real and very good.  Brunch favourite is the huevos rancheros..so fresh and hearty with a nice kick to them. Generous servings that explode with flavors."}
{"text":"Blueberry pancake and the Fried egg bravas are the best I have ever had . The Croissants are so great! Overall, it's a really nice place only the coffee is so so . But I will definitely go there again ."}
{"text":"We decided to check out Portland Variety for drinks and tapas this weekend. My boyfriend heard good things from a friend so we decided to give it a try.  Upon arrival, the place had a few occupied tables but the waitress said we had to sit at the bar because of reservations an hour later.  I ordered the Tequila Bong which was quite good, but even more fun to watch them make. They fill a bong-like glass with the drink and then fill the rest with smoke from a little machine. The smoke became infused with the liquid as he poured it out into my glass.   We ordered the beef carpaccio and the marrow. My boyfriend was a bit surprised by the former as he didn't realize it would be thin slices of raw meat, on the other hand, I was quite excited for it! The salsa they put on top of it was amazing. I could have ordered another plate.  The marrow was new to both of us so we dont have much to compare it to. We both enjoyed it but I found there could have been more.   For both of us to have a drink and 2 appetizers cost about $35 a person so it is quite expensive. You need to expect that on King West but it would have been nice to order one more thing to completely satisfy us.  The only thing that really bothered us at the end was the amount of tables that were still empty when we left. Sitting at the bar was not truly necessary at all. All and all, we were eating sharable meals and when you do get to sit at the bar, you get to experience the lovely smells that come from the concoctions that are being created behind it. Smoke, sugar, fruit, it was a wonderful experience none the less."}
{"text":"Great option for Brunch with THE BEST pancakes ever! Ordered the Avocado Toast, which comes with poached eggs - which I changed for scrambled - and fresh fruit. The fruit was fresh indeed, different from a lot of other brunch places I've been. The toast was delicious as well. My friend ordered the lemon blueberry pancakes that I got to try and I can honestly say they were the most delicious pancakes I've ever had! Truly recommend."}
{"text":"Came by myself on a Sunday afternoon.  Got seated indoors right away but people were waiting for the patio.   Fried Eggs Bravas ($15) & drip coffee ($2.50). Total w/tax $19.78 (excludes tip).   FOOD: Sunny side eggs \"dressed up\" as something fancy over regular fried breakfast potatoes. The tomato sauce was a nice step up from ketchup. The bacon lardons was basically the fatty part of bacon minus the meat ha! I didn't taste or see the garlic aioli mentioned on menu. The fresh cilantro on top was a nice touch and the smoked paprika! Otherwise not spicy at all.  Coffee was mediocre at best but free refills. Choice of cream or milk. Not sure if non-dairy options available.   SERVICE: Very solid. She gave me time to decide what I wanted and answered my questions albeit a bit impatiently even though not that busy.  My water glass was always full and so was my coffee cup.  I appreciate free wifi.  Sunday's only open until 3 pm for brunch.    AMBIENCE: Loud music (90s-early 2000s eg TLC, Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation, etc...). Nice plates and mugs.  Hard wooden chairs. Dark wood and light coloured tiles.  Patio looks nice with an awning.  Convenient location for King West crowd.   Would I come back? Probably not especially not alone. If I ate here again, it would be nice to share on sweet and one savory dish.   Would I recommend to a friend? No, for $20 ish there are better places to have brunch in the city."}
{"text":"Nice people who respond to special requests and serve tasty food. We've stopped by a couple times and the food is always great, as is the decor/environment, location. Only thing I would like to see them do is expand the menu - we went last week and they basically had the same five options from a year ago - and maybe try to knock the prices down a smidge ;) But I do recommend this place for dates, small groups, or work lunches. Great coffees too!"}
{"text":"I come here probably at least 3 or 4 times a month! My favourite go to!  If you want to come for breakfast on a weekend. Expect to get there 10mins before it opens. Especially on a nice patio day. The breakfasts are all so delicious, but my go to's: avocado toast, eggs with patatas bravas, and the pancakes! By the way, it's sad you cannot buy their coffee, so make sure to get a couple fills of it, it's so amazing and fresh!   Going for dinner feels like going to a entire different restaurant; amazing but different. It's tapas so bring friends.   Also there bakery at the front is very good as well."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch on Saturday and it is quite descent. The egg benny were on a croissant made in house and I ordered a side of potato brava which was quite tasty. The portions are small but it is typical Toronto downtown prices. My eggs benny came with a side of fruit and any sides costs an extra $6. Therefore, with a drink my total bill came to be around $30 after taxes and tips which is pricey for breakfast. But I guess that is the price to pay eating in downtown Toronto these days."}
{"text":"The place was pack for brunch. The hostess did a great job to start the vibe. She had every reason to not great you with a smile due to a woman asking her every 2 min if her table was ready yet.  The great staff continued once we sat down with a polite and upbeat waiter. We ordered the huevos and beans (amazing) & attempted to order the pancakes but they had no more batter??? How do you run out of batter?! So I went with the recommendations of the french toast. Must say I was disappointed they didn't have the pancakes but the French toast was fluffy and cooked to perfection. We will definitely be back. I hope to enjoy the pancakes."}
{"text":"Service was awful. Super slow! Definitely takes away from the pretty interiors and simple but tasty food. I will never go back here and never recommend it to anyone. Maybe for takeout... But for the price you could get better quality and quantity elsewhere.  Memorable takeaways: - Waiting 10 minutes for the hostess to appear - Waiting more than 15 minutes for our drinks (we got them after finishing our salads) - Less than a pint of beer in a serving - pretty sure it is a legal requirement to state the quantity on the menu - Hair in friend's meal - 20 minute wait after paying the bills for the manager to come address the hair issue - this finally happened when we were on our way out, because we were so sick of waiting!"}
{"text":"This place indeed is a Mecca for hipsters and gourmet delicious food. The ambiance is refreshing and the music is artsy Fartsy :-)  I ordered their Black Kale salad for $11.00. It had the right amount of goat cheese, dressing, and hazelnuts...it was so tasty and intoxicating it took my brain on a roller coaster ride!  I also ordered their jasmine green tea, which had the right amount of steam, flavour, and aroma to bring my brain right back from my Kale roller coaster ride into enjoying the upbeat King West vibe!  Portland Variety from now will always be my One and only Kale Crush :-D"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try Portland Variety, and last week I finally made the plunge. It was rather quiet but it was on a weeknight with winterlicious still going on (they did not participate), so reservations were not really necessary.  The decor spells \"business casual\", but I was perfectly comfortable wearing casual clothing. The drinks are on the pricier side and they are definitely asking for too much for wines by the bottle. Fortunately for me the beer there is priced reasonably, and there was a good IPA on tap.   Our server informed us that the dishes are meant to be shared, and are on the smaller side. Since the price of these items are priced like a regular entree, I feel that they are asking for a few dollars too much. We decided to order 4 dishes for the two of us.  We shared a Winter Greens salad, which tasted fine until I noticed that there were pomegranate seeds in it (not listed as an ingredient on the menu), which gave a very unplesant crunch with the angel hair collard greens.   The eggplant byaldi was just ok, there was nothing special about it.  We then had the whole cornish hen, which came with piri piri sauce. We thought the hen was  done well and tasted good, and liked the veggies and farro that accompanied it.   The grilled octopus was also done well and had a spicy kick to it, perhaps too much. I was pleased that is was not over-done and was very tender.  During our meal, a person working in the kitchen (I am guessing the head chef) decided to yell at one of the line cooks for not being on top of their game/not paying attention/..something. There were quite a bit of expletives and me and my friend thought it was quite unprofessional. This went on for a good 5 minutes and it interrupted our conversation and made us uncomfortable. The server was nervously looking at our direction and definitely know we are hearing all of it.  All in all, despite having an ok cornish hen and octopus dish, Portland variety did not win me over and I don't feel it is worth the price. The two of us had one drink each and 4 dishes and the bill came to $140 (tax, tip included). If it was around $120 it would have been more reasonable (and really, they should have thrown in the drinks for the drama we had to listen to).  Meh"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but after a 15 minute wait for a take-out salad that amounted the a handful of arugula and 12 mushrooms (yup I counted) I was less than impressed - especially for $13. So many better options in the area."}
{"text":"We came here around 11 and waited about 20 mins.  They are really busy for weekend brunch but quick turnaround with efficient servers.   I ordered the eggplant bayaldi while my husband ordered the fried eggs Brava. I thought the eggplant was nicely cooked but it was very oily. My husband thought his dish was just ok, the Combination of flavours on his dish didn't jive well together.   Overall, it was an ok experience for us, nice ambience, great service but mediocre food taste."}
{"text":"Nice place for Sunday brunch! The portions are perfect for one! Don't miss out the creme with pistachio and peach!"}
{"text":"Their lattes & famous La Gourmand cookies are my fav and I've done brunch here several times & more times than not, they've done a great job - quick friendly service and great dishes! (My most recent visit, the croissant that came along with the poached eggs was not as fresh as they usually are but all else were fine).  My fav brunch dish is the huevos but the others, especially the pancakes and french toast are not far behind.  Ill always be a loyal patron so long as their coffee and cookies don't change!"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch this morning for the first time with a friend. We only had to wait about 10 minutes, which was great considering how popular brunch is in Toronto!   I ordered the avocado toast with scrambled eggs, which also came with a side of fresh fruit. Everything was delicious! I thought the service could have been better though, our waiter wasn't very friendly. Otherwise, a very cute brunch spot with many great options!"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunchbased on a friend recommendation. The menu is simple enough, some starters, some sandwiches, salads and a handful main dishes to choose from. I went for Piri Piri Chicken Sandwich ($15) and my friend picked Mushroom Salad ($18). The portions were really small. ANd the salad...You expect it to come in a deep bowl but no, on a regulat plate, with some mushroom and cheese hidden under arugula leaves. The price-performance ratio for this meal was close to %20.  I also ordered Erdinger however I highly doubt it was an Erdinger ($8). It wasn'T cloudy, nor had the proper banana and citrusy flavours in it. I could swear they served a Pilsner. Or at least the beer was probably from the bottom of the keg.  The place is spacious and had many tables outside. Hlaf of them were under the sun, so the place obviously lacks some parasol. The reason I did not give 1 star is our server, who was very kind and respectful."}
{"text":"This place is located in the heart of trendy King West neighbourhood. The interior design, choice of plates and everything else about it fits in with the rest of the neighbourhood. My friend and I spent about $90 +tax & tips for 7 items, including salads, appetizers and dessert. The last one probably wasn't such a good idea, because I had indigestion afterwards, but otherwise, the food was pretty good. I'm not really used to the type of food they serve, because it usually leaves me feeling hungry, but I was quite full afterwards. Our waitress was quite attentive, so I don't have any complaints with regard to the quality of service. Their chocolate mouse is definitely worth trying.  Bottom line: would I go back? Mmmm, probably not in the immediate future. Next time I'm in the neighbourhood, I'd check out Gusto 101 or some other place in that area that I haven't been to already."}
{"text":"I came here on a rainy, windy, cloudy Toronto day. I got soaked but it was worth it - Portland Variety was a delight. It's a really beautiful, comfy, pleasant place. I came here for lunch on a biz meeting and ordered a beer to start (priorities!), an arugula salad and flank steak sandwich, and finished it with an espresso. Everything came smoothly and in a timely manner from our friendly server. The food was very tasty and quite filling. I'm a fan, this place is nice."}
{"text":"This is really a 2.5. My experience here was okay at best. We ordered the bikini sandwich (tasty but oily), the oxtail gnocchi (tasty!) and the bone marrow.   Man. Prior to this I've had bone marrow one other time at a different restaurant and recall it being absolutely delicious - I couldn't get enough. This time, I was disappointed to find it flavourless and pretty disgusting to eat. The texture was like fish fat and when I took a bite of it with bread oil dripped down my chin. My mom and I both couldn't bring ourselves to finish it.  I admittedly am not a bone marrow expert, but I can't imagine people enjoying the dish we were given. Other than that, service was decent - I'd say it met expectations for how much this place costs."}
{"text":"I went for dinner with my friend to Portland Variety. We heard great things about this place and wanted to try it. We ordered a pitcher of sangria to share. Sangria wasn't bad but also not the best. This place is basically small tapas to share. It was quite expensive. We had the meat balls which was ok. Not the best I had. Also shared a prosciutto grilled cheese sandwich it was good but not worth $16 for a tiny sandwich! Also ordered the polenta fries it was delicious because I never had it before. Was not impressed with the quality of the overall food price .The price was steep for the tiny portion. Service was great and food was decent but too expensive and would not come back."}
{"text":"This review is for the brunch.    The place is elegant and hip.  It's quite popular for brunch.  Even the bar is quite busy with patrons sipping mimosa and Caesar.    The food is good.  The huervos with chorizo, baked beans and cheese was very tasty.  It had a nice light heat.  The ricotta pancakes are exceptionally moist and delicious.  The omelette with mushroom was a little lacklustre.     The elegant linen napkins and nice chinaware adds to the charm.  The service is very friendly.  My only complaints are that the portions are small and they don't take reservations for brunch."}
{"text":"Despite the last and only other time I've been here, decided to give it another try.  Last time was a bad experience right off the bat because we were left waiting at the front hostess stand for 5-7 minutes.  No acknowledgement or welcome or words from any of the several servers rushing by.  The bartender miraculously managed to not even make eye contact for the entire time despite on 2 people sitting at the entire bar.  This time I'm happy to say that I was seated inside right away.  But sat for 10 minutes without a hello or even a glass of water.  Perhaps because I've put in many hard years working in the service industry, I'm a harsh critic.  But it is what it is.  The food was decent to good ... but it really doesn't matter when it is delivered with lackluster service."}
{"text":"Eggs Benny coissant is unreal. May never eat Eggs Benny on an English muffin again.   Pancakes with delicious compote. Thicker pancakes, brilliantly cooked, light and fluffy inside, crisp outside.   Very impressed. This place does breakfast special."}
{"text":"There are 2 good things about Portland Variety: 1) Their cocktails 2) Their interior  Either than the above two, I've had horrible experiences with their service and their food. I've been there 3 times and my food took way too long, so long that my food came out cold - all 3 times. And trying to get the servers' attention was nearly impossible - even when the restaurant only had 2 other tables.  I wish I had better experiences at this place, because it's so cute inside and I live 2 blocks away, but I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"With a great location in King West, the opportunity here is gold. But whether it's King West Kitchen or the rebranded Portland Variety it is still a huge miss. Overall, the service is terrible - getting a simple coffee is a huge ordeal and the servers have some serious attitude issues. They have a huge sandwich board in the front bakery section but you can't get the majority of them unless you are dining in. The sandwiches they have pre-made just sit there on the counter all day long uncovered in the open air with nothing to protect them from being sneezed or coughed on which is ridiculous. I have tried their flagship chocolate chip cookies twice, and both times they were raw in the middle. Some days they have a breakfast wrap and some days they don't? Trying to be a tapas bar, a brunch spot, a bakery and evening dining is a bad idea if you can't get even one of them right. Go to Bar Buca across the street.......everything is much better than this mish mash operation Portland Variety. The only positive thing I can say is the design/look of the restaurant itself is quite nice."}
{"text":"Service was incredible. We pretty much Tried everything on the menu for dinner and it was all delicious!"}
{"text":"Been here twice for brunch very meh. I've ordered the eggs benny and the avo toast and it tastes very underwhelming. The avocado came sandwiched between 2 pieces of supposed sourdough bread and there was no salt, pepper or any seasoning. The toast wasn't toasted and by the end of my meal the avocado and egg were a soggy mess.   Service wasn't great, our waiter at the end of our meal had a hard time splitting the bill properly by seat and took a long time to come around even though the restaurant wasn't busy at that point.   I definitely would avoid this place, nothing special unfortunately."}
{"text":"Stopped here for brunch and was pleasantly surprised. The service was quick and friendly, outdoor seating was nice and the food was tasty. I recommend the French toast and pancake dishes. The prices weren't high either. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"grabbed a coffee here. Sit and relax in the patio. You Will get busy Toronto street view Lol"}
{"text":"I dropped by Portland Variety not for their restaurant but simply for their coffee. My friends and I were looking for a cafe to sit at on a rainy day and came across Portland Variety. However, there is not much seating space in the cafe as it is a quick grab and go but we were able to sit at the one table that was in the middle. Was kind of inconvenient since I felt like people were just walking around us.   I got an Iced Latte which I thought was good and reasonably priced compared to other cafes. One thing that I saw in common within many reviews was that their cookies were really good. I was planning to purchase one later on but while I was sitting I saw a lady purchase 8 cookies and I knew I had to buy one before they were sold out. The cookie was perfect. It was soft but not too soft and the crust of the cookie was great. 10/10 would buy again!   Overall, it was a super cute place and I would visit again to try the restaurant portion which seemed aesthetically pleasing."}
{"text":"I don't give one-star reviews often, but really my experience at this restaurant just baffled me. I can't even comment on the quality of the food... because I didn't have any, so this comment is solely for the service and experience. My friend and I popped in here on a Friday night because we were actually just waiting for a table at a different restaurant down the street. While we had no intentions of having a full on meal here, we decided to grab some cocktails and maybe some small snacks. We were basically ignored when we walked in, one waiter waved at us and said someone would be with us shortly, but we stood around waiting for close to 10 minutes before another person even acknowledged our presence. I glanced around as the waitress led us in, and the place wasn't even full, there were tons of empty tables available at around 6 PM. We were seated at a table for two in the back corner and given menus to look at... then basically left alone for another 20 minutes. No one came to introduce ourselves, no one came to take our orders, no one even came to fill our water glasses. We couldn't wave down anyone's attention, and there were employees just standing around not doing anything, so I didn't really understand what was going on. FINALLY, after my friend and I decided to stop chatting to each other and just put on the bitchiest faces while looking around, a waitress came by and we ordered our drinks. Skipped out on snacks because we were scared that we would have to wait another 30 mins. Our drinks did come fairly quickly after we ordered, so I will give the restaurant credit for that. However, soon afterwards my friend and I had to leave, so then came the struggle of getting the bill. Our waitress was busy washing dishes or something, and wouldn't even look up at us. Soon afterwards she disappeared out onto the patio and then was basically never seen again. Other waiters in the restaurant saw us clearly waving and trying to grab her attention and just chose to go about their business and completely ignore us! It was ridiculous - pretty much the vibe there seems to be: just serve your own assigned tables and ignore everyone else. Honestly, most frustrating experience ever. I don't think I will ever return to this restaurant, because I doubt the food will be amazing enough to compensate for the absolutely appalling service."}
{"text":"Pretty, old school touch and feel. The dim candle lighting is a major win for the romantic side. Enjoyed the high top pincushion, faux ostrich seating across from the bar. Some of the most comfortable seating I've come across in a long time. There's also outside seating for those who want to stay in the mix. Pretty inside bar - loved the hung high bottles surrounding it. The general ambiance is Edison light bulbs lit with dim lighting. Marble topped white tables. It's like a restoration hardware ad but prettier.  Kentucky trail - smokey citrus, it smelled incredible and the taste came through too. Outstanding and the best cocktail we had in Toronto.  Standard Lambrusco- always a chilled sparkling wine, it's hard to go wrong with. This one was on par.  Rhubarb-sage panna cotta - lovely in appearance, a bit strong I the flavor of sage but it's an interesting combination with the tart rhubarb. A real favorite of mine. The panna cotta was rich, creamy and delicious addition. The rhubarb perfectly ripe and sweet in its own way.   Giving it 5 stars despite the moody hostess. Loved this place!"}
{"text":"Walked around King Street and we saw this place on Yelp decided to come through to have a little breakfast before hitting the bluffs. Job well done. There was a 30 minute wait but it was nice because the server got down our name and number so they texted us once the table was ready FOOD: My friends ordered the patatas bravas and I ordered the crushed avocado on toast with fruits. The fruits were really fresh, came with melons and some berries. The avocado toast was lightly buttered and had quite a portion of avocado, it had a nice bite and crunch to it, just what to expect from a nice piece of warm toast. Fluffy scrambled eggs came with my order too, great by themselves but even yummier with the bread. Great all in all.  SERVICE: Service was good, waiter was attentive and all, but strange because she would never look at us directly when speaking to her. Very nice though when we told her we were from out of town. It was also very nice that we never ran out of water and utensils were quick to replace.  ATMOSPHERE: You get a rustic hip vibe coming to this place with the interior and the exterior graffiti along the outside, hearing The Weeknd as you eat a piece of toast.   All in all, good place to stop by for some brunch or breakfast, i'll be sure to stop by next time I visit."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Thursday night. It was pretty empty around 6:30pm, but started getting busy around 7pm. My friend and I ordered 4 tapas to share - the bone marrow (so delicious), croquetas, hippie salad (also very good!) and cassava frites. Service was prompt and friendly. It was hard to get around the tables though when it got busy, as we were sitting right in the corner. Overall, great vibe but I personally wouldn't pay around $60 for 4 tapas plates...it wasn't that amazing. Won't be back for dinner, but definitely will be back to try the baked goods and perhaps brunch."}
{"text":"Great spot with killer bartenders. The big patio is a nice addition in th summer too. We go here often in the summer and their cocktails and snacks (cheeses) are just fabulous. Service is always good and quick to be seated."}
{"text":"What to try??  Come here for their brunch and sit on the patio. I recommend the Avocado smash and toast!  I liked that the toast came with scrambled eggs and the avocado tasted just right with the toast. The arugula salad was also very simple but it was still tasty. The arugula salad had a simple olive oil and lemon juice mix with some freshly shaved Parmesan cheese. Overall, it was a simple breakfast but it was really filling.   My friend had the chicken sandwich and it looked really tasty too.   I have to say the prices can be a bit on the pricey end though. I ordered a glass of fresh orange juice and a glass of the juice cost $6!   It's nice to sit by the patio especially when this restaurant is located on a busy street, King street!   Last tip?  Come during lunch time to enjoy the sun and the nice Patio they have. Before you order fresh pressed orange juice, Make sure you're aware of the price and is comfortable with the price you're paying!!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a rainy day (which is too bad, because I would've loved the patio). It was quite busy on a Sunday morning, but luckily for us, we didn't wait too long to be seated. I liked the decor - typical King West fancy with a dash of hipster charm. The plates and cups were adorable and reminded me of something I could buy from Anthropologie.   I had the smashed avocado toast with sourdough and scrambled eggs. I am crazy for the whole avocado toast trend and this one was delicious, although something tells me that it would taste even better if it came with a few slabs of bacon on top. A tiny fruit salad is also included, which is a nice touch.   My bf had the eggs benedict with ham on a croissant. Again, this was accompanied by a small fruit salad. The eggs benny was good, although nothing to write home about. It's one of the less unique items on the brunch menu.   I find that the portions here are quite small - which I don't mind that much but I can see how some people wouldn't be full. I was tempted to order a pastry basket to top off my brunch (but resisted). A couple of other things on the menu also caught my eye (like the hazelnut praline french toast... which sounds absolutely heavenly), so I think I will be back to try some other dishes on a sunny day!"}
{"text":"Portland Variety is a very popular brunch place in the Fashion District. It opens early for coffee and pastries on the weekend, but brunch service does not start until 10am. The restaurant starts filling up pretty quickly once the doors open, so go early if you want to not wait.   The aesthetic and interior of the brunch spot is very appealing and it is a nice place to grab brunch with friends and have a drink or two on the weekend. However, the actual food is very underwhelming and overhyped. It is very well-plated and photographs amazingly, but the actual taste and overall flavors are not very good.   Food:  Fried Egg Bravas - Basically fried egg with thick bacon pieces on top of a bed of potatoes with sauce on top. The egg was blackened on the bottom from a pan that was probably scorched and the potatoes had a terrible flavor of excessive starchiness and bitterness. Not really sure how they messed this dish up so badly, but I could barely eat any of those potatoes without a heaping of sauce on top. It looks 10x better than it tasted. Lemon Ricotta Blueberry Pancakes - Very thick fluffy stacks of pancake with ricotta blueberry sauce and lemon curd on the side. I wished there was a lot more lemon and tang to cut the sweetness of the pancakes, but my friend who had ordered them seemed to enjoy them a lot.   Overall, the food was pretty disappointing and I would not come again, but we got some pretty good pictures in the meantime."}
{"text":"Can you update your hours of operation on here please! Other than that, perfect food and pastries! Best cookies in the world....sorry mom."}
{"text":"Like it and would recommend it. Friendly staff. Delicious food. Good selection of wine and cocktails.   Check it out.   Favourite dish - steak and bone marrow!"}
{"text":"Portland variety is a staple in my neighbourhood. I've only actually sat down once to eat for brunch, but definitely plan on returning, however sometimes it's hard to get a table without a wait! Shows how good it is :) the interior is beautiful and the staff are very nice. I went in the other day just to try a cookie and oh my god I have no words. F***ing amazing. Sorry I had to :p"}
