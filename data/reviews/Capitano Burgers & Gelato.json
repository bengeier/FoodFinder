{"text":"i quite like this place. Their Capitano burger is rather good - one of the better burgers in the city (and i consider myself an expert on the subject!)  i was less impressed with their gelato - when i had it, it was a little gummy, which may mean it's not very fresh (?)  They also don't carry my favourite flavour, baccio.  Kind of a drag.

i've only had their fries once because they were nothing spectacular, and i haven't been back since they received a conditional yellow DineSafe pass. So why 4 stars?  That burger, man.  That's a tasty burger."}
{"text":"Tastiest burger in the area. Delicious gelato. I like The Ringer burger. Also I found that the bun was very fresh. I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Captiano's about three or four times this month. It's located less than a 5 minute walk from the Bloor and Yonge subway station.

I find their burgers more filling than Burger's Priest. Their burgers may not be as juicy as Burger's Priest, but it's still a better value for my money. They use good quality beef - no fillers or preservatives.

The next time I am there, I will try the Ringer burger.

If you order eat-in, they will bring you your food to where you are seated. The staff are friendly and while you're eating, you can watch movies on a big screen TV."}
{"text":"The location was relatively empty when two friends and I dropped in on a Wednesday evening.

Had Capitano's Monster burger combo and a scoop each of their Bacio and Salted Hazelnut ice cream. The burger combo was somewhere between $10-$11 and I got a free sample cup of ice cream for checking in on the Yelp app. The Monster burger was delicious and the deep fried cheese stuffed portobello mushroom brought it up several notches. The burger's size was huge and the side of fries was a healthy portion. Having snacked on a small wrap a couple hours before I had trouble finishing off the combo. I had to cut my burger in half to keep the burger to bun ration acceptable because there was a lot of slipping going on so I would suggest you do the same.

The Bacio ice cream tasted exactly like Ferrero Rocher chocolates and the Salted Hazelnut played on that sweet/salty thing which was amazing. Definitely a place I would recommend you try at least once."}
{"text":"At any burger place, IMO, after all the gimmicks and flourishes, it really just comes down to the burger. Capitano is no exception. 

After going through the menu I settled on the Blue Lagoon -- a very enticingly described burger with a juice beef patty, blue cheese, fried egg, saut√©ed mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, BBQ sauce, capitano sauce. Needless to say it was VERY flavourful and the fried egg added a lovely dimension to the whole thing. And the blue cheese. Oh the blue cheese. The best part? It's under $10 with tax. I think that given the ingredients that's a pretty good deal. 

As for the Gelato part of their business, I was satisfied too. Personally the gelato burger did not appeal to me, but I loved their selection of house-made gelati and it really rounded out the meal very well.

All in all, I highly recommend it to anyone looking to try something new in the Yonge & Bloor area and not spend a ton in the process."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love the bread, the amazing combinations they have to offer, and the service. And oh my the gelato!!!! The only thing I don't really like here,is their poutine fries, but the onion rings sure make up for it!"}
{"text":"By far, my favorite burger place. I always order their mushroom melt and my partner orders the Canadian banquet. We also get the almond gelato for dessert. After eating their burgers, it's hard to eat burgers anywhere else. It takes a while for the orders compared to fast food places because they make them fresh which is why the burgers taste so good. The people are so friendly here too!"}
{"text":"I was too full after my meal to try their gelato, although it was pretty popular; a lot of people came just for the gelato, so it must be good.

I had the Capitano ($5.50), which has cheese and house sauce in addition to lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions. You can ask to exclude any of the toppings, if you wish. For 3.50, you can make it a combo; you get a drink (you just grab any can or water bottle from the freezer behind you), and a choice of onion rings, fries or gelato.

I think the size of their burger is similar to a Hero burger, maybe not as tall, but definitely the lack in height is made up in circumference. 

The buns are made in-house, so it has that home-baked taste. The bread doesn't stick to the roof of your mouth like the other franchise buns (McD, BK), and it's fluffy and moist. 

You get a lot more meat than the franchise burgers, but not as much as Hero? The meat is better than the standard patty you would get at McD or BK though...you can actually \"see\" the meat after you bite into the patty, as opposed to the super-finely ground-then-pressed-together-patty.
The cheese wasn't the nasty plastic Kraft Singles cheese, yay. I don't think the house sauce was anything special, to be honest...Overall, the burger was really good. 

Onion rings are so so crispy, I think they double fry?  Yummmmm.
The fries are simple; no extra batter or crisp added. Just some McCain style cut potatoes, paprika sprinkles, salted nicely, very good. Not crunchy or crispy, but very good.  

They have a lot of interesting signature burgers that I'd like to try next time. I'll definitely be back!

They have a 10% student discount, btw, so just tell the cashier when you order. The cashier will ask for your name, and when your order comes out, instead of shouting your name for you to pick it up, the cashier brings it to your table."}
{"text":"Gelato was the best i've ever had in Toronto. Burgers were delicious!!!
I'm so happy I found this place, I'm gonna eat there everyday. The service was also outstanding, 5 Stars all the way!!!!!"}
{"text":"Overall, I would give it 4 stars for the burgers and 5 stars for the gelato. The burgers are pretty good but are slightly over done. The gelato is great. Especially the burger and gelato combo."}
{"text":"Maybe this was an off night for this place but the burgers were average.. The kind you could totally make at home yourself. Also had the onion rings, I love my onion rings but these were mediocre at best, over fried and lacked taste. Doubt I'll visit this place again"}
{"text":"I went into Capitano Burgers & Gelato this evening and was super impressed!  From the outside you might not think much of it and otherwise just pass it by, but on the recommendation of a friend, Jenn N, (holla! I know you're reading this) I decided to try it out.

I ordered the Canadian Banquet - eh? With toppings including the usual - lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion, and then the good stuff - bacon and cheese!  The burger was simply mouth-watering! This place is known for their all-natural ingredients and hormone & antibiotic free meat, and you could really taste the difference.  Also the organic baked in-house bun is a fresh and delicious touch. About halfway through the burger I started feeling upset, this was too good and I was NOT ready for it to end. I took small bites for the remainder of the burger and savoured it, secretly planning when I could come back next. 

Next up, I had to try the gelato. Coming from an Italian background I am usually a bit skeptical in trying my homeland ice cream, but at the first taste test of the Salted Caramel gelato it was hook, line and sinker!  YUMM!  I would definitely recommend the Salted Caramel and the PB & J. To be honest, I pretty much love pb&J in every shape and form and this gelato did NOT disappoint!

Additionally.. I found the servers were incredibly personable and friendly. They were chatty with the customers and happy to provide samples of the gelato flavours.  The only issue is that now it's so much harder to decide - guess it will be one of each please!"}
{"text":"Decided to check it out the other day for lunch. Prices are pretty fair considering it's a gourmet burger joint, and with my student discount in effect, I couldn't complain! My hamburger was well seasoned and cooked, overall pretty damn tasty! Comes with a rather large bun, but thankfully fresh and no where near stale.

Fries were a bit overseasoned, but still made a nice side dish. I also was offered a small snack size order of gelato. Some of the best gelato I've tried in Toronto. Some really unique flavors, and it makes a nice dessert after burgers and fries.

I'll be back again to try it out a second time!"}
{"text":"My daughter wanted a good burger and we decided to try this out today. We got the Capitano burger, vegetarian burger and the chicken burger combos. You have an option to get either the fries or gelato with a combo for $3.50 more. I would recommend to get the combos and we got both the fries and the gelato. The burgers were amazing and great quality and the gelato was out of the world. Would come back again and again and costed us $27.10 for the 3 of us...wow what a bargain compared to some other burger joints I have been to."}
{"text":"I've gone twice and my experiences were very inconsistent. I had the Capitano burger and fries both times.

The first time, my burger was noticeably overcooked and dry. The fries were also well-done, but quite good - they appeared to be fresh.

The second time, my burger was perfect - juicy, flavourful and meaty. It was probably one of the better burgers around - better than Five Guys or the much-ballyhooed Burger's Priest. But my fries were awful - greasy, undercooked (yes, this time they were undercooked) frozen McCain Superfries.

If they could figure out some consistency, this would be my go-to place for a burger downtown."}
{"text":"This place WOW'd me with their customer service, and the burgers were fantastic.
A young man, who I suspect was the owner, made our \"quick snack\" into something special. He was so enthused and passionate about burgers and you could really taste it in the food.

Not only that, he gave us a free taste of their home made ice cream as we were leaving.

Since moving back to Canada from New York, I have not seen service like that at a place that wasn't considered fine dining."}
{"text":"Best Burger & Gelato Place. Period.

Their staff is very friendly and they bring you your food!

Ok, so I have been to couple of burger places. Sometimes the burgers are decent but the price they usually charge fo them is ridiculous. But Capitano has some of the best priced burgers I have ever tasted. I can eat them everyday and never get tired of it.

And they serve gelato! I had Rose gelato one day and fell in love with gelato. I never liked frozen yogurt or \"gelato\", always thought it was rich man's ice cream, Capitano has turned me into a Gelato lover. I can't even have normal ice cream now after tasting their gelato. On top of that, they are not cheap with their gelato, I asked for a medium and they gave me a tower full of gelato. I have noticed other places give you very little compare to what these guys give you. 

Everytime I go there, they have new people coming in and they rave about how good their burger was, that they would come again and bring their friends. I am not the only one who finds them awesome. (Plus you can draw on their whiteboard, which is always a bonus for me.)

Now for what they serve and how good it is. 
I have had these burgers up until now:
Mushroom Melt - (This is the best vegetarian burger I have ever had, did not know you could make a vegetrain burger taste this good. It is the portbello mushroom cheese patty)
Canadian Banquet - (This is best for a hangover type of situation, I usually get extra bacon with this burger)
Spicy Burger - (This is a great burger to have if you like spicy burgers)
The Ringer - (This burger is huge and so full-filling)
Wild Burger - (This burger melts in your mouth, you can taste the goat cheese and the sauteed mushrooms are a delight)
The Master - (This burger is a must have, especially if you are really hungry. Even though it has two huge patties and I had some trouble eating it, I would never stop getting this burger!)

For their sides, I love their onion rings. I am not a fries person so I never order poutine or fries but I have overheard people say that they have great poutine.

My favourite gelatos: Rose, Pistachio, Almond and Bueno!
I was shocked when I saw Rose and I felt like a small kid having ice cream for the very first time when I had Rose with Pistachio. 

I have brought lots of my friends and coworkers and they all love this place. One of them is vegetarian and he told me it is really hard to find good food for him because either they only have salad which is not enough or some boiled vegetable stuff. He was so happy to have found this place, he is now always getting a burger from them.

If you do not believe me, please go see it for yourself. I assure you that you will not regret."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover, or in this case, a restaurant by it's interior design. This place totally looks like a diner, a place where one would consume burgers, fries, and all sorts of other fried indulgences, but Gelato?!?!?!

Who knew Burgers and Artisanal Gelato sold together would make for a lucrative business?!

Truth be told, I thought they were selling Gelato Burgers (i.e. Gelato stuffed between Brioche). When I overcame my disappointment, I decided that Gelato in a cup would do.

The girl behind the counter was very friendly and offered samples. I tried the Butternut Squash (very interesting) and Avocado (super creamy and rich) before deciding on Mojito and a traditional Hazelnut.

The Mojito was divine. Made my lips pucker, and had a refreshing mint flavour. The Hazelnut was chock full of crushed nuts, which I loved! Great textural contrast with the smooth gelato.

If I'm ever in this hood and jonesing for a frozen treat, I know where to go!"}
{"text":"So sad you cannot add the PLUS symbol. This place is great. Real burgers with amazing taste. Definitely my #1 place from now on."}
{"text":"The gelato is great! So far my favorite in Canada. It's not so sweet and keep the original flavor. Once I tried the spicy burger.  I usually don't like burger, but that time I like the whole thing including the bun and the beef and the sauce!"}
{"text":"Totally awesome burger!  Buns are fresh baked on location. This is my new go to burger joint. Doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"Man the veggie burger I ordered was goooodddd! But my fries were not (which was disapointing and not worth it since I ate them anyways) super greasy and soggy ...although the soggyness might have been due to me getting it to go and walking 8mins with it in a bag in the winter. Not sure though."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to start.  I went to this place this weekend with 3 more families and there was not even one complaint. My \"pepito\"  (a Venezuelan steak sandwich) took some time to be prepared because y decided to wait for the buns (oh! the bun!) that were on the oven and I have to say it was totally worth it. It's home made and tastes really fresh. My husband tried the Capitano burger and it was delicious! Juicy and full of flavour. The \"teque√±os\"  (kind of cheese sticks) and empanadas were amazing and the mojito gelato was one on the most surprising flavours I recently tasted. The staff is super friendly!  It's going to be my new burger place for sure!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back to this place.

Gelato, burgers
Burgers, gelato

Good onion rings and good fries. So rare to do both well

I've developed a new crush on the banquet burger. It is epic.

The tree hugged in me also likes that it's a solid meal under $10 AND it's all grass-fed hormone free meat. Makes this cow very happy."}
{"text":"Capitano Burgers & Gelato has two of my favourite things:
1) Burgers!
2) Gelato!

I've been tempted time and time again by the sign stating:
Burgers! Gelato!

Today, I gave in and I have no regrets.

I really appreciate the fact that all the ingredients are locally sourced.
Even though burgers and gelato might not be the best foods for you, 
Capitano serves up these eats as clean, fresh, and natural as possible.

If you get a regular burger, you can top it as you please.
The price is fair at $4.95 - $5.95.
Beef, chicken, haddock, or soy patty.

I'm pretty lazy when it comes to burger toppings, I generally go with burgers that are dressed up for me.  The dressed burgers range in price ($6.50 to $8.50) 

The Capitan burger was my burger of choice and one of the most popular.
It was $8.50 + $3.50 to make it a combo.
* The burgers are a perfect size
* The fresh baked organic flour bun was fresh and chewy
* The horemone-anitbiotic-free angus beef burger patty itself was tasty but slightly overcooked.
* The deep friend portabello mushroom-cheese patty wasn't as crispy as I would have liked on the outside and not very cheesy but not bad

The gelato is made in-house and it surprised me!
It looked a bit melty in the display, but very thick and firm once cupped.
The pistachio had chunks of nuts, the coconut still had yummy coconut bits.
I like how it wasn't completely smoothly blended.  It was more fun to eat.
The size small is pretty small though.
Gelato has no additives and the fruit flavours are dairy free.

The owner was super friendly and proud of their food.
They mentioned that they want to venture into more adventurous meats, bison and even alligator, but they will see.

Overall, I was very satisfied with my burger...and  I've eaten a lot of burgers.
The poutine here seems promising.

I'll consider ordering it next time when I'm back for burger! gelato!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, Awesome poutine, Awesome Gelato (the honey date one is amazing, like eating a paste of dates yum!)."}
{"text":"The service was great! The burger was just okay... I appreciate that they use fresh, quality ingredients and hormone/antibiotic free beef, but that doesn't really matter much when it's over-cooked. It would have probably been a simple, decent burger; instead it ended up being tough and not that juicy. 

The fries were hand-cut and lightly seasoned (a good thing). But again, they were a little over-done for my taste. Makes them a little too dark and crunchy. I like my fries golden and crisp on the outside, with a soft and fluffy inside. I didn't try their gelato, so I can't comment on that. It looked pretty good, though only about 5 or 6 flavours available. Of course it IS winter, so probably not gelato season for most people!

Overall, it was friendly service, but just an average burger. My search continues...."}
{"text":"Who knew that burgers and gelato could go hand in hand?

Although this place serves fresh, high quality meat in their burgers, the thing that impressed me the most were the home-made buns. You would think that perhaps an in-house burger bun couldn't make that big of a difference but that just means you haven't had a burger at Capitano. The buns were rich, soft and delicious and also full of flavour - it really makes other burger joints pale in comparison when it comes to the bread. It's hard to describe the difference a home-made bun can make for a burger unless you try it yourself!

The gelato flavours are both refreshing and unique, and the staff are friendly and quick. The prices are also very reasonable considering the burgers are essentially gourmet. What else can you ask for?

Overall, I would highly recommend this place as a high quality yet inexpensive burger/gelato joint!"}
{"text":"A weird establishment.  The food is pretty good and made  fresh. 

However the staff and atmosphere drop this from a four star to a two.  They have a disheveled looking old man outside mumbling and handing out coupons. When you go inside the person taking your order is rude and the space feels very cramped.  It is also confusing where to order.  

Too bad the scwarma place shut down..."}
{"text":"A tradition for our friend group. We have been here many times and it has never disappointed. 

The gelato is excellent and the burgers are always fresh. Get the combo for a great deal. 

They have a selection of gourmet toppings but they don't charger the prices you might get at a gastro pub.

The atmosphere is relaxed and casual."}
{"text":"I don't know man... I think I was tasting some blue cheese in my sauce of The Ringer burger, which I totally didn't expect. I had caramelized onions, onion rings, a beef patty, a slice of cheese, tomatoes and lettuce in my patty, which were good, but wow it was heavy and HUGE. I was really full. Like, stuffed uncomfortably. I think it was a bit too heavy for me. but for $6.50, it's not bad. I just don't think it fits my tastes personally.

I got a small mango and coconut gelato to share with my sister, and the mango was super delicious! So I'd say I don't think I'd go there again, unless it's for the gelato."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Girls' night out was a success!

Price: Reasonable. 5.50 per burger + 3.50 to make it a combo with fries and a drink. Can't complain as you're in downtown Toronto.

Meal: Burgers were great! I had a spicy burger and my gf had the capitano burger, we both loved it, and we were both STUFFED! Onion rings were crunchy, the fries weren't the McD soggy types.

Service: We got ourselves two free samples of gelato for buying two burgers (courtesy of Yelp, thank you). I must say, the service was fantastic. The lady gave us so much gelato lol. Other places are so stingy even when you PAY for them. We tried the spicy chocolate and hazelnut and they were both a breeze, yummy yummy yum.

I would SOOO recommend this place to a friend, and for sure would go again the next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot!

I had the spicy burger and added cheese, and it was very juicy. It's probably the best burger I've had in the area, and there are quite a few choices nearby. The burgers are handmade with a good selection of toppings.

The gelato is made in-house and was very impressive. I had the salted caramel and the mojito, and they were both fantastic.

The service is very friendly and helpful, and the prices are very reasonable.

The restaurant itself is bigger than many along the lunch strip, so there is a decent amount of seating. It couldn't really handle a huge group though."}
{"text":"I came here on the recommendation of a foodie friend and was expecting some massively delicious burgers. What I got instead was a skinny, overcooked burger and some delicious gelato. Sigh. And I was the only one in the place when I got there, so.. it's not like they were too busy to make it good."}
{"text":"One of the best burger and gelato spots in Toronto! 
I really love its signature burgers, and its chicken burger is also impressing. Try the gelato there, it has at least 15 flavors for you to choose and every flavor is worth tasting. Overall, it is my favourite burger place in downtown."}
{"text":"The wild burger is amazing. It is literally one of the \"wildest\" burgers You will ever eat. Also the staff are very frienly and kind.
Their Pistachio flavored gelato is to die for.
Make sure you give them feedback because they seem eager to improve."}
{"text":"Hands-down this is a diamond in the rough! Great burgers, the poutine is awesome and you have to get the peanut butter and jelly gelato"}
{"text":"UPDATE UPDATE: Capitano (old and new) is closed.

UPDATE: The rumours are true. The ownership of my favourite no-brainer neighbourhood burger joint has changed.

The wonderful fried fish burger of O.G. Capitano (R.I.P.) has become an underwhelming, flat $7 grilled salmon patty that tastes cooked from frozen.

My beloved formerly $4.95 veggie is now $8 and no longer the juicy, flavourful bundle of joy that it once was. It has a few extra toppings added onto it, but asking for it plain will run you $7 anyway. Yet the classic burger is still $5. What?

Other cons:
- ...Besides the burgers not being nearly as good?
- No more complimentary mini gelato with your purchase
- Fewer fries on the side (it's +$5 to make your burger a combo)
- No more student discount that I could see
- No root beer

Some pros:
+ A DELICIOUS new avocado sauce/spread
+ Buns are still baked in-house and fluffy as hell
+ Meat is still antibiotic-free and responsibly sourced, according to the owner
+ They still accept/stamp the old loyalty cards, as one would hope
+ Gelato is fine, though a little mushier - lots of flavours including popcorn, rum raisin, Nutella, and coconut basil

The new owner seems like a super nice guy and is apparently planning to sell sandwiches, pizzas, etc. But I'd give anything (well, meaning my lunch hour forever business) to just get the titular burgers & gelato the way they were. *cue Barbra Streisand*"}
{"text":"Excellent service, very friendly 
Allowed me to have poutine as part of the combo. 

Had poutine, wild burger and the gelato burger. All were delicious, I will be back.

It's a nice break from the general crumminess of Yonge street, I really hope this place does well."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry to do this to you Capitano and while I love your food most of the time, there are some inconsistencies.  I still want to go here and will come back again soon, but I've probably been here close to 10 minutes and 7 times were phenomenal, 1 time was average, another was slightly below average and 1 was quite dismal.  The last time I came here, while they tried to accommodate me and fix the issue, the fries were hard and not salted enough and the burger tasted very bad.  This is rare and that's why I'm only docking one star, but for some reason, one of the fry cooks didn't add salt to the fries and they always have before.  The cashier said you could ask for salt, but what frustrated me is that they were always perfectly salted before and while I understand some people will say it's too salty, you can't go from quite salty to no salt at all. That's quite the change.  I have to say, all the bad times I was there, there was one consistency on who was making the food, but I don't want to say who, as they are making a living.  

While I love you Capitano, I really hope you can be more consistent.  However, gelato is still da bomb.  Love the mojito."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed by my burger here. The bun had a chewy crust that squashed all the toppings out the sides before my teeth could perforate it. I like most hamburgers but it was a disappointment here, especially since the buns are baked on site! I'll give them credit for having their hearts in the right place. 
That being said, their gelato is amazing. I had the dark chocolate, peanut butter and jelly and the pistachio but the choice was tough since every flavour I tried made me emit a sound of appreciation. 
Finally, don't let the abrasive characters out front hawking flyers put you off. I'm sure they mean well... Not the most appetising faces or personas, though."}
{"text":"I've been spying this place on my way to and from work for the last couple weeks. I decided I needed to try it. I had acquired a coupon for a free gelato sample from a man on the street so I started with that. I got bacon (yes, bacon gelato) and hazelnut. Both were good. I especially like the hazelnut. I don't think I'd get the bacon again as a matter of personal preference. 

After filling up on meat-ice cream I figured I'd have one of the veggie burgers. I got the mushroom melt one. It was easily the most delicious veggie burger I've ever had. The bun isn't oversized like other burger places. It is supposed to have \"aioli sauce\". Whatever pink goo they slapped on there was nothing like aioli but it was still tasty. As I hadn't had breakfast I figured I should test the sides, too. The poutine was my pick. Fries seemed to have been actual potatoes earlier that day. Very well prepared. The gravy was flavorful and salty. Cheese curds were ok but melted completely within seconds (I like 'em to retain their shape a bit). So the food was all delicious. The guy working cash gave me a discount for no real reason and offered a green bun for St Patrick's day (thanks for the offer but looks too moldy). I'm excited to go back and try the beef now. This place has real potential."}
{"text":"Went out for lunch with my coworkers and decided to try something new.  Big mistake.  

So I ordered a poutine thinking, you can't go wrong. And plus I was craving one for sometime.  Fries were undercooked, and the gravy had some chunks near the bottom that suggested it was a bottom of the barrel kinda deal.  

My coworkers both ordered classic burgers and said they were just fine, but also didn't really like the poutine either.  

So we all walked a few doors down back to work on our project and I immediately started feeling my stomach start to hurt. (Felt crappy till I got home)

At the end of the day we all agreed to NEVER eat there again."}

{"text":"We came here right after dumpling queen because our other friend joining us was all \"oh I had sushi for lunch no more Asian I hate life\" etc. 

I was super excited to see that you can sub fries for GELATO.

Colour me aroused, sexually.


So I got the spice burger which I thought was just kinda blah. They used hot peppers..since when does that gave any kick? Also, this may have been the messiest burger I have ever had. Dripping down my face dirty lol.

My friend had the fish which he really liked and the other guy had the master which he really liked too. The each got fries ans rings respectively.

The fries were yummy, standard fresh made fries fare..though they could've been cooked longer or soaked longer before cooking..

The onion rings were..inedible. come pletely soft and full of raw batter in like all of them.

I should be giving them two stars right?


But #DatGelato doe....omfg. after I was done my Burger I went back and got ma gelato. I asked nicely and they let me upsize to a medium for a dollar...Sweeeeeeet!

So. The gelato.

First off, they had an amazing selection of non diary options. 1 star. 

Then they told me I could mix three flavours
1 star.

I got the syraisbdlrhwhshrh ( I forgot the spelling clearly), the pb n j ans the pistachio.

All of them were awesome but the Pb & J really stood out and ... its dairy free and vegan? Ugh I just climaxed.


Will be back for gelato asap."}
{"text":"Burgers and gelato, what a delicious and deadly combination! I stumbled on this gem by accident while watching Cats at the Panasonic theatre. We were famished during intermission so we came here to grab a quick bite... and so glad we did! I got the spicy burger and it was so full of flavour. I didn't even have to ask for hot sauce to add more spice, which is very rare for me since I love heat. I've tried the peanut butter & jelly and mango gelato, both delicious. I especially liked the peanut butter & jelly one, I was told it was a house special and they mixed it themselves. 

The service is very friendly as well."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a bit dark, and the burger is a bit greasy for my taste. However, they gelato makes up for the main dish."}

Fair warning for take-out: It can get quite messy!"}

The bun is organic and perfectly baked. The fries were a little over done but I will be sure to mention it when I go for another visit. Did not try their gelato but it is made in house fresh every day and they do offer dairy-free choices which changes every day."}
{"text":"It's not bad. I'd give this place a 3.5.  It has room for improvement, but given the selection, prices and quality, I have returned several times.  Last time I was there I ordered the Capitano burger, it was delicious. So many fillings that i had to double check on their website... here you go... Grilled Beef Patty, Grilled Chicken Breast, Caramelized Peameal Bacon. Regular Beacon, Fried Egg, Swiss Cheese, Capitano Sauce... that was quite a mouthful... he actually warned me, thought i wouldn't finish it... can't wait to get it again."}

The Fries however hmmm I really hate to critic them for this but I feel the fries could be left a little longer in the fryer for a more crispy texture also they have started using some sort of seasoning on them which can be a little spicy. 

I understand why they do not overcook the fries but I would prefer mine crispy to soggy texture sorry!!

Apart from that the staff are really kind and friendly make you feel welcome and the whole vibe is cool down to the old tape deck behind the counter playing music."}
{"text":"The Master:  Super greasy goodness in every bite! Great burgers in downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic burgers and gelato. The Canadian banquet is probably my favorite, but the master comes close. There is no contest when it comes to burgers in this neighborhood. Capitano is king."}
{"text":"This place rocks!

Highlights:

-The buns. Oooooh the buns. Freshly baked goodness.
-The gelato: WOW! What a standout. I didn't come here looking to try the Gelato, but the owner gave me a free sample (he said he really wants to get the word out about their in-house made gelato), and wow, was I ever glad I tried it!  For me, the Gelato outshined the burger I had. I tried the salted caramel (heaven. mmmmmmm mmmm), and the Straciatella (also yummy.) Easily some of the best Gelato I have ever had the extreme pleasure of consuming. They also have a Yelp check-in offer to upsize your Gelato for free! Score!
-The service. SOOO super friendly and helpful.
-The awesome board you can draw on while waiting for your yummy food.
-The fact that you can call ahead for your order if you're in a rush

My chicken burger was flavourful and juicy, though a bit too greasy for my liking. Minus a few points for that.

All in all, I will definitely be back to try the beef burgers, as well some more of the deliciously amazing Gelato!"}
{"text":"Got the fish burger, fresh thick and juicy fish, fresh toppings and great sauce. 
I could have done with just the burger but I got the combo with fries and drink. 
I've had better fries but no complaints really.

Great quick service as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most under-rated burger place I have ever been to. Selfishly, I hope this place does not get incredibly popular like BP or HC so I can keep this hidden gem to myself!!

They offer home-made buns (which makes a HUGE difference in a burger) and home-made gelato which I didnt get the pleasure of trying, unfortunately.

ORDERED: 
- The Master ($8.50)
- Blue Lagoon ($7.95)
- Spicy Burger ($5.95)
- The Wild Burger ($8.95)
- Poutine ($5.50)

Originally we did not order The Wild BUT there was a mix-up and we got The Wild instead of The Master Upon realizing the mix-up, they prepared The Master free-of-charge on top of The Wild. Great customer service always adds to a meal!

VERDICT: Will most definitely be coming back. The freshly baked buns make a huge difference in a burger. The service was SUPER friendly and very accommodating. The burgers were generous and deliciously packed and very affordable. They are not skimpy with their ingredients!!

Notes: You can call ahead and order food if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after seeing the near perfect reviews it got on Yelp. Ordered the Master Burger and a poutine. The burger was really big, but nothing too special besides that. The poutine was pretty disappointing, the gravy was jelly-like and very chunky."}
{"text":"Fantastic little burger dive. The gelato menu is diverse and very well made.Love the burger buns that are made in-house and not the typical buns you find elsewhere. The burgers have been consistantly very good and I prefer them over W's. Onion rings are crisp and tastey. Check it out."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Although it's not the most comfortable fast food restaurant to sit in, the food is so good and the people are so nice, it doesn't matter how comfy my seats are! Maybe I was super hungry that day but I found the burger nice and juicy. A plus is that they sell gelato! Burgers and gelato.... How can you go wrong?!"}
{"text":"Update - tried the Raspberry Peach which was refreshing but not as strong as I'd have liked in flavour, and spicy chocolate which was REALLY interesting. Your experience will be as follows: bite...savour rich chocolately flavour for 3...2..1.... SPICE POW. Not overwhelming, but a definite chili thrill. Salted caramel still the favourte."}
{"text":"I really in all meanings of the word \"stumbled\" upon this place. I was picking something up for a coworker and was walking back to the office when I came upon this place. 

They were in the middle of a renovation and from what I understand this used to be a shawarma joint. But it looked like they were well on their way to get business through the door. I grabbed a veggie burger there and got a taste of their Gelato too (Spicy Chocolate is recommended for the adventurous). Top notch stuff here. Not the best burger I've had in my life but definitely up there. Staff was friendly and well knowledgeable. Its still in the middle of a reno but don't let your eyes deceive you and stop in for a bite."}
{"text":"Not only are the burgers and gelato here top-notch, the prices are fantastic. You get a 10% student discount if you have an ID, and on top of that they have a loyalty card for a free burger after 10 stamps. This is the only place in the city I know of where you can get a tasty burger, a drink, and a heaping cup of gelato (or fries/onion rings) for under $10. I usually add an extra patty to my burger, and I still end up paying less than $12 after tax for the super filling combo.

Although the burgers are fantastic, the gelato is probably the star of the show. Their lineup changes pretty much day to day, and I've seen such flavours as Kinder Bueno, Bailey's Irish Cream, donut (!), and mojito. Pretty sure they're all made in house, and they look as good as they taste.

The only thing is, as others have pointed out, the quality of the burgers is sometimes inconsistent, depending on who's cooking. The older gentleman appears to be the owner and makes the best burgers, and thankfully he's usually the one at the grill."}
{"text":"I don't understand. 
Why is it so difficult to find a good burger place?

I got the portobello burger with onion rings. With tax it's $17.
At this price, I'm expecting an amazing burger. Better than big smokes, five guys, burger's priest. It was a big disappointment. The patty was dry, bland, overcooked, there was no special sauce. 

I would go for a McD and get a big mac combo x2."}
{"text":"They have been bought out by a group of people that want to integrate Latin food into the menu. I stopped by for gelato, and was happy with the flavors and portion size. I am curious to see what they do with the place. The name will change, but they will keep the burgers and gelato."}
{"text":"I live on Yonge so I'm always aware when something new opens.  A lot of the new food spots that have opened up on Yonge bore me, but this place and TKRE across the street are both excellent choices that have opened up in 2013.

I got the ringer with fries to go and it was solid.  Smelled great on the way home and it did not disappoint.  The Capitano sauce is a little too tangy for my preferences but it still tasted good. The fries were kind of saugy by the time I got home but they are marinated in some herbs after they come out and taste different from any other burger spot you know.  Overall experience was a solid A.  

I also sampled the Hazelnut & Pina colada gelato while I was waiting for my order  and they were both also excellent."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and it didn't disappoint! The small sized gelato (3.95) is so refreshing and delicious, a very generous portion as well."}
{"text":"Haven't had the burgers but the gelato was great! The staff was super helpful and even deterred me from getting two flavors that wouldn't blend well. Went with the strawberry and peanut butter combo instead and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I went here the other day for lunch.  I'm not really into ice cream so I passed on the gelato.

Burger was OK...not sure if there were any condiments on it but what I do remember was that it was greassssy.   Not saying that's bad.  Just what it was.  I like the buns they use.  

All the guys working were nice.  I had a Canadian burger.  Nice big pieces of bacon.  I'd like to go again.  I wasn't blown away...but still had a positive experience."}
{"text":"Reading all the rave reviews I will definitely give this place a second chance and update my review. Admittedly I wasn't adventurous in my gelato choice...also I missed the fact that they had burgers (but I was stuffed from Hair of the Dog!). I remember the gelato being good but I wasn't blown away like other reviewers. I do remember friendly service and ample seating space :)"}
{"text":"This place have new owners, they improved and added a lot of stuff to the menu. The staff is really nice. I particularly recommend this place 100%"}
{"text":"Burgers and Gelato all in one place! What more could you ask for?!

I ordered the fish burger while my companion got the Canadian. I thoroughly enjoyed mine - fish was juicy. But those buns... buns were amazing. They were soft and fresh and held the burger in place nicely without falling apart like other places. 

The Gelato was so good. They let you pick that up after you finish your meal so its not a melted mess. I got hazelnut and pistachio and it they were both delicious. It's a good value meal for the combo, very filling. I wish I knew about the yelp check in before. This just means I have to make another visit. Definitely worth it. Staff is super friendly too which is always nice!"}
{"text":"1) The buns are baked on the spot. They are fresh and delicious
2) They get their organic meet from a local butcher 
3)  The burgers are only $6 and they are really filling!
4) They have vegetarian options
5) At the same place they sell DELICIOUS HOME MADE GELATO! I mean it when i say, this is some of the best ice cream I have had in my life!!
6) The owners are super chill. Recent university graduates who are passionate about good food!

Bottom line: Some of the best burgers in Toronto accompanied with some of the best ice cream in the world. What more could you want!?"}
{"text":"I had the Wild Burger which was AMAZINGLY TASTY! Sauteed mushrooms, red peppers and goat cheese made it a decadent filler that was surprisingly more hefty than I thought. Boyfriend and I had a night on the town and we were full for the entirety (walking from Yonge Street to past Christie Pits) and we were still full  He had a banquet burger and left satisfied. Onion rings (which I found a bit salty but still good) For $14.10, not bad! I have to come back...if you check in with Yelp, you get a free sample gelato :)"}
{"text":"The burger was very good, the gelato was very good also, I haven't tried many, just 5 or 6 flavours. The chocolate was great, I didn't like the strawberry sorbet. Not the best burger I've had, but I like to have a fresh bun burger with portobello and roasted red peppers in close proximity, sometimes I crave something exactly like that!"}
{"text":"This has got to be my favourite hangout spot ever (in the summer).

Burger and fries combo. OR burger and gelato combo.

They have great gelato here, I love the roasted almond. The burgers are just okay. Extremely messy though! 

The poutine was pretty bad.

The service is amazing!!! I think they recognize me now, which is fun. I bring friends on dates here because it's really quiet -we're usually the last group to leave. The staff does not mind that sat here forever."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago to try one if their burgers and gelato samples. The experience left a bad taste in my mouth (quite possibly literally), as the whole dining room had to be subjected to a loud argument that was held between the chef and the person running the cash/gelato bar. The topic of the argument was regarding a sanitation issue, which is probably the last thing that you'd want to hear about from the people who just made your food. Hence, I will not be eating here again, even though the cashier did apologize to everyone afterwards...

Despite the disturbing incident, the Master Burger I had here was average at best. It looked sizable and well made, but tasted mostly dry and the patty was nothing special. I sampled the Bailey's gelato and it was quite tasty-made with real Bailey's I believe. 

Overall, this place is probably overhyped as there are better burger joints in this city. The final review rating is undeniable 1 star based on my whole experience."}
