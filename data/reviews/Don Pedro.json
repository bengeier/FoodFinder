{"text":"Wonderful food, large portions, quick and excellent service. The deluxe burrito is amazing, and don't forget to try their guacamole as an appetizer !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Gastonia and there are many places to eat. Don Pedro has great food, dishes are fresh, hot and bountiful. Love trying different items. You can ask for anything and they will make it for you. The place is beautiful, servers are great. Fun for family, couples and large groups. We go often."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very generous servings. Attentive wait staff. Clean, cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went there for Sunday lunch with a couple of friends and had an amazing time! Service was very attentive! Best Mexican restaurant in Gastonia - definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last week for lunch. I found a good Groupon deal, which prompted the visit. 
The decor and ambiance is great, and the place is much bigger than it looks from the outside. 

The chips and salsa to start our lunch were excellent. I told our server that I like very spicy sauce.  He brought out three different salsas to choose from. Now that's what I call service. 

I ordered the fajitas which came out sizzling hot in a short amount of time. It was delicious!  I ordered the churro dessert plate, which also came out hot, with ice cream and whipped cream on the side.  Again...excellent!!  

I will be dining at Don Pedro's again. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Anna was very polite! You can't miss her, she's the one with the pretty smile. Ask for her! The Don Jain is the best on the menu!"}
{"text":"Food is very fresh and tasty and, unlike other restaurants we've tried, there's no adobo / msg / additive garbage :)!  Restaurant decor is tastefully authentic, and the service is attentive, without being annoyingly so.  Great place...one of our favorite's in the area."}
{"text":"This place has great food! I recently moved here from Los Angeles and know good Mexican food, this place reminds me of the food back home!"}
{"text":"From the Bountyfull order of chips and salsa to the strawberry/whip cream covered chip at the end, ALL WAS GREAT!!!
I can't belive that we have been having lunches here from DAY 1, and I never reviewed them. But, this is only my 4th review of any place.
My WIFE and I have enjoyed everthing we ordered here. She Loves the Chicken Chims."}
{"text":"Don Pedro in Gastonia. Good food, good service, and very nice ambience. Love their Chimichangas, queso, and sopapillas."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some Mexican food with my sweetie.  Unfortunately the place we were going to was shut down permanently.  Thanks to google, we perused our options and stumbled upon Don Pedros.  It didn't look like much from the outside, but hot damn! The interior was fabulous!  The carved booths made us feel like a king and queen.  Our server number 7 was awesome and gracious and fixed us some amazing Margaritas.  The food was fantastic!  The portions generous, the flavor amazing! just a terrific experience!  Thank you DON PEDRO!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was not good.  Service was good. Not impressed. Tequilas on Hudson much better food"}
{"text":"I used my \"Accidental Groupon\" here thinking it was the Don Pedros I usually frequent in Pineville. Let's just say not all Don Pedros are created the same. The decorum was the same however.  Traditional Mexican fiesta feel. The service was great; very friendly and helpful waiter and host. This they have down pat. However the food lacked the rich flavor I love at the Pineville locale. From the salsa to the tacos and refried beans, I was looking for the salt shaker. Woefully disappointed."}
{"text":"So gloomy. Servers attitude is worse than a used mop. Including manager. Didn't feel satisfaction eating here at all. The young lady that serves chips walks with no motivation & acts like if she doesn't want to be here at all. I will not be stepping another foot here ever again."}
{"text":"The nachos were massive.  I mean I ate them as my meal, warmed them up (in the oven! Don't microwave nachos! ) for my boyfriend for lunch the next day, and then he gave away what he couldn't finish.  They were good. Almost all nachos are good. I added chicken and it wasn't very flavorful."}
{"text":"There lunch specials are good deal-but don't try and use a groupon for it, only regular priced items are available for their groupon they have out. I will give the place one more try before I update this review"}
{"text":"Great food! Wish the people were nicer. Everyone has bad days though! 

The free fried desert they give you at the end is mainly why this review is 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Not a fan.  We were very excited to go here after hearing many positive things.  The staff was not the friendliest, the food was not the best and we were just generally displeased."}
{"text":"Great Mexican chicken soup. Ask for limes to squeeze into it fir even more authentic flavor."}
{"text":"I have been to 3 different Don Pedros, but this location is my favorite. Anyone that is not a fan of the restaurant needs to stick with the specialties as they are flavorful and always delicious. My fave is fajitas funditas which is fajitas smothered in cheese! It is not on the menu, but if you ask for it... they automatically know you are a DP Pro. 

I have not found another Mexican Restaurant that is as good as Don Pedros."}
{"text":"After a gender reveal party in Gastonia we decided we needed more food than just cake and ice cream .

Someone suggested Don Pedro.  It is in a small shopping center that I would have never noticed. 

We had 12 people and only had to wait about 15 minutes.  After we were seated it took a while to get our drinks, but other than that the service was really good.  

I got the arroz pollo.  Let me tell you that the portion was huge and the flavors were amazing!  I could only eat half of it and I ordered it without the tortillas.

My husband got the number 20 and devoured the whole plate.

The waiter brought out dessert for free which was an added bonus!"}
{"text":"The real deal  authentic Mexican food. Cooked fresh  lots of selections. Big portions. Decor is boring but the food and staff are good. They have all the usual items and combos. You'll be sure to find something for everyone    in strip mall south of gastonia"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Don Pedro's I leave happy and full. Best Chimichanga on the planet. Fajitas are great as well. Love that we can bring large parties here as well. Friendly staff. Super food. Laid back atmosphere. What a meal is all about."}
{"text":"Don Pedros has amazing food! The service was excellent. Our server was very nice and attentive and the portions of the food were huge. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great food! Good prices and good service! The vegetarian burrito was awesome. The ladies that work here are super sweet. Been several times and every time we have been they have been great!"}
{"text":"First time. The restaurant is beautiful and all the staff extremely nice. The food was delicious and mmmm the margaritas were very refreshing.  First time but not my last. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The employees here are prompt and friendly. My food has been great everytime I've visited and generous sized portions.
They also offer a vegetarian menu which is a big plus for me and give you this yummy (free) dessert chips afterwords.
They have a pretty good deal with the lunch specials too."}
