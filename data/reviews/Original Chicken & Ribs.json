{"text":"I stopped here one night after driving by it a million times. I'm glad I did. The burger was hand patted, cooked to order and seasoned well. The fries were good too. You need to check it out! You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"My husband and I were happy to find a local place for pick-up. Great for those days when you forget to defrost something or don't feel like cooking. The entrance to the parking lot is from Oaklawn Avenue. The interior is small, so calling in your order may be preferable.   Our consistent favorites are the flounder or perch fish sandwich platters - they come with fries and a small drink. I love the homemade tartar sauce. The fries remind me of school cafeteria fries, but for some reason they always seem especially delicious, with a perfect crispy outer layer and tender inside.   We've tried the ribs, and they were good. Ditto for their hush puppies and cole slaw. We look forward to working our way through the rest of the menu. Give the place a try! Buy local!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place one day this week for lunch around 1:30. I ordered the 4 wings & fries, also a side of banana pudding. The wings were seasoned to perfection and the fries were the good crinkle cut kind. The wings were tiny & the banana pudding wasn't homemade. I will have to go again to order something else. Based on the several people in and out of the restaurant within 15 minutes, this place has something good to offer!"}
{"text":"Drive by one day on the way to a work meeting. Decided to stop back by afterwards for lunch. The outside makes the look bigger than it is inside for customers. The address is Beatties Does but the entrance is onk u accessible via Oaklawn.   They have all menu items on electronic food board as well as paper menus that you can take.  This place is take out only location.   It is best to call ahead of you know what you want and then come in.  As far as my experience, the cashier was friendly and explained items clearly. I ended up getting the Super \"T\" plattter which was a bacon cheese burger all the way (lettuce, tomato, mayo and pickle) fries and a drink. I did receive to special gifts with my platter, a cheese stick and onion rings. Both the then were delicious and are in my list for next time.  The food was great. And I can't wait to go back. Next time I'll try the chicken or ribs."}
{"text":"Called in order was told that it would take 20 minutes when I got there they haven't even started on it when I got the food it wasn't even the right order so I had to wait another 20 minutes for my food they never answer their phone no matter if you call night or day I would not recommend this place if you're going there for lunch as a call in you will still have to wait the old Chicken and Rib was better than this new one and the cashiers at times up there act like they doing you a favor rude the prices have went up and their food is gotten smaller in size"}
{"text":"My family and I love their fried chicken (fried hard) and mac n cheese. I always order the 8 piece mixed chicken with the mac n cheese. FYI. if you call and the phone line is busy, that means they are busy and you will need to come in person to place your order."}
{"text":"I order lunch over the phone. With a man who seem to have great customer service.  He told me 15-20 min. .. for a hotdog special . When I arrived 16 min later. No where to park. Got parked went inside. The older rude lady said my food wasn't ready. I waited inside for 5 more mins. Then went in outside to give other space that were coming in. Went back in 5 mins later. Thinking my food be Rady and cold by now. The older rude lady ask what did I have.  Told her, then she said it's been ready! What!!!! Really maybe if I would have been rude like her I would got my food 5 mins ealier...  Well I'm over it. Food was good. But better customer service needed"}
{"text":"Just like home. Give you that good homegrown feel. Small Togo place in the hood but that home feeling customer service. No place you can sit down but the food is worth it. It's in the hood but don't let that stop you from getting this good food. I think that makes it even better!"}
{"text":"Just now ordered ther 4pc BBQ chicken dinner, w/ mac and cheese, potato salad. I am looking forward to eating this meal. But, unfortunately I still can't say anything positive about the experience or customer service at this location.   For as much business as they seem to consistently get, the customer service upon entering and placing orders could be way better. Everything from the frustration expressed by the woman behind the counter (older, dyed blond hair) after i placed a simple order, to her putting way too much ice in each and every cup for drink orders, to the ridiculous, unexplained wait times...... this place just is not cutting it for me. Good food, but the experience leaves a bad taste in my mouth"}
{"text":"My wife and I usually enjoy this small fast food place. The food is ok and prices are good. But I have to say they have one lady that works up front and she has a very bad habit of answering the phone, than putting me on hold and then hanging up on me after making me wait for 10+ min. This is completely unacceptable behavior. I really do wish this area wasn't such a food desert, and I had other options of getting my fast food somewhere else when we don't feel like cooking diner."}
{"text":"Insanely delicious southern cooked food. Yes the place is in the hood but you gonna want more of this good flavor or here. Lots of varieties to choose from. Cakes and cobblers too. Greens and okra too. Follow me I'll show you how to ge there. Get me a wing dinner plate too. Lol"}
{"text":"I have been here twice this week. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. My office decided to order out for lunch and we left two orders behind. They called our office to tell us we left the food and one of the employees brought it to the office. I am very pleased and appreciative; I will be back."}
{"text":"When I tell you I hate when you are a faithful customer and the food was always just right.. But today I don't know what it is but they messed up everything...  Make it so bad I had someone with me who I was bragging about how good they were and her food was awful.. You think you asked for a chicken Filet sandwich it would be big it looked like a chicken strip but on a big bun.  I got the greens it taste like somebody just poured sugar on top of them.  Bad enough you have to deal with the lil rude lady who is always mean you get nasty food.  I spent my whole lunch break plus some more just trying to get my food right.. Like I told them I could tell it was a new cook back there because the food has never been this nasty.. Plus I drive over 20 minutes just get the food.  Hell I should have just went to McDonalds....Shame on you chicken and ribs shame on you."}
{"text":"I had it a few weeks ago while taking care of some business. I had the fried chicken and beef ribs. Excellent!!! For dessert I had the peach cobbler,excellent. It's a good thing that I'll be taking care of some more business in the area in a few weeks."}
