{"text":"Not sure if it's fair to judge a place with only one visit and one dish but I think I'll go with my instincts and do just that. After all, not so many people give a second chance to a place that they got disappointed at their first try. 

I tried their (forgot the name) noodles with chicken and broccoli dish after asking for an authentic Cambodian dish. It was my very time trying Cambodian. They had 3 choices to choose from in this category as the others were just a spin-off standardized Asian dishes. 

The place itself is simple, clean but the plate I ordered remains to be desired. Somehow the noodles and company were literally swimming in the sauce and so overfilled that the sauce was very eager to jump out and meet the tray every time I dug my fork in. I had to take it back to the counter and transfer the whole thing into a deep styrofoam take out box. The noodles were a challenge to get hold of bcs they used large flat ones and the sauce seemed liked it was mixed with edible WD40. To finish the dish was a real struggle with plastic utensils. Also, the overall taste wasn't special. 

I'd recommend to go to Thai Express, for a mere $1 extra, you get a better quick grub general experience plus much better quality. I don't think I'll be back here. It's a two star and a meh."}

{"text":"Really good food for a quick cheap lunch eapecialy! Their spring rolls are incredible!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, I'll definitely be back! Authentic Cambodian cuisine. Went with the Num Bahn Chok salad and it's delicious and fresh. High-value, low cost. A real deal.

I really liked the bowl's presentation and appreciated our host's recommendation. Lots of options (some made in-house!) to spice up the flavor. Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Cambodian food. This simple little restaurant was a pleasant discovery in the St Rose area of Laval. I've come here on multiple occasions now and everything I've ordered is nothing short of delicious! Family owned and operated.  Their noodle and rice dishes are flavourful, vibrant with flavours and sauce. 

My go to dish here is he salad num banh chok. The best way I can describe it is like a fresh Vietnamese Vermicelli salad bowl with beef and spring roll. For Vietnamese it's similar to a bun thit nuong. Or a bun cha gio. Although compare to other versions I've tried I'd say it's even fresher and bigger! On multiple occasions I've sampled it I've left very content! 

I've also tried their beef katang. Beef in a rich gravy sauce over rice noodles. A great rich gravy sauce. 

Their fried rice is light, well balanced in flavour and little bits of veggies and mine was ordered with chicken! 

The restaurant is very simple, don't come expecting much. You order your food cafeteria style in advance and they bring it out after. It's also cash or interact. No CC accepted. Prices are super inexpensive and servings are generous! 

No alcohol served here and dishes run around $10 a dish. Takeout is available and they wrap it up well in a plastic bag. 

They also promote their business on Facebook and Instagram so check them out! 

I'll definitely be back as it's that good!"}
{"text":"Nice local place. I discover it by accident. Very welcoming owner. He explained every dish. Pretty good portions at a reasonable price. It seems everything is prepared by family member. The pad Thai was way better than the one i usually get from Thai express. Its was spicier than what i expected but full of flavour. The spring rolls crispy and tasty . Chicken wings seasoned and spiced to perfection. Really liked it . Would go back definitely."}
