{"text":"Ordered two pizzas for take-out, \"wanna ti amo\" and '\"wanna bella\".  Amazing Pizza! Not your typical take-out pizza, so much better!!! .   Was really impressed and will definitely return."}

{"text":"A new pizza place by work. They've just opened so the decor still needs to be worked on. I had their deluxe pizza. Thin crust and crunchy - it was delicious. A slice is about four dollars.  Can't wait to try their other pizzas."}
