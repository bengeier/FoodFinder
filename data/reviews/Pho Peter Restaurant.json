{"text":"Disgusting restaurant. Ordered the wonton soup and found a larva in it!!! 
Never going back there again and I don't recommend anyone to this place."}
{"text":"The food was decent but I felt like I was at home.  It was nothing special. My boyfriend said the soup broth for my won ton soup tasted like instant noodle broth...which is  good thing if you like that flavour.  The wontons were miniscule and not loaded with meat.  There was no shrimp in the wontons like the menu claimed.  I would eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good, fast and inexpensive food.  Yes, it's a bit of a dive but you don't come here to eat for the ambiance.  The veggie dishes are a hefty portion and always come out hot.

Most definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pho broth in town and the prices are incredible. Service isn't great, but it also isn't the worst. I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm pretty much a regular here for years. It's a family operated restaurant. Their pho taste really good, ask them to make your pho spicy, they'll put in sate paste and it makes your pho taste even better.  Their chicken curry , lemon grass chicken, pork chop, Vietnamese fried rice, spring roll, and salad roll taste really good as well. 

I usually go here when I don't feel like making dinner and want to eat something quick. Their service is quite fast. Restaurant atmosphere is nothing to brag about. Their food price is actually quite cheap."}
{"text":"Love the food here! I'm a big fan of their curry chicken, pad Thai and fried rice... The best part is that prices are really good. Most items are $7-$12."}
{"text":"Disappointed  in the broth and meatballs. Tried it due to numerous recommendations from long time Brampton residents. Pho Dau Bo is much better."}
{"text":"I discovered Vietnamese food by accident a couple of years ago. I love it! And Pho Peter makes some of the best in the Brampton area. 

Try the Vietnamese Spring Rolls and fried rice. Sooooo good! 
Also, the Chicken Noodle and Rare Beef Noodle Soups are amazing.

Prices are decent, and you get lots for cheap! Service is very quick...no waiting, One of my favorite places to go for a quick bite to eat when I'm out and about."}
{"text":"One of the best family run pho places. 

I've been coming here since 2000 (so 17 years) and it's been the same owners since. We've seen their family grow and it's quite amazing. 

All their dishes are amazing quality and taste and their prices are very cheap. 

It's always a nostalgic feeling coming here!"}
{"text":"Having grown up in Markham and Scarborough, I know a thing or two about decent pho.  This pricing of this place is cheap to eat but so is the quality of the food.  The broth had little taste and there isn't much meat in even the large size.  I can't really understand how this could be considered among the best pho in Brampton unless the other reviewers haven't try much pho elsewhere.    

PS - The bathrooms are gross like a restaurant out of China town, I would try to hold out on tinkering until you go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and was not thoroughly impressed. I had the vermicelli with grilled pork and spring roll. Sadly, this was an extremely disappointing choice. Meat was tough and some pieces were dried out almost jerky like. The noodles were fine but missed accompaniments like basil and or mint that would have elevated the dish. The saving grace was the spring roll, it was very good, but not enough to make me come back. Service was friendly but extremely slow, but to be fair, there was only one person serving and possibly doing the cooking.  I think I need to stop ordering vermicelli because I've been disappointed when I do :("}
{"text":"My go to place for  a special spicy Fried Rice. I can't say anything about other food in the menu since I haven't tried them but their Fried Rice is certainly one the best in the GTA. My favorite is the chicken and pork (quite generous with the meat)."}
{"text":"I really like the food at Pho Peter. I usually get the lemongrass chicken and some vegetarian rice paper rolls. Really flavourful and fresh, and when I ask for spicy they make it spicy. Always a big plus!  

My husband usually gets one of the specials that comes with a meatball and some mince (shrimp?) on a piece of sugar cane. Sadly, I do not remember the exact menu number, but it has a tasty variety of meat and plenty of noodles. 

Anyway, their food's great, but the reason this gets three instead of four stars is that the service ranges from acceptable to dismal, from reasonably friendly-but-slow, to downright surly. 

Its proximity to home, good prices, and comfy (if kitschy and outdated) interior make it a regular spot, but I definitely do NOT go there for the service."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today and maybe my review might be a bit biased as I've been going to this place since my teen years or maybe even pre-teen years.

If you just want to get full and eat good food for a good price, Pho Peter is the place to go.  Their rice and fried noodle dishes are very large portions so it's great if you like to eat family style to share.  The pho bowls are more individually sized but still tastes great!  As well as any soup dish or rice and meat dishes are good for individual sizes, but I always need a takeout container at the end of my meal.

You cannot go to this restaurant for eye candy and as we know, the decor needs to be upgraded which is why I had to give 4 stars.

The customer service is pleasant, they know me by now and it's always great seeing them whenever we go in. 

I hope this place stays open for awhile as it's our go to spot whenever we're hungry and need something fast and cheap.  Just a heads up, sometimes their debit machine doesn't work so it's good to bring cash.  I can't recall if they take all major credit cards, sorry!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their hue special noodle soup! It's the best one I've tried and I've gone to a lot of Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"This is a great Pho restaurant with a large menu. The service is quick and the decor is as quaint as all of my favourite pho restaurants."}
{"text":"I ordered congee, it was bit on the salty side. But it was still yummy. My husband had a pho and he said it was okay.

Service: no ac, all the guests were sweating as they ate. Get an ac!

Only one waitress, get more help!

The interior design was awful. Need a major renovation."}
{"text":"First off, the most amazing Fresh Vietnamese Spring rolls ever! I've tried them all over the GTA area and nowhere else compares. And my second favourite thing to order is the \"Bun Bo Hue\" its a spicy noodle soup. It comes with a different noodle than the regular pho noodles and it's also the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Ah I've been going to Pho Peter for about 10 years. I love this little place.

Atmosphere: nothing special. They did upgrade the tables and chairs a few years ago to something you would see in an older dining room. You definitely aren't going to sit there for hours and hours.

Food: I love the food and it's always fresh and cooked the way I ask. I usually get the shredded pork vermacelli. I think it's #37. I ask for the pork to be well-done and salad on the side. 

Lately I've also been getting this dish that's udon noodles, in a coconut sauce with shredded pork or somethign on top. I don't know what it is but I love it.  Their Pho is great too. I especially love the fresh and fried rolls. 

Service: It's a family owned place, husband and wife.  When I first started going there, their son was just a wee thing. I don't see him around anymore cause he's all grown up.  They recognize me when I go in and comment when I haven't been in awhile.  You serve yourself if you want beer, from the fridge, they don't mind. It's a VERY casual place and the service is very speedy. You won't be waiting for your food very long. 

I will always go here for my fav Viet dishes. It's cheap, fast and consistent.  Go!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Service was terrible, cleanliness was despicable and the food was mediocre(and that's me being nice)...drive over to Saigon house if you want better of all of the above"}
{"text":"Love this place!
I've been to many pho restaurants - in north york, scarborough, vaughn and this is hands down the best pho I've had. The prices are very reasonable as well.
It's a small restaurant, nice for a lunch date. 
I always get the well done beef noodle soup and vegetable spring rolls. I've been going here for many years and it never disappoints. I live in toronto now, and when I am in the Brampton area, it is my #1 fav spot to eat!"}
{"text":"If staying power counts for anything Pho Peter has been around forever. The place is in a bit of a divey plaza and the restaurant itself isn't much to look at but the food is good and authentic. Other places have come and gone and some trendy chains have come along too. And then there's good 'ol Pho Peter."}
{"text":"FINALLY tried this place after years of driving by it.  Been on a bit of a Pho kick lately, trying all the major places here in Brampton (Pho Mi 99, Pho Dau Bo, Saigon House, and now Pho Peter) and Pho Peter is definitely quite good.

Their spring rolls are insanely delicious, and PACKED with filling.  I have never seen such large spring rolls at any of the Pho restaurants I've been to, and they definitely deserve an honorable mention.

The pho is tasty, meat looked of good quality, but had to take a star away because the broth is quite cloudy.  I am not a pho expert by any means, but most people say the best pho broths should be clear, which is a good indicator of a slow simmered stock that takes quite a bit of time.  Pho Peters was already a dark brown color when it arrived.

However it tasted great, and again, love those spring rolls.

We will definitely return."}
{"text":"My family and friends used to go here a lot... a lot. Like if we wanted pho, no discussion, this is where we went. 

I used to love their pad Thai, spring rolls, and everything else. We would even order catered dishes from them. They were just the best. 

We stopped going for sanitary reasons. My dad went to the washroom one time and came back looking like he says about to puke. He said he saw a glimpse of the kitchen and there were flies everywhere, landing on everything. 

It takes a lot for my dad to get grossed out over food prep sanitation. For him to say no to this place, it must have been that bad. I'm not going to describe what he told us as it's really disgusting and the thought of it alone now is grossing me out. 

We got up from our table and never came back. This was a few years ago and to this day, we won't step foot in that place. It's kind of sad, because they make the best spring rolls in my opinion, and I miss it. Unfortunately, I can't get the image out of my head the way my dad described it. 

Maybe it was just that one day that it was really bad, but it was enough to turn is off completely."}
{"text":"Good food! Fast service! 

Odd diningroom but if you can look past it (and you should) it is a great place for Vietnamese food! 

Always a Hit!"}
{"text":"Great local restaurant serves great food with larger servings for good prices.  Yes the decor is a bit crazy.....  But then again we aren't talking about a five star dining experience here.....  But the BBQ pork soup is amazing!!!!  Good Pho for a decent price that's the draw of Pho Peter."}
{"text":"Been going to Pho Peter for over 10 years and it's soup and fresh rolls are the best in town. The interior does need an update but don't judge it by that. The food is fresh, hot and favourable. It's like a 2nd home away from home. You be the judge of it."}
{"text":"Service: 7/10
Pork Spring rolls: 6/10
Rare Beef Satay Noodle Soup: 6/10

My experience here was pleasant. I came in with an open mind as I always do at new pho spots that I have tried in and around the GTA. Our waitress brought out our soups without basil, sprouts, and lime, which I found quite disappointing. I didn't Polish my blend because I was suffering from a mind blowing tumour of a hangover but this place was alright! I recommend it if you are passing by the area and are craving a spicy blend!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and quick service. I ordered the satay (spicy) rare beef pho which was classic, the broth was incredible. The hot tea to start was also nice. 

The down side was the pork spring rolls.. they weren't the best, a little big and overwhelming. 

The server forgot to bring out the basil leaves, sprouts, like and hot chilies.

All in all the pho was good but the service was average and the spring rolls sucked. 

I would return!"}
{"text":"I like going to this place but it is easy to be turned off if it is your first time here. The interior could really use an update. It is run by a family and they are always good with service even though their English is not great.

There are other Vietnamese places in Brampton but this one gives big portions and the food is tasty from the things I usually order. The fried pork rolls are great for appetizers and so is the shrimp and bbq pork fried rice.

They only take cash or debit."}
{"text":"This place was mediocre.  I followed the advice of past yelpers and tried the phad thai,  #168 I think.  I totally disagree.  It was greasy and tasteless.  Really not good.  My friend had the pho soup and it seemed pretty good.  The fried spring roll was alright but the dough was thick and greasy too."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service

Decided to try this place out after seeing some positive reviews as I was visiting Brampton recently.

Pho Peter is located in a rather sketchy plaza across from a high school, so I can imagine this place gets busy during lunchtime. I came just after the lunch rush where there was only 2 tables occupied. There's not much in terms of decorations, and the lighting is a bit dimmer than usual. But hey, in these establishments you come for the food, not the ambience and decorations!

I ordered a small banh canh cua, which has become my standard for authentic Vietnamese places that serve this item. Similar to other Vietnamese places, I rarely order pho unless there's no other options as it's something that's hard to screw up and I rather try the more exotic items. Anyway, their speed is quite good and I had my food within 5 minutes.

The crab broth was a bit oily, but I definitely didn't feel any MSG-like taste, so I guess the water content was a bit low. Either way the noodle was done quite well, slightly chewy but not to the point where it's overcooked (banh canh is easy to overcook).

Price point was excellent, less than $10 for my food. Service was also very good, although it took a little bit of time to get a server since she was in the kitchen when I arrived.

Just don't go to the washroom, but then again Vietnamese places aren't known for sanitary washrooms."}
{"text":"I have gone here at least once a week for the last few months since relocating to brampton. I loved it until the past month. I only eat fish so I assumed I was safe with ordering from the vegetarian section of the menu. About three weeks ago I found a chunk of pork in my veggie curry (first strike), thought it might of been a fluke or fallen in. Next time i went I asked the server (the son) if there was any meat or meat broth in the veggie curry, he said no, just veggies. That time I didn't find any meat. I went last week and again found meat in the veggie curry, this time I told the wife/owner and let her know I get very sick when ingesting meat products, she checked with the cook and apparently the cook accidentally used meat curry? No discount given (second strike). Last night my mom wanted to go there so I went reluctantly and ordered the veggie pho. Once again I found a piece of meat floating in my VEGETARIAN pho. STRIKE THREE!
Honestly, how hard is it to be honest, if I ask whats in your broth just say its not vegetarian, I would of ordered cold rolls or something. It's too bad, I thought the owners were sweet. If you lie about what's in your food, it doesn't make it vegetarian."}
{"text":"Brampton doesn't have many good food options but I'd have to argue that this is probably one of the best ones. Place doesn't look it from the outside or inside but the food is absolutely amazing, I go here regularly. I always get the crispy noodles with seafood and make it spicy, it's so good and my fav dish. The fried rice here is really good too and has great flavour. The place has the best crispy noodles for sure, I've tried many others but their broth the soak the noodles in here is second to none. The spring rolls I get often are giant and are delicious as well. Cool cozy environment. Great service and the portions of the food is really good for what you pay it's a steal. Highly recommend as I'm a regular customer ever since I found this mom and pop type of restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends a couple of weekend ago. It is a cozy restaurant, i believe it's family ran. The service was bit slow, but good nonetheless. 
We each got our individual pho, and a couple dishes to share. Really good portions. I got the Shrimp Pad Thai. I was full and had enough left over to pack for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"So 4 stars means that I am a fan and yes that is true, I don't normally come here for pho because I have my other pho place that i normally go to. I come here for their seafood on crispy fried noodles. My friend calls it a 'Nest' because you have a big chunk of fried noodles (that looks like a nest) with seafood and vegetables flowing down from the top. Very crunchy and delicious. I know i can't just give a review on one item so I will continue to talk about service. The people there are friendly and the place looks clean. I dont know how service is during peak times but for me it was fine. the only thing that I don't like is at times their debit/visa machine is not working and you would have to pay by cash (i wish they would inform you in advance). they would direct you to an atm machine in a laundry establishment next to their place. I would come back but mostly for that fried noodles."}
{"text":"I grew up in Brampton and moved to BC within the last 5/6 years. Every time I come to visit my folks, I always aske to eat at Pho Peter. (My old high school was right across the street too) I know it's a dingy place and can be considered the new \"ghettos\" in Brampton but you go to Pho Peter for the food, not their location or ambiance!
Our family favourites are #168 & #163, which is the spicy chicken pad thai and (spicy chicken) fried rice. They also have them in beef and pork. Of all the asian restaurants I've been in Toronto and BC, there is no place that have these dishes anywhere! It must be a family recipe. Their veggie spring rolls are one of the best I've ever had too! These are the dishes I would definitely recommend, especially if you love spicy food. NOTHING COMPARES! 
I've recommended families and friends to Pho Peter, and obviously they automatically judge their simple appearance but once they try the food, they've also fallen in love! 
I hope and pray the restaurant owners stay so whenever I come back, I'll be coming back for Pho Peter!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for more than 8 years & it's still our favourite pho place. The restaurant itself is very outdated. Christmas decorations all year round but the service is great! Peter and his family are very nice. We've tried different places in Brampton and we always come back to Pho Peter. Love the spring rolls and #14. The prices are great and you get so much food! Love them."}
{"text":"This is the best pho you can get in the GTA. I have been going here for over 10 years. Not a chain, so the food is always amazing and has a home style quality. The portions are HUGE, and so delicious. This menu is also large with tons of options like noodles and curries as well as tons of soup options. I personally love the fresh and regular spring rolls, the pad thai with chicken and shrimp, and the Wonton soup with egg noodle. You will not be disappointed with price and quality of food. The decor is a little funny but the food outshines any decorating job they could have done. Be patient when they are busy as it is family owned and run, so sometimes it can be slow but the food makes it all worth while. Very authentic and you will have left overs. 

GO HERE!!!"}
