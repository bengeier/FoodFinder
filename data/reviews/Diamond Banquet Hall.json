{"text":"Great dim sum! The place was easy to get to, with lots of parking. We had no trouble getting a table (even without reservations!) and we added several new favourites to our list of \"must-have\" dishes (peanut pancakes!). Order off cards. As the restaurant was part of a large plaza full of different Asian restaurants, we treated ourselves to some Vietnamese coffee afterwards.  Visited: June 15, 2014  Update: Our group went back on June 21, 2015. It was still good food at a good price, but was somewhat noisy.  It would be worth returning to with a smaller group at a table in a less noisy location.    We had seafood pizza again, the vegetarian goose (tofu), which was deliciously seasoned; we had beef meatballs with dried mandarin; chicken-ginger buns as a nice change from BBQ pork buns; and curried cuttlefish, mashed taro, pork-ginger dumplings, and lots of shrimp dishes too!  With 9 people we came away at just $13/person. A great deal!"}
{"text":"Came for dim sum on a Sunday.  The food was above average but so was the price.  Overall, one of the cleaner Chinese restaurants also."}
{"text":"My family have been regulars at this place for the past five or so yrs and it never disapoints.  Staple dim sum with a few unique items that are fairly priced. Steamed items always freshly made on site and not from frozen like many downtown dim sum joints.  One additional bonus you don't get with many Chinese restaurants...good service. They're busy so you might not get 5 star treatment...but you won't get attitude when asking for more tea/hot sauce etc.  Food portions have been shrinking a bit in the past little while. Might be their answer to inflation. Don't expect it to be quiet either....not the place to do trancendental meditation or anything. Overall a good solid TO dim sum."}
{"text":"It was so ironic that 5 Chinese men (including two born from Hong Kong) would drive almost 11 hours from NYC to Canada and end up at a Chinese restaurant for dim sum on a Sunday morning. To keep everything simple and clear, Diamond serves one of the best authentic Hong Kong styled dim sums I ever tasted outside of Hong Kong. The quality here far excel than those served back in NY. There were no auntie aged waitresses running around with steam hot shopping carts that constantly irritate you for a new dish. Everything was simplified to a pencil and a small menu slip to write down your selection. Given how hungry we were, we almost left no check box unmarked on that slip, and even the waitress were amazed at the amount of food that we selected. Many of the dishes were great in terms of flavor and presentation, especially the all-time-favorite ones like the: chicken feet, shrimp dumplings, beef balls...etc. Here at Diamond, we even discovered a few new dishes that were never seen back in New York. For instance, there was a variation on the shrimp dumpling where they added whole scallops and a steamed dish of duck feet wrapped in tofu skin all soaked in delicious sauce. I was so glade they also serve the fried salty dumplings, although to be honest the quality was not so top rated.   We had a fantastic meal at Diamond, and each one of us ate till we  all couldn't take it anymore, but it was definitely a great experience. i would stop by this place again if I ever visit Toronto."}
{"text":"I'd like to think I'm bit of a dim sum connoisseur. I've had dim sum in plenty of places, including, Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, and Hong Kong. Toronto Dim sum is truly top notch on the world stage, and Diamond is no exception. The quality of the food was very good, and they used a few extra spices which was an excellent interpretation on the dishes. Service was good enough, and although I truly miss the dim sum cart experience, it is probably more efficient and fresher to do the check list menu style. Had a great time with family!"}
{"text":"This dim sum place is definitely above average, though not the best in Toronto in my opinion. It has very consistent quality and menu updates once in a while with new dishes. Price is fair and atmosphere is bright and clean. Most staffs speak good English. There's a new pan-fried squid cake which I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"the food quality is same as other dim sum place, but.more pricy.. with the price that we paid, I expected a better. service is okay foods are slow to arrive."}
{"text":"We were seated and serviced quickly with yummy food. My family and I appreciated the excellent customer service and their attention to detail. They made sure that we were satisfied with our food and comfortable with our seating. Thank you."}
{"text":"Dim sum times are busy but dinner time is so dead.  I csme on Monday night 8pm there is NO ONE and even when I left ano ONE came in. Food quality is good, service is alright, wine opening fee is $5 (which isnt bad at all!). If you get there fish soup its quite good but don't let it sit cause it gets fishy when it gets cold."}
{"text":"Rare visit to the Markham area for dimsum and before hiking so thought I would bring friends up here and work up an appetite.  Thanks to a few people being late we did not get here till 2pm by which time most the crowds had gone. My friends decided it was there chance to order all manner of items which I don't like so that sucked. Urggh to pigs blood or whatever it is.  After ordering the food and service was pretty slow. Why is it so hard to get a decent serving of hot sauce, that stuff is treated like its rare.  Non of the items impressed, not one compared to place I have been downtown, so that was a big surprise as everyone keeps telling me Markham is where its at.  Will try a different place next time I trek to the burbs."}
{"text":"Used to think this restaurant is alright until now. Not only they provide poor service, but also serve left over food. We ordered BBQ duck noodles. First the meat doesn't look fresh. The meat was reheated by deep frying. Even the server admitted the BBQ duck was left over. He argued, the restaurant was open late, how would they have time to make it. To my understanding, all of the BBQ meat have to make fresh everyday, early in the morning. It is common sense, if you don't have the ingredients, don't serve it. That means they don't take their food quality seriously. They don't care about your health seriously. The noodles they serve is not even the one they described. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"This was a set holidays dinner so all I had to do was show up and enjoy the experience.  My hosts mentioned the owner is from  Very Fair Chinese restaurant has bought this place. Menu was quite similar but we had some different items this time as were a larger (2 table group) Jelly fish with BBQ Pork. I only tried the Jelly fish and it was seasoned well.  Scallops with mixed vegetables: Quite good. Ended up being one of the better dishes on this visit Stuffed crab claw. I luv this dish but sadly this hasn't improved here. A sub par version of this dish IMO. Chinese Style Beef steak. This was memorable on the other spot this one was a complete miss . Shark fin soup. This was a below average version of this dish just like the other spot. Dried scallops with mushroom. This was an improvement over the other spot, Humongous mushrooms with the not so dry version of the scallops this time. Chicken: Devoid of taste and mushy in texture. Steamed Grouper with scallions. It was decent and not way overcooked. Fried lobster. Can't go wrong here I suppose nothing out of ordinary here just decent. Noodles and rice. Fillers IMO and served their purpose well. I enjoyed the noodles.  Dessert offerings as expected were forgetful.  2.5 stars is pushing it already."}
{"text":"They have the pan fried veggie bean curd rolls that i cant find anywhere else. so they have my love forever. it is on the pricey side of dim sum."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times for dim sum now, but I'm still on the fence on whether I like it or not. There a couple good things, but also a couple not so good things.  First off, the food is okay. Certain things are done well, while others are definitely things I would steer clear. There is a Taro and Lap Cheung Fried Rice that was really well done. Good amount of ingredients in the rice, and tasted delicious. They also have good Fried Octopus Tentacles. However, the Sticky Rice Rolls are impossible to eat. They are completely stuck together to the point that you can even take them apart to eat. You'd essentially have to rip them apart. Also, the desserts here are a bit lacklustre. Everything is mediocre in terms of taste, except the Mango Pudding.   Service is not too bad, food does come rather quickly to the table, but there are small things that could be changed. The order sheets are beautifully printed on glossy paper, but when you want order another round (or two), they don't give you a new sheet! So you'd have to write on the same sheet over and over again, but then they explain they don't understand what you want to order! I would recommend NOT printing on such nice paper and having copies where you can hand out multiples.   Overall, not a place I enjoy going to, but my grandparents like it, so I'm sure we'll be back..."}
{"text":"Not busy at all on a Sunday morning for dim sum.  Buns were stale and the dishes was cracked and dirty.  The food is definitely not spectacular.  Would not go back again."}
{"text":"Tonight's dinner was absolutely disastrous. We had been here for dim sum a couple times before and it wasn't bad. We decided to try the dinner here. We get there for dinner and was given the table closest to the door. There were some plates and cups out, but not complete sets and the tablecloth was dirty - not sure if it was being used as a spare for the time being or what happened, but that didn't matter much.   We place our order with a waiter, and waited half an hour before we figured it was taking way too long for even the starter soup. Asked another waitress if our order was even punched in, and she said she would check. It took her a long time to check, so we asked the guy who placed our order if he had punched it in and his reply was \"ok\". The other waitress finally gets back to us asking to order again. We placed a new order with her, and she punched it in, but this was 45 minutes from when we first sat. A couple minutes later we get the soup - fair. We didn't get our first food dish until ANOTHER hour. Everything else came out really slow. Food was very salty and is nothing really special compared to other Chinese restaurants.   The service today was absolutely horrible. Usually dinners at these restaurants take around an hour for us, this dinner took 2.5 hours. We were here celebrating my dad's birthday and it was probably the worst birthday dinner he's had. Definitely will not return."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum on Labour Day with my family.  We decided to \"class it up\" a bit since we have relatives in from Hong Kong than taking them to our usual dumpy dim sum places - though if you ask me, the food is just as good in those places, if not better!  The pros of going to a higher end dim sum places usually include:  Better service Less wait times Specialty items Better ambiance/decor/seating  Of the 4 pros, they excelled at 2, and failed in 2.   We arrived at around 10:30AM before the mad rush of 11AM came around (this is usually the time a dim sum restaurant starts getting busy and you have to start taking a number!)  The smaller tables were getting called much faster (which makes sense because how much can 2 people eat really?)  It seemed they only had 3 larger tables and I noticed that they implemented their sectional to section off part of the restaurant, presumably for a night banquet/function given the red table cloths and special table setting.  I couldn't help but feel a bit irked that they didn't open up that section of the restaurant to accommodate the crowds that were now all tapping their feet in impatience.  Our biggest mistake was not making a reservation - though that counts for little.  You still have to wait, but it just means that if you have a reservation and there are 4 tables of 4 waiting, you get bumped up to the top.  Its not a TRUE reservation in the sense of the word.  At approximately 11:10AM we were finally seated at a table that was meant more for 8 than it was for 10, so we had a very \"intimate\" family dim sum that morning to say the least.  We ordered more than our stomachs could hold (this is what happens when you have multiple people ticking off things on the menu.  When this happens, we only see the items we ticked off, but fail to see the other dozen items that were already pre-selected which results in a WHOLE lotta food that we can't finish being shoved into styrofoam take-out boxes for later and an expensive bill.  Ours fell shy of $120 for a table of 10 with tax and tip, which, by dim sum standards is pretty pricey.)  They had the standard dim sum items but some specialty ones as well: Korean Short Ribs, Papaya/Milk Tarts, Salted Egg Yolk Steamed Custard Buns, Salted Egg Yolk Sesame Balls, Osamanthus-Lychee-Goji Jelly, Deep Fried Sticky Rice to name a few.    The dim sum is priced according to size (S/M/L/XL).  It is a tick-the-paper system as opposed to the old-school push-cart system here.  Their marketing team really tries to sell you with the \"fancied\" up names they try to give to standard dim sum items.  Golden this, dragon that.    The service wasn't particularly stellar.  The ladies who bring out your orders could stand to smile a bit more.  I found that they were rather rude.  We had asked if they could cut some of the dim sum items in half with scissors and she grumpily replied \"I don't have any\" and huffed off to the next table.  The dim sum chef could use a lesson or 2 in making a Shrimp/Scallop Dumpling that doesn't fall apart.  Most people would place blame on my amateur chopstick-holding skills, but even my elders who hold it the \"proper\" way had difficulty keeping these babies in one piece.    The Korean Short Ribs were a bit on the dry side albeit tasty.  The papaya tart was anything but exciting.  Perhaps my expectations were too high.  Alas, another restaurant in \"Rich\"mond Hill that has disappointed me.  For me, the lot of them are not worth the trek just for dim sum as there are plenty of options in Scarborough that are just as good, for a fraction of the cost, and a quarter of the gas."}
{"text":"My new place to have Sunday dim sum. Buy the VIP card and get 10% off your meal. Price if the card varies depending on how long ...3 months,  a year, etc... But worth it if you come a couple times a month, which we do.  I prefer the check off and order vs waiting for the carts to come around. Food quality is good. Price is fair compared to downtown places (and food is much better).  Host is very nice and remembers my family.   Service is better than other places (so says our friends who joined us today)."}
{"text":"Dim Sum at a Banquet Hall and I went in wearing very CASUAL.  What's great about this place is the High Ceiling which gives you an open space and has a good mix of Tradtional/Modern decor.  The table settings and chairs felt like I went to Shenzhen where the table clothes and the chair coverings look pricier than the clothes on your back, at least MY clothes.  Dim Sum selection was nothing out of the ordinary, maybe just some additions to CLASSY it up in comparison to your $2.00 Dim Sum places.  Prices are categorized by S/M/L/XL/SP where items begin at $2.50/3.50/4.20/5.20/6.20 respectively.  How's the food? Nothing unusual let's just leave it at that.  The Bean Curd Sheet Roll in Supreme Soup didn't turn out the way I like it.  I usually like the Bean Curd to be softly steamed without breaking apart but the ones here looked DRY and over-fried.  The Siu Mai and Shrimp Dumplings were acceptable as so was the Shrimp Rice Roll but it definitely is NOT where your value goes to.  The value of this place is that you're paying for the decor.  Look at the photos and determine for yourself.  I do like one of their WALL LITERATURES!"}
{"text":"This was almost a 4. Came for my cousin's wedding last Saturday night. Private room, which was nice.  Had: some super expensive banquet meal.  Roasted piglet - juicy meat, crispy skin, but not the best I've ever had. I'd give it a 3.5/5. Stir-fried snow peas, celery, scallop, conch - Conch was delicious. The rest of it was fairly standard. Shark fin soup with crab meat - good amount of shark fin. Real crab meat. My gripe with this was that it had the strangest consistency. It was slimy (like snot). It did not drip. It was gooey. The broth was also quite bland. Snow pea shoots with abalone and sea cucumber - abalone was tender. Snow pea shoots were fresh and delicious. They cooked the snow pea shoots in our room, so they were still super hot when they served them to us. Crispy chicken - crispy skin, tender meat. Lobster stir fried with maggi sauce - Typical. I believe it was steamed bass, but I could have been mistaken - I'm not usually a big fan of steamed fish at restaurants (I prefer it at home), but this was delicious.  E-fu noodles in broth with dumpling - I am not a fan of e-fu in broth. I like my e-fu braised or wok-fried. This was alright. Dumpling had a thin skin and a lot of shrimp and Chinese fungus in it. The filling was a tad chunky for me though. Abalone fried rice - looks like yeung chow fried rice, but with what looks like bits of Chinese shiitake mushroom. Not mushroom. Abalone. Good amount of abalone. Tender abalone. Delicious fried rice. Desserts - assorted cookies, peanut sweet soup with black bean glutinous rice dumplings. Peanut soup was not fragrant enough. It was also the same gooey, slimy texture as the shark fin soup. Cookies were not bad.  Service was quite good. I'm docking marks for the consistencies of both the shark fin soup and the dessert soup. Other than that, not bad."}
{"text":"One star is really because of the bug we found in our dimsum dish. Their attitude and service after the incident were great in comparison with that of other dimsum restaurants, but the sheer fact that there was a bug in the dimsum is revolting.  Our party of 3 came for dimsum/lunch tea time at around 11am on a Saturday and were seated quickly. We ordered 7 types of dimsum and all the food came very, very quickly - like all of it within 5-10 minutes of ordering, which is very fast for a typical restaurant at peak lunch time on a weekend. Our dimsum all tasted fine, except when we were almost finished all our food, and about 3/4 finished the bean curd + duck feet + meat + mushroom dimsum dish, we noticed a bug wrapped inside the bean curd. Absolutely disgusting and revolting.  The manager apologized profusely and told us that it was likely from the mushroom after coming back from the kitchen. The dimsum was taken off our order, we were charged for 1 person's tea charge, as opposed to 3, and a 10% discount. While their attitude and followup was pretty good, in comparison with other dimsum restaurants, the fact that there was a bug in our food, is disgusting and revolting."}
{"text":"Dim sum is okay, but way expensive. Casa Victoria is much better but some how the bill at Diamond came out ahead?"}
{"text":"Date: 09/29/2013 - dim sum  Service : 1 / 5 Environment : 3 / 5 Food & Drinks : 2.5 / 5 Price : 2.5 / 5  Overall : 9 / 20  Comments - this place was empty on a Sunday morning at prime dim sum time (10am).  That speaks alot for a restaurant that is in prime location. - food was mediocre       - Chiu Chow Dumplings had a really thick dumpling wrapper      - Beef tendon came out just warm, wasn't braised long enough so it was still kind of hard.  - they need to stop duck-taping the carpet to the floor, because it looks disgusting with dirty stuck to the peeling edges of the tape.   if i remember correctly, prices as follows for dim sum  S - $2.7 M - $3.7 L  - $4.7 XL - $x (can't recall this one)"}
{"text":"The dim sum here used to be better but now it is just ok. Maybe they changed chef now. The food was good when we went here for a wedding last year but we felt they put too much MSG on the food. Our throat was really dry when we got home and toward the end of dinner. I don't think the food here is that healthy and maybe a bit too salty on some dishes. I heard the food here used to be a lot better before compared to now for wedding and dim sum. The decor was ok/basic for weddings and the service was good. The staff were nice and attentive during the wedding. Overall service and food quality was ok. Not spectacular or amazing. Look at the value, taste test the food and compare prices before you book this venue for wedding or special events."}
{"text":"the server gave one of the people in my party a horribly cracked cup, so we asked for another one. The cleanliness is never a strong point of Chinese Dim Sum restaurants, and it should be noted that you should clean your cutlery and plates before eating an extra time to make sure you aren't eating someone else's leftovers.  The service and food was pretty average in comparison to the other dim sum restaurants nearby. The restaurant was pretty empty, which probably explained the quick service and quick food we got that day."}
{"text":"I've been here for dim sum several times and have always been pleased with the food and service. Tonight, however, I was here for a ten course wedding banquet so this is not your typical review.  I don't know if they made an extra effort because of the occasion but the food was very tasty and the service was fast and friendly. Each course was brought to our table and served to us very efficiently on new plates for each course.  If they do things this well all the time, I may just have to come back for dinner one evening."}
{"text":"This review is for the dim sum only.  I came for dim sum last weekend with a big group.  We ordered about 2 orders of dim sum per person plus a stir fried rice.  All the dishes were tasty; the quality definitely beat the flat price dim sum places.  The dim sum, though not exquisite, were damn good, and they were reasonably priced starting at $2.7 for small (forgot the prices of the other sizes).  The portion of the stri fried rice was good, even if it was at lunch price.  Overall, a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"2nd time here. Nothing really to point out. Tried an item I have never seen before which was the deep fried sticky rice. Not much flavour and didn't really like it."}
{"text":"Menu driven dim sum (no carts), standard fair - nothing really unique.  They do make their dumplings in house (I believe) as they are a bit different than the standard (Chiu style dumpings for example).  The  squid tentacles yu yu so, were dry - wouldn't order them.  The steamed chicken and rice was good - overall the food was standard to what you would expect at a downtown dim sum restaurant.  Atmosphere and service were quite good.  I wouldn't drive out of my way to go back, and if at the plaza would try somewhere else (Ding Tai is great)."}
{"text":"We come here often as it is a family favourite. It is spacious and beautiful for a dim sum place or dinner. They also have amazing lion dancers around Chinese New Year time with a banquet at dim sum time.  The food is always good quality and hot, in my experience. A big shout out to Frankie who is so awesome and friendly and checks in on my kid. What a sweetheart!"}
{"text":"Way back when Markham's dim sum restaurant boom was in its infancy, Diamond was regarded as the cream of the crop. However, times have changed, and while Diamond is still regarded as one of the higher end dim sum places, its quality and prestige has taken a nosedive.  I came here recently for dim sum on a Sunday, and it was hella busy. I did expect the crowds, as this place is one of the few dim sum places in a 2km radius.  Dim sum menu selections weren't vast, but the uniqueness does make up for it. Not a lot of places offer braised ox tail as a dim sum selection, for example. Their beef tendon also tastes different from other places.  Their shrimp dumplings weren't very good, as the skin was too sticky. I kept having to eat the shrimp without the skin as it consistently fell off. I also didn't like the beef tripe as it was too thick for my liking. The siu mai was good, as well as the curry cuttlefish.  Service was poor in terms of the fact they were horribly understaffed. Considering the size, I only saw 4 servers actually taking care of tables...that's way too little. It took forever to wave someone down to take down our dim sum menu or to get the bill. They also looked extremely overworked, and I don't blame them at all.  I'll probably not return unless I'm specifically told to come here. It is convenient for the fact my dad works here, and if we have a social gathering he can just walk to work after."}
{"text":"Under new ownership. Dim Sum was okay but service was really slow. They mixed up our table number and our food keeps going to another table before it came to us. There are better places for Dim Sum."}
{"text":"Attended a really fun wedding here this past weekend.  Since I didn't really know the wedding couple - I had a lot of time to sit and people watch and check out the establishment.  The entire hall was rented for this wedding ... which totaled about 25-30 tables.  The bridal party had theirs set up on a small stage right above the dance floor.  Good sound system.  I liked the flat panel TV's and large video screens scattered throughout the entire hall which provided almost every seat in the house a good view of the bridal table.  I could EAT and watch their video montage!  As far as Chinese wedding banquets go - this was pretty good.  Granted I think I sat at an important table so maybe we had service faster than others.  Each round was brought out one by one and the server divvyed up everything.  This worked out well because my personal drink per capita was about 4 so there wouldn't have been a lot of room for huge platters of food.  And having someone divvy up the food ensures you get a shrimp.  Not a ton of courses ... 6-7 and it was just right.  Timing on the food was also very good.  I didn't walk away hungry ... (drunk maybe ... but that's a different story).    I thought the food itself was also pretty good.  Nothing overly exotic or fancy ... but food served hot and fresh.  At least 5 sharks (and their fins) were sacrificed for this meal ... okay just kidding."}
{"text":"FOOD- 4 stars All the dimsum we ordered came hot, which i like. all your general siu mai, har gow and etc are pretty decent here. The rice rolls aren't bad either. I do recommend their rice bowls, those were a highlight for me. ALSO, since my family like REALLY hot tea, the tea was up to their standards.  SERVICE - 2 stars Ugh, inattentive and really dismissive attitude. I really hate when you're talking to someone and they are looking elsewhere.. like hello ?!?! Also they are slow as hell when trying to get change for the bill and asking for utensils or anything of that sort."}
{"text":"went there for a friend's wedding banquet. the venue is nice and conducive to wedding parties (although i sat right behind a pillar and couldn't see the stage at all); there is a dance floor in the middle, projection screen connected to computer slide shows, and center stage for the wedding party.  food was on par; nothing spectacular but not inferior either. what i'm not crazy about was their service.  either they need to hire some more professional waiters, or they need to whip up their training. when i arrived at my table, the other people there had sat on our seats and then moved around, thus some of the place settings were shifted or missing. when i asked the waitress to replenish my set, she didn't see what was missing even though my spot was completely empty. she went on counting sets around the table, and only shifted whatever she saw back onto my spot, failing to see that i was still missing pieces from the set. um, need me to do it myself?  since everybody seemed so busy, my bf got up to the wine table to get ourselves some wine. i got a glass from the tray that had just traveled around the room. that was less than ideal (temperature-wise and all), but i'm not a snob. however, expecting me to drink from a glass with little speckles inside--and then one w/lipstick mark on--is just a little too much to ask. had my bf return the wine (twice!) and got another glass; sitting right by the wine station, i could sense that the staff wasn't too happy about me having standards on sanitation.  i know having two banquets happening in one night is tough, and the staff may just be ad-hoc part-time helpers. still, if you bring that kind of service to the table, it is unlikely that new customers will be enticed to patronize at other times."}
{"text":"I've been eating here almost every Sunday for lunch, the food is pretty good and most employees are quite cheerful!"}
{"text":"I think this is just adequate. Amongst the chatter between my mom and her friends and relatives, apparently this is all the hype because there are live performances sometimes.   We decided to have a dim sum lunch here on a Sunday with relatives -10 people at this table!   Their dim sum was actually pricey. Do they have specials? We visited here at 11am and left at around 1-2pm... so it was a long lunch but we probably caught the \"morning prices\" because they were expensive!! The prices were, in my opinion, more towards the \"premium dim sum\" side but the food was only average.   I also thought their menu was quite short! Yes they have the typical shrimp dumplings, pork siu mai, and even the abalone soup dumpling (which was a joke! The abalone was so tiny, I wish they'd just skip it!!). When I go for dim sum at other restaurants, I am able to happily check off at least 10 items... but at Diamond Banquet Hall, for some reason I checked off only 2.. and I handed the menu off to relatives. Maybe I didn't understand the fancy names? Maybe I didn't like that the dishes I'd order were mostly under \"L\" or \"XL\"? *  And the service wasn't that great. I'm not sure if one of the floor staff** was new because she seems to know all the staff? But she sure acted like it was her first day! And the people who brought us food were so rude, and I noticed one was rude even to the floor staff.   MEH. I'm giving this 2 stars because the food wasn't terrible... it was just average. But I wouldn't visit again on my own***  *Dim sum dishes under \"S\" (Small) are cheapest. Items under \"XL\" are the most expensive.  **Floor staff are the people whose job is to do everything EXCEPT bring food from the kitchen.  ***Usually my family/relatives pick the restaurants for lunches... Apparently I am \"a child\" and also because I'm not paying ;)"}
