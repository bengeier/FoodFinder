{"text":"Used to be a good bar. New owners are trashy and they now have a security guard there because of all the fights. Never seen a security guard at the place for years until the new owner took over a couple months ago. Pushed out all the regulars."}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood bar! Stumbled across this place a few weeks ago. They have great food, a friendly staff, and daily specials worth checking out. If you like a place where you can grab a bite, a couple of drinks, and play some pool with friends this place is the perfect spot!"}
