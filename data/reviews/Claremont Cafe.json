{"text":"Went for lunch for the first time.  Nice patio, nice decor, service was really friendly and efficient but it ended there.  The food was less then appetizing. I took the Beef Burger and it had a funky taste to it.  Thought it was me so I had my friend try and she thought the same. She had the spinach salad but it was drowning oil.   I really think this could be a cool place so I'll give it another try on a different day and hopefully get better results.  I'll update this review soon."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the mussels last time I was there.iI didn't want the fries so I was given salad. The hamburger is ok and my friend liked her fish and chips."}
{"text":"Pricey for what you get. I've tried:  Veggie burger - not great and it's deep fried. Eggplant pasta dish - very bland. Spinach salad - pretty good but very oily."}
{"text":"I had a great meal here with my grandmother, wife, and two young children.  The sangria was fantastic, and the moule frites delicious.  The service was very pleasant, but a bit slow.  The decor is tasteful enough to feel classy but not so much that I felt out of place bringing my children in for lunch.  It certainly isn't cheap, but neither would I call it outrageous.  For a respectable place to get a nice relaxed meal, I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"If I give a start it is just for the friendly staff working there. The food quality is pretty poor! The worst tasteless Poutine! I ever tried in Montreal! The thing they offer as a Pizza is called \"Flammekueches\" in other places and is much cheaper! The place itself is cool, but you pay too much for the food they offer!"}
{"text":"Great ambience, but the food...not so much. I had the veggie burger which came with BOTH a side of fries and salad! The burger was tasteless and I was forced to slather it in ketchup and relish. The fries (I had yam for +$2) were limp and not crispy. On a slightly positive note, the portions were passable for the price."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the overall vibe of this place, the service, the homemade habanero hot-sauce (that I generously poured in my Caesar and mayonnaise), and my gigantic pile of mussels.   I feel I will spend many an hour here wrestling down spicy drinks and mountains of shellfish...and rightfully so."}
{"text":"The food was good here but can be better.  I got a nicoise salad with tuna.  I was so surprised to find pickled green beans in my salad.  That's pretty random and I didn't think it fit into the salad.  Good thing about it is the location, just 2 blocks from where I usually stay when I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, order came a little messed up but they fixed it right away and we had a nice lunch.  Club was good, the sweet potato fries were excellent and my wife's salad was very good!  Would def. recommend!"}
{"text":"We were exhausted after a day of traveling and so grateful for friendly service and a nice tomato soup that came right out. My partner got the braised beef- was his favorite bite of the weekend. I got the salmon Nicoise which was perfectly executed without innovation. Nice interior."}
{"text":"Great salad selection and quality, AND there was room for my stroller at lunch which made my day!"}
{"text":"Le Claremont Café a été une belle surprise. Je ne connais pas les recoins de NDG/Westmount beaucoup mais j'ai été désignée comme personne qui devait choisir un resto/bar pour prendre un verre et une petite bouchée avant d'aller passer une soirée au Centre d'art Crowley. Je suis contente d'avoir relevé le défi avec succès!  Quand je suis arrivée, un bon 15 minutes avant mes copines, j'ai eu amplement d'options pour choisir l'endroit où m'asseoir. J'ai pensé choisir une table sur la petite terrasse, mais il y avait déjà un groupe qui y fumait donc j'ai pris une table entre le resto et la tersasse pour avoir le meilleur des 2 mondes. À peine 20 minutes plus tard, le reste de la place c'est rempli de groupes d'amis, de familles et de couples de tous les âges.  La liste des vins et des cocktails est intéressante. J'ai choisi un Malbec parce que je voulais une boisson passe-partout qui se marieraient avec n'importe quel plats mais les martinis avaient aussi l'air très appétissants. Une fois mes copines arrivée, ça nous a pris un peu de temps à décider ce qu'elles voulaient boire...il y a eu un grand débat sur les mérites du chardonnay!  Au lieu de choisir chacune un plat principal, on a décidé de se partager quelques entrées. Le Grille Brie, les calmars frits et la salade de betteraves (et courges, pistaches, poires, fêta et vinaigre balsamique) nous ont bouché un coin. Tout était très bon. Les calmars étaient cuits à perfection - pas trop mous ni trop durs.  Définitivement un découverte qui pourrait devenir un endroit fréquenté régulièrement si jamais j'ai affaire à retrouner dans ce recoin de la ville."}
{"text":"The Claremont has a great location and a nice little terrace the decor inside is also well done but the food could use some work, especially for the price. Not suggesting that the restaurant is really expensive just wish that the food was decent for the cost.  I have eaten here on two occasions and was not impressed either time. The first time I had what the waitress claimed was her favorite which was the Arugula & Duck salad and found it was ok but nothing special and the second time I went I had what the waitress claimed was the most popular item on the menu which was the mussels in a thai broth with french fries, the fries were fantastic but the mussels weren't great.  I really want to love this place cause it has the possibility to be great, they just need a new chef that understands flavors better and with some minor adjustments it will be a great place"}
