{"text":"Last night was my first time here. My friend and I tried coming a few times before and it was way too crowded so we were finally able to get in.  The place is very neat and clean and he's beautiful wall art.   Our server was very friendly and funny.   I'm usually a boring chicken fajita person but I tried the chicken flautas and they were absolutely delicious! They came with a side of rice and refried beans.  My friend had the #20 combination and I honestly cannot remember what all was on it but it was good.  The amount of food you get is awesome and the prices are great!   We definitely are going back!   It's nice to have a place like this close to home.  I was spoiled living in San Diego for so long."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food everytime..clean and the people have very good customer service."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food around! My husband and I really enjoy going there for lunch and dinner. The restaurant has a nice ambiance, the servers are friendly and the food is delicious. We always get the chimichanga's and always good."}
{"text":"this place is always busy. I set them apart from other Mexican places in the area because it seems they have a much bigger menu and that's always a plus. the servers are always very nice and make conversation. the chicken yolandas are my fave!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican we've had since moving to the Greensburg area.  Biggest downfall, it's expensive!!  Dishes were large and well seasoned.  Meats were cooked tenderly and sautéed just right.  Generous portions with guacamole, salsas, and queso dip.  Would have given 5 stars but the price is a big downfall for me."}
{"text":"For authentic Mexican in the area, Acapulco doesn't disappoint. The beers are cold and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Where to begin..I'm suprised this place has so many good reviews..The pico de gallo came out with guacamole in which I never seen that before...it wasn't good...I ordered the Carne Asade..I took one bite and that was it..had no taste whatsoever and was thick and fatty..The service is slow and takes forever ..Our 3 tacos came out and waiting for salsa to put on them I ate one since I was hungry n and  sent back the Carne Asada. ..needless to say I never got any salsa for my tacos so I didn't eat the rest of them as well..Would not recommend this place to anybody and will never go back..Sorry I even drove  20 minutes for this place..If you want good Mexican food go to El Campensino in Monroeville like I normally do..luckily I just walked down to 5guys to fill my appetite"}
{"text":"Average food quality. Good option if you are not sure where else to go. Nice staff. Plastic menus have an old towel smell to it."}
{"text":"Service is friendly and attentive. Food is amazing; have had carnitas, chimichanga, flautas, tacos, taco salad. All very good. Portions are large. Prices are fair. Eat here about once a week and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very authentic Mexican fare. It gets pretty busy in the evenings. Definitely a great place to grab a meal. We had churros this time and I loved them. Next time I'm going to try the Dulce De Leche Cheesecake. It looks really good. I'm not usually much of a dessert person so that really says something."}
{"text":"Use to love it .changed product .and cook am assuming terrible ..shame bragged about it to everyone"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican fare in North Huntingdon; we've been here many times and have never been disappointed.  Great food, good size portions, and fast, excellent service.  We've never had to wait for a table, but there are always customers.  I love the team approach to the table service; our glasses were never empty, and someone passes by every few minutes to check on you!  Along with the burritos, enchiladas, and cheese sauce . . . the traditional sangria is also a favorite! Very highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have a great vegetarian menu!! (a rare find in this part of town).. the service is always attentive, and the salsa is fantastic. The only criticism is that their margaritas  could use a little more booze.. although they are still tasty.  :)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I have decided if I ever go back it will be for the food, and for the food only. I really like it - it deserves 4 stars. The service however stunk both times. The 2nd time our table needed wiped off. We asked our waiter so he just did it with his hand. In all my years eating out I have NEVER experienced that. (I'm almost 60 years old!) And nobody checked back to be sure everything was ok. They weren't very busy so there was no excuse not to check back.  If I ever go back I'll need to have the mindset walking in that the food will be good but the service won't. Then maybe I can say I'm glad I went, because I am not feeling it right now. If the food wasn't so good the place wouldn't deserve to be patronized."}
{"text":"I actually really loved this place! I don't typically have high expectations for strip mall Mexican spots... There are a few others in the region that I find to be huge disappointments. Also, my eyes start to cross when I look at the menus with literally hundreds of choices. Despite its insanely lengthy menu, I was pleased on all points with Acapulco.   For starters, the service was so extremely friendly and quick. We brought our four very young children, which is typically pretty much a nightmare for absolutely everyone involved--the server, the neighboring tables, and yes, even us parents who just want to enjoy the simple luxury of to eating a meal that we didn't have to cook and we don't need to clean up afterwards. Luckily, this time it was a dream, not a nightmare- our server was so friendly and good with kids that he put us at ease. The delicious chips and salsa kept the kids happy while we waited for our food which was served promptly.   To be honest, I don't remember exactly what we ordered...a few combos, a few burritos... Basically we just started frantically pointing at menu items and hoped we'd like them. And we did! Way more flavor and freshness than most Mexican joints. The burrito was a real standout...it was big, filled with chicken and beef and shrimp--all of which were flavorful and cooked to perfection--and topped with a savory sauce.   We are planning to return to this place sans kids so that we can sit and enjoy a little longer. The interior of the restaurant is more spacious than we anticipated; it's very pleasant and relaxing. This place is absolutely very kid-friendly but would also make a great spot for a more leisurely meal."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Westmorland County and surrounding! I have tried others in the area including a new one and this is the best. Food is authentic fresh and tasty! The chili rellenos are to die for! They cheese on nacho amazing! Never had a bad meal! The service amazing and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"The service is impeccable! The culture is authentic and the food is fantastic! Every time i go in, they greet me right at the door and are so friendly. i definitely recommend the burrito supreme!"}
{"text":"Not our first visit an definitely not our last. The good food at a reasonable price will keep us coming back. Family friendly atmosphere means I take my grandkids with no reservation.   The standard fare (combination platters) are Mexican comfort food served in a friendly manner that makes the meal a delight.   There are some specialities that I want to try in the future."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Westmorland County and surrounding! I have tried others in the area including a new one and this is the best. They cheese on the nachos is amazing! Never had a bad meal! The service amazing and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, and great prices.  They pretty much have the same things as every other independent Mexican restaurant in town, but the food was all good, and I can say we'll definitely be back.  Also, get dessert, they are super cheap.  We got fried ice cream, it was under $4, maybe even $3, I can't remember.  Other places charge $5 or more, so I usually pass on dessert at most places, but here it was hard to pass up for the price."}
{"text":"The best Mexican around!! Great flavors always hot fast service big variety of menu I did see a comment on here and somebody else and so they're doing scampi with the chips and salsa I do agree with that because he's got a nice nice basketball that you don't anymore it's a small serving but is it is good but I wish it were they go back to the bigger basket of chips and salsa"}
{"text":"Decent prices, Mexican is not the best but not to bad for the area. as you sit they don't give you the yummy cheese sauce for a dip you must request and I think it's extra!. Salsa is not that great."}
{"text":"Lived in Southern California for 22 years, very familiar with Mexican food and this restaurant is the REAL DEAL !  What a treat to have delicious,  authentic Mexican food in my neighborhood!  Excellent, friendly customer service every time, whether dining in or take out !"}
{"text":"Excellent food, reasonable prices. Fave is the spicy verde sauce on both the skirt steak and carnitas.   Muy bueno!"}
{"text":"Great, authentic Mexican food! I love the salsa, chicken fajitas and shrimp seviche. The restaurant is very clean and the staff is super nice."}
{"text":"This place impresses me just like the old Mexican place that used to be in Irwin. There are a lot of Mexicans working there and are very friendly and helpful. The menu has a ton of choices and are not too Americanized. The prices are pretty reasonable as well.  So if you're in Irwin and want some Mexican, skip Taco Bell because this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I have been to Acapulco several times all of them were delicious. Mexican food is not necessarily my favorite but here I love it! Many thanks to all the staff."}
{"text":"Acapulco is a sweet little part of mexico located in irwin pa. The food the wait staff everything is delightful. My favorite part is the atmosphere. The restaurant is spectacular! They never forget you either!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I have had since I lived in Southern California. The staff is courteous and friendly. The food is well above par. They use fresh veggies and spices.  I live a quarter mile from another Mexican restaurant and I always make the drive here because it is so much better. I recommend the ceviche and the pollo adobe. You definitely cannot go wrong at Acapulco.  They expanded from a smaller restaurant down the street and the New restaurant is inviting and convenient to route 30. Definitely give it a go!"}
{"text":"Gran experiencia! One way to accurately gauge the customer appreciation level at a restaurant, is to walk through their doors near closing time. One will immediately discover if they are truly happy to see you.  Our first visit here occurred with less than 30 minutes to go before closing time. Generally,  I avoid such decisions, since I expect to encounter sour faces and rushed service.  Imagine my reaction when we were warmly welcomed, and greeted, with a smile.  Mega points earned.    We decided to take advantage of the .99 cent chicken or beef Taco Tuesday special.  Both were flavorful and filling.  Sides dishes of rice and beans were full portions.  Due to time constraints,  I did not read through the full menu, and cannot comment on such. However,  a return visit is already planned based on the friendliness of the staff, and the tasteful first meal we had at Acapulco."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Always friendly staff, very fast food and it taste great every time!! Love the chicken flautas and cheese dip!"}
{"text":"The food and staff are good, the place seems  always busy. Good for them! Is this place anything different than the same type of places that are in Greensburg, Latrobe, Delmont ect.. no! Why this one is so busy, I am not sure.  IF you want the same food with out the wait go to the other type of place with different names in Greensburg. I can also say that the seating and atmosphere are not very comfortable, and 4.00 bucks for cheese dip is crazy."}
{"text":"I like this place, being Mexican is hard to like a place that serves real Mexican food. In this little nice restaurant they have some good real authentic dishes. I like the ambiance and the prices are very good. The service is great, they are doing a good job!!  The chorizo in sopes and tostadas is one is my favorite things!!"}
{"text":"I live in Pittsburgh, but my boyfriend lives in the Irwin area. One of the most frustrating things about the food scene in Pittsburgh is there are not many good Mexican options. At a lot of places you can tell they are serving a pre-made guacamole mixture that came from a bag, margaritas out of a pre-made jug, etc. This place definitely was NOT one of those places though!    I got a take out order of guacamole and chips along with shrimp chimichangas. The order also came with salsa. I'm not really a salsa person, but it was pretty good nonetheless. The chips were warm, the guacamole was homemade and wonderful! The chimichangas had huge shrimp in them, and even the presentation of them in the takeout container was nice. They were delicious! My only complaint was a minor one - I can never eat my whole meal, and there was so much cheese sauce on these that it made it kind of mushy upon re-heating. But otherwise they were awesome! I'll definitely be back to try some other food as well as a margarita! Awesome addition to the Irwin area! Best Mexican in the area!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. My only complaint was that our waiter never asked if we wanted an alcoholic drink.  We asked for the drink menu after we already ordered soft drinks n he never came back and took our order.  But the desserts were yummy. And the prices were excellent.  We will Definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for Mexican food and being new to the area we saw this place had decent reviews so we gave it a try. We ordered drinks, a margarita and a Long Island ice tea. The margarita was basically a slushy with no alcohol and the ice tea wasn't even mixed when brought to the table. You could visibly see 3 layers. After mixing it, it almost had a taste of a pop base or possibly just too much syrup. Either way neither drinks were consumed. Upon getting our chips and salsa, we ultimately didn't eat the salsa because it tasted more like pasta marinara with a bit of a kick to it than it did salsa. So we kindly asked for guac instead! Definitely a step up, but a bit on the too salty side I couldn't eat as much as I know I could've. We got our food (chicken fajita and pollo chipotle chicken) and my fajitas were enjoyable but there were no tomatoes (as advertised on the menu), a large portion of the onions were barely cooked, and we were not told that EVERY plate on our table was extremely hot. We had to wait several minutes before we could even hold our flour tortillas before filling them. The chipotle sauce on the other dish wasn't poor tasting, but it wasn't a sauce as much as it was a spicy cheese sauce poured on top. The server was polite and the manager saw we didn't drink our drinks so he removed them from our bill, much appreciated. We did however, get charged instead for a Miller lite (which we didn't order). It was rather inexpensive and considering he removed the other drinks we didn't care. We paid and just wanted to go home. My fiancé is still upset about his experience..."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in the east burbs, hands down!  Not saying much for Pittsburgh mind you.  However, the staff is super friendly and the place is very clean.  The enchiladas here are my favorite!!!  Can't go wrong with the enchiladas verdes if you like spicy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants around. Whether ordering take-out or eating in, the service is always super fast and friendly. I have never had anything here that I didn't like. The portions are big and prices reasonable. I really can't add much that someone else hasn't already written.   My only issue is that I really enjoyed their previous location on Route 30, when it was Los Campesinos. I just really like the atmosphere of the place, even if it was a little campy and crowded. The new location is definitely much roomier and has a lot more seating, but I feel like it lost something in the move. Just my personal opinion, I'd still recommend Acapulco to anyone!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken fajitas, they were ok. They didn't have a lot of seasoning. The rice was great though. Loved their queso also. My friends got burritos and loved them. Delicious margarita. I would give them another try, even though my main dish wasn't fantastic."}
{"text":"Wonderful resteraunt, glad to have found it.  I am from Texas and so good Mexican food is apart of Texas heritage. The food made me homesick..."}
{"text":"Used to be really great, but seems to have gone downhill. Salsa this time tasted like they poured tomato sauce in a bowl. Last time order came out wrong twice. We used to love this place."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Service was weird but it worked. Guacamole, didn't like it at all. Queso was really good. Had a burrito combo. Nice place."}
{"text":"I used their take out service. But even for take out they were very friendly and attentive. From order time to walking out was ten minutes! With kids this was awesome.   The one downfall I could not find a menu online. So I had to order when I got there.   Food was GREAT! Chips and salsa are fantastic. We each had the tacos and chicken nachos. It was all good. The chicken was cooked and moist! I will be returning :)"}
{"text":"Was fortunate to find this place in a chain store wasteland area. The chicken enchiladas with spicy mole sauce - \"Chicken Rancheros\"  - came out hot, fresh, and large portioned. Good American and Mexican beer options, drafts are 16 or 27 oz. Service was fast and friendly. Just one pet peeve, they started cleaning up with ammonia well before closing time and with customers still eating.  Don't do that!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. But unfortunately didn't. I understand that this is Western Pa and taste buds are different. But, everything we had lacked flavor. I had a chimichanga, which I asked to be fried. Two came, and they were very small and lightly fried. The cheese sauce had zero flavor to it and the chicken was bland. Also ordered a quesadilla for my child, which was pretty disappointing as well. The only positive was the salsa and that's stretching it."}
{"text":"We love eating here! Everyone is so friendly and they have great prices on food and drinks. It definitely reminds us of our Mexico vacation with real authentic Mexican food. The chips and salsa are so good. They also offer coupons on occasion."}
{"text":"We live less than 5 minutes away and go a couple times a month- they remember us and always bring our toddler a treat! Great service and food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Extremely fast service! The food almost came out one time before I ordered it. I'm not sure if it is authentic Mexican food or not, but I much prefer it over Chili's or Taco Bell. This is one of my favorite places to eat Mexican food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!! The prices are really good and the service is insanely fast! We come here at least once a month. The beef tip quesadilla is amazing."}
{"text":"Great food, good service...... the fajita burrito with shrimp is amazing. The shrimp are huge and the sides are good. The Queso is very good. Definitely a good choice for a Mexican joint in the area"}
{"text":"Exceptional dining experience!  I had the choripollo.  This was the best rendition of it that I have tasted. The chorizo was very good and it wasn't greasy.  Their salsa is very tasty also.  The restaurant was very clean and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I thought the food was good here. For anyone from Harrisburg familiar with Fiesta Mexico or El Rodeo - it's on par with them, if not a little better. They're really good for the price."}
{"text":"I've eaten here and bunch of times and have never had a bad meal. Try the Enchiladas Suizas, Chicken Flautas, or most one of the combination plates. They're all good."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place due to the good reviews but coming here from out of town maybe I was a bit jaded.  For the area this is decent Tex mex but if you've had Tex mex anywhere else you might be a bit disappointed.  First of all, do not get the margarita...it was sickly sweet. Definitely not made fresh and full of syrup/premix. The chicken chile relenos did not use real releno peppers and the peppers were way undercooked. The chicken was very dry and mole sauce was very salty. The best tasting thing here were the dry shrimp my wife got.  Everyone else I was with who were from the area seemed to like the place but if you've had real Tex mex don't get your hopes up."}
