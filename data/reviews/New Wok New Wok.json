{"text":"Tried the sesame chicken and got food poisoning within 30 minutes. My friend warned me that this place gave him food poisoning but i wanted to give it a shot... Never again"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed by the food here. First off they don't have samples and that's already bad enough. The food is a little overpriced, but the chicken taste fine. My huge problem was that the chow mein noddles tasted horrible!! It is honestly one of the most bland, bad tasting food I have ever placed in my mouth. I know what your thinking, how overdramatic! But honestly words can't describe how shitty these noddles taste. I would not at all recommend this place for anyone!!"}
{"text":"Brought my kids here and they split a meal.  Asked for one package but two paper plates and she told me she would have to charge me extra. Wow, no kids combo can order from and they want to charge me extra for a paper plate. Never coming back here. Food was ok according to my kids. Thank you Xia for not charging me for the extra fork."}
{"text":"I think by far this is the worst customer service I've had in a long time. First of all, they were rude. They don't speak English very well and did not explain how everything works. My best friend wanted a three combo (one meat, two sides, and rice or noodles) but instead got only one side and they freaked out on her as if it was her fault. Second of all, the food was disgusting. In Winnipeg, the broccoli have a great sauce, the rice is amazing - you can't stop eating, and the meat is more meat than flour. Here, the broccoli were dry, the rice was tasting like old, burned oil, like they didn't wash their dishes after using it to cook and all the burned made the rice taste like burned, and the meat was only fat covered in 10 layers of flour and tons of sauce. I couldn't get more than four-five bites. I went to them again because I wanted my money back, my friend accompanied me and I was asking nicely if I can get the money back, then she started explaining we need a receipt because otherwise she cannot refund me the money. My friend backed me up by saying 'she was here three minutes ago' and the lady lifted her hand in front of my friend's face and said 'I wasn't talking to you'. And she is the manager of that place... we kept on arguing and in the end she still did not refund the money... seriously, don't buy anything from there."}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if I could. Was looking forward to getting Chinese but I wanted to try an item to make sure something wasn't too spicy for me and was rudely told by an employee\"NO SAMPLES!\"  Their less than a penny sample cost them a customer!"}
{"text":"This is your basic Chinese food offering located in a food court

2 items and rice or noodles for $8

Lots to choose from for meat , chicken or pork but only had veggie tofu or mixed vegtables

They have a daily special as well that saves you some change or if cannot decide

The flavoring is very generic to satisfy everyone so you may wish to grab a packet or two of hot chili sauce

The nice thing about Chinese food is that they have to cook everything from scratch (maybe not the egg rolls which are frozen) so if you are avoiding frozen patties and fries then New Wok is a healthier alternative"}
{"text":"Manchu Wok by another name. Like the noodles. They over do the sweetness a little too much. Service is fast and efficient."}
{"text":"This is one of the better tasting Chinese food court restaurants and I didn't really have any issues with their service."}
{"text":"Go to Thai island right across from this place. Will never come back this place! It's great they have a selection of chicken but, but if you want to sample the chicken they will not allow it. How would I know which chicken I want to order. Shitty service, after i asked for a sample the answer I got was \"it's sweet!\" Ummm really how the hell am I suppose to know if I want it? What kind of customer service is that?"}
