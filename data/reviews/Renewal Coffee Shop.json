{"text":"Stopped in Renewal coffee shop in the rocks the other day. What a surprise!  Twice as good for a third of the price of those other places. (You know the ones). If in the area I suggest giving something new a try. You'll be pleasantly surprised!
P.S.  Grab a muffin or pastry!"}
{"text":"What a gem in the Rocks! So glad Chartiers Ave finally has a place to get crazy good coffee and snacks and FREE WIFI.   I work nearby and I'm loving that I get to come in here to get out of the office while still being productive.  The space feels full of possibility and I highly recommend  setting up shop and caffeinating here!"}
{"text":"Such a great community, driven coffee shop. Excellent coffee and even better service (if that's even possible!!!!)"}
{"text":"I was so excited to visit this coffee shop located in the father Ryan Art Center. The hours of operation on yelp didnt jive with the hours on the website and took a chance but it wasn't open.

A woman inside the center indicated to me that its under new mgmt.  I will check back and update this review when I know more. Father Ryan is a saint.. adore that man."}
{"text":"Love the idea of this coffee shop. It is located inside of the Father Ryan Arts Center. Stopped in Saturday afternoon for tea and I was not disappointed. The owner is super friendly and everything is very inexpensive. All the tea, coffee, and baked goods come from local Pittsburgh companies. Will definitely be back here agajn soon. If you are into supporting local businesses this is definitely your place."}
{"text":"Cool place. Good coffee and excellent wraps.  So far that's all I've tried, but there is a full lunch menu.  Kinda hidden in the back of the library. A great place to grab a book and have a bite. Owner is very attentive."}
{"text":"This place is great! Convienent on Chartiers Ave right by the shopping district. Inside Father Ryan's Center...Parents can get their coffee when they drop their kids off to daycare!!!
