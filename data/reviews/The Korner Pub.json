{"text":"The KP has the best chicken wings going. I love their House Hot wings and find they're the closest thing to the original Buffalo style wings we used to get at Cap's Bar & Grill. 
Their creative specials are always captivating. Enjoyed the grilled chicken breast on a citrus tropical salad yesterday. 
Char does a great job of cultivating a friendly jocular civilized neighbourhood pub atmosphere. Great group of local folk here."}
{"text":"This little gem has kicked it up 1000% since the new owners took over and got rid of the God awful smoking. The craft beer selection is awesome. Great atmosphere and very cozy. Will be nice when they are able to serve a little food, otherwise, if you are a beer lover this is a great neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick beer, the staff was very friendly and the beer was cold. Bar felt very family oriented and the staff knew the customers all by name. It was welcoming and I would recommend stopping by to get a feel for it."}
{"text":"I've seen the nice reviews and have been meaning to visit this bar for a while. I just had a chance to visit and was extremely pleased. This is a small neighborhood style pub and doesn't appear to have a kitchen but they have an excellent selection of draft and bottled beers. I had a Great Divide Grand Yeti imperial stout, which I've had before and really liked. You don't see that beer or beers like it at very many places. It was in tap and served in a 9 ounce glass for $6. 

Prices were reasonable and service very good. I wish I had more time to try a couple more of the beers they had. 

The place is a little larger than it seems from the outside because there's a couple of rooms, one with the bar and another with a pool table. The bar has about ten stools and then there are some tables
In that same room. As a nice little touch they had pretzel sticks available at the bar. 

This is a place I'd definitely come back to, and I'd stop by here all the time if I lived a little closer."}
{"text":"The staff and the craft brew selection is great. With games, dart boards and a pool table, the KP is a great local hangout.

{"text":"The first time I came to KP I was not expecting an expansive list of craft beers on tap, and was so pleasantly surprised! The bartenders are helpful and knowledgeable, and super friendly. There are pretzel sticks to satisfy your salt cravings, and menus on hand if you decide you want to order food from nearby (KP does not have its own kitchen). Also, this bar is beer only - no liquor.

KP is by far my favorite South Hills bar! Give it a shot if you want to spend a chill night playing darts and drinking some really great beer."}
{"text":"The Korner Pub is a delightful little dive with the perfect mix of classic Pittsburgh dive and craft brew haven. 

I grew up near this bar, and remembered the murky smoke-filled spot as somewhere I'd never venture. Since the Korner Pub has come under new ownership and cleared up the smoke, it's been recommended to me by countless South Hills dwellers. 

If you're looking for a laid-back spot to grab a beer, watch the game, or play some pool, this is the place. The draft list is fantastic, with a wide range of crafts brews both local and national. I bugged out when I saw the prices. $13 growler fills? This is officially my new growler filling station. The prices are affordable, and the pub also offers cans and 6 packs to go. The menu also offers pitchers of all the drafts--a welcome choice when you bring a group or plan to stay for awhile. 

If you're not a brew fan, I might not recommend this to you. The spot only offers beer, and there is no food sold here. I'm told you can bring in a meal--which is easy enough with several pizza joints nearby. 

The space is really simple, with a main bar, a dart room, and the pool table in the back. I played a quick game of pool while polishing off a Nitro Mojo IPA. I'm sorry I couldn't stay longer, and made a promise to be back very soon."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars with every expectation it will go to five. This out of the way pub was once a haven for heavy smoking barflys, but new ownership has turned this place into an oasis of craft beers! New tap system, a pool table, dart boards and a rich variety of craft beers is going to mean I will be hanging out here quite a bit! Welcome addition to Mt. Lebanon's pub and dining scene."}
{"text":"Awesome spot with good beer, a pool table, darts, and even board games. Haven't been there when it's busy so service was always top notch."}
{"text":"Nice local pub.  Younger crowd when I was there.  Decent selection of beer-to-go."}
{"text":"If you like craft beers but dont like bars that try too hard to be hipster,  this is a great place. Good beer at the most reasonable price ive seen. Its laid back and welcoming. The only reason i didnt not give it 5 stars is because the lack of parking but it truly is one of my favorite places to have a drink."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to grab some good beer, but don't want the hectic atmosphere of Cain's then the Korner Pub has that.  It is dark, quiet, and offers a really good beer selection.  Nothing much to review here, no food, just a place to sit down and have a couple of beers.  At times, depending on who it is, the employees tend to be a bit immature, but for the most part okay."}
{"text":"Wow I hadn't been in here for almost twenty years and decided to stop while waiting for a bus back to the city.
Back in the day it was a total old man's bar with the occasional twenty something living on the neighborhood. We would primarily stop by for six packs and maybe a beer since my best friend lived around the corner. We joked that prior to that we may have tried to get served there underage lol...oh the 90s.
So stopping for a beer before the bus was nice. Small crowd of locals, hipsters Mt. Lebo style. Limited selection of beers but decent ones. Comparable pricing. Bartender was ok as well.
All in all didn't miss much over the last two decades."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall. There are a lot of options on this street, most that don't look all that promising. This place was in a strip mall and hard to find. 

Food was awesome, we got the wings and fries. We got the pint special, so a free beer with this wasn't a bad deal at all. 

The bartender was a great guy. Might want to speak above a whisper in the future, but not a big deal."}
