{"text":"Authentic, delicious, fast... I picked the pastor tacos.  They come with just the meat and you can put cilantro, onions, lime, and sauces yourself. It makes the ordering easy, especially because my Spanish is minimal. The real deal , go there.

... Oh and they make their own pastries, yup!  Mmmm"}
{"text":"Omg! If you're from CA or know true Latin/Mexican products, this is where you'll find them. I couldn't believe it and the staff is helpful and friendly. The area is pretty sketchy but if you're brave enough, you should find your products. :)"}
{"text":"We finally tired the taco cart here and it was fantastic! Tacos are made in front of you, and didn't take long to make. The toppings bar is incredible with guacamole, cilantro, salsas, and some delish red sauce that really made the taco! Had 1 steak and 1 chicken. The steak was by far my fav! Will definately go back!"}
{"text":"This place is super authentic - don't believe me, because I'm as European as they get - believe my Mexican husband from Palm Springs. According to him, this is exactly what Mexican supermarkets are like in Southern California. It makes him feel more at home since I made him move from the desert to Cleveland, where it's sunny, you know, 7 days a year. 

Back to La Plaza: there's even a jewelry store in there! If you are looking for some sort of Mexican brand or ingredient, you will find it here. The prices for spices, etc is much more reasonable than if you were to buy it elsewhere. Their chorizo is incredible - flavorful and not as greasy as you find in normal supermarkets. On the weekends they have a taco cart in the store."}
{"text":"I had some of the best Mexican food ever here. The carne asada was off the hook and on the weekend you can get menudo. Menudo is the national soup of Mexico and this is the only place in Cleveland you can get it. I think this is a hidden gem for those that want real Mexican food."}
{"text":"Hands down La Plaza is the most authentic Mexican establishment in Cleveland. Delicious prepared foods as well as a huge selection of Mexican and Latin American grocery options. La Plaza now has an outdoor patio for the summer to enjoy their tacos and fajitas at lunch time! Best guac around and salsa that are fresh, flavorful, and authentic as compared to many of the attempts in the Cleveland area. Bonus if you or someone you are with speaks Spanish. Cannot recommend this place more highly for this area if you are looking for authentic Mexican cuisine or ingredients."}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic, melt in your mouth tacos. You can get lengua as a meat option. Delicious condiments including super hot peppers. Bonus that you can pick up fresh guac and chips, mexican beer at the same time."}
{"text":"Excellent array of authentic Mexican groceries. This is a great little shop! If you get a chance try their tacos, they are by far the best tacos I have had in Cleveland! The workers are very nice, and the prices are great! Highly recommend this hidden gem of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Big thumbs up for La Plaza!    Stopped here in the midst of Saturday errands to try out the tacos for lunch.    Fabuloso!   Ay Papi!    

First tidbit of info - pay FIRST at the cashier for what you want if it's too cold for the taco stand to be outside.  $2 bucks a taco ....  I recommend the Al Pastor.   

The supermarket itself is sparkling clean.   I picked up a tub of homemade salsa.   Tasty.

Plenty of parking and right off the Bunts/140th I-90 exit.

Get there!"}
{"text":"When I lived nearby, I did all my grocery shopping here; it's a good shop.
I still come back to pick up guacamole and salsa or the occasional container of pickled carrots- all made in house. 

Fantastic taco cart on Saturdays and Sundays."}
{"text":"Short and sweet.

I've been to Austin ,Texas.
Chicago,Columbus and a few more.
I have to say my hometown Cleveland,Ohio should know that we are truly blessed to 
have an authentic Mexican fare.
Come and enjoy a taste of Mexico."}
{"text":"5 stars - for the prepared foods. B.E.S.T. tacos we have had since moving to Ohio. They're like the taco carts/trucks on each corner under the 7 train along Roosevelt Ave in Queens (NYC). DELICIOUS! Finger licking good! We regularly come to La Plaza, and it never disappoints! We've brought many first timers here, and each time they'll text a few days later, \"Can you send me the name/address of that taco place?\" The tamales are SLAMMIN'! The bakery is on point. (Disclosure - we've never had a cake from here.)

4 stars - for Mexican groceries. I don't cook Mexican food, so my assessment may not be accurate. But it \"looks\" like it'd have every ingredient needed/wanted. We definitely pick up a few \"novelty\" groceries each time we come. 

4 stars - for the produce - the variety is fresh and varied, but limited. I can pick up specific items but have never been able to only shop here for all my week's produce needs. When I buy produce here, its only as a supplement for specific dishes."}
{"text":"Thank you Lord!!! Having lived in Oklahoma
City and Washington state, where authentic taco trucks abound, then coming back to Cleveland to find little, to no food trucks, was a sad reality! 

These are REAL tacos! If you've never had an authentic taco, do yourself a favor and head over to La Plaza and order some! We will definitely be back A LOT!"}
{"text":"I lived out in San Diego for a while and this super market has the most authentic tacos and burritos I've had since leaving California."}
{"text":"Fuck Barrio, and fuck Chipotle. If you want legit tacos, you come here. For 2$ each you do indeed get a generous portion of your choice of meat cooked to order on the best tasting tortilla. First time, I had no idea where to start, so I got the carne asada and the barbacoa. Both great, but the barbacoa blew my mind, soooo good. The topping station isn't overwhelming, it's perfect. Onions and whatever sauce. I have no clue what they were, maybe someone should figure it out. Whatever the orange one is was the best, and the red. Pretty damn good with some rice. Going back for more."}
{"text":"I love this store. It's very Mexico. 

Hot bar prepared food section is a must!! Real tacos. One of the only places you can pay a telephone bill ,get a taco,do some grocery shopping and go to buy a statue of the Virgin Mary or buy/pawn gold. 

Fun staff. Clean."}
{"text":"Fairly clean, fairly orderly, fairly good selection -- and if we stopped there, it would be just, only fair.  People defintely make the difference here -- all but one fully conversant in English and knowledgeable about mainly Mexican food experiences.  The one who wasn't was behind the butcher counter, but another exployee translated for him!  Fresh pastries, decent produce section, even a \"We Buy Gold\" jewelry store inside."}
{"text":"The tacos here are very good. Not as good as Mi Pueblo's but they went under, so the Westside has a new taco champ. Bummer though no chix - egg or piccadilo for your filling choice. Tortas (sandwich) very good also. Some  of the meats are greasy so a take home burrito leaves plenty of grease in the container & on the tortilla yuk!!!! This isn't an issue with Tortas or tacos. Good grocery shop for Mexican food too. They now have shredded chix as a filling.They now have chix.I've lower my rating from 4 to 2. Meats are dry too often. Haven't been here in months ( I work near by) Not worth it.Wait,the Horchata is GREAT(its a drink) go for that. Prices went up $3 a taco & I don't think they're worth that much. The dry meats & higher price turned me off."}
{"text":"Great market for Latinos trying to cook with great ingredients. I had to drive 40 minutes to stock up. The Taco stand outside is the best in the Cleveland area. The Taco de Pollo is hands down the best. Moist chicken with toppings of cilantro and onions and your choice of sauces. I love the avocado cream sauce. The woman before me said it bangs, and she was right!

The carne asada taco was very good. They cube it up pretty small which I don't prefer. But the flavor was very good. At $2.50 a taco, you can go wrong."}
{"text":"I've been in Cleveland for 5 years coming from Los Angeles! I can't believe it's taken me this long to find La Plaza. Their tacos are Authentic. Currently they don't offer chicken so I had to get beef. I was told they are thinking of offering chicken due to demand. Even though they are limited on what they serve I'm giving 5 stars because the Asada Tacos & Rice I did get had great flavor, exactly what I'm used to. I am so excited, the visit made my day & put a huge smile on my face!"}
{"text":"I try to get to La Plaza at least once a week. I used to shop at the store next to Mi Pueblo but it seems that complex has run its course. I was lucky enough to find La Plaza. First off it may be one of the cleanest and well organized grocery
stores I have been to. The dried spices are priced very well. The types of salsa available are quite amazing. There are two of the tomatillo variety and two of the tomato based. The al pastor and chorizo from the butcher are a real treat. Now the best part. Back in the corner you can order tacos, tortas as well as a few more things. I opt for the al pastor tortas.  Prepared with house made bakery rolls and sliced, marinated pork. Get it with everything- includes cheese, lettuce, tomato, sour cream and refried beans. There is also a condiment bar right there that includes a variety of salsas, cilantro, lime wedges and diced onion. Be sure to get a bag of fresh made chips and salsa to accompany quite possible the best sandwich in CLE."}
{"text":"This place makes me feel absolutely ridiculous for going to El Carnicero, Barrio or Momocho for tacos.  La Plaza's are the only tacos I've had in Cleveland that are heavy on flavor and light on pretense.  I had the al pastor and chorizo tacos from El Carnicero a week ago and I had the same from La Plaza today and it honestly made me laugh.  El Carnicero, and by proxy Momocho, doesn't even come close.  These restaurants, like many in Cleveland, simply gild marginal food with micro greens and bullshit so they can charge the lemming-like Cleveland foodies as much as they please.  If you're not a \"foodie\" (groupie moron) and you want a good taco, come to La Plaza.  Get some chicarrones and tamales while you're there."}
{"text":"If you want authentic tacos go to the deli in the back of the market. If you want authentic horchata, (albeit a bit too sweet) go to the deli in the back. If you want atmosphere go somewhere else ... although I have no clue where you'd find home cooking like this anywhere in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Coming from Arizona where quality Mexican food is only a few blocks away in any direction, I can say finding this place was a blessing. Thank you for everything. Their meat selection is amazing. Also, check out their produce. It's of very high quality. 

Pros: Everything

Cons: it's a 25 minute drive for me."}
{"text":"Really authentic tacos and very nice people. I see myself coming back many many times. I tried them all and they were all delicious. The price is perfect. There was no sitting area but it is your typical mexican street food. This is my first time and I was in a rush but I will see the actual grocery store next time I go."}
{"text":"Simply put:  This is the best Mexican food in Cleveland!  It's original, inexpensive, friendly, and unique.  Pay your tab at the front of the store's customer service window, then give your receipt to one of the wonderful women in the back.  Tacos, tamales, rice and beans, specials at night (taco service ends at 6 pm), lots of choices of meats.  I don't think I'll eat at any other Mexican place in Cleveland.  THIS IS A MUST VISIT!"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to visit this place.  Was happily surprised to see they were making and serving their tacos outside on a small patio space.  Very inexpensive and really good.  They even had homemade horchada."}
{"text":"I can't even think of what to say...TACOS.

This grocery store has all kinds of Mexican products, so our routine here is to go in and get some Coca Cola in glass bottles and pre-pay for our tacos inside. (This is a good option to keep in mind for those of you that don't often have cash in pocket.) Then we head out to the sidewalk taco cart and hop in line. And, yes, the line is pretty much always there, even if it's just one person in front of you. They offer a few kinds of tacos: barbacoa, el pastor, la lengua, chorizo, carnitas. I've only ever had the barbacoa and el pastor and they are phenomenal. While one guy takes your order and gets the meat heated ready for the tacos, another gets the double corn tortillas heated and slightly crisped on another griddle to the side. The barbacoa was a little dry and not so amazing the first time I came, but the second time, it had a perfect crisp on the edges of the meat and the flavor was on point. El pastor is just...amazing. I don't eat pork, but I love this stuff. The flavor of the marinade is perfect. Once you get your tacos, you head over to the cash register and pay (or hand over your receipt from inside) and start dressing the meat with things like cilantro, onions, lime wedges, and a variety of at least 6 different sauces and salsas. 

Since this is a grocery store primarily, there are only a couple of benches outside to sit on while you eat your food, but I think most people head to their cars to hide their shameful eating technique: inhaling the food like an animal and moaning over the taco perfection that came and went so quickly. 

If you like tacos even a little bit, you have to come here. Life changing."}
{"text":"OMG!  I haven't had authentic barbacoa taco's like these since I was a kid growing up in Houston, TX, south side.  It brought back memories when I remember on Sunday mornings my dad would get a basket of barbacoa and corn tortillas from the local Mercado.  So tender and flavorful.  These are authentic Mexican street tacos. If you're in the area, you should stop and have two, or three, or four.  I think I stopped at four?"}
{"text":"How do I love thee (La Plaza)? Let me count the ways. 

1. Tacos. Oh, the tacos. 
2. Freshly made salsa roja, salsa verde, guacamole, etc. for purchase. The salsas are excellent and not afraid of heat. Brave salsa! 
3. Awesome baked goods (bread is $0.75). 
4. Full butcher.  Meat-alicious.  
5. Mystery junk food and candy that is irresistible (disclaimer: only mysterious if you don't speak espanol, like me). 
6. Bonus jewelry counter. 

I've been annoyed for years that Columbus has a plenitude of authentic taco trucks and Clevelanders are forced to survive without. Perennially disappointing sports franchises AND no taco trucks? How much more can we take, I ask! How much more?? 

I have a pretty hard crush on the tacos at La Plaza Supermarket. I'm partial to the chorizo tacos and al pastor. Load those bad boys up with cilantro, onions and fresh squeezed lime and decide to learn Spanish because they're so delicious and you never want anything to come between you and your tacos again. The tacos come in doubled up warm, soft, dreamy grilled corn tortillas. $2/taco.  The tacos are so simple, but so full of flavor. 

You can get the tacos and/or other prepared hot foods back at the deli area (or on the taco cart, if applicable). Pay at the register first and then go back and put in your order. then wander around wanting to buy stuff because it looks interesting even though you know better. 

There's also lots of great items in the store to buy/try for adventurous (or even mildly daring) home cooks. 

Near the highway. Easy to get in/out. Decent sized parking lot. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I recommend EVERYTHING. The tacos and tortas are phenomenal. The right flavors, portion sizes and prices. An incredible restaurant (and grocery store). We left with bags of goodies; with a lot of items that we aren't able to find anywhere else."}
{"text":"Dios mio...This place is awesome.  My boss came into work raving about the salsas and guacamole she bought here.  Being a sucker for good Mex, I had to make the trip to La Plaza.  The store isn't nice by any means but here comes the good part:  Robert.  Robert is the \"front man\" of the freshly prepared foods.  He gregariously introduced himself to me, plated up some yummy mole and pork chile and invited me to try the food.  Well, it was delicious.  I wanted one of everything.  He said they go to Chicago on Thursdays so the best days to visit La Plaza are Friday, Saturday, and Sundays.  They even sell El Milagro tortillas.  When I lived in Chicago I religiously bought these--they are the best.  When you stop in, meet Robert.  Super great guy and he'll give you a behind-the-ropes experience at La Plaza.  One word:  TACOS!  The taco cart outside is a MUST DO.  Double-layered, warm corn tortillas, fresh cilantro, fresh onion, and any meat from chicken, barbacoa, carnitas, carne asada, and some veggie mix.  Downright delicious.  Any only $2 per taco.  And with their house made salsa.  My gosh I need to stop talking about it.  I am going to go again tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I stopped by the other day and got some pork tamales-  I liked them.  -better than the rajas tamales.  The pork was shredded and the shell was flavorful.  I bought some store made salsa too.  It had no label, just a price of $3.95 for a half a pint.  Holy S#%+!  It was hot!!.  It had pieces of avocado and cilantro in it and was watery, not chunky-  a good salsa is watery, not chunky.  Pico De Gallo is chunky, not watery.  I liked it \"a lot!\"  I'm considering giving another star...

Been there a couple of times now.  I had the Al Pastor Tacos my first time.  They were pretty good.  Not great.  I was disappointed in the lack of condiments.  They did have some roasted jalapeños sitting out that were good, but I want the works on my street taco- salsas, lime, cilantro, onion.  Even on a cart in Mexico, you get the works.  They had almost nothing.
This time I got tamales and chicharrones gorditas, (that's the pork rinds with meat and fat still attached.).  The tamales were ok but, again, disappointing.  They didn't roast the meat down- it was cubed pork loin.  It should have been shredded pork butt.  I assume they cubed the pork to save time.  This is also why I didn't think the tacos on my previous visit were good, because the pork wasn't roasted, it was sautéed.  It should have been marinated pork butt sliced off a rotisserie. They just cut up some pork and cooked it in a pan with tomato sauce and pineapple- again, short cuts to save time.
The chicharrones were pretty good, but already stale from sitting and I thought they were too dry besides- no fat content.
All in all, still better than your average MexAmerican restaurant with \"Loco\" in the title somewhere."}
{"text":"Did you know that La Plaza is Spanish for \"The Plaza\"?  Now you do!  I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, but every now and then I like a good taco.  This place opened up a while ago, after two previous grocery stores tried and failed to be successful there.  This place, I have a feeling, may stick around.  

It's not a great location for a supermarket, being hidden away in an odd commercial district of Lakewood Heights Blvd., and the parking lot is tiny, but then I've never seen it crowded either.  

I needed some groceries and this place is right by where I lived, so I went there for the first time recently.  I'm no expert, but their selection of Mexican and south american grocery items seems pretty comprehensive.  There's more stuff there than I know what it is.  

The staff are all friendly, all speak Spanish, and everyone I dealt with was conversant in English as well, and there is nothing about the place that seems fake or inauthentic, if you care about that sort of thing.

I happened to be shopping on a weekend day, and there was a small stand outside that was selling food. On my way out I bought a taco, just to try it, and I'm immediately hooked.  OMG this is THE best taco I've had since the former cook at El Tango Taqueria on Madison quit several years ago.  This one isn't quite as great, by comparison, but it is definitely right there in my top two, and my #1 can't be obtained any longer, so this is the current reigning champ when it comes to tacos.  And I can walk there in minutes.  Fuck yeah.

I don't want this place to ever go out of business now, so every weekend I'm going to go there and order as many tacos as I can stuff in me."}
{"text":"The al pastor tacos are what the gods would have eaten in Norse mythology if they had any taste at all. 
Haven't tried pastor on any other meat delivery method, but I'm pretty sure they do burritos and maybe tortas now. 
But really, why mess with something so perfect? Tortilla, meat, onion, lime. Done. 

Added bonus, you can stroll around after stuffing yourself and make a grocery list of things that look good but you'll probably forget about until the next time you stuff your face."}
{"text":"This place is great. Fast and delicious tacos. Really nice staff. Got three tacos in less than a minute from the patio grill. 

Really tender pastor. Full of flavor. All the right toppings too."}
{"text":"Well Jason stole my My Holey Guacamole!

YES! lucky me, another awesome food place near LAKEWOOD!

What can I say, I moved here from San Diego about 10 years ago( don't ask) and was devestated at not being able to find REAL Mexican ingredients. First I was lucky enough to stumble upon Mi Pueblo, then I found their THEN tiny store...flash forward to 2011. HOLY Carne ASADA Bumblebee man!

This is a Mexican grocery on steroids! I am so happy! I can buy all the stuff I normally bought, PLUS they have the prepared foods, salsas, Pico De gallo, Carnitas and to mention again the fantastic little Taco stand that is open during the weekend. 

This one man show has had many a long wait for the tasty morsels divined off the griddle and into propperly double wrapped, cilantro and onion topped tacos of happiness...Tripe, carne, adabado, al pastor, barbacoa and chorizo are usually available as well as their green and red salsa which are nothing like Chi Chi's or Chipotle...last time I was there they also had grilled spring onions you could add on the side...

The meat counter is great. No funny \"embalmed\" meats like you find at Giant Eagle plumped up with that nasty salt solution everyone is putting in their meat. real pure meats, fresh and marinated.. They have a little sample table where you can experience the yummy salsas, Pico de Gallo, ceviche and guacamole. They put out their own house made chips which ARE worth buy. Better than ANYTHING made by Frito Lay....

The selections of sauces and condiments is fabulous.

The produce is pretty good, I haven't bought much yet so I cannot really say. I think I bought green onions and cilantro and a carrot probably the size of Congressman Weiner's \"package\" LOL!.

What I liked was the open bins with the different kinds of dried peppers and beans and the fact they have real white corn tortillas that I was used to buying back in San Diego...


I go here about 2-3 times a week.

absolutely make sure you go on the weekend so you can get a taco!!"}
{"text":"Unassuming Mexican market with a hell of a taco! I live down the street and always see the guys lined up outside at the taco cart. Hopped on yelp to see what all the buzz was about. I was not disappointed! Perfectly cooked well seasoned meat grilled in front of you and nuzzled into homemade tortillas. Sprinkle with onion and cilantro and go for the orange sauce. It's like a chipolte ranch or something. It's killer. I loved being able to walk there grab tacos for an OK price and stuff my face with them on the walk home. I think $1.50 for a taco would be a bit more reasonable that $2 but overall a good experience. Would happily go back."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! This is a grocery store with a back corner that serves food. They have tacos, quesadillas, burritos & soup. Tacos were fantastic- chorizo was hands down the best. Very fresh. Not a bad deal for $3.50/taco! Definitely try it for a quick bite!!"}
{"text":"They have the best tacos I've had besides in Mexico of course!! The freshest ingredients used. That is what impressed me the most. The toppings are self serve and they always look like they were just made, shredded, etc. highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"A great place to buy any ingredients to make Foods that are indigenous to the Hispanic Culture.  All items are imported.  They have a plethora of items to choose from including fresh produce, frozen foods, staples, art, clothing and the like!  They even have a restaurant inside where you can get homemade tacos for $2.50!  Guacamole is to die for!  Churizzos were flavourful!!  Need some imported spices then come here to buy!  Moderate prices!"}
{"text":"Thanks PW! I never knew this place existed until my addiction for authentic Mexican tacos was causing me to grief and lash out like a true crack addict. 

The tacos alone are worth a trip every week. I been coming back once a week for a quick order of the tacos. Literally... crack. It's f-ing good. A few other items I love to get here is the homemade tamales and super cheap, super good salsa and guacamole. Takes me back home where the authentic Mexican cuisine doesn't have to come from a fancy restaurant, but from the back of a food truck or marketplace."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent Mexican market, but they have really gone downhill over the years.  I try to stop by at least once a month to get my staple foods but it seems like the quality is lacking.  I always try to grab fresh salsas but the last few times i have bought them and gotten home and you can tell they are expired and been on the shelf to long cause they are almost fizzy which means they are starting to ferment from age.  They put them in takeout plastic containers with snap lids with no date stickers so it's impossible to tell how old they are. Also the salsas have gotten way too spicy.  I mean like super hot.  I brought a friend to try to impress them because I raved about their salsas and he actually bought one and told me he threw it away at home because it was so hot he couldnt eat it.  Everytime I go in it seems like the fresh made tortilla chips are sold out.  Maybe 1 in 5 times i will get lucky and get a bag.  I will not buy their pastries because one time in mid summer there were ants everywhere crawling all over all the bread and pastry, really turned me off to their cleanliness of the whole store.  I really do love the food counter for tacos and hot food but I kinda feel like they can clean up the place and try to keep things fresh and get rid of older food on shelves."}
{"text":"Been coming here for lunch at least weekly for almost six months now. 

They raised their prices this summer to $2.50/taco which is still a great deal. 

Typically I get 3 tacos (barbaco or al pastor) and a large elote cup - corn with cheese, butter, chili powder, other spices. For under $10 you have a meal that's extremely filling and delicious. 

What needs to be said that hasn't already been covered? Great salsa bar with fresh salsa, grilled peppers or leeks, limes, onions, cilantro etc. Lots of pop options, grocery items etc. 

Cash only for the takeaway per the sign but you can order and pay at the grocery registers - much easier to just have a few dollars on hand."}
{"text":"I am constantly on the hunt to find the perfect taco. La Plaza is near perfect. The thing that separates La Plaza from all the other tacos is the shell. It's something about the crispness that puts this place at the top of my list"}
{"text":"Very good tacos and tortas! We can find anything to cook our traditional food here, we love la plaza, I can find chile candies and I loooove it!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this authentic Hispanic haven.  Can't beat the chorizo and marinated chicken fajita. They now have an in store deli! 
Their churros are w-o-n-d-e-r-f-u-l.....they sell out fast and I've missed them a few times."}
{"text":"The taco stand offers the best, most authentic, tacos in Cleveland. Period. In colder months you can get tacos inside of the supermarket. This place is awesome. Highly recommend.

The grocery store is also pretty sweet too. We always buy spices, tortillas, and produce (including cacti!)"}
{"text":"Authentic to its truest form. Everything about this place is amazing if you like Authentic Mexican cuisine. The grocery store itself has tons a fresh produce to pick from. The bakery has fresh baked goods that all looked great, I would suggest picking one for .85 cents at random and you'll most likely come out liking it, plus they are enormous in size. But the absolutely best thing is the hot food section. The tacos look great but taste even better. At only $2.50 a piece! So for my fellow taco enthusiast out there add this to the list to check out"}
{"text":"My stylist recommended this to me on Saturday, telling me that the last time she was at El Carnicero she asked the bartender how they make their chili lime salt for their margaritas.  As such, it comes from La Plaza so I decided to go there on Saturday as a lover of all places Spanish speaking.  My boyfriend and I came home with groceries and 3 tacos a piece from their outside taco stand.  We got a tub of pico de gallo and guacamole - we cleaned the guacamole container in a couple of hours :(  It's probably my favorite secret place so far in Cleveland, plus an added bonus that I can practice my Spanish there.  Very happy with this discovery and can't wait for a return trip..."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but I am SO SO SO happy to have found this place that I have to! I love going to random ethnic grocery stores and walking down all the aisles and poking at things, wondering how I can prepare it at home.

Turns out, this place is AWESOME for that! The employees are all so helpful and nice. I looked at the spices section, trying to figure out how I can make a certain side dish and an employee came up and started helping me. Then later, I grabbed some marinated meats and the butcher was incredibly friendly. The prices are pretty cheap too--I've gone to Trader Joe's and the prices are 75-100% higher (I know TJ's isn't \"authentic\" but bear with me, I hadn't found a Hispanic market in Cleveland before today). I headed over to the taco section. The woman helping me was so friendly. It was next to the bakery section and I've never seen some of those pastries before. I asked her to tell me what everything was and she stepped away from the taco counter and told me. So. Nice.

I bought quite a lot of groceries for one person so I doubt I'll be back in the next week, but I definitely will be back ASAP."}
{"text":"La Plaza, you are so wonderful, how did I not know you were here for years?

After living in Chicago for many moons and doing most of my grocery shopping at a little Hispanic grocery, I was remiss to move to the CLE and leave my fine selection of Mexican food items.  Enter La Plaza!

For years I've searched for the perfect tortilla chip and salsa to be disappointed time and again.  Upon my first entry to La Plaza low and behold were my favorite Chicago brand chips!  And to my pleasant surprise were prepared salsas waiting for me to buy and try!  The salsas are fresh and have a kick!  There are three kinds, pico, red, and green.  I've enjoyed all of them.

In the back of the store is a taco counter.  I haven't purchased any but oh my do they smell delicious!  

The produce section is limited, but does offer some findings you'll not have anywhere else.  Nopales and yucca are among a few of those noted here at La Plaza.

If you're a fan of Tex Mex, Mex, South American, and Hispanic foods, you'll feel nicely at home here."}
{"text":"These tacos are AMAZING. My friend is from Mexico and he introduced us to this place. I love getting a different selection every time I come. The enchiladas and quesadillas are delicious too. The staff is always friendly and the service is quick. Highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"This is it everyone. It's the most authentic Mexican tacos I've had here in Cleveland. In the summer, you can find the taco cart out in front of this Mexican grocery store. They have 5 different types of meat and I have to say that my favorite is the Barbacoa - juicy fatty pork freshly heated up on the grill. Follow up favorites are the chorizo and al pastor.They also have some legit peppers on the side.

I wish they had a bigger salsa bar with the hot hot stuff, but they offer onions, cilantro, and a few different salsas.

This is our go to if we want some tacos. Those other places just don't have this kind of flavor!!!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I read a superb review of la plaza and couldn't stop thinking about it. I couldn't get the image of authentic tacos out of my head, so by the weekend, I had to go there. 
Maybe one of the best decisions of my life- okay that's an exaggeration- but these tacos are everything I wanted and so much more. I've been to Mexico many times and have had amazing food- and these were on par. 
I was not expecting la plaza to be such an expansive grocery. They have aisles upon aisles of authentic Mexican fare. Stuff you would probably have a hard time finding elsewhere. I'd love to say I looked around more, but I was on a one track taco mission, glancing briefly at the snacks and cans and fresh produce, heading straight to the back of the store. 
There is the holy grail, a small lunch counter where they're grilling up meats of all kinds for some authentic taco lovin. I'm going to be honest, we went a little crazy. Tacos el pastor, chorizo, carnitas, wrapped in double fresh tortillas, we ordered them all. They come \"naked\" so you're able to dress them up with the topping you'd like at the little cart right next to the counter. I'm a traditionalist so I dressed mine with onions, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime, but they also had some salsas you could use as well. 
If you couldn't already tell by the enthusiasm, they were delicious. Every single one was awesome. The chorizo was my favorite, but I would happily order any of them again. Do yourself a favor and wash them down with a Mexican coke. 
What came next I can only describe as post taco euphoria. We decided to take this flavor party home with us and bought everything. Homemade chips, corn tortillas, tamales, house made guacamole and fresh salad. We stopped by the butcher counter and got marinated meat to cook at home. We got thres leche out of the bakery fridge. Oh and why not some Mexican beer. 
I think we ate Mexican for the next four days. But I do not regret one single minute of it. Everything we bought was of great quality and equally great taste. 
I consider myself lucky for finding this spot. Just writing this review has me craving some chorizo tacos."}
{"text":"Droppin' some stars, unfortunately. I always recommend La Plaza because their food is delicious and authentic, and as you can see from my check ins, I enjoy coming here! The past couple of times (including today's visit) the store was in shambles (dirty dining areas, trash receptacles, etc) and the taco area was equally messy, missing salsas and running low on most of the topping choices. Also unavailable was the horchata, which was a bummer because I had been totally craving it all day. Both my mom and I agreed that we didn't leave here as content and happy as previous visits. I'm sure I'll be back, but La Plaza needs to really work on professionalism, consistency, and efficiency when it comes to ordering, cleaning, and keeping products stocked."}
{"text":"Finally have had the tacos and other amazing goodies here. Today, we had (in addition to our tacos) a pork dish in this amazing green sauce. We kept making yummy noises as we ate. I love that I can also get a nice tamarind soda. 

Our timing was perfect. Just as we had received our order and had sat down, the line of people had suddenly grown huge. I'd have easily waited in that line. 

I've become a lot more adventurous with trying other grocery options. I've yet to be disappointed. My daughter pointed out the dairy case where she and her husband always pick up an El Salvadoran cream mixture. It's incredible. I also love the fresh pork rinds."}
{"text":"We discovered this Authentic Mexican Market a few years ago when our kids came out for Christmas and we wanted to make Tamales like we did when we lived in California.  Everything we get here is great and the help in the back hot foods and meat dept. are really good.  BUT the Big turn off today was the cashier up front....she was talking to another employee the whole time she was checking everyone out, not once did she say \"Hi\"or \"Thank you\"....heck she didn't even tell me my total, she just put her hand out for money, until she noticed I was just staring at her waiting for my total, yes I know I could read it on the register but I felt she was SO Rude.... I am very used to people speaking Spanish, I don't have a problem with that it's just if you are working with customers treat them like you want them to come back!!"}
{"text":"Rice and beans were great. Ordered the quesadilla, it was giant flour tortilla with slices of muenster cheese dripping of grease. Disgusting"}
{"text":"La Plaza is taco heaven. During the summer they have the taco stand outside on certain days, but you can generally find it inside of the supermarket towards the back by the deli area. They serve authentic Mexican tacos and have a variety of meat selections for you to choose from. Some people miss it, but they also have a small area for you to add toppings right by the side of cashier. Definitely the place to go for some quick, delicious tacos."}
{"text":"Love this store. Love the al pastor. A torta from here is better then any other sandwhich in Lakewood. Al pastor is my favorite. A real gem."}
{"text":"Cool Latin American grocery store that has the best taco bargin in North East Ohio! I've been wanting to stop in and check out the store for several years and now I'm wishing i would have come sooner for lunch. Ordered two tacos to go, one chicken and a chirzo that only totaled $5.00, I've paid more for 1 taco of far less quality. Both tacos tasted great and i was suprised how much filling the ladies behind the counter were able to put into these delights. Looking forward to my next visit and spending time checking out the groceries and other product for sale."}
{"text":"Wow. So far the only place in Cleveland that I could find authentic Tijuana style tacos!!! Although not perfect, I still want to give five stars for the rarity of this. As someone from San Diego, I really miss the supermarkets like Northgate and the taquerias everywhere. 

Double layered corn tortillas. Great, although they did come out of a bag and were not fresh made in house. Although my favorite kind of taco is adobada, I truly felt that the strong suit of La Plaza supermarket tacos was their pollo and barbacoa. Soooo good. The adobada and the asada was still good though. No radish in the toppings bar, or pickled vegetables. I did not try the chorizo taco. 

I'm so upset that they don't have horchata available except on weekends!! I was really looking forward to horchata but I will have to come back on a weekend. 

I was hoping that the taqueria would have elites, but they have corn cups. I would not recommend these. However, for $1.50 you do get quite a large serving. The corn is definitely canned, and it was very heavily buttered. They did top it with queso fresco though. If anyone knows where I can find elotes in Cleveland lmk!

Overall, I highly recommend the tacos here. It cost me $10 for 4 tacos. Not bad. And they were very tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, quesadillas, horchata and other items, served fresh and quick.  Condiment station is nice (as every other review confirms).  Pay cash in the back; cards must go up front with receipt."}
{"text":"Great grocery store and even better food. Also, it's not cash only. I've paid for the tacos up front while they make them. If you're looking for authentic tacos and Mexican food, this is your spot."}
{"text":"I didn't actually get to eat their food because after standing there for 20 minutes they still didn't serve us. Just stood there waiting while they asked other customers what they wanted and talked to each other..."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos cheap and the best fresh salsa I've ever bought. It's in the refrigerated section. I'll never buy salsa from a jar ever again."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with a to go order.  It was delish!  Will have to go back and check it out myself!"}
{"text":"Being from New Mexico has made me a snob when it comes to Mexican food.  This. Place. Is. Amazing!!!  I could eat 100 of these tacos they're so good."}
{"text":"The tacos here are fantastic. Authentic mexican definitely recommend to anyone wanting legit mexican tacos!!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem

Best Taco: Al Pastor

Cash Only

The right amount of shady

Very affordable

Muy bien"}
{"text":"I am perpetually on a hunt for all things Mexican, unfortunately our quest does not stop here. It's a decent enough store but it was low on variety and product. The search goes on.

My Mexican sister-in-law and I drove to Cleveland to stock up on Mexican spices, pan dulce (sweet bread), and other Mexican treats. Walking in the store, it smells like Mexico, it made us feel right at home. It was so nice to see brown people, as my nephews call other Mexicans. We live in Canton, which is low on brown. :)

We arrived around 1 p.m. on Thursday and the deli counters were very empty. The seafood was completely empty. The red meat counter only had a few items in it and the chicken area had the most variety. It was nice to see familiar cuts - like adobo and flattened chicken breasts.

Everything else was just ok. I wanted to get some sangria and could only find one brand, which isn't even the most popular. I want Sangria Senorial, which most places also carry in diet. 

We also wanted specific Mexican candy that is also very popular (Pelon) and authentic Mexican vanilla. They had neither. We did get cajeta, which makes us happy.

I don't know what people are talking about with a taco stand. The restaurant is now separate from the store, maybe its only on weekends or every other tuesday when its sunny and warm, no idea. They had deli food in the back but it was just your basic chicken and potato taquitos. They do however have the jewelry store so pick up some beans and an engagement ring.

So overall this store isn't bad, just isn't great. It doesn't carry much more than the super Walmart near my house in Mexican products. No need to drive all the way up there again to go."}
{"text":"Great fresh prepared foods, great groceries and GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!  I have been a fan of La Plaza as a specialty supermarket for years.  Today I discovered that they use Skip The Dishes and GrubHub to offer delivery for their freshly prepared foods.  My coworkers and I ordered lunch through GrubHub.  When GrubHub messed up our order, I called La Plaza and soon after someone from the store delivered fresh, hot food that had been missing from my order.  They did this even after GrubHub had issued a refund for the missing item!  Next time I'll use Skip The Dishes to order La Plaza delivery for lunch at work!"}
{"text":"I live technically across the street from la plaza and never tried their tacos until I decided to give them a shot today and oh boy was I impressed!! I got two tacos one pollo one al pastor and they were both amazing! The seasoning hits the spot and you can add your own toppings! The portion was very generous too! I only wish I tried them out sooner"}
{"text":"It's really good food and very authentic tacos and food there... The only problem is it you don't speak Spanish (I don't) it's slightly challenging to communicate...but if that's the worst of your problems for the day, I'd say your having a pretty good day."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pastimes is going to a grocery store and going up and down every aisle. I surprise myself that no matter how many cook books, food magazines, cooking shows, or food demonstrations I manage to cover, I find things I never knew existed let alone know what to do with them. The aisles of specialty stores fascinate me most. 

On my visits to La Plaza I see things that I have rarely seen elsewhere in such variety or quality. Bundles of dried herbs, Mexican green onions, lean spiced meats ready to cook, prepared foods and salsas, frozen arepas, bakery and breads, etc. etc. etc. 

I have been to larger Mexican stores in southern California but their meats were as much fat and gristle as meat. Not here. You do not need to buy extra to make up for the waste. This is a clean and well stocked grocery store. I am not sure what a previous reviewer meant by a Mexican themed store. There is no Disneyesque theme here. It is Mexican, pure and simple with a nod to other latin foods.

I find that on weekends there is a greater variety as well as the taco and beverage stands. I like the chili grind beef but have not found it on weekdays."}
{"text":"La Plaza might just have the best authentic Mexican tacos. I didn't even realize that this supermarket had a great lunch spot back in the corner of the store until someone told me how good their tacos were, so I had to check it out for myself. My fiance and I had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon right around 12:00pm. It wasn't crowded when we got in line, but as soon as we sat down the line of people waiting to order was getting long. I had three tacos one each of barbacoa, carnitas and chorizo. He had a steak taco and a carnitas burrito. The food was delicious. It was made right in front of us and done quickly. The best part was the salsa and taco toppings bar that included 4 or 5 different spicy salsas and sauces, onions, limes, radishes and cilantro. 

Tacos were $2.50, burritos $7, and they also had tortas and quesadillas which were also cheap. 

They only have a couple of tables so I would suggest getting there early for lunch. I forgot to ask how late they stay open, but I have a feeling they are only serving for lunch."}
{"text":"I finally got to Go to LA Plaza TODAY!!!! YUM YUM--I did some grocery shopping--Fresh Pepers of every kind - Authentic Fresh foods and good prices!  Like the Fresh Large bunch of Cilantro for .99--The Nice people  work there add to this Gem of a Market!!! NOW The Tacos and Burrito I ordered!  WOW SO WONDERFUL!!! All cooked by this Smiling Friendly Women--She showed me the condiment bar and Believe me--WE Will Keep Telling Everyone about this place and Come Back --I loved the Chorizzo Taco's and my Son his Chorizzo Burrito!!!  Just Go and Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The tacos al pastor are so amazing, just add some onions and cilantro, a squirt of lime and a salsa of your choice and you have yourself the best taco in Cleveland. I want to try the other meats but I just can't separate myself from the al pastor. 

In addition to the great tacos, the store offers nearly everything you need for authentic Mexican cooking. They also have Peruvian ingredients that you can't find in many places. The meat section is full of so many different cuts of meat, but I have not bought any (yet). 

La Plaza is one of the best places in Cleveland for both shopping and eating, if I lived closer I would be there at least once a week!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here tonight and we rolled up into the La Plaza parking lot and all she could say was \"trust me I know it doesn't look like much but you will love their tacos\". And she certainly wasn't lying. This place is as Authentic as it can get in North East Ohio. I got tacos, my galpal got a Tosta and we both got Elote in a cup. And all was well in the world and our stomachs. My biggest regret was I didn't get something sweet after, but I was full so it was my own fault. 10/10 would go again. Check it out."}
{"text":"Coming from south Texas and having lived in Mexico; I have been searching Ohio and PA for good Mexican food and can honestly say this is the only place with great authentic Mexican food in Ohio or PA!
They have amazing food and friendly staff!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing grocery store! Selection and prices are great, and the workers are all incredibly friendly even if they barely speak English. Even if there's trouble in communicating, they will keep trying to help you or find someone who can.

Butcher, fresh foods counter, dried goods, everything is fantastic here but unfortunately the produce isn't always the best. Most of the time it's OK but occasionally I'll come here and the green onions and cilantro look sad. If it was just a grocery store, that would mean 3.5-4/5 but the hot food counter is so good that it raises it to 4.5/5 for me."}
{"text":"After living in Southern California for a few years, I came back to Cleveland and could not find an authentic Mexican spot for tacos. La Plaza Supermarket is that place and I am so happy to have finally found it. I will be a regular here from now on. Amazing tacos and great customer service."}
{"text":"Taco bar was top notch. They are as good as any taco I've eaten in Mexico. This will be a regular stop."}
{"text":"I almost want to give myself endless forehead-smacks for not checking La Plaza out sooner. I mean, I've only been reading amazing reviews of this place for years now...

This place is a gold mine of delicious! From the outside you sort of expect it to be grimy and a little scary. Nope. It's clean, organized and has just about everything you need to have a Mexican feast. 

Salsas and guacamole to go? Umm, yes. Produce, spices, snacks, Mexican sodas, homemade bakery items, meats, booze... this is place is a gem. A real hidden gem--not like the over-used version of the term. 

I came back a second time the next day to give this taco cart a try. Oh.My.God. I don't even like chorizo, you guys. In fact, I avoid it. Their chorizo tacos and effing good. I ate one and was full, but managed to stuff in two more bites of the carne asada. It was delicious, but the chorizo was the clear winner. I barely even put toppings on and I was happy with just some cheese and cilantro. They are that good. If you don't have cash, you can pay for your tacos inside at the office and just bring your receipt out. They have an ATM too, but who the hell likes ATM fees? Not this girl.

I can't wait to stop here all the time. Like, way more than healthy amount."}
{"text":"The tortillas are incredible. Love the taco bar option. Super friendly and welcoming. Don't go to Barrio this place rules."}
{"text":"Maybe the best tacos on earth.
Only available Fri-Sat until 5 pm.
Chorizo and Asada are tops...seriously perfect."}
{"text":"Yaaaaaas! For REAL good tacos, like what tacos are supposed to be - come here! Very authentic , $2 each and never disappointing, offered with all of the appropriate toppings. 
Tamales are also excellent here as well as the pan de dulce."}
{"text":"Best place I know in the area for your south of the border food items. Great prices on quality made tortillas and a large selection of dried peppers."}
{"text":"I just recently moved back to Ohio from Cali and these tacos reminded me of Cali which made me feel good. Also they taste bomb asf."}
{"text":"While I have (sadly) never been to La Plaza for lunch, I do shop here quite often! It's the best place to go for unique ingredients for a decent price. I visit La Plaza when I want to make verde salsa (tomatillos are abundant here) or I need already ripe avocados. They also sell pre-made salsa's and guacamole, which are really delicious. 
I don't speak Spanish, so I don't always know what products are--but I love browsing the aisles and checking out the international products. La Plaza also sells a big selection of Mexican snacks and beverages, including glorious MEXICAN COCA-COLA and every Goya product you could want. The staff is always friendly and (everyone I have encountered) are bilingual."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed going here. I loved all the Hispanic food choices they have. You can purchase tacos and eat them while shopping. My type of store. Yes, I will go back there and shop"}
{"text":"WOW, my friend Young suggested this place to my girlfriend and I. All three of us are from California and love the heck out of some good mexican food! I grew up going down to the mission district in San Francisco (go warriors by the way) eating delicious, fresh, and cheap mexican food.

For what it is, even with Californian mexican food standards in mind, the to go food at La Plaza is ridiculous. 2 dollars for a taco, 5 bucks for a torta (sandwich with choice of meat and avocado slices and cheese) and 6 dollars for a burrito. Choices of meat are barbacoa (shredded beef), carne asada, Al pastor (marinated spicy pork), chorizo, carnitas, or chicken. Thats it, easiest menu to figure out. You pick the type, and just choose a meat. 

The tacos are a bit on the small side for $2, but it is literally all meat in 2 corn tortillas, then there is a little countertop area where you can add diced onions, limes, cilantro and your choice of a few different salsas. So, they can be filling especially if you eat 3-4 of them. I weigh about 180 lbs, 5 ft 8ish and 4 would be plenty for me. 

Please, do try this place. Theres also a cute super market too. Only downside is that it is about a 25 min drive from cleveland Heights. Do it do it do it if you like good homemade mexican food!"}
{"text":"Oh your favorite taco place is Barrio? That's cute. How about we slap some real authentic delicious tacos inside your mouth then see how you feel. Holy sweet baby Mexican Jesus! Sure it's at the back of a supermarket, sure it's hard to communicate if you can't speak Spanish, but the tacos are simple, tasty and only $2.50 each! 

The sign at the back says cash only, but you can pre-order your tacos at the lottery desk in the front and pay by card. Also, don't be intimidated if you don't speak Spanish, just smile and you'll get a warm smile in return from everyone, plus we all speak the language of food, they know what you're in there for and they're ready to give it to you. Have them load you up with all five taco offerings. Trust me, you won't regret it. 

Don't forget to add toppings like cilantro, lime juice, diced onion, guac or this yummy orange sauce to your tacos! Oh and do check out their other offerings like tamales, I haven't tried mine yet, but they look like a win! Actually don't come here, I don't want to share."}
{"text":"What happened to La Plaza?

First, let me say that the food here is the best, when they actually make it right. It's the best Mexican food in Ohio. Period. 

However, over the last year or so, the place has really gone downhill.  With the word of mouth about the food, it has become very popular. Apparently, the owners have decided to take advantage of this by raising prices, twice. Salsa, that used to be free on to go orders is now only \"for sale\" at $3.99 a container if you want more than 2 ounces. Even this would be alright is you could still get the great food, cooked properly and within a reasonable time period. 

In my last visit, the line to order was 17 minutes. It then took another 14 minutes to get it. Unfortunately, the woman who made it was so busy also doing food prep, so part of dinner came out over cooked and part of it was barely warm. Even at that, they still managed to make it wrong. When I pointed out that is was wrong, the woman opened the burrito and simply pulled out the wrong ingredients. OMG!

After I got the food, I had to stand in another line in the front of the store to buy the red and green salsa. Total time to get a \"quick take out\" dinner was over half an hour. Total cost for two burritos and salsa was $24.00

I've tried to go for lunch a couple of time over the past two months. Unfortunately, I don't have the time to wait for 25 minutes to order and get the food. 

It's a shame that such delicious food has become such a pain in the tush to actually buy."}
{"text":"Whaaat!? How have I been unaware of this hidden gem in Lakewood? In my search for Mexican ingredients I found this awesome Mexican Grocery Store + bakery and deli. Found all that I was looking for plus a few more delicious things  including dinner! 

In the back of the store they have a clean, basic sitting area of booths as you might find in a fast food restaurant. They make several varieties of meat tacos on warm corn tortillas plus some other menu items. We opted for the pulled chicken tacos which I have to say were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.  They are simple --corn tortillas (there are 2 or 3 stacked) filled with this perfectly seasoned, marinated, super tender chicken that looked to be all white meat chicken.  I am known to be super picky about meat in part because I don't eat much meat and in part because I do have high standards. As it should be, right?  Theirs was top notch.

On the side wall near the seating and by the cash register is a covered refrigerated case with condiments to top your tacos, burritos or other goodies.  There you'll find chopped cilantro, onions, radishes, cabbage, pico de gallo, salsas red and green, a guacamole sauce plus other cool stuff that I can't recall.  You can also order a cup of Mexican corn topped with lime, mayo or a cream, lime and cojita cheese (a delish white crumbly salty cheese). Rice and beans are made on site but no room for that this day.   Oh and tamales and torta sandwiches  looked awesome.  Next time!  So eat in or take it home but bring cash and pay at the back.   

I loved this place and if you are just talking food reviews these rank in the by best tacos even up against our more gourmet  Mexican restaurants in Lakewood. I know, I know it's not a restaurant with a fancy margaritas but based upon the food it could be. Seriously.  They do party packs so this might be just the thing for my next party! Don't forget to pick up chips and guacamole in the grocery before you sit down or head home to eat.  Great to support a locally own business."}
{"text":"I have found the tacos I've been searching for for my entire life. Since birth I've been seeking out the perfect tacos and I've finally found them. Everything that is made in this place is pure gold. Tacos, salsa, guacamole. Holy guacamole, it's so good. It's so good I can't even believe it. I've been around the world and I haven't found tacos this good. Okay, I haven't been around the world but I've been to like six or seven states, Canada, Costa Rica, and Mexico and these tacos are straight ballin. I'm kind of scared about how often I'll go here after trying this place yesterday. I honestly might accidentally pick up Spanish from the amount of time I'll be spending here. 

Conclusion: Oh ma gaaaaaah it's so good"}
{"text":"This place was an outright surprise! I've been craving tacos for awhile and conveniently found this place from recommendations from friends. This place was rightfully deserved so too.

When you pull up, it's exactly as described, \"A SUPERMARKET!\" On nice days, the front will have their outdoor kitchen open and you can order from right out front.

We opted to head in and check out the market which had a lot of variety from premade guacamole to cactus leaves. Though we didn't get anything grocery wise, there looked to be plenty of Hispanic options. We headed to the back of he store to find the indoor kitchen and proceeded to order the pastor, chorizo, pollo and asada tacos. For $2.50 each, you got your money's worth as these were fairly larger than what I was expecting. What is great is they have a little topping station where you can put as much or little as you want on. This ranged from cilantro to onions to the many sauces. I hadn't seen this before so it was definitely a plus! Definitely a worthwhile stop for anyone craving a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"I lived in San Diego for 2 years. While out there I've eaten some incredible Mexican food including tacos.  Upon moving back to Cleveland, I never thought I'd say the best and most authentic tacos I've ever eaten are in the Cleveland area. These tacos are just perfect. The homemade salsas blew me away. They have the perfect amount of heat without being too hot and they have a delicious flavor on top of it. I need to go back here soon."}
{"text":"This is an authentic mexican grocery store with a deli and a taco cart.

They have a small siting area in the back and outside but it gets busy. 


This is authentic tacos."}
{"text":"Just moved back to Cleveland after spending 8 years living in Texas and this is the MOST AUTHENTIC place for everything Mexican!

Street tacos = totally legit. Tortilla selection, meat deli, pan (bread) selection and everything in between is spot on.

It's not San Antonio, but it'll definitely suffice ;-)"}
{"text":"A little known secret which has the best tacos I've ever had in Cleveland . Sure other places have tacos but the tacos and quesadillas here are authentic and right off the griddle. Also in the summer, they cook them outside on the patio. I highly recommend going here to grab a snack that's authentic."}
{"text":"I left my wallet in El Segundo. I left my wallet in El Segundo. I got to get it, got, got to get it. This song should be played whenever i walk in this place. Every thing is just as amazing as my last 30 visits.

If you like paying 15 - 20 dollars for a few tacos then you should visit this establishment, order 4 tacos and leave a 10$ tip."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't tried this place sooner. I've been searching for authentic tacos, chasing food trucks around the city that inevitably disappoint, when I should've relied on yelp to steer me in the right direction. Damn good tacos. LEGIT, AUTHENTIC tacos. A good price at $2 a piece as well. 

You prepay for your tacos at the front registers and take your ticket to the back and make your order. Carne asada, chorizo, and al pastor, OH MY. Cravings satisfied. Carne asada was my favorite, but I can't wait to try more. 

I used to have to wait till my next trip out of town to find some good tacos, but no more. La Plaza is the real deal."}
{"text":"Visitor from Virginia - this place is local & amazing! Might seem a little unfriendly, but once you receive your tapas, you'll be comforted by their warmth and undeniable love!
Their side stands are all yours - add how much cilantro, salsa, sauce, onions and etc to your beloved food.

I got chicken, steak and chorizo. Steak was my favorite!"}
{"text":"La Plaza is why I love living in a city like Lakewood.  You don't really need to go to Mexico to have amazing carnitas tacos whenever you're craving the perfect street taco.  In a city filled with trendy taco bars and margaritas, La Plaza is a reminder of what I taco really should be.  

I've bought some deli meats, tortillas, and fruits here too.  It's obviously a great Mexican grocery store too.  But I come for the tacos."}
{"text":"Have you ever thought, \"Ugh! I need a taco,\" Well, I have the place for you.  From the outside this place might not look like much but this is the epitome of hidden gem.  You walk in and you are surrounded by mexican groceries but the real treat is in the back.  Credit card, cash, debit this place takes it all.  These tacos are the bomb diggity, simple menu with great ingredients. Special tip:  You can ask for Lengua (beef tongue), its for the locals ^_^  The salsa, guac pico mix, limes, cilantro and onion mix- ALL FREE!!!! Best best thing ever. You can peruse the grocery store and eat some of the to die for baked goods.  My favorite was this bread with cinnamon, raisins, maybe nuts?  WORTH IT!!  Check out this gem of a taco place, you won't be disappointed with these authentic mexican tacos ^_^"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to try the infamous la plaza supermarket tacos. Oh my word, people we're lying when they said it was the best tacos you'll have in Cleveland! My boyfriend & I got the carne asada & chorizo tacos. They were made to order & it only took about 5 mins to get our order. The tacos were so fresh, it was flavorful, & they were generous with amount of meat they put in each taco. We got 3 tacos each & we were stuffed! Can't wait to go back to get some more tacos & try some of their baked goods."}
{"text":"Great supermarket selection. Tacos are $2 with your choice of steak, chorizo and more. They are very well seasoned and tasty! You can also get rice and beans on the side."}
{"text":"I can't believe how hard it is to get authentic ethnic food here in Cleveland. Thank the lord & the ladies at La Plaza for this taco cart. The food is legit. The food is good. The payment is cash. Toppings are unlimited but don't go crazy or you won't be able to pick up your taco. Faceplanting is always an option though."}
{"text":"One of the very few places where you can get authentic Mexican/Latino products. You can get fresh baked goods and hard to find produce. There's a cheap and tasty taco bar in the back. On warm days you can find a taco cart right out front, beats most of the areas taco Tuesday deals."}
{"text":"THE TACOS. I got pastor, asada, and chorizo. Authentic. Delicious. Nice topping bar with cilantro, limes, onions and sauces. The market itself is cool to walk around and get unique items as well."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. I can't say I am an expert on what qualifies as \"authentic\" Mexican food being an American-born male raised on Taco Bell, but this place sure feels like it. It's a Mexican grocery store first with a small kitchen and seating area in the back corner. As you walk towards the ordering counter, you pass a bakery section with smells of fresh churros and cakes filling the area. The ladies behind the counter speak broken english which only adds to an atmosphere of anticipation as it relates to the quality of the food.

I ordered the carnitas, asada and barbacoa tacos. They cook the meat on a grill top right next to the counter and the creation is fast and simple. Tortilla, fresh meat and boom you are on your way towards the toppings station. They have a trio of salsas, onions, radishes, limes and a guacamole sauce that you can use to unlimitedly dress your tacos. I dressed mine up real nice although the meat was flavorful enough not to require much if one so chooses. Best $7.50 you will ever spend on a meal.

I will definitely be back again. Especially excited to try the torta, which looks incredible based on the pics."}
{"text":"absolutely amazing tacos and tamales! a little taste of home away from home for us. staff is really friendly as well"}
{"text":"This store has hands down the best tacos in Cleveland. The grocery store is a little different, I haven't actually shopped for anything besides the tacos but that is all you really need. $2.50 for a taco that tastes amazing. If you need authentic food you need to go here!"}
{"text":"Ok this hurts but I have to drop La Plaza from a 5 to a 4. Out of the 3 times I have been there, they have gotten the order right only 1 time. This time I looked at the paper she wrote down the order for my wife and I and it looked great. My wife asked for a bean and cheese burrito with sour creme and she got a bean, cheese, rice burrito. I asked for a Carne Asada burrito with lettuce, cheese, and rice and got beans, salsa, avocado (not a bad thing), and sour cream. Not sure how that worked out that way. 

I will definitely be going again because the food is really good but I won't be as excited as I was before. Also, I saw some bread with mold spots on it near the hot food area."}
{"text":"Very authentic. If you get a burrito they will put the toppings on for you, but if you get tacos you will put on the toppings. They are extremely hot, fresh off the grill, I burned myself because they were so good! These are so authentic you will be so happy you came here. The grocery store is great. The grocery store accepts credit cards but the taco stand does not."}
{"text":"The absolute best street tacos I've had outside of the Pilsen neighborhood in Chicago. Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"I liked the quaintness of the old store next to Mi Pueblo on Lorain.  Vegetables arent the freshest but beer and deli are a nice touch.  Prices have gone up a bit too.."}
{"text":"La plaza supermarket is a small Spanish supermarket in Cleveland. We came to get some fresh chorizo for our quesadillas that we were planning to make for dinner, and ended up getting a lot more. They also had some Pelo Rico candy imported from Mexico, that is pretty hard to find anywhere else. 

We also ended up trying some of their tacos due to yelp reviews we had read, and they were delicious! I tried the chorizo, al pastor, and carnitas. They come with a corn tortilla, then they have onions, cilantro, and sauces you can add to it. For 2$ each, it was definitely worth it, although I wished they were a little bigger. Regardless, I definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"If you are a foodie who loves exploring and going on local adventures, visiting La Plaza Supermarket is absolutely a must. The selection is much more extensive and the prices are cheaper than any other local Latino food store in the area. You can find pretty much anything from fresh meats, cheeses and produce to dozens of sauces and imported foods. You also can't leave without trying foods from the taco stand in the back of the store. It's the most authentic Mexican food I've ever eaten and relatively inexpensive. The one caution I have is to bring cash when you go. You can use cards at the register but not at the food stand. In just a review, I can't tell you how much I love this place! It's like traveling to another country for an hour!"}
{"text":"HOLY TACO!

I drive up to this little supermarket to see the taco cart out front. $2.50 per taco? What a steal.

These are the real deal guys. Two layered corn tortillas and the meat of your choice (I for one love the pastor and chicken). The coolest part? They have a cart specifically for toppings, so you can just load up on all the cilanto, onion, guacamole and salsa, free of charge. 

Best tacos in the city of Cle, hands down. The authenticity of the tacos is beyond compare. 

I'll be going here weekly now, no question about it."}
{"text":"This is my place! I love the staff and the tacos equally. Great atmosphere to bring you back to grocery stores in South America. It reminded me of my days in Peru. They have a few Peruvian items and the Inca Cola! The beer selection is unique and perfect to change it up."}
{"text":"I love places like this and I love tacos, and these tacos rock! They also have burritos, tortas and quesadillas. This full service latin grocery also has a nice bakery section!"}
{"text":"I had very high expectations for this place after reading all of the wonderful reviews but I was not all that impressed.  Our small group paid for the tacos inside and then walked over to the taco stand.  We ordered our tacos and then watched the staff cook uncooked meat right next to meat that was about to be served.  My first thought, cross contamination. Once the meat is placed in your corn tortillas you're encouraged to put vegetables (onions and cilantro) which are uncovered for who knows how long.  Each vegetable tray had plastic spoons inside, laying on top of the vegetables that were being offered to us.  My second thought, that's gross.  However, this did not stop me from piling on the veggies and a variety of sauces that they had to choose  from.  I normally will not eat after encountering situations such as these but I had to try the tacos because I've been searching for authentic tacos for years and I thought these were going to be it.  The tacos were good but not excellent.  Are they the best I've ever had?  No.  When you've traveled to Mexico and eaten tacos that were worth dying for, nothing seems to ever come close.  But wait there's more... within 20 minutes of eating my tacos, I was one very sick girl.  My stomach was not happy, I was nauseous, and felt extremely sick.  Because of how sick I felt, I will never visit again."}
{"text":"Choriso taco's on the taco cart- best I ever had. -- Guak  in deli is also amazing."}
{"text":"I love the grocery store. The best skirt steak. Make sure you get it marinated and add the homemade guacamole."}
{"text":"HOLY MOTHER OF GOD!! If you, like me, enjoy ethnic groceries go here for an indulgence in latin foods. I went for the in-store food area, and I will be back for it. Plus I will be back for the bakery. Plus I will be back for made to-go food. And I will especially be back for the tres leches cake. 

I was able to try the beef, al pastor, barbacoa, and chorizo. My favorite was the chorizo, but they were all delicious honestly. They don't only have tacos either. Tostadas, burritos, empanadas, oh my!

Like, nobody spoke English (at least of the workers that we interacted with). So if that is an issue to you, you're not invited. More for me!"}
{"text":"This place was a welcome Yelp find after I learned Mi Pueblo's grocery was no more. It's not a perfect place, but it does the trick. You'll find lots of staples from a variety of Central American and South American cuisines here, including fresh vegetables and diverse cuts of meat. A nice Hispanic beer selection and an outstanding bunch of prepared food options round things out. I'm looking forward to heading back to try a torta and some tacos after my next shopping trip."}
{"text":"Place to go to buy authentic Latin food to make at home or check out their bakery and taco cart."}
{"text":"This is a great place to show for authentic Mexican food. There are a lot variety of items to shop for in this store. 
Fresh salsa and chips 
We love getting the taco 's freshly made and all the fixings at the food deli.  You can eat right there !!
It is a a great experience !"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in Cleveland. Authentic Mexican tacos. I had carnitas, carne asada and pastor. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I must've come on a bad night...Friday at 5:30...all these reviews talk about all these different toppings you can put on your tacos and how authentic they are. My barbacoa taco had absolutely no seasoning and eat too much fat. Chicken quesadilla was okay. The piping selection they had to choose from was brown lines, chopped cilantro, sauces that looked like someone used one ladle for all four so they were mixed together, and I had to scrap the bottom of a pick bucket to get any tomato and onion. Place is already dirty enough, but then the tables were super gross too. I wanted to take it home to eat but my husband simply could not wait. Not sure how/why people were raving about this place...maybe I need to come in the summer when they have this supposed taco truck..."}
{"text":"Perhaps others have mentioned the tacos?? It's pretty simple: delicious, authentic tacos here. Carnitas and chorizo are my favorite but they have several others including tripe and tongue as specials on weekends. Quesadilla for the 2 year old with that delicious gooey white cheese - a big hit. So cheap - 20 bucks-ish for 6 tacos, the aforementioned quesadilla, two drinks and 3 pastries! Insanity! They expanded the seating area and re-did the toppings station so it flows much better now. You can pick up some drinks and pastries on your way back to the taco counter but remember - it's cash only back there. 

The rest of the store is great too. Fresh produce always looks great and most of it is reasonably priced. Homemade salsas, guacamole, pickled veggies - all delicious! Only dig is that I wish they had more South American items (they have some Peruvian, but not much else), but it is mostly a Mexican grocery so can't fault them too much. 

We love this place so much and are so lucky it's in our backyard! Get in there for the tacos and you'll be hooked I promise you."}
{"text":"I do not care what their rating is with the health department... there tacos are damn good! 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"after reading the rave reviews here on yelp and in search of a delicious authentic taco, my fiancé and i headed here for lunch today. 

the store itself is interesting and has some neat things. the people are friendly and there is a lot of parking available in the lot on the side. 

the food: i ordered two carnitas (my favorite) and one pollo. my fiancé ordered one pollo, carnitas and chorizo. i loved that they come bare and you add as many onions, cilantro and sauces as you please. to drink, i got a mandarin jarritos and he got a sprite. our food was ready in minutes and we decided to sit in the eating area. i was really excited for authentic carnitas and while the flavor was good, they were SO DRY. i had to put a ton of sauce and lime on them in order to chew through the tough meat. that was super disappointing, but i quickly forgot all about it once i tasted the chicken. it is AMAZING! juicy, tender and super flavorful. my fiancé agreed about the carnitas but thoroughly enjoyed his other tacos. 

before leaving, we browsed the store and found some really great wine deals and some interesting beers we've never had, which we bought. 

all in all, we will absolutely be back! the women who work here are really nice which is refreshing. i can't wait to try the other tacos and i always look forward to treating myself with a jarritos!"}
{"text":"Its awesome having an authentic Mexican grocery store two miles away.

       I've been here a billion times, and I've never had a bad experience. The taco truck carries some of the best summer food (especially the chorizo or al pastor tacos with lime and a tangerine soda=so much yum). Sometimes, I'm feeling lazy and don't want to make dinner-BAM pico do gallo and chips, ready to go. The guacamole is great too, but you have to get there early because it sells out. The desserts always look great, but I'm still working up the guts to try em. And I can always appreciate being able to spend about $20 and eat for a week. I'll pick La Plaza over GE any day!"}
{"text":"Just go. It's a Mexican supermarket with a full service deli and bakery with prepared dishes as well. Taco stand outside during decent weather is a must! Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Man, such a treat after living in the Mexican food wasteland of WV. Great selection for its size. Includes a butcher, a deli of sorts, and a bakery. The freshly made tamales, barbacoa, and menudo were amazing!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Cleveland!!!
Hands down!!!
Everything you could want when it come to a grocer and then throw in the homemade food and it's like none other!
A must visit"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had!  Not a huge fan of corn tortillas but its only $1.50 more for flour.  Its so worth it!  The al pastor is my favorite!  The ranchero sauce is so good too!  Definitely worth the trip!  Lunch hour gets busy but they move quickly.  Highly recommend if you love tacos!"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall! It's a supermarket but it has a grill in the back where they make made to order tapas (little tacos!) there's different kinds or you can get a vegetarian quesadilla! They're fresh and they have a bakery with a variety of baked goods for dessert! Very authentic place with a salsa bar and cilantro (my personal favorite)"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food in Lakewood Ohio? You betcha! In the summer, they have a taco cart kit front, but you can always go in and order. The fresh guacamole, pico  de gallo, and homemade tortilla chips are equally impressive. And the bakery... OMG! Can't say enough great things about La Plaza."}
{"text":"This place looks intimidating but don't be fooled! My friend waited for me in the parking lot because she wasn't sure if it was the right place. Yes- it is!! 
This is THE place with the authentic tacos and Mexican food. 
Head to the back of this grocery store to the hot food counter. (Take note of the awesome baked goods on the right side of the aisle on your way there!) You'll find a great mix of prepared foods ready to grab and go or order for lunch there (or also to go). This is where the magic happens. 

Tacos are $2.50 each. My favorites are the carnitas, the (new) pulled chicken and the barbacoa. But honestly, they are all good! I usually get three tacos because yum! They are plain with just the meat (authentic) and you have to add the salsas, cilantro, onions etc from the salsa bar to the right. Don't get me started on the avocado salsa. I want to steal the whole bottle. Every. Single. Time.

Tacos are great but burritos are so epic! Yes, epic. They are huge! At 7.50 you will easily gorge yourself or have two to three meals. But they are delicious! Choice of meat- then they add cheese, beans, rice, lettuce, onion, sour cream, slices of avocado... I opt for no onions but that's me. Chipotle burritos will never be the same after you enjoy this delight. 
The tortas are also awesome- same idea as the burritos but on a fresh baked bun. Many people don't know tortas and even think- beans on bread? Or just why? But let me tell you- if you like burritos, this is just another version of the goodness. 
Oh and they JUST ADDED corn to the menu. Sounds lame but it is Mexican corn-- get a huge cup mixed with cotija cheese, lime, butter and a little mayo for $2. I dream of this corn!
Also, grab some goods to take home. Fresh tamales! Yesssss! I always order a few dozen for Christmas parties too. Order ahead if you want a lot of one kind to make sure they are there. 
Grab a pound of carnitas meat ($7.99 lb) and then head all the way to the left and grab fresh salsas and guacamoles packaged up in containers. Amazing fresh corn tortillas available over there too for a nominal fee. 

Basically, the possibilities here are endless just in the hot food. Not to mention the awesome stuff throughout the aisles. And the people who work here are so nice and kind. Don't worry if you don't speak Spanish (they will help you) or have to read from this review to order- if you want some amazing Mexican food, this is the place."}
{"text":"Oh my. Great tacos exist here.

This place reminds me of some of the taco places I had been to in Austin- just randomly located in a parking lot or a grocery store, and out comes amazing tacos. Huh? No signage? No advertising? What? Yes, it's true!

Situated in a supermarket (yes a supermarket!), La Plaza doesn't disappoint. First, the supermarket is quite great, for your Latin-infused dishes and just finding some good produce and brands that would be hard to find in Cleveland. And now the tacos.

They're just randomly situated at the front of the supermarket, making tacos. 2 bucks a piece. Super delicious chorizo, al pastor, and carne asade, with lots of different sauces. It's hot and fresh and oh so delicious. We tried them all and they were so so good. The meat is plentiful, and the sauces are oh so good. They had a good amount of sauces, with each sauce being tasty.

So, yes, run to La Plaza if you're craving some good- and not fast food- tacos. So worth it!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. I went there for their 1 dollar taco. It was DELICIOUS. They made to order. Although it didn't seem very clean but it tasted awesome. They've also got a lot of different essential ingredients for mexican food preparation. MUST VISIT IF YOU ARE A MEXICAN FOOD FAN!"}
{"text":"What a great place!  I read about it on a Yelp email and since I needed chorizo to make chili, I stopped in.  Great prices!  The chorizo is yummy.  I will come back to get tacos!  Also, I have seen chefs on the Food Network cook with dried chiles but I never knew where to get them.  Now I do!  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I have stopped in at La Plaza twice now in the last two weeks.  Once on a whim (based on a glowing yelp review) and once more on a mission.  

Both times I left happy and excited to return. 

La Plaza stocks most of the general staples you'd need from most groceries, though obviously there is a strong lean toward mexican, Central, and South American goods. 

Especially delightful to me is the meat counter with not only fresh chorizo, but also fresh chincharrones (PORK RINDS!) by the pound.

The fresh guacamole, salsa, and pico de gallo (also available  at the meat counter) are all superb, however there is only one heat rating for both the salsa and pico.  You get what you get, and you'll like it, gringo/a.

The produce section has lots of items that would be hard to track down elsewhere, as well as reasonable to great prices on other more common items. 

On both visits the staff has been very friendly and helpful, and strongly urge others to visit and support them.  

As an added bonus they do have a taco cart, but it wasn't open one either of my visits.  I guess I'll just have to go back..."}
{"text":"After reading / hearing so many wonderful things about La Plaza, I knew I had to check it out for myself, especially because I live so close. So I needed a few odd ingredients for a Mexican dinner I was hosting, which was the perfect occasion to check out La Plaza! And after just one shopping trip, I'm pretty sure I'm going to be doing most of my grocery shopping here!

The produce selection was very impressive, in variety, quality and price. I use A LOT of cilantro, and I was excited to get a very generous bunch there for 99 cents (as opposed to the handful of tiny sprigs at Giant Eagle for $2). 

The fresh pico de gallo is maybe the best I've ever had. It is super spicy and tart and fresh, and was inexpensive ($3.79). 

I also picked up a tiny tres leches cake ($3) because they were too darling to pass up. I thought it would be a perfect dessert for my party, but once I got home, I decided it was way too small to go around, so I instead ate the entire thing while standing over my sink. It was disgusting. (My behavior, not the cake. The cake was awesome. You should definitely get one.)

I can't wait to try the tacos!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a traditional Mexican taqueria, so I search on Yelp and found this store which has a taqueria in the back, so I drove the more than 15 miles to get to this place just to be disappointed.
I had to admit that I've arrived one hour before closing but, that shouldn't be a reason for their poor quality food that they sell there.
First of all they pre-prepare the meats and the condiments early in the morning so by the time when I got there the food looked really old and nasty, the condiments like cilantro,onions,salsa and limes are all placed on a salad bar for all the customers to pick their favorites,the drawback of that is that by the time when I got to pick mine everything was mixed up salsa on the onions and the cilantro and the limes were old,very unattractive look. So I didn't start looking at the place until after I have placed my order and just by looking at the meats and the salad bar I had to throw my food in the garbage and walked away from that place. I thought about saying something but, what were they going to do?
Give my money back? Or replace the tacos for others with the same kind of meat? 
I didn't even tried so I just walked away and never coming back."}
{"text":"La plaza=hidden gem!!! I love this place for some simple tacos that aren't too overdone but have great ingredients. I feel like a lot of other taco places in are area are too focused on making some crazy flavor combinations or adding things that have no business being on a taco. I want fresh simple ingredients. I want to taste the flavors of the meat and cilantro. This is the place I can get all of that from. You also need to get a side of rice here as well. Very fluffy with simple flavor. Also while you are here check out the wide variety of food they have for sale. Meat for fajitas, carne asada, as well as some other things you definitely won't find at your normal grocery store. Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"The taco options are carnitas, steak, chorizo and something else. They have grilled peppers for an additional charge. The tacos are authentic and simple. They have side dishes of fresh cilantro, limes and onion to garnish your tacos when they come off the grill. They are only $2 per taco. They are only available on the weekend. I encourage taco lovers to come here! You won't have the hipster vibe of Barrio which is a plus!

The grocery store is pretty nice as well. They cater to Mexican cuisine and have things you will not find at a normal store (cactus and odd beef cuts). They have fresh made salsa and guacamole in the $2-$6 price range. They have the standard mild along with salsa verde. They have one of my favorite hot sauces as well for $2 and some change: El Yucateco Mayan XXXtra Hot."}
{"text":"This review is for the tacos and bakery in the back. I didn't really go through the rest of the store to evaluate then as a grocery.

$2 tacos that you pay for in the front and bring the receipt to in the back for them to make your food. The tacos themselves seemed pretty authentic and were tasty. By themselves though, I'm not sure they were unique enough for me to go out of my way to get them here. What stood out to me though is the condiments bar nearby. You can put as much cilantro, lime, hot sauce, grilled onions, fresh onions, and/or grilled jalapeño as you want!

The bakery was pretty typical, didn't seem super special. There are no labels on the goods, so my gf and I were at a lost of what we were buying and did so blindly."}
{"text":"The tacos are the most authentic mexican i have had in Cleveland. I have been hitting up this place for toca since the lil cart only sold on Sundays.

If you want a real Taco on the west side this is the place where orgasmic tacos are served."}
{"text":"I tried La Plaza for the first time a few weeks ago and loved it. They have authentic tacos-- real corn flour tortilla and real meat with seasoning. There isn't cheese, sour cream, or lettuce. These are not Americanized Mexican tacos-- these are real. They do have a little \"salsa\" bar with onions, cilantro, avocado, and some little home made salsa. The food is full of flavor!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently passed a perfectly pleasant afternoon at La Plaza shopping for dried chiles and other specialty items in the grocery, then relaxing on the patio stuffing our faces with the best tacos in all of CLE!

Notwithstanding the greasiness of the meat - which was a little much for my personal taste - the taco cart experience was perfect and oh-so-charming in its straightforwardness! 

I loved ordering my tacos, watching the meat on the grill, and serving myself from the sauce and condiment bar to the side. 

The bevy of hot sauces is a triumph! The carne asada and chorizo tacos were the stand-outs for me - but everything was fantastic! 

A trip to La Plaza perfect was to enjoy a cheap and satisfying afternoon that will whisk your imagination a million miles away from the rest of your Whole Foods/Panera Bread life."}
{"text":"So glad I finally had a chance to try La Plaza's tacos.  Authentic and tasty, reminded me of a vacation we took to Mexico.  

Certainly a no frills place.  The tacos are simple, made with just meat and a tortilla.  We chose chicken and it was a great choice. At the toppings bar you can choose from onions, limes, cilantro, 2 salsas and a fluid guacamole sauce. 

 These are not the tacos you will find at Taco Bell, but thank goodness they are not"}
{"text":"Well la plaza which use to be my favorite place in town, you are starting to slip. Shopping still is good however the taco cart outside is not. I have not stopped here in a long time as my schedule keeps me away. I decided to stop and check out the tacos. I ordered 2 carne asada and 1 al pastor. $2 tacos and $1.50 drink. Little guy whipped up some tacos and packaged them nicely. However he did not know the prices. Asked the her behind him and she charged me $8. $2x3=$6 plus a $1.50 soda which now is $7.50......hmm gratuity included? So I get going and upon going to eat, I find 2 carne somethings and a a carnitas? Wow how can you be from a country in which you are selling your national street foods and still don't get it right? Sad but this is true about the experience. Let along not too much flavor what so ever. If anyone is looking for good street tacos in cleveland take a drive down to Akron and check out La Loma. There you get a good deal on price, great service, and tacos with flavor that had been prepared with love of the food."}
{"text":"The Verdict: Just come here. You want tacos? You were planning to go where?! nono, turn around and just come here.

The Food: I bought the al pastor which is marinated bbq pork. So. Good. Usually I would write a lot but I'm speechless. A friend bought the burrito and it's the size of a newborn baby and thought it tasted amazing. I meant the burrito, not the baby. 

The Extras: The supermarket is a front to the chest full of golden tacos in the back. They sell a lot of authentic Mexican grocery brands and even Mexican baked goods/pastries. As for the tacos, I believe on the warm days they'll sell them in front of the store next to the picnic tables. If not, they're at the back of the store. I suggest also buying Jarrito soda to get the full experience."}
{"text":"I love the fresh latin selections the guacamole and salsas are great too I also love their steak tacos it's my favorite place to go on a nice sunny day or if I wanna stop and get some Latin staples for my kitchen !"}
{"text":"First time trying their tacos. Chorizo and Barbacoa on two fresh mini tortilla. Different salsa's available with fresh cilantro, onions, and limes. One of the best authentic Mexican taco's I've had in a long time. Each variety is an excellent blend of spices and ingredients. This ain't your typical Taco Bell taco. This is the real deal. One place you have to try if you are in Cleveland. Then they have a wide selection of hot sauce in their grocery store or anything else you would need for your mexican food needs."}
{"text":"It is nice to hear some Spanish being spoken in the Cleveland area.. having just moved to the east side, I was beginning to worry.

To some of the other reviewers who apparently haven't spent much time in other parts of the country, this place is not huge nor is it particularly cheap.  in Denver, there were two full sized Mexican grocery stores within a couple miles (and a number of stores of La Plaza's size).  Here, there is one convenience store sized Mexican grocery 13 miles away.  I guess you take what you can get.

The selection is ok for such a small store.  Most of the staples of Mexican cuisine can be found here.  The prices are quite a bit higher than I'm used to, though I guess supply and demand has something to do with that.  They do have Tuna/Cactus Fruit and nopales, which is a big plus.  Otherwise, I doubt that I will be making the trip very often as there really isn't a huge reason, other than a few specialty items, to go to a Mexican grocer like there is in Denver (waaaay lower prices on produce than everywhere else).

It's good to have such a place in the Cleveland area I suppose, even though this place would not survive in a market with actual competition."}
{"text":"Great local Spanish style food market. I recommend their meats, for they are very flavorful. Not like the bland meats Americans are used to at our over produced and over priced flavorless corporate crap.  Their produce here is not very fresh, so don't expect to get a whole lot in that department. I do enjoy their tomatillas because they are always in stock and good. Also, you have to get the tamales or fesh premade salsas and guacamole!!! High demand there! Very friendly staff. I really enjoy shopping at LA Plaza and happy with the easy accessible location."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place I love- cheap, friendly, fast, a little grimy, but most importantly- they do one thing really, really well...and that thing is tacos. 

In case you couldn't tell from the title, this place is a supermarket. Not a very nice looking supermarket, and certainly not the kind of place I would expect to find a lunch spot. The service style kind of reminds me of Galluci's, in the way that the setup is an ethnic grocery with a little food stand in the far back. As others have mentioned, it helps if you speak a little Spanish, but if you don't, you can probably still get by just fine. This place didn't get any points from me for cleanliness- the tables weren't wiped, and the girl cashed me out with the gloved hand she had probably been chopping meat with. But you know what- I'm still giving this place five stars, because it was delicious, and a little dirt won't kill ya. I also got a warm, friendly smile from each and every person that works here, even the ones that weren't serving me- and in my book that counts for far more than a table wiped by a girl with a scowl on her face. 

Their menu board is pretty simple- choose the kind of meat you want in your taco, then sit and wait while they make it (easily less than 5 minutes). I chose three types of meats, but the two I liked the best were the chorizo and barbacoa. The meat is really well flavored, which is probably why it's such a great stand alone item. I should mention that they only serve beef and pork here- if there was a vegetarian or chicken option, I certainly didn't see any. The tacos are served double wrapped in a corn tortilla (something I really appreciated both for added taco durability, and extra tortilla to scoop up the bits that fall off while you're chowing down). The toppings are placed in the dining area nearby so you can help yourself. The toppings they serve are traditional Mexican style- chopped onion, chopped cilantro, lime slices, and some salsa options. Super simple, and super delicious. They also have bottled pop, as well as some of the traditional Mexican drinks such as Jarritos. They do sell beer & alcohol, but I'm guessing their liquor license doesn't allow it to be consumed on the property, because there was a sign saying guests aren't allowed to drink alcohol in the dining area. 
I've waited to the end to mention the most important part- these tacos are $2 each....$2 people. If all of the aforementioned items haven't convinced you to try this place, then I hope the low, low price of $2 per taco does. 

I would also like to add that they sell a lot of specialty desserts, ready made salsas and guacamole to purchase to take home, as well as some unique fruits and veggies for those that are so inclined to browse around the grocery store. Will certainly be back to try some of those items, but even if this place only served tacos, I would be more than satisfied!"}
