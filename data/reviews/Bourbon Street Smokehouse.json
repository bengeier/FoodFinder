{"text":"Had the corned beef sandwich delicious!! Best corned beef I've ever had. Some slight hiccups running out of certain beers and POS machine not working properly. however, All in all super friendly staff was delicious food was an  enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"Im a bit of a foodie and I've lived in Toronto all my life, but have never been to a smokehouse. Im glad to that Bourbon Street Smokehouse was my first.   I went with two of my foodie friends and we all decided to each get the \"Sampler for One\" meal so we could try a variety of food.  \"Sampler for One\" includes 2 mains and 2 sides.  I didnt expect the portions to be as big as they were.  We all just had to try the Texas Beef Brisket for our first main... you CANNOT go wrong with it! That is a promise! It smells incredible and as for taste.. out of this world! It is so rich in flavour and  melts in your mouth, its kind of an experience you have to live yourself in order to know.   Ribs were great, especially because is was brushed with their homemade  BBQ sauce.   Sausage was pretty good, but not something I was really wowed by.   The sides were AMAZING.  Cesar salad... was a Caesar salad but it was elevated with there in-house smoked cheese.  Mac and cheese was to die for. Very cheesy and even tasted very smoky. It tasted more smokier than the meats tbh. Don't know if they used a specific cheese, smoked their cheese as they did for the Caesar salad, or added liquid smoke.  Beans were delicious and had a nice sweetness to them.  Coleslaw.. I can only say that it was good, because I'm more used to a mayonnaise-based coleslaw not a vinegar based one.    They give you a set of sauces; ketchup, mayo, malt vinegar, BUT their home made sauces... SO GOOD! Mississippi BBQ sauce was smoky with a very mild kick to it,  we at first assumed it was the best, since they gave us two full bottles of it, and it was... we finished both bottles.  Memphis BBQ sauce was pretty similar to the Mississippi BBQ but slightly sweeter from the pineapple.  Didnt try the Carolina Sauce, cause we were too into the first two.  White gold, tasted very similar to a caesar dressing but was slightly different, I couldnt put my finger on it.  I tried a dot of the Ghost Pepper sauce, the first few seconds were good, but the heat slowly builds. So if you like spicy, this one's for you.    That was the food, but as for service, our server was a little slow in the beginning while taking our orders. Seemed like she was still trying to understand how to place an order on the tablet. That was okay, we were patient enough to wait.  But as for the rest of our dining experience, she barely came by our table, but more like looked at us from afar.  When we were done with our meal, we asked for to-go containers and the bill. She left and never came back, only clearing half of our table.  We tried to patiently wait, but seeing as she pretty much ignored us, because like I said, she would look at us from another table and looked away, we talked to the other waiter.  She was very helpful, and gave us whatever we needed within seconds, which made the experience a lot better.  Aside from the service from that one server, I definitely recommend trying this place out. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"For a place that's been open for about two months, they really know how to please people. Bourbon Street Smokehouse was spotted during a walk back to Ossington Station, and visited a couple of days later. My group was the first set of diners, but more people seemed to come in as we ate, and by the time we left there were a nice amount of tables filled up.  To start, there are some excellent drinks available - draught, canned, and bottled - and a list of delicious sounding cocktails. I was limiting myself, so I just got a can of Guinness.  My companions shared the \"sampler for one\" (and had trouble finishing that, to give you either an idea of how my friends have small stomachs, or how big the portions are) which consisted of ribs and brisket (their choice out of the options of ribs, two types of brisket, pulled pork, and sausages), while I opted for a full rack of ribs. You're given a choice of two sides for both, so we shared the Waffle Fries, Corn Bread, Macaroni and Cheese, and Baked Beans.  MAINS The Brisket was nice and tender, however, there wasn't much spice on the outside. Adding a bit of sauce definitely helped, but it was rather pleasant - definitely not as overpowering as some. The Ribs on the other hand are cooked incredibly well. They're not fall off the bone juicy, but they are still very tender. The tips of the rack were chewy and a nice treat saved for after the devouring of the main bit.  SIDES Starting with the Corn Bread, it's very nice to find a place that does a corn bread that manages to stay pleasantly sweet without being overpowering, and fluffy without practically falling apart in your hands. The edge pieces were just slightly crispy, giving a nice crunch to some of the bites, but the bread itself was succulent. The Waffle Fries were very similar. A crunchy outside with a super fluffy potato inside. Not an abundance of grease or oil either, which was nice on the fingers! The Mac and Cheese noodles were nice and soft, covered in cheese that had melted all the way through. I couldn't pinpoint the cheese, but it was a very unique taste that I didn't often get (and definitely wasn't KD). The beans, I can't really describe aside from delicious. There was such a nice sweetness to them, they weren't too hot, and weren't too cold, and I'm pretty sure I could survive just off them if absolutely necessary.  SAUCES When you're brought your meats at Bourbon Street, you're also brought a rack of sauces. You have the malt vinegar, mayonnaise, and ketchup and mustard standards, but then you have 6 sauces that each have their own profile.  The Smokey BBQ is by far my favourite. It's a good balance of savoury and sweet, and has a nice smokey flavour to it (as it should) that mixes perfectly with their meats. If you had to pick ONE sauce to go with anything on their menu, it would probably be this! (Also, their ribs come out with a light covering of it to encourage people, due to some being scared off by dry rub ribs coming to their table like some places) Their Mississippi BBQ is a nice mild sauce, not much heat to it, with a fairly nice vinegar undertone. It's a good standard BBQ sauce, and pairs well with ribs (and mixes VERY nicely with the smokey BBQ). The Memphis BBQ has nice, sweet undertones, which makes sense, as it's apparently made with pineapple juice! It's got a very mild vinegar aftertaste, but you likely won't get much of it if you're devouring it on the rest of your meal. Their Carolina sauce has a nice, light heat for people who want a bit of kick to their sauce. It's got a stronger vinegar tang to it, but that's the kind I'd like on some nice back ribs to match the tenderness. The \"White Gold\" they offer is more of a side sauce, used for fries and the like. On it's own it's a bit underwhelming, and makes me think of a caesar dressing, but more saucy. Still, it's not bad, and a little bit on ribs is actually surprisingly nice! Finally, they have a Ghost Pepper sauce. Now, before you run away, please note this is not nearly as hot as SOME sauces that use the Bhut Jolokia pepper. It starts off very vinegary, which lulls you into a false sense of security, followed by a build up of that familiar hot kick from the pepper that (for me) lasted about 30 seconds before evening off. I do not recommend brushing your ribs with it, but if you are a serious spice-head, then this is probably the sauce you want to go with. Fun fact: Putting this on the ribs with the smokey bbq was incredible. The sweetness is a great opener to the heat that hits hard.  OVERALL VERDICT: Would I recommend Bourbon Street Smokehouse? Of course. It's still finding it's feet, so expect some bumps along the way, but give them a fair shot, you won't be disappointed. Just steps from Ossington Station, too - which is an excellent location!"}
{"text":"What a gem! This used to be an old shisha lounge that is now a BBQ joint. The server was friendly and prompt given she was the only one serving the entire restaurant.  We ordered two racks of ribs and shared the Mac & Cheese and waffle fries.  The ribs were the largest portions I have ever gotten in this city. Each rack was at least 3 lbs and the Mac & Cheese and fries were very large as well. The ribs were tender, the sauce was tasty and there was literally endless amounts of meat. The fries were well seasoned and very crispy. The Mac was good as well. Will be back again when this is my only meal of the day!"}
{"text":"I had some high expectations when I saw this restaurant with a 4.5 on yelp. My first time at a smokehouse was going to be a great experience. Did this place meet my expectations? Almost. But they were set very high.   We ordered the sampler for two with Salmon, Brisket, St Louis ribs, potato wedges and Mac & cheese. Portion sizes were quite generous - this could have fed 3 people! Seeing as I shared this with one other person - I got lunch for the next day.  The brisket was by far my favourite. It was very tender and flavourful on its own, but when I added the Memphis bbq sauce it went to a whole new level. The salmon was an extra charge and it was not great. If I were to return I would not order this again. The Mac & cheese was nothing to write home about, but the potato wedges are a must order! They are soft and crunchy at the same time and are topped with a flavourful seasoning. Some of the best I've had.   Next time I'm craving BBQ, Bourbon Street will be on the shortlist."}
{"text":"Just OK. Had the beef brisket, pulled pork and ribs as part of the platter for two. Mac & cheese + baked beans sides. Wanted to try out their chicken wings as well, so we ordered up some of those.  From the platter, the beef brisket was the best part by far, but still not near the best we've had. The processed cheese in the Mac & cheese was still in partial strip form on top and not melted proper into the mac.  Chicken wings were great and the variety of sauces are solid too. The 'hot' sauce is not that hot. I'm not sure if they had hotter, didn't ask.  Another plus is the food portions are pretty large. A platter for two (including the two sides that come with it) will absolutely satisfy a party of two.  Bottom line, I've had much better BBQ, and if you are into some good BBQ like we are, you'll think the same."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Truly Texas level barbecue.   The atmosphere is pleasant, but with very low lighting which isn't really my thing but I can't knock off points for that.   Our server was very rude. Hardly serviced us at all, she kept running to the back room. Lost a star for the service."}
{"text":"Very delicious, huge portions (left overs were enjoyed at home), would recommend the ribs!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's good.  It's really good!  I've had BBQ from all over the US.  This restaurant has some of the best!  The beef brisket was tender and juicy.  That corned beef brisket is really good.  The sampler has enough food for two people to share, especially with the two side dishes.  The mac and cheese has smoked cheddar.  It need a little salt and pepper to kick up the flavor.  Just add it at the table.  Let's not forget the cornbread...delicious!  If you are in Toronto, check this place out!!"}
{"text":"I went with a very large group for dinner (14 of us) and we were seated at two long tables. Our server went over the menu with us and explained the various platters and what you get with each one. Four of us decided to go with the family combo of five meats and four sides for $90. I think this was a really great value.   For the meats, we chose the St. Louis ribs, pulled pork, Texas brisket, smoked salmon and sausages. For our sides, we chose sweet potato fries, waffle fries, mac & cheese and corn bread.   I was not a huge fan of the pork or the brisket, but that's likely due to the style they use. The pork was too 'stringy' for my liking and it was kind of mushy, and as for the brisket, I prefer the kind that is sliced vs. pulled. The salmon was very delicate and not what I'm used to, but I did like the maple flavour. Apparently, they don't prepare the salmon in-house, but they do finish it there. A bit confused as to the reason behind that, but I guess they focus on their meats.   I liked the sausage and the ribs best - we all agreed that we should've doubled up on ribs for the amount you get. Not enough for each person in our foursome to have two ribs each, so we had to flip for them!   I loved the corn bread! It was a bit sweet, but really moist and served warm. Yum!! Actually, I have no complaints about any of the sides - they were all good!! Probably the best sweet potato fries I've ever had. I also really enjoyed the various sauces they bring to the table. Great variety and such a nice change from just one sauce that most BBQ places offer.   Despite not really loving every component of the meal, I was really happy with the service, which is why I bumped them up to four stars. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating for our group, and happy to split bills for us, which can be a hassle at some spots. I would gladly return here for more meaty goodness in the future!!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience. From the attentive staff to the delicious food. You have to try the brisket! Everything was absolutely perfect. Celebrated my wife's bday with a great meal. Highly recommend this joint!"}
{"text":"Awesome Brisket and Ribs - Check it Out!   This newly renovated location has mouth-watering food, impeccable and friendly service and walls filled with TV's for real-time sporting events. The dishes all come with sides that would qualify as an entire meal! The Brisket can be cut with a fork and the smokiness is perfect. Lots of sauces to customize your meat and excellent value for the price.  The restaurant has lots of tables and a great lounge in the back with leather couches and large screen TV's. Perfect for corporate events, parties or just laying back to watch a game."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!!  BEST BBQ ribs, chicken & beef brisket I've EVER HAD!!!!  Seriously delicious!!!!  Great atmosphere, sat up front near the window in a very cushy loveseat which was just what I needed after a long day on my feet.  Server was so friendly & very accommodating in every way.  The meat was the most tender, moist & tasty that I seriously was in heaven with every bite!  The spices were so good that I didn't even want to cover any of it with the extra sauces that are served on the side, however the Mississippi Sauce was really delicious.  I cannot say enough about the meat here, incredible, & I AM VERY PICKY.  Will make this a regular trip, for sure."}
{"text":"So glad this place is here instead of what was previously there (which I also reviewed and was terrible). This is some of the best barbecue in the city, and luckily close to home! We got the platter for 2 (it served 3 people well), which comes with your choice of 3 meats & 2 sides for $40. The portions are very generous & everything was delicious. We got the: ribs, texas brisket, pulled pork, baked beans, waffle fries & added a side of corn beard (only $4.50).   So for $45 you can feed 3 people a decent amount of delicious food. My only reason(s) for not giving this place 5 stars is the service & vibe. They were understaffed so it was a bit slow when it came to drinks, and the bill. I also wish that instead of having a lounge in the back of the restaurant, they would put something more lively back there. Maybe some darts, shuffleboard, etc."}
{"text":"Ordered their corned beef brisket sandwich along with potato wedges. The corned beef smelled and tasted like boiled hot dogs and the wedges were very average. Gonna pass on this joint in the future. Not impressed."}
