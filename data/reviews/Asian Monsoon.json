{"text":"I have to respectfully disagree with the first reviewer.  I had dinner at Asian Monsoon tonight and the food was really not good at all.

I was with my daughter so I wanted something not spicy to share with her. It was clear in my questioning of the server that their sauces come in cans/bottles/vats because there was no chance of adjusting spiciness.  Her advice was to stick to something with no \"chili pepper\" symbol next to it.  Fair enough.  So I ordered ginger chicken.  The saving grace was that the chicken appeared to be white meat and the veggies were fresh, but it was exceptionally bland.  No hint of ginger, not even any salt.  Just a corn-starch thickened sauce (sauce being a generous word for the gelatanous film covering my food).

One of my fellow diners has a bad reaction to MSG, and without recapping the whole conversation it was clear there could be no guarantees about the omission of MSG from any meal.  No report back from my companion on her post-meal MSG status, but she commented that her dish was quite dry and bland.  That explains all the dipping in soy sauce.

Thai cooking is known for its balance of flavors--a mix of savory, sweet, sour, salty.  The mango salad, which is typically sweet and sour with some vinegar, was pretty much just sweet.  It wasn't awful, just not good.

The service was good and accommodating.  My toddler made the usual mess, and I did the usual hands-and-knees routine to make sure toddlers remain welcome in restaurants, and the server was super nice in insisting she would take care of it.  

It's definitely the kind of place that has a cook, not a chef, in the kitchen.  If you're really, really hungry and it's the only place open you may find something passable.  One of my other companions was happy with his meal, though I can't recall what he ordered."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Toronto, I ordered some delivery from Asian Monsoon at the suggestion of the concierge at my hotel. Can I just say it was the best Thai food I've had outside of Thailand, even if some of it was a little \"westernized.\" Just spicy enough, and the portions were very generous. Loved the lemongrass soup, basil eggplant, and red vegetable curry. I'll be sure to order again next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This was a walk-in off Queen Street one Sunday morning, as it was one of the few businesses who value profit and eschew bankruptcy and open their doors Sunday morning to the teeming masses of Queen Street who would like to give someone their money in exchange for goods and services.

It was a wonderful surprise, the food was EXCELLENT and priced within reason.  The pad Thai was cooked perfectly and not overly spicey, and the recommended green curry dish was very tasty.  Service was excellent as well, sure the place was a bit empty that time of the morning but we were well looked after with a friendly smile.  The room was very nicely made out too, with comfortably clean washroom facilities.

A new favourite haunt in the making."}
