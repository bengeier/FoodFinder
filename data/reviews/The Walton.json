{"text":"This is a cute place to grab a coffee or tea and a snack during the day or a drink at night. It's cozy and unpretentious. The food is simple but delicious. I think it's going to be my go-to in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This is truly one of the most adorable cafes in little Italy. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, the servers are polite and down to earth, and the food and drink is DELICIOUS! Do yourself a favour and try one of the chèvre toasts; it's such a simple open faced sandwich yet it's like a fine dining experience, and you can see the staff out such care into creating your food.  The restaurant is ground level and can be accessed with a wheelchair or stroller, however there is no push button for the door."}
{"text":"The Walton is such a great addition to the neighbourhood.   During the day it's such a pleasant place to sit for a coffee. They don't seem to be afflicted by the laptop scourge and their snacks are yummy. Had the apple scone and a pot (a real pot) of tea and all was great.   In the evening it's so cosy and their cocktails are really good.   I hope they do really well."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. It's beautiful inside, the cocktails are amazing and the owners are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"We didn't try any food, but I expect nothing but the best from the Walton. This is the cutest place and I love the classy antiquey decor. The patio is definitely adorable. The bar is quaint and marble and farmhouse mod. The drinks are tasty and the tenders are cool. We had a really nice time here. Oh and how cute is the wash room? Totally cute."}
{"text":"Wonderful in every way. Sunny, warm, tastefully decorated, warm and friendly servers, high quality cocktails and delicious charcuterie plates. A perfect experience that I will certainly repeat."}
{"text":"'Twas a late summer, early fall sort of evening; just warm enough to sit among the fairy lights and foliage and cool enough to indulge in some decadent treats and libations.  We started off light and had some Dieu du Ciel Rosée d'Hibiscus and a nice dry cider (Spirit Tree from Caledon, ON). We split the wonderful Skagenröra, which is a shrimp salad with dill and salmon roe on a Swedish open face style sandwich. Yes.  The next dish was a *delicious* savoury mushroom and brie pie baked by the Pie Commission. It was served with a generous helping of greens and thinly sliced apples in a tangy vinaigrette. We sipped on Stranger than Fiction porter by Collective Arts Brewing. Yes, yes.  Some good friends arrived and the Walton was a charming backdrop for our ever flowing conversations and laughter. Yes, yes, yes!"}
{"text":"I love the Walton. It is so beautiful. I came here for a birthday around 12:30am pre-Christmas. The decor is beautiful and the white painted brick with the Christmas lights and the lovely mini-florals on the table? Beautiful.   Service was a bit slow but other than that I had a wonderful time. Good drinks, nice snacking food and apparently they have a dope back patio for warmer weather. They have a basket of blankets if you get cold - SOLD.   Come here! Actually, don't otherwise I won't get a seat. But do because I want them to flourish. Lovely place."}
{"text":"This place just opened up 2 weeks ago.  It wasn't packed so it was nice for our party of 7.  Seats were comfortable and cozy and drinks were thoughtful and tasty.  My friend and the goat cheese pie and he said it was delicious.  The rest of us just had drinks, and they were all great!  Will definitely check this place out again."}
{"text":"Such a gem! This place has character and is so quaint you just want to stay there forever.   Service was great, and the atmosphere inside makes you go back in time.   We had the cake of the day and tea which was perfect for sharing and catching up with a friend.   Our new favourite place, definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this spot - it is my new go-to for daytime work (they don't seem to mind too much if you bring a laptop), reservations for 1 (easy spot for a nice solo meal - love the pie commission pies), friend-in-town drinks/cocktails (great atmosphere, good drinks) and of course coffee. Feel very lucky to have The Walton in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Very cute place for a few drinks with friends or a date. Cocktails are great here. I liked sampling the cheese too."}
{"text":"Quaint atmosphere, lovely in the summer when the front windows open up. If you're with a group of 4 or less get one of the tables in the nook in the front."}
{"text":"I've heard about the \"most adorable patio\" being at The Walton - so it was definitely on our summer to-go list this year! On this Friday evening, there was just enough room for 2 in the patio, lucky for us, without having to wait (however, there was plenty of room indoors).  The patio is really cute. Small, under a canopy of trees with lights wrapped around the trees. There was a group of people as well as some couples and trios. Overall crowd was a bit older (late 20's to 40's) but I also noticed some younger student-types inside.   This place is great for drinks - we tried three of the cocktails and really enjoyed them!!! But they've got a really small selection for food - some cheese, some meats, mostly appetizer style. We did have some swedish shrimp salad thing and that was very good!  Overall, this place is a pretty cool visit for a drink and a snack. One star off because of a bunch of things combined - snack menu limited, indoor decor gave off a coffee and croissant vibe, a bit on the pricier side, etc. We've been to places with small menus but those menus are usually crafted to get you full after 2-3 selections...here there wasn't much I wanted on the menu.  We came here for a drink and a snack before having dinner, and that really worked for us."}
{"text":"A much-needed spot in the neighborhood. Eclectic beer and cocktail menu, chill atmosphere. Great staff."}
{"text":"Wow, is this cafe ever CUTE. I feel like I'm being transported to another time period with the lovely wooden furnishings, the muted vintage-y colour palette, jazz playing in the background...   The patio at the back is super IG-worthy - whimsical, floating lanterns, light-bulb christmas lights, perfect fallen leaves from aged trees... If you're about that life, get in here.   Ah, btw, they have an awesome oatmeal raisin cookie that has a tinge of orange flavour - pretty awesome! Looking forward to coming back for some real food!"}
{"text":"Yum, Yum, Cute, Cute!  Went here with some family members for post-work drinks and bites. The Walton is awesome. You walk in and can tell the owners are people that a) love what they do & b) care about your overall experience at their carefully-curated establishment.   The cocktail/beer/wine list is superb. I was in the mood for something 'light and fizzy' and our server immediately recommended a cocktail which was delicious (and just what I had in mind). My fellow drinking partners had various cocktail selections - all of which were beautifully presented in cool mugs/glasses. My cocktail was followed by 2 glasses of a local, buttery-but-light pinot gris.  The food: the Walton doesn't have a 'full kitchen' but serves delectable snacks and pies... so you'd never really know they don't have a big kitchen. Get a pie if you're hungry - the scent alone makes it worth it. We shared a few of the fish dishes and cheeses. All quite good. I'd highly recommend the Gravlax. Yum."}
{"text":"The Walton was everything I'd hope it would be. Beautiful, classy, elegant yet casual. This was a great spot to bring & impress a date.   Every inch of this place was thought out of in terms of design & aesthetic - there was always something beautiful to see. Even our drinks were served under shinning, silver coasters.   I'd highly recommend checking this place out for drinks - their patio when open is incredibly charming. But I'd also be very curious to see how it operates in the day-time as a coffee shop.   I'll be back xoxo"}
{"text":"Love the Walton. Cozy, charming, tasty snacks. Lovely pastries from the Tempered Room (although later in the day, probably none left). In the winter, I love that they have a hot toddy on the cocktail menu - makes it the perfect place to warm up on a blustery day! They do their own pickled herring as well, which is really quite tasty. Favourites are duck liver mousse with house rosé (only $9/glass). Very easy to spend an afternoon or evening here."}
{"text":"Adorable little cafe/bar! Came today to grab a snack and a coffee before an appointment. I had the Chicken \"pie\" with greens and a latte. Also had hummus to start. The latte was tasty and smooth and served in a class drinking cup - very cute. The chicken pie had a delicious flakey pasty shell and had chicken, mushrooms and potatoes inside. Great flavour! The greens had apples and cucumbers as well as a nice sweet dressing. Very refreshing! The hummus was warmed and had a nice spice on top - served with grain chips, a great starter! Overall, It was very filling and larger than I expected (which was great because I was hungry!) I saw others getting charcuterie type boards - the meat and cheese on the menu sounded amazing. I'll defiantly try that next time! Really chill vibe in the cafe, a little bit of a vintage feel with mix matched China! So cute. Our waitress was friendly and joined in our conversation, she was very attentive and sweet. Overall a lovely place for a small meal/snack and coffee or a drink or two!"}
{"text":"The Gabardine is a fave of mine, and I'm pretty sure an original owner of that restaurant is involved with this bar. Either way, the Walton is a pretty perfect little spot - sophisticated, but welcoming decor, reasonably-priced drinks, and a small selection of decent food. The only trouble is that the service, while friendly, was a little slow - sometimes had to wait 10-15 minutes for a pint that just takes a few seconds to pour. Still, I think that was just a service kink that'll be worked out in the future. I really hope this place sticks around - it's the kind of bar/cafe that you want to become an institution, rather than the normal 2-4 year flash in the pan."}
{"text":"Place was cozy; decor is quaint. Waitresses were super nice but the bartender seemed less than impressed to see us. Perhaps it's not not normal to approach the bar when nobody seats you right away.  The beef pot pie has a very buttery crust with a oniony spiced loose ground beef filling. When you close your eyes and have it, it tastes like a really fancy Jamaican patty.   Hummus came warm with these brown flatbready crackers. Hummus tasted a lot like curry, weirdly.  Things are a bit pricy for the quantity but food is nice overall. Worth a visit for a late night snack."}
{"text":"So I d gone past here a few times and really liked the look of it. Checked out the menu and raves from fellow Yelpers and thought I d check it out. For lunch. On my birthday. BAD idea.   Originally, I d thought it was great to find a sweet, elegant looking place like this, open midday. Sadly, we paid the price. We went in, the music was cool, the decor is great. A nice change to find a restaurant on a main strip with washrooms on the main floor. The staff were friendly, but unfortunately became less and less attentive rather quickly. There was only one other customer while we were there, for a short time. There were at least 3 staff and either 3 more staff members/friends of staff (definitely  not customers) who had come in after us, sitting at the bar YELLING SO loudly at one another over the music. This was non-stop. So loudly, in fact, that I couldn't hear my dining companion who was less than a foot away from me (and we were as far away from the bar as possible). Sad.  Having worked in the industry for many years, I am not unfamiliar with having seen servers become lax in their service when it s slow/quiet and the manager/owner isn t around (at least I m hoping said manager/owner was not one of the inattentive staff). No doubt this was the case here. The table  we sat at was tiny, and after not having anyone come by to clear empty dishes (this is 15-20 mins of them sitting in front of us and no other customers in the entire restaurant, save for the 3 friends at the bar. I finally moved them to a side table to make room. Even then, they sat there another half an hour before anyone came by.  We had the salami board that comes with bread, Dijon, a tiny gherkin and one little pickled onion. It was good. Not terribly generous for the price, however. Also the lemon tart was great. Lots of varieties of teas. The rest of the menu looked interesting as well as the cocktails. Even with the tea, no sugar/milk was offered. Sadly, just the bare minimum was provided, especially regarding service.   Would I come back here again? I d be willing to give it a shot, but am rather gun shy after my initial experience. I d honestly rather spend my money on a place that cares about its customers."}
{"text":"Stopped in here during the afternoon with my friend and baby. The place itself is so adorable and the decor is rustic and lovely. As we entered the bar was covered with delicious pastries.   We opted to sit in the adorable patio in the back. There are quite a few seats and lights hung all over the place.   The coffee was good but the service was even better. They were attentive and so sweet with my baby. The general vibe there was lovely. Friendly staff and customers. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A great space with a beautiful vibe and great sense of hospitality. If you are thinking of stoping by and trying it out.... Just stop thinking and do it. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Adorable and charming place with a great back patio as well. Great service. Great for drinks and food. In terms of food there is something for everyone, they offer two vegetarian pies, plus the standard hummus and olives and meats and cheese etc. Also good cocktail menu."}
{"text":"This place... is one of the most legit and adorable places for coffee, cocktails and delicious snacks. I have never actually stepped into the back patio but it looks absolutely cute from the inside.   The vintagey decor and antique-ish cutlery and plates really won my heart. I have returned to this place several times already and I would really recommend everyone to try their pickled fish and pies!  Service is a bit slow but these guys don't have a full kitchen so I'm totally okay with it.   Overall, I love the Walton, these guys really spent a lot of time and thoughts to make this place work. Everything is beautiful in there.  Ambiance: 5/5 (Vintage/ Romantic) Service: 3/5 (Slow) Food: 4/5 (good for bar snacks, don't come here hungry) Drinks: 4/5 (good coffee and cocktails) Value: 3/5 (can be expensive after a few drinks.)"}
{"text":"Normally I'm an East End bon vivant slash functioning alcoholic but my friend Lorraine suggested we check this new place out as it is owned by the original creators of her favourite downtown restaurant, the Gabardine, which is under new management. A few weeks ago, after watching a crushing Blue Jays versus Royals game, we decided to fly our broomsticks out west, ie. trundle along on the Gerrard streetcar to drown our sorrows and eat something delicious.   The Walton is the kind of bar that every neighbourhood should have. It's one of those places you could imagine a modern day Hemingway would hang out in...it's cozy, warm, and unpretentious with a nod to deco twenties style decor....or wait, was Hemingway himself pretentious? I read somewhere he was a bloated bore and liked to argue alot. Still, I could see myself having a torrid affair with him and we would hang out here and get slowly hard liquor hammered whilst having lively and incoherent discussions about boxing and World War 2 with the bartender. Toward the end of the evening, Ernie would slide his hand up my skirt and rub my thigh and that would the cue to leave and we would make out sloppily in the back of the Uber. But of course he'd be passed out by the time we got home and I'd have to carry his fat ass up to bed. But! In the morning I would make him a double Bloody Mary and he'd be good to go. Half mast, but still.  Anyway, back to real life, Lorraine and I always like to belly up to any given bar as opposed to the seated dining area because we like to chat. This place the sets the bar for bar banter, lol. Alison, the owner,  was our server and Stefan was the cook and the maker of pickled herring, and they suggested things that hit the spot. We had bourbon based cocktails and switched to a craft beer on tap, following the golden of beer before liquor, never sicker, liquor before beer, never fear. The Walton doesn't have a full-sized kitchen, but right at the bar, there is a prep area where things are heated in a super-high tech convection oven. We had yummy sausage rolls, pate, and a cheese and charcuterie platter, hit the spot. The whole evening was super fun, no arguing, just lots of laughs with great company. The west side is lucky to have this place!"}
{"text":"Cozy spot for working or even hanging out with friends (not more than two). Lovely people who provide you with blanket when it's cold!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing afternoon at the Walton soon after they opened. Great cocktails and solid food being served by passionate owners. We were told that the classic Nordic bites were derived from old family recipes, and everything that we ate was delicious."}
{"text":"We visited the Walton during the summer. We didn't have any food, and we drank only wine, so I can't comment on the cocktails, but this place gets five stars simply for having what must be one of the most charming and serene patios in Little Italy.  My friend and I just had dinner at Pinky's, which due to the lack of AC was sweltering hot, and we needed a cool and quiet place to have a few drinks.  This place was perfect."}
{"text":"My word if this place isn't the definition of charming. I finally made my way through the white doors of this College Street spot on a warm summer day last week and I can't wait to go back again asap. Let me count the ways:   + Extremely adorable back patio, complete with white folding chairs, wooden benches, twinkle lights, white paper lanterns, and dappled light provided by a number of leafy trees. + Delicious coffee. I had mine iced with almond milk because it was hella hot that day. + Big yummy pastries. I had an almond croissant that was so sweet and buttery and crispy and chewy. (These are dropped off fresh from The Tempered Room or Blackbird Baking daily.) + Really good cheese. My friend and I shared a selection of three, which came served with crostini, some grainy flatbread type crackers, apple slices, honey, and preserves.   The service is also lovely - kind and attentive but not pushy - and perfect for a drink and and chat with friends or an afternoon spent buried in your laptop. If only my home office was this cute, I'd probably never leave."}
{"text":"Such a beautiful space! Great drinks and such a great vibe overall. Their back patio is beautiful during the summer super cute spot."}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem.It also has the best  lattes in Toronto, no lie about that,  atmosphere is super cozy and welcoming, please try this place out you will not be disappointed!!  I guarantee you that!"}
