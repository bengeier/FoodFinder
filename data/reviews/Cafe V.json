{"text":"My parents took me out here last night to celebrate my birthday.  When we arrived the host was busy talking to other people and totally ignored us. After waiting 10 minutes someone finally showed up to seat us. After being seated we waited 10-15 more minutes and no one had showed up at our table to even give us a glass of water or take our drink orders. The place wasn't even busy -- more than half the tables were empty.  At this point we got up and left and went to another restaurant, so I can't say anything about the food. However I can say this place had the hallmark of a failing business -- they nickel and dime you to death. You get bread like all nice restaurants do, but if you want more after the initial plate you have to pay $2/plate. Really? I've never seen a charge for bread from the chainiest of chains up through the fanciest of places. If you want extra dressing for your salad it's 50¢. Again, what's the point? That just makes them look desperate. For the price of the meals if they can't afford to put extra dressing on your salad without charging, something is very wrong."}
{"text":"The decor is bit outdated.  If you go early evening during the summer, there is no way to escape the blazing sun, which I am sure becomes a beautiful view at other hours of the day/early evening.  The waiter was young, a little inexperienced, but well-trained to cater to the retirement crowd (affordable fine dining).  The portions were huge, the menu was interesting, but the execution was terrible.  The chicken cutlet was burnt and covered up by an excessive amount of cheese.  The veal francata was drowned in butter.  It was inedible.  When the waiter asked why it wasn't eaten, we politely told him about the butter.  He informed the chef, who completed the sentence when the waiter started to say the dish had too much butter.  Although he informed us that he followed up, there was no offer to remove from our check (we didn't ask either).  We will not return to Vic's.  We asked to meet the owner and everyone was covert about his whereabouts.  If I were him, I would spend more time teaching the chef the recipes and updating the place.  Unless they feel that they have a captive audience of retirees and do not need younger people like us to frequent the establishment.  Of course, with the heavy-handed amounts of butter and cheese, the youngest of arteries won't hold up long enough to return."}
{"text":"We had their Friday nightstand special, fish n chips for $9.99. Fish servings was skimpy. Batter was light n crispy but fish portion could have been a little larger. I ordered a bottle of Clos Du Bois chard n was charged $35.00 for this bottle. You can buy this bottle for $11.00 at the local grocery store. Beautiful location but over priced on the food n drinks. Their happy hour was ok Just had drinks n appetizers at the revere Grille n it was great. We will be back"}
{"text":"I have the luxury of living in the Anthem community which is the home of Vic's, and have dined there twice in the week it has been open, a soft-opening period, which means, in my opinion, that it shouldn't be judged too harshly. When the restaurant was operating under previous owners, it had been cited in the Las Vegas Review-Journal as having \"the best view in the Valley\" and as being \"the best place to take a date for dinner.\"  Vic Vegas (Moea) and his partners have invested a great deal of effort in creating a comfortable ambiance and designing a unique menu of items that are singular for area restaurants. We have very much liked the signature caramel pork chop with stuffing and a caramel-glazed apple, though this dish would probably not be suitable for diabetics. Three of us returned and made a meal out of the \"Tapetizer\" menu, including these excellent items: meat loaf spring rolls; salmon sliders; and lobster & chips, which is a whole Maine lobster tail, split and fried in a beer batter, accompanied by really good crinkle-cut fries.  Salads are also quite creative, including a field greens salad with \"BBQ blue cheese\" dressing that was bordering on spectacular.  Within the first few days, management listened to customer complaints about the dinner rolls and quickly switched to rolls that are soft and chewy on the inside, served warm."}
{"text":"We loved Chef Vic Vegas when he was on The Next Food Network Star and were ticked when he made his exit.  Back then we both knew we would have to hunt his restaurant down and try his food!  I read an article recently in the Las Vegas Review Journal about his restaurant at Sun City Anthem and at long last we are finally here!   From the warm friendly greeting to Rich, the  gregarious server it was an amazing experience even before the awesome food.  We started with the meatball spring rolls with pan gravy and ketchup aioli!  Deelish!   Next we had the house salad which normally would be boring anywhere else but I tried their BBQ bleu cheese dressing and OMG it was so good that  I used some of the bread at the table to scrape up every last drop!  Now onto to the entrees... Ken had the chicken parmesan.  The sauce was full of love and the chicken was so tender and juicy.  I had an amazing dish called Roughy Vin Bianco.  It was pan seared orange roughy with sautéed spinach.  It was so good with an amazing citrus sauce.  If I could have licked my plate clean in a public place I would have!!!!!!  We were both stuffed and happy but when Rich recommended Vic's take on PB&J he did not have to twist my arm very far!  We got to share five crispy delectable deep fried Nutter Butter cookies with a yummy Chambord reduction sauce to dip them into!!!  Plus we had a killer view of the mountains and Strip at sunset for under $70.00. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Party of six had dinner week of Feb.22. All six were very happy with dinner, service and pricing. Liver and onions were outstanding, others loved their hamburgers, fish and chips. Outstanding view just enhanced the experience. Friendly server Michael \"welcomed me back,\" from an earlier dining. Great people skills this guy has. Tony and Gerlinde"}
{"text":"Cafe Vic is a whole lot better than the old fancy Vic's, but the service is still terrible.  Waitress was lost, from the very start to the very end, extremely slow, she said she would be right back with the spoons for the soup, water, dessert menu, never once made it back had to ask the hostess and others to get.  Finally put the dirty salad and soup dishes on the table next to us where people had just left, because our entrees were served, but our salad and soup dishes though empty were not cleared."}
{"text":"Lousy thanksgiving dinner ever!! And found hair in my salad, cranberry sauce from a can."}
{"text":"Excellent food - Good service - Great view - Good size food portions - A excellent waiter by the name of Jennifer made a very good evening turn into an excellant evening of dining with friends on their first night in SCA."}
{"text":"Vic's has a great view.....that's it!!  Food is midiocre and service poor. Can't recommend and try them twice."}
{"text":"I took out of town guest there last month. Total embarrassment. The salmon was dry. The fish and chips was so small I thought it was a child's serving. I would never go again!"}
{"text":"It is so exciting to finally have an excellent restaurant up here in Anthem!  Vic Vegas and his team have really outdone themselves.  Although they are still in the soft opening phase, the service and quality of food are top notch.  The views from the restaurant are incredible looking over the valley .  Earlier in the week, we enjoyed dinner there with friends.  All of the appetizers were excellent!  Especially enjoyed the calamari and the black and blue sliders.  When you sit down, they say \"welcome home to Vic's....and that's exactly what you feel like.  The mixed drinks are excellent (interesting glassware, but it's fun)!!!.  Last night we tried their  onion/macaroni and cheese soup that was delicious.   We were  impressed with the service both nights we were there...Vic was walking around and checking on how things were going which is something that all restaurateurs should do. We wish them well in this new venture!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Tuesday. It was hard to find exactly where the restaurant was located and then when we found it, there was no one there to greet us. After waiting for a few minutes someone came to seat us. Service was very slow but kind and food was delicious! Great place for a yummy hot sandwich, burger, or salad!! Just make sure you are not constrained by time at all when you dine here. We will definitely be back and we are looking forward to trying dinner here soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I made reservations for Vic's Easter brunch. Our table was ready when we walked in, a nice table by the window with the great view.  Seafood selection was good. Service was friendly but somewhat slow to clear dishes and bring drinks.  I was surprised when we for our check that they had already \"added the tip\". Eighteen percent on the total cost which included the tax. I did not see this explained in the advertisement for the brunch and didn't feel they should have done this for a party of 2. Since it was a buffet and service wasn't great, I probably would have opted for 15 percent."}
{"text":"I am an Anthem resident and  happy to finally see an upper end resaurant.. I have had four dinners, one lunch and feel comfortable giving Vic's a 5 star. The food is excellent, service (better as they get out of the soft opening), dinner prices are mid-high but portions worth it.  Last dinner my wife and I had appertizers only and loved it.  We split 6 appetizers and highly recommend \"tapas\" style dining.  If you are seeking a bargain \"retiree, senior special\" restaurant this is not for you - go to a  casino buffett.  If you come to golf at Revere stop by for lunch instead of the golf course restaurant you will find better food and drinks.  Greg Y."}
{"text":"In a word: UNPROFESSIONAL.     It's Saturday afternoon at 1:30, when we arrive at Vic's.  As we're walking into the building, the hostess (I realize it's the hostess when she would later seat us) is carrying two trays of Starbucks.  My first thought is, 'The coffee must suck if the restaurant employees are getting their coffee elsewhere'.   After the hostess distributes the Starbucks coffee to her fellow employees, she comes back to the entrance of the restaurant and seats us.  Including our table of two, there are three other tables occupied; two tables with two people and one table with a party of five or six (a dozen people total), so it was not busy.    Our waitress (Cindy, I think), brings us some water while we decide what to order.  After taking our order, my husband decides to order a beer.  The waitress proceeds to read off the draft beers from a handwritten piece of paper.  My husband chooses a beer, then Cindy says, \"Sorry, we are out of that one\".  So, my husband makes another decision, to which the waitress says again, \"Sorry, we are out of that one, too\".  My husband finally says, \"Why don't you just tell me what you DO have\".  After deciding on a beer that is available, he waits.  And waits.  And waits.     In the meantime, I see another waitress walk out of the kitchen with a newborn baby in her arms!  I mean, WTF??  I'm sure that's against some health code or regulation.  The baby holding waitress walks over to the table of five/six people and passes the baby to a guy sitting over there.  The guy gets up, looks at a young woman who is eating and says, \"Enjoy your lunch, I will change the baby\" and heads off to the restroom.    After 20 minutes, we ask our waitress, Cindy, \"Can we get the beer\"?  She kind of giggles and says, \"Oh sorry, our bartender just had a baby, so we were passing it (the baby) around.  I will go get your beer now\".  I see and hear our waitress ask the hostess if she can pour a draft beer.  Obviously, the hostess is not schooled in beer pouring, because we ended up having to wait until the guy (who I now realize is the bartender) gets back from changing his baby's diaper.  Um, gross.  At that point, we got up and walked out.     Having seen Vic on 'The Next Food Network Star', I was really excited that he had chosen to open a restaurant in my community, and I was really looking forward to it being my new 'go to' place.  Needless to say, I was more than disappointed with the complete lack of professionalism from the staff.  I can not comment on the quality of the food nor beer, since we left after 30 minutes, which was before either was served.  Like I said, the place was not crowded, so I don't know what was taking so long to prepare two sandwiches.  I shutter to think that the delayed food preparation may have been in part due to the kitchen staff 'passing the baby around'.  If Vic and his partner want to make this restaurant a success, they will either need to 'be hands on' in this restaurant or re-evaluate their current staff.       I am so sad, I really wanted to like this place.  Oh well, Buckman's Grill next door always satisfies."}
{"text":"Couldn't be happy from the start. My husband went to make a reservation and they use some kind of email form so you have to wait to hear back if your reservation is accepted. Kind of reminds me of the 1980's. So he sent the note stating we would go else ware as we could not wait and suggested they look at real time reservations online. Here was the response from the GM... Then my recommendation would be that you call. We have no need for open table as we are a local business. NOT a chain. It works out anyway because I'm full at the time slot you requested. I hope you try us out another time. Have a wonderful day.   We are so insulted that his response was so distant from what diners do this day with technology. So needless to say we will not be ever going here ever. To all who read this, you have sen warned!"}
{"text":"Wow. 2nd time at Vic's, but this time, thought I'd try the bar and appetizers.  Bartender was hard to find, but eventually showed up from the kitchen.  I ordered a Manhattan, straight up. His response was to ask me what brand of Scotch I wanted!   I asked for Rye and he finally got it sorted.  Drink was poorly done with mini ice cubes in it.  Isn't this a supposed to be a hospitality town??    Thought I'd try an appetizer to check the kitchen again. I ordered the truffled ravioli.  20 minutes later, no bartender, no ravioli.  During my wait, a lady arrived at the bar and ordered a martini. Bartender said two minutes and proceeded to leave the bar and not return for 15 minutes.  No apology or anything to the customer.  Ravioli arrived, lukewarm, but overdone at the edges. Microwaved?  Bartender eventually had to return, inquired about my ravioli.  When I told him it wasn't hot, we parted company.  He brought the check and I left.  No tip ..never to return. AND I live in SCA.    I'd prefer a burger and beer location vs. this pretention."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best restaurant! !! Try the caramel pork chop & lobster.. the view is spectacular."}
{"text":"Came tonight wanting a steak but they were sold out!  The staff is great but, seriously, who does the buying here?  Ordered a hamburger instead.  It was fine but the baked potato was under cooked & cold.  They have some work to do here!"}
{"text":"Vics place is a gem. I highly recommend going around sunset the view is awesome. For an appetizer we ordered the steamed clams the flavor of the broth was great. For the main course my wife had the scallops and I had the beef short ribs. She let me try the scallops and they were great but the short ribs were of the charts. We will be returning thanks vic for a great night."}
{"text":"New to Vics, but loved it- We went on Valentines Day- so I have a few very minor \"complaints\": 1) There was a \"fixed\" menu, which were not aware of when we placed the reservation. We were looking forward to trying some items that actually weren't available that night because you had to order one of two \"packages\". 2)There was a server or busperson who kept running past our table into the kitchen. I was trying to unwind and relax, but every few minutes he literally ran past us! That was a bit unnerving! 3) The package we chose came with two glasses of house wine- we were never offered them, given them, or allowed a substitution. Not a big deal, but worth mentioning.  But, the rest of the experience was amazing- and I am very hard to please (see my other reviews) Calamari was outstanding- easily the best we have had---ever! Caesar Salad- dressing was amazing!!!  Filet cooked to perfection-  Just a great night-  Of course the view is another plus. We will definitely be back- cant wait!"}
{"text":"A Hidden Jem in the Henderson / Las Vegas area.  Tonight my wife and I went to Vics for the first time for our anniversary. We were greeted with a smile and sat in a booth with a fantastic view.  Our waitress (Jen) was very helpful, energetic, and continued to keep an eye on us as if we were special! We ordered drinks, an appetizer, salads and entrees.  Nothing over lapped! They came out one after another as they should! This is uncommon in most restaurants. She made sure our experience was enjoyable.  The food was fantastic! Spaghetti and Meatball was above and beyond, and the Short Rib was one of, if not the best I've ever had.   The prices were very reasonable and one of the owners came out to greet and welcome us and confirm that everything was perfect.   We will most certainly return soon!"}
{"text":"Great salmon burger and salad bar! Love the views! The service is also very good. Our waiter was very pleasant and attentive.  Prices are decent too."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure how I feel about Vic's. The restaurant is nestled deep in the heart of Anthem, and could prove hard to find if you are not a SCA resident. It is in the club house type building across the street from Walgreens. When we arrived it was eerily quiet outside -- my boyfriend said he felt as if he had just arrived to a Scientology compound. I concurred.  After slight wandering around inside of the building we found the restaurant. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and led to a table in the corner of the restaurant with a beautiful view of the city. Our server was great. He was attentive and friendly without being overbearing. I ordered a glass of red wine and they served us a bread basket with three fairly plain rolls and plain ol' butter. I would take out the bread basket altogether if unable to either spice up the rolls, or the butter. Or perhaps offer port wine cheese in addition to the butter.  As our appetizer we opted for the Black and Blue Sliders ($10). They were two sliders with beef tenderloin, bleu cheese, onion, arugula, tomato and garlic aioli. The taste was fine, but the meat was pretty tough. I wouldn't order these again.  The entree prices are reasonable for the amount and quality of food. The entrees range from $16 (Veggie Lasagna) all the way to $38 (rack of lamb). I was in a mood for a salad, so I selected the Warm Spinach salad ($11), boyfriend went with the Salmon ($22). The salad was fine and very rich. The portion did justify the price. I felt the vinaigrette was a little overpowering. The salmon was pretty straight forward. It was a generous portion and it was cooked just right.   The food was fine, but as a non SCA resident I wouldn't rush back here. I would have preferred to see a smaller, more refined menu and bigger taste. The items were just a-ok."}
{"text":"Went back to Vics Aug 2 and for some reason, their food was greasy and thickly battered. My friend tried their lobster dish. Fried and mediocre tasting. Then she had their nutterbutter dessert - wow!! It was like biting into an object that served as a receptacle for oil. Dipped into some sweet sauce that made me want to hit somebody! It was soooo sweet.... We also ordered from the appetizer some kind of rolls. I think it was meat loaf batter they wrapped in rice paper (or something similar) and served with 2 dipping sauces. One was tasteless and the other was good. I had the spaghetti with meatballs. The order was huge and the meatballs are made from the same batter for their meat loaf dish."}
{"text":"Went here with the family not expecting much, and came away extremely impressed and very full. What is a foodie restaurant doing in Sun City Anthem? All of the menu items were unique and different in some way, and everything tasted delicious.  Some of the innovative items on this menu included a Mac N Cheese French Onion Soup, Caramel Apple Pork Chop and Spaghetti that included one 11 oz behemoth of a meatball. The house salad dressing contained reduced grape soda and an appetizer contained meatloaf wrapped inside of a spring roll. Not your run of the mill fine dining menu.  Aside from the wonderful food, the place is beautiful. A gorgeous view overlooks the entire city and the glasses, silverware and everything else were modern and cutting edge.  On top of everything else, the food wasn't too overpriced. I have dined at many nice restaurants where salad isn't included with entrees, which was not the case here. Vic's provided us with a reasonable priced meal at an above average eatery. I would dine here again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"We wanted to try someplace local and thought we would give Cafe V one more try. Sunday night and 7 PM, there were only 3 people in the bar (doing paper work and not really drinking) and one couple finishing a meal - otherwise completely empty. A very depressing ambiance. I asked our server if there were any specials. She let us know that not only were there no specials, but usual limited menu was even more limited on Sunday. The menu she brought had only 2 entrees, two hamburgers, and two pastas and the option for a salad bar (the salad bar was the saddest version of a salad bar that I have ever seen).  I understand their problem. It's hard to justify buying lots of fresh food to serve when you know there will be a very poor turnout. On the other hand, it's hard to get a good turnout when you are offering almost no interesting meal options. I certainly will never go back on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Fantastic view. Very slow service.   Crisp, fresh Caesar Salad.  Yummy Meat Loaf in Won Ton Wrappers (like egg rolls),  Delicious Short Ribs."}
{"text":"Best place in all of Vegas! amazing views of the city.Exceptional food, staff and service. Vic, the head chef, Gigi and her husband have all become some of my favorite people! My fiance and I are planning our 2014 wedding there and every single time I arrive, I feel like family!  Love this place!! Best kept secret in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome view and awesome service from Jennifer. We had steak, ribs and shrimp with drinks and it was a great night!"}
{"text":"Terrific. From salad, through entrees, and dessert.  Fresh crisp Caesar. Outstanding spaghetti with \"6 hour\" marinara - it said on the menu. Topped off by a massive homemade meatball. Excellent.  Huge serving.   Finished meal with maybe the best apple tart we have ever had. No puff pastry cheap knockoff. This was beautifully assembled and baked pie/pastry dough (probably started as a pate brisee) filled with nicely cooked apples. Ala mode of course with a drizzle of caramel sauce. Oh yeah...  BTW took half the spaghetti home. Made two meatball sandwiches for us and there is more left in the fridge. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fine dining at affordable prices says it all! Underline the words \"fine dining\" and \"affordable\" because they mean it. A few months ago, I took my girlfriend here for her Birthday dinner and we had a flawless experience. The atmosphere, the service, the prices and definitely the food were all top notch. Even the portions they served were more than satisfying. No complaints at all.  For an appetizer, we ordered the Shortyz (which is the appetizer version of their \"Short Ribs\"). They were so damn good that I decided to order the entrée version for my main dinner course. She chose the Caramel Apple Pork Chop, which was also delicious, but didn't exactly melt in my mouth the way the short ribs did.   Since it was a birthday dinner, the assistant manager (I forgot his name, I just know he was tall and wore glasses... friendly guy!) had us pick a full-sized dessert of her choice. Free of charge!  The bottom line: I seriously have nothing bad to say about this place. Considering the prices, it's the best food I've ever had in Vegas, period.  P.S. I've read a lot of reviews from people complaining about Vic's location (Sun City Anthem, inside a Recreation Center, which is actually very nice). Yeah, I can see why people would be questioning its location, but once you're inside the restaurant, all that \"questioning\" goes out the door. If you're still not happy with the location, here's some advice to you: Go to Roy's, spend double the money on smaller portions and enjoy driving around that hectic side of town. Also, be sure to have a few dollar bills with you, just in case a homeless guy hounds you for money. More Vic's for me."}
{"text":"Where do I begin...Went there last night - a Saturday night BTW -  waited at the hostess stand for at least a good 5 minutes, none ever showed up. The entire time didn't see a bartender at the bar. One couple was sitting there having a glass a wine. Didn't see a waiter walking around, only about 4 table in the entire restaurant (my husband decided to walk around). We ended up leaving. Poor, poor first impression. How do you run a business like that? Sorry Vic but I'll never go back."}
{"text":"What a view!  Man, I guess that is the view everyone in Henderson or Seven Hills wants.  The valley and the Strip are gorgeous.  Went for lunch with a business partner.  Food was good.  Hardly anyone in the place, hope they survive.  Food's OK, and the view!  Service was friendly and good.  Did I tell you about the view?  WOW."}
{"text":"I had met Vegas Vic at the Bite of Las Vegas in 2012, where he was making a NutterButter, dipped in Pancake Mix, Orange Soda, Deep Fried, and served with a Chambord Raspberry dipping sauce.  I was one of the volunteers who had a chance to try it.  It was delicious.  I had seen Vic's billboards off of the 215 by Eastern and another one by the M Resort off of the 15 South, so I was tempted to go check it out.    First off, Vic's is located in Anthem, which is a retirement community in Henderson.  It is very far from the strip, but not too far if you live on that side of town.  Literally, the restaurant is inside the community center.  There is no frontage, no free standing building, and can be hard to find.  You can ask anyone who is walking around where it is and they will point you in the right direction.  Second, the food was fantastic.  Vic's has a relatively small menu, but everything was unique, American inspired, and looked good.  Unlike most Vegas restaurants, all of Vic's entrees come with a house or Caesar salad.  The food was reasonably priced for fine dining and was packed with flavor.    Pros: Great food, great view, friendly staff, relatively inexpensive for the quality of food Cons: In a retirement community center, all other patrons are 60+, far away from society  I see myself going back to Vic's if I am in the area golfing or end up looking for a place to get dinner before heading to the M Resort or Green Valley for a night out."}
{"text":"We finally got inside Vic's!  The last time we trekked up the mountain to try this place, they were closed.  They have early hours here, so make sure the place is open when you drive up.  They close early!  Our service and food was superb!  Paul and I took friends to this place that were visiting from Oregon.  They said it reminded them of their country club in Medford.  The place has a country club type of setting.  It is part of a community center.  GO TRY VICS!  You will love the food!  The portions were large too!  We all ended up taking food home to eat as leftovers."}
{"text":"They have a summer menu with about six items on it, no more.  The items were hamburger, two standard fish items (salmon but I don't recall the other) a couple sandwiches and that was about it.  No steaks, no seafood, no lamb and there may have been one chicken item.  When we first sat down, the bartender came to our table as she doubled as both server and bartender.  I asked for an Absolut on the rocks, they don't have Absolut either.  Didn't matter, we left.  That cut the number of people at a dinner table by 50% at six thirty in the evening on a Sunday.  It cut the number of people in the entire place by 33% as there were a couple people at the bar.  Looks like we aren't the only ones who found this place to be nothing close their webpage or advertisements. Change isn't always good and in their case, probably fatal."}
{"text":"I'm here visiting my cousin for the weekend and he had mentioned that there's a new place that he wants us to try.  Cafe V has an amazing view and everyone was very nice including the co-owner Scott was very welcoming!  That's not all...............the best part of the evening...........was the food........it was E X C E L L E N T!!!!!!!  From ordering appetizers such as the friend green beans with the yummy sauce, potato skins to our main courses, everything was super delicious!  If you like your burgers juicy and tasty, I suggest ordering the V Burger...it's mouthwatering!  The open face roast beef sandwich was also to die for!  I'm going back to Vegas for my birthday next month with my girlfriends and this is the place to be.  I will definitely for sure come back!  Love love love this place....best friendly service and the most Yummy, Delicious, Excellent, Super D Duper great tasting food ever!  I highly recommend that you all try this place....you will never be disappointed I guarantee you!  You will come out of there smiling and wanting to come back for more, cuz I sure do!!!!"}
{"text":"Dear Vic,  I brought three friends to Cafe V  for lunch today and while you seem to have a four star rating I could only give it three stars.  I ordered the liver and onions and while the flavor was great and the liver was very tender, it was the thinnest piece of liver I've ever seen in my life.   The baked potato that my friend and I had came with margarine. Margarine? Really Vic? Who uses margarine especially in a restaurant of this caliber? My friends Chicken Piccata  was excellent so no complaints there. The other diner's Salisbury steak looked  like and, she said tasted like canned gravy.  The coffee was served with 2% milk. Vic, come on - 2% milk? Whole milk would've been bad enough. I don't think I've ever had anything but cream in a restaurant in 20 years. The service was outstanding, I wish I could remember the server's name. Very personable, very efficient and did her job well. That's why I gave it three stars along with the fact that the dinners were pretty good.   So how about you pop for butter, real butter, and cream for the coffee? It just might bring me back again.   Sorry Vic I wish I could've given this five stars  like I did when we came to VICS American cuisine. That was definitely five stars.  Maybe I'll give this another try in a couple of months."}
{"text":"Vic's is awesome. My wife had the rack of lamb and I had the pork chop. The pork chop was AMAZING and during the hours of 5-7 it was only $20 with a salad and chocolate cake. The chop may be the best I've ever had; with a delicious honey whisky glaze. The lamb was good as well, although it didn't compare to the chop. My wife also ordered the cheesecake on a stick...delicious.   Our waiter was very friendly. My only negative is that it's located in the Sun City Anthem Country Club. I feel bad for them that their main clientele will be retired people who like to complain. In fact the old couple sitting in at the table next to us pissed us off by commenting on everything we ordered."}
{"text":"The wait staff was awesome, the view was spectacular and the food was superior.  The menu has a few items that make you chuckle, yet want to try.  Everything I have had there is great, It is a 40 minute drive for me, but I make the drive for their food, and the best Deep-fried Nutta Buttas! You get best of both worlds, the atmosphere says \"Formal\", the wait staff says \"your family and this is home\""}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE WAS GREAT!!!  SERVICE GREAT!!!  FOOD AND WINE....TERRIBLE!!! if you have to go there TAKE YOUR OWN WINE....and ask for a stem glass, otherwise you get a water or juice glass.  Do not order the Caesar salad, we were told the kitchen REFUSES to cut up the romaine or to split that salad.  The main courses were only 1/2 bad due to over cooking....The \"loaded baked potato\" came without some of the what is was to be loaded with so I asked that they bring it to me and a tiny bit of chives came in a medicine cup of the smallest possible size.  The bread could not be chewed as the crust was like leather.  Parking is not good and there is no valet...so \"gentlemen\" drop your date at the door and then park....only 3 handicapped spots.  When children misbehave or a baby continually screams a normal person would leave the restaurant but when then don't, I expect the management to handle the situation....they did not handle it last night and we had 2 ;hours of screaming.    If the food was good then I would say the prices are fair.....now that is the best thing I can say about Vic's."}
{"text":"Latest visit.. had the salisbury steak and vegetable lasagna.. both were very good.. and for $13.99 each, hard to beat. Add $3.00 glasses of decent house wines, and you walk away satisfied at a very reasonable cost. It is a bit up the road, but considering the overall experience, well worth the few minutes drive. Seriously for the view alone... just go."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!! Great food (have the ravioli appetizer) and great service!!! They have an amazing view, so be sure to book your reservation around sunset.  My husband had the short rib and it was quite tasty!! Also, the Caesar salad was presented in a unique manner (I really liked their plating method). As for the side dishes, they do a great job with mashed potatoes. Enjoy!!!!!"}
{"text":"Giving them 5 stars because we really enjoyed everything about this place.   The food is reasonably priced. The ambiance is fantastic. And the service is great! (Sit outside....the view is beautiful).   We ordered the chicken dish and the spaghetti dish, with a side of Mac & cheese.   The dinner salads come complimentary with the meal and are a great size. Their choice of dressings is fantastic (try the grape vinaigrette).   The Mac and cheese was delicious, as were our meals. The meatball with the spaghetti is huge! The chicken dish come with a Thai chili sauce that tastes fantastic.   Our bill was less than $50. Can't beat that for a great meal with a great view.   We will most definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great view of the strip from the top of Anthem. Restaurant is located in a fancy senior center, catering towards the seniors so the place closes at 9 pm and plays slow jams from the 1950-1960's. Food reasonably priced and reasonably delicious. Wish this place was more busy and play more upbeat music, felt like I was in a Steven King movie."}
{"text":"So sorry ordered the prime rib special and cane out bloody rare asked for medium rare. No problem sent it back and was medium on return. Unfortunately there was more waste than edible. Well this unfortunately happens with the best. This will not stop us from coming back because of our waiter Mike. He impressed us so much for apologizing. I said Mike you're not the chef. The manager comped our meal which was not expected so we were very impressed. We shall definitely return. Everyone has bad days. But thanks to our enthusiastic waiter Mike made up for the evening.  Thank you Mike"}
{"text":"There's an old saying that if you screw me once, shame on you.  Screw me twice, shame on me.  This is definitely shame on me.  Went back there tonight after getting a coupon in the mail.  When I mentioned to the manager who seated us that we haven't been back since they opened, he proudly told us that the service has gotten much better.  It took about 7 minutes after we were seated for a server to show up.  We gave him our entire order.  40 minutes later absolutely nothing.  No bread, no salad, no entrée.  On top of that, some (outgoing) employee was swearing at a customer at the next table threatening to beat them up in the parking lot.  That's when we decided to leave.  Last time it took a long time to get our food.  This time we didn't even get any food.  I didn't think they could possibly do any worse.  Apparently I was wrong.  The manager did offer me 2 free entrees the next time.  I don't think I'll be going back for a 3rd time."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in Southern Nevada. Don't let the location fool you. We're a late 20s couple and have still turned this into one of our go-to date night spots. The food is always outstanding, and the service is incredible too. Be sure to ask for Rich when you're in there - he's hilarious and always delivers great service.  As for the menu, it's a food lover's paradise. Everything is home style basics done at the top of the game, usually with a twist. The meatloaf and brown gravy is already outstanding, but they take it a step further by reimagining it as an eggroll with two dipping sauces.  We usually get several appetizers, and then struggle over which entree to get because they're all so good. I usually do the short ribs, and my fiancée does the chicken franchetta. Both awesome. Last night I ventured into the scallops and they were amazing.   And don't forget the view. You can see the entire valley, and at night it's gorgeous!  I can't speak highly enough about this place. An absolute must try for locals looking for the next great date spot.   Thanks a truly awesome valentines dinner. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Vic's since they opened. It is a beautiful setting and at first the food and service was excellent.  Each time I have come the food and the service has diminished and I expect that it won't be long before their doors close. Today I took out-of-town guests for lunch. The  lunch menu is very limited and everything we asked for, the waiter stated they were out of.  The box lunch type  sandwich took 30 minutes to arrive.  It was dry and really not worth the wait.  They may just want to close their doors for lunch . You would be better off going to a fast food restaurant then to Vic's."}
{"text":"Took the family to Vic's for a Birthday Dinner. 2 of us had the Seafood Stroganoff and another Filet Mignon and Baked Potato.  The meal was fabulous, presentation, preparation and aviance were superb.  The service (Kevin was our waiter) was very good and attentive.  This is high end restaurant with a fabulous view of Las Vegas and is located in the Sun City Anthem Center."}
{"text":"Ribeye special - meat, potato, side veggie, salad bar.  $13.99.   Looked like a slice of prime rib was cut and put on the griddle.  Not a lot of traffic in the place, though it has a great setting with leather booths, view of LV, nice happy hour.   Meat was 1/3 to 1/4 inedible gristle or fat, not juicy like a ribeye after resting.  Broccoli was cool, fries were good, but about 10% were burnt.    This place has a lot of good reviews - I'll probably try it again, but not order what I had."}
{"text":"Really beautiful nighttime view of the city. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were up in Anthem, hungry and looked on Yelp.  This place had decent ratings so we decided to give it a shot.  It is part of the golf course and for a restaurant it was ok but nothing that great that would make us drive out of our way to get here.  The service was ok, a little on the slow side but the server was very friendly and did the best she could.  There were a few tables and for a little bit she was the only server taking care of all the tables...why at lunch time would they do this???    You had a choice of a self serve soup and salad bar or you could order off the menu.  We chose to order off the menu and it took forever for the food to come out.  First we ordered the potato skins which the menu said was covered in bacon, green onion and cheese.  When they finally arrived they did have cheese on them but very little of anything else which was disappointing.   The ranch that came with them was not that great.  As for the rest of the food, the salmon was ok and the burger was fine but again nothing spectacular.  It seemed more like bar food then a very nice Café portrayed in the pictures.  If you are in the area, this is a safe place to eat, but don't expect your food to come out fast because it will take a very long time...longer then a normal place for sure.  The only good thing is they have a bar so you can forget how long you are waiting if you put down a couple drinks."}
{"text":"My wife and I just ate at Vic's. We ordered off the Early Bird menu and got the 15 percent Anthem's  discount. The bar clerk was great. My wife had the pork chop and it was very good, however I was not so lucky with the short rib. It came out cold, which was hard to understand since it was charred. The potatoes were colder, so I ask if this was correct, they said no and redid my meal and got it to me in time for me to finish along with my wife. Even so, I was not impressed with my meal, but it is hard to do much with short ribs, that I could not do at home. Now having said all this, one day we will go back for the view and the chops."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this more.  Unfortunately it was somewhat mediocre.  Holiday dinner had a lovely setting, with pleasant table setting.  Was mystified by a small dollop of canned cranberry sauce on a large saucer at our table seating of four.  The meal was standard fare but uninspiring as it was served barely warm.  The green bean dish was cool and curdled.  The turkey was sliced from a 'loaf'.  The dressing was a ice cream scoop form and somewhat dry.  The water was iced.  But they must have run out of filtered water by the end of dinner.  The choice of dessert was either pumpkin or apple pie that you might find delivered from any grocery store.  The eggnog, I was told, was very good.  I am not inclined to come again as there are so many places to choose from in our area."}
{"text":"Although the wait staff and view are very appealing I found the food to be \"average\" especially considering the cost.  We went to Mother's Day brunch which was $26 for a buffet spread that was less than average.  I would probably not go back again."}
{"text":"Well I am bummed I have to write this review; what a total let-down.   Let me note before starting: Vic Vegas is an excellent chef and is no longer associated with the cafe.   I am not sure when Vic parted ways with this spot but my assumptions are that it has fallen apart ever since.   I gave one star because the view is incredible and because of the view there really is a ton of potential. WE DIDN'T EVEN STAY TO EAT OR GET SEATED. Maybe it's no longer meant for regular dining and only for larger parties?  I was super excited to check out this place but was hesitant because I knew Vic Vegas was no longer associated but I heard excellent things when he was. I figured they stuck with what worked  and somewhat stayed the same; well they didn't. I should have known because throwing 'cafe' in the name of your restaurant typically makes it extremely casual.   It was my turn to do date night; I was dressed up and couldn't wait to surprise my boyfriend with a new restaurant known for it's view.   We drove around in circles for over ten minutes trying to make sure we were in the right spot considering it looks like a college/business/event center area. The only sign on the main road is a dark sign saying 'restaurant open to the public'. So we park and walk in, still no restaurant sign guiding us on where to go. There was a wedding in one of the ball rooms so we ask a few people if they know where the restaurant is, they direct us to a bar/dining area with bright lighting and not a soul in the place (not one customer or table filled), not even a hostess or a server. Yes it was a Sunday night but I am wondering if they are even open for business; they were. We stood towards the front podium for over ten minutes waiting for someone to greet us (mind you, it's 6:20pm, mid dinner time). A guy from the wedding party passes us walking towards the bar and finally a employee walks out behind the bar eating her own food then looks up and asks the guy what she do for him. At this point I am anxious, flustered, and nervous about the service and possibility of stale/bad food (considering they were so slow). The lady doesn't even make eye contact with us so my boyfriend looks at me and says \"are you sure..?\" I decide no, let's go somewhere else.   We did a staycation at M resort hotel (fantastic place) and I actually even tried to call and make a reservation the day before at the Cafe but got no answer (6pm if when I called, on a Saturday) and left a voice mail; got no call back regarding my reservation.   So I am incredibly disappointed in this place and don't even get to yelp about the food. I am more flustered with myself for getting so excited about the place and giving it a shot after there were several signs not to.   Probably won't go back which sucks because it looks like a beautiful place to wine and dine. Maybe more of a lunch spot and I can check it out if I ever am in the area mid-day.   Get some better marketing and focus on the service Cafe V."}
{"text":"I've been very critical of Cafe ? as Vic Vegas is no longer associated. Last week, our dinner was just so-so. However, yesterday, I had a quite respectable lunch of liver & onions. \"Liver& onions?\" Yes, the liver was tender, the onions freshly sauteed to just-tender, tasty gravy and ample fresh steamed broccoli and green beans. My Mom would approve. If the expectations are kept in check, Cafe? will do for now. I hope they steady the ship of state."}
{"text":"This place is an expensive joke, for the 55+ Community of Anthem / SunCity. Who's brilliant idea was it, to put this place inside the Anthem Center? Hello?? 55+ and older live here and a majority of them don't wanna hang out, that serves the kind of food this place does.  They want something that resembles a 50's style place, like Ruby's Diner, or a Johnny Rockets.  A place that serves great breakfast too, at a great price.  Too bad that no one was smart and logical enough to do just that!  Vic's 50's Diner, sounds more appealing and attractive! Could have been decorated amazing and done amazingly well in profits!  Too bad!"}
{"text":"Nice place, good food, great atmosphere and view.  Hopefully this is the beginning of other establishments in the area. I only wish the prices were better and lately they have been charging for extra condiments (salad dressing,etc)  Its a shame because this will hurt the business.  Perhaps they are struggling to stay open? But that's not the way to do it.  I hope they learn a new formula"}
{"text":"As a last minute plan my girlfriend and I decided to check out Vic's restaurant on Saturday night.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Caramel Apple pork Chop.  It was placed over a bed of stuffing and topped with a caramel roasted apple and a whiskey butter sauce.  Melted in my mouth.  Kevin, our server, was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu.  Armed with a couple of glasses of wine and the Las Vegas valley night as a back drop it could not have been more romantic.  The food, service and view were all amazing.  kudos to Vic for creating such a great ambiance.  Can't wait to return with friends and try the other mouth watering dishes."}
{"text":"A gem in a very odd location, although it has a fantastic view at night. I've been there twice now and everyone had excellent food at every course. The first time I went I wasn't sure if I was going to play cards at the senior center or go to dinner. Once in the small but pleasant space, we had good service and delicious food. As long as the food continues to be well above average and surprisingly delicious, I'll be going back. It's strip food with local prices."}
{"text":"Wow - what a fantastic restaurant! Went there tonight with the family and this is one of the best restaurants ever! The food was absolutely AMAZING, the view is spectacular and the service was fantastic. We ordered the braised beef ribs, which were served over puree turnips with a balsamic reduction sauce, topped with crunchy onions. YUMMY! I ordered thai chicken which was by-far the BEST CHICKEN  I EVER TASTED - it was served over sweet potato hash, along with pureed sweet potatoes. My daughter also had a side order of mac n cheese and once served, she did not speak throughout the entire dinner, she was too busy eating. Our dessert was something that I have never tasted before - nutter butter cookies, dipped in orange soda pancake mix and served with raspberry chambord. The cheesecake is dipped in chocolate, served with vanilla cream, caramel and raspberry sauce. HMM HMM GOOD! Peanut butter and jelly for adults.   On your way to Vegas, make sure you stop at Vic's!!"}
{"text":"Vic's is far from the strip, and honestly far from almost anything, but totally worth the drive. It's inside of a golf club, so it's a little hard to find, but the food is amazing! They have a unique take on standard fare and I loved it. Had meatloaf spring rolls which were sooo good, and the watermelon caprese which is out of this world!!!! A must get. Tried a few entrees and left here stuffed to the brim.    The view is worth the drive alone. Get here before sunset and you have an amazing view of the entire city. So cool."}
{"text":"We had a party of 7 people there Friday night. Most of us had the salad bar and fish and chips special. Best fish and chips I have ever had. Salad bar - nice fresh lettuce and items to put in the salad. Live it. One person had liver and onions  -  Thought it was really good. Great service and the view of Vegas Valley is unmatched - incredible! Great value!"}
