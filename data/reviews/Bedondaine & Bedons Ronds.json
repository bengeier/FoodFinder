{"text":"Whether you're a denizen of charming Chambly or merely passing through it would behoove you to set aside a nice chunk of time to get pleasantly soused in this microbrewery/de facto beer museum. At any given time they have about 10-15 of their exceptional homebrews on tap, and with plush couches, friendly staff/regulars, and gazillions of bottles, brewing paraphernalia and bits of kitsch hanging about, you will find it all too easy to while away hours here.   We arrived after a late brunch at Fourquet Fourchette (very close in proximity), and were immediately enchanted by the puckish eclecticism among the brews here, what with ingredients such as spruce and coriander popping out from various written descriptions. For such potentially disastrous combinations though, there was a refined cleanliness to the complexity of every beer sampled, and not a one didn't go down as smoooooth as silk. This is a quality operation. I especially enjoyed my flirtation with the spicy minx known as the Ensorceleuse, and have only the highest praise for the oak barrel aged Tonique. Their oatmeal stout, the name of which at that point I didn't have the presence of mind to scrawl down, was voluptuously chewy and malty.   Other pluses: cute/affable/knowledgeable barkeeps, excellent music selections, free wifi, modest but tasty menu, beer events, free parking lot across the street. Go with some French handy in your back pocket."}
{"text":"Great place. Amazing beer!!!! Do I really need to say more?"}
{"text":"Endroit unique, très accueillant et confortable. Excellente bière artisanale."}
{"text":"We sampled everything on the menu.  That's EIGHTEEN beers.  And only two were bitter and undrinkable.  A lovely comfortable friendly space just outside of Montreal.  The food is basic and will fill you up nicely - we had sandwiches on nice crunchy baguettes.  The most remarkable finds were not one but TWO beers flavored with mint - and it WORKS.  Vermont brewers need to pay attention.  There is some truly creative stuff going on here!"}
{"text":"After crushing lunch over at Fourquet Fourchette, we dropped by B&BR for some more beering. Walls and walls and shelves of beer history are displayed in this quirky little spot.    We thought this would just be a museum tour, to check out all the international bottles and cans, coasters, bar towels, and trays but they also brew their own beer!   The outdoor patio was jam packed, and it was a beautiful day. But we wanted to head inside and check out the collection. Boy, what a collection. Beers from everywhere, full series, unique cans and labels. Books, posters, and some oversized couches and plenty of tables and chairs for what I presume is a great night in for those days when the patio isn't an option.  We had fun talking with the staff, who were all a lot more chatty and friendly than Fourquet Fourchette's overall staff (not that they were unfriendly or anything) and we got a real sense of their pride not only about the collection but the beers.  We sat and leafed through the binder, and read books about microbreweries in Quebec and enjoyed our visit. We weren't hungry for food, but the little chocolates were a nice choice to go with the beer. Unfortunately I don't know the names of each beer we had, and the website is incomplete.  We needed to make our way to Vermont, so our stay was truncated. I am looking forward to another visit one day."}
{"text":"Very cool place with a super chill small town vibe (almost shockingly so when arriving from rush hour Montréal). They have enough beer selections to make a binder. I tried the maple beer (forgot what the name was), but it was very sweet, not very carbonated, and a round taste. I prefer Le Grimoire's Désérables, but this one had some knack too. Food choice is limited. Excellent for passing by."}
{"text":"What a great place to relax and try a sudsy adult beverage.  Great and friendly service.  Very good selection of craft brew.  The food menu is light, but better than most micro-breweries.  They have sandwiches and snacks.  I tried a selection of 5 oz. tastes; I am a fan. Some of the best craft beers that I've tried.  I will certainly be back.  eh."}
{"text":"La bière est bonne! le service est impécable, Mais la nourriture est Ordinaire.. Pour une belle soirée entre amis c'est un endroit idéal."}
{"text":"Awesome microbrewery in Chambly, next to Unibrouie. Unibrouie us a classic and a must do, but this bar/ brewery is also a must do/visit. Half-bar-museum, half amazing craft brewer. The variety of beer styles available are excellent and very different from Unibrouie . Definitely a destination to come visit and worth a drive from Montreal!  World-class quality."}
{"text":"Bière artisanal unique, endroit unique et gens unique!! Que de positif pour cette endroit!"}
{"text":"After biking for a couple hours from Montreal to Chambly and exploring the beautiful old fort and the paths along the rapids we were well ready for a beer and the yelps led us straight to this tiny excellent microbrewery. We sat in big wooden Adirondack chairs in the sun and read from the great big beer menu binders around and wandered through the small bar checking out the thousands of beer bottles from all around the world. The staff were super nice and smart and friendly and easygoing in French and English and the local regulars were awesome to stop a while and chat with. We didn't eat so I can't comment on that, but I loved this little bar."}
{"text":"Wow I'm sure this place is MUUUUUUCH better, but I went here after we spent the day over at the Chambly beer fest, we just wanted to have a beer and a bite to eat after drinking beer all day long : )  Food: To make a long story short, the nachos which were pretty $$$ was nothing more than multi coloured nacho chips with cold toppings that came out of a jar.  The beer on tap was not even cold.   I realize the pub was probably involved with the beer fest that was going on, but Wow... I was not impressed.  I'm sure this was a fluke and would be willing to try them again, but first impressions don't leave expectations particularly high."}
