{"text":"Sir Pizza is very hit or miss.   First off, I would like to say that if you are a traditional Italian, Sir Pizza is like a mortal sin. Instead of the common round pie with the  large triangular slices, they have a round pie with small square-like slices. You can see a picture of this somewhere on the page. Anyway, that is my fair warning before info into the pros, cons, and neutrals.  Pros: Sir Pizza is very unique. The pizza's toppings are shredded onto the pizza. I have never seen this before so I thought I should mention it. Also, if you bring along the kiddies, they have these retro Pac-Man and Dig-Dug arcade games. They do cost quarters, but I think it is worth it to keep you preoccupied. They have a party room as well for special occasions. Finally, it is overall cheap.  Cons: The place is usually packed with people. You will wait a long time to get the pizza(s) you ordered. There are no waiters at Sir Pizza. You order at the counter what you want, sit down and wait. They do not have any dessert items to server either. The closet thing you can have to a treat after pizza is getting some cheap donut at the convienent store next door.   Neutrals: The sauce on the pizza is very sweet. I know this would be a big turn-off or turn-on for people so I just put it here. Lastly, the do serve things like hoagies, but they are very run of the mill. If you ever go to Sir Pizza, you go for the pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was good and hot. Not like your normal pizza--very much like a better prepared Totino's Pizza. Convenient to hotel location, appeared clean and friendly, and even had a big screen with s game going on the inside. Got mine to go and check was pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Best pizza evergreat pizza you can taste the quality i love the idea of small cut slices"}
{"text":"Ugggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh this Pizza is the Worst!  i read all the reviews.  Figured you either love it or hate it but its worth trying considering i live fairly close.  NEVER again!  There is no chance the dough is made fresh daily, i can taste the freezer burn!  i havent even had this pizza for 15 minutes and i am writing this review already.  The sauce is bland and the cheese is sparse!   i had to drown it in red hot and crushed red pepper flakes just to eat it!  if you are considering trying Sirs, detour to the nearsest Giant Eagle and buy a frozen pzza.  Tonys, DiGiorno, Tombstone ... because that is exactly what Sirs is comparable to!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sir Pizza was great growing up. The last 5 times I've ate here the pizza was bland and tasteless, no exaggeration. I also ordered breadsticks and it was like they were microwaved with no butter or garlic on them at all.. Really disappointing. After they started opening new locations is when I noticed the quality went down hill drastically. Ill try it again possibly soon in hopes things have changed. I always would crave sir pizza, not so much anymore."}
{"text":"Crust tasted pre-made and frozen. If you're thinking about dining in you might want to check and see if they are holding a kids party. When we visited the parents let the kids run all over the restaurant and they all drank beer and wine in the party room.  We tried to enjoy what we could of our pizza as children ran by or stood next to our table screaming. We ended up tossing 90% of $40 in pizza ( that was just 2 pies)"}
{"text":"We wanted  to love it. Looks like Donato's, tastes like frozen pizza. It wasn't horrible but with all the amazing long-term pizza places in and around The Burgh, this one was definitely underwhelming."}
{"text":"Sir Pizza is a perfect local pizza place.  Prices are great, and the pizza is even better.  The crust is thin, the pepperoni tastes fresh and is crumbled, and the sauce is delicious (worth ordering extra sauce!)  Pepperoni and onion is a winning combination here.  Pizzas are round, but cut into squares, which is kind of fun.  The service is consistently quick and the staff is nice.  If you eat in, the atmosphere is family friendly and feels just like a nostalgic local pizzeria.  Side salads are pretty standard - mainly iceberg, but they're refreshing and fit with the atmosphere.  They do have several beers on tap, including one from East End Brewing (usually Monkey Boy), and they recently started carrying growlers.   If you order during the week, the pizza is even tastier because they seem to put more toppings on."}
{"text":"It's definitely a love or hate place. I personally love Sir Pizza ever since my friends discovered it back when they only had one location. We get the sausage and onion pizza every time. Delicious! The leftover pizza is never as good as when it comes out fresh, but I don't mind it at all because we rarely ever have leftovers."}
{"text":"Sad to say that the customer service at this location was so terribly rude that I did not even get to eat the pizza here.  This used to be one of my favorite places to get pizza from when I was growing up and tonight I called in to ask a few questions before placing a take out order and both times I called was treated rudely (the second time, very rudely) by two different male employees.  For example, after I asked two questions - such as how many people does a large pizza feed, how much does a large pizza cost, the employee cut me off and said that he also did not have the answer to the meaning of life.  This may have been somewhat funny if he were joking or laughed afterwards but he was being obviously rude.  I told him I would take my business elsewhere and ended up ordering from the Wexford location (which I really hope has a different owner than the one that hired these two fools).  The folks at the Wexford location were very nice and their pizza just as good as I remember the North Hills location being!  Sir Pizza in North Hills will never get my business again.  No customer asking basic questions about their pizza sizes and prices deserves to be treated rudely."}
{"text":"I really liked this pizza places stromboli, but when it comes to there pizza I just can't do it. It looks like it just came out of the freezer. Don't even get me started on how it tastes. It's just awful."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  Bottom feeder pizza.  Sorry to say that it reminds me of cafeteria food.  Just plain bad."}
{"text":"I think the \"Love it or Hate it\" comments on other Sir Pizza reviews are definitely fair.  Sir Pizza offers a very different pizza from other local pizzerias, but I find the pizza to be delicious.   We have ordered multiple times and generally just get a large cheese pizza.   It is a round pizza, cut into squares with cheese all the way to the edge (effectively giving the pizza no real crust).  It is great for large groups as it is easy just to grab a couple squares of pizza.  I would definitely recommend the plain cheese - they used diced pepperonis / sausage as opposed to the normal full pepperonis you would typically see at a local pizza shop.  A large cheese pizza feels like a decent value to me, running around $12.  We live a few miles away and they have always been able to have the pizza ready in a half hour, even on busy Friday / Saturday nights.  Why not 5 stars?  They don't offer delivery and the parking lot can be logistically challenging, particularly when it's busy.   Additionally, the menu is relatively limited and the toppings seem to be mediocre (good, but not great) quality."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! A friend introduced us to sir pizza a little while ago. We've become obsessed! Always quick service and food is always great!"}
{"text":"Super good, love the tiny toppings. Being from Cleveland this place gives me my Donatos fix, with the thin crispy pizza.  In the year I have been here, I've noticed Pittsburgh is pretty much a Pizza wasteland (at least in my experience in the North Hills and Cranberry, I've heard a rumor it gets better downtown and south). This place and Mandy's in the North Hills make the only enjoyable pizza in the area."}
{"text":"My kids love it (ages 4 and 5) and we are winning over our new neighbors to the \"oddly cut\" pizza.  I love it as well as I grew up eating it every Friday night.  There are rumors of Philadelphians who drive to PGH just for Sir Pizza...  but I cannot comment on that..."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA EVER.  I've been eating at \"Sir\" since I was 6.  Tonight was no exception.  It's always good, always hot and never disappointing.  It's worth the trip to the Oakmont Rd. location, but luckily, there is one in Wexford now, too.  Get the pepperoni, just pepperoni and you'll never be unhappy.  Eat Sir Pizza and be merry!"}
{"text":"the most amazing pizza and hoagies!  i love the cute little pepporonies too.   the italian hoagie is the best in the city i think!"}
{"text":"After hearing all about how this was the best place to get pizza in North County, I was excited to give this place a try.  Customer service was awful.  I thought I was very clear about my order but when they gave me the wrong thing and I said hmm this isn't what I ordered they just shrugged me off.  I had asked for all meat and they gave me a supreme.. and I couldn't just pick out the olives, mushrooms etc because they are chopped up and under the cheese.  They had no interest in even talking to me, it was just \"Here take it\".  They were busy but not THAT busy.  The pizza itself wasn't good.. the crust tasted stale!  Not crispy, it was stale.  The toppings were so tiny and it was just all around not a good time.  I give it 1 star for the sports games they were playing on the flat screen TVs.  Thumbs down on the customer service and the pizza.  I won't be coming back especially when there are so many pizza places that actually don't treat you like crap and have fresh pizzas.  Center Ave. Slice in West View is a better bet, everything is fresh and the owner always tries to get to know his customers!"}
{"text":"If they delivered this would be the only pizza  we would eat. We love and thin crust, unique cut, and toppings...especially the sausage."}
{"text":"1. Prices go up quality down. 2. The breadsticks are frozen not even pizza dough I know because  they serve them in cafeterias.  Really a dollar each and a 2 oz soufflé cup of sauce. 3.barely any cheese on the pizza 4. Way less pepperoni than a normal large 5. The hoagie should have came on bread that is how soft the bun is.  Honestly never again Fioris has my business.  I will drive in traffic for 45 minutes before I ever order here again"}
{"text":"Great pizza, friendly staff.  The crust is the perfect size (not too thick or thin) and the slices are cut up into squares.  The staff is friendly, and the call-ahead take-out time is only 15 minutes, even on a Friday."}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was tiny, tiny kid. I've always loved it. The pepperoni is truly the best pepperoni I have ever tasted. It's slightly spicy and has great flavor. It's best friend is definitely the sausage. You just can't go wrong with it. If you are feeling like you want something more elaborate, get the works, or as we call it at Sir Pizza, \"The Royal Feast.\" It's a flavor party in your mouth.       The atmosphere here is just great. It's definitely family-like. The guys behind the counter are great and everyone is just in a great mood. We'll come here to celebrate sports victories, after meeting snacks, pregame meals, parties, just about anything you can imagine. My family just loves this place so much.      My friend used to hate Sir Pizza, he went there once and he said that the crust was too salty and that the pizza was cut weird. I kept telling him that he needed to go back and one night he finally relented. The next day he told me exact what I always thought. He told me that it was the best pizza in the 'Burgh and and the square pieces are a good idea. You can eat just the right amount of pizza because the pieces are small and it might sound crazy, but the square pieces might just make the pizza taste better. Just more Sir Pizza legend, but I'm here to tell you that it's probably true.       If you don't know where to eat, and want to eat good food, then venture out to the North Hills Sir Pizza and make not just your day, but your entire week. It's just that special."}
{"text":"If you've ever had good pizza, don't go here.  You'll be gravely disappointed. I don't understand why this place is relatively popular...The service was great and the beer selection wasn't bad but the food is godawful.  Top five worst pizzas I've ever had (including frozen store-bought pizza).  Take this review with a grain of salt, though.  I'm from NJ/NY."}
{"text":"Finally tried Sir Pizza after I saw a Facebook group posting a vote where Sir Pizza won best pizza in the North Hills.  After trying it I just don't get the appeal.  The Royal Feast pizza was just okay, based on the taste I think this place would be great for kids parties though the prices are a bit high for the quality of pizza. I also tried the White Pizza and the tomatoes should have been cut up a bit or Roma tomatoes used instead so they would break down just a little bit more."}
{"text":"Like their white pizza with extra cheese.  I like it crunchy, so I order it well done."}
{"text":"Great for take out or eat in. They have a delicious white pizza and I really enjoyed their regular pizza as well. It's unique because they cute the round pizza into squares, which makes determining how much you actually ate more difficult! Good news: It's so good, you won't want to stop eating it!"}
{"text":"We went to SIr Pizza and were quite pleased with our visit.  We ordered a large plain pizza and a large Italian hoagie. The hoagie was prepared with several Italian meats, along with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and a tasty Italian dressing. It was quite flavorful. The hoagie was cut into 4 pieces, making it easy to eat. Crispy potato chips were served beside the hoagie. The large pizza was uniquely cut into numerous small rectangular pieces, making it quite easy to handle. It was excellent.  The atmosphere was fun and upbeat. A large TV screen was located on one of the walls. Old family wedding pictures adorned the \"La Famiglia\" wall. A large, older video game was available to play in the dining room. The restaurant was quite busy and a bit noisy. However, the restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly and efficient. I know that I'll return to this location in the future."}
{"text":"Sir Pizza is a North Hills staple. I've been eating here since 1st grade. The pizza is unlike others you've had. The toppings go to the edge and it's cut in to squares. Since the pizza is round, this means you get 4 \"corner\" pieces, which are actually triangles. Add some of the grated parmesan cheese and these are the best little bite. We've yet to deviate from the basic toppings... cheese, pepperoni, sausage, or pepperoni/sausage. It's just so yummy.  There are times when we go more than once in a week, so you may want to try something different. The white pizza is a nice change or the italian hoagie is good as well. Sometimes I get a hoagie and pizza because I want a little of both. Either way, yummy!!  I like that you can dine in and grab a pitcher of beer. It's a good casual place for a delicious bite to eat. If by chance you have some left over pizza, don't expect a box because you won't get one. Your pizza will be moved to smaller pizza round cardboard with and placed in a white paper bag. It sounds weird, but to those of us that go, it's totally normal.  FYI...they are packed on Friday nights. Go early or wait for the dinner crowd to die down. If all else fails, get it to go."}
{"text":"My first Yelp review.  Can't believe this just happened.  Had some simple questions about the menu and had to call them back as I was driving and taking a group order and they got frustrated with me asking a 10 second question and grunted and hung up on me.  Then denied it after called back and asked \"did you just hang up on me?\" and hung up on me again!  I buy from them all the time, never again. Ungrateful jerks!!!! Horrible customer service.  There's so many pizza places, I'll take my business to someone who appreciates it and I suggest you do the same.  Which I did.  Called into another place and they thanked me twice.  Give your hard earned dollars to small businesses that appreciate you."}
{"text":"The variety of 1 star and 5 star reviews are pretty accurate. This place is definitely different from other pizza shops and I can see how people would like it, but myself and my family are not one of them. I've had square cut pizzas before so this is not some new novelty to me. I've also had other pizzas with the toppings ground/grated instead of sliced. Both methods are fine for my taste, so these specific things making Sir Pizza \"unique\" in the pittsburgh area did not influence my review, although some others might love or hate this aspect.  We bought a large pepperoni and large white pizzas. Here's my specific breakdown of both:  Pepperoni: The crust: It is not a \"thin\" crust, like a cracker or something similar from pizza hut or papa johns. It is a regular thickness, but has cheese and toppings to near the edge and is square cut, meaning there is no huge breadstick like crust on the end to hang onto. I like the to the edge topping, and I did not think it was freezer burnt or tough. It was light but crispy. Overall it was average. My wife however said it was terrible. If this crust was cut like a normal pizza into \"pie\" sections, I don't think people would think too much about it, but since it's square cut it gets a lot of attention.  Toppings: the pepperoni being grated/ground into small pieces was fine. Their website claims it is to distribute the flavor evenly. I've had this type of topping before and I have liked it in the past, but the pepperoni was a little bland. Overall, like the crust, average.  The sauce: This is where the pizza really took a hit. Some other reviews describe it as sweet, i agree with other reviewers that it is just bland. There is not flavor there. It was pretty bad. Add some spices guys.  Cheese: I like provolone on my pizza instead of mozzarella, which Sirs Pizza has. It's a higher quality and more expensive cheese. There's a reason the crappy $4 pizza at the super market has a big \"100% mozzarella\" label on it, because mozzarella is a cheap cheese. So I'm glad they use a better ingredient, they just put barely any on the pizza. To say the cheese is sparse is being kind.  White: The white pizza had the same crust and cheese as the pepperoni, so you either like it on both or you don't. where the white fell short again was in the sauce. I like my white to have a strong garlic taste, this was again bland. The tomato topping drown out the garlic flavor making it taste more like a bruschetta without only diced tomatoes and olive oil without any seasoning. Again average at best.  My wife said it was the worst pizzas she has ever had, saying she preferred Digorno, which I think is definitely over dramatic, but still, she hated it. I thought it was average, which made what I hated, THE PRICE, even worse. Two 14\" pizzas with 1 topping for $28. That should be gourmet, not meh.   So the wife hated it, the kids didn't like it but didn't hate it. I thought it was on par quality with a little caesars, which I can get for $5 each, not $12, so hard pass in the future. 3* for me, 1* for the wife equals 2* overall.   If you like toppings to the edge of your pizza, or square cut, or ground meats instead of sliced, you may like this place, but there is severe lack of overall flavor and the price doesn't make it nearly enough of a deal to overlook that. Look elsewhere.  I'm also from Pittsburgh so I'm not a NY pizza fascist that will never like anything from here ;)"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh -- their Pepperoni and Sausage are amazing.   This is a sister location to Pizza King from Indiana.  If you want the best-- this is it!!!!  Amazing !!"}
{"text":"I ordered a gluten-free pizza. I guess it was OK. The crust is a little soft , tasted under cooked. Place was mobbed. I had to scream on the phone four times I was looking for an antipasta which we know is an Italian salad. The girl on the other end of the phone said \"we have two types of pasta regular and spaghetti\" seriously?"}
{"text":"This Sir Pizza is an oasis in an area that is like a desert for restaurants. There aren't many choices in this part of town near I-79 in Wexford. We recently found Sir Pizza, and we're very glad that we did. It's the perfect place for a quick bite before or after events at Orchard Hill Church. You order and pay at a counter, and they call your name when the food is ready. They offer beer - drafts on tap and micro brew bottles - and wine by the glass, which is almost a requirement to go with a good, hot slice of pizza. Their pizza crust is thin and crispy. I recommend that you go with their specialty, the Sir Pizza Royal Feast, on your first visit to get the full experience. The Royal Feast comes with pepperoni, mushrooms, red and green sweet peppers, onions, and sausage, all diced finely and smothering the pizza. The dining area is casual with booths and tables that are perfect for groups hanging out or families with small children. They do a brisk take-out business, and obviously have a lot of regulars that they know on a first-name basis. Sir Pizza is a small-town pizza shop the way that I remember them from my childhood."}
{"text":"This isn't your ordinary Pizza Place. It is the best pizza that Pittsburgh has to offer. No contest required. I recommend the royal feast. It is a great place to grab dinner with family or friends. They also do take out orders. The Pizza is great and I'm not sure what else to say."}

{"text":"What is the chance that you travel to Pittsburgh and find good pizza? Well thats exactly what happened when we went to visit some friends in the Burgh and to my amazement they actually cut their pizza in squares. I thought that only happened in Chicago and definitely not on the Eastern half of the US.   We had a larger group including two small kids so we had a variety of pizza and pastas covered in butter. The interesting thing about the pizza is the sausage and pepperoni is diced up small and spread across the whole pizza. It may sound weird but it worked and I actually sitting here am starting to crave another slice or two.  I would have to say some of the best pizza I have had outside of Chicago. They also have a nice beer selection if you so desire."}
{"text":"Sir Pizza tastes (and looks) like the best frozen Tony's pizza you've ever had. The toppings are tasteless, the crust is very dense and firm, and the prices are very, very high for what you get. A 10\" pizza with two toppings was a bit over $10. The pizza was cut into about 12 2\"x2\" square chunks, had they cut it into the traditional slices you might have been able to squeek out 6 small slices.   I also grabbed a six pack of Yuengling to go with my pizza. I wish I would have asked about the price first, it was over $10 for a six pack.   Ordering from Sir Pizza was a $20 mistake I'll be sure to never repeat."}
{"text":"I ate here this past weekend with with 3 dining companions.  Before I say too much in my review I have to admit that this is not my first time coming here and that I have been to Sir Pizza many times throughout the years.   For me it is very much a nostalgic place and I love that they still have tabletop games of Mrs. Pacman and Dig Dug that you can play for a quarter and a jukebox.  For dinner my dining companions and I split two large pizzas, one pepperoni and one half mushroom half cheese and a crusader hoagie.  The pizza is cut interestingly here, 3 times across and 3 times down down giving you a number of small pieces which always leads to you eating just one more.  The pizzas were both good with the pepperoni being crumbled instead of sliced and the sauce seemed to lack some saltiness.  The hoagie was a little soggy by the time it got to me due to the dressing that was on but had a decent amount of Italian meats and tasted pretty good.  I would give the food itself 3 stars.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here in the future.  While the food is satisfactory, that is not the only reason to come to Sir Pizza as the atmosphere is great as well."}
{"text":"Pizza is good don't bother ordering extra cheese there's no difference from playin from a plain pizza very disappointing with popping"}
{"text":"Pizza is good but if you order extra cheese there's no difference same as plain not generous on the extra cheese very disappointing"}
{"text":"First (and probably last) timer at Sir Pizza.  Large pizza was edible but I swear it was a frozen pizza - complete with the cardboard circle it rests on.  Thin, boring crust with mediocre toppings. And to boot it was ice cold when I arrived home (10 min drive). Got a chef salad also which was white iceberg lettuce with crumbles of ham and cheese, and croutons. Very little else.  I know Sir Pizza has been around for a long time, but I don't get it."}
{"text":"I think Sir Pizza is one of those love it or hate it places. I personally love it!   The sauce, dough, cheese, and toppings are nothing like a traditional pizza and that makes me happy because I can get those types anywhere in Pittsburgh. The sauce it's self is a bit on the sweet side, to combat this I add plenty of cheese and red pepper flakes. The dough is thin and crispy but not too thin like a cracker, and the pizza is sliced \"party style\".  The interior is a great transition from the past to the present including family photos, a juke box, super Mario cabinet and a Pac-Man cocktail table.  They serve alcohol as well as soda (which is only $1.15)   I love this place and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Awful awful pizza. Doesn't compare with ANY good Pittsburgh pizza (Mineo's/Aiello's/Fiore's). Hard, nasty crust. Dumb square shape. Yuch."}
{"text":"I know folks who love Sir Pizza but I don't understand why.  Tried a large cheese pizza with extra cheese yesterday.  The crust was blah, not even as good as a cheap frozen pizza.  The sauce was minimal and tasteless.  There wasn't much cheese even though I ordered extra cheese.  Cost was $15.00 and not a good value."}
{"text":"I accepted a challenge to try Sir Pizza from a friend after he took me to what was the place that he thought was the best Pizza in Pittsburgh... having been new to this other establishment, I was willing to try what he said was the most disgusting to him (however, what was most disgusting to him was one of his buddies favorite places--- Sir Pizza).  I am open minded, love Pizza, and am new to the Pittsburgh area after many years away, so I figured I would try it, and who knows, maybe he was wrong and it will be good.  The sauce sucks, the dough sucks, and even the pepperoni sucks.  I would have been better off getting a Totino's pizza from the local Giant Eagle as it would have been far more satisfying!  My advice... do not waste your time on Sir Pizza if you have taste!"}
{"text":"I ordered the white cheese pizza with tomatoes which was a mistake. I liked how the pizza was cut into squares but wasn't crazy about the pizza. I wish I didn't get tomatoes on the pizza because I don't think it tasted good as topping and I kept burning my mouth from the tomatoes. I would have to try a regular pizza next time."}
{"text":"I had the pepperoni and sausage pizzas. Both were slightly bland, but good in that the sauce, cheese, and toppings went all of the way to the crust. The crust, which is thin, is nice and crisp. Overall, a good, but not mind-blowing pizza eating experience."}
{"text":"When they say the word  nostalgia this place must come to mind because I don't know what else is keeping them in business for so long. This pizza is equivalent to a cheap frozen pie, all the toppings are diced up small and they cut it in small irregular pieces in a checkerboard style  which I don't understand but some like it this way. If you want a real pizza go to Fioris, A'Pizza Badamo, Slice On Broadway, Mineos, or Aiellos just to name a few."}
{"text":"Too much money for disgusting pizza. They have the pizza cut into strips which sucks. No flavor, tastes like frozen pizza.... I have always heard great reviews for this place.... ya not what I expected"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Saturday evening with my wife and 5 other members of my family for dinner.  We decided to come here since my sister was in town and Sir Pizza is her favorite pizza place.  Normally we would go to the original location (Sewickley Oakmont Rd.) but my mother thought it would be crowded and so we ended up here.  The inside of this place looks like many pizza joints as it has a counter to order from up front, a soda machine nearby and then a number of tables and booths to sit at.  In addition to this there was a large TV on one of the walls that had sports on it.  For dinner our party decided to order two crusader hoagies and three large pizzas: one plain, one with pepperoni and one half bacon half mushroom.  Our pizzas came out rather quickly and I started eating the pepperoni as soon as it hit our table.  If you have never been to Sir Pizza before then the first thing that you notice is that they cut their pizzas in an unusual fashion.  They cut it three times longways and then three times sideways which gives you a number of different shaped small slices.  It can actually be quite nice if you are not looking for a full piece of pizza.  One thing that I really enjoy about Sir Pizza is that their pepperoni topping is crumbled pepperoni instead of slices and that it tastes really good.  With that being said I really ended up enjoying the pepperoni pizza especially whenever I noticed that the bottom of the crust was crispier than normal.  Sadly only the pepperoni was that way and I was slightly disappointed whenever I tried the bacon only to have the crust at the normal crispiness.  I ended up not trying the cheese pizza nor the mushroom pizza as the mushrooms looked like canned mushrooms and the cheese was gone by the time we had finished the pepperoni.  After the pizzas disappeared I then proceeded to eat most of a crusader hoagie myself.  The crusader hoagie consists of ham, salami, capicolla, cheese, onions, lettuce, tomatoes and oil & vinegar all on a 12 inch bun.  This particular crusader hoagie seemed to be swimming with the oil & vinegar and while I liked all of the other items in the hoagie, I could have done without most of the dressing.  The bottom line for me is that I am sure I will be back here again in the future.  While it is not my favorite pizza in the world, my sister certainly enjoys it and it is nostalgic for me."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Every time I come home from college, I have to come in and get a pepperoni and sausage pizza. It is absolutely to die for, anyone who says otherwise didn't give it a proper try. Wexford location is the best. Wouldn't go to any other locations."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza on earth. This after not having lived in Pittsburgh for 16 years, a million frequent flyer miles, and  then coming home for a visit. EXACTLY as I remember! The ground pepperoni and sausage are unique. Awesome!"}
{"text":"This review is on the pizza alone, uniquely their own. We enjoy eating here with our children because they seem to really love this pizza. I do feel like the toppings are chopped a bit small and kind of feel mass produced. All in all if the kids like it we like it but I really do not see us ever going here once the kids have grown and gone. 5 stars for kids 3 stars for adults and a solid 4 stars all together"}
{"text":"This used to be Friday night dinner every week when I was growing up. My parents would round up my brother and I (usually a few additional playmates of ours too) and head down the hill from the house I grew up in to enjoy a pizza pie. I love the fact they had the old-school style pac-man game I nostalgically remember pumping money into and an old fashioned jukebox to boot. The Sir Pizza \"gimmic\", if you will, is a round pizza with square cuts. Thus the \"corner pieces\" are small and triangular (which were always my favorite pieces but I digress). The sausage and pepperoni is crumbled, not large slices, so be mindful of that if its not your cup of tea. The mushrooms come from a can too- it's pretty obvious from how they are limp and lack any flavor. You order at the counter and pick it up at the counter. They do have some nice craft beer but that's a more recent development. I don't see the fascination with this place, honestly, however, if you're not looking for a chain, options in this area are kinda limited. I definitely thought this pizza was awesome growing up, but only because I didn't know better. One star for being unique with the round pizza, square cuts and one star for nostalgia."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where nostalgia sells the food. If you didn't grow up with this pizza and have fond childhood memories of it, then it's just not very good. Not terrible, but not good either. Told my girlfriend (who is from the area, grew up on this stuff and LOVES it) that, with the diced pepperoni and severely pulverized sausage, it looks exactly like the $1.29 Totino's frozen pizza that you get at the grocery store. Unfortunately, the taste is just a step or two above its frozen counterpart. With all the really good pizza places in the 'Burgh, I'm not sure why anyone would choose Sir Pizza."}
{"text":"SETTING Casual. Multiple booths if you choose to dine in. Very clean and spacious. On the wall, there is a nice TV that usually shows sporting events.  FOOD We ordered a pizza with single toppings: Pepperoni on one half and sausage on the other half.   Sir Pizza's sausage is the small, crumbly kind. Similarly, the pepperoni is also miniature. The little cut up cubes of pepperoni and sausage crumbles were generously sprinkled all over the pizza. Remember Bagel Bites (those pizza bagel things from way way back)? They had the same exact sausage and pepperoni things. Sir Pizza tasted just like bagel bites too! What a throw back to my childhood days, when I would climb out of the pool and race to the table to devour snacks on snacks on snacks. Pizza bagels was always a summer day staple. The pizza here is also served with square cuts.   SERVICE Order at the counter, which is the front part of the kitchen. They call you up once your order is out. Not a long wait. Self service (you pickup your own napkins, plates, drinks).   IMPRESSIONS All I wanted was some pizza! Not only did I get that, I was also reminded of my Bagel Bite phase. I miss those carefree days where I did not have any real responsibilities (other than keeping my room clean, like every other kid). I have a fondness for the simple things in life. Sir Pizza is one of those simple things I appreciate. All they need is a pool, and Dexter's Laboratory (my favorite cartoon network show) on the TV and you have the ingredients to remake my childhood summer days :)"}
{"text":"It's an acquired taste. The toppings alone are bland and boring. All together they work.  It's the only pizza all of my kids can agree on.   A large pizza feeds 2 hungry kids or adults. Bring your full wallet"}
{"text":"I don't get the allure, but I'm not from Pittsburgh. Weirdly cut pizza.. apparently it's a post- Little League mainstay..."}
{"text":"Sir Pizza certainly has a love-it or hate-it taste/style to it, obviously I am for the love-it side of the fence.  I grew up in the mid 80's nearby off of Rochester Road and this was probably the closest pizza place around our home.  The fact that it has remained for nearly 30 years of my lifetime shows they have a following enough to sustain business!  I have lived in Phoenix, Arizona for the last 12 years and although I have paid a visit to PA from time to time I this may have been my first visit to Sir Pizza  in those 12 years.  I was showing my wife (whose never been to Pittsburgh) where I grew up and around the city and Sir Pizza was on the tour as a must to stop and eat at! The visit did not disappoint, unless you count her introduction to I.C. Light which brought a very funny face out.  Service was friendly, fast and when I said I hadn't been here for years the gal at the counter said welcome back.    The pizza did not disappoint us and only added to the great time we were having.  We ordered a 14\" pepperoni which is my go to here and the small cuts almost always lead me to go for one more.  We said we'd stop eating with 10 pieces on the pie plate and by the time we left there were two.  I've never come across another pizza place that crumbles their pepperoni and the perfect combination of thin crust, not too sweet or salty sauce and provolone cheese just works.    I refer back to the start of this review, you may not love-it but at least try it.  You never know when you may find your favorite memory and can pass it on and can retell the story later in life."}
{"text":"I really love this place. I have been going here ever since I was a little kid. The pizza is very unique as it is crumbled pepperoni or sausage on small cuts of pizza. It is very tasty and always very fresh. Most people either hate it or love it. I surely love it. I could eat at this place at least once a week. I've also gotten the Crusader Hoagie here which is a toasted Italian sub cut into 4 pieces and serves on a plate with a generous proportion of chips on the side. They do have a nice dining room area with a few televisions. You can also order for pickup, however they do not deliver.   I can assure you this pizza is unlike any you have had before. It is very good and the employees are very friendly and on top of things. Great place!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating Sir Pizza from this location since I was a kid, and it's a legend in the North Hills area.  I grew up on the thin crust, rectangular-cut pieces, herbed melty cheese, and spicy crumbled pepperoni.  The black olive and mushroom combination was also pretty amazing once I transitioned to vegetarianism, and although I've had to give it up due to my recent turn as a vegan... I might have to bite the bullet and sneak a piece next time I'm in the 'Burgh.  To this day, I have yet to eat better pizza anywhere.  I come back home once or twice a year and it always tastes just as good as it did 15 years ago."}
{"text":"I have been a customer for many years both of this location and the original location. The food is good (especially the Italian hoagies - which are delicious) they are quick with your order and friendly every time."}
{"text":"Ace pizza every time we go. The white pizza is absolutely delicious. The uniquely cut pizzas makes it easier to serve, kids or a large party. Bring a growler to bring home some beer!"}
{"text":"Another Pizza place -- a single experience.  A local venue for oh so many people.  The food is great (for pizza), it is so convenient to this part of Wexford that it is the \"go to\" pizza place, it is not a chain (cookie cutter).  Prices are very reasonable, service was good.    The pictures that are posted -- only one of them makes sense as a point of advertising.  The one on the far right looks like a frozen pizza with a cardboard backing!!!  ((sure it is not but the image doesn't help their cause)).  You can ask your pizza to be cut anyway you like.  I suggest the small squares -- easier to manage/control.  f8 and be there."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh recently and craving pizza.  Based on the reviews on Yelp, we chose Sir Pizza.    The crust was hard and dense, definitely not thrown.  The sauce was boring and the toppings were bland.  The pepperoni is more like crumbled sausage and lacks flavor.  If this is the best pizza in the North Hills, then Pittsburgh still isn't a good pizza town."}
{"text":"My rating is based on the pepperoni pizza. There are very limited options for pizza in this area and unfortunately, none of them are any good.  SIr Pizza is definitely one of them.  Silly round pizza cut into tiny squares is perfect for a little kid slumber party, but so is Totino's.  The crust is thin, almost non-existent, the cheese is barely melted and the pepperoni is diced like something you would find at a salad bar. I ordered take-out so I can't really say anything about dine-in atmosphere or service."}
{"text":"Someone said here in the reviews \"I think Sir Pizza is one of those love it or hate it places.\" and I definitely am on the \"hate it\" side of the fence. Not my kind of pizza. At all."}
{"text":"Always a favorite of ours....the pizza is fantastic!  And the calzones...wowzer!  They are HUGE and SO YUMMY!  We will keep going back again and again!"}
{"text":"I love Sir's. The calzones are Huge and stuffed full of wonderful goodness. Their sausage is amazing! And they really make them to order. The hubby gets them without the ricotta. And their pizza...yum! The sauce is a little on the sweet side and the crust has some saltiness to it. It all works for a harmonious relationship that is a treat to the taste buds.  Oh Sir's, how I missed thee. :)"}
{"text":"5 stars because this is my second favorite pizza place in Pittsburgh. My #1 (Manhattan style pizza) is far from home and not convenient anymore. Sir Pizza is also very very good and I'm happy to have found a closer to home option. The Sir Pizza style is different than any I've ever had but I love it. They cut it into little squares and the toppings are diced and spread generously across the top. They sell beer here and parking is ample. There are lots of tables inside and this would probably be good for large groups."}
{"text":"I've finally tried the North Hills famous \"Sir Pizza\".  As a lover of pizza (and cheeseburgers, but that's another story) I find myself often enjoying the debate over who has the best pizza in the burgh' (oh wait... that would be a good \"talk\" thread, I'll have to remember to post) and I often hear \"sir pizza\", so it's a bit shocking its taken me this long to check out this institution.  Incidentally, this may surprise many of you sir pizza lovers, but it turns out according to my girlfriend that said' pizza joint is actually a national chain, which in my eyes does diminish its stature just a bit.  Annie and I stopped here last lazy sunday around 230 pm.  It was pretty empty at the time, however I'm told that's a pretty rare thing and watch out if you stop by after a friday night football game.  The restaurant itself is adequate enough there are plenty of booths scattered about and it looked like a private dining area to the side in the back.  I noticed one of my favorite type of video games.  The two seater table style pacman which is a rare treat indeed.  You order at the large counter in the front.  It looks like they have a really good selection of microbrews and a few beers on tap.  We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and onions and black olives on half for me.  We also ordered an order of bread sticks and then had a seat.  The breadsticks were up first and quite frankly they were pretty forgettable.  It was four average warm breadsticks served with a relatively tasty marinara.  Then a few minutes later our pizza was up.  The pizza was pretty large and to my surprise was sliced in a very interesting manner in really small cubes almost.  So, instead of 8 slices for example there were about 30 smaller pieces.  I liked this, it was fun and a good way for me to get around my 3 slice rule.  The pizza itself was pretty tasty.  The crust was really interesting.  It was thin crust kind of since it was pretty crispy, but then not quite thin crust because once you got past initial crunch it was a little doughy.  The sauce was a little sweet and plentiful and the cheese was just right not too much not too little.  The pepperoni was also pretty unique instead of slices it was more like crumbled pepperoni which was fitting given the way the pizza was sliced.  Overall the pizza was very good...Certainly not my favorite in the burgh' but maybe that's because I didn't grow up with it.  My buddy says they also make good hoagies here, so I'll have to give that a whirl on my next trip.  One last thing I normally would give this joint three stars, however after we left I noticed when we got to Target I didn't have my wallet.  Annie called and they had found it on the counter and had it waiting for me,,, what a relief.  Overall a good spot that I'll visit again."}
{"text":"I don't know why, but I feel like people either love or hate this pizza...I think it depends on what kind of pizza person you are. I LOVE this pizza...probably the best for me in Pgh. The pizza itself is a fairly thin crust (not too doughy or greasy), with the perfect amount of sauce and cheesy, with the toppings cut and minced so every piece has the right amount of everything. It is also cut into squares which is the best part! There really is something about this pizza...myself and other family members are required to bring it to relatives in Cali that are Pgh natives...that is how much they crave it! The hoagies and other dishes are also pretty good...we just can't resist the pizza! The breadsticks are also the best I have ever had...really light and airy with the lightest garlic butter taste. YUMMY!"}
