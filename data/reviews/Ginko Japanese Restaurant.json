{"text":"In fairness I would give Ginko 3 1/2 stars but was unable to do that. The fare is not terribly creative but it is an oasis in the Pearson airport area where there are so few decent choices and many restaurants which are just awful. The sushi is always fresh and tasty and the service is friendly. I have usually opted for combination platters since they are quick and easy at lunch. I also recommend the gyoza (basically Japanese potstickers) which are always flavorful and properly cooked. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm between a 3 and a 4 star here. My husband and I ordered sushi- spicy tuna, salmon, rainbow, spicy yellowtail, tuna, and california. The selection wasn't very big, probably because there's also Hibachi. Our rolls were good and very fresh but I would probably venture elsewhere for sushi if I were to return to the area. The salmon and tuna had huge amounts of wasabi in them which wasn't mentioned on the menu, so I got a big mouthful of it on first bite. On the upside, the edamame was awesome."}
{"text":"Sashimi were melt in ur mouth experience. Truly enjoyed every bite:). Chefs, wait staff communicated in Japanese which added a nice touch of authentic  will definitely return."}
{"text":"Have dinner or lunch many times per month. Never disappointed, one of the best value for money you will spend in this area."}
{"text":"Second review for Ginko. The restaurant is located in the International Plaza Hotel on Dixon Rd. Excellent sushi, very fresh fish. Usual nigiri choices include the red Tuna, himachi, scallop, salmon - all excellent. Scallop also good. also enjoy the cooked items, such as the Karaage and Gindara.  excellent food, and a must try... luckily I work just north of the airport so I am a frequent visitor  remember to ask the staff to validate your parking ticket."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a decade.  Right up my alley - AUTHENTIC JAPANESE CUISINE, not the fancy fu-fu sushi bar.  Had some special Uni tonight flown in from Japan (out of season in June in the USA) and was great.  If you're all about the fish and not entertainment, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Real authentic Japanese cuisine. Very good ambiance and decor - not overly done or cheesy. The meal is slightly more expensive than other Japanese restaurants, but the quality is high and it is located in an upscale airport hotel. Service was very good."}
{"text":"I was there for take out but sorry I have to say such a waste of money. Sashimi is not fresh at all and the thin slice doesn't worth of the money. Very fishy after taste. 5slices for $15 I can get way better quality sashimi elsewhere. The rolls was terrible, rice weren't stick together, the taste was below average. Overall poor service cuz not enough server, food quality was way below average and not worth the price. Will never go back."}
{"text":"What an unexpected surprise to run into such a wonderful Japanese Restaurant.   Service was impeccable, the restaurant beautiful, and the food tremendous.  Very authentic and a great experience.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Came here after a convention for a friends birthday. We reserved the tables and brought a cake for our friend requested it to be a surprise.  The service and food was pretty disappointing, we waited soooo long just to wave someone down and have the food served to us. Although the staff was Japanese, this was nothing like the food I tasted in Japan. The sushi was very westernized and the dishes were expensive for what you get. A bento costed $20 yet you could get the same thing for $10 elsewhere.   They did redeem themselves though with the cake, they served it on cute dishes and surprised our friend. The staff all sang happy birthday and even dimmed the lights and played music for us. That was a really nice surprise and it earns them another star.  Still, the food is disappointing and I probably won't return."}
{"text":"First off, let's start with the good.  There was only 1 other table occupied when I came here for dinner, so I was seated right away.  Service was quick and efficient.  The ambiance was nice and relaxing.  The $13.50 soft shell crab was good.  It had a little dank taste to the body, but the texture was nice and crispy and the legs were delicious.  The free green tea with Yelp check in was also good.  Service was also good.  Then there was the bad.  This might be the first time I didn't finish a maki roll and I arrived hungry.  I ordered the royal York roll, which has my favorite BBQ eel on it, and it might just be the most disgusting roll I have ever had.  The sauce was citrusy...possibly contained some sort of orange flavoring.  It was a huge turn off.  Some of the pieces were cut too big making it hard to chew and combined that with the tiny bones I found in the eels, I couldn't eat all of it.  I was chewing the second to last piece for a while, trying to pull out the bones as I chewed and it just became more and more gross in my mouth that I had to spit it out.  I felt bad because they didn't have any paper napkins, so I hid the pile on my plate under some ginger.  ....| \      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,       .../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \ -  ;  ;  ;  , _     ..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .

{"text":"Please label and sort your foods carefully!  This is not the first but second time I had ordered their vegetarian kelp onigiri (rice ball) to find that they had mis-labeled a meat filling version. This is absolutely unacceptable because the sale is misleading especially for someone with serious diet or allergies.  I can understand it does get busy when they set up their stand for their   food stand sales during convention time but please, please, onegaishimasu, separate and label your foods properly!   Buyers be warned and check the food under the wrapper before you dig in."}
{"text":"Gotta be clear and quick this this place,  Fact, Ginko is considered by several Japanese Magazines in Toronto as one of the best/must visit places, since the quality of the food and service is considered top of the top.  Food/Quality: They have the best I have tasted in the city (amount Japanese restaurants) you can see that the food is carefully prepared and done with details, every single component is cook with perfection... Definitely worth the visit and try their main courses.  FYI, Ginko is a place that will serve you quality food, good for tasting, explore flavours and know a bit more about Japanese cuisine, if you are expecting a lot of food, I don't think this is place is the best idea, bring your date not your friends lol  Now the reason why this place is 4 star instead of 5. I would rather give the place 3.5 instead of 4... all those stars are for the chef (hats off), but what needs to be fixed is the service. We got a local server, what i mean is a Canadian person, who was a bit slow in the work and didn't care much about us (I went with a group of foodie friends)... I wonder if he looked down on us, like we didn't have money or something like that.  I also presented a promo code from Yelp which I was supposed to get a free drink, but he just said, \"No we don't do that\".. that's it, not even a better way to say it or any other explanation. I am not a server but I would had said \"Sorry, that could have been an old promotion that we didn't remove from Yelp\". I really wanted to ask for a new server right after that."}
{"text":"Really not impressed with the poor service...very rude and condescending. There are dishes at all the tables and the servers are taking their sweet time to clear up the eye sore. It's kind of annoying when they walk by me constantly with the dirty dishes because the tables are so cramped.  The wakame salad is the worst I've ever tasted - dry and unseasoned. $9.50 + tax to boot. If that's authentic, it's not for me. I just left - I didn't order anything else after the miserable experience I've had thus far. I do not recommend dining alone. FYI prices are higher than usual."}
{"text":"Chose this location for my birthday. Private Tatami room was a let down, as they didn't close it off. If I wanted to sit with everyone else I would have made reservations for a table and saved myself the 15% aka $60 gratuity for 2 people. Come on, show some respect for your customers... Best part of this experience was the $75 bottle of sake. Food portions were small, flavours lacking and rice sadly horrendous, sushi platter was questionable at best as fish pieces tasted odd. A grave disappointment for a special occasion, but happy it was for my own birthday and I didn't subject another person to this. At $360 for a party of 2 out of 8 people this was a let down. I'm only giving 2 stars because the service was lovely and the sake was amazing. I will give this place a 2nd chance as it was a VERY busy weekend for them and I know their quality to be better as I have eaten here a few times before.  Atmosphere- 3/5 Food - 1/5 Setting- 0/5 (Really needs an update...looks rundown) Drinks- 5/5"}
{"text":"We went with friends from the area who were looking for something local to the airport.  I had the chicken and steak combination as well as some sashimi and thought it was OK.  The wait staff is friendly and tries real hard.  The decor was ... well, let's just remember it's located in a Doubltree.    Overall, it wasn't a bad experience and I would likely go again if in the area."}
{"text":"Teppanyaki was quite entertaining and tasty. It looks like high - end traditional Japanese restaurant . Waitress and all staffs include owner are all Japanese .  The only one thing I concerned  in this restaurant, it's little bit pricy and  not very friendly ."}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese cuisine -- this is a place to get great homestyle Japanese food...cooked by REAL Japanese people (yes, this is very rare in Toronto!!!!).  Ask for the Japanese menu if you really want homestyle cooking -- lots of donburi, udon, ramen, and ochazuke!!!!! We are regulars here -- the fish is always FRESH, and the sushi is always really good. The service is always pretty good as well, except when they get huge conferences in the hotel and then become packed on short notice.  The prices are a bit higher than I would expect, but I supposed that's because it is in an airport hotel. But, if you want authentic Japanese fare, that will always be dependably good, Ginko is a great option!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off for the past 5 years and have found a decline in the food quality and volume of customers.  We just went last night, and for a Saturday the restaurant was at 1/5th of their capacity. The food -- both sushi/sashimi and cooked meals -- were not as fresh as they used to be... misoyaki chicken wasn't that fresh and my wife said the same about the fish... although the prices have either gone up or stayed the same, which is higher than the normal sushi joint.  I don't know if the management/ownership has changed or simply the volume is lacking and because of this the quality has gone down...but, this restaurant is no longer the same Ginko Restaurant that I would recommend to friends and colleagues as my go to authentic sushi joint near the airport."}
{"text":"Had dinner here when my flight was cancelled and I had to stay in Plaza International Hotel.  Food was very good and fresh.  I had a bento box.    But what impressed me most of all was their customer service!  I left my scarf there, and they mailed it back to me in NYC free of charge!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and the service was very good and quick at taking my order. I started with the gyoza which were good and the sauce that it came with wasn't too sweet. I ordered the sushi and tempura bento box and had then give me all tuna for the sushi. It was an up charge of 8CAD to get all tuna. It also includes miso soup and a salad. The miso was very good one of the better miso soups I've had. The salad was fresh and light and the dressing wasn't my favorite ginger dressing but was still good. I could have definitely used a little more dressing as well. The bento box was on the smaller side for 19CAD however it was filling with everything else I had. The tuna sushi was good and little chewy but was tender and a good size for sushi. It also came with 2 pieces of a California roll and 2 pieces of a spicy tuna roll. They were both good not the best but not the worst I've had. The tempura was my favorite as the tempura was light and crunchy. The shrimp were great and nice sized and all the veggies I loved as well. I definitely would come back and I also saw they have a Teppenyakki table. I'm assuming that is for dinner only but want to try it."}
{"text":"The five of us went here for the 30th anniversary party tonight. This wonderful buffet (39 dollars plus tax) was created by Ginko master chef Nobu Nakamori. This won't be a traditional review since the restaurant was closed and this was a special function but hopefully y'all will still find it useful :)  The ambiance was lovely and cozy. This is a restaurant inside of the hotel. Parking is free if you are there less than 3 hours which is also handy.   The evening started with Kagami Wari Sake. They served them in these nifty cedar block cups. Interesting flavour and you could really taste the cedar too! It was really good but I really enjoyed the sake that we actually ordered for the table (Junmai Ginjo) which was 85 for the bottle.   On to the meal itself. Appetizers included tomato with tofu, lobster puffs and a type of devilled egg (pics attached). The buffet was sushi, various rolls, various hot items, braised beef, oysters, and much more. Food was delicious, a solid 4 out of 5. Staff was very friendly. If you are looking for an authentic Japanese meal, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the delta hotel recently where this restaurant is located. Aesthetically the restaurant is traditional and lovely. Service was average. Menu had great options. I found some items to be overpriced. They were asking for $3 for a cup of miso soup. We had the gyoza's as a appetizer which we enjoyed. Juicy and crispy. We ordered 3 rolls, the crispy salmon, the rainbow roll and the avocado salmon roll. You would think after reading the detailed description of the chef and thus restaurant that the sushi would stand out. But in reality, it's like any other average sushi. The amount of sushi was little compared to the value you pay and the rolls didn't seem to have any attention to detail. Even by plating a dish differently could elevate this. All in all, not bad but not great - just average."}
