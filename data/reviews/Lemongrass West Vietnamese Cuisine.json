{"text":"So my husband and I were looking for a Vietnamese restaurant in our area and found this place.  We went three times.  The first time was quite good, the spring rolls were fresh and vermicelli was tasty.  

Second time service was terrible, we were ignored until hubby went up and asked for service and we had to ask for water three times.  

Third time same issue with service and water.  The big issue this time was we watched a server drop a sauce bottle on the floor then put it right back on the table without making an effort to clean it off or replace.  Major no-no for anyone who has an issue with germs.  Food is good but will not be going back. Ever."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Fair price. Would eat here anytime!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Lemongrass regularly for several years. Their spicy sate beef pho is always great on a cold day, definitely has a nice kick to it. Their spring rolls are my absolute favorite, not greasy at all and fresh ingredients used. 

My only issues with Lemongrass are that service when you eat in can be very slow. One time, my friend and I waited 20 minutes just for someone to come take our drink order. The gentleman who served us was super nice and apologized for the wait, saying they were short-staffed. Another time, my friend and I asked for separate bills, and the older lady was incredibly rude about it. I understand it is not always easy to do separate bills (the restaurant I work at does not do separate bills for parties of 6 or more). But instead of saying, \"Sorry we can't do that\", she shouted \"NO\" at us. Someone should not be working in customer service clearly!

I absolutely love the food here, and often I have really nice servers despite the sometimes slow service. But this lady had such a chip on her shoulder, and as long as I don't have to deal with her, I don't have any other complaints."}
{"text":"The food is decent in my opinion, the service is not, specially if your server is the mature lady who has not a good attitude, or interest for customers selections"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Menu item #50 vermicelli was the bomb and the chicken salad rolls were fantastic.  The whole family agreed!"}
{"text":"First time going and its gonna be the last one. Very disappointed with this place ,  i had a hair in my glass of water and my wife had a hair in her soup which make me believe it is not the cleanest place . When we went to pay they still charged us full price, not even a discount or anything and when my wife asked about it they got really mouthy and said \" at least i replace the bowl for you\" my wife advised her that was the least they could do. They all screamed at her as she walked out infront of other customers! Do not give these pigs your money!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. I dropped in for lunch and had the bun (rice vermicelli) with charbroiled lemongrass chicken breast, beef and shrimp. The charbroiled flavour was perfect; the meats were a high quality and portions plentiful. I especially loved the chicken! The sprouts and veggies were crisp and delicious. Service was efficient and friendly. Food was better than most Vietnamese places I have visited in Calgary. I will make this a regular stop for sure!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! Great food and wonderfully  clean. Recommend the salad rolls and any one of the vermicelli dishes. Price is fair and they offer eat in or take out! I opted for take out and the server was very attentive, offering water and a table to sit at while waiting. Everyone seemed to take real pride in their jobs and the restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch as I was working in the area.  

This place is a little hidden gem.  It's your standard Vietnamese food.  The menu is huge, some 150+ dishes.   With hundreds of Vietnamese restaurants around Calgary, it's the little things that make the difference, and this place does it right.  

I'll be back every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here and it was odd.

The restaurant was moderately busy during the dinner hour. We were seated almost immediately. We sat for more than ten minutes, without menus, until someone walked by and casually asked, \"You've ordered, yes?\" I said, \"No, we weren't given menus.\" She apologized and returned a minute later with menus and waters.

We ordered our food--two rice dishes and two avocado shakes. The avocado shakes were brought out fairly promptly and were delicious. It was another 20 minutes before our food showed up... and we were brought two of the same dish even though we ordered two different dishes. Rather than adding to the chaos and confusion by sending back a dish, we kept it. The dishes were tasty but dry.

When the bill was brought to the table, it was the bill for a different table with an entirely different order.

Based on this visit, I would return to Lemongrass West only if it were convenient; I would not go out of my way to return. The service was slow and sloppy and no effort was made to turn our experience around. The food was not good enough to make up for the service issues."}
{"text":"This was just disappointing. bland bland bland. the salad rolls were hard, and it took forever to get my order, which was wrong. Save yourself some disappointment and go across Richmond Rd to Golden Bell. Way better quality"}
{"text":"This was my second time here for lunch while waiting for my car to get serviced at Honda West (this is a late review; I came here Jan 10 of this year).  I was greeted pleasantly by my server and seated right away (the restaurant wasn't full yet).  Even though she took my order right away, I was pretty much ignored after she brought my pho.   I only ordered two items--charbroiled sate chicken breast and tiger prawns noodle soup(#42) and green tea.   The broth base and shrimp tasted okay, but the chicken was a bit flaccid and half cooked.  It looked like the kitchen staff skipped the charbroiling step!  The server also forgot to bring my tea.  When I flagged her down to remind her, she didn't even apologize!
      This restaurant needs to improve their customer service and food quality, because there are a lot of other great Vietnamese restaurants in town..."}
{"text":"tired of them not getting take out order right.this happens every time we order. I wish they paid more respect to the PAYING customer"}
{"text":"Vermicelli is good at any time of the day.

Let me just start off by admitting that I enjoy Vietnamese cuisine way too much. I could eat vermicelli 7 days a week and not even think about getting tired of it: especially if it was here at Lemongrass West. First we shared some spring rolls and salad rolls amongst the table and they barely lasted a few minutes. They were very fresh and delicious. Then my iced coffee came. I'm not quite sure what it is about the way Vietnamese coffee, ice, and condensed milk mix but it creates this delicious flavour that I just can't resist. Within a few minutes of finishing our rolls, the main dishes arrived. We all had vermicelli bowls and although my friend swears by the pork, I'm not a huge fan of pork so I opted for chicken. The meal was delicious. I found it curious that they use a large bowl with low sides instead of the larger side bowls which I normally see. The small bowl made it considerably easier to eat all of the food. We received good service throughout the meal although the time between ordering and getting the rolls seemed far too long.

I'll have to go back to try their pho, or eat vermicelli 7 days a week..."}
{"text":"Excellent spicy seafood noodle soup and was very impressed by their extensive gluten free selection. 
Only drawback is how horribly slow their kitchen is."}
{"text":"This place is clean, friendly, and their Pho tastes like... well, I'm not really sure. The broth is somewhere between miso and dish water. The meat is not very good either, the rare beef was already chewy, shrivelled and grey when it arrived at the table (rather than pink/red and tender). The noodles are cooked well, but that's about the only high point to this dish. While I'm sure some things are wonderful here, the Pho is a no go. I've tried it on 3 occasions, and all 3 have been disappointing at best."}
{"text":"Stopped here for takeout. The staff weren't attentive at all & seemed rude. Wasn't offered water or a seat. Food took almost 30 minutes& was cold. Wasn't given a fork with my food & when I went back to ask the first server ignored me.."}
{"text":"This is our new go-to place for great Pho and Vietnamese food.  Food is always tasty and quick.  Service is simple and always friendly.  I love the iced coffee :) :) and their spring rolls are great.  Portions are always large and filling and definitely worth the price.  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Review #4 For Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 

I've been here a few times now for some vegan dishes. It's nice that they have a vegetarian and a gluten free section of their menu. Prices are pretty good for what you get. 

Some of the vegetarian options are a tad monotonous as they're all variations of tofu, vegetables and rice or rice noodles. 

I've tried the vegetable tofu noodle soup and the stir fried vegetable tofu vermicelli noodles. The soup is my top choice as I find the stir fried noodles were extremely oily and not very good. I've ordered the soup several times and it never fails to be fresh, healthy and delicious. So I'll definitely keep coming back for that. 

They also serve bubble drinks here which is nice. They can make the drinks without dairy if you ask too."}
{"text":"My go-to Vietnamese place. Been here 100+ and never had a bad experience. Sometimes it's really busy and the service is a bit slow but that's to be expected. In terms of decor and atmosphere, it's one if the nicest in the city. 

Good service, excellent prices, delish food. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Service 1 star, 
Food 2.5 stars
value 1 star

Lots of people here have commented on the horrendous service, so I'll keep it short - after a half hour wait, they managed to get my order wrong three times. The last time, I just ate what they brought, even though it was not what I ordered. (Which was Beef And Spring rolls, shrimp skewer added - 58B on their menu. I ate grilled chicken slices w/ spring rolls.)

Food value? Less than a dollar worth of chicken, grilled poorly on top of vermicelli with a bit of shredded lettuce and carrots and a dozen beansprouts, served with some green tea cost me $17 ($15.75 before tip.) Norm P. says the prices are reasonable? The food cost here is not likely more than $1.50 for the ingredients - in Toronto, I regularly paid under $10 with tip for much, much better, and BTW, much more generous servings. 

Calgarians seem to be willing to pay ridiculous prices for completely mediocre food. And to live with unimaginably bad service. I won't, so I won't be back."}
