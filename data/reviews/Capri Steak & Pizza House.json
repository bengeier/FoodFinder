{"text":"A great selection of pizza, pasta, salad, ribs, and steak items.  The food is delicious and the service is good. Prices are reasonable and worth the value.  I was quite satisfied with my meal and so was our entire party. Bar          adjacent to -  at Andy's Lounge."}
{"text":"I'm leery of giving 5-star ratings, as I believe any business can be reasonably expected to improve in some aspect of its performance. That is not the case with the Capri, as I cannot think of any area in which my experiences there could have been made better. I lived in an apartment nearby for 10 years and have dined there at least 25 or 30 times in the last 15 years, with a number of different companions, including dates, old friends, and business associates. Whatever the situation, the experience had been enhanced by the setting.  The menu is what one would expect at a steak and pizza place; the portions are appropriate - compare to chain places like the Keg, where frozen french fries are doled out of plastic bags and distributed by volume on plates too large for their contents. The offerings include a little something to please everyone, meat, pasta, seafood, with a grill behind glass so you can see dinner being prepared fresh.  I've personally sampled the steaks, which are also done exactly to order, pasta, and pizza, and all have been very good. I'm a big fan of the house salad dressing.  All wait staff I have experienced have been experienced, friendly, and attentive - without being annoying. The restaurant is clean and well-laid out, nicely lit with an ambience and intimacy to the surroundings.  Perhaps if one was to look for a concern, it would be the smallish parking lot in the rear, but parking is free, and I have never been unable to find a spot.  Prices are also what one would expect from a restaurant a step up from Denny's, but the experience was always worth the little bit extra."}
{"text":"I visited Capri for the first time and last time today during lunch for a work Christmas party. Though we had pre-ordered our food, they still could keep track of the of the orders. Our side salads were frozen. I had requested \"house Italian dressing\" which was Ranch - when I looked puzzled and re-stated my dressing request, the server snapped at me and said that was what I had requested and made no effort to see if I would like something else. After most of the members of my table had received their meals, a colleague and I had not received our pasta. We had to call the servers over and alert them to the obvious - that we had not been served lunch. After a further delay, they reported that they had lost our orders and the cooks were making our lunches. Overall, the servers were curt and unfriendly, and the food was below average. When my meal finally arrived, the chicken fettuccini was barely edible, with sauce that tasted like it was straight out of a jar and sickly overcooked broccoli."}
{"text":"The main reason the Capri has been at their location for more than 30 years is because their food is great and reasonably  priced. They are much more than just pizzas. Their steaks and pastas and other dishes are superb. The T bone steak is one of the best in town. The service matches the food."}
{"text":"Food is good and very well priced. Owner and staff are friendly. Parking in the back. Decor is dated but it's apparently been around since 1976. Will return in the future."}
{"text":"Order take out from here regularly.  Baked lasagna and Andy's Special pizza are both great.  Delivery is fast."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is the the inside needs a major upgrade. The food and service are amazing. Definitely a place to try out for pizza, steak or ribs. Try the stuffed Potato, house salad and dressing and the cheese cake!"}
{"text":"A good low-key steakhouse with a somewhat dated feel that seems charming, as places like this are disappearing from the Calgary landscape. I had a New York steak that was quite good and  priced fairly, although I really was looking forward to the t-bone, which I initially ordered but was told they were out of stock. The service was prompt and friendly and unpretentious. Watch out for the guy out back making sure people going to other businesses near by don't park in the Capri lot, at first I thought he was a panhandler."}
{"text":"Ordered take out tonight, had steak and prawns with stuffed potatoes. The steak was amazing! It was so flavourful and juicy, the best! The stuffed potato was very yummy too. I didn't care much for the prawns though. Very good experience overall!"}
{"text":"My daughter was scouting out affordable steak and ribs places  and came across Capri.  She browsed the menu and found her pesco-vegetarian tastes could be accomodated with grilled fish and her GodDad's craving for 'a good steak  or maybe ribs' would be accomodated as well!   So I went ahead and made the reservations.  Lucky we did!  from 7 - 8 on a Friday night the place was packed.  In fact,  our Honoured Birthday guest was impressed that they got there a little early and the owner popped out and offered the two guys sitting at the table a free beer if they'd move to the lounge!   How many places will do that nowadays?  And the drinks are resasonable  with good Canadian Beer on tap and pints at $5.50 who wouldn't go back for pizza and beer?  We're going back to try the pizza.  We all have various menu choices and were more than impressed with the portions.   Their Grill Cook rocks, btw!  Seriously,  my daughter's salmon on her salmon salad was cooked perfectly, as was the salmon in the salmon 'neptune'.  My 'beef' neptune ( a steak) and freind's salmon neptune were made with REAL Hollandaise sauce.  The prime rib and other steaks were expertly cooked and thick cut..   And REAL creamy deliciously seasoned, not frozen stuffed potatoes were absolutely the best we've had in years!  No extra sour cream or other condiments necesseary on those lovely potatoes! The Fettucine Al Fredo looked wonderful and came with a salad too! Okay, if you're a vegan epicure, heads  up here.  This  wonderful 1970's style menu is not for you.  You'll be disappointed in the old style iceberg lettuce salad with  a little tomato and a little cuke with a traditional choice of  dressing.  You won't like the vegetable medley that is the standard side, but that is not Capri's forte!   Capri is all about the beef and ribs and pizza!   They balance their meals the way it was done back when the grill chef was king of the kitchen! And it's for folks who didn't need a waiter to tell them which reduction, emulision, and fancy greens or fruit or  peppercorn was added to their dish to make it worth the $$$.  Capri's prices are competitive,  their food is filling, their  portions are generous and their service deserves every one of those five stars!  And it is a  Calgary landmark.  Oh and wear your walking shoes.   Parking is not the easiest thing to find nearby because the restaurant is located right on the  corner of  Edmonton Trail and 16 Ave.  There is parking behind but it's  laneway backing on to a park and it was crowded and busy the night we went.   This is one Capri fan who hopes the Capri will be around for some time to come!"}
{"text":"we had a birthday dinner here.  The steak came out slathered in sauce.  There was something off about the steaks.  I think the owner is keeping them for way too long, to the point where they are almost rotting.  THE only plus is that there is a window to watch your steak being fired.  The chef couldn't seem to cook a steak, which is a big problem across almost any kitchen.  If the chef isn't using a thermometer to get exact temperatures, and then learning that technique for 20+ years, they arn't going to miraculously put out perfect steaks everytime.   We ordered a medium and welldone, the medium came rare, and the weldone came medium.  I know this exactly because i only cook steaks with disposable or electronic thermometers, checking temperatures uniformly throughout a steak, I've done it enough to know exactly what a steak looks like when its cooked to 'medium' temperature, and to 'welldone' temperature, rare who cares, sear it and eat it if you like rare, or just eat the meat raw, why bother going out, go get a steak and throw it in a dog dish, dont even use your hands.  So the rare was so putrid, I could barley chew a bite of it.  And I asked for it to be redone.   They just tried cooking it more on the grill, I told them no, to make a new one.  Dumb owners dont understand that if you dont lose some money they will never correct the issue, even if it took all day and night i'd tell them to make new ones.  When the 2nd one came back, it was actually done properly, but was half the size, seems they dont know how to cook a steak or what proportions people ordered.  I'll never be going back.  The only good thing I ate was the veggies(bland) garlic bread (butter on toast) and the zuchini (breaded zuchini deep fried)"}
{"text":"I have gone there with people on a number of occasions for dinner and drinks to accompany our meetings / get togethers.  One time not many people ordered much more than tea and the next time I came in I was berated by the manager about having meetings there and that he has to pay staff to serve me and the group I came with I was so caught off guard and upset I almost wanted to leave despite being hungry and planning on buying food as I usually had over the last few times I had gone. I will avoid this restaurant in the future and will no longer suggest it as I had in the past. The wait staff on the other hand is fantastic and so kind and pleasant. Personal pizzas are pretty good but I have such a sour taste on my mouth that I would rather spend my money else where and will plan future meet up's with friends in other venues."}
{"text":"I haven't had Capri in years, but from what I remember it was very good! My parents used to take me here when I was a little girl, I'm going to go to this restaurant again soon and will update my review on it. I'm sure it will stay the same (or maybe even get 5 stars) who knows!"}
{"text":"Let me just say this place is ancient, my grandmother raves about this place and she's no spring chicken! But onto the review, I've not been let down here the wait staff are really friendly! The food is like homemade foods so they are hearty and tasty as hell! They have a little grill booth thing so you can see them cooking the steaks and meet which is kinda neet? I usually get a pizza and they are to die for! They steaks are prepared expertly!   Pros -tasty foods -friendly staff  -cozy feel  Cons -old and kinda showing its age -parking is torture"}
