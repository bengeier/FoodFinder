{"text":"This place was actually amazing when they first opened back in 2007. Nathan was the chef and his dishes were great. His combination of dishes and the wine list they had went together very well and the staff was very educated on wine suggestions by dish. It helped that you could order 3 ounce glasses of wine that were the perfect size for a smaller tapas dish.   Some of the food that I kept going back for were the Garlic Prawns, the \"fig and pig\" Coca, the Roquefort cigarillos, the cheese platter, and the meat platter of chorizo, horse, prosciutto and whatever else they had which was served with these amazing mustards that made your mouth water. Nathan was a superb chef and had a great handle on how food should be cooked. I looked forward to the nightly specials which were usually on top of the olive bar (stuffed peppers, tomato and garlic toasts, etc). I also feel in love with his chocolate pudding that had a slight hint of heat. It was a real treat.   Unfortunately Nathan left the restaurant last year to pursue other opportunities and that's when this restaurant started going downhill. They changed a lot of the dishes, and I'm not sure the cooks know how to grill a steak. Overdone and rubbery! Its like everything they make is missing something...its just not there. The kept some of the dishes but seemed to change them. The Garlic Prawns which Nathan's team cooked with a white wine garlic sauce (and bread to mop up all the juices) were now drenched in too much pepper. We went back twice because we thought it might have been an off night for the cook, however we were disappointed again. Prices seem to have gone up, but the food was still less than acceptable.   Coca is now closed and there is a notice that they are under new management. When they relaunch and open again, I'm not sure I will go back. I think when they lost Nathan, they lost what made that place amazing.   If you asked me to rate this in 2007 I would have given it 5 stars. Unfortunately now I can only give it 1 star. I don't think the patrons of Queen West will bring enough business for this place to survive. Not when there are plenty of other restaurants in that area that are fantastic."}
{"text":"I have to say I was really disappointed in this place. Quite frankly, I believe calling something a 'tapas bar' is just an excuse to serve less food at the same price. I felt like everything here was over priced and the food wasn't filling or tasty.   I went with two friends and we split some olives and salted nuts which were pretty boring. Then we shared some flat bread, and some chicken dishes but nothing was blow your mind delicious. And although it's \"tapas\" and the dishes are smaller, the prices sure didn't seem to be.   I understand the concept of small Spanish dishes but there was nothing spectacular about this food and I certainly wouldn't go back there again."}
