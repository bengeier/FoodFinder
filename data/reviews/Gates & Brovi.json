{"text":"I'm a fan half the time I go and the other half of the time I consider never coming back.  They have reasonable seafood/oysters and decent beer selection.  The service is very hit-or-miss.  Salmon burger is good;  the bluegill is usually bad.   Mussels are pretty good, a different spin on the usual broth."}
{"text":"Good food. Neat atmosphere. I would love to go back again soon! I went after a Badger game with a few friends who had been recommending this place for months and I can see why! The d√©cor and building is cool. We had to park a couple blocks away, but I feel like it was worth the walk."}
{"text":"Great veggie burger that is vegan too!  Even came with a side of vegan coleslaw :)  Been back a few times now and the kitchen is more than accommodating :)"}
{"text":"This place is ok, but for a great burger, go to Everly or the Laurel.  Be warned that there is a large kid contingency here, which is great if you have kids, but is not for everyone.  The appetizers need work.  That being said, it's a cute space and I like that they open their windows and door on nice days."}
{"text":"Very good. Casual atmosphere. No nonsense, brief menu. The portions are perfect (no one needs a half pound burger). The ribeye sandwich was delicious tonight. Great atmosphere, mix of old WI supper club and sports bar. The name could be more appealing though."}
{"text":"Solid.  Madison needs good seafood places. Its good.  Not great.  Nothing spectacular to me, though my party disagreed, but the service is good, the happy hour specials are great.  Parking is iffy but its on Monroe street so whatcha gonna do.  I ordered the pizza with the clams on it (forgot the name).  Solid.  wasn't amazing.  Wasn't mind blowing.  Came out nice and fresh.    Wife had the G&B burger and she said it was one of the best burger's she's ever had.  I had one bite of it.  Thought it was better than average but wasn't a \"destination dish.\"  (Of which I am still searching for in Madison).  Calamari was average.  Kid friendly with a decent kid's menu.  Solid place.  You can't go wrong.  Your mind won't be blown but on the other hand I don't think this place is vying for that."}
{"text":"Not a place I will come back to.  Hardly any gluten free options, with a menu that is less than exciting.  Burgers, sandwiches, fried fish (no baked), no fresh juice for cocktails and the same fried food you can get any other chain barf hole.  Very disappointing coming from Sardine."}
{"text":"Awful meal. Got the half roast chicken w/ potatoes and greens. The chicken was overlooked to the point of the Turkey in National Lampoon's 'Christmas Vacation\"....some of the thigh meat literally broke when I cut it.  Potatoes were undercooked. The greens were tasty but also undercooked.  Our waitress was pretty weak, too. Barely even paying attention to us. No utensils, wrong menu.  They buttered the pasta for the kids even though we asked them not to.  And the iced tea could have taken the paint off my car, it was so wretched.  Not worth another visit."}
{"text":"I'm thrilled to have G&B within walking distance of my house.  As others have commented, the interior is gorgeous.  It reminded me of a Door County restaurant, one of those that has been there for ages.   The menu is not extensive, but there is enough variety that everyone in your party should be able to find something they would be happy with.  In fact, I think the menu choices do a great job of covering a lot of different preferences with a minimum of options.  I have been to other restaurants with far more extensive menus and found fewer choices that were appealing to me -- I don't eat red meat or poultry but I do eat seafood and fish.  In some restaurants I may have a single option on a very large menu, yet at G&B there are several I could eat.  I have eaten there twice -- very good, not \"gourmet\" but a cut above the regular bar/sandwich place for sure.  I am not sure I understand the critiques of other reviewers who downgrade G&B for being the kind of restaurant it is, rather than the kind of restaurant they wish it was.  If it's a casual local gathering place, then that's what it is.  And not everyone wants a big haystack of fries automatically with their sandwich.  It's wasteful.  The cole slaw that is served with the sandwiches lacks flavor, in part because it is dished into the serving cups long before it is served so the dressing sinks to the bottom.  If you don't know this and don't stir it up before you eat it, you get plain cabbage for the first few bites.  Even so, the dressing is pretty bland.  As I'm not a sophisticated drinker the lack of a drink/beer menu doesn't  bother me, but I get how that should be remedied.  My only other issue with the place is not the fault of G&B but with the patrons.  Both times I have been there, parents have allowed small children to scream and/or run around while they sat either oblivious to the behavior or assuming other patrons would find this adorable.  There are clueless people everywhere but casual dining is rife with them."}
{"text":"Service was just fine in this family friendly restaurant i.e. entrees in plastic baskets, condiments in paper cups etc   The menu would benefit greatly from a few more healthy entree options - more salads - maybe a nightly fish special that isn't deep fried?    We ordered the Beer Boiled Shrimp entree, the Cod Sandwich, Chicken Tenders for the kids, a basket of fries, the Wedge Salad and your Bean and Sausage soup of the night..oh and the cheese curds, because we're Wisconsinites.  It all tasted fine but a side of veggies as an option would have been greatly appreciated!!  or fruit!    My husband stopped in for the Wednesday Chicken special last week and loved it - we are also looking forward to trying the Friday night Fish Fry   Please do add some more salads to your menu and some vegetables with the entrees!    Thanks!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Sardine (my go-to date night restaurant) and Marigold (who doesn't want a chili poached egg for breakfast?), so in my world having G&B move into the neighborhood felt like an early Christmas present. I would drive by and imagine being able to walk home after dinner with my roommate. My roommate and I would talk about our new favorite restaurant, as if it were already open and we were regulars. We were friends with the imaginary bartenders who worked there. I tried to convince my boyfriend's niece to apply for a job there. I was excited. Really.   First Attempt: Gates & Brovi apparently aspires to the family friendly sports bar vibe. Great. Perfect style for the neighborhood. I am there with 2 friends. We are excited!   Here's the problem: the menu is dumbed down to the point that not one, but both dinner companions picked up the menu, skimmed, flipped it over (to reveal no flipside), and said 'Did they give us the kid's menu?' Both. Same line.   Appetizers are almost universally fried and include items easily accessible in the frozen foods section at Copps. Lovely. Wow, ranch dressing for dip? How innovative. Burgers and sandwiches--again, I can make these options (really) at home. On a weeknight. For children who would actually eat them because there are no 'weird' ingredients (Like vegetables. Or creative sauces. Or creative toppings. Or creativity, full stop). Option to add 'weird' ingredients? No. I understand that this is a family oriented restaurant, but there are burger and sandwich joints less than a mile away (ahem...Laurel, V, Jac's) that serve kid friendly food without the condescension of this menu. If this restaurant were unrelated to Sardine and Marigold, it would be a disappointment. As it stands, it's offensive.  Moving on...We order one of two non-fried appetizers on the menu-- crab dip with veggies. Comes in a shallow, wide metal dish which, go figure with the dish selection, was instantly lukewarm and congealed. Veggies were 3 carrot sticks and 3 celery sticks, cut so thin they curled. Looks of dismay were exchanged. These are the same owners who serve the lovely fritto and chicken liver crostini, no? Surely they can identify an appropriate serving utensil and cut the veggies thick enough to hold shape. We also tried the shrimp fritters-- if fry is the primary menu option, embrace it, no? Meh. Not bad, not great...the point is, not memorable.  At this same meal, drinks are ordered. Drinks menu? No. Beers on tap? Couldn't hear the waitress (oh wait, this is the one thing G&B has in common with Sardine and Marigold-- exceptionally poor acoustics). Is there at least a list of the tap and bottle beer? Don't have one, \"but we have pretty much anything you can think of by the bottle\". Great. Could my friend have a Crispin? \"We don't have that\". Ah. At this point we ordered a round a Spotted Cow (state beverage, apparently), gave up on the limp veggies and cold crab dip and half eaten shrimp fritters, and declared a hiatus. Surely the restaurant will improve, we thought.   Second Attempt: Cut to 10 days later. Brainwave! It's a kid restaurant-- I'll bring a kid! I just had a bad attitude! It's going to be awesome!   Have they now written a beverage menu? Not yet. Boyfriend and kid (aka focus group of one) pick up food menus, turn them over, look confused, and simultaneously say, \"Is this it?\". No, I did not prep them. Back to the lousy acoustics. Two \"whatever that first one you said\"s are ordered along with a root beer float and cheese curds. Root beer float arrives with a bottle of root beer and purple silly straw-- lovely. I was wrong. G&B is redeemed.   Wait...is that a puddle of grease at the bottom of those curds? And why are they all stuck together? Darn it! But no, I will stay positive. Burgers are ordered-- this is a burger joint, their burgers are going to be inspired in their simple perfection!  All will be forgiven! Oh...they don't come with a side? A Dixie cup of coleslaw? Okay! Sounds great! $10.50 for a burger and side of small fries! Grilled onions? Yum! Oh wait, you put raw onions on instead. Special sauce? Couldn't find it. Was it that penny-sized dot on the bottom of the bun? I can't say if it was 'special'. I couldn't taste it (see previous onion issue). Gooey melty cheese....so pass√©. Apparently the new way to serve burgers is with cold, unmelted cheese squares. Mmmmm.   Kid verdict? Float finished, half a burger left uneaten. This is a teenage boy. The focus group has spoken.  Adult verdict? I hate you for getting me so excited, for so many months, with my fantasies about my 'new favorite restaurant' (within walking distance!), and for then being awful. I hate you for being related to Marigold and Sardine and for making me expect more from you. Ugh.  I give you two stars. One for the root beer-- the straw was cool (plus no-one got food poisoning, so hey, that's something). One for the awesome skeleton lawn flamingo I got next door at Mallatt's."}
{"text":"Not a good restaurant! Nice atmosphere. The food is over priced, not very good, and it's not even served on a plate. Really? I was disappointed enough in it that I decided to post a review!"}
{"text":"First of all the parking is horrible.  Why they put a restaurant without adequate parking is beyond me.  Then it was so noisy that conversation was almost to the shouting point.  I had the pulled pork - soggy soggy soggy with lots of grease.  Asked the waiter what the dark greens were on the bottom of the sandwich - collard greens?!?!?  Not very appetizing to say the least.  Had to take 4 Tums when I got home because my stomach was churning - and I couldn't even eat half of what I was served. Never again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great tap beer selection - the cold Canadian Pilsner washed down the tasty shrimp fritters and oysters very nicely. Atmosphere is casual and kid-friendly. Avoid sitting near the door on a cold day. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Terrific food, comfortable and unique atmosphere, and excellent staff. I highly recommend the Tom & Jerry in winter and the cheese curds just about any time of year!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch here with my 4 year old son.  Was greeted with prompt service and some crayons for my son.  I had the pan fried bluegill belt and it was very tasty.  The pimento cheese spread was a nice touch.  The kids chicken tenders were lightly seasoned and crispy.  The cheese curds were great and the ranch based dipping sauce was spot on.     Overall a nice ambiance with the lighting and reclaimed wood.  Parking requires a bit of a walk and would be enough to keep me from coming during peak hours"}
{"text":"I thought the fried shrimp were amazing!   Definitely family friendly but for a busy Saturday night I was surprised kids got bar seats.  The space is kind of a nautical theme and very cozy.  Service was fast and food was yummy.  I'd like to try the fish fry."}
{"text":"Visiting with the kids and had dinner here again at my request. Great beer selection and tasty cocktails. Friday fish cod and blue gill very good. Beet and endive salad fresh and crisp. Will return."}
{"text":"Went here last night and had a great time, great food and great service. We started off with a dozen blue point oysters (only $1 each during happy hour), cheese curds and drinks. The oysters were incredibly fresh and very good. Nate, the owner, said he gets the oysters in 5 times a week from the east coast. The cheese curds were light, flakey, delicious.   Our first order of oysters was quickly sucked down our gullets so we ordered another dozen and the artichoke dip. Yummy! More drinks and then a dozen beer steamed shrimp. The shrimp had a really great flavor! and they came in a steamy broth that kept them hot and flavorful until the last one was eaten.   The service was incredible. Tara, our waitress, took very good care of the four of us. I'm definitely going back back to Gates & Brovi soon."}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood restaurant! I've been a few times now, with girlfriends, family and on a date with my hubby. All great experiences! We had to wait a bit this past weekend for a table but there was room at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and quickly helped us. Once we got our table, the waitress was as equally accommodating and friendly. I ordered the GF shrimp & chorizo pasta and my husband had the fish BLT, both were delicious! The decor is comfy and hip. I highly recommend Gates & Brovi."}
{"text":"When I first went to Gates and Brovi a few months ago, I was an almost instant fan. The restaurant is a a good place to go with a family or group of friends, especially with the two large picnic-style tables that are fun for groups of friends or a party.  The food is American, with a menu that sways towards being seafood-centered. Indeed, the seafood is reasonably good for a land-locked area.  The d√©cor is an interesting and fresh take on a north woods supper club combined with what seems to be a New England clam shack or seafood place. The owners took these two modest but character-filled venues and spiffed it up a ton, with high ceilings and large windows that fill the room with natural light at lunchtime. Hardwood floors and vintage north woodsy shiny beer signs give the place a nostalgic but also cool and fresh look. Most design elements are tasteful and a good bit kitschy. The seating is mostly wooden, so it takes a little bit of a hit on comfort. However, there is a table and seating that can please everybody. There are traditional tables and chairs, bar stools at the bar, booths, high padded seats around a table,  and even two wood picnic tables that I mentioned earlier.  Recently, Gates and Brovi expanded their menu to a double-sided page, which added lots of items that can appeal to many tastes. The crowd favorite, and one that I would highly recommend for any newcomer to this restaurant, is the G & B burger. It is divine, with a delicious sauce and a goey, drippy, richness. As with a good amount of their other menu items, the burger requires more than a few of the flimsy paper napkins. Also good to try is the beer steamed shrimp. Soaking in a delicious -broth? -brine? each shrimp absorbs loads of rich flavor, and compensates for the average seafood that is served. Appetizers are delicious and there is a good amount to choose from. The fries are a good thing to automatically get if you are with other people, because the large size comes with a lot and is the cheapest of the appetizers.   The fries are perfectly hot and crispy and have just the right amount of oiliness. My brother had the cheese curds one time and said they were very awesome. One downside is that the brown sugar roasted pork sandwich is so choked with greens and a soggy slop that it was hard to pick out the pork flavor, which didn't have that much flavor anyway (Where was the brown sugar part of it? I couldn't taste it). Many things are very messy and soggy and require lots of napkins. There is one mediocre paper napkin that comes with your silverware but that runs out pretty quickly. There are dispensers on each table, but each napkin that comes out of those is so flimsy and thin that you end up having a huge pile of wadded-up paper at the end of your meal.  Service is a strong point, with wait staff that are friendly and courteous. When my mother got the wine she ordered, it came not quite as chilled as some might like it. The waitress was very helpful and offered to refrigerate it for longer, which worked. When the wine came back, it was a good deal colder but still in a non-stemmed beer-like glass. Apparently they do not have stemmed glasses for wine, so you have to have it in a regular beer sampler glass.  Other users have mentioned parking being a problem, although I live close and usually walk there. It is true that there is no parking lot in the daytime, and you have to resort to side streets. After 7:00 you can park in the Mallatt's parking lot, which is right next to the restaurant. Along with their expanded menu, they also added a parking diagram which handily points out which streets are good to park on.  All in all, this is a great place to take the family, or the relatives in town, or anybody for that matter. The food is amazing, especially for the price you pay and the portion size you get. If you are looking for your next place to eat in Madison, swing on by to Gates and Brovi."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Really just a concept restaurant with meh food and kitschy decor. OK as a local bar hangout and no more. So many other options especially on Monroe St!"}
{"text":"This is a nice neighborhood place with good food and a cozy atmosphere.  The cheese curds were flavorful and not over breaded.  The shrimp I had was fresh and firm.  The service was fast and friendly.  I didn't give it 5 stars because parking was a pain and it was really noisy in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I really had high hopes about this place. It looks nice from the outside. The space inside was very open, high ceilings, lots of light from the windows. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful.   However: The parking situation is a nightmare. No parking lot. If you go at about 5:00-5:30 like we did, good luck. We had to park 2 blocks away. It is mind-boggling to me that the city zoning board would approve this place without parking.  Then there is the food. I ordered New England Clam Chowder. Well, there were clams, but the broth was thin, and there were all these vegetables that made it taste more like minestrone. Why would somebody do this? Reminds me of people who make guacamole with about three cloves of garlic and bury any avocado taste. So then I ordered their slow-roasted roast beef sandwich. Same kind of deal, there was so much other stuff in there I was not sure I wasn't eating a Muffaletta sandwich. If I wanted that I would not have ordered roast beef.  Last but not least, almost all the seats were wooden. Not all that comfortable.   I don't feel good about rating this new place so low, but damn, they sure did not impress."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood hangout,  Always such a warm, vibrant, and inviting feel, and the food is very good.  The owners are great people, and run several excellent local restaurants (Sardine, Marigold, G&B).  Great beer list, plenty of TVs for watching the game, and a great place to socialize, relax, and have a nice meal.  The menu boasts several dishes you don't frequently see these days, including fried smelt and a bluegil BLT sandwich, both of which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had the best drink in Madison here! The menu is short but enough for me and my girlfriends to select different varieties to try. All have great presentation and taste. Looking forward to come by again!!"}
{"text":"I have been there a few times and the first few times I was a huge fan of the roasted garlic chicken.  It was juicy inside, the \"greens\" were flavorful as were the red roasted potatoes; however, on two subsequent separate visits, the bottom burger bun was so filled with grease or juice that it disintegrated and I had to eat it with a knife and fork, which cut through the paper that lined the plastic serving basket, which they swear they clean in a dishwasher.  I was still skeptical that eating a burger on that plastic surface was sanitary.  The service was poor.  The plastic \"glass\" that was served had a big chip in it at the top/lip.  I was comped for the meal after asking for the manager.  On a subsequent lunch visit with a friend, we had a terrible waitress, (petite with pulled back blonde hair), who excused our 50 minute wait for our food with \"it got busy\" when it was not busy upon our arrival at 12:05 on a weekday.  Then, there was the excuse that the chefs were behind.  (Hence, it was someone else's fault, but not hers - no apology). None of this was communicated to us until we flagged her attention as she never came by to check on us and we were sitting outside the kitchen doors! When the food did arrive, the roast chicken I ordered arrived with french fries instead of roast red potatoes, and I said I had not ordered fries.  It was brought by the manager of the moment I think.  He insisted I had ordered fries.  I told him to take them off the plate after repeating I had not ordered fries.  The rest of the food was returned on a smaller plate, which made it difficult to cut the half chicken. Then the terrible waitress appeared again after he left and said that the kitchen was out of red potatoes.  Again, someone else's fault, not hers.  After I finished my chicken, she reappeared with a bowl of boiled, not roasted red potatoes, so someone was either lying about the kitchen being out of them or someone made a quick run to a grocery store.  She came beaming back to us with the checks and told me very proudly that I had been comped for my meal.  That is what should have happened.  In my dismayed state of mind, I inadvertently tipped her, which was not my intention at all.  She did not deserve a tip other than she should find another job.  While I was originally so happy to find a restaurant that had roast chicken on the menu, I just cannot waste any more time patronizing this place again, nor can I recommend it.  I had talked it up so much to my friend who was with me that I was embarrassed that I had done so and I felt compelled to apologize to him.  His meal should have been comped as well.  After all, we both waited 50 minutes for our \"food\"."}
{"text":"A theme of East Coast beach from the 70s. This place was doomed from the start. Fried. Expensive. Zip for vegetarians. Obnoxious presence in the neighborhood with no parking. How soon will it go away?"}
{"text":"REALLY?  This place is related to Sardine and Marigold?  Seriously?  I live 2 blocks from G&B, and like others, was so excited to finally have a restaurant close enough for a quick walk and bite on a regular basis.    Bottom line, unless there are MAJOR changes, I will not be back.  Here's what's wrong with the place, in my opinion:  MENU:  very small selection of what appears to be extremely mundane, uncreative food.  I can easily make burgers and sandwiches at home - why would I go out for a tuna melt?  And I'm unlikely to spend upwards of $30 in a noisy, sports bar environment for lobster  PRICE:  quite overpriced for very mediocre food (go to the Laurel or Village Bar if you want a decent burger at a decent price!)  SERVING SIZE:  are you kidding me?  for $7.50 you get of a 6x3\" piece of focaccia with roasted eggplant and cheese?  I'd expect at least double this for the price.  My dining companion and I both left hungry (we both ordered the roasted eggplant sandwich and split a large order of fries)  SIDES:  the meager eggplant sandwich came with a pickle spear, some odd pickled pepper and about 2 tablespoons of coleslaw.  For the price, fries, salad or other sides should be included  FOOD QUALITY:  seemed okay, nothing special.  I saw no mention or evidence of local, organic or other quality ingredients.  If you're looking for an excellent burger, go to the Weary Traveller for the Bob's Bad Breath Burger...it's a way better value, includes 1/2 pound of organic beef, plus incredible sides...all for less than the cost of the G&B burger with side purchase of fries)  SPECIALS:  how about adding some specials for every night, not just Wed and Fri?  AMBIENCE:  way too noisy.  The cold air from inside rushes in every time the doors are open, there is no double/enclosed entryway.  In the winter, I suspect this place will be impossibly cold and drafty.  PARKING:  PIty the people that live in the immediate vicinity of this restaurant, they will no longer be free from slamming car doors and cars parked in front of their houses and increased traffic.  Cars are everywhere, and parking is a nightmare.  DO NOT park in the Metro bus area on the north side of Monroe Street. A car was being ticketed and towed as we were leaving - the parking person said this happens all the time now...a nice $90 addition to someone's dinner bill - OUCH!  Why isn't the restaurant concerned about this and helping their customers avoid a ticket (a simple sign might help).  Additionally, cars for G&B are parking on the south side of Monroe Street, making passage through the light difficult.  On a recent evening, my boyfriend had to wait through at least 6 light changes to get to the traffic signal; traffic was backed up a block beyond the intersection with Odana, and left turns at the light with the parked cars made it impossible to pass through the intersection.  UGH! There is a 6 car covered lot behind the building with nearly impossible maneuverability.  If you have a Smart Car, you're good to go - use it!  Three of the stalls were empty when we tried to park there, and the place was packed.  Apparently, most people have not discovered the lot yet.  On the good side: Our server was nice, the food arrived in a timely manner, and I love the idea of reclaimed materials used in construction.  The exterior of the building is appealing and there are lots of windows.  I am guessing this restaurant will have a good following, even if nothing changes.  I won't be going back, however, until G&B steps it up a bit.  Sorry.  I would have given 1/2 a star or zero if it let me."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, had the calamari, fisherman's stew and cod cakes. Very, very good, especially the stew. Think they are serving Batch Bakehouse bread with the meal, as good as it gets."}
{"text":"I give G&B a 3 and 1/2 stars.  Their servers deserve a 5-they are always welcoming, attentive and pretty cool!  Although their menu has improved since they opened it still is nowhere near the unique, fresh and interesting food  served at their other establishments.   I will recommend the salmon burger and my husband is a fan of their homemade sausage pizza.   The bluegill is nothing special and there are no sides except coleslaw or pickle that accompany most dishes.  I was excited when I heard they were opening gut breakfast on the weekends but we were underwhelmed.  High prices for typical breakfast fare.   If they start adding more locally sourced fresh options I think they would attract more customers."}
{"text":"Yummy food, love the oysters, my wife and son love the chicken tenders. Saut√©ed green beans are good as well. Service is good, nice buzz in the restaurant. Really like this place. Happy hour 3-6tues -Friday. Oysters are 1.25 each Yum"}
{"text":"Gates and Brovi was okay. A bit pricy for what you're getting. We started with cheese curds. They were okay. Then we ordered the sausage and artichoke pizza to share, which sounded awesome, but didn't taste great. It had a very strong vinegar-y taste, which I did not enjoy. The crust was nice, though. They had a strawberry rhubarb pie that we couldn't resist ordering for desert and it was pretty disappointing. It was served cold and I was expecting a warm piece of pie. Overall just not my favorite experience."}
{"text":"Beautiful place! My brunch buddy and I tried the bluegill sandwich and the salmon burger. Both cooked to perfection. Sauces and toppings were perfect, not overpowering. My friend had blueberry pie and was smitten. Recommend his to everyone. Great drink menu, even for brunches. They do need to work a bit on the Bloody Mary. It tasted like a pre-made tomato mix. Go fresh, guys!"}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in town for business... Right across the street from Arbor House my fav spot to stay... Food is incredible, fresh and innovative. Had the salmon burger this week rocked my world!!! Got persuaded to try dessert and found out their pie baker won the Wisconsin State Fair for his pies!!! Peach caramel pie. I'm quite sure one if the best things I've ever eaten! Ever!"}
{"text":"It was fine. Wasn't great, but wasn't terrible. I got a pizza, which was somehow incredibly salty. Curds are good. Wings are pretty good. Beer selection is very good. Service is fine. Very kid-friendly."}
{"text":"Let's Start of with a nice Atmosphere and ambience, the service was also good and helpful. The food was great, it was really fresh and well seasoned! Gates and Brovi had many options I had a small Mushroom and onions pizza with Parmesan cheese and arugula! It was really good!"}
{"text":"I had the same disappointing experience as other reviewers here. Being a big fan of Marigold Kitchen and Sardine, I had high expectations. The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, although loud. The menu is quite limited. As for the food, the batter on the fish fry was not completely cooked, leaving it soggy. Fries were average and didn't add anything to the meal; they are just filler. Salads are decently sized but over-dressed. Service was just o.k. Prices are reasonable. I also agree with the other comments that this place needs to figure out what it wants to be; right now, there is no focus or clear vision. I had been anticipating the opening of G&B for some time and really wanted to like it. I hope they get their act together."}
{"text":"I definitely second the previous review on the SMELT! A huge amount for an \"appetizer\". Perfectly cooked and seasoned and the tartar \"sauce\" on the side was perfect. I bet there were 50 little fish on the platter. Split it with a friend, but I know I got at least 30. He had the Bluegill BLT which he deemed fantastic. I had that the last time, so I got the shrimp salad roll with hot mango jam. Perfect transition from the smelt. I do believe I might just have to sneak in some day again for a lunch and order a whole order of smelt just for me. Don't miss this place...it's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Okay, first let me say that any place that has fried smelt on their regular menu is off to a roaring start with me. It was actually the reason we came to G&B in the first place (I had read a review elsewhere that mentioned it).  My companion and I started with the clam chowder. On ordering, we specifically asked if it was a New England (cream-based) chowder. We were told that it was, but...yeah...not so much. It was...tan, I guess. So not New England and not exactly Manhattan (tomato-based), either. I don't know whether there was cheese in it or what, but the broth had \"broken,\" so it was sort of gritty. And the vegetables (onions, carrots, and a ridiculous amount of celery) were cut in large chunks, instead of a nice, manageable dice. I also didn't notice any clams. Not exactly a hit - and it made me a trifle concerned about what our entrees would be like. I needn't have worried.  My companion ordered the G&B burger - with an upcharge for cheddar (instead of American) and bacon. Wow - delicious. Perfectly cooked (both burger and bacon) and wonderfully juicy. It came with a side of cole slaw. Slightly creamy, but definitely more of a vinegar-based slaw. My guy was less enthused about this than I (he's definitely a creamy cole slaw man). I thought it had a nice tang.  We had a side of fries and they were great. Perfectly brown and very flavorful.  Now...the smelt. First, the portion is very generous. Plenty for sharing if ordered as an app, more than enough for a meal if you're eating it by yourself. The batter is light and nicely seasoned. This is a must for smelt, because the small fish can be easily overwhelmed by too much batter or breading. On the side, both cocktail sauce (with a pronounced hit of horseradish - yum) and what I would characterize as a tartar \"dressing.\" Same flavors as tartar sauce, but with the consistency of ranch dressing. Again, very nice for smelt - much easier for dipping.  The decor is charming - sort of east coast boat house with a side of industrial. We were lucky to be there at a later lunch time - we were able to park right on Monroe and didn't have to hunt for a space on a side street. I can imagine the parking situation is tougher in the evening - especially in winter.  Please, G&B - keep the smelt on the menu. I want to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Gates & Brovi is no Sardine, nor is it Marigold Kitchen.  But, with the success of those excellent establishments behind it, this neighborhood pub with family fare, is a sure bet.  In the month since G & B opened, I have wandered down there about about a dozen times.  Am I related to the owners?  No, I am an area resident, who enjoys sitting at the bar with a great Bloody Mary and a basket of yummy cheese curds.  And the ranch dressing is not only something for the kiddies!  Sometimes I'll have the blue cheese burger, or the steamed shrimp, while watching young and old greet each in a warm and inviting atmosphere.   Any new restaurant merits a second visit, as it continues to fine tune its operation.  Gates & Brovi is no exception.  Perhaps I'll see you there."}
{"text":"Much of my criticism and compliments have already been detailed very nicely by others, so I will just summarize in bullet points.  1. Great location for walkers, inconvenient for those driving from other neighborhoods. Given that it is geared toward the neighborhood and repeat customer base... (see number 2) 2. Very limited menu selection. Literally turned the menu over to see what was on the back, only to find it empty, thought to myself, 'is this a kids' menu?' Turns out that is what everyone at the table was thinking too. 3. In response to my request for a drink list, our server replied, \"We have every beer you can think of in bottle.\" False. Who wants to play the game, \"Do you have {insert beer}\" repeatedly in a noisy crowded restaurant? Write it down or memorize it and be able to tell me all of them. 4. A basket of individually wrapped saltine crackers like one would find at a salad bar is NOT an acceptable bread item to serve with hot crab dip. Just cut the carrots and celery into adult human size, give enough of them, and/or add some nice crostini. 5. The clam chowder is very good. 6. The shrimp fritters are pretty good.  I am interested to see if the owners read their own reviews and improve the quality of food and service. It really is a great location, and I so eagerly awaited their opening."}
{"text":"I live close to here, so you'd think that we go to G&B a lot, but we actually don't. It's not bad food, not by a long shot, but we just don't go here that often. I will state a bad point from my point of view: the menu is limited. On one side it's sandwiches and burgers and the other side is just pizza.  So when I went here for the first couple times there was no food on the menu that appealed to me, so I ended up sharing with my family and having fries and sipping Pepsi. But then I went with my dad one time, and I just said, \"You know what? I'm just gonna go for it.\" I ordered a G&B burger, which is this monstrous burger with two patties and the works. Tomato, onion, bacon, two kinds of sauce, lettuce, and two slices of American, Swiss or Cheddar cheese, your choice. I am not exaggerating when I say it was by far the best thing that involved grilled beef slapped between bread (aka a hamburger) that I have ever tasted in my life. It was heavenly. I ended up barely finishing it because it was just that big.  The pizza is amazing for a place that doesn't specialize in pizza. They have classics, and then they plop on sausage and other goodies to get you on your knees begging. The fries are, in my opinion, the best in Madison and the surrounding area, and the cheese curds are way up on the list too. The chicken tenders as an appetizer are delicious as well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the small menu and I'm also not a huge fan of the ambiance."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to G and B on a Sat. noon. The place was empty to our surprise but tables quickly began to fill one by one. When the waiter began to take orders he skipped around the room with no system to his madness. We were sitting there watching and wondering why people arriving after us had their orders taken before us. (Even a table of 8). In other words he was taking orders helter skelter. He took all the orders in the room on a pad of paper without turning one order into the kitchen. The kitchen staff was standing there looking out the window  watching the waiter. Probably thinking it would be nice to be able to have at least one of those orders. When my wife finally ordered........ a medium burger the waiter told he \"sorry they only come well done\". Having never heard this before in my life I ask for an explaination and was told \" it's easier for the kitchen that way\". My wife and I told the waiter thanks anyway and left............ Oh yes the decor was great! Sorry  to have to report this because Sardine and Marigold are two of our favorites."}
{"text":"Green goat pizza is out of this world. Excellent spot for casual dining.  Great beer selection. Very friendly staff.  Taking my son and his fianc√© when they come to town."}
{"text":"This place has come a long way since it first opened. The atmosphere is casual and dark and friendly. The food is interesting, flavorful and thoughtful.. You can tell that people who own Sardine take the same type of care with the menu here. I would call this casually sophisticated- even the wines by the glass seem to be carefully chosen and also well-priced. I also appreciate how late they are open. They cater to a very diverse crowd- from families in the early part of the evening, to older people later on and everyone in between. I've tried a number of dishes here, including the portobella sandwich and most recently, the clam pie. It's all fresh and well executed. The surprise here is how great the pizza is! And also, the homemade desserts are incredible. Apparently, they change often, so the servers just recite them rather than hand you a list.  My one suggestion is that they cut back a little on the nuts and raisins in the carrot cake. Other than that, keep doing what you are doing! Madison is lucky to have this place."}
{"text":"Nice place, has a New England fishing shack decor I think.  Very limited menu with maybe a half dozen sandwiches and burgers.  The appetizers are very good with the sandwiches getting just a good mark.  The kids really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere, definitely a neighborhood family-oriented restaurant- it is always very loud and hectic in here.  I have eaten at Gates and Brovi about 5-6 times now, and never been particularly impressed with anything beyond apps and burgers. I like their wines by the glass, and it's an okay happy hour option, but the entrees I've tried tend to be bland and not very filling for the price. Plus the service is pretty hit or miss. I haven't had their pizza (gluten sensitivity) but my friends like the pizza there better than the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try G&B since I love it's sister restaurant, Sardine, so much. Unfortunately, it fell a little short of expectations. The drinks list was pretty good (some nice creative cocktails), while the food was okay. The decor is a bit of a miss- better than many places in the city but feels lost between a sports bar, a bistro, and a New England crab shack."}
{"text":"Given the restaurant's pedigree (Sardine and Marigold), I was really excited to check out Gates & Brovi. There's a distinct neighborhood bar feel and the interior is pretty neat. A big bar, lots of reclaimed wood and some exposed brick.  When there's a wait - and there is sure to be one - the waitress writes your name and something to identify you on a big chalkboard so you can see when you'll get seated.   We ordered some shrimp fritters, the Parman patty melt, the G&B, and a half dozen oysters. To my surprise, most of the food is served in baskets and burgers just come with a side of coleslaw (small, but tasty). Oysters were fresh and tasty, but I was hoping for some mignonette not cocktail sauce. The shrimp fritters where a-OK, the remoulade definitely helped thingsout in the flavor department. The burgers are griddled and made from a single patty. I chose the Parman patty melt: fried onions, braunschweiger, sauerkraut, mustard and special sauce. It was definitely a flavorful burger, but nothing stood out for me.  Same goes for my dining companion. The tap beers aren't that exciting, but there's a nice variety.   While there was nothing bad about my experience, nothing really stood out. Like many others, I had really high expectations but left wanting more. Will I go back? Yep, but I'm in no rush to do so. I'd be interested in going back on a Wednesday or Friday to tryout their specials."}
{"text":"This place is fine, but I think if I ever go again it will be because it is the only thing in its area that has late-night food. Otherwise, I don't think it's anything special for regular lunch or dinner hours. It's not bad, but I don't think it knows what it wants to be. Food is good enough: hot beef sandwich, vegetarian burger, calamari, fries. Everything was fine, just not really \"special.\" The best thing was the small side of coleslaw, in my opinion. There are many other more exciting restaurants in Madison. That said, the prices were reasonable, and the place isn't pretentious."}
{"text":"We stopped here sort of on a whim after riding by on our bikes one evening. We stopped hoping for good food and good beer, and to our delight, we were not disappointed. The draft beer list was relatively long and the food we ordered was tasty. I had the Italian artichokes, radicchio, kalamata olives salad and he had the shrimp po' boy. The salad was super flavorful and the po' boy didn't disappoint with the amount of shrimp that was stuffed between to pieces of toasty baguette. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We love this place. G&B has a really great vibe and pleasant atmosphere on Monroe Street. Our food has been uniformly excellent, though some may balk at the unusual menu. Service is cheerful and prompt.  Parking can a challenge, but if it's too inconvenient, you can always go to the mall. A short walk won't kill you."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night and it was packed with families at 6 PM.  We were luckily able to nab a spot at the bar and not have to wait 20 minutes for a table.  The bartenders were busy, but we never had to wait unnecessarily long for service.  They have a very large beer selection and a well-stocked bar.  They had about 6 signature drinks.  I didn't get one, but I saw the mint vodka lemonade being made and it looked good!  They used fresh mint and muddled it.   The menu was a little limited.  Lots of seafood options, so I don't recommend it if you aren't a fan of seafood, but if you are, it's a great place for you!  I got the Friday fish fry and had the option of cod or blue gill.  I chose the cod and it was pretty standard fish fry-nothing too special.  It was good and I enjoyed it, but it wasn't great.  I did like that they offered malt vinegar for the fish and fries and they served it with Ranch without me having to ask.  The coleslaw was good but a bit too acidic.  My fiancee got the G&B Burger and enjoyed it.  He especially liked the special sauce.  However, I was disappointed that it didn't come with any fries or other sides for the price that it was. I liked the decor and atmosphere.  It made me think of a New England pub with the emphasis on seafood and beer.   Overall, it was a good dinner and I can't complain about much, but I don't know if I'd go back.  It seems like a great place for families with kids because of the pizza options.  The prices seemed fair as well."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere; was quite busy but the service and the waittimes were perfectly acceptable.  Everyone in my group had something different and was quite happy.  A great addition to the Madison restaurant scene."}
{"text":"The space is fun and industrial. My salmon burger was delish! The beer selection is great. But a few things bugged me about G&B -- I felt like they were nickel-and-diming us, instead of treating us like guests.  First, the description of the specials that the server gave us had no prices mentioned, and were not listed in writing anywhere. Well, this is awkward, to make me ask.   Second, the sandwiches come with just a pickle and a thimble of mediocre coleslaw. This fact is not listed on the menu, either. It is left to the guest to figure out. Even though our sandwiches were $13 and $14,  we decided to be big spenders and buy a plate of fries to split, with a side of mayo with extra-yummy dipping - because I'm a sophisticated lady.    When the check came, they had charged us for the side of mayo. Fifty cents. Who's idea was it to charge for mayo? Was it yours, Gates? Or was it you, Brovi? For some reason, I just found this detail quite irritating. No one has charged me for mayo in more than a decade. And, if you are going to charge for run-of-the-mill condiments, then give me the heads up so I can laugh about how ridiculous that policy is with my dinner mate WHILE I enjoy my fries.   So, in short, good food surrounded by lots of TVs. There's a a lot of places like that in Madison, so I won't be running back, since they got under my skin. If someone in my life does want to go again, I will just plan to BYOM. (Bring your own mayo.)"}
{"text":"I travel to Madison frequently, and discovered Gates & Brovi. Through Yelp. I've been here several times in the last couple months, and it does not disappoint! The staff is friendly and welcoming, the decor is a very cool Northwoods camp style and the food is well above average! Nice selection of crafts on draft, and the dinner specials have been indeed special. A casual atmosphere does not betray an attention to detail in all areas of the operation. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food and cold beer (great selection) in a cozy atmosphere. The waitstaff is super friendly as well....this is our \"go to\" spot for watching sports as well. Great neighborhood location!"}
{"text":"As first timers we worried that it would be one of those neighborhood joints where kids were running wild.  We were pleasantly surprised to find the tables occupied by adults in conversation.  We were greeted promptly and our order was taken right away.  We did order wine which was served in cocktail glasses (guess they don't do much wine business).  Our food came promptly and it was very good.  Our overall experience was very good, with prompt and pleasant service and food that was pleasing to the eye as well as the palate.  We would come again."}
{"text":"Very glad I gave them a second chance.  My first visit was a few months after their opening date and was unimpressed beyond the atmosphere which reminded me of an East Coast fish house.  While I'm all for limited menus as long as what's offered are great choices, it was impossible for us to find anything we were even remotely interested in trying... and what we opted for tasted no better than your standard chain seafood restaurant.  I actually groaned when my friend suggested we meet for dinner & drinks on Tues. but was assured they had worked out their glitches & revamped the menu.  Very pleasantly surprised with the changes!  Finally it was hard for me to make a decision not due to nothing standing out but because I was torn between multiple items!  We started with calamari which had a panko type breading & no greasiness.  Moved on to the beet & avocado salad, a mix of wonderful summer flavors & large enough to share.  My friend ordered the cod cakes which I sampled and melted in your mouth.  Since I've been missing the South, I was drawn in by the Bluegill BLT with pimiento cheese.  GREAT sandwich and the addition of pimiento upped the flavor as well as held it together without being a huge mess.  Add a really good server to the mix & I can happily say I will be back.... and no groaning involved beyond that of a satisfied, full stomach."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood place very popular with families but also with an active bar in the evening. The decor is basic. The waitstaff are welcoming and friendly. Most important: the food is simple but excellent. Kids are welcomed."}
{"text":"People! Why hasn't anyone pointed me to this place with a tad more enthusiasm? Between personal recommendations and the overall yelp review, I hadn't given it a second thought until today. Our family is on a mission to find a decent Friday fish fry that is relatively accessible to the west side, and that's how we ended up here. I will admit, my expectations were low. And then they blew my socks off.... Tara, our server, was outstanding. Thank you for your obvious appreciation of food and sustainability and preparation. Thank you for answering my 9 year old's query about the soup of the day with a mouth watering description written for, well, anyone else but a 9 year old...because she appreciated it and I appreciated you treating her that way.  I came for the fish fry and ended up not being able to resist the fish special - grilled amberjack with a pearled pasta, saut√©ed local asparagus and grilled ramp with a Chile lemon salsa (more of a sauce). Holy. Cow. I would like another. Perfectly prepared in every way and I'll be thinking of this fish for a long time to come. I snagged a bite of my mom's bluegill fish fry (Canadian Great Lakes caught) and it was wonderfully done as well. Light breading, bluegill yumminess...would have liked to see something a bit more original with slaw or veg choices but fries, baby reds, green beans, and broccoli are your choices. They also set the fish down onto the broccoli which caused the broccoli to take on the fish taste which was a bit of a turn off.  My little food aficionado likes to order something she has never tried, and tonight's choice was clam chowder. Full of carrots, celery, potato, and clams and NOT the same boring white color I attribute to clam chowders, this went over quite well.  \"One of the best burgers I've had in a while\" is from my husband - that doesn't happen often, so take that for what it's worth (a lot, the man prizes a good burger). We had no room, or we would have ordered any of the several pies that passed our table for dessert.  I will be back, and I do look forward to it. Please G&B, consider that fish special as a rotating menu item!"}
{"text":"I have been to Gates and Brovi twice. I did not write a review the first visit because I wasn't particularly impressed. I do not want to give an unfavorable review after only one visit. Truthfully, I cannot even recall what I ate. I just remember that no one at the table was thrilled with their food. We walked away full but the food was totally forgettable. The first visit was at night, the place was bustling. We had good service despite the crowd.  A few days ago I visited Gates and Brovi at lunch time. It was a business meeting of sorts but my friend and I agreed that we would not bring our paperwork into the restaurant as not to \"hog\" a table during the busy lunch hour. It turned out we had nothing to worry about. We were at the restaurant for a couple of hours and there were many tables available during our stay.  I had the shrimp salad sandwich and my friend had the eggplant sandwich. I thought the dressing on the shrimp was extremely thin and tasteless. The shrimp were small and probably had been frozen. The bread became soggy and there was  a sad little lettuce leaf for some desperately needed crunch. I ate the sandwich with a fork.  The eggplant sandwich looked very appealing. It was a pretty plate of food. However, my friend stated that the sandwich was terribly under-spiced and just bland in general.   So, I do not plan to return until I hear that changes have been made. The menu is very small and not many of the items drew my attention. I cannot believe that the restaurant is run by the same folks who own Sardine and Marigold. Both restaurants have consistently excellent food and a great vibe to go with it. I still hold out hope for Gates and Brovi for the future. ( I wish they would change the name)."}
{"text":"Really use to like this place,  but now it seems like they are cutting back on portions and quality. I had an OK burger and the wife had the fried chicken sandwich. The fried chicken part was good,  but the sauce was to over powering.  It ruin the whole sandwich. The half pickles that come with each sandwich.Were a total of 3 slices.Come on if your going to charge me 12-14 a sandwich. And not even including fries. Can I get a half pickle not just 3 slices. The fries were not good also. Limp, greasy and cold. Our go to fried smelt was a very small portion. They use to come in a basket now just a small handful on a plate. Don't waste your money.  Over all really really disappointed with the food. For the prices  you charge.  You should be ashamed at the portions and quality of your food."}
{"text":"We went here on St. Patty's Day and the place was bumping! There was a live band, the bar was packed but service was still expedient and friendly, and cocktails were delicious. When we were seated (they have some nice long benches that work great for kids and large parties), we ordered an assortment of food - all of which did not disappoint. Great stop, and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"On our first attempt to go there for dinner the place was packed on a Saturday night.  On our second attempt we arrived shortly after the kitchen closed for the night.  On our third attempt we got in right as dinner started to be served on a Wednesday night.  It wasn't packed but business picked up over the hour we were there.  The waitress didn't quite have her banter.  The only adjective she used to describe menu items was \"interesting\".  The 1/2 order of oysters for appetizer were decent.  Fried chicken is the Wednesday night special.  The serving was large, consisting of 4 oddly chopped sections of bird.  The breading was heavy and tasted slightly overcooked.  The boiled potatoes were good.   The brandy old fashion was great.  But there is no happy hour so we both had one and called it a dinner."}
{"text":"I love the urban vibe of this place: the high ceilings, the casual picnic style tables perfect for families or large gatherings, the cozy tables for two, and the attentive, friendly service. In fact as of late this corner bistro/bar has become my favorite neighborhood hang-out. One suggestion would be for the waitstaff to become a bit more knowledgeable about the origins of their beef. Although our waiter knew the beef came from a farm in Iowa, he knew little else other than the fact it's not organic-certified (wah, wah). In opting for the vegetarian burger, however, I must say it was the BEST veggie burger -bar none- that I have ever tasted! And I repeated this experiment on three other occasions to ensure it wasn't a fluke. The first time I tasted the veggie burger the waiter tore off the label from the box so I could check it out. The ingredients label indicated it contained 100% vegan & organic ingredients. I am not a vegetarian, and I have a hard time believing there can be anything low-fat about a veggie burger this good, but if you're looking to branch out from beef (not really meant for human consumption), you'd be hard-pressed to find one that made you miss the taste of beef any less than this one!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant and tried a gluten free crust pizza and the bluegill BLT.  Both items were very good.  Beer was cold and yummy.  Our waitress was extremely helpful and patient with all our questions (husband is gluten and milk free, so eating out is a little complicated.)  Even though I was stuffed, I brought home a piece of plum ginger pie and had it for dinner.  It sounded a little weird, but turns out plums with a little ginger surrounded by a pretty good crust is a great combination.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome cheese curds! Really solid comfort foods. Salmon burger and fried chicken sandwich were delicious. Unique flavor combinations. Will go again."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I was in town visiting family and per my cousin, this place was amazing, and we had to go here while I was in Madison. Conveniently it is located maybe a minute away from their house.  The atmosphere here is so homey, yet cool and modern. We ended up getting seated right away, and got a table along the back. Our waiter was fantastic, and very knowledgeable about the menu, and had made a few suggestions.  I ended up getting a Fried Cod Sandwich, a beer, and a shared appetizer of Cheese Curds (Because I definitely missed them since I can find them NO WHERE in Michigan.) The Sandwich was fantastic, the Cod was cooked to perfection and very yummy.   Can't wait to come back out to Madison and try it again!"}
{"text":"Our group got there just after 9 on a Friday night and the place was still full of people eating - always a good sign. There was still a free table and so were seated right away. The server was prompt, friendly, and efficient - knowing when to engage us, check in to see how we were doing, but otherwise letting us enjoy our meal. The round of signature drinks was again stellar - the hot trollope is a curiously tasty drink that is my new starter drink - the pleasant jalape√±o sear won't be for everyone but it works for me. For the main course, I tried the fried bluegill and it was perfect. The breading seemed wonderfully crunchy, crumbly, nicely seasoned, and generally very much homemade. The tartar sauce also blew me away. Wow. Tasted very homemade with what appeared to be coarsely chopped tender home pickled cucumber slices vs the usual chunks of tough-skinned canned pickles. The sauce seemed much less mayo based, possibly with some buttermilk to thin the consistency away from the mayo paste other places do, but this is a great thing - the greasy finish of mayo just doesn't need to be paired with fried fish - the GnB sauce has a much cleaner finish that really shines and accompanies the fish. The side of coleslaw and red potatoes with the fish were completely fine. My companion thought the potatoes were only just lukewarm but I didn't really notice or mind. They seemed cooked perfectly, served buttered and parsley'd, though they could have maybe used a bit of something - maybe a more pronounced garlic note, a splash of freshly ground black pepper, or maybe a small shave of fresh parmesan. The coleslaw comfortably rides the line between a creamier style and a purely vinegar based slaw - works for me. All-in-all, a near perfect meal!"}
{"text":"I came here for a double date on a Saturday night. Reading the reviews on Yelp, I had my bar set a little lower than usual. However, I was pleasantly surprised!  We has the veggie fritters and oysters for apps. The fitters were basically lightly fried, tempura(ish) style veggies. They were tasty combined with the sauce it was served with. The oysters tasted fresh and were served with the usual Tabasco, crackers and horseradish.   For dinner, I had the Fisherman's stew with was a combo of seafood (oysters, clam, fish, crab, mussels) in a spicy tomato broth. It was served with a side of French bread. I really enjoyed the stew. I highly recommend it. My wife had the seafood penne pasta. It was also very tasty and well prepared.   Presentation and portions were right on. We also had homemade cherry pie ala mode. It was delicious!  Overall, decor and environment was very nice. The food was tasty. It was very pricey so be prepared to spend a lot if you go with a three course meal. Do not go here on a game day or night unless you want to actually watch the game. It gets very loud!"}
{"text":"Great dining room! Really nice decor and they have TV's. This makes me happy because there are very few places in the neighborhood to watch those annoying big games that are aired on cable channels.  We went the first week they were open so I can't be too critical. Service was good, but they had a TON of staff on. The first three things we tried to order off the menu they were sold out of. Kind of annoying but as I said I do realize they just opened. I had the burger, which was good, not great, but good. A little undercooked for the medium well I ordered. Why do restaurants put burgers and sandwiches on menu's with out a side? I never get this. We ordered a side of fries to accommodate my side craving, but for an $8.00 burger I would expect more than just a side of coleslaw. My wife had the chicken sandwich also good, not great. Our fries also came out cold. The shrimp fritter appetizer was delicious though.  The inside of this place is absolutely beautiful, great job by the architect. I will give this place another shot in a month or two after they work out the opening kinks, but after eating there the first time I'm not craving anything that would bring me back sooner."}
{"text":"Our supper club went to Gates and Brovi the other night and I was very pleased. We arrived early as we wanted to be there in time for the Oyster Happy Hour. Between the six of us, we ordered three dozen oysters. Served on the half shell, they did a pretty darn good job of shucking the oysters. With only a few exceptions, the oyster meat was separated from the shell, still had its sweet juice, and was nearly grit free. It was definitely worth the effort to get there early for these.  For appetizers we had the Fried Smelt and the Baked Goat Cheese with Eggplant Caponata. I'm not a big fan of goat cheese nor eggplant so that appetizer was not to my liking but the rest of our group thought it was delicious. I was a big fan of the smelt. Even folks in our group who aren't big fish fans thought the fried smelt was tasty.  For entrees, our group all chose the Fishermans' Stew, a burger, or the orrechiette. Everyone gave their meal a positive review. I thought the stew was a little too tomato juice like and could have benefited from a little more seasoning but I was pleased w/the overall flavor and the amount of seafood.  Our waitress throughout the evening was prompt and friendly. She was great about refilling beverages.  We parked on side streets about one block away. I did see a parking enforcement officer ticketing cars on the opposite side of the street, so do watch out for that.  All in all, we really enjoyed Gates & Brovi. I definitely intend to go back for the Oyster Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"This place is great. $1.25 oysters, great pizza, great service and a beautiful spot. Very unique!"}
{"text":"Nice feel, easy atmosphere. Lunch menu a little limited, but food was great.  Got to avoid the evil high fructose corn syrup with WiscoPop (black ) yummy.  Big servings, good service, and just a nice relaxing Sunday lunch (while out catching Pokemon off the lake.)"}
{"text":"An outstanding place for fun, unusual, and delicious breakfast choices! The service was impeccable, and the Bloody Marys topped it off perfectly!"}
{"text":"Simplicity at its best. G&B offers a nice touch of good ol' bar food in a clean, warm, and inviting feel atmosphere. Nice bar with plenty of TVs to catch any of the games on. Nice selection of beer as well. I'm a out of towner and my cousin brought me here for their awesome cheese curds and they did not disappoint. Extremely light but well seasoned batter encasing bite sized little curds of heaven with their home made dipping sauce was well executed. The fried smelt was a pleasant treat. Again with the light batter but full of flavor with moist tender meat on the inside, paired with their homemade tartar sauce, it was one of my favorite things I ate on my trip. Their burger was simple yet bursting with tons of flavors that elevated the humble american staple.  The service was good and I'd say it was a pleasant experience dining here. Simple food done right with subtle changes that elevate it is what makes any restaurant stand out. G&B do just that and do not disappoint.   Stay fat mother suckers"}
{"text":"A regular destination for us. Their fried calamari is some of the best we've had. Their fried artichokes, onions, and lemons are an item I would love for them to bring back. Green goat pizza is another favorite. Don't miss the Tom and Jerry drink around Christmas time."}
{"text":"Some of my favorite curds in town. Great fish fry. Great pizza. Everything they do is fantastic."}
{"text":"Don't miss the smelt or clam pizza. Great cocktails, oysters and a clean, casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Gates and Brovi is a solid choice for dining in the Dudgeon-Monroe neighborhood. Service, vibe and space is easily a 4 star experience. The vibe is cozy and warm and the large space is great for groups or families. However, I have to give Gates a 3 based on food...I've had good things there, but I've had a lot of mediocre things there. I'd probably end up giving it a 4 star, but food is mediocre and prices are high...double whammy.  Good:  Bluegill fish fry with roasted red potatoes Cheese Curds (actually amazing!) Crab dip--mmmmm...so good  Not so good: Clam/Fennel Pizza--maybe I should have known better, but this was really not my thing. Shrimp Fritters--NOT worth the price. Not that great, and expensive. Parmesan/Garlic Chicken Wings--really not Gates' wheelhouse, these wings were pretty bad, lukewarm and a little soggy Beet salad--good flavor, but too heavy on carrots Shrimp Salad sandwich--just not that good, too sweet, and the avocado was not a good texture with shrimp  Overall...I will keep going to Gates' for the bar and atmosphere, but I hope they refine a few things and keep prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Gates and Brovi.  They now have these gorgeous pies on the menu.  I had sumptuous pecan pie with a dollop of maple whipped cream on the top.  My comrade had the apple caramel pie, which was a generous slice with gooey caramel across the plate.  In addition to the great black bean soup, lunch was perfect.  But it's the pie that will make Gates & Brovi a destination stop for me."}
{"text":"Just tried breakfast at Gates & Brovi and liked the neighborhood vibe and restaurant ambiance. Service was very good but from there it was downhill. The coffee was good but only served lukewarm - how about serving it piping hot to begin with??? We ordered the Mushroom Scramble and the Blueberry Pancakes. The Scramble was runny, had too much cream cheese, and was flavorless. The Blueberry Pancakes were OK but the blueberries were minimal and lacking in taste. Also, the plates/food/syrup were all cold which is a pet peeve with me - I want my meal to be served HOT - show me you care. The potatoes served with the Scramble are much better than those served at their sister restaurant - Marigold Kitchen - but overall Marigold or Original Pancake House are better choices for breakfast."}
{"text":"Some positives: - they made a good brandy old fashioned - oysters were decent - boiled potatoes were really tasty - a great space  Some thing to improve on: - the fried chicken breading was too heavy and doughy. - a very random feeling menu, expected more seafood options. None of the burgers sounded appealing. Braunschweiger? Really? - no drink specials"}
{"text":"Pretty good. The service was quick and the food was delicious. The cheese kurds were very flavorful!"}
{"text":"Boy, was I disappointed...  We were hoping for a nice little pub we could walk to from our house and what we got was Sysco food, overpriced hamburgers and a really nice waiter who did her best in a pretty bad situation.  The menu is small, and somewhat schizoid...lobster?   Nice decor...but that's it.  I'll keep walking right past it to the Laurel Tavern. Better food for less.  Too bad...this end of Monroe needs a restaurant."}
{"text":"The pizzas have a great, crispy crust. I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere. The black bean soup of the day was also delicious. The pizza could feed 2-3 people easily, too, so the price is worth it to me."}
{"text":"I have to put an asterisk next to this four stars.  The linguine was too salty for my taste but if you get a meal of just beer, cheese curds, and pie you're set. If you are thinking I can't just have a dinner of beer, cheese curds and pie; I think you're in the wrong state."}
{"text":"My family and I stumbled on to Gates & Brovi by accident, and we were so pleased that we did!   Decor: Although I am not totally certain as to what the designers of this restaurant were looking for, it is clear that whoever did it is in love with textures and wood tones. The effect is homey, calming, and welcoming. Combined with the beautiful windows and the winter sky, and it was really quite beautiful sitting there. Perhaps the only thing that could be said to mar the experience is the tendency of the designers to push the hipster sensibility a little too far (see the Carling's Black label sign over the bar, or perhaps the red plastic food baskets) past a celebration of kitsch into the patronizing zone. This is Madison, however, and if you cannot handle the occasional smug hipsterism, you will be happier moving elsewhere.   Food: Unlike some of the other reviewers, our experience with the food was overwhelmingly positive. Our experience was that the chowder was stellar (A-), the burgers very, very good (B+), as was the pulled pork (B+), and the sliced roast beef sandwich (B+), the french fries were very fine--but not as good as at Sardine (B), and the hot ham sandwich was also better than competent (B). The boiled shrimp--in shell--was fine, but not remarkable (B-), largely due to indifferent spicing and shrimp quality. We did not try the signature lobster. Overall, this is MUCH better than most of the food to be found in Madison restaurants.  Service: The service was highly efficient, in good humor, and took on serving our large table with grace. The service is informal, but that is the point of this place.    Alcohol: We were not drinking because it was midday. The beer offerings looked competent, but I didn't make a systematic study of the listings.  Recommendation: I'd encourage the folks at G&B to think about ways to convince Madisonians that they are getting real value for their gastro-pub fare. This might be either (a) making the food so good that we are amazed that it is being served in plastic baskets and with disposable napkins, or (b) improving the presentation.  I'd hate for this place to fold because it doesn't make customers valued.  And it might be good to pull down the Black label sign if your customers aren't going to drink Black label.  Gotta keep your credibility."}
{"text":"Just left a very delicious dinner at Gates & Brovi!   Hubby had the G&B burger and I had the Salmon Burger at the recommendation of the waitress (was also considering the Bluegill BLT). Hubs liked his burger, although it was a bit messy. I REALLY liked the Salmon Burger. It comes topped with a slaw, cucumber slices and spicy aioli that were the perfect complement. There's also a slaw served on the side that is on the vinegar, rather than mayo, side of the flavor wheel. The level of vinegar was pretty much perfect for my tastes. Hubs and I also split a small basket of fries, which was plenty for the two of us. The fries were thin cut - just like I like them! - and a tad overcooked. But hey, I'd rather have an overcooked fry rather than an undercooked one. Portion sizes were good and we both had half of our burgers left over to take home.   We ended out our meal with their dessert of the day - a simple almond cake with hand whipped cream. The cake was lightly dusted with powdered sugar and was absolutely delicious! Needless to say, there was no cake left over to take home.  The space is open and airy, although our table in the bar was a little overwhelmed with patrons waiting in the bar area for tables to open up. It's also a little noisy with the bar flowing right into the main dining area. There is a smaller, snuggly room at the rear of the main dining area, so I imagine if you can finagle your way into that room, you'll experience significantly less noise.  For a busy Saturday night, our wait was fairly short (20 mins), and absolutely every member of the staff was hustling to serve the patrons in an efficient but unhurried manner.   We'll definitely be back for the excellent food and service!"}
{"text":"Key word: bland.  Fish fry: bland. Fried artichokes: bland. Potatoes: bland. Soup: surprisingly, way too salty.  But hey, it cost practically nothing. I think the flaccid pile of fish I ate was about $9.   This would have been a one-star review, but an entire star was salvaged by the incredible service provided by our waitress. She noticed that we weren't having a good time and surprised us with a free piece of pie! Gold star!  Anyway, bleh."}
{"text":"Checked out Gates & Brovi last week for dinner. It had a good crowd for a Tuesday, but we were able to sit right away. Nice atmosphere, casual but trendy. A lot of wood and brick and a nice welcoming feeling. We were greeted at the door and directed to a booth. As a big guy - I was happy to see that I fit in their booth and the table moved as well. Sounds dumb, but nothing turns you off faster than not being comfortable where you are sitting.  A nice collection of tap beers - we tried a couple which were both good. Our waitress was very nice and filled us in on the specials. The descriptions were a bit long winded, but we are sort of foodies so I didn't mind too much - but it could have used some editing.   We first tried the Shrimp Fritters - AMAZING! If the owners of this place read this - don't change a thing with this appetizer. It was the perfect size (I think we got about 8 fritters), the taste was excellent - perfect shrimp to breading, not too greasy and very well seasoned. Even the sauce that came with it was great! This is a lock-down excellent menu item.  Next we had two items from the Sandwiches - I had a fried cod sandwich and my wife had the grilled portobello sandwich. Both were quite good. The portobello had great flavor and was very good. The fish sandwich ended up a bit messy - not sure why but about halfway thru the bottom bun was done for. This is probably because the fish was cooked well and was still juicy and yummy. Very good. We also tried a side of saut√©ed green beans. They were a touch under cooked for my taste - but fresh.   Overall we were pleased - good service, decent beer tap selection and very yummy food. We will definitely return to try other items."}
{"text":"We rented out the arbor house for a family reunion which is right around the corner and fell in love with this restaurant. The bar tenders know how to make a drink and after trying almost the whole menu, we never found something we didn't like."}
{"text":"Great place to take the family. Waitstaff is always pleasant. Had the Friday night bluegill special with baby reds. Top notch. Definitely a family favorite."}
{"text":"Fantastic Fish Fry. Went back a few times to enjoy the fish fry. One of the best on the West side of Madison in my opinion."}
{"text":"A nice meal and a nice evening out.  Ventured over to the westside for dinner.  Thought it may be crowded due to the all city swim meet at Nakoma, but we got right in and found a comfortable booth.  I enjoyed a variety of their taps.  Summer, so a weissbier and of course an IPA. For dinner, i kept my burger streak going and had the mushroom, gorgonzola cheese burger.  Messy and delicious.  I didn't read the menu very closely and was surprised when not asked about fries, chips etc.  So, was very surprised to not get any. She had the chicken picatta, and loved it!! The lemon caper garlic sauce on top of the breaded chicken was oohed on.  The potatos completed a delicious serving.  We finished, thought about dessert, and so went with the cheese curds.  They were pretty good.  Lightly battered and even better without the sauce.  We'd visit again."}
{"text":"Gates & Brovi is so close to my new place that it may become a problem. I've only been here twice, but I think about it far too often.  During my last visit here I ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich and it was amazing! I got it sans the pepperoncini, so I can't speak to it's true form, but it was wonderful the way I ordered it. Nicely fried white meat on perfectly toasted bread, with fresh tomato, lettuce, mayo, and a delectable basil pesto. I could order this again and again and again. I found the coleslaw it came with bland, but the sandwich is large enough that you don't really need a side to fill you up.  When speaking of substitutions, they are extremely accommodating to changes in their dishes to fit you better (minus their specialty pizzas.. you can't touch those). My sister wasn't too keen on the veggies in their penne pasta and they allowed her to add an assortment of other veggies she wanted. I found that really sweet. My boyfriend ended up ordering the penne pasta how it's originally served and it's perfect the way it is.  They also have great homemade cheese curds, which one dining mate declared their favorite in Madison. Quite an achievement, really.  On top of some wonderful food, the service is really great! I haven't been waited on so well in a long time. You can tell that they really aim to please their customers."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  We went after a Badger game and it was warm and inviting.  We ended up splitting the pork sandwich and fries and we were impressed.  Even though they don't have a drink menu, they will make you whatever drink you want.  Just ask for it.  I loved the \"up north\" feel but with the great food.  We'll be going back."}
{"text":"Great Friday fish fry. Great slaw. Good salmon burger. Very appetizing flatbreads. In short I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Run, don't walk, to Gates & Brovi!  Hyperbole, you say? Well, not really; it is kind of far away (on the far West end of Monroe St., near Odana) and thus if you just walk, it will likely take a long time.  But also because of the sheer awesomeness of the food. The talent behind Marigold and Sardine are at it again, and the food is wondrous.   Clam chowda? Amazing.  Turkey torpedo sandwich? Divine.  Pulled pork? May be the best in the city.  Haven't had dinner there yet but how can you go wrong with these guys running the show? Looking forward to trying out their fish fry as well as a number of other things on what looks like an excellent menu.  The decor and atmosphere is wonderful as well.   I just wish the place were neared to where I lived or worked. Oh well, guess I'll be running there again soon!"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Atmosphere more loud and noisy than we were anticipating.  Lots of children....which is fine... but the parents were not very interested in monitoring them."}
{"text":"I came here with people who are allergic to everything and Gates & Brovi was extremely accommodating and has a great gluten free / vegan menu. Parking is a little inconvenient, but the restaurant is pretty cute, kind of a coasty atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a few friends. We were there mostly to watch the Man U game but ended up eating too. The space is very cool-the type that makes you feel like you are a million miles away. They achieve that costal Atlantic feeling well. And major bonus points for having the EPL on most of the TVs :) we sat at the bar and had wonderful, friendly service by the bartender.   The brunch special was biscuits and gravy. I'm a total sucker for this dish and was a little worried when the bartender mentioned Italian sausage. The dish was not the typical southern sausage gravy but was excellent nonetheless. The biscuits were a bit denser than I normally prefer but still very good. It comes with eggs but I was allowed to substitute the white cheddar grits for no charge. My friend swapped the eggs for toast. It also comes with a huge \"side\" salad. The greens were very fresh and came dressed in a nice light vinaigrette which had a pleasant uniqueness to it.   The other dish ordered by our party was the shrimp cake benedict which also came with the same side salad. My friend thoroughly enjoyed it. Portions all around were large and could easily be split.   They have a short list of breakfast cocktails, all of which sounded delicious. I opted for the Salty Dog which was tempting given the fresh grapefruit juice promise. It did not disappoint.   Hooray hooray for brunch where all the paths meet!"}
{"text":"I like that four stars means \"Yay!  I'm a fan\" because that's exactly how I feel about this place.  It definitely isn't the best around Madison, but it isn't anywhere near the bottom either.  I've been hear multiple times and always enjoy the atmosphere, although on game days it can get really loud and crowded (but I suppose that's to be expected!).  The salmon burger is an excellent go-to there.  It's topped with some sort of delicious coleslaw and some other fantastic flavors.  My husband gets it every time.  Sometimes I wish their menu was larger which is a rare thought for me.  I don't know why I think that - maybe because I'm not always as excited about the options as I hope I'd be.  Regardless, I would recommend this place....just good luck parking."}
{"text":"We have been to Gates and Brovi a few times, both during the weekday for lunch and weekend dinners with friends.  It's a nice place with a very local friendly feel to it.  The prices are very reasonable.    I have to say the food is not particularly special.  The fried cheese curds are pretty tasty, but that's about as good as it gets.  The fries are thin and not particularly tasty, they don't give you very much, even a large order.  The panfried bluegill blt was alright, but really messy to eat and had too much sauce on it.  The G&B similar - strangely drippy.  Our dining companions seemed to like their food better, the linguine with sausage and clams and the soup of the day.  When I went for lunch, the place was practically empty and it was really cold.  I had brought a guest from out of town and she thought the place was charming and loved the homey Wisconsin feel, but didn't say much about the food.  We ordered dessert, which turned out to be a mistake for me as it was a stale piece of blueberry pie.    Parking is super difficult.  Even in the middle of the afternoon during a snowstorm.  That's not really their fault, but it does make it a challenge to eat there.    Go for the relaxed atmosphere, stay for the conversation and the beer, leave before they make you order any food."}
{"text":"We were invited here by some friends who said they have good oysters, they do. That unfortunately is where the good review ends. The meal itself was nothing to right home about. I had a shrimp Po'boy and it was just okay, I've had worse but I definitely have had better. The waitress seemed more concerned about getting us out of the place and the next guest into the seats than whether we were enjoying our evening there or not. I would return for the oysters and that's about it."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in this afternoon for a late lunch.  There weren't very many patrons so we choose a booth by the windows (which were in serious need of cleaning.)  Not having been here before we chose something \"safe.\"  Burger and fries.  One of the specials was a salmon pasta dish with a fried egg on top.  Really?  Pass.  The burgers arrived in reasonable time.  They were what some would call juicy.  We labeled them greasy.  Good flavor.  The fries (which were extra) were ok.  Not crispy, decent flavor.  So, two greasy burgers, fries extra.  No drinks, over thirty bucks.  Nah, we won't be returning here."}
{"text":"As a big fan of both Marigold Kitchen and Sardine, I was fairly excited to try Gates & Brovi. It has some hits and misses, but overall is a pleasant enough space to have dinner, and given the restaurant desert that is its location, a welcome addition to the area. As others have mentioned, the parking situation can be nightmarish, but if you arrive at 7 or later, you are officially allowed to park in the Mallatt's Pharmacy lot in back.  The decor is casual but clean and rustic, with lots of reclaimed barn wood. The tables and chairs are somewhat comfortable, though nothing to write home about. I do wish there was some aspect of the decor that absorbed sound, but there isn't, so it's fairly noisy. Also, if you want to watch the game while eating, you'll practically have to sit at the bar. The bathrooms are beautiful and clean, though. All waitstaff are quite nice and attentive, and those with long hair are careful to tie it back - always a plus in my book.  The first time I visited, I came for dinner with my boyfriend. We shared the cheese curds with homemade ranch as an appetizer. They were closer to The Old Fashioned's style than, say, Culver's - more free-form and greasy with less breading. They tend to clump together a lot, a mild annoyance. The homemade ranch was quite good, though. I ordered the brown sugar roasted pork sandwich (a la carte - the cheese curds were so filling). It was delicious but incredibly messy; I had to use a ton of napkins, the bread was soaked by the end of the meal, and I still had to excuse myself to wash my hands at the end of the meal. Not a problem for me, but if I were dressed well I might avoid it. My boyfriend ordered the G&B burger and a side of fries. I'm not sure why it comes with American cheese as the default - anyone who's tasted real cheese knows that American cheese tastes like the plastic in which it's wrapped. My boyfriend substituted cheddar, and it tasted fine, but not up there with the real burger champs in Madison (Dotty's and Blue Moon being high on my personal list). He was a little bummed that it didn't come with fries automatically, but given that the burger is only six bucks, it seemed fair to me. The fries were crisp and hot on arrival; they reminded me of the delicious fries at Sardine. The old-fashioned I had to drink was quite nice, just the right balance of booze and mixers.  The second time we visited, I just had a beer (Anchor Steam in a cold glass straight from the fridge), but my boyfriend was craving a root beer float. You'll have to order one of their \"ice cream sodas\" with root beer, but it's great. The ice cream is rich and tasty, and my boyfriend loved their choice of Stewart's for the root beer. They only pour half of the bottle into the glass, but they do give you the rest of it to refill at your leisure. Since he finished his \"ice cream soda\" before I finished my beer, the bartender courteously brought him some water without request, which I thought was a great touch. They were touting a new menu which starts today, so I will be returning to see how that is. I also look forward to trying their oyster happy hour someday, since I've liked Sardine's oyster happy hour so much."}
{"text":"Cool looking layout. Only had drinks this time.  Wait service was hit & miss.  Bartenders spot on great.  Busy place on a weekday - neighborhood crowd I suspect.  Parking a pain mostly.  Food looked good. Appetizer options not ideal for my taste buds."}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood spot.  Relaxed, friendly atmosphere.  Good beers and good food: we get the bluegill BLT and chicken picatta (great value) almost every visit.  Highly recommend for any type of occasion, family meals to drinks with friends and everything in between."}
{"text":"I like this place- the food is good.  The beer selection is good.  The bar is good.  Love the decor and layout.  But there is something about the menu that is off.  Its like they have a little bit of an identity crisis.  Are they seafood?  Creole?  American?  With pie??  Anyway, its one of the best cheeseburgers in all of Madison so I'm sticking with them."}
{"text":"It's not that I have a love/hate with this place.  It's more love/annoyed.  The food is reliably very very good.  It's pretty pricey, but not exorbitant.   They have a decent tap list, it's usually dominated by multiple different IPAs on a list of draft beers that's pretty small.  A bit more variety would be nice.   The real annoyance with G&B come from trying to park (which isn't their fault) and having no place to easily wait for a table when it's crowded - which it usually is.  If you get there early enough to find a table you'll struggle to find parking.  If you get there after the parking restrictions lift it will be too packed to find a table without without waiting while standing against the northeast windows dodging people trying to get to the bar."}
{"text":"Listen.   If you haven't had the pies at G&B you might as well just go jump into lake Wingra right now because your life is not worth living. Seriously, turn off the Duck Dynasty marathon and book it because your mind is about to explode into a million tiny pieces.   I'm inclined to just quit my job, sell my house, and sleep in the fucking arboretum so that I can wake up each morning to the smell of de-fucking-licious pies and just eat them all day long. I'm only keeping my job so that I have money to buy pies with.   My first time, I ordered the pecan pie. Pecan gooeyness and maple fucking whippy shit and I just put it all in my face and ordered two more."}
{"text":"This local joint (I live right up the street) is a welcome addition to the hood.  Craftsy beers and cocktails, fun supper-club twist apps (fried smelt!) and awesome pizzas make this a great option for a girls night out or a quirky first date.  The Pan Fried Bluegill BLT rocks - pimento cheese spread for god's sake!  Even the side of saut√©ed green beans were yummy.    I've done breakfast/brunch here a few times and it's equally decent - try the crabcake eggs benedict  and choose the side of grits - creamy, cheesy salty goodness!  I doubled down with a cup of coffee AND a mimosa - don't judge, it was a Sunday morning!  This place is family-friendly, which can sometimes feel distracting when you're downing an old fashioned on a Saturday night but it's informal, welcoming and neighborly."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Friendly staff. Beautiful bar. Clean. Nice decor family friendly casual but the food is unique. I enjoyed my food very much. I got clam chowder and prosciutto  pizza. I also recommend the ancho villa drink. Can't wait to come back and try more stuff!!!"}
{"text":"So I decided to give this place another shot (the thought of their cheese curds drew me in) I ordered the avocado, tomato, cucumber salad and it was amazing. I ate it right up. My boyfriend ordered the clam chowder...for something that is listed on there menu all the time we expected it to be amazing. It wasn't, it was runny and didn't have a lot of clams. Also the cheese curds were not as good as I remembered :( so disappointing. We may come back here if we are in a pinch but otherwise probably not. Average but not great."}
{"text":"First off, go early because parking is terrible.  I know they aren't totally in control of the parking but because of this I can't give a perfect review.  However, once you find a parking spot everything gets much, much better.  This is one of our go-to neighborhood spots for a casual dinner or even just cocktails.  Get the hot trollop cocktail...a margarita with jalapenos in it...totally great!  Nice, upper-class decor that's much better than the dark wood paneling of most supper clubs in Madison.  Gates & Brovi is a family favorite."}
{"text":"Always excellent. One of our favorite places even though we don't live in Neighborhood. All the food is good but any of the seafood/fish items r our favorites. Wish they would have the cod cakes on the menu more often, they r terrific. The oysters, calamari, and bluegill BLTs are awesome. Not what you'd expect from a \"burger bar\" type place."}
{"text":"This is one of the gems of the Monroe Street area. They're an East Coast style beach restaurant with a great menu and a well stocked bar. We walk down there for their seafood, Friday Night Fish Fry, their awesome pizzas, or even just to grab a drink at the bar.   They're always crazy busy in there, which tells you something about the place, and the staff has always been top notch for taking care of the weekend craziness. It quiets down after the dinner rush, and has been one of our favorite night cap stops after a big day out. They've also been great with dietary restrictions, vegetarians and gluten allergies."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are good, but not amazing.  Definitely a good place for a Friday night fish fry and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was our go-to spot while working in Madison.  I was on a location shoot and most of us are from the LA, CA area.  We can be very picky when it comes to food.  Everything was served well and tasted great!  Thanks for the good food Madison!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on weekday during Happy hour. Overall I had a good experience. Service was great and atmosphere was lively!   We ordered a dozen Oysters ($1.25 during HH), Fried Calamari, and the Pan Fried Bluegill BLT.  Oysters were below average, they were large but not plump and I felt some were even still a little frozen.   Calamari was good, I had no complaints other than to balance the types of Calamari (better ratio of the rings to the tentacles).  BLT was delicious from the buttered bread to the fish and other condiments. My only suggestion is to allow other side substitutes such as fries or chips, esp for the price."}
{"text":"Moving it up to four stars as they have revised the menu since my last visit.  With the menu now matching the interior (more emphasis on seafood, etc), our meals were a hit.  My girlfriend and I split the calamari appetizer and it was some of the best in town.  The calamari was extremely tender and the breading was well seasoned but not overpowering.  For our entrees, we order the G&B salad and the cod sandwich.  The salad was solid whereas the cod sammy was definitely the highlight.  Soft homemade bun, a big chunk of fried cod, lettuce, onion, (hold the tomato), and american cheese and tartar sauce.  The cod was fried perfectly and all the flavors blended together perfectly.  I won't be waiting another 10 months to visit again......."}
{"text":"This place was neat!  Wait staff was friendly and attentive.  We ordered cheese curds and the crab and spinach dip for appetizers.  Both were delicious. I had the special of the night for dinner which was some salmon burger and it was AMAZING!  That's salmon burger will get me going back there again and again."}
{"text":"This is one of three restaurants run by Phillip Hurley and John Gadau owners of Sardines and Marigold Kitchen. Opened in 2011 this is a friendly neighborhood place, warm and cozy. It is perfect for an evening when you do not want to cook but have a warm and delicious meal.  One of my favorite places to get a side of french fries. They are just sooo good. Last time I went with my family I ended up having the chicken picatta with lemon-caper garlic sauce, greens beans and crispy potatoes. It was the first time I had this dish and it was really good. It reminder me of my childhood. The portion are fairly large, especially their pizzas, so you can have leftovers.  Another dish to recommend is the orrechiette crimini & shiitake mushrooms, spinach, chili flake, pecorino romano, bread crumbs. I usually have them take off the chili flakes and add salmon or chicken on top.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating, especially if you have food allergies."}
{"text":"After being here three times I thought they were something very unique. Now after they took their only bone-in chicken dish off the menu (other than wings), I think they are just above average.   They have a nice decor, gastropub atmosphere, and they serve fresh oysters and mussels, but they are becoming more of an average Wisconsin bar. You know you are plummeting towards ordinary when umpteen reviews say you have the best cheese curds in town."}
{"text":"Forgot to check in and get my pictures.   Going back for more good food and great service. Wait....great food and good service.  Got to have the Shrimp Fritters.  I must try their oysters and garlic parm pork lion - I'm just in a no red meat mood but high seafood intake phase. I guess I'm missing home *sigh*   P.S. Sardine related (ddin't know this  until I read)  P.P.S. CLOSED ON MONDAYS~"}
{"text":"Highlights/lowlights  1) decent food 2) nice atmosphere 3) ok location   Visited Gates and Brovi for brunch on a Sunday. I had heard really mixed things but went in with an open mindset.  The location is on the far west side of Monroe Street, so not in a super central location but not an expensive uber from downtown. We arrived around 11:10amish and were told they were only serving brunch for 20 more minutes! Gahhh! The brunch menu is pretty solid, with a variety of savory entrees (scramblers) as well as pancakes. There is full service at the bar, and it wasn't busy at all so we ate there. The atmosphere is cute, hard to describe but probably best described as \"modern American\" or \"upscale family style\". You can definitely tell it's a newer spot.  We ordered scramblers with a side of cheesy grits. There isn't gluten free bread, but the servers/bartenders are knowledgeable about gluten free options. The food arrived fairly fast. It it was very mehhh. Not bad, but not super flavorful either. For what you pay it didn't seem worth it.   Overall, fun to try if you haven't ever stopped in, but probably not somewhere I will come back to over and over."}
{"text":"Pleasant, somewhat contrived decor. Pseudo-exposed wood and brick, etc.   We were a party of 10.  The service was terrible. Slow to take our orders, and the waitress didn't know details about the simple menu. And when she said \"I'll find out and let you know,\" she never did.   Finally, the food arrived -- cold. The waitress didn't have any idea who ordered what, which was confusing for everyone. Some things delivered, some taken back, some given to the wrong person. Two orders were missing.   The others ate while we waited for the missing meals. Finally, everyone was finished, and one missing order was delivered. The other never arrived. \"Don't worry,\" said the waitress, \"I removed the other hamburger from your bill.\" But upon inspection it wasn't, and we had to have that fixed.   Simply ridiculous. A disaster.  Even if it had arrived hot, the food was bland. The burgers, the calamari, the beet salad, the BLT, the three chicken tenders (for $8) -- all were unremarkable, yet very expensive. The selection of tap beer was poor too.   If you like superficially stylish overpriced restaurants, then you might like it. If you actually like good food, good drinks, reasonable service, and a fair price, then don't go."}
{"text":"My family and I have enjoyed coming here for some time, we always have a great experience. It's often a place we bring out of town guests. Casual, family atmosphere - there's a bar and some TVs so you can keep an eye on the Badgers or Packers. Good beer and wine list. Generally, great service - although it can slow down a bit when they get a little busy.   I forgot to take pictures again today - sorry. Family favorites of ours are the Bluegill BLT and the clam chowder. But today I got the mushroom and Gorgonzola burger, which was fantastic! Except for two things. The bun just fell apart all together, which is annoying. And, since I was never asked how I want the burger done, it came much more well done than I prefer. Usually, this would be a red flag, but everything else was so yummy, and I was so hungry...so I let it go.   Despite it not being a perfect burger, I'm sticking with 5 stars because I really like this restaurant and know they consistently offer really good food in a friendly atmosphere.   Sandwiches don't come with fries, but you're really, really going to want to order some as a side. Everything we ordered was wonderful, the G&B burger and the pizzettas too! And I mean it, get the fries - unless you get the cheese curds."}
{"text":"Gates & Brovi is a place to bring your kids or grandpa for a Friday night fish fry. The wooden am-in-the-galley-of-a-ship? interior is charming and the beach town checkered baskets of fried seafood might have you forgetting you're landlocked.  I went in to score what I had seen on Yelp is a great vegan burger. I asked our waiter and it turns out it has egg in it (bummski). I got a beet and avocado salad which was tasty but, at the end of the day... a salad when I wanted a burger. This is a place to get yo' fingers and shorts greasy (am I the only one who still wipes their hands on their lap? I told you this was a good place for kids) and wash it down with a pint of beer. The selection is limited but I had a great Lake Louie pale ale, so no complaints here. The service was quick and our waiter was friendly. Solid three stars in ma book."}
{"text":"The parking situation is terrible, but the pizza is great. Let me explain. Gates & Brovi is located next to that Mallatt's at the end of Monroe St, where it splits off into Nakoma Rd and Odana Rd. There is not private lot; it's all street parking. They have these very complicated diagrams everywhere showing you where you can and cannot park. Most of the suggested parking areas have some kind of restriction. Anyway, back to the pizza. They have 7 or 8 specialty pizzas on the back of the menu, and having tried about half of them, I can say they are all amazing. The crust is on the thin side, and I think they must have a wood-burning pizza oven in the back.   The Clam Pie has clams, roasted fennel, tomato sauce, cream, basil, mozzarella and parmesan and it all melts together in your mouth. The clams are very juicy *insert clam joke here* but the basil and fennel really make the flavors pop.   The Green Goat is also a good bet: basil pesto, zucchini, roasted tomatoes, oil-cured black olive, mozzarella and goat cheese. You can't go wrong with pesto and goat cheese.   Another one of my favorites is the Sausage and Roasted Artichokes pizza: parmesan b√©chamel, red onion, house-made giardinera and italian parsley. It combines many of my favorite things; giardinera, sausage, and artichokes. Win-win.  I also love the interior...it is really spacious, and the exposed brick walls, the cozy booths, and the wooden ceiling give it a casual but upscale feel. There are also a couple of big screens if you are into sports. I'll be back for more pizza...and their chowder looks good too!"}
{"text":"This restaurant confused me.  The coastal meets northwoods atmosphere was cozy and I would have perceived the restaurant to be fairly upscale, but the little details caused it to look pretty cheap.  Appetizers and sandwiches came in red plastic baskets and coleslaw came in leaky paper cups - I'd expect as much at a bbq joint, but not at a restaurant on Monroe Street.  French fries are an extra charge (I think $2); which is acceptable if they're good fries, and these were not (dry, crispy, overcooked, sad little fries).  There was a lack of sandwich/burger options on Monroe Street (still is IMO after eating here), but definitely not a shortage in Madison - better sammies and burgers can be had elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here with my three kids, it was fantastic! We had clam chowder, mussels, cod cakes, etc. Wonderful service and drinks too."}
{"text":"Cute local place. I have dreams about the green goat pizza! My boyfriend's cod cakes were also pretty good."}
{"text":"Noise level is really bad-- my head was ringing after 5 minutes from the noise bouncing off the wooden floor and ceiling, brick walls, and wooden tables.  Service was nice but food came out slooow (couple that came in after we had ordered was almost done with their food by the time ours arrived-- not good w/ two hungry kids at the table...)  Salads are overpriced for what you get... they're priced fine if they were something special, but they're not.  Menu is a bit all over the map, but centered on sandwiches.  My veggie burger was pretty good (not dry at all).  But overall with the horrible parking (none before 7:00), horrible noise, slow service, and with substantially better food elsewhere, I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"I love the food here! I will explain why i gave 4 of 5 - FOOD IS 5.  Love the local feel - even love that they have an awesome baker from State Fair who make the pies!  The fresh cut salmon burger is insane.  I'm totally obsessed.  Here's why i didn't give 5 stars.  I come here every time i'm in town for business and the male manager/beard has NEVER BEEN FRIENDLY, SAID HELLO OR EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED ME!  REALLY?  SMALL BUSINESS ?? probably needs to learn better guest etiquette!  The BEST ambassador of this place is TARA!  She recognizes me every time and makes me feel so welcome.  Her service is amazing.  Food and Tara is the reason i come back.  Owner - um... get a clue on friendliness!"}
{"text":"All Hail the place with the world's greatest cheese curds! These are an absolute must try! Stopped in with the girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers and loved it. The decor reminds me of a typical family diner. Very casual and very friendly. So, Did I mention the cheese curds? Yeah they are awesome! The place also serves up fresh oysters, fish fries, burgers, and more! Check it out!"}
{"text":"All I heard was 35 min wait.. hold up.. it's 545pm and already a 35 min wait? Okay then. Our friends raved about this place and he was meeting is there tonight... no turning back now.. you know what. IT'S WORTH EVERY MINUTE OF WAIT TIME.  We were seated and brought drinks.. the place was packed. An order of cheese curds and fresh.. damn fresh.. oysters landed on our table. Along with pasta and fish fry.. everything was amazing. Amy our server was sweet and attentive. Well for sure be back. Prices are perfect for quality of food and atmosphere is talkative, loud, and fun."}
{"text":"Had an excellent time here. Food was great and menu was imaginative and executed with ease. I was most impressed with the wine list. I was exceptionally happy to see a winery from my home state of Washington on the offerings (Seven Hills).  It was clear that they employ college students as servers and bussers. Many local businesses do, but Gates and Brovi got it right. The service from all was great. We were checked on by all and never felt ignored.   I will be bringing other people here; as it is a great way to showcase Madison restaurants!"}
{"text":"Favorite, most consistent, and most frequented restaurant in Madison. Friendly service, often shorter wait times than other restaurants on Monroe or on the square, great atmosphere with big windows and lots of light, and consistently good food with interesting specials. Favorite things on the menu: pizzas, cod cakes, burgers (both beef + salmon), and rotating soups. Only thing I don't love is the tempura veggie appetizer. Also, just a note that the salads are pretty small so I wouldn't order one as an entree if you're super hungry. ;) Breakfast is delicious too - though it ends at 11:30 since it's breakfast rather than brunch. Despite going to G&B a lot it never gets old! This is also our go-to spot when we have family and friends in town since there are options for all types of picky eaters. ;)"}
{"text":"We came to sit at the bar, lunch and watch college football. Love the atmosphere. Had the chicken sandwich with giardenera and it was awesome. Try the scotch ale on tap. If you like beers, you will live this one. Really nice scotch after taste."}
{"text":"I always was curious about trying out this restaurant and finally made it this past Friday night.  Upon arrival we were seated immediately.  The restaurant had a few big groups and overall was a little loud.  However that's to be expected on a busy Friday evening.  Overall the staff was very attentive, we received waters almost right upon sitting down.  Our server was friendly and ensured the pacing of dinner was perfect.  We had the calamari for an appetizer which was cooked perfectly although I think a little less breading would have been nice.  For dinner I ordered the chicken piccata which had a nice lemon caper sauce and the portion was huge!  Typically this dish is served with pasta but Gates and Brovi gave it a creative spin.  Their piccata is served with green beans and potatoes.  The green beans were cooked perfectly and the potatoes were very tasty as well.  The menu describes the potatoes as crispy but in truth the sauce soaks in and they weren't what I expected in terms of texture.  Overall I enjoyed the ambiance, service and food.  I highly recommend it and look forward to trying one of their pizzas next time.  Parking seems to be an issue other yelpers have brought up, however even on a busy Friday night we easily found street parking a block and a half away.  I also would point out that their space allows them to handle big groups so I could see if being a great choice for birthdays."}
{"text":"Definitely a food fight restaurant - you can always tell by how awkward the waiting service is. With these places you sometimes get 2 or 3 servers not ever knowing who is really taking care of you.   Our waitresses brought us an extra drink we didn't wanted and after we let her know she vanished for the rest of our meal and the manager started serving us....The manager said it was because they were busy but we only saw a few tables with people attending them. Why lie? Weird...  Otherwise the food was all so-so. I had the burger and the meat didn't taste fresh like how underground butcher usually prepares and tastes. They made a big rookie mistake of bringing plates of food before to our table before we were finished with the other stuff - something I can't personally stand.  Will not be back/ would not recommend. Maybe for a free meal, maybe"}
{"text":"I was not super impressed by this place. I had a couple of friends who raved about the place and wanted to meet here for drinks after work. They have an oyster happy hour from 3-6pm (T-F) and you can get raw oysters for $1.25/ea and $1 off beer. I had 6 oysters and a beer. The draft beer was cool and refreshing. The oysters were ok. I've had better oysters along the east and southern US coasts. These were not too meaty and were pretty tasteless. They come with sauce and crackers too. The ambience of the place is pretty casual and clean. The parking is a problem though. Without any formal dedicated parking lot, patrons are forced to cruise the neighborhood in circles to find a decent parking spot. The prices of the meals seemed a bit higher than comparable restaurants in Madison. I like that it's close to the bike path."}
{"text":"Went to check out G&B last Saturday night and stayed for the Badger game; Bucky lost to Alabama but I definitely won by choosing to dine and drink here !! Can't go wrong with the cheese curds or the shrimp fritters, but the bluegill BLT was definitely the headline; wow !! They have a Friday fish fry with the bluegill too and I can't wait to return. Jason and Carrie behind the bar and the experienced and knowledgeable wait staff, all managed by Tim were phenomenal. If you live in Madison r are just passing through this is a must try destination ! Oh yeah, Free Parking !!"}
{"text":"Have now had three meals here, and I have been a few other times for beers and apps.  Not quite five stars, but on its way.  First, the two burgers I have had were both fantastic.  Clearly, they are using quality beef.  The fried onions on the Mushroom/Swiss were cooked in what tasted like a wine sauce, and they made this a flavor full burger.  The G&B burger was even better, one of my new favorites in Madison.  Unique and satisfying burger.  I had the patty melt one other time, and it was disappointing.  It was greasy, and I think they used too much butter on the bread.  Also, while I like little twists on a classic, I just didn't think the sauerkraut/mustard combo was right for patty melt.  Just one guys opinion, but the opinion of a life long patty melt lover.  The cheese curds are also obviously hand made with their own batter, and I love the dill dipping sauce that comes with them.   The selection of beers on tap is spot on.  Some unique choices, but not different just for different's sake. For example, the great Chech beer Staropramen on tap - bravo!  Finally, fun atmosphere that is bright and lively.    One problem - parking.  Give yourself time to find a spot and be ready to walk."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow at first but picked up.  The 'spicy' park wings were not spicy at all but delicious!  The clam chowder was just ehhh.  Burgers my husband and I got were great.  Coleslaw was pretty good too.  Overall great food.  We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Not great but consistently good and it's become a place that I keep returning to after a rough start. Really good ambiance and good service and a great neighborhood asset.  I give it 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Quick, friendly service, great atmosphere.  Good food.  We liked the shrimp fritters a lot!"}
{"text":"Sooooooooooo my biggest pet peeve when I read reviews on Yelp (What?! Madison's Community Manager reads reviews? Truth. Usually 15-25/day.) is when people write, \"I really wanted to like this place.\" Can we just all agree that when you patronize a local business you want to indeed like it? Who goes into a place and thinks, \"Man I hope this blows chunks!\" With that said...  I really hoped I was going to love Gates & Brovi. Yes, the people that brought us Sardine and Marigold have sure built up a reputation in town, and maybe that set the bar and my expectations too high. The newness of it all and the freshman feel of the place got me and my chef friend pontificating about what we'd do to make it Madison's next best thing. We came up with a few ideas.   1. It should be a seafood restaurant. The decor is already there just tack up some nets and a mermaid, swap the benches for a long banquet, ditch the cafeteria feel and go with community tables and replace the uncomfortable bar stools with something that has a back.  2. Keep the neighborhood feel (important for that side of town) but elevate the food. Hang on to the oysters but give us more interesting add ons, swap the burger for a Po Boy, and fill out the menu with a few options that aren't fried.   3. Beer program could be expanded a tiny bit, but I'm not sure there's real estate at the bar for more taps.   Now is Gates & Brovi going to revamp the entire concept? No. Should they? No. Is it fun to sit at the bar (which is STUNNING btw, big ups for the woodwork) and dream... yup!   They saw a need for something that Monroe was missing, they jumped at the chance to fill the void, and in time they'll iron out weird service kinks (our bartender friend was a little shifty) they'll ditch some of the parm on the arugula salad (holy cheese batman) and they'll have a fun atmosphere for a lunch and after-work crowd. I'm excited to go back and I'm excited to see how things evolve, because if anyone in town can notice where things aren't gelling and tighten up the operation it's these guys. And I'm pumped to return to Yelp and tell all of Madison when they do."}
{"text":"I was surprised when a friend asked to grab lunch here since I thought I had checked out most of the seafood restaurants in Madison - I guess it's easy to overlook some of the restaurants on Monroe! Gates & Brovi has a very casual, cute interior with booth seating near the windows and large tables. It also had a sports bar feel to it as well, with a full bar and bar stools. It is surprisingly quite large outside and seems like a pretty family-friendly restaurant. Despite its location, there is a map outside the front door stating places where customers can park for free nearby which is very helpful.  The food at Gates & Brovi is good, but nothing extremely unique. I do have to say that the presentation of the food is really well-done though - it is all set up tastefully and makes the dish look a lot fancier (and more Instagrammable!) There are multiple fried seafood offerings that aren't found in a lot of other restaurants, but there is nothing in the flavor or texture that really impressed me. A few of the items we tried:  - Clam Pie: 3/5. I was really intrigued by this dish initially but it wasn't what I expected. The clams are very tiny and incorporated as a topping on a pizza. However, the pizza itself is pretty greasy and the seafood flavor is very muted. I ended up adding a lot of seasoning myself and felt that it wasn't something I really ever needed to order again.  - Crispy Shrimp Cakes: 3/5. Again, a really beautiful dish. It comes with about 6 shrimp cakes which good to share, and some remoulade sauce. The battering was really thick though and deeply fried, which masked the actual shrimp flavor as well. I think the shrimp cakes also taste better without the remoulade sauce - I normally am a huge fan of remoulade, but their recipe is very strong and overpowers the natural flavors of shrimp. I think this dish could be a hit with a few minor modifications though.  - Cheese Curds: 3/5. Super beautiful cheese curds - they are really crisp looking and has some sort of green onion or seasoning in it. Unfortunately, they also did not taste as good as they looked. I wish the cheese curds were more melty on the inside, and a little greasier on the outside. In addition, the ranch sauce was pretty weird for me in flavor - something just tasted a little off.  I think that Gates & Brovi has a great foundation, but it could be improved upon easily with improved dipping sauces and a few taste tests. The service was fantastic and while I wasn't horribly blown away by this place, it is a nice place to stop in for some decent food if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Gates & Brovi is home to the best cheese curds in Madison. There, I said it. FIGHTIN' WORDS. Come at me, bro.  Everyone has their favorite place...but I would literally crawl to G & B for their battered curds. They're crispy and not soggy...how a real cheese curd should be. I have enjoyed everything I've ordered.   This place is amazing----I love the vibe, the food selection, and the craft cocktails.    Parking in this area is the only draw back. They have suggestions on their website, so I would plan ahead. It's an awesome option for those on bike----would be awesome if G & B invested in some established bike parking (I have yet to find a bike rack nearby...?)  Whether you're local or visiting....don't miss this place."}
{"text":"My Previous review:  I live in the neighborhood, so you can imagine how excited I was to have this new restaurant within walking distance.    WOW, what a HUGE disappointment!  No drink specials. No beer menu. No drink menu. Very small menu in general.  The bar stools are a joke. I couldn't find a coat rack anywhere. What's so hard about putting a hook under the bar?  I've been three times already and I probably won't go back for at least another six months or until they work out these kinks. The portions are small and the food was totally forgettable. Wedge salad was ok but small for the price. Chicken strips could've been good but unfortunately were cold. Chicken sandwich was almost insulting in size and average tasting at best. Shrimp fritters are definitely good but not good enough to make me come back for now. Fries were decent but others in the neighborhood are much better. My friend ate the lobster since they were out of the fish fry and he liked it. This place really needs to step up their menu!  Jacs is leaps and bounds better than G&B!  One good thing about this place is the decor. It has potential, but for now, I will be saying no thank you to G&B.  Current review: I love this place.  G&B burger is excellent, the parmesan wings are some of the best wings I've ever had. Sandwiches are good but small.   Drinks are way too expensive but very good.    Pizzas are good but forgettable.  Overall, I recommend."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a gluten free pizza with a crust that rivals any gluten crust, you must try the pizzas at Gates & Brovi. We recommend the clam pie with clams, roasted fennel, tomato sauce, cream, basil, mozzarella and parmesan - and to put it over the top, add some bacon. We've never been disappointed with the raw oysters here either. They have a great drink selection as well."}
{"text":"Have been three times and can highly recommend the clam pie and bluegill fish fry. Their coleslaw was super blah but everything else was good. Wait staff is just ok. The last time we visited we had a party of six and kind of got rushed out to free up the table. The waitress also didn't ask how we wanted to split the check and it ended up making things really complicated."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend last week. Agree that parking is kind of nightmare... however, once inside, the spacious wooden bar and well-trod wood floors felt warm and welcoming. We had the Green Goat pizza. The crust was a little burnt, but it was tasty nonetheless. I was still hungry a while later, so I had a cup of the clam chowder: very tasty, but a bit thin. I also had cheese curds. These were heavenly. The best I've had in Madison. Even the Ranch dressing was good, and I find Ranch usually repellent.  CONS: The wi-fi didn't work, and I needed it for the business I was there to conduct.  I felt like I was inconveniencing them when asking questions about the menu.   Hey, nobody is on all the time, eh? That's cool.  Lastly: I saw that they have clams and oysters on the menu, so I will definitely be back. Another Green Goat is also in my future. And one of those tequila drinks with jalapenos in it."}
{"text":"killer fish and chips--great local beer on tap--excellent service--Lincoln Park prices--nice!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to Gates and Brovi for dinner. Have had dinner here a handful of times. Every time the food is decent but never amazing. Today, my boyfriend and I opted for a pizza. The menu states they won't allow substitutions on specialty pizzas. We asked if we take off meat as I'm a vegetarian. Our waiter was more than happy to do so.   The pizza was pretty good. My boyfriend devoured his half. He ordered oysters as an appetizer. I've never had them but I know they shouldn't arrive with standing water in the half shell. In the words of my boyfriend, \"wow, those were just okay\".   I'd recommend this place for the nice atmosphere and great neighborhood. If you're looking for a place to hang, this is a good spot. Want to be blown away with your dinner, find another spot."}
{"text":"First time in, great service! It had a nice modern bar vibe but kept classic decor. I had oysters, Cesar salad, and a glass of wine - all of which were excellent. My favorite oysters in Madison so far!"}
{"text":"Waited 1:15 hr for our food.  Food was good but over priced.  No acknowledgement or apology for excessive.  Tonight was my last vusit."}
{"text":"There seems to be a cycle in new Madison restaurants lately:   1. Open your doors, 2. Bring in guests on the novelty factor, 3. Fail to offer a clean vision of what you're trying to do,  4. Stay afloat for a year or so, perhaps on strength outside your food, 5. Bring in a new executive chef, 6. Success in all things!  Gates & Brovi seems to be around steps 2 or 3 in the cycle. Given that they're run by the same folks who bring us such delight at Sardine, I'm confused at what they're trying to accomplish out Nakoma way.  Is the \"date night\" full lobster dinner also going to come in a red plastic basket? Does my melted butter come in a small paper cup?  For a restaurant with all the trappings of a barbecue joint (the baskets, the low end paper napkins which might as well be wrapping plasticware, the poor selection of non-beer drinks) there's only a faint nod towards BBQ in the form of a roasted pork sandwich.   I'm not really sure what G&B is trying for. Perhaps they want to be a simple neighborhood joint, and I just don't live in the neighborhood. Maybe it didn't help that my first attempt to go was at the end of a lovely stroll on a Monday evening only to be unpleasantly surprised that they were closed. [Which is a thing that restaurants can do, food service can have their own weekend, but there's either a certain level of cuisine or a Mom and Pop behind the counter. G&B meets neither of these.]  Neither my sandwich nor my friend's was memorable. The waitress seemed easily confused by our requests, and pretty much vanished at several points. I might be convinced to try out the bar if I happen to be in the neighborhood, but otherwise I'll be giving G&B a rest for a few months to see if they make it to steps 5 and 6 in the cycle."}
{"text":"I visited this place during a special event ($1 per oyster!). The oysters were big and fat and very fresh! Such a good deal :) The other food we ordered were also well done."}
{"text":"Excellent new spot with great seafood and drinks. I had the fisherman's stew and it was fantastic. Portion size left me stuffed. They have a little of everything and not too pricey."}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner at Gates & Brovi on our most recent visit. Our food was excellent and service was pretty good. Add that to a cozy atmosphere on a winter night and you can't beat it.  We went right around 5:30 which was fortunate as the place seems to fill up around 6 or so. The host seated us in a booth towards the kitchen, but our waitress was prompt in getting us water and explaining the specials.  I decided on the seafood cannelloni special and my friend got the salmon burger. We ordered the cheese curds as an appetizer. The curds were excellent! I wasn't expecting them to be since this place is known for pizza and burgers, but they have their own recipe going and I think the ranch was even homemade. Who knew!  I also loved the seafood cannelloni; it had big chunks of shrimp and scallops with a delicious sauce over top both cannelloni. Again, better than what I was expecting for G&B. I'm taking off one star for the portion size (small) and the price (high). I would have left hungry if not for the curds appetizer.  Overall, the space is charming and their food is high quality. It's a bit off the beaten path, so probably best for a weeknight date. They have a good happy hour too!"}
{"text":"Go to the Laurel... Seriously. This place seems like a great idea but does not deliver on food OR service. The menu is small, and I get what they are trying to do but if you have a small selection I expect everything to be spot on. I had the fish sandwich which was kind of cold and the bun that it was on was soggy, which was far from appetizing. My sister had the shrimp which were good, definitely the best thing that my party ordered. We got the french fries for an appetizer and they were seriously worse than McDonalds! Ouch! (I know, but it's the truth). The service was weird and the decor confusing. All in all just go to the Laurel... or Culver's and save yourself some money!"}
{"text":"We've been to Gates and Brovi a handful of times now. We've had all good experiences. We mostly come for their oyster happy hour. It used to be $1 a oyster but they raised the price recently to $1.25 I believe. It still a good deal and the oysters are always fresh.  I also really enjoy their fried cheese curds, some of the best in Madison. A very light coating of breading served with a delicious ranch dressing. Their fries are also really good, they are very thin and crispy. I have had a pasta dish with sausage and clams and it was super good. They have pizza but we haven't tried it yet. They have a nice cocktail menu and the drinks are always good. This is also a nice place for kids.  Parking can sometimes be a little tricky. They don't have their own lot and you cant park in in it until after 6 or 7. So its mostly street parking before that."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to get over to Monroe St and check out Gates & Brovi.  The yelp reviews on here were such a mixed bag that I wasn't sure what to expect, but it looked like a cosy place from the outside and I generally like the Monroe street establishments.  We went on a Friday night after work, which I'd expect would be crazy busy but we were in the mood for a new place.  It was reasonably busy considering, but they have a lot of open space so it didn't feel like it.  I'll agree with other Yelpers here that the acoustics are pretty bad, being that it's one giant room.  The atmosphere was fairly loud, although you can still hold a conversation.  The wait for a booth was going to be a while so we snagged a seat at the bar.  They had one bartender for about 20-25 people there.  He was a nice guy but not terribly attentative, and we were probably there a half hour more than we needed to be as a result.  I ordered an Old Fashioned and wasn't too happy with the taste, but otherwise was enjoying a Friday night out.  Based on the bartender's suggestions my wife ordered a G&B burger and I ordered the lasagna special with side salad, along with some cheese curds for an appetizer.  The cheese curds were really good as others had mentioned, I'd definitely rank them pretty high up for the Madison area.  My wife enjoyed her burger, but my lasagna was extremely mediocre, which I was surprised by since it's virtually impossible to mess up pasta.  It just had a bland taste and a sauce that didn't do much for it.  Prices were expensive.  Granted we had a few beers, but at the end of the meal our check was $70/75 after tip for two people.  If this were a place that I felt had more going for it I'd be comfortable with that amount, but I don't think I'll be making a return visit.  Even if some food choices are better than others, the atmosphere is too disjointed, certainly not the cosy interior I perceived from driving by."}
{"text":"My family loves Gates and Brovie ; it's a regular dinner and brunch stop for us. Their fried cheese Kurds are the best in Madison. I'm also a big fan of the clam chowder. All the food is good. The atmosphere is loud and friendly. Perfect."}
{"text":"Great ambience...crab shack meets Wisconsin. Had a dozen oysters, each was big and delicious. A lb of shrimp for dinner boiled in a beer broth. My wife had a seafood stew, which was the special, wouldn't mind seeing that on the menu permanently. I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"I love love love the happy hour oysters! The burgers are amazing and so are the Parmesan garlic wings! Decent service. Great location and cozy family feel. The one thing I didn't like was the steep increase in price for the beer-steamed shrimp. They used to be one of my favorites until they doubled the price."}
{"text":"This place has kind of a weird east coast harbor decoration theme or something to that effect.   Decor aside this is one of the better food joints that also has TV's. The fish fry is a good dish. The portion size here is pretty good (if you want a lot of food.) The burger  scores  7.5 out of 10.  Also full bar is quieter than the downtown scene so getting a table is more likely. Good soundtrack as well music at a reasonable volume.  Parking nearby. Serves food 'til 10 on weeknights."}
