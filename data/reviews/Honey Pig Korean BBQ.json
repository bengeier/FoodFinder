{"text":"It wasn't the end of the world, but a waitress knocked over our bottle of soju and she said, oh it was only about a shot that was spilled. At this point, it has nothing to do with a shot of soju. Am I asking too much? A mere apology for the fact that she knocked over our bottle and spilled \"a shot\" of soju?   I brought this up to her and all I got from her was, okay I will pay for your loss out of my pocket!   Amazing! Just amazing service!  If you teach your servers how to apologize, I see a huge potential in this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and it was by far one of my new favorite places for AYCE KBBQ. First off, the happiest servers I've ever seen. So kind and attentive. They are the type of Kbbq where they come to the table and help you cook. They actually ask if you like things a little more overcook instead of just assuming you'll eat it however they cook it. Also the kimchi is delicious. I always hated kimchi but their kimchi made me into a believer. The meat selection was great and always gracious/kind when we would ask for more sesame oil or seaweed salad. Definitely would come back again to try dinner time and again and again."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite ayce Korean bbq restaraunt! The staff is great and attentive. The food is very fresh and they aren't out of anything, unlike other korean bbq restaraunts. Check in for a free dessert & try using a radish wrap instead super fresh!"}
{"text":"Went again...Of course We had another Korean Meal that was just being back in Korea. Wife had Squid plate.  Me, same old Bean soup.    The Kimchee's are Authentic here..Must try"}
{"text":"This place just opened last Monday. It's an EAYC Korean restaurant but they have a limit on the shrimps. 3 orders per table and there's only 2 shrimps per order. It was such a joke! The servers were slow and we constantly had  to follow up and wait for the meat to come. I am definitely never gonna come back."}
{"text":"When we came in, nobody's up front the receiving area. We had to wait like 8 mins for someone to assist us, but no biggie! The service was good! Food was great, place was not noisy at all and the manager was very proficient with all the customers."}
{"text":"We've been coming here late nights after night outs and it never disappoint. Sometimes service can be hit or miss depending on how many workers are there. Get the set menu with fried rice at the end, that's the best part!"}
{"text":"This is a difficult review to write because I love Korean BBQ and this place looked very appealing. Visited on a Friday night. Restaurant was out of a lot of beverage and food items. Service was inconsistent at best. It seemed like some of the staff were new and one of the servers were picking up the slack. Food was ok, but it was well below other Korean BBQ places I have been to."}
{"text":"1000 times better than the other location!  First off, it's smaller and not as busy.  Of course that is something they cannot control.   Second, the service is AMAZING! Both girls serving us were great.  Jamie was sweet and served us with a smile each time she approached our table.  I felt she genuinely liked her job.  (Very much unlike the one on Spring Mountain)  Third, food was good as always.    Will definitely come back again.  For sure!"}
{"text":"Food: The food was great! Not as many choices as some KBBQ places but options given were pretty good!   Service:  The service was great and unlike most KBBQ places the staff cooks the food for you! Our server Jamie was awesome!"}
{"text":"Did Uber eats. Ordered the straight flush bento and it was delicious. I want to try the ayce. This is my new Korean spot.. if your craving Korean you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was ok, and way to pricey for lunch. Also to many rules for the all you can eat, i.e. Only one hour to order!!  Whaatt"}
{"text":"Didn't love it. AYCE that isn't...if that makes sense.  Asked for vegetables. 2 people eating, we each got 2 mushrooms and 2 slices of zucchini.  Meats round 2: already limited portions reduced by half. Weird that the waitress stands over you and does the cooking. Its Korean BbQ....not Japanese Teppanyaki."}
{"text":"Terrible experience! My family and I visited the Honey Pig location on Spring Mountain once and weren't impressed. I was craving Korean bbq one night and didn't wanna drive far. So, I thought I'd give this location a shot. Never again!  There were 5 in our party- 4 adults and 1 child. All other Korean bbq places I've been to serve enough food for the table. We initially put in an order of brisket and short ribs for the table to start. They literally brought us ONE serving of brisket... one serving. Barely enough to to feed the child. Unlike other Korean bbq, the server cooks the food, not the guests. They put the 10 thinly sliced pieces of brisket on the burner, left the tongs out of our reach, and took forever to come back. Our food started to burn, so we stood up to grab the tongs and cook it ourselves. We each had 1-2 pieces of brisket. We sat staring and waiting in hunger waiting for more. The short Ribs came. It was 2 4-5 inch long pieces. We realized we had to order by servings at this point. So, we ordered 5 more servings of brisket, more short ribs, 5 servings of shrimp, and other stuff. The server looked at us surprised saying, \"5 serving of brisket?! Like a lot?\" Us- \"yes. A lot. 5 of the plates you brought earlier.\" Again, the 2 short ribs cooking and about to burn, so we cooked em ourselves. Took at least 15min for them to bring another platter of brisket. Literally 20 pieces. While waiting, we watched them bring heaps of food, including brisket, to customers that came after us. After finishing off the little food they brought so far, we reminded them that we were still waiting for our 5 orders of shrimp, and we tried to order more brisket. We repeated this last request 5 more times, because they never brought the shrimp or brisket. Fially, the shrimp came. Exactly 5 small barely 2 inch pieces of shrimp. After being there nearly 2hrs, (between the 5 of us to share) we were served 3 servings of brisket, 2 maybe 5 inch pieces of short rib, 2 slices of pork belly, and 5 shrimp.   Although it is all you can eat, they tallied our orders on the receipt, which showed that that gave us 7 order of shrimp, 10 orders of brisket, 2 orders each of short rib and pork belly.   The restaurant was less than half full. Others who came after us were served first and seemed to have quicker service and more food.  I will continue to avoid Honey Pig. Much more worth it to drive to a place that does it right."}
{"text":"They have really good lunch specials (11-3) take out. There's 5 different options and it's pretty cheap, plus the staff is always super nice"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Awesome service! Awesome food it was very clean as well ! The pricing was just right as well! When we come back to Vegas we're coming back to eat here!"}
{"text":"We just ate there for their soft opening, let me tell you for as slammed as they were they were on top of everything! The staff is very friendly! And the food was amazing! We'll definitely be repeat customers, thank you!!"}
{"text":"Serah and Jin were awesome! Food was awesome. It's so great to have a Korean BBQ place in Henderson."}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to try this place. We normally have lunch in one of the other places in the plaza. The minute we walked in, the smell was amazing !!! We've never had Korean BBQ before and this was an experience. So yummy ! We had the all you can eat lunch and were blown away. We'll be back for sure !"}
{"text":"My friends treated me to a surprise birthday dinner and was I ever surprised. I ate and ate until my hearts content. In fact, I over ate because I didn't want the experience to stop. The place was new and clean. The service was superb and the food was amazingly tasty. If you live near the Eastern and 215 area, you don't have to go far to enjoy some really good Korean BBQ. They even blessed me with a free dessert. Thank you for making my birthday a memorable one."}
{"text":"This place is freaking incredible!!!  Newly opened and its about time a korean bbq came over to Henderson!  Has everything you could ask for and more!  Rib eye, steak, pork, meat, meat, and more meat.  Its an experience you need beginning to end!  Eat, drink and be merry!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for my first time and not impress with the food. AYCE (All You Can Eat) during lunch time (17$ 11am-3pm) is kind of whack (limit time AYCE LUNCH  is 1 hour, pretty reasonable I guess), you have very limited options in meat choices compared to Gen KBBQ at the Galleria mall on Sunset Rd (NO SHRIMP OPTION FOR AYCE LUNCH HERE if you want that). And also for the sides (kimchi, rice, and the other etc.) it is nothing like other KBBQ sides, most places have it set and ready for you. Here, you have to order your sides, and its hard to choose because its not much to choose from. This place is kind of quaint unlike other KBBQ Places. However it is convenient for those who live near or close to Eastern Ave. Henderson side who is looking for a KBBQ place to eat. Soda drinks is 2$ and a few change per can (yes, per can). So no free refills! Didn't bother with asking about water because Tea is their complimentary drink and they serve it by the pitcher, honestly its not the best at least for me. The cup for the Tea is small  btw... Oh! Make sure, to request for more extra tiny plates or bowls to put your meats into after cooking it to your liking cause we only had the plate/ bowl looking dish that your tea cup is on when you are assigned to your Table for our meats after we cooked it. If you love your kimchi cold PLEASE advise your server that. I didn't realize till she already dumped it onto our grill that it was the kimchi. My husband just scooped it off litterallly minutes after her putting it on the grill, back into the bowl so it wasn't cooked or heated. All in all, it didn't hurt to try another KBBQ place near us just to see and say we tried  it. But Gen KBBQ is so far our favorite still and worth driving too. To each their own! This was our experience. Service though was okay! Poor server  lady was alone, so for her I give her huge kudos."}
{"text":"Never coming back again. The service is horrible and the meat is not good at all.   There are only 2 waitress total for the whole restaurant on a Saturday.  We sat here for 15 mins before she came to get our order.   Also you can only order 2 dishes at a time with all you can eat.  With the super slow and unfriendly service.  This has been a fairly painful meal for us.   And the food really isn't good. The meat was so sweet and the side dishes were not yummy at all.  Btw. Only 3 side dishes serve here.  At Goong, I believe they serve 10 side dishes.  Even they are not all you can eat.  At the end the bill was cheaper and the meat quality is way better.  Very disappointed with honey pig today.  The one in Chinatown was way better"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Great staff!  Great food!  Worth the price!  Might be a little hard for little kids, but the staff is fabulous!  Very worthy well-run restaurant."}
{"text":"Great environment and delicious food. It's a bit small but really great environment. The lunch all you can eat price was $17.99 and worth it. You can upgrade to the dinner all you can eat menu. The waitress was kind and offered to cook for us."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and it was \"just good\". But, recently went there and they took away their AYCE. The place was empty on a Saturday night at 7:00pm. Now I see why. They cook the fried rice at the end of the meal which makes no sense at all. Rice DURING the meal is how most eat their meats. Not at the end when everyone is full. If you want rice during, its extra charge. Also, the service is just ok. But then attitudes sort of change when God forbid you ask for more than a couple things..... Like more water filled in the container, or maybe a cup to put the water in, etc. Very disappointed. Will never go back. We love Gen which the food is way better, the service is way better and it's still close, at Galleria Mall. Honey Pig is a waste of money since they took their AYCE away. Again, dead on a Saturday night at 7pm. 2 tables filled."}
{"text":"It is back!!  AYCE at the best Korean BBQ.   Great service and great food.   Glad they went back to the AYCE.  Happy eating."}
{"text":"We dined in once for a bbq combo rather than AYCE for dinner. However, this review is mostly for the to-go service.   For the most part, I occasionally order to-go through UBEReats from here. BIGGEST PET PEEVE is when ordering two entrees, they only give one order of rice, as in rice enough for only one of the entrees. Does that even make sense? It's happened on plenty of occasions to the point I have to make sure I back up rice at home.   Last night I ordered the bibimbap and beef short rib soup and again, just one rice. It says on the menu that each come with their own rice. Are they that stingy on RICE? Other requests I have such as extra hot pepper sauce or no green onions are easily fulfilled but something that is supposed to be included is incomplete. I'm honestly scared to order more than two items thinking I won't have enough rice for three or four dishes.  On another note the beef short rib soup is heavenly. Tender pieces of meat falling off the bone in a simple but rich beef broth flavored with daikon, mushrooms, green onions, and onions. It came with noodles once but last night's didn't have it..  Bibimbap had mushrooms, lettuce, kosari, zucchini, bean sprouts, carrots and meat plus fried egg. Comes with the hot pepper paste and sesame oil on the side. All toppings come warm or cold. It also came with a side of miso soup which is Korean-style and spicy! There's jalapeno, tofu, zucchini, and onions which was reminiscent of korean soy bean paste soup.  Kalbi and whole chicken in ginseng soup are both okay. Soondubu has been watery and bland at times.  Consistency just isn't there."}
{"text":"Our servers were very helpful and attentive.  They were  very knowledgeable and guided us in the right direction. The meats were fresh and so juicy. We tried the spicy squid, the sirloin, the short ribs, pork belly and of course brisket. Delicious food and of high quality.  We recommend this place for Korean BBQ and for our henderson and las vegas residents to come and enjoy this great food!"}
{"text":"I'm Korean and I get very picky with Korean food. To be honest there are very few korean restaurants that I like in the valley. But honey pig in henderson location did not disappoint me at all. Service was top-notch and the food was amazingly good. Banchan (side dish) was also very good. They also offered a promo where you can get 20% off on your order when you check in from you facebook. I would have to say that if you like kbbq just give this place a try and you will not be disappointed. I am planning on trying out their AYCE menu next time. What I love the most about this location is that it's closer to my place :)"}
{"text":"Haven't tried the dinner or BBQ here yet. Came here for lunch once and all their lunch specials looked good. We tried the spicy pork and the chicken. You get a fill plate of sides and rice with meat. Very good value and great food."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money and go ayce BBQ elsewhere if you want more bang for your buck! You are only allowed one strip of kalbi? I mean come on, really? Not your traditional Korean BBQ. The service is ok, and the tables are just way too small. It's nice to have a Korean restaurant nearby but I would rather drive to Chinatown for my money's worth. Or better yet, just go to ayce sushi joint instead."}
{"text":"Bean paste soup, salad, brisket, beef short ribs, kimchi, and pork belly was delicious. I wasn't too happy with the fact that there wasn't a lot of sides, so overall it was ok."}
{"text":"I am much happier with my meal this time around.  The restaurant has come a long way since it had opened.   I feel like the flavors and quality all around are better.   The service has come up as well.  This time the server cooked most of our meal for us.  Nothing was overdone.   We decided to go with the preset menu over the all you can eat. It was a great deal and the two of us left very satisfied.   I ordered the steamed egg separately as it didn't come with the preset.  However it did take a very long time to arrive. I will be more on top of reminding them next time."}
{"text":"I come to Vegas 2-4 times a year and every time I visit, I make a effort to come here. The food is authentic and flavors are great! I'm a foodie and know my korean food since I own my market and catering business back home. The spicy braised short ribs are absolutely amazing if you like spice. My husband can't even eat anything spicy but will eat the spicy short ribs because it's that good. The only thing that bothered me was one time I went, I found a cockroach under the flipped over water cup. Still ended up eating there and will continue to go back. Service is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Lovely.  This place is new and I'm happy to have an addition of Korean bbq to this part of town.  I was in the area as I usually go to China Town for places like this.  Workers are nice, food is good, & overall the environment.  We got the brisket & bulgogi& it was delicious.  My only request would be to have more choices as side dishes.  For instance my favorite place in china town has mashed potatoes & kimchi.  But other than this it is worth checking out and in a convenient location."}
{"text":"Me and about 8 of the guys decided to eat here after some morning hiking. I honestly wasn't too excited because I've had Honey Pig in the past and didn't like it too much but that was at the Spring Mountain location many years ago. We took our seats and started looking over the menu. Everyone was obviously doing the All You Can Eat, we was hungry. The 1st couple of rounds of meats were brought out and cooked for us. And of course we ate them. Everything was good and delicious. Nothing too crazy but already better than my past experiences at Honey Pig. And then the beef rib eyes came out. I was like wow those are some nice looking quality of meats. I was expecting some tiny or decent quality ones but nope and they're AYCE not just order one and that's it. As soon as I ate it and loved it and had to order more. I don't even remember how many I ordered but I just kept ordering and eating. There was one point were everyone said they were done but I wasn't and ordered more. After it was brought out and cooked one of the guys started reaching for some. In my mind I was like \"Yo you'll said you were done. What you doing? This is all mine.\" I let them eat their last few and called it quits eventually.   Anyways I liked everything about this location. Its clean and nice looking. The workers were friendly and quick. They'll cook the food for you if they aren't busy. I love how the cooking surface seems like it doesn't need to be replaced. That's one of my biggest complaints at other KBBQ places I've been to. They have your usually KBBQ selections from brisket, pork belly, spicy chicken, short-ribs, shrimps, etc. I'd definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just glad to have an authentic korean restaurant in Henderson.  I've gone back four times so far and every time the food was on point! I have 2 person bbq special with soy bean soup and fried rice that's made with kimchi and bean sprouts (yumny!!!)... a lot of food and took home the rice both times. Spicy kimchi tofu soup was one of the best I've had.  Better than BCD tofu restaurant in Los Angeles imo... kimchi soup was equally delicious!"}
{"text":"We expected this place to be better or at least close to the one in LA. Meat quality was not good. For 2 adults and 2 young kids we order the beef combo for 4-5 people thinking it would be plenty of meat. The portions were small with a lot of fat. Plus the meat quality did not meet the standards of an 8yr old. He said it was tough and chewy. Was not impressed with the service. Would not go back again."}
{"text":"Just ordered for the second time from this place via uber eats.  I haven't tasted it but I'm already annoyed. I specifically asked for extra chili paste in the side and got none. They also left out the ban Chan. As a Korean ordering from a Korean place I'm annoyed.   Their bibimbap is good but next time I'll just have to call after I order to make sure they don't jip me"}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé went their for the first time. The brisket was good and so are their side dishes. BUT their service sucks, well when we went there at least. We waited like 20 mins for the server to give us water and another 10 mins or so to order. Also they didn't have a lot on their eat-all-you-can menu and we paid almost 30 dollars for each. I would have rather go to DOH or Korean Garden bbq and get the same good food with more options."}
{"text":"I love their decorations and the environment. The place was fancy and have a lot of private seats just incase you want some privacy. We were greeted and seated right away. Since we were the only customers that walked in that night.  Our host and servers were nice. and they always check on us.  It was $24.95 for ayce dinner,and even if I really like the service, it still couldn't make up for the food service . The food was a little disappointment, the lack of flavors also they don't have a lot of options for ayce. Just like 5 different things, and the best one would be the short ribs but they limited it only once as a person.  like why? I pay $25 bucks for ayce and yet I can't choose or eat anything freely. Others stuffs are just so plain, (except the marinated roast beef) and such small portion. They don't have a lot of drinks options either, just fountain drinks or rice tea.  Also, we felt a little uncomfortable at the end because our server kept staring and waiting for us to be done. Ok we get it you need to close but if you don't allow us to bring any drinks out and we just paid $12 bucks for it then u gonna have to wait for us to finish with it.  It was a disappointment for us because we were expecting more out of it. It was just one extra star for the service. The place isn't all that, and u can drive a few extra miles for better taste. Maybe it was just grand opening, perhaps we will give it a second try."}
{"text":"Wow what a great place ! Food was excellent and on point,  been here during morning and nights. I really prefer the mornings awesome service and very quick! At nights there always many waitresses but seems to be much slower and the service is actually is bad. I mean the waitress just talk and giggle in the back when actually customers are needing things I've seen it many times. Anyways overall the food is great ! There's a young girl that works in the mornings her name is Jamie wow what a sweet girl and very hard worker ! I've seen this girl literally serve 7 tables on her own with no help and every customer was all smiles , even asked her where's all your help ??? Please everyone come in the mornings ask for Jamie and your meal and your day will be just sooooo great and refreshed !"}
{"text":"Best service I have ever had at AYCE Korean BBQ! Being pescatarian, love that they have lots of seafood options."}
{"text":"Went there for our anniversary because I wanted something simple and something me and my husband would enjoy.  We loved this place. I'm glad we have a Korean spot near by because we hate to drive to China Town all the time. They also help you cook the food too so you can enjoy eating then flipping the meat time to time. Customer service is great!!! This will be our new Korean spot"}
{"text":"I'm not an expert Yelp reviewer so I'll keep it short and to the point. The food was delicious and the staff was great. Being that I live in Henderson I'm loving the fact that Honey Pig is close by and I don't have to drive far for excellent Korean BBQ. I will definitely be back. Great stuff.  The Jose"}
{"text":"This is the bomb.com. The food is very tasty and service top notch. Been here twice now and still cant find a fault."}
{"text":"Brought my daughters here for what we like to call \"ladies lunch\" and it did not disappoint. Before visiting a restaurant I always Yelp for help (yeah I know kind of corny, but hey it works, okay....okay, I digress) but this trip I didn't use yelp. So I didn't really know what to expect. Upon entering we were greeted, which was welcoming. We've had Korean food before, just not the Korean bbq style that this restaurant offers. We received great service, our waitress was very attentive and the food was delicious. I will bring my husband here on our next visit.   Side note: I accidentally left my iPad at the restaurant, but they were honest and promptly returned it to me."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my fiancé and future sister-in-law. We were excited to try this new place that just opened in Green Valley. Service was great and food was so good. This is now our new go to place for AYCE."}
{"text":"food was okay. I was expecting much more because of the reviews on this site. Service is terrible, the host/server lady with the fake contacts was not nice at all and was not even enthusiastic the moment we entered the door. Sorry, Nothing to look back to. :/"}
{"text":"As someone who has tried many KBBQ restaurants in Vegas, I would give Honey Pig an average rating. Not bad but not great, just alright. The main thing I don't like is that your waiter cooks your meat. I'm used to being in charge of the tongs and cooking my meat according to my liking. We'd grab the tongs and start placing the meat on the grill. Then the waitress would come over and take the tongs back and start moving the meat around. Lol. Only after we asked her, \"Are we not allowed to cook the meat ourselves?\" did she give us the tongs back. Lastly, the fried rice is cooked at the very end after all your meat is grilled. I personally like to enjoy my meat and rice together in a meal, not after I'm already done with the main course. We ended up making our own fried rice off to the side while the meat was cooking and that turned out just the same. If I'm desperately craving KBBQ and I'm in the Henderson area, I'll come here. Otherwise i'll stick to my other KBBQ restaurants on Spring Mountain, much cheaper, more options, and better quality."}
{"text":"Very good Korean BBQ. I was there for lunch but went for the \"all day pricing\" so I could get the short ribs ( and they were excellent!) The menu said that if you don't eat everything they will charge you so this became a concern when my ribeye was over cooked to the point of being chewy and inedible. I was able to eat about half of it and they didn't charge me extra. I also had the spicy pork belly which was outstanding! The kimchee was great also! Overall: very nice, clean, great food and a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I'm going 3.5 stars there is better places for BBQ I only had the (Ace) lunch special the main protein was Bulgogi I found it to be cooked wrong it seemed to have been boiled at some point and I thought it lacked flavor. The interior and staff are great the size of portions were generous and well presented. I will be back for the AYCE some time soon and hopefully then I can upgrade my review to 4 stars I am just happy to see new restaurants coming in to this plaza."}
{"text":"This place is authentic Korean food. Please don't go here and expect an American flavor of Korean because you will not get it. Each table has its own hot pot - which makes going with friends fun. We tried their bento lunch specials - which was good. The squid was perfectly cooked - so yummy even I ate 2 bites and I hate squid. I would recommend the hotpot experience though - that is fun to try."}
{"text":"I have been to honey pig in Henderson three times. The first time I went. I had great service and the food was delicious. I was super excited that I wouldn't have to drive to spring mountain to get korean food.   Second time I went... the veggies were subpar, meat was good... service not so much. I felt like I was in war with the server. We asked to cook the meat ourselves and she was not happy about that. She seemed put off and very unhappy with our other requests. Also I asked her for something in Korean and she didn't understand ( not to say she had to, but please don't give me attitude because I assumed you were Korean. She was Asian )   Third time I went... I will have to say I'll never go back. I watched the server go to a table that just finished up. Pick up the lettuce leafs they didn't finish and wash it off and put more lettuce in the bowl and bring it to me for my request. I asked if this is their normal procedure. If I didn't see it with my own eyes! I would not have believe it. Now I have to wonder about how they handle their meats and their cleaning procedures. I've never been to a Korean place I found to be this disturbing. I am Korean and Love Korean food. This puts shame to the owners at Honey pig!"}
{"text":"Honestly...this is my absolute favorite restaurant in all of Vegas, maybe even the entire world. I've been to this new location twice now and it is very beautiful aesthetically but I've been a long-time, die hard fan of their Spring Mountain and LA locations and I've been stuffing my face there for nearly a decade! You just HAVE to try their signature, Honeycomb Pork Belly which is the most deliciously marinated meat in the world. Their regular Pork Belly and Marinated Beef Short Ribs are equally out of this world. The boss lady and the waitresses that always take care of us here are super friendly and courteous. Not to mention, they are pros at BBQ-ing! They recently changed their AYCE menu to \"a la carte\" and judging by a few reviews I read below, some people are hating on them.How can you hate the best K-BBQ restaurant around for serving quality food at reasonable prices?  For those of you who don't know, the original Honey Pig from LA was never an AYCE spot and only specialized in the finest and fattest cuts of the best pork belly! AYCE is almost always complete crap (as most of y'all already know!) and everyone knows U GET WHAT U PAY FOR! =)"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Honey Pig Henderson on 3 different occasions.   The first time the food was excellent and the services was rocky. We attributed this to being a new location and everyone was just getting up to speed.   The second visit was about three weeks later with the same quality of food but slower service. No big deal still within a few months of opening! Enjoyable but still the service was a big distraction.  Fast forward to today... My wife and father attempted to eat here, but were not even acknowledged by three different servers! (all walked past us to print checks for various departing tables). When we entered there were about 5 un-bussed tables, some with meat still burning on the cooktops. About twenty minutes passed with us waiting to be acknowledged as customers before we simply walked across the street to Hot n' Juicy Crawfish.   Honey Pig was short staffed and didn't attempt to hide it. A simple greeting from a host of some type would have at least let us know they were interested in getting us a freshly bussed table!  If you want to make it I would up the customer service portion of your restaurant! I want to like it but if you don't care why should I?"}
{"text":"This place renewed by faith in Korean BBQ! We got the All you can eat deal and was worth every penny! Standouts was the bulgolgi and the seasoned pork belly. The kimche was placed on the cooking dish which I prefered bc I don't like cold cabbage. The waitresses came by and essentially turned the meat over and cooked it all for us at the table which I am glad bc I had no clue as to if the meat was done or not.   We first asked for the fried rice which they serve at the end of the meal and cook it on the surface where all your delicious meats and kimche cooked on and left little morsels behind giving it an unbelievable infusion of flavor into the fried rice so definitely save room for that little gem of flavor at the end of your meal.  Amazing service though, all around!"}
{"text":"Was craving KBBQ, especially some bomb ass pork belly, last Sunday so decided to check this place out. They also have a location in Chinatown.   AYCE deal is $27 per person. Their meats are pretty good. Pork belly was as good as I expected. It only makes sense, because they have pig in their name. I love their big ass stone grill (no holes in them), because it cooks and carmelizes the meats evenly. They also place the kimchi and bean sprouts on the grill for you which is kind of neat.   Not much variety in the banchan. You also only get one order of kalbi and jumulluk per person which is kind of disappointing.  Restaurant is clean. Servers were nice.   Will I be back? Who knows, considering there are a lot of options for KBBQ now in this city."}
{"text":"What a treat!! Finally we have BBQ place in Henderson!! We have been waiting for Korean BBQ place and honey pig is great! excellent service and food, meat quality is awesome!! Love and love this place!!"}
{"text":"Was craving Korean BBQ and this one was pretty close to me and it said grand opening so I figured I would try it out.   The food was good and the service was pretty bad.   Walk in and was seated pretty fast, the restaurant wasn't that full and there were plenty of servers. We sat down and looked at the menu (which takes about 5-10 mins). Now the Korean BBQ places I've been too give you your waters and salads and macaroni or whatever, but here no one came and offered us even water for 30 mins. When you've been waiting that long for a water you can get pretty annoyed.  So we finally get our water and order our food, we had AYCE and the food was good.  Now another weird thing that I felt is that they didn't really let us cooked our own food, which is the whole experience of the KBBQ. Whenever they saw us using our chopsticks to kind of move the meat around the would run over and tell us no and then move it themselves.  Wasn't too happy with the whole experience I had hear and I would honestly rather find somewhere else that was a little more traditional."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant!amazing service!The employees are so friendly!The food is beyond expectations!I recommend this restaurant to all residents,tourists and all!"}
{"text":"Got some bulgogi delivered to me, they're pretty over-priced here. They're fairly new on this side of town.. maybe its because of that. All the better korean bbq places are in Chinatown, which is a little bit of a drive. Maybe I need to actually sit down there and cook the bbq myself, because I just wasn't impressed with their cooked selection for delivery. Will do an updated review soon, this is based solely on their cooked delivery option."}
{"text":"I had a really good lunch here. Food was high quality and delicious. At first glance, the restaurant seemed very pricey.  I ordered the #3 combo and was presented with an enormous array of food. Turns out it was probably intended for multiple people but the menu didn't really specify that. I was stuffed when it came time to leave. Service was very attentive. Good place overall but next time in bringing friends."}
{"text":"There are many Korean bbq place along spring mountain, but this one is the closest to our home in Hendo.  We got the three pork item combo (pork belly, pork neck, and marinated pork).  It comes with tofu bean soup and fried rice.  This is the first place that cooks the kim chi and bean sprouts on the grill.  I don't care for this step.  The number of banchans that were served with our meal was scarce compared to other Korean bbq spots around time.    It was decent, but there are so many other better spots than HP."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! We were drawn to it from the smell outside and since it said Grand Opening we thought we would support them. Way too expensive for what it is. The food was not great either, I have had better. Very disappointing. Will not go there again."}
{"text":"They charged the tip without telling you. I was surprised by the check because they already put 15% tip inside it. I did not notice at first, I gave another 15%. They took it. Avoid this one. Liars."}
{"text":"First time coming here and service was good (but it was slow so I don't know how they do when it's busy) My 1 star is because the price wasn't worth what you get. The sides they had to offer were almost all just veggies. Really disappointing as many other Korean BBQ places had rice paper, steamed egg etc as their sides. The brisket was like  any other KBBQ place but their pork belly was good. 2 people will cost you $85 without dessert. I was so disappointed in this place I even skipped the ice cream macaroons."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised in many ways! The entire staff is so enthusiastic, witty, friendly, and informative. People more comfortable with manning their own grill without help might not like coming here because the staff is really hands on and present through the whole meal. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and clean. It looks and feels much more updated than the original location. My family and I shared a combo order rather than all you can eat and we were really pleased with what all was included and the selection. I had never seen my loud, talkative grandma to be so quiet because she was really chowing down. They throw the kimchi and beansprouts on the grill which may not be for everyone, but my family definitely liked it. It's really convenient not having to drive across town to get excellent KBBQ. We will be returning soon for more satisfying dinners."}
{"text":"Excellent traditional Korean BBQ hot pot. The food was fresh, our service was quick, prompt and polite! The music didn't blare out our conversation. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What makes this place so good is that you cook on a stone barbecue.  They may not have as many choices as some corporate Korean BBQ places, but the meat is of a better quality.  I will warn you, if you want to cook the meats yourself, like other Korean BBQ places, you will need to tell them in advance.  Otherwise, they will cook it for you.  That takes away half the fun of Korean BBQ in my opinion, but they were more than happy to let us cook it ourselves when we asked in advance.  Again I can't say enough about cooking on stone.  You can really taste the difference.  So come on everybody must get stone."}
{"text":"my sister and I are crazy fans of Korean culture ,we watch a lot of dramas so We wanted to experience the whole thing.When we got there our waitress was Korean actually and we could see the ajumas cooking.We decided to do the all you can eat special.The waitress explained to us what to eat first and the side dishes that goes with the different meets.The Kimchi was amazing,different from other places and the portions was very good too.I ask for a kimchi stew,that's not included in the all you can eat menu.It was really good ,delicious.All of the meets were fresh and top quality.The waitress cooked  everything for us in the grill.They have Korean beer and of course ,soju.We request Korean music and she was played for us.I definitely recomed the place.Its a little pricey but is worth it.We are coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with family and we were satisfied. The big plus here - they start cooking for you and the thingvhad holes so the oil gets drained, so each of the meat doesnt wnd up getting oily. and that's a very big plus. The meats were fresh, and the pork belly was very tasty, as well as the pork neck. The spicy pork was more sweet than spicy for my taste, but everyone else loved it. Their kimchi was good, and here they serve it hot. The AYCE was a tad pricy, and next time we will probably get the combo, which is a combination of meats. Nice to have this in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Early and often during the first year of our relationship, my girlfriend and I would frequent Honey Pig. She had never tried Korean BBQ, so \"Honey Pig!\" became our battlecry after long weeks or major life events to celebrate. As time passed (but the restaurant continued to celebrate its \"Grand Opening\"), the quality of service became schizophrenic and unpredictable. Asking for food became a chore and the cooking of food by staff felt unnecessary and burdensome. Staff routinely overcooked some items by not tending to the heat properly, and I began fighting for the tongs between rounds.  Our disappointment with Honey Pig climaxed around the holidays. With family in town, my girlfriend and I called ahead to reserve a table for a large group. The staff accepted our reservation and we showed up promptly for service. There was no table and the staff attempted to sit six full-grown adults at a table for four. It was obvious that the staff had just seated a group of six at a table intended for us. I objected to the four person table and we proceeded to wait thirty minutes for a second table. Despite the reservation and frequent visits (we're confident they recognized us), I was furious and that was the last time we ate at Honey Pig.  My biggest concern? I'm not entirely sure who is in charge here. Not once after nearly a dozen trips to Honey Pig has an owner or manager ever greeted us. That's unacceptable and such absent-ness is beginning to show. No one has ever asked about our meal. No one has ever asked for feedback. The staff is careless and unobservant (other than one or two persons) and I was so upset after that debacle around the holidays. I was so embarrassed for my family. With the abundance of great AYCE Korean BBQ alternatives in Las Vegas, I'm surprised this place has survived after how forgiving we were trip after trip after trip. No more."}
{"text":"Our first time and left very disappointed. Shocked they would serve dried Salmon and side dishes were limited. Service was poor even though it was almost empty. Better to make the drive elsewhere"}
{"text":"Came back to this place today with my husband and my father in law. 15 min later we've been told by 3 different ppl that \"it would take just a second\". No \"hi\" or any kind of mention to how long it would take to get us a table. other clients also left because they were waiting for too long. Too bad. We've been here 2 other times and had a blast. Food was great, but this time it seems like they did not have enough people working to take care of all the clients. I don't know if we will come back soon anymore. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were starving and had no idea where to eat so we drove around and we came upon Honey Pig. We were surprised and didn't know they opened up an AYCE near us.   Anyway, the place was nice overall. The table we sat at had oily seats. But no big deal! The service was not bad but I wouldn't say it was great either. They try to cook for you but then leave for a while then we tried to cook our meat because it started to get burnt then that's when the lady would come to the table. Majority of the reason why I'm only giving it 3 stars is because when it was time for a grill change they ended up putting lemon on the grill to take off the char. Uhh, if you don't want your meat tasting like lemon ask for a whole new grill!! After she \"cleaned\" off the char with lemon she continued cooking our meat. We couldn't finish the rest..the taste was off and not appetizing. Other than that, the place was decent. I'd go back but next time I'm saying NO to lemon lol. Just change the grill and give us new ones please! Come on! Just like all the other AYCE places!   So when it's time to change your grill, just ask for a new one :)   Oh and she didn't charge us extra for the meat we couldn't eat. So thank goodness!"}
{"text":"Their service was really terrible today. We sat there for a good 15 minutes and no one even came to our table. People came after us and and were served! It wasn't even that busy tonight, there was maybe 6 tables filled. I'm so sad because I really like their food. Maybe it was an off day, but still..the service was unacceptable."}
{"text":"AYCE Korean BBQ restaurants used to be confined to Spring Mountain, so it's nice to have one of them open up a place close to Henderson.  I actually live closer to our local location of Gen, but Honey Pig was more impressive when I tried their first Las Vegas location. I was excited to hear that they were coming to the fun part of Eastern Ave with so many other restaurants, and I went with friends to try it after work on Friday night. It's on the south side of the huge plaza, just across an alleyway from Big 5 Sporting Goods.  We were seated quickly, but despite the relative lack of customers, the server took a lot of time to start our grill and take our order. So yeah, there might still be kinks with the training or staffing level; fortunately, we weren't in a hurry. We wanted to do the all you can eat dinner ($24.95) after all, which means spending enough time to stuff yourself.  The cooking was about as attentive as I experienced before, with the meats started but not necessarily finished (so pull the meats yourself before they get overcooked). Still, it's better than some places which just bring the meats out and leave all the cooking to you. The meats were about as impressive as I recall at the original location, with pork belly being a standout and pork neck also impressive. The beef brisket was fine and the kalbi (beef short rib) was tender and delicious, but bulgogi (listed as marinated roast meat) wasn't special in the slightest. Also wasn't a fan of the spicy chicken \"boneless rib\" or the shrimp (which as we saw is prone to overcooking), but the spicy squid was nice for its texture.  As for the other actual food, the side salad was fresh and rather addictive, the kimchi was a little on the sweet side (alright for me, but not palatable at all to my tablemates), the bean sprouts were fine (and interestingly textured when overdone to a crisp), and the banchan were very different from the Spring Mountain location but still great. The eggplant was my favorite, the pickled daikon was also delicious, and the spicy beans and the tofu were good too. And servers were quite attentive with refilling the iced barley tea. I should note that only the salted sesame oil and the sweet dipping sauce were available (the original location had a paste that I don't recall using that often).  Despite not having as varied a menu as its competitors, this new location of Honey Pig is a delicious spot to stuff your stomach with meat. I'd probably go back for lunch if I could ($17.95 with only shrimp and beef short rib excluded as meats), but dinner would work as well. Oh, and it's certainly more nicely decorated and lit than the other Honey Pig."}
{"text":"Wow! We've been to their first location on Spring Mountain several times, and were happy our friend noticed they were having a soft opening tonight.  I've been to many study openings, and this was by far the best experience!   Staff was very friendly and stayed on top of the grill.  They even kept our iced teas filled! Meats were all really good as were the sides.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm going to start review by stating service deserves 4-5 stars but not the food.   First time at H P and will be my last. Its great to find KBBQ in Henderson and Gen is packed all the time! Visited H P because I didn't want to wait over an hour at Gen, wanted to stay close to home area in Henderson and Jun's is not AYCE lol.   I had to request AYCE menu, kind of like they were hiding it because the girl up front gave me the standard large menu. Price for AYCE $26.98.   - ordered large steamed eggs al la carte, around $10 - SKIP. Taste gross. Not even sure it was properly steamed.   - ran out of Japjay (spell check...clear stir fried noodles).   - restaurant offers warming kimchee on bbq grill, I wasn't a fan. Cold taste way better.   - bean sprouts didn't taste good.   - salad was okay.   After taxes + tip, meal wasn't worth $85 for 2 people. I will not return.   Gen at Galleria Mall is best AYCE KBBQ in Hendy."}
{"text":"While I loved the vegetarian mushroom option that Honey Pig offered, I was disappointed in the variety and quantity of banchan that was served along with our meal (my favorite part of Korean BBQ).   The vibe inside the restaurant is fun and the TVs were playing some old-school K-Pop which was interesting to watch/listen to. The employees were all very helpful and it was great that when they passed by, the servers would stop and help flip the meat and veggies that were currently on our grill. The table was round, but the space between the grill and the edge was pretty small making it difficult to maneuver -- especially is you were trying to pass any side dishes around, etc."}
{"text":"Great Korean BBQ.  Service was prompt at lunch.  They prepare and grill the food for you and all the traditional accompaniments are included with the meal.  We had the $29 beef combo which stated it was for two people but there was so much food it would have easily served 3-4."}
{"text":"Yay! Korean BBQ without having to fight Spring Mountain traffic! This Honey Pig is nice and clean! The hostess and servers are friendly. The food is pretty tasty. When I order a spicy dish super duper spicy, they actually comply. The best bang for your buck is going to be the AYCE, so save room in your tummy ahead of time. My only complaint is that they insist on cooking the food for you. I'm just not a fan of that. It interrupts the flow of conversation. Please give me the tongs and we will cook the meats the way we want to (rare, medium, or well done). Overall, one of the better Korean BBQ places."}
{"text":"Mine and Codys first visit, food was Great, service was very good and your taste buds will go crazy; had the beef player... amazingly delicious... we will be back!"}
{"text":"The meat quality is good, but unfortunately my favorite meat is Kalbi (short ribs), which with all you can eat they only let you order one order per person!  Which is only one slice!  Very disappointed.  If you're a Kalbi lover, I suggest you don't go here for AYCE."}
{"text":"To find a KBBQ place in Henderson was mind blowing when I first saw them build the restaurant, however; I'd recommend making the drive to Chinatown for something much better  Setting: situated in the busy parking lot with BJs, hot n juicy, brew tea bar, and taco y taco there are a lot of places to dine. Inside is decently spaced and well ventilated.  Service: props to the manager(Jihye)  for busting her ass while some of the other servers were just taking it easy.  Do yourself a huge favor and cut the weak links because it's destroying your flow.  Food: the quality of meats here are pretty bad. I think you can go to the Asian market and pick up better pork belly than the ones here. The grills don't filter out the fats and juices that well so it just cooks with the meat making it look steamed than caramelized. Also I've never seen carrots inside of bean paste soup and that's just not how it's prepared. Got the soon dae guk which tasted store bought.  Overall: A KBBQ place in Henderson especially in a busy plaza you'd think would do well but the quality of meat and lack of service other than from the manager makes me rather drive to Hobak and wait 2 hours there"}
{"text":"We love this place.  Food rocks.  Can't go wrong with the food.  Service is a little hit or miss."}
{"text":"This review is for a take out order. I ordered a bibimbap and a chicken ginseng soup to go. The bibimbap items were nearly placed in a piece of foil, with an over easy egg on top. A tiny bit of oily, settled bibimbap sauce was included. The amount of meat they put on this thing isn't even enough to satisfy my 2 year old son.  The chicken ginseng soup literally has a whole cornish hen in it, which is fine.. except that when you take it out of the soup container, you're left with about two shot glasses worth of soup.  The free banchan side dishes were probably the best part of this sorry meal.  Oh, and did I mention they didn't give any rice with the soup that clearly says \"includes rice\"? That's not a big deal, but did I also mention that they didn't give any freakin rice for the bibimbap (which IS a rice dish) for Christ sake?? What a sorry ass meal. I'll give you 2 stars because your sides are ok."}
{"text":"The food there was average ,but the Service was lacking.  The two middle aged Korean servers had an aloof attitude and they were completely inattentive to our dining needs.  It was our third time dining at this location, we live nearby in seven hills. One of the severs also spilled water on my mom's pants as she cleared the table. We are not the type of people who like to complain, but I think the place needs better management cuz service was horrible!  Overpriced for the competition on eastern ave in Henderson, this place won't last."}
{"text":"Well, my 9 year old daughter liked it. We ate at 1pm on a Thursday and we were the only customers. Good service. My wife and I love Korean BBQ, but we have to put this one at the bottom of the list. Everything was good......but just not great.  The restroom was awesome! Good location. I like the traditional iron cooking surface they use. I'd only come back if someone else paid."}
{"text":"Nice clean place. Memorial Day and there was no crowd...the bad... full price for the AYCE $27.00 bucks :(  The selection of banchan \"side dishes\" were ok and the taste was average. The star of this place was the pork belly and brisket. Try cooking the pork belly with the kimchi for that extra flavor. The ribeye portions are small and the meat was a little tough. Ordered the cold buck wheat noodles...the broth was luke warm...it should be cold and with ice for the authentic Korean experience...bbq some short ribs to eat with the cold noodles.   The staff was attentive and friendly...we were the only ones there...LOL ! We will be back for the lunch price during the week day and it's located in Henderson...no more long drive out to Spring Mountain area! !"}
{"text":"I ordered to go from honey pig through UberEATS. I was really craving some spicy pork and my husband was craving some bulgogi but there isn't anywhere around us that does a small portion option so we had settled on just seeing what UberEATS had in the area. Lo and behold they had a Korean place. I ordered 2 bento boxes. 1 spicy Pork for me and 1 bulgogi for my husband. I was excited because the bento boxes seemed liked the perfect solution. I can't really rate the service since it was through UberEATS but the food was decent. They were delivered in nice disposable bento boxes which I liked. It kept everything from blending. It was also nice portion sizes. I often don't like AYCE because I don't end up ordering enough to make it worth it.The bento included: meat option, fried dumpling, miso soup, rice and table sides. Both spicy pork and bulgogi were pretty good. Both of our fried dumplings, 4 in totally were completely burned, I don't mean like slightly past golden either. I also wasn't a fan of the kimchi it was more just pickled cucumbers. Would I order a bento for delivery again? Probably in the same situation where I'm lazy and don't want to cook."}
{"text":"First time at Honey Pig and was very impressed. The food tasted great - I really recommend the Seasoned Sirloin.   Service was very accommodating and friendly as well. The Manager, Jina brought our food fairly fast and gave her best recommendations which was nice. I liked how she explained which sides were what and how it's best to eat them. I feel a lot of the KBBQ places I've gone to kinda just give you the meat and leave.  Place was also very clean.  I just wish steamed egg was available for everyone but I'd definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Honey Pig is the best Korean BBQ restaurant I have ever been to. Their all you can eat menu is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Finally we have Korean BBQ restaurant in henderson! Yes there are some other ones in henderson area but they are more fusion  style not real Korean I would say. We used to go to the honey pig  on  spring mountain location but it was pretty far. Daechang( grilled beef  intestant)is to die for!   Great quality of meat and side dishes. Friendly staffs and   very nice atmosphere with fun environment. Defiantly  check  this out!!"}
{"text":"It was an okay next to the bigger types like GEN kbbq, a little more pricy than i would have liked, not very many selections on the all you can eat menu and serves was slow. but the food was tasty and portion sizes were appropriate and if you like the fact they help cook your food a little here and there then you would enjoy it."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try again after my first delivered order and went here last night with my daughter and had our food cooked  at our table. The Bulgogi was very tasty as well as the Jap Che. I wasn't thrilled with the very limited sides offered like other Korean BBQ places and I didn't like my Kimchi being thrown onto the grill either. Other than that I think this is a welcome addition to Henderson versus the drive to China town and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Kimchi soup is very good flavorful the way I would make it with more of the beef flavor than seafood. Macaroni salad is delish however sweet. They put a lot of salt and sugar in almost if not everything so beware this is not a healthy spot by any means! I hope they offer some vegan or healthier options for the more health conscious even though the name of it is Honey Pig! I'm glad there'a a go to for my kimchi soup cravings"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Had lunch here with my siblings, sad that we missed the lunch time because the dinner price tag was $26.95 per person for AYCE which kinda makes me hesitant because of the hefty price tag but I honestly think it's worth it.  We were greeted by the manager Jina and she seated us quickly, and explained how the AYCE worked. We ordered Teriyaki Chicken, a whole bunch of Beef Brisket, Marinated Roast Meat (it taste like beef bulgogi), Seasoned Beef Sirloin, Pork Neck, Beef Rib Eye and Beef Short Rib. The meat we ordered came quickly and all the meat served was high quality compared to GEN which is kinda hit or miss.  The service was really good. Our server, is also the manager always dropped by if we have any questions or if we would like to order more meat.   The only real concern I had was the table is on the small side. We couldn't fit everything on the table.  Overall, great service and great food."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Less than impressed. We ordered our first selections of meat, kimchi and water. She server brought out kimchi and beansprouts and plopped them onto the grill. We told her we didn't want the kimchi warm and to just cut it and put it on the table. She seemed put out by that. They also charge for steamed eggs, which come included on the AYCE menu at most of the bbq's we go to in town.   We had to ask for water 3x before she brought us some. We actually prefer cooking it ourselves but she kept plopping plates of meat on the grill,eventually we gave up the fight and just let her do it. For the price and the quality, I'd much rather go to Doh near our house or Lee's in koreatown. Ribeye was touch and chewy and and was edible once dipped into the nacho cheese warmed up on the grill."}
{"text":"Love having an authentic Korean BBQ place in Henderson.  Here is what I like and don't like about Honey Pig...  What I like: 1. They do have an AYCE eat menu with about 10 different most popular meats you can order. There is a limit to the Kalbi, Bulgogi, so that is a bit of a shame.  2.  The quality of meat is good, not overly marinated so all of you that are used to really flavored and marinated cuts of meat please be aware.  3.  Cooking - The attendants will come by frequently to make sure that you have everything well cooked and pushed to side when it is cooked.  4.  The Kim Chi - Love that they lop all this in huge heaps right on the actual cooktop.  I never had heated Kim Chi before and it is good.  5.  Staff and Service - Very nice and friendly overall.  Place is busy, we went on a Tuesday night and it was packed and mostly with what seemed to be Korean families, so they must know where to go...  6.  Private rooms - They have two tables in a semi private area that can seat about 10 on each table, or about 20 altogether.  Not bad for a small party.  7.  Bang for the buck - AYCE is 24.95.  I think it is overall a good deal. Just order properly so that the food comes out at the right time.  What I think can improve: 1. For the AYCE, a limit of one order of the Kalbi and Bulgogi is a bit unfortunate and it is actually, one strip for each.  Normally, an order is larger than one strip.  2.  Busy - Whey they are busy, the service is slow and the meat during the AYCE comes out fairly slow.  They also \"forget\" to bring out some of the meats like the Kalbi.  Slow service at an AYCE place is sort of like buying a Ferrari and driving at 15 mph.  Let's face it, you are gonna get full and order less.  3.  Service - Asking for things when they are busy is tough. They won't look at you or look your way, so you have to be quite intentional and speak up, interrupt, be noticeable or chase them down to get what you want.   It is hard to compare this to somewhere like Gen at the mall.  Gen is a systemized franchise place that is similar but marketed and designed for the suburban tastes in decor and service.  Most people will prefer Gen, its service, menu, choices.  I am not even sure if there is a limit.  Honey Pig is also a franchise but it seems to market itself as mom and pop.  The decor is much more Korean in style and it portrays to be a small business.  For authentic Korean BBQ, I do like Honey Pig, but I am not totally sold on the bang for the buck over Gen.  I will be coming back to test it out.   Good enough for 3.5 stars.  I will be back to try their normal food as that does look pretty good.  Not sure if I am ready to bring friends here on a regular basis.  By the way, it can be busy so if it is important, make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Korean meals don't always have to be BBQ, and they offered a small section on menu dedicated to regular korean dishes. Good prices and good selection. The kimchi was tasty and fresh which usually means the rest of the food will be good. Pleased to say the korean food here is good. The service was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Good service and food is good but such a small portion for the 2 of us. Can't compare to the LA honey pig. It seems like the combo for 2 is the half of the size of the combo in LA. More meat please! Otherwise yum."}
{"text":"What a gastronomic experience. Delicious food and excellent service! I love Korean BBQ and so happy to have one close to home now.   I highly recommend this place and I witnessed \"The Jose\" having dinner."}
{"text":"This place is totally under the radar! I had a positive experience here and wouldn't mind coming here instead of Gen! *gasp* The big difference at Honey Pig, is that they cook it for you!!! You will end up smelling like BBQ when you leave though. Went with the AYCE option. They also do not charge for little kids (4 and under...I think). The quality of meats here were good, but not as good as some of the places on Spring mtn.  The usually banchan was good, but why do they put the kimchi on the grill? I like my kimchi cold!  The noodle dish that I usually look forward too, jap chae, was unavailable or not included in the AYCE. What a bummer.  The servers were attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good, my first time trying Korean BBQ and wow! It did not disappoint, I have to say I am hooked. I can only hope there will be good Korean bbq back home in Texas that is just as good! My favorite was the short ribs!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a different approach to Korean BBQ, the servers are actually assisting with the cooking making sure that everything is done right, as well as making sure you have what you needed. The meat selections are alright, not as extensive as what other Korean BBQs I've been to. Cooking the kimchi is a new experience for us, but I like it! Spent about $100 for 3 but that also included 2 bottles of Sapporo, it's a bit pricey, though most Korean BBQs are. It's a good overall experience as we came out very full."}
{"text":"A step up from the location on Spring Mountain.  Environment: When I used to live on the other side of town I used to go to the location of Honey Pig at Spring Mountain all the time. That location is open 24 hours and was perfect for a late-night craving of Korean BBQ. However, now that I live in Henderson, I rarely get around to that side of town much anymore, which makes it perfect that there is a new location of Honey Pig located on Eastern in Henderson now as well. The interior is obviously nicer and newer than the other location and offers a variety of seating from booths to tables to more private areas  Food: I rarely ever get All you can eat at Honey Pig and I usually opt for a set. The set comes with meat, fried rice, salad, soup, etc. and I am usually too full to finish everything which brings the cost to lower than that of all you can eat but I always still leave satisfied. Additionally, the set comes with a drink which is perfect since I always get beer and soju here anyway. There a variety of sets to choose from which have various meats and are designed to serve various numbers of customers, so they would be perfect to split between 2 people or for bigger groups around 5 to 6.  Service: Service is consistent here as well. The workers are sure to check up on you as well as get you any additional sides that you may need. Another point that I like about this restaurant is that the servers all make sure to help you cook and cut the meat, ever if they are not necessarily assigned to your section in the restaurant which I think is nice because sometimes you may be busy talking with your friends or drinking to even notice that it is the appropriate time to flip the meat or that it is ready to eat.  Overall, Honey Pig is a nice reliable place to get Korean BBQ in Henderson, and it is a nice addition to the otherwise lacking roster of Korean restaurants in this part of town!"}
{"text":"Trying something new! This place was great. Split combo letter A. Sooo much awesome food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Sadness.  Been to the one on spring mountain and I don't remember it being so pricey and having a limit on the meats you can order for all you can eat.  All the good meats you can only have 1 per order.  Only the cheaper cuts is all you can eat.  Sad.  For a family of four it was almost $200.   Disappointing"}
{"text":"Went there last Saturday and it was excellent. Great food and wonderful service. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed. I am from LA. I'm very spoiled by K-Town. But we always give all KBBQ places a chance. The service was fantastic. They work so hard. I hope they get paid fair wages and keep their tips. We didn't like the meat selection and it's quality. The ban chan selection was poor. They didn't have rice paper or radish or lettuce leaves. A place like this would be $7.99 for lunch with what they offer. So the prices are too high for what you get. I never like chains and I know Honey Pig is one, but if you're going to go to a chain, go to @Gen KBBQ"}
{"text":"I usually come here with my buddies for AYCE. We always have left full, satisfied, and in our wake, a restaurant booking numbers in the red.  The AYCE menu is short, but sweet with some meats that we'll order multiple times during a visit. Our favorites are the ribeye (we'll each order a steak), brisket, and the short rib. We've never questioned the quality and the open kitchen allows us to see our meat being sliced. Don't forgot to place your meat in a lettuce wrap and add some jalapeno and garlic to give that crunch and extra boost of flavor. Yes, they do cook the kimchi and the bean sprouts on the grill, but the beautiful thing a about Korean BBQ is that if that's not your preference, you're free to pull it off the grill anytime you want.  The grills are large and ceramic which means that you can fit more food on your grill and that it does not need to be changed frequently. The down side is the grill does not reach the high temperatures of a metal grill and you won't get that hard sear on the meat. The ventilation is also not the best and all my wife has to do is get a whiff when I get home and there won't be any questions of where I've been.  Even though we work them over, the servers have always taken care of us. They'll cook for us when they're not busy and will always keep up with our orders to make sure we can eat continuously and don't have an empty bottle of Soju or Cass in front of us. Props to them for telling us not to order certain items such as the special kimchi which we may not find appetizing, and also always offering to finish our meal with rice on the grill.  When I'm with the family and not hogging out, their dinner sets will do the trick and provide plenty of variety and food. Although a different atmosphere and less selection, I'd put Honey Pig on the same rung as the other Korean BBQ in Henderson and gives us a viable option depending on what we're in the mood for."}
{"text":"OMG! This place was awesome! From the time we walked in until we were done, their customer service was great! Their was so much food! After eating all the meat and side dishes, they make fried rice and brought us soybean paste soup and steamed eggs! Now that was a surprise! It was so delicious! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We got there before the dinner rush, so service was pretty swift and we got our food onto the grill really fast. Our server Nikki was friendly and on top of things for the most part.   Instead of the combo sets, the 3 of us decided to go with the $26.99 AYCE since there was a lot of protein items we wanted to try. 14 items total, including spicy shrimp and spicy squid!  Orig we wanted to go with the $50 beef combo (galbi, brisket and bulgogi for 2-3 people) plus an aka carte order of pork belly ($26), but decided that the AYCE option was way better because we could try out more meats for the same price.  We pigged out on marinated galbi, beef brisket, pork belly and spicy squid.  Everything was delicious and seasoned really well. We were especially pleasantly surprised that the spicy squid was actually a whole giant squid, tentacles and all! So tender and meaty, if I wasn't so full I'd another a second serving of squid...  They offered to cook fried rice on your grill after your meal, using your leftover meats and kimchi. It's included with the price of your meal, but we declined since we were stuffed.   My friend got a couple of green tea ice cream macaroons for dessert ($3.50 each). He ate both, lol.  Overall a tasty experience. A great new addition to Henderson!"}
{"text":"We used to go there a lot (the first one in Vegas on spring mountain) however it got too oily. This time we tried the new one on eastern, food is still food by the portion seems smaller. We ordered two combo but it felt like one or one and a half. Staff are very nice tho."}
{"text":"1. Unfriendly staff except for that other girl (server) who smiles a lot in front of the customers. She's not korean, I think she's more likely filipina/hawaiian. I like her, she's friendly.  2. . Not impressed with the service. Servers tryna help you cook lol personally I don't like it. It's like invading privacy and they don't even ask permission and also it makes it AWKWARD for customers while the servers are in front of you cooking and then they just leave and then come back again~cook and then leave.   3. Servers asks you for drinks, right? So we ordered soda and water but it didn't came unless you ask for it.   4. We ordered soup but it didn't came as well LOL unless you ask for it AGAIN.   Location is okay. A bit pricey. Food is okay, I rather drive 10 more miles than to eat here. Haha! We just tried it cos we live like few blocks from this restau.   Again, for servers. Please try to be more friendly. You guys are the frontrow, you carry the restaurant :)"}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to go for lunch and was craving Korean bbq. And I stumbled upon this place!! Yay! This is now my favorite Korean bbq place to go to! Clean, good vibes, and friendly service. Parking is not bad and the location is easy to find. I'd rather go here than other Korean bbq places up in spring mountain. Food is yummy, and I'm a fan of their bulgogi (thin beef slices marinated). The tea is pretty good too! Check this place out. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Never again.   Used to love to come here with local friends for the AYCE option. Quality was about average compared to other AYCE, but very convenient being in Silverado Ranch area.   Was very disappointed to find out that they pulled their AYCE menu. Combo options have the same quality food at about 2-3x the price. A la carte options are good, but not worth the price.   I'll head to Doh on Rainbow/Windmill for my fix now - way better food and well worth the extra drive."}
{"text":"Can I just please say so much yum!! Give me more of this stuff!!! I love where I live. So close to so many good food places... Eastern is a prime location for food. First time goes to Honey Pig Bbq. Korean BBQ has to be one of my most favorite styles of cooking/food to eat.  We walked in and got greeted promptly. There was 3 of us and a toddler. They sat us in the corner which was a good spot when you have a gremlin with you. We got situated and they brought over a high chair. Scanned the menu and I am a firm believer of stick to what you know... I'm not the adventurous eater type unless it's free! I mean that makes sense right?? So back to menu browsing.. bulgogi and short ribs are my go to! Short ribs ran for about $34.99 and bulgogi ran for $29.99 a little bit on the pricier side BUT wow was their quality of meat so delicious!! I am not regretful what so ever. We also ordered a bottle of Pinot noir with our meal. They brought all the normal sides including kimchi my favorite and a big bowl of salad for the table. So great they provided this for us. Everything tasted so great and I think I found my new Korean BBQ spot especially since it's literally a 3 mins drive away !"}
{"text":"Excellent service, very attentive.  Good choices and a variety of meats.  Clean restaurant and quiant ambiance."}
{"text":"This is their new location, looks clean overall compare to the one in Chinatown. Their style may be different than most of Korean bbq places you've been. Server will come cook and cut meat for you and at the end they will bring rice to make fried rice when you're already stuffed with all the meat so if you want your rice to eat with meat in the beginning, you'll have to ask them to bring it first.   The bulgogi is really sweet for my taste, the spicy chicken - said my Brazilians  \"its really spicy!\". Well I'm Thai and Koran spicy is like our dessert lol. My fav is the brisket, dip in bean paste and grilled garlic+jalapeño!  3 star because their price and the quality of meat for a la cart."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch on Tuesday around 11:30am. Located in the busy shopping mall with BJ's and Twin Peaks on Eastern. Wasn't too busy, only 3 other tables occupied. Very nicely decorated place, with several tables all with cooking grills and ventilation.   Perusing the menu, prices were a bit high for my liking. The AYCE options for lunch were a bit confusing. I wasn't exactly sure what I was going to get. I decided to instead go with a lunch box Kalbi, for $14.99, which ended up being plenty of food.  Everything was tasty and cooked right. No complaints for the food and quality. Service was quick and attentive. I did watch her help out some KBBQ rookies and all seemed good there.  Overall, its good KBBQ that is a little bit pricy."}
{"text":"Been to this location a few time already and have not had a bad experience ever. The food and service is great I would highly recommend this place for AYCE Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"The quality of the food was very good and I was very satisfied with the customer service where they constantly came to our table and grilled our food for us. Sarah the host was very welcoming and kind. It was THE BEST restaurant I have been to in awhile"}
{"text":"this place's service is getting worse every time we visit. you need to order everything i mean even the basic salad, banchans, and rice or they will not bring it out to you. you will just be eating meat, literally just meat. they will not come unless you ring the bell. no refilling drinks. steamed egg is extra charge apparently...$11 for steamed egg which took forever to cook. the place was virtually empty so imagine if they ever get busy...good luck getting anything."}
{"text":"Great Value!  Just recently a family member and I went to eat at Honey Pig and I was informed that they got rid of their all you can eat menu.  Initially, I was irritated but decided to stay. I am so glad I did. For a 2-3 ppl Beef Combo (which includes brisket, sirloin, marinated meet, and fried rice along with the side dishes) it only cost $30. You are allowed to take your leftovers home too.   The all you can eat was about $25 per person and you can't take home your leftovers.   The food was delicious as always and the servers were nice and there when we needed them."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered from them, they forgot the kimchi. I was willing to overlook that, as the food was pretty good. Tonight I ordered from them and got raw chicken. Never again. I'm beyond disgusted."}
