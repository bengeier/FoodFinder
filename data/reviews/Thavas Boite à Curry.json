{"text":"Fantastic fast casual food! Great service. This place needs to be a franchise. Delicious Sri Lankan dishes. Bring this to US!"}
{"text":"We ordered kothu roti and masala dosa. The kothu roti was awesome with fresh curry leaves and goat meat (you can order any meat you like). Masala dosa came with sambhar and coconut chutni. The stuffing in the dosa was very filling and perfect. Dosa was made in butter giving it a rich aroma and flavor. All in all I dint expect it to be this good. A good discover :)"}
{"text":"Seems like a cool restaurant as its really well decorated, clean and new. Went in there to give it a try. 
Didn't really know what to order since they didn't have any pictures on the menu so I got the special of the day with beef. The cashier said its a Indian specialty. 
The dinner special came with a soup, a main dish and a drink. I got the coconut water, it costed about $15. 
It was quite in the restaurant which I really liked. The food was also good, I request to make my dish spicy, and it really got the kick to it :D
What I also really like about this restaurant was they make everything to order so everything is fresh. I was hoping for more veggie in my dish as my meal turned out to be like a fried rice dish. Also, I wish they had more picture to show me as I didn't know what to expect. 
It was a fun adventure though."}
{"text":"This is a very cool place to come for some authentic south Asian food. Everyday they have three lunch specials which includes a soup, a soft drink and a main dish that ranges from biryanis to dosas to curries. I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"For my 100th review, I knew I had to write about a real stand out meal. Ironically, I was the only diner on this particular evening, as it was at about closing time. The owner even came to clear my completely cleaned plates, as I went to wash my curried hands apr√®s meal. You see I'd used my hands to eat much of the meal (very glad I was alone, in my private dining area).

About a week or so before I had stumbled upon this new, colourful and uniquely decored one off location. It's set among a few other new restaurants in a new construction south of Ste. Catherine St. Out of all the choices including a place that specializes in rich hot chocolate, I dreamt of this place. It's actually Sri Lankan cuisine, which would be my first delectable try. 
 
Before I start to salivate recalling my mouthwatering finger licking meal, here's what I ate/devoured. It was Tandoori chicken in a brilliant red curry paste sauce. With perfectly crisp red onions, green and red pepper, and sliced carrots. Not like any carrots I've ever had before, in the best way. The same can be said about the house prepared curry paste. Not like any I've ever tasted. Thus, why I dug in fingers first, and used every square inch of napkin. I knew I'd be over stuffed, but managed to eat almost all of the accompanying rotis (a type of moist flatbread). Believe it or not I had already eaten a bowl of their succulent cauliflower puree soup to start. I used a large can of young coconut water to wash down the just-right amount of heat and zing. 

With my sinuses cleared I perused the pristinely clean restaurant and studied the mosaicked tiles and coloured baskets on the wall. I was too full to move, but we all had had a long day of cooking and eating, so as I said in the first paragraph, I washed my curried hands and was thankful for such a special experience, right in the city, but very far from the country of origin.

Note: They have 4 or so chalkboard specials daily. In that case I'll twist my own rubber arm."}
{"text":"This is a new place... A \"fast food\" indian restaurant. Still a little slow and needs minor improvements here and there. However, the food is quite good... Comparable to what you get in a good indian restaurants (and better than some). It is very fresh and very tasty. The soups and basmati are very well done. The curries are excellent and not too greasy. The nan is just ok.

The masala dosa is truly exceptional and the main reason why this place truly deserves 5 stars. It is so tasty snd complex. The texture and spice level of the crepe are perfect... Can't wait to have it again! 


The cashier is efficient and very knowledgable of the menu. Staff is friendly. Prices are very reasonable. 

Decor is very nice. A tiny place to escape the hectic downtown streets.  

All in all: great place for lunch and maybe even for a casual supper."}
