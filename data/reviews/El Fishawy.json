{"text":"OMG. Where do I start!!!
We originally came to the Mississauga area to visit Jasmine, it was about 10:30 on a Wednesday night. When we found Jasmine, it was closed! what the?!?!?!

Since we were from the US, we stopped by the Pizza Pizza and used the wifi to find another hookah spot. We saw El Fishawy, and started driving.
When we reached there, we thought maybe it was closed, the lights were slightly dimmed, and the windows have a fogged design. We decided to just go for it. When we entered. It was one of the nicest hookah bars I have seen! Most hookah bars are ugly with dollar-items and cheap furniture scattered across the wide open space. But this had booths and nice tables and cute little trinkets sitting around on the ledges.
Service was superb. The second you raised your hand, the servers came running. The fries were good. And the hookah lasted a long time. I'm definitely coming back here when I'm back in the Toronto area.
I hope this place succeeds and lasts a long time! It was an amazing experience. 
The hookah was SO ridiculously cheap. I think it was like $9?"}
{"text":"I have been going to El Fishawy since over a year now and it is my favourite shisha place in Mississauga! The staff is friendly and fast. The atmosphere, decor and music are great. The prices are amazing as well. I have nothing bad to say about this place. The only minor thing is that they do not have a big variety of flavours and it also gets pretty busy on friday and saturday nights. 

I would definitely recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for sheesha.  The staff are attentive, the place is reminiscent of a cafe in egypt.  Full of interesting characters, from young high school students to older arab immigrants, all getting their fix.  I always order double apple and have never got a bad sheesha.  Tobacco is fresh, lasts long, and the pipe is clean.  Turkish coffee is great.  I haven't really tried the food, so can't comment on it.  Highly recommend this place for sheesha though."}
{"text":"This place can be great for an evening out with your friends or out of town relatives. Not only because it is lively and comfortable for large crowds also because it has a good menu especially the fries and the Turkish coffee or tea is the worlds best. This is not a bias opinion but that's what I know and what people who drink coffee know. Fortunately Seattle comes in second. I just go there to chill to enjoy the coffee."}
{"text":"Its an average place to chill with friends when you plenty of time. 

Service - This service is quite slow but that's usual in and Arabic restaurant and you have to go pay at the back. 

Hookah/ Shisha - are decent but get better if you are chilling with friends. They do have quite a bit number of flavors

Food - very basic priced reasonable and you can feel that in the quality. I have tried their mixed plate, shawarama wrap, tea and they only have bottled water.

washrooms - are in an ok condition

Restaurant - is cramped up with table and chairs to accommodate more and more people and the place is full of Shisha smoke so be prepared for that. 

Average Shisha place to chill with some friends."}
{"text":"I'm not a shisha doer, but my friends are and they loved their experience. As a non-shisha person, I enjoyed my overall experience. Excellent service, comfortable environment, clean washrooms, quality coffees and great desserts. Worth your while!"}
{"text":"Decent food and hookah. The staff is generally all friendly except for the owner/manager or whoever the big old dude that sits in the back is... he just sits there all night smoking and looks grumpy."}
{"text":"Went in early Saturday evening with a friend. We had a very good time. Sheesha was $8.99. Food was delicious and very well priced. Most of their entress were under $10. I got the mixed grilled plate which came with chicken shwarma, kebab and lamb with a hugeee pile of battered fries and well dressed salad for $13.99. The decor is nice and the waiters are friendly. Very good place overall."}
{"text":"Middle eastern atmosphere like nowhere else. Very authentic hookah joint - spacious, bustling like a public bazaar, full of characters, and very poorly ventilated. Better than Alladin's in my opinion. 

I didnt get any food, just turkish coffee and baklava. The coffee was decent, but baklava could definitely be improved upon. I haven't heard great things about food service, but I could be wrong. Hookah, 2 turkish coffees, baklava, and tip came to about $20 - very reasonable.

When I came on a Saturday night. the place was packed and service was a little slower.. but it's very understandable for the number of people they are serving. 

All in all, I had a good time playing cards and catching up with friends. I'll be back for more hookah-ing in 'sauga."}
{"text":"Can someone tell me um am 18 and just wanna know if they serve 18yr olds with sheesha or do you have to be 19 pm me thx"}
{"text":"Why I go here sometimes?
-Nearby 

What about the service? 
Hit and miss / the owner is the only one smiling , the servers are cocky and still expect tips.

Hookah? 

Is good but no blue mist (for the true hookah peeps out there)."}
{"text":"the service fucken sucks, the staff do not respect customers!!! they have high egos, treat customers like shit, for example, i politely called over one of the staff members he ignored me for like 20 mins, then i called another he ended up giving me a dirty look and took my order,  im pretty disappoint with my experience here. wouldn't go back...."}
{"text":"Went here for some Sheesha tonight.  Definitely has an arab bazaar feeling here. Pretty spacious place with very good hookah at very good prices!  This is real tobacco sheesha, unlike other places.  Tried the lemon with mint which was pretty good. I also had a hot chocolate which was good.  They also serve food, which I did not try, but I am told it is halal. Fast service."}
{"text":"Service is fine, food is nice. Can't complain about the price.

It does get very busy there, so the place is incredibly packed. Sometimes dangerously so (in my opinion).

The only gripe I have is the music. It is so loud sometimes that it's annoyingly difficult to have a conversation."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times before but I am going to talk about my most recent visit. Went here with some friends for some food and hookah. We decided to get the grape mint, which was a great choose for hookah as it wasn't too strong of a flavour. The food on the other hand wasn't that great , we all got falafel and they were really dry. Pretty much they tasted like saw dust. Also one of my friends was vegan and we told them 3 times that we they could have any dairy products and twice they brought out the falafel's with cream sauce on it. 

Come for the hookah, but eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"***Review is based on food/service, not hookah.***

First impression?  The night before my visit, I called to see if they had free wifi.  Gent who answered the phone was very abrupt and rude, but he did give me a reply.  YES, this place does have free wifi which is a bonus!

Atmosphere:  On either side of the hookah bar, there are couches.  Since I came here with a coupla clients, we wanted to sit on the couches.  However, almost immediately, we were asked to move to the tables in the centre.  The couches are supposed to be \"reserved\" for larger groups...although we didn't see any signs.

It is smoky, but full of hookah smoke, so don't worry you won't come out of El Fishawy smelling like conventional smoke.

Food-wise:  Sorry to shatter all those who said that the food is good, but I ordered the Mixed Shawarma Platter ($8.99 with fries/salad) and both the chicken/beef stripes had a spongey texture, re:  the meat was previously frozen.  The food arrived relatively quickly which also tipped me off.

Food tasted fine, but the price sorta matches the quality.

We also asked for water, but only bottled water was provided.  We asked for tap water, but we were told that they only serve bottled water ($$$).  :S

On a Wednesday evening, this place was quite busy.  I noticed though that I was one of the couple of women who were there.  (The other female was my client.)  It was predominantly male which can be a bit intimidating.

Like the other reviewers mentioned, the service is really the downfall of El Fishawy.  The older man, the one who I suspect answered the phone, behind the counter is very rude.  I'm not sure if this is a cultural thing, but I was looking for the washroom, and he grunted and me, telling me it was to the left.

The younger guy who served our table was alright, but again, not serving tap water??  That's a bit ridiculous."}
{"text":"owner is a dick. I was there with a couple of friends, pretty spacious and a good hookah. Me and my friends wanted to head home, we struck up a conversation with a regular at the hookah bar, before he left he asked for some tobacco and they sold it to him and he left. 30 minutes later when me and my friends wanted to leave we asked for the same thing only for the server to tell us they dont sell tobacco, I ask him to bring the manager and he brings the owner who spends 5 minutes berating me and my friends going as far as calling us liars. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I stick to my original review...still the same place with good service and still just as busy...if not more.

I had ordered the fries with my hookah...I wanted ketchup with hot sauce as well with the fries. To my surprise when the fries came, they were already battered in hot sauce. I guess this is something new, never experienced this before. I guess you have to specify the hot sauce 'on the side'. 

Otherwise...still great times!!"}
{"text":"This used to be THE SPOT back 8 or 9 years ago, when it was the only happening spot for good hookahs and nice quality time.
Things have changed since, with numerous other options in the area, El Fishawy has lost a big chunk of customers, due to many reasons.
Hookahs were always great, nice flavours, cheap prices, and the atmosphere is nice.
However, the place is full of smoke, and you would need some serious dry-cleaning afterwards.
Customer service here was always a hit and miss, depends who you get, too many little kids and there were a couple of professional girls.
The owner has zero customer service skills and will not tolerate his own-self, that's probably who many of the negative reviews here referring to as a rude person.

I wouldn't say their food is good, but it wasn't bad either..it's kinda okay to grab a bite if you're starving until you go elsewhere and have a real meal..."}
