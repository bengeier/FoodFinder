{"text":"Really good food, comedy shows go on upstairs, good drink prices and selection, nice outdoor patio bar"}
{"text":"This is a great place with an awesome patio with affordable delicious food and drinks.  We will definitely will be back to this hidden gem in battery park.  It is kid friendly, bike friendly and dog friendly. Great service. Love it."}
{"text":"On Saturday we went to the Reddstone (1261 W. 76 St.) for a quick lunch.

  There's a lot to say about this place. The french fries come topped with delicious rosemary and taste like they're fried in duck fat.

    The biggest item of conversation was the orange soup. It was a cold, creamy, spicy orange soup with onions and nuts. I didn't like it, but my foodie friend did.

    The price was expensive but the food and service and atmosphere were well worth it. The service was only OK.

     I have pictures of the soup, the burger and the lovely patio on my blog (http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/06/reddstone-restaurant-cleveland-battery.html) as well as a link to their full menu."}
{"text":"Great food great service! If you're in the area you definitely need to come here. If you don't you are missing out! When here ask for Erin she is a phenomenal bartender and server!!!!!"}
{"text":"The outdoor atmosphere is definitely urban chic, reminding me of the phenomenal Piccolo Sogno in the River West enclave of Chicago. First rate service and attentiveness from the awesome female staff and caring managers made for a wonderful experience, especially when accompanied by the very flavorful menu of appetizers and entrees. Not only was the food delicious, but the presentation was worthy of Master Chef consideration. From burgers stacked five inches high with culinary treats, to a seafood trilogy of crab, shrimp and scallop morselites, the Reddstone chef has the necessary visual and flavor flair to be a Gordon Park - Battery Park all-star.
And I didn't even mention the beer selection, which had my fave - Willoughby Brewing Co.'s Gutterpup Porter. An intriguing selection of micro-brews will satiate any beer lover's palate. I hope you too can enjoy a summer evening in the West Side's \"newest oldest\" eatery."}
{"text":"The burgers are very good.  Fries kind of greasy.  Service was good. I really like the patio."}
{"text":"Omg! Me and my girlfriend was here a few nights ago we had there chicken philly and meatloaf sandwich it was amazing ! service was great and so was the drinks there patio is beautiful we can't wait to enjoy the summer out there i will be back"}
{"text":"*****EXCELLENT******
Reddstone is under NEW management , with all NEW staff and it is awesome!
We sat on the patio and had great service and delicious food and cocktails.
I would recommend the tacos or the house flatbread!! yum yum
The cocktails are unique and tasty -- a personal fave is the \"my darling clementine\"
definetly a NEW and IMPROVED Reddstone :)"}
{"text":"Great burger + beer deal on Wednesday but you may be abandoned on the patio... hello... may I get another beer... hi... is there someone I could pay? Hello?"}
{"text":"Sad. Disappointing. This \"was\" a great place but no more. Ate there last weekend.  Of the 4 drink specials on their permanent menu they only had ingredients to make one. My wasabi wings were tasteless. Salmon pasta was decent but that was a special of the day. Menu is much smaller than previous owner. All small plates, flat plates and burgers; no full meals.  Owner sat at end of bar texting all night but did check on us once. Patio might still be nice but we will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food: I had the nola burger with fries (10 bucks). It was all really good. The only negative is that the burger is one of those \"taller the better\" deals, where unless your jaw hinges like a snake, you won't get from top to bottom in one bite. 

Drink: Average beer selection including several micro's. 

Service: Nice guys

Atmosphere: small neighborhood pub feel. nothing fancy. 

Overall: Great food with average prices and good service. Don't let the outside of the building keep you away, definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Fantastic patio and wings. Tuesday they offer 15 cent wing nights. Only drawback is the inside isn't as nice."}
{"text":"A group of about 20 of us met here on a Thursday night around 7pm to catch a college basketball game -- our alma mater (Dayton) was playing in the finals of the NIT. They were a little caught off guard. Granted, it was a weeknight, but they were a little understaffed. I literally waited 10 minutes for my first beer and wisely ordered two. Our group drank them out of cold Bud Light and Miller Light and for about an hour, all we had to choose from was Coors Light and Mich Ultra. One of the best bar patios I've seen in Cleveland. And great taco night. But on this night, their service wasn't up to snuff."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Reddstone. I really did. It's walking distance from my house...so convenient.

But the service is so consistently poor with bartenders being inattentive, food orders going missing/wrong, long delays that it is difficult to say much good. Then there's the time the server accidentally charged my buddy's debit card $8,867 instead of $88.67.  And the time the frier went on the fritz during a private party and all of us upstairs all ended up having to take our coats to the drycleaner to get the smell of wings off them.

Food is average at best. 

 Patio is nice.....stick to drinks.  

Want a much better bar in the same neighborhood....go to the Parkview."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great place.  We had always heard such great things about Reddstone.  We live waaayyyy out in Lake county, so it took us a while to check it out.  What a fabulous patio.  The vibe is so great.  Our first visit to the patio bar was so fun.  The adorable sisters: Bree and Erin are as knowledgeable about beer as they are cute!  My husband and I went with their menu recommendations and also got an appetizer that I couldn't resist.  The food was abundant and wonderful.  We had a blast at Reddstone and will definitely make it a regular trek.  It is definitely a \"must see\" for the young, the hip, and the hungry.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My first visit was for the Sunday Brunch. I purchased a Groupon deal online. The location was is convenient surrounded by the new battery park condo's.
The place was pretty busy of adults and kids. However there was one server and a bar back helper working. The service was horribly slow. I asked for water 3 times before we got it and waited for coffee refills too long. The server was however friendly which helps considering we had to wait a long time for service and ask repeatedly for things. The food was very good,warm, and flavorful. HANDS DOWN THE BEST PANCAKES I HAVE EVER HAD!! Overall the atmosphere was nice, I really liked the lights and tables. I will go again but hopefully they will be fully staffed when I do!! And they played great upbeat music!"}
{"text":"So disappointed with my last visit.  I've been here a few times and I always enjoy the food and the patio.  But the staff had no idea what they were doing.  Servers continued to walk past us for close to 10 minutes before the busboy finally stopped and asked if we needed anything.  He ended-up taking our dinner order.  He did tell us they were short-staffed that night, but that doesn't make-up for the complete disregard of customers waiting patiently.  On a positive note, my husband said his burger was cooked perfectly.  Sad to say we won't be going back."}
{"text":"This was a favorite neighborhood hang out. After 4 bad visits in a row I'm  Done with this place. WORST service in Cleveland!!!! Save your money and go someplace where they bring your food and drinks in a reasonable amount if time. Some (not all) of the staff are just rude."}
{"text":"went back last night in another saturday night branching-out attempt. 

i love the interior of this bar and the staff is friendly and fairly awesome, but i wanted to strangle half the patronage last night.

punk lady gaga dude and the other recent high school graduates should stick to peoples' basement parties instead of screaming 'HEY ASSHOLE' etc to each other across the bar. it isn't funny, it just makes you look like you should probably be carded at the door.

unless someone drags me here, i can safely assume i won't be back."}
{"text":"Meh.

My friend and I chose this restaurant because they had a patio and it was a beautiful day. It was probably the \"nicest\" feature of this restaurant.

Our waiter asked for our drinks, and I ordered a virgin mojito. He apologized and said they didn't have any mint. Alternatively, I asked for an iced tea, and he apologized and said they didn't serve tea. Okay, I'm trying not to be disappointed. I settled on a lemonade, and then put in my meal order for their duck pizza, which sounded very promising. He apologized because they didn't have any duck. I literally asked him if their restaurant was even open.

I settle for their thai chicken salad, which just tasted like salt. I'm not sure if it was they type of peanut sauce they used, or if they added soy, or what. My friend was excited to be there so I pretended not to be disappointed.

I guess the good news is that we were seated right away - but maybe now I know why!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place numerous times, play volleyball nearby and wings are 10¢ on Tuesday so we go. Well, I think I'm finally giving up on it. The owner does seem very nice and polite but some of the staff is less than helpful. The big problem is the service. A table of 5, ordered 3 orders of wings and 2 orders of fries. Took 1 hr. Granted, the wings are cheap and they'll be busy but 1 hr. is crazy. Apparently they have only 2 fryers which makes it pretty difficult but I think people will only put up with it so long. At this point I'm done waiting. The wings are good but the wait is not worth it."}
{"text":"Redd Stone is where the old Snickers used to be.  I hadn't been since the transition over, and I have to say, I'm a bit torn.

First off, the selection of music playing won hands down.   They played Ben Folds' cover of Dr. Dre's Bitches Ain't Shit.  Any place that plays Ben Folds is cool in my book.  aaaand they played another one of my favorites, so i was happy.  my problem?  the music was SOOOO LOOOOUD we couldn't hear each other talk.  i looked around the place and saw other groups of people hovering over their tables straining to hear each other talk.

as far as a restaurant, Redd Stone doesn't do too bad.  They have an interesting selection of food, higher scale and not \"bar food\", though they do have some of that.  a friend of mine actually got a really great steak.  so they don't play around here.

the decor is pretty nice, and the place was fairly busy for a thursday night.  an interesting mixture of scenesters and yuppies.  ah, the yupsters.

other downfall to redd stone?  the booths are so high they're hard to get into.  i hadn't even had much to drink and almost fell off trying to get out.  apparently people *have* fallen out of them.  and hurt themselves.  so if you've been drinking, avoid the booths.  you might have a drunken fall to pain the next morning.

overall, redd stone is a cool little place tucked in a neighborhood where you wouldn't expect it.  a bit loud, tasty food, interesting people watching, and damn good choice in music.

real rating? 3 1/2 stars.  or 3 3/4.  yeah.  three and three quarters.

i'd go back.  and i will. 

..and the eye candy wasn't bad either. mmm mmm mmm sugar rush."}
{"text":"Awesome patio, great bartenders, gem in Cleveland!

I would recommend this place to anyone looking to have a good time."}
{"text":"Finally went back to the patio. Loved it. Food was less than par. I had the pork salad - pork was cold and dry. Also had the mussels - they were pretty hot and for some reason the dynamite sauce was completely unappetizing. My boyfriend had the mushroom pizza. Pizza is a pretty hard dish to mess up, but Reddstone exceded in doing so. Let me just precede by saying that when he makes hummus he puts four to five cloves for one can of chickpeas - he LOVES garlic. He just ate a whole clove, raw today. The garlic sauce on that pizza was overwhelming. We will most likely not be back. If we do return, it will be to have a drink at the bar. Oh, I can't forget Nathan. Second time he served us - he's awesome! The only one working both times and he managed to bar tend and serve that patio area (restaurant seating was closed) flawlessly. Also, liked that we got our own jug of water."}
{"text":"EDIT: The FREE stand-up show is now at 9pm on TUESDAYS, the same night they have $0.35 wings (try the wasabi ranch!) and some beers for $3. 

EDIT AGAIN: As of March 2014, the Tuesday night wings are now $0.45 and they did away with the wasabi ranch (*SOB*), but there's still some decent beers for only $3 and the Tuesday comedy shows are still free and hella funny! Also, there's an additional comedy show MOST Saturdays for $6. 

Original post: Here for MORE free comedy thanks to @BlazerRamon ! Every Monday night at the @REDDSTONE , the draft are $3, small plates are half off and the open mic comedy is FREE!"}
{"text":"As my boyfriend and I approach The Reddstone Tavern the other night we hear Avril Lavigne belting out the first verse of \"Complicated.\"  I turn to him and joke \"uh, should we turn around?\"  Turns out, unless we wanted to spend the next 1.5 hours hearing the better part of \"Now Music Volume Awful,\" the answer was yes.

Aside from the music (actual selections included The Backstreet Boys, Brittney Spears, and the like at max volume), the place is actually pretty okay.  As others have mentioned, they have a great patio with an outside bar as well as tables.  It was warm enough to sit out there and as the evening started to cool they lit their charcoal burning fireplace which helped keep the temperature comfortable.

We were starving after a long day at work and decided to order an app as we sipped our (very weak) cocktails.  There were a bunch listed that seemed to be good possibilities, however, our server recommended the Tuna Tacos so we went with that.  They were really delicious - perfectly seared without being overdone, paired with a spicy guacamole, in a mini-taco salad type shell.

From there we split the caprese salad (with roasted heirloom tomatoes).  I thought the balsamic reduction and roasted tomatoes were well done, however, the salad itself was slightly over salted.  Admittedly, I'm sensitive to overly salty foods, however, my boyfriend was the one to bring this up.  It must have been some sort of coarse ground sea or rock salt because it wasn't just the taste but the overall mouth feel of the dish that this affected.

Finally, we split the traditional pizza (sausage, pepperoni, pepper jack).  It was okay - the sauce was a little too sweet for my taste, but it wasn't bad.  The dough itself was nothing to write home about.

Let's put it this way:  the place is affordable enough that I would go back if I'm in the shoreway and couldn't get into Luxe.  But I'd forego the cocktail, order a beer, and maybe go for the kobe beef meatball sub (like I had wanted to, but, they were out of) or one of the other apps."}
{"text":"Neat lil place, patio looked awesome but wasn't open do to the weather.  Drink prices were ok, and beer selection was pretty good.  Had a burger that was good but not worth 13 bucks.  Service was polite but SLOW!!! In her defense, the place was crowded and it seemed she needed more help.  Had a groupon which helped, but still seemed a lil pricey for what you got.  Not a bad place, not a great place..."}
{"text":"I organized a happy hour with some friends on Friday. I chose Redd Stone because we wanted to meet on a patio and an actual bar on the patio to mix and mingle about. Redd Stone is one of the top spots for that.

My strongbow was $6. In Cleveland. During Happy Hour. Really?

Supposedly, everything is a $1 off during Happy Hour. However, the bartender didn't give us the discount but our server did. 

They had a pretty fun guitarist/singer performing pop/rock hits. The singer was great, although the sound was a bit too loud.

Eye candy still popping. 

Great summer patio! One of my faves in town."}
{"text":"Cool outdoor patio.  Really random crowd from bikers to preppies...and the menu?  It looks like three chefs with different nationalities couldn't agree on a food theme.  Asian, American, Italian, you name it.  It's on their menu.  The tater tots were very good, actually.  Hand battered and served with a trio of sauces chipotle ketchup and 2 other white sauces--both of which were yummy).  My friend's mussels had a BBQ/spicy flavor to them and she said they were very tasty."}
{"text":"The patio is awesome, brick amongst lit trees.  The inside is nondescript and it's like a labyrinth trying to find the respective restrooms or get from the patio to the dining room.

The music is awesome there; 'nuff said.

The food is OK.  They try and create a gourmet-ish menu but fall short.  Had the Kobe corn dogs (tasted good but not worth $8 for 6) lombardo pizza (bad combo of ingredients) and the pulled pork (decent).  Another couple people had the veggie burger and reported it being extremely bland, the wings on another table seemed like they were plucked from a baby chick they were so small.

Service took FOREVER.  Close to 5-10 minutes for drink orders, about that long to get the drinks and a while to put in dinner orders, then a half-hour wait for food.  It seems they only have 2-3 people running the entire place (not including cooks) so the massive delays make sense, but c'mon!

An overall \"eh\" experience.

Also, beware of the \"Rounding\" fee.  In order to get the bill to the next $.25, the owner rounds all checks up to the closest $.25.  Regardless of party size, method of payment, etc.  There is no cut-off to round down; if your bill is $7.05, you'll have to pay $7.25.  Stupid Nickel-and-dime shyster s___."}
{"text":"The good:  great neighborhood, patio, food and people. The food is fun and tasty.
The bad:  the service the last two visits sucked.  Possibly the worst, but lucky for them I do not put too much value on service, at least not as much on food quality."}
{"text":"$2 tacos tonight.
Pulled pork with coleslaw. Yum, the sour cream on the side was delicious. The bartender was so sweet and entertaining- very nice vibe. Would be 5 Stars if they had more seating downstairs."}
{"text":"Best patio in Cleveland.  I may need to give it 5 stars for that!  It feels like you are in someones nicely decorated back yard.  They even have a little fire thing going when it starts to get cold.  
On top of that, they have really good food.  They also have some awesome specials on food during the week. 
The only reason for the 4 stars is that the drinks are sort of expensive.  It's not bad when you are buying tacos for 10 cents, but when you are just getting a drink on the weekend, paying downtown prices for a neighborhood-type bar is a little ridiculous."}
{"text":"The Reddstone is a great neighborhood bar where everyone is welcome! The patio is amazing, right next to Lake Erie, and the bartenders are first class, like you're neighbors!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on Valentine's day with my non-valentine date.  Reddstone was having an anti-valentine's day party.  Pretty cute with black flowers and anti-valentine slogans posted on hearts on the wall.

The bar is small and they had a dj playing average music.  There was not a dance floor or room to move around for dancing, but hey, you want a dj....go for it.

The booze was booze and I wasn't unhappy with the selections.  Reddstone has a menu, and while I didn't order anything, my non-date did; the food looked delicious, and the portions were HUGE!

My one complaint was that after a certain hour a different dj appeared and the music volume went from tolerable to ridiculous loud.  I had to SCREAM to be heard.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a music lover, I am, however, not deaf yet and would prefer to keep my hearing in-tact as long as possible.  I know the general consensus is louder = better, but this is SO not the case. My non-date and I ended up leaving because we couldn't even carry on a conversation.

Would I go back?  Sure, I liked this cute little \"hidden\" gem in the heart of Battery Park.  I will however leave if its too loud to speak and hear at a reasonable decibel."}
{"text":"First off, Food: 4.5 stars. Service. 2 stars. 

I have been here multiple times, and sat at the bar. This time I went with family for Taco Thursday and sat in the back patio. For such a popular place, they were sorely under-staffed.  Our food and drink orders were taken fairly quickly, and the tacos were absolutely delicious. I highly recommend the jerk chicken!!!  

When it came to getting our bill, everything went downhill. We had a Groupon.  It took over twenty minutes for our bill to be \"calculated.\" My husband went to go look for the staff and it still took more time. What is so hard about using a calculator and jotting down a redemption code? Surely if a business is going to do a promotion through a popular service like Groupon or Living Social, they need to be prepared to honor the coupon in a timely manner. 

Overall, I will probably go back for tacos, but I know for sure that my family will refuse to come with me. Poor form, Reddstone. You need to up the game."}
{"text":"First of all, I need to say if you can't sit outside, don't bother coming. The inside isn't much to brag about.

Anyway, I love eating here because it feels like I'm eating in someone's backyard. It's the epitome of summer to me and they play really great music. In a gentrified cute neighborhood of Cleveland and the food has never disappointed. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of the lack of indoor atmosphere and sometimes the service is slow. On a warm summer night, I'd definitely bring guests to Reddstone."}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday party.   They rented out the private room upstairs.  

The food was catered by Reddstone, and was pretty meh.  Pizza, cut vegetables and dip.

The beer prices were decent, selection somewhat limited upstairs. The birthday folks brought in Karaoke equipment which was a good time."}
{"text":"Well, I went to this place last summer and I said 'hey this is a cool restaurant 'We sat down and it took about an hour for them to take our order then another hour before we event got it.  I was there again this week after a hot volleyball game at Battery Park.  We popped in around 7 on Tuesday which was wing night so we knew it would be a little busy.  We put our name on a waiting list when there was clearly 8 tables open.  Went  to the bar, got a 'warm' beer after 15 minutes of waiting for it.  We were finally seated when a friend said something to the hostess because there were so many tables open.  She said 'we need to get caught up so we aren't seating people yet'.  Um excuse me?  You can at least seat us and say 'hey, we're a little backed up but can I get you guys a drink and get your order in? NOPE, she seated us about 20 minutes later.... Server came 20 minutes after we were seated and took our drink order, again, warm beer..... half hour later we all had to leave and didn't get to eat... there was a 10 dollar minimum on our card and we only spent 8 and they ACTUALLY made us pay the additional $2.  Really? because they're service was so bad,  we weren't able to eat.  The server had a nasty attitude and came back with our card.. In my opinion, the entire place is poorly run.  Here's an idea, HIRE MORE PEOPLE and maybe customers would actually leave satisfied.  I can't believe this place is actually in business.  This sucks that the volleyball leagues have one bar within walking distance from the courts and it happens to be the worst bar in Cleveland.  pathetic.

P.S. Tell your servers to LOSE the attitudes."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Reddstone!  It's a great corner bar and everyone including the staff are so nice.  I went there for drinks and had a blast and then went back to eat.  The food is amazing!  I had the Chef's special which was steak with mashed potatoes.  So good.  I would highly recommend Reddstone.  It's a guaranteed good time."}
{"text":"5 stars because I feel off-the-beaten path and it looks like they've got kick ass food. 

Stopped here after a long bike ride with Will and I must say that I was quite impressed. The exterior spoke modern, neighborhood bar to me. Exactly what the Battery Park area of Cleveland feels like. There were other bikes locked up out front. Always a plus! 

We were thirsty. Walked in and ordered my cheap, cold beer of choice - Rolling Rock -- and YES they had it! Sorry I find that some of the more upscale bars that I choose to frequent cannot indulge me quite like a server who can slam that green bottle down in front of me. 

By the way, did I mention it was Thursday? Do you know what Thursday means? Oh yes, it means 10cent tacos! Who does that?! No one, except Reddstone. The tacos are quite tasty despite their simplistic nature, meat and lettuce in a crunchy shell. They probably cook the meat like I would, with lots of taco seasoning and simmering in its own fatty juices. 

So a lot of other great things about this place. Bartender on Thursday was attentive, sweet, funny, and quite beautiful. She never needed to hover but was always back as my beer came to its end. Perfect timing every time. About five times. 

I believe I saw a sign saying Wednesdays were 15cent wings, flats or drummies. During Browns games Reddstone offers up nickel beers and I believe they had a pig roast a week or two ago. I've also heard the patio is quite nice but I didn't venture that far. 

I will be back Reddstone. You just sit pretty right there. And to the rest of you, check it out. Their menu looks inventive, respectable liquor and beer selection, good service."}
{"text":"High hopes. That's what I had for Reddstone. Maybe it was the day or just needs another shot but for now...I've experienced better. But there is potential with a great patio in the new venue location of Battery Park. 

Word around the office was that this place was nice-great patio-good food. So when I saw restaurant.com had a special I bought it thinking it was worth a shot. It ended up being a nice night so we went in around 9:30 and were seated in the far corner on the patio. Lighting...none. Although I'm one for the ambiance, I'd also like to see what I'm putting in my mouth. 

We started with drinks and appetizers. This was the highlight of the meal! The Hummus and the 5 Spice Beef Noodles were delicious. Out of the 5 of us 4 burgers were ordered and I ordered the Pulled BBQ Chicken Melt. I think they should consider ciabatta bread in the future. It came served on sourdough bread. Grilled mind you, but by the time it came to the table...soggy. The burgers were good size and the fries both plain and sweet potato were eh just ok in my book. 

Our server was nice and attentive but at the same time it took forever for the food to arrive and one of the burgers came with sweet potato not plain fries. I'd say inexcusable for somewhere of this caliber. 

I may try again...maybe for just drinks and apps. But c'mon Reddstone...step up your game!!!"}
{"text":"Good wings. Expensive beers. Would go back on a night they had a special or if I had a gift certificate."}
{"text":"Oh yeah...I've been here too.

Now...I've been giving out a lot of four-star ratings lately (mainly because I rarely go someplace that I think will be bad)...and I wanted to rip off a quattro for this joint as well...but in the end, I just couldn't.

And I'll tell you why:

The effervescent Magic Lee Malicious wanted to eat outside...who am I to argue with that? She picked up my no-good ass and drove us to the Redd Stone Tavern. 

She gave me the history of the place on the way...how it'd changed hands several times, blah blah blah, finally ending up at its current state.

We got there, wanting to sit out back obviously. After 2-3 minutes of standing and looking confused, a waitress finally acknowledged us, and led us to a table that was hidden behind a tree.

I wasn't drinking, so I ordered a coke. It had no fizz. 

We shared the Muffalletta (sp?) and a salad. The salad was awesome, sandwich was pretty good. Easily shared by two. 

We got the fried Oreo dessert. It was pretty good as well.

Why three stars? Well...not really sure. I'm not *really* a fan. At the same token, it *was* a slight cut above A-OK.

If I had the joint, the back porch would be a bit more swept, we'd be serving BBQ, and the place would be jamming.

So...that's my story, and I'm sticking to it.

Well, unless someone takes me there again."}
{"text":"This place is literally a block away from where I live. I could walk there in 2 minutes. And yet I've only been there once, and not sure if I'll be back. The patio seems nice though so maybe I'll be back in the summer for that. 
The menu is very limited, especially for vegetarians. I wanted like a side of something to go with my beer. There wasn't really any other option so I got fries. Turns out these are the biggest pile of fries in cleveland. They were well flavored, a bit salty even.
The place is nice and cozy. Beer and drinks are fine, nothing to rave about. I didn't pay that night so I don't know what the damage was but maybe next time I'll use the yelp 10 for  20 deal. But really there's like nothing for me to eat here. Too bad. Maybe it's good for the omnivores. Maybe I'll come for comedy night. When is that?"}
{"text":"Have you been to Reddstone lately!?
There's a new fall menu with lots of yummy options. The chicken philly & the fall salad are both delicious.The staff is way more attentive than prior visits. 
They still have wing night / trivia on tues., $5 burgers on wed., & taco / trivia nights on thurs.
Check out the photos!"}
{"text":"While the patio is to die for that is about all that keeps me returning to Reddstone.

I play volleyball at the nearby Battery Park sand courts and we go to Reddstone each Thursday night for their $0.10 tacos.

I am a recent full vegetarian and navigating the landscape has been mostly smooth, but Reddstone threw in a pothole. 

The service at Reddstone is atrocious. Over the past year we have had an obvious coke user as a waitress, an extremely indifferent and rude woman and lately, inexperienced, non-critically thinking staff. The atmosphere is wonderful, but the service is atrocious. The owner is a nice guy, seems to know what he is doing, expect his front of the house staff. I have yet to be served by an attentive and kind waitress, instead it appears he just hires for looks? meh. Desperation? Maybe.

Back to $0.10 tacos. The tacos are greasy meat which varies in consistency from week to week. When I was a carnivore, they weren't bad, had some spice to them...but now that I am of the herbivores; I was abruptly denied a taco haven. I was told there were no substitutions...okaaaay, but what about the vegetarians? \"Sorry, no substitutions.\" Once you add on jalapeños, cheese and sour cream, all for $0.50 apiece it isn't even worth just buying a plain shell for the taco deal. 

The only redeeming factor, outside of the patio, is the cheap beers Reddstone offers. You can get a tallboy PBR or Miller High Life for $3. Not bad. $2 Coronitas or $3 margaritas on Thursdays are a decent deal.

All in all, I was and have been sorely disappointed for some time. For all the positive press this place gets, you think the owner would invest a bit more in its staff as well as fares that appeal to more consumers...it would mean a regular Thursday night customer out of me."}
{"text":"Great place to hang. Great food specials. Great happy hour. Tuesday nights are free comedy night. Usually starts around 9:00. I usually come up every Tuesday. Who doesn't like to laugh, enjoy good food and booze. If you haven't been here before. Make it a point to come out."}
{"text":"So we were in town visiting relatives and my brother-in-law wanted to try Reddstone. He had never been and thought that it looked like a cool space. We stopped in around 8pm on Saturday night and it was a tight fit. The restaurant is pretty small with a long bar to one side and some bench seating scattered around. The bottom line is that it's small. Get ready to get cozy with your neighbors really fast.

The decor is your basic Cleveland dive bar complete with red string lights and a disco ball. This must be what the inside of the Mustang Ranch looks like. The four of us took a seat and the server immediately came over with menus. She was friendly enough and within a few minutes we all had our drinks in hand.

The beer selection is just this side of average. If I remember correctly there were 6 taps (mostly macros) with a couple crafts. I went with the Stone IPA. Always a great beer. 

The menu offers a rather wide selection of dishes with everything from your standard bar fare (wings nachos and the like) to sandwiches and even pizza. Not a bad selection. I opted for the fries and chicken quesadilla. First, the good. The fries were very tasty. Thin-cut with the skin on and tossed with a seasoning mix (salt, pepper, maybe some garlic powder) they were a nice rendition. I asked for some malt vinegar and mayo to make a dip and all was good. 

Now the bad, the quesadilla. Where to start...the chicken quesadilla was made using a tomato flour tortilla and the innards consisted of grilled onions, cheese and chicken. The chicken was extremely dry and chewy and there were way too many onions. I also had a problem with how it was served. It was cut into four pieces and all of the pieces were then stacked on top of each other on a tiny side plate. The grease from the cheese had basically turned everything into a bug mushy mess. To top it off they had covered the entire thing in what they call \"sha sha\" sauce. According to our server this is a mixture of sour cream and siracha hot sauce. What it tasted like to me was mayo and Tabasco. Whatever it was, it was not good. There were also black beans and scallions on top which didn't add anything to the dish. I took two bites and left the rest.

Another member of our party had ordered the \"macho nachos\" and actually had to send them back. What arrived can only be described as a train wreck on a plate. It was a mass of congealed cheese, tortilla chips, shredded chicken, scallions, and some other things that couldn't be identified. To add insult to injury the entire thing was ice cold. Oh yeah, and we got to meet the sha sha sauce again. The nachos were drenched in it. Inedible.

The visit wasn't all bad. The highlight of the meal had to be the mussels. While I don't personally dig mussels, everyone else at the table raved about them and their accompanying curry cream sauce. These were an apparent home run.

Some of my favorite places are little holes in the wall like Reddstone. Their slightly out of the way and filled with character. What's not to like? Reddstone has the out of the way part right and there's a nice does of local character. They've even got a nice-looking deck (closed when we were there). Where I think they fall short is with their food. I'm sure there are some nuggets to be found within the whole that is their menu and we actually managed to stumble across a few. Unfortunately, it won't be enough to draw me back. Sorry, Reddstone, but I think you're destined to remain a one night stand."}
{"text":"This neighborhood patio only bar has become one of my favorite recently.  I stopped here after a day long sand volleyball games at Battery Park sand VB courts. Although my team did not win, stopping by at Reddstone for several glasses of Summer Shandy was just a sweet victory. Their patio is fully covered naturally with the small fireplace in the center. Various round and rectangular tables on this multi level patio allow for quiet tucked away corner hang-outs or dead center 'to-be-seen' seating.  The long L shaped bar also allow for comfortable seating under a Tiki type feel.

Seating aside, they have a significant list of beer on tap - one of them my seasonal favorite - Summer Shandy. Their brunch menu extends well past 2pm especially on the weekends.  The Ultimate Breakfast Burrito is truly an ultimate of size and taste. A tomato wrap stuffed with scrambled eggs, red pepper, bacon, jalapeño, spicy sausage, pepper jack, bacon and served over a concoction of sautéed caramelized onions and fresh salsa. Once you start you cannot put it down, and I wouldn't have if it wasn't for is ultimate size.  Their Curried Tofu Club made of crispy tofu, tomato, turkey bacon, spicy edamame aioli served over crispy ciabatta and garnished with bean sprouts,is full of taste explosion even to someone who isn't a usual tofu fan. The tofu is just the right crisped and the aioli is finger licking good.

During my visit, the whole bar and the patio was being waited on just one solitary bar tender. Bless his soul - despite his best of attempts, service was painfully slow. My saving grace of the company I was with and the great conversation being had. It took 20 min just to be served our first round of drinks and the time got longer thereafter. C'mon Reddstone with you popularity you got to employ mor wait staff on weekend afternoons especially if a large event is happening right across the parking lot. I only hope my next visit isn't plagued by such issues.

I am anxious for my next visit and I've got the \"Cleveland Heart-Attack\" & \"The Dirty Sanchez\" in my sights. Let me tell you I never miss when I've got my sights on a tasty 'dish'."}
{"text":"One of my favorite patios in Cleveland.  Food is reasonably priced and drinks are expensive.  Fun spot to hang out at until around 11 PM.  At that time the staff will ask that you be quiet due to the fact that the neighbor's home is literally 5 feet from the back bar.
Tasty food and great space that is worth the visit."}
{"text":"I wanted to give 4 stars as the atmosphere and food were very nice.  But a couple of things brought their rating down:

1. Rather limited menu.  There are some interesting dishes on the menu but its really just burgers and pizza. But then again, if that's what you want, you will really enjoy these dishes.  The burgers are easily the best in Cleveland.  I had the BBQ Duck pizza and it was very good.  I was told that the winter menu is more expansive and so I will have to visit again to see what they have.  

2. Cocktails served in plastic cups.  There is no excuse for this given the drink prices.  

I would definitely come back to try out their fall and winter menus.  There is a lot of potential here."}
{"text":"*Ahh-hem* Did you say 10¢ tacos? 

As in a dime each? 

Like, 10 pennies? 

SOLD!

There is no better deal on a taco night than Reddstone on Thursdays. Yes, that's right. I didn't say Tuesday. And let me tell you, these little 10¢ crunchy tacos are a delightful surprise. Tasty, fresh and hey...they're a DIME EACH! I mentioned that? Oh -- OK.

These tasty tacos come with meat and lettuce, but you can add cheese for 50¢ each. Now, before you get all crabby about the add-ons, please consider that if you add cheese to each, that still only bumps up the price tag to 60¢ each. Throw some hot sauce on those bad boys and I'm in heaven! Every other taco deal in town starts out at $1-1.50 at least! (And that's before the add-ons) Now, you can order sides of salsa, jalapenos and sour cream for a little extra, but I never do. I'm a taco purist. All I need is some lettuce, a sprinkle of cheese and lots of Sriracha and I'm golden. Oh, and for cryin' out loud...order a damn drink or a pop at least! The tacos are already dirt cheap. Asking for just a water is ridiculous. 

There are other reasons why I come to Reddstone. The patio is huge, gorgeous and right out of a magazine or something. You literally feel like you're sitting in someone's big backyard. They have a fire place to warm yourself by, lush foliage everywhere and they left the trees intact. The strings of old-fashion white lights really lay the charm on thick, too. Such a great vibe. 

Winter is coming soon, but you better believe that I'll be back on Thursdays for that taco night -- patio weather, or not! This is a thrifty gal's dream right here!"}
{"text":"I came here for the 10 cent taco nights on Thursday.  Nothing special.  But what does one expect for 10 cents I guess.  In fact, I am breaking their rules by bitching about it.  Yep, there is a list of rules one must follow on taco night.  They also include a two drink minimum and leaving your table to go to the bar immediately after you're finished eating.  Maybe I'm being a little uptight, but I like the friendly approach better.  

The 10 cent tacos: +50 cents for cheese +50 cents for sour cream +50 cents for salsa = $1.60 taco in a plain jane taco bell shell.

They have specialty tacos too.  They had an Indian Red Curry Taco, an Ahi Tuna, and a Buffalo Chicken.  The Buffalo Chicken was decent.  It had the fried shell, but was still skimpy on the toppings.  Also, it was listed as $2, but we were charged $3.50.  We pointed it out and they seemed fully aware the price was incorrect, but I don't think they would have said anything if we didn't.  All in all, our bill for 3 \"10 cent tacos\", 2 \"$2 Specialty Tacos\", and 4 draft beers was $30.  Not too shabby I guess.

OK - enough complaing...

I had the Brooklyn Lager on tap - it was so good!  The service was great as well.  The tacos came out quick and our server was really sweet.  They blast indie rock, which isn't for everyone, but I didn't particularly mind.  The patio is wonderful!  It's canopied in trees and has a wood burner, draped lights - the atmosphere was really cool.  I guess I would like to go back to try their regular menu, but I'll get my tacos elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Sometimes this place is 5 stars, sometimes it's maybe 2 stars.  It's a bar with bar food.  I don't go here expecting fancy food.  Good burgers, good wings, good beers.  The beer list isn't amazing, but it gets the job done with a good mix of great and budget friendly brews.  The comedy events are also a nice touch.  Where Reddsone fails is in the inconsistent service. Sometimes, the food is speedy.  Sometimes, it takes forever.  Some servers are amazing and I love them.  Others, move so fast and without any sense of customer service that you feel the person would rather you not be there at all.  It's amazing to sit at a bar and only see the bartender rushing around and working the register rather than asking customers if they need anything.  I shouldn't have to yell and flag someone down every single time I need anything at all.  Depending on who's working, that might happen.  But you may also get the best server ever who will actually remember you from each visit even if you aren't a regular.  So... service runs all over the spectrum.  Even so, I still come back to this place once or twice a week as I like the atmosphere the patrons bring.  It's always a place where I meet new people and have a genuinely good time.  I just wish they would change up staff sections a little bit and recognize which servers need more help in the bar room.  If they did that, I think this place would be back to five stars."}
{"text":"Burgers and Beer by the Beach! After a beautiful bike ride in from Lakewood and a day at Edgewater beach, I wanted to head up through the new glacier like walkway. After coming through to the other side, If you head straight ahead you will run into the Reddstone. I had come here about a year back and felt a little weird about the place but on my most recent visit I saw that the Reddstone is really moving in an awesome direction. They have a new menu with cool snacks like watermelon and jalapeno poppers, and if you are a little hungrier great wings, flatbreads and killer burgers, make sure to get that fried egg on there! They also have a new line up of tasty craft cocktails ( A REAL Daiquiri, an awesome Moscow Mule) and a beer selection with cool new brews I hadn't tried yet. The patio is really one of the best in Cleveland, its the best place to hang out after a day at the new and improved Edgewater. Its the perfect summer time spot but I also cant wait to drink bourbon and escape the winter in the warm, beautiful bar inside. Great neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness there is new ownership, management, staff and menu.  Reddstone has one of the BEST patios in the Tri-Neighborhood area (Tremont, Ohio City and Detroit Shoreway).  The food selection is not only wide and diverse but outstanding.  The portions are more than fair and the taste and quality definitely rank up there with the best in the neighborhood.  Plus they have a specialty drink menu that at first looks intimidating, but is actually delicious.  Someone who is a professional put a lot of time and effort in to creating a both interesting and delightful drink menu.  A note about the staff and management, this was the downfall to the old Reddstone.  It is obvious that has changed.  No more rude staff and uninterested management.  Also they are doing specials almost every night of the week.  We went for Taco Thurs.  $3 tacos and Drink Specials.  I know this sounds steep but I would call the tacos \"gourmet\" and 3 will fill you nicely.  Plus they ran some of the specialty drinks on special so dinner and drinks were a steal!  Our group also had the wings (OUTSTANDING AS WELL) and the flat bread (YUMMO).  Everything was delicious.  I am looking forward to wing night on Tuesdays.  Again, GOOD JOB on the new Reddstone!  We are excited to have a good restaurant/bar in that building!"}
{"text":"soooo after purchasing a groupon for this  lovely little establishment, we decided to venture out into the snow, wind and ice for a 'relaxing' dinner.....

we had never been here before so this was a brand new experience.....after driving through the streets of cleve town to finally make it here, we ended at our destination..... it's not located in the most desirable part of town, however, as long as your packing heat, you're sure to be good to go....(lol. kidding. sort of.)...it's located near the far north end of w.76th, so if you are driving thru the neighborhood  looking like you are not in the right vicinity, you probably are right where you need to be.....
looking at the outside, it appears to be sort of a derelict looking hang-out, that you might just belly up to the bar with a homeless person,  but keeping that in mind, that we DID just buy a groupon, we decided to venture in. 

what appears to be the front door, under the large sign that says \"REDDSTONE\" is actually not. fake out.....after peeping into the window and tugging the door handle, we found ourselves staring in at two patrons eating their dinner. yikes. 

the  REAL door is actually  on the side of the place. upon entering, there are stairs going up....and the actual bar/restaurant is to your right....but when you walk in, there was no direction....do we seat ourselves, do we just stand here, what next? i should mention is WAS WAY CROWDED. so yes, we looked like two little wolf cubs scared of what we were supposed to do amongst all these people. 

lucky for us, the manager, or whom, i seem to think is the manager, asked if we needed a table and asked if we could sit at the bar for a moment while he cleared a spot. the bartender then contradicted what he just told us 2.7 seconds earlier, that there were no tables available, as she had a 10 top table coming in and the manager (or manager looking guy) was not aware.....uh, ok. now what?????

so our choice....eat dinner at the bar or leave.....BUT lo and behold manager looking guy told us he found a table. lucky us!  (we were not completely opposed to eating at bar.....) 

anyway, long story short end. the groupon was for a limited item listing. it was for app, 2 house salads and a pizza, (with your choice of only either make your own 2 topping or the cleveland something....the chicken pizza was not available for the groupon, even though it was the same price as the cleveland one.....interesting. 

the appetizer we chose were the nachos....one word. HUGE ASS. ok, two words.  taste was meh....(would not order again).....the house salads.....aHHHHHHMMMAAAAZZING. the dressing was delish. would def get again....pizza.....uh, negative. save your pizza meal for an authentic pizza place. 

service: one word: HORRIBLE. very friendly servers, but took forever to give order, get bill, pay bill, etc. etc. etc. the one girl did apologize that there were only two servers and they did not expect to be this busy.....um, ok. let's think about this. you offer a groupon/cheap dining deal, yet you staff with only two peeps? what up with that??? 

anyway, we finally paid our bill and were on our way, back out in the ice/snow/slush.....

p.s. i was told by a friend that the patio is pretty cool, so we might be brave to venture one more time during dining al fresco season........maybe. 

overall....food meh. i was not impressed by any means. the blueberry basal lemonade drink was delish....and could easily see myself cozied up on the patio chilling with one of these in hand.... xo"}
{"text":"UPSIDE:  This place has great wings and the owner Jeff is very friendly.  It's fun for watching a Cavaliers/ Browns game because everyone's friendly to each other.  
I also like the neighborhood that it's in a lot.  

DOWNSIDE: If it weren't for the nice owner I would rate it lower.  You get the feeling that you're at a Dick's Last Resort by the snobbish service the female hipster waitresses give you."}
{"text":"A $25 gift certificate purchased for $3 (after entering promo code: \"SAVE\") on Restaurant.com brought us to Reddstone. That alone is incentive enough to visit. 

The inconspicuous building is located at the end of a residential street on the corner of Battery Park Blvd and W 76th. It's easy to miss if you're not looking for it. I don't remember any obvious signage out front.  

There are several entrances into Reddstone, but on this pleasant summer evening we chose the outdoor patio. From the patio you can see the infamous smoke stack in the distance with \"Battery Park\" displayed vertically in red neon lights. The patio itself is spacious, brick lined and consisting of hodge podge furniture. Lights are strung from trees to make this outdoor space worthy of a meal or spirits well after the sun goes down. I like how the patio was built around the trees and they weren't torn down to accommodate the space. It's a very cozy, serine space. It almost feels like a tranquil backyard. 

As for the menu, I found it limited and uninspiring. I was a tad disappointed that my choices were limited to salads, burgers, sandwiches, pizzas and just 5 entree's.  While this menu may be appropriate for the average overall diner, I found it amateurish for a restaurant nearing other inspiring culinary destinations. 

Our meal started with drinks of a Summer Shandy and a fruity cocktail of some sort, both served in plastic cups. Next, we had the Crispy Veggie Rolls that tasted like they came from the frozen aisle and not made in-house. Next, my accomplice had the Funky Chicken Sandwich and I the Hanger Steak ordered medium rare with Salsa Verde. The steak came out much more on the medium side and arranged already sliced and stacked like a teepee with tiny shoestring fries and salsa smothered over top. Good, but not enough to leave any lasting impressions. 

Overall, I enjoyed my time at Reddstone and if I was in the area, I would definitely come back to sit on the patio for drinks or meet friends at the outdoor bar, but as for a full blown meal? I'll pass. Too many other choices in a 2.5 mile radius."}
{"text":"I have this thing where I am much more likely to go to your restaurant if you have a menu posted somewhere (website, Facebook, whatever). The down side of this is that you can get your heart set on something only to not have it available. Such is the case with Reddstone. 

I went for their lunch hours on Friday with a coworker. The place was dead. Totally empty when we walked in, and with the eerie reddish light and all black furniture I wondered if I had accidentally wandered into a crack bar. 

The menu, despite being three dog eared pages printed on copy paper, is 1/3 of the menu they have online. The salad I was lusting over? Not there. Nor was the sandwich my cohort wanted. He was brave and asked if they could make it anyway. Not wanting to be a pain, I settled on the French dip. 

He got the Reuben \"Asia\" (SCHEZUAN HOUSE CORNED BEEF, KIMCHI SOUR KRAUT, CREAMY SESAME ISLAND, SWISS, RYE), which I thought had sounded good but actually ended up looking kind of gross. He liked it though, which is what counts.  I got the Dip the French (SLOW ROASTED BRISKET, SWISS, FRENCH BREAD, AU JUS), which was actually on two slices of sourdough rather than French bread. 

The brisket had a few pockets of fat and overall it was really chewy - it could have benefited from a few more hours of \"low and slow\". Honestly though, any negativity toward the brisket paled in comparison to the bread. It was soaked in butter prior to grilling. Soaked. With each bite I could taste the butter oozing out of the bread and into my mouth. I don't normally eat very greasy food, so that could be a factor, but after  1/2 a sandwich I was so sick to my stomach I couldn't continue. I was sick for the rest of the day.

Sandwiches came with shoestring fries (no mention of the daikon slaw that's also on the online menu) and a neon yellow pickle. I never turn down a pickle, but this one looked like it was exposed to some type of nuclear meltdown. -

I have to assume that the place is better at dinner with a full menu and a kitchen that's actually ready to feed people. If it isn't, I am  not sure how this place sustains the hype."}
{"text":"We went for brunch on Sunday and couldn't have had a better experience! The patio is dog friendly and all the employees were super nice to us and our dogs. The food was fresh, local and organic. The chef really focuses on presentation and flavors. The manager came by all tables to make sure everything was okay, good guy. The place is a hidden gem for sure!"}
{"text":"Yelp really needs to get up to date.  Reddstone was re-opened with new management, new menus and new decor this spring and it's fantastic!  The actual website is http://www.reddstonecleveland.com/.  I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially if you like a good patio."}
{"text":"Had to walk to the bar numerous times to order our beers and a burger.  When we spoke up about we get attitude and were told \"your server came in late\"...what the hell does that even mean?  She was waiting on us initially and then dissapeared for a while then we see her B.S 'ing behind the bar.  Now why do WE get the attitude?  7 people all with empty beers/drinks but WE are wrong?  Come to find out guy throwing the 'tude around is the owners brother!  Hahahahah  hell of a way to represent business...  I will wait till the end of time if you keep my beer full and have somewhat of a nice disposition but I didnt get anything of the sort....  If your gonna charge people 8.00 dollars for mixed drink (in an oh-so original mason jar) at least try to fake be nice."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar because I was dining alone. It took forever for the bartender who was at the bar to even acknowledge  my existence to say nothing of getting a drink order  from me.  He finally took my order and that was last I saw him for quite some time. My drink remained  unrefilled for an extended period of time.  Once my burger finally arrived it was the wrong burger improperly prepared. After sending the burger back it did arrive properly prepared. While I was dining at least three other orders came out wrong from the kitchen. The bartender who is my server apparently messed up multiple orders.  It took forever to get my check but when I finally did the bartender met me with complete disgust.  He seems preoccupied with getting a beer tap working throughout my entire dining experience. I saw him take several glasses of beer from the tap and drink them.  All and all I found the food mediocre. And service staff below par."}
{"text":"Best Service Ever !! They were slammed busy & still made me feel welcomed. The hostess went the extra mile to get us a table, our server practically wrestled a crowd to get us drinks! This is a fantastic little place."}
{"text":"Oh, how I miss patio weather. 

Don't get me wrong - Reddstone is a pretty decent place year round...but the patio really makes this bar stand out from the crowd.

I stopped by for a drink one wintery Saturday afternoon and was surprised to see how empty the bar was. The bartender told me that winter is their slow season and they make up for it by hosting a lot of private parties. I looked over the menu to see if there were any vegan appetizer options (there weren't) and decided to go with one of the seasonal drink features. I had a pomegranate martini. It was great! It tasted like actual fruit juice and not just flavored liqueur. My fiance picked a seasonal beer from their extensive beer list. The bartender did a great job describing the different beers and even let him have a sample when he was unsure of what he wanted.

This bar is a great place to hang out year round, but I really can't wait until it's patio season again. You haven't really lived unless you're been day drinking on the patio at Reddstone."}
{"text":"I have been really disappointed with the menu and atmosphere now that the bar has been \"renovated\".  The patio is amazing for the summertime, but the inside is cramped and dark. While they have pretty good mixed drinks, there is still not a big selection of beers and their food is way overpriced. $14 for a burger? No thanks. Their happy hour has also downgraded. Now I only go here begrudgingly when others want to go."}
{"text":"Enjoyable environment.. Decent beer selection. WORST service ever- every time I've been there. I've given it far too many chances. I live in battery park and am yearning for an amazing bar/restaurant to join the area in walking distance - reddstone isn't it. The food is ok- but they've just changed their menu and now their offerings are even more truncated. Wish their service would improve and I'd be there frequently!!"}
{"text":"For the longest time, I thought the \"S\" in ReddStone was an \"&\" symbol due to the letter spacing on the plastic mug I have at home from them. That would mean that for at least a full year, I thought the name of the place was Redd & Tone. I am such an idiot. 

On a Tuesday night, (which happens to be 15¢ wing night) Lorrie and I rode bikes so she could get some exercise an I could get some chicken wings. We had a 15 minute wait so we went to the bar for some drinks that only took ten minutes to be arrive. I understand that good things take time to create, but pulling the handle on the tap is a simple process that does not involve a major undertaking that takes too much time. The bartender that was running the bar solo was busy, and she had a lot going on - maybe the other bartender skipped work or something. 

We were seated and ordered more drinks while we glanced at the menu and waited for our waitress who I am not sure actually remembered we were there. 

After out first order of wings (hot for myself and garlic for her) arrived forty minutes later due to \"the kitchen not getting the order\" we asked for another round of drinks. I think you get the point here - the service was terrible, but we were putting up with it because the food was good. I may be dumb but I know where to draw the line. 

When we hit three hours and we were waiting, again, for our second order of wings and our drinks spent more time empty than full we knew we weren't going to be served in any respectable fashion.  If your customers first order is forgotten about, make sure the second order is taken care of quickly, otherwise don't expect them to be there when you get around to bringing the check.

Good food, terrible service."}
{"text":"Amazing food and a great patio. I'm looking forward to coming back. Kellie was our server and was great with a big crowd."}
{"text":"Cool little place. Great to hang out with a small group of friends"}
{"text":"This review is based on service only. We didn't even get to the food or drinks.

We went to Reddstone on a Thursday and were told there were no seats outside, and to sit inside which is fine. When we got in, there was a trivia night that was pretty fun, but we sat at our table for a long time without service. We finally asked one of the staff, but he told us he was a bar back and didnt know if there was table service, which was strange. Finally after another 20 or so mins, the bartender came over to tel us there was no table service. At that point we had had enough. There's no consistency about when there is service and not. Will be hesitant to come back"}
{"text":"Not on the top of my list of places to go. Here's why:

I've been here a handful of times. Ownership has changed a couple different times. Once I came here after a browns game, and didn't feel like drinking beer, so I asked the bartender if they had any wine. Instead of a simple, \"No, I'm sorry, we don't,\" the bartender decided to get smart with me and, which quite an attitude, said that if I wanted wine, \"you can go across the street where there's a wine bar. Why would we have wine here?\" Really dude? Why would you have customers here? Or should I say how and not why.

The patio is ok, some parts of it seem like it needs some weeding. The only reason I would go here if for taco night, or if I wanted to sit outside and/or taco night. This place is really hit or miss. Service sucks. Rude rude rude."}
{"text":"OK.  I read the reviews and was not sure what we were walking into.  This is in an up and coming redeveloped neighborhood.  The building seems to not resemble what the pictures dictate.  However, I really didnt care I was there for food.  We sat out on the patio and yes it is nice.  However, to call it the best patio in our area?  WOW some folks need to get out more.  Because of the neighborhood I would have expected a much more \"Fresh\" menu.  While the menu is very limited I did see a table of ladies eating what looked to be nice salads.  Our server was one of the better servers that we have had in several places in Cleveland.  Knowledgeable in the menu and took the time to walk through some suggestions.  We ordered the Kimchie Roll.  This was billed as a spring roll.  We were thinking fresh Sushi Spring roll.  However, it was fried.  Very good but fried.  We both ordered the Taco Trio.  My wife asked if she could sub pork for Chicken or Shrimp.  Answer yes to chicken as for the shrimp there would be an upcharge.  Not a problem.  Shrimp Taco very good.  fresh pico and good flavor.  Pork was really doused in bbq sauce so that left a bit to be desired.  Chicken was grilled but I think it was in a holding pan due to the grease that rolled off of our tacos to our suprise.  Good but greasy.  If Reddstone is looking for a menu suggestion I would scrap the pork and or greasy chicken and add a fresh grilled fish taco. As I said the toppings were great but they missed the mark with the main ingredient.  Overall I was a bit disappointed in Reddstone.  I think this place has great potential.  However, the limited menu and the food prep may have me looking to another establishment next time I am in the neighborhood.  Last point.  While in the restroom (very clean)  I was reading the poster about their fresh peach Sangria!  Convinced my wife to order this because she loves sangria and it was 95 today.  They brought out a very nice sized sangril (mason Jar) However, the bartender jacked it up with Lemons and Limes? WTH? Would have been great without the citrus.  We get citrus all winter long in Cleveland.  In the summer guests want fresh fruits (peaches) with a drink of this nature.  Hope they get it together.  This place could be a goldmine."}
{"text":"15 cent wing night... ahem, what? When all the big box corporate bars are offering \"deals\" such as .45 cent wings when you buy a pitcher of crappy beer? 

      JK.  I'm all about it. 

      The deal is you have to buy a min. of ten wings and two drinks. Go during happy hour, when its not super busy. They offer at least ten different flavors and rubs, all in varying degrees of heat. I really enjoyed the mango habanero sauce, the perfect blending of heat and sweet. The spicy ranch was also really good, so was their flavor of the month that I can't recall the name but it included crushed up berry crunch (you know, the captain crunch stuff!). They went perfectly with my (one too many) Brooklyn lagers. My only complaint is it started getting super super crowded, which really says something about this bar. I'm just weird and like a bit of breathing space. Otherwise, Reddstone has something for everyone."}
{"text":"An awesome patio in Cleveland to hang out in the summer months! This patio is really super cute and cozy, but big enough to come with a group. I usually go for drinks but I've had the calamari (I want to be a calamari connoisseur, I always order it) and this is definitely a contender for one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"I'm with Habby on this one.  I really want to like this place, and I generally do, but there are some things I would complain about in private, not out loud to the group that I'm with.  I don't like ruining a good time.  

I went for brunch and bloody's with a few friends and we pretty much had the place to ourselves when we arrived.  Bloody's were great, and the brunch menu looked awesome.  Except, they were out of 2 items (which happened to be my 1st and 2nd choices) out of the maybe 10 possible items on the Brunch selection.  I guess they're not too big on brunch?  

More people came in as we stayed a big longer, but the one bartender on duty did a good job maintaining good service.  However, the more people coming in, the more Bloody's ordered, and the glasses ran out.  He substituted them for a glass about half of the size (but same price).  I didn't like that.  I don't care the shape of the glass, just give me a decent size drink.

I would have normally sat at the bar, but with a few of us we thought the table would be better designed for chatting.  It was an awkward high table with a bench on one side and chairs on the other.  It's probably better for nightlife that way, but kinda weird for our meal.  

The food was okay, but again, not what I wanted.  I probably won't be back for brunch.  The upstairs is a very nice scene for a private party, I should add.  I really enjoyed my time up there, but that is solely based on atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have come to Reddstone a handful of times over the last few years. I see the same trend-- Pretty good food, mediocre beer selection, and of course awesome patio chill atmosphere. When the patio finally opened back in April, it was a 3 hr dinner due to such horrible service. My boyfriend ended up emailing the management and never heard back. Such a great local joint, just wish they had more/improved help. However, I will be back bc of the patio, as long as I'm not in a hurry to be anywhere!"}
{"text":"10 cent tacos on Thursdays. These prices seem fake. I didn't believe it 'til I went up there. Can't vouch for the tacos as I have not yet tried them. The wings are good though. The hot is not a typical hot sauce, it has flakes of red pepper. The other flavors were also good."}
{"text":"I shouldn't be writing this. One, there are already enough good reviews for this place. Two,i'm  at work. But I just had to see if I could write a review completely via Vortex. 

So after a quiet start to my Blackout Wednesday at Deagan's, the party moved to Reddstone. Joined by yelpers M@!! andP@#3/@, and members of the bad movie  fan club, I had  me some Blue Moon draughts. Very tall pours at 5 bones apiece is not too pricey for me(others have lamented over the high prices here). The awesome soundtrack was all early  90's r&b(Color Me  Badd, Mark Morrison,etc.) Bartenders were very nice and quick with the service. The booths are a bit shallow and made me feel like  I was sitting in a high chair.The hood is  a bizarre subdevelopment in the middle of the urban core. It is however only a 3 minute drive from the edge of Lakewood. Way closer to my house than the Happy Dog. I can see myself coming back for food in the near future.

Sorry if this review seems very amateurish or perhaps even  robotic. I miss having an actual keyboard. Now I know why community college student newspapers are written at what seems to be a  fifth grade reading level. They must all be composed on smartphones."}
{"text":"The only reason I give this place one star is because I can't give it 0. The first thing I noticed upon walking in was the volume of the music; I understand that music in many bars is loud but this had to have been at least 80 Db (decibels), I had to yell just to talk with someone sitting at the same table. After a lengthy wait (15-20 minutes, even though there were only 10 people there) we finally got our food, for more then $10 per plate I was appalled at the low quality of the food. I got a southwestern chicken-sub which was o.k. but you could get better from Subway, my dad got a burger (also o.k.), and my mom got a pepperoni pizza. The pizza was...there are no words (that I could put in this review) to describe how bad it was, it had this fennel-esque licorice taste to it, as well as an odd hint of sweetness. My mom just thought \"How could you ruin a pizza?\" apparently, they found a way. P.S. The fries were string thin and mostly pepper, not good."}
{"text":"Reddstone double-charged my credit card for a dinner I had there -- and never responded to my multiple requests to fix the error. They didn't even offer the courtesy of a return phone call or email. American Express ended up crediting my account, but only after Reddstone ignored Amex's requests for information on what had happened. By the way, the service was fine but the food was only so-so. Reddstone is officially my least favorite restaurant in Northeast Ohio.

P.S. I've read reviews that refer to the owner of Reddstone as \"nice\" and \"friendly.\" Really? I beg to differ. I don't think it's very \"nice\" or \"friendly\" to simply blow off repeated requests by me AND American Express to correct a duplicate charge."}
{"text":"I have vague memories of this place, bittersweet. I arrived on a normal friday evening to grab a few drinks and a bite to eat. The food is pretty good, from what I remember anyways. 

I was with my gf at the time and my best bud, you guys know him simply as, PW, anyways some super drunk girl was on the prowl. She made her way, let me rephrase, she stumbled to each table that seemed suitable for her to flirt with whoever. The guy at the table next to us was with a beautiful woman, who stepped to use the ladies room, while away, this raging s*** walks up to him and flirts, he actually started flirting back (scumbag). Next she makes her way to my table and looks straight at me and starts flirting, it's so apparent I'm with my gf, why couldn't she hit on the single guy, furthermore, why hasn't my gf said anything by now?!!!

She was a badass P.R. girl and usually welcomed fights with open arms, I was shocked and jumped in and told her what I thought of her belligerent behavior. After spewing out more than a few profanities at her, she decided to throw a full glass of beer all over me. I was heated, instantly. 

The look on her face was priceless, it was blackout mode for me though, I can imagine the snarl on my grill, lol. I stood up and with lack of better judgement whipped my Heineken bottle in her direction and it busted in-between a very nice couple who were understanding of the situation. Everyone wanted her gone, she was a wreck!

In the end, our tab was on the house. Alls well that ends well."}
{"text":"Can I  say that I just LOVE this place! I had my husbands 30th birthday party here and it was just perfect! The staff was AMAZING. They were helpful and made my night less stressful. We had it inside the bar  area and my husband and his friends loved it. 
OK the food was so delish! My guests could not get enough and I can't wait to go back! Oh wait I am going tonight!! Oh yes you must have the\" my darling clementine\" cocktail too. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"We went for some birthday party action, up on the top floor. This place has been on my radar for a while after hearing several people telling me i need to go. We actually had a great time. I love that atmosphere inside. We didn't really hang downstairs. Our bartender was AWESOME! She went above and beyond for us, I did feel bad at some points she kept having to go downstairs for food and drinks. Speaking of drinks, i really like their menu. I discovered their magical Basil Berryade, which is amazing! I had a few of them! 

we eventually got hungry. We ordered some nachos and hong kong noodles. nachos came out piled high.  nachos were above average, but not to far, they did have a nice spicy kick to them. The hong kong noodles were horrible. I loved the concept; beef salty noodles and an egg. but they were sooo salty. I'm pretty sure they just cooked the noodles in full flavor soy sauce, which was then reduced even more. so pretty salty, and just about inedible. 

ill try 'em again. def taco night. love me some juicy taco."}
{"text":"This was a cool place. There's a patio area, an outside bar area, and you walk up stone stepping paths to tables and chairs outside, which are separated from each other by rocks and nature and trees and garden sculptures.

The wait time was dastardly when I went there. They were rightly past capacity on the orders they could handle, and I never got the thing that I ordered. I didn't mind though because I was preoccupied.

Right outside it's by the lake, and there are some nifty looking apartments and weird empty streets with fields of grass separating them. I thought I was in a secret area of a map."}
{"text":"So, I love this place. It's so unsuspecting. 

The bartenders rock. On one particular Friday night, we rocked out to 90's music the whole night. EVERY.SINGLE person in the bar was singing together. One of the best nights I've had in CLE with some of my best friends... nights like that are what's going to make me so homesick for this town when we head out west in a week. :( 

The food here rocks. But, be warned - the kitchen closes much earlier than the drinks stop flowing. Plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Seasonal favorite. Super cool, rustic patio is a great place to hang out on a warm night. Food is pretty good-pricey. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"This place looks pretty sketchy from the outside, and even when you go inside you are still second guessing your decision.  The patio outside is very nice, although you can only truly enjoy it for 3 months a year!  The food is exceptional - especially after your first impression of the décor.  I was there most recently on a Sunday to watch the Browns lose and I was once again blown away by the food.  I had some kind of stuffed pepper brunch dish with English muffins and sausage gravy...and I don't know what else but it was SO good.

The only thing that keeps Reddstone from 5 stores is the cramped interior."}
