{"text":"We came in and we had to sit ourselves, the waitress spotted us  and we waited 10 mins before we finally gave in and left. She took her time with the others and didnt bother acknowledging us. I cant comment on the food but the service was complete crap, no hostess no waitress."}

{"text":"Rien à redire contre ce resto. Je connaissais déjà la chaîne alors je savais à quoi m'attendre. La terrasse est quand même bien aménagée pour une terrasse dans un stationnement."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a colleague today.  His first reaction was \"do you want to go to East Side Mario's?\"  I mentioned Casey's had more to offer.  My order was a Thai salad with grilled chicken.  My colleague had some gi-noramus sandwich (which I forget the name).  We both left happy and satisfied.  Pricing is in the \"higher ballpark range\" however.  Expect around $20 for lunch with tip!"}
