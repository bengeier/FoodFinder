{"text":"We all know the saying \"Don't judge a book by its cover\", and that time and time again, this philosophy has been proven correct. Well I had this in mind on my first visit to Crepe it Up - the benefit of the doubt. The first thing I ordered here had been the Monster Crepe. It looked delicious even in my styrofoam takeout box. When I took the first bite however, I found the overriding flavour to be that of disappointment which lingered long after I had finished the crepe. 
Since then, I have been back, swayed by the kiosk's quaint aesthetics and by the  notion of being able to try something different while not having to wander too far. I have tried some of the sweet crepes and the chicken sandwich with a side of salad, which finally allowed me to come to a firm verdict about this place. The desserts are good, and will be something I come back for, however the savoury orders are definitely something to skip over. The ones I have tried were consistently sub par - all very mild in flavour and served with undercooked greens which crunched miserably when eaten by a subsequently equally miserable diner (i.e me). The sandwich in particular bothered me because, while eating, I was well aware that I could have ordered a better tasting, cheaper version of the chicken dish just around the corner at Tim Hortons, and that just didn't sit well with me. 
I just find that, while the prices on the menu seem fair in theory, they are a bit overpriced for what you end up with after paying. So if you're looking for a change in snacking cuisine, happen to be overtaken by your sweet tooth, and live in the area, then *maybe* check this place out. Otherwise, just take a pass."}
{"text":"My favourite breakfast place at St Lawrence Market. I usually get a savoury crepe with egg, broccoli, ham, and cheese. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait when a couple people have placed orders before you. But it's usually a good amount of time for me to go around the corner to get a cup of coffee, and then come back to grab my crepe."}
{"text":"Found this place via Narcity, and it's a great breakfast spot. I got the Eggs Benedict crepe, which was $6.50 plus tax and friend got the special, which was Nutella and banana. Smoked salmon was delicious, and I loved how the crepe was very crispy. It was decently filling as well. Downside is that there's no drinks sold here, so we went over to a nearby store to grab coffee. Seating is right behind the store, with benches and tables."}
{"text":"Easy snack/lunch in the lower level of the St. Lawrence Market.  

I like the sweet crepes best, but have also been known to get egg and cheese for a light lunch.  

Quick, tasty, made fresh to order.    There are a few stools at the counter, or take it away to any of the other tables scattered in/around the market."}
{"text":"Advertising gluten free crepes but called twice in two days and they were no available.  This is a real shame.  Two different staff members stirred the old gluten free mix on two different days and said the same thing \"would not have enough\"."}
{"text":"Relatively cheap crepe. I had a peanut butter pineapple crepe which is hot, soft, chewy and crispy on the edge. Expecting to try their savoury crepes next time!"}
{"text":"Shame. Shame. Shame. Take a look at my crepe, this is nothing but a crepe. It's Just some extra greasy batter cooked on pan. It's cheap, but don't waste money in it, especially when there is a lot of great places around. Never again"}
{"text":"The crepes here have the perfect amount of crispyness. Garlic seasoning here is also excellent. Very well-priced. Good service."}
{"text":"The one that I went to was the newest location, in Kensignton Market.

Comfortable seating but space is definitely limited. Staff is friendly and polite.

Crepes are standard, what you would expect, and at such a low price ($3.95 for crepe with 2 fillings, and around $4-6 for other signature crepes), it's a good quick fix. 

Ordered 2 savory crepes - the Peking Chicken ($4.50?) and Tuna Melt ($5.25) - be cautioned that the crepe batter itself is a bit sweet, which is a nice contrast to the savory fillings. 

My only disappointment is that although it claims to serve some \"organic mixed greens\" with savory crepes it did NOT happen with my 2 orders. My poor crepes looked a bit lonely on the plastic plate it was served on.

Although the taste was generally OK, it was a bit greasy. Can improve on that. Texture is pretty good, slightly chewy yet golden crisp on the edges, and it's freshly made.

I will come back again for their sweet crepes, which looks more promising on the menu."}
{"text":"Would not take my Entertainment.com coupon book coupon. NOT COOL. Lure you in with a BOGO then change the rules when you get there. Aren't there laws against that?"}
{"text":"Great tasting crepe. You can't go wrong with chocolate hazelnut spread and banana. All the fillings in the fridge including veggies and fruit look very fresh. 

I like how the edges of my crepe were slightly crispy while the rest of my crepe was soft and chewy. I'll give it 5 stars if my next visit is just as good."}
{"text":"alright savory crepes. I usually get the monster. If you're a tourist, don't go out of your way to come here though... I only eat here because it's near my work and sometimes I feel like having crepes."}
{"text":"My mother and I came here while looking around the market before it started to close and I'm so glad we did! As a mass consumer of crepes, I felt obligated to try the place out. The crepes we had were so good, and the people working there were friendly; they helpfully answered our questions! My mom liked it so much she stole some of my whipped cream from my crepe, and added it to hers. She struck more quickly than a viper, so I unfortunately couldn't take a photograph beforehand. I would love to come back again, so I definitely recommend giving it a try if you're in the mood for crepes."}
{"text":"It's pretty decent. I'd go back if I were close. 

Ordered the \"monster\" crepe, which actually is pretty stuffed with stuff. Cost just over $6, which seemed fairly reasonable. Wife had a tuna crepe, which she was happy with. Crepes were a little on the sweet side, which complemented the savory fillings well. 

We also got the side salads, which are $1.5 each. The spinach wasn't that good. The fruit consisted of a few pieces of banana and strawberry. Won't get either again. 

You can also get sweet crepes which are $3-$4 range. 

They DO take credit. Also, it is close to a quieter seating area where it is easier to get  table. Wait for the crepe wasn't too bad for a Saturday lunch, when the market was packed"}
{"text":"Delicious gluten free crepe! Not sure why they have to charge an extra $2.50 for gluten free but appreciated they had it."}
{"text":"Crepes pretty good with lots of choice - both savoury and sweet.  However, I wish they had coffee and other beverages at the St. Lawrence store."}
{"text":"Had the eggs benedict savoury crepe (egg, smoked salmon, spinach, mushroom with hollandaise sauce). I really liked the crepe texture and thickness, and it had a nice hint of sweetness to it. The fillings were good, but the smoked salmon tasted fishy. Next time would order one with different fillings. 

Friendly peeps behind the counter, and an overall pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Relatively cheap crepes. Just had lunch so was in the mood for a sweet crepe. Got the dark angel which is essentially a nutella crepe wrapped around 1 scoop of vanilla ice cream for 4.50. 

They make everything to order and the service is relatively friendly. The crepe itself has a nice consistency, just the right thinness and pairs well with the ice cream and nutella. It gets to be quite sweet though, but thats nutella for you. 

Overall, I would come back to try some of their savoury crepes."}
{"text":"A good lunch choice if you are near St Lawrence Market. I love their savoury crepes because of the price. Chicken with broccoli and cheese is my go-to. They are sufficiently sized to make you full. The best part is they are relatively cheap!

They also serve dessert crepes. Nutella, ice cream, fruit toppings. They have dessert crepe specials on Wednesdays/Thursdays.

Mostly for takeout, but they have a couple of stool seats located at the side of their booth. Also just behind their booth in the Market, are cafeteria style tables for you to sit and enjoy. Service is good but it can be a bit of a wait since lunch hour line ups."}
{"text":"Happened to pass by here for breakfast! I got the chocolate hazelnut with walnut crepe, and to my surprise it was just $5! Pretty cheap compared to other crepe places selling for $10 a crepe.

Took a while for the order to deliver because of the line up, but I was happy with the texture of the crepe. Unlike Cafe Crepe who crepes are thick and chewy, these crepes are thin and crispy on the edges. 

The hazelnut was actually part of the chocolate spread, mind you. I'm glad that I got real walnuts though-- they gave a nice crunch to contrast the soft gooeyness of the crepe. I was so hungry that didn't realize how hot the crepe was until I took my first bite and burnt my tongue. eugh.

Overall, decent food for a great price. Maybe I'll try the savoury or the ice cream rolled in crepe next time. I just have to remember the name of this place and not mix it up with Cafe crepes."}
{"text":"Located downstairs at the Lawrence Market so  it's easy to miss. 

Good creperie.  Enjoyed sharing the Vegetable Crepe and Apple Cinnamon Crepe. Crepes were prepared quickly and was really good eaten while still hot."}
{"text":"They make delicious crepes! Many to choose from.. both savory and sweet kinds available. Oh..and gluten free crepes!! A must for anyone visiting the St Lawrence Market."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  It's located in Gerrard Square upstairs.  It's kind of a fast food type place, and there is seating around the main kiosk.  The crepes are served on plastic/styrofoam plates.  There are sweet and savoury varieties.  It's only ok, nothing to write home about, but it's a nice option if you are looking for something sweet to eat."}
{"text":"Good crepes. We tried the Chocolate hazelnut with banana and vanilla ice cream. Works out to about $6. Not enough sitting, but hey, it's St. Lawrence market.
If the crepe is abit more crispy will be even better. But soft and chewy is still not bad.
Cafe Crepe will still be my first choice when it comes to crepes."}
{"text":"St Lawrence Market always completes my visits to Toronto.  It's a must stop for me for lunch and to pick up a few items for snacks throughout my trip.

My husband wanted to try Crepe It Up and we were both happy we did.  We shared a salmon, spinach and mushroom crepe.  Really tasty without being too fishy and the spinach was cooked until wilted."}
{"text":"Gerrard Square used to be a dirty, ghetto mall, but it is really shaping up.  It was really refreshing to see this little crepe place turn a part of the mall into a mini dessert cafe.  There's actually seats around the stand where people can sit, and it looks very nice.

This place has savoury crepes as well as sweet dessert crepes.  I had the Paris X crepe which had chocolate, banana and vanilla ice cream.  I shared the crepe with my cousin or else it would have been too much.  The prices are very reasonable too $3-$5 for a dessert crepe.  We both enjoyed  the crepe and agreed that the french vanilla ice cream was much better than we had expected.

The girls making the crepes don't seem nearly as talented as the crepe shop down at Queen St. W & John but they use the same techniques.  I'm very excited about this place and I know it's going to be a hit.  Good for G Square, they're finally getting something right."}
{"text":"Awesome crepes! Great varieties!! Wish they did lemon sugar crepes! But they had a whole bunch of savoury and sweet dessert crepes!! They shud do takeout crepes in a paper cone take away for easy eating!"}
{"text":"Crepe it Up's crepe definitely is NOT the best crepe I have in Toronoto... but it is decently good especially it is inside Gerrard Square. 

I would not say one bite I am in love and I felt like I am at a French cafe surrounded by goodlooking French waiters calling me \"Madam\".. But it is just the pick up I need... the sugary high I urgee when walking around Gerrard Square.

Chocolate and Hazelnut Crepe ($3.20)
- I found the crepe itself is a little heavy, a little doughy...
- at least it is freshly made... and warm and soft... (just like a French lover's kiss?)

The server, cashier and cook was a nice Chinese lady... but it is Gerrard Square.. No?"}
{"text":"We had the paris X, and it was a great dessert after all those salty sandwiches in St. Lawrence. It was around 2pm, and I saw one of the workers made a crepe for herself using the store's ingredient for lunch. For me, if you eat your own stuff, that's usually a good sign. The line was a bit long."}
