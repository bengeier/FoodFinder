{"text":"Just finished an omelet with potato, green chili and cheese. It was absolute delicious! Good service great food. This my new favorite breakfast."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe. Stopped in for lunch out of curiosity. Their fruit-infused ice teas are delicious. I had the mango madness. Had a BBQ chicken sandwich on wheat and it was tasty. The bread was awesome (homemade) and the chicken was tender. Had a cupcake for dessert, but kinda wish I got a cinnamon roll instead because I heard the other customers exclaiming about it. Lol. Staff are friendly and fast. Definitely will be back. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Eating at \"a Taste of Grace\" was an absolutely amazing experience! The owner, Jenny, was one of the nicest, most enthusiastic people I have ever met. And the food. Oh, the food! There were delicious french toast and delicious homemade rolls. We had a cinnamon roll... Oh, that was superb. All in all, a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Smells of good coffee. Their BLT is made to order as in they will cook up fresh bacon instead of pre cooked and the sourdough soooooo gooood. Support small business, especially this one they take care to make everything right all the way to a simple drip coffee. The care and work they put in shows through the food."}
