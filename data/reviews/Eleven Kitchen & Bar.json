{"text":"Long wait for mediocre, overpriced food $18 for a small burger with fries. House made ketchup is horrible and they don't have normal ketchup."}
{"text":"Great local beer on tap! Food is all made in house and no frozen pre made stuff. My daughter loves the cheese pizza. I like the beer and the in house made from scratch bacon!! Mmmm. Staff is friendly, attentive, and consistent. Everything we have tried has been great. For a hotel lounge/bar in the north near Skyview and harvest hills it's a great choice for after work or alternative to BP's that has zero local beer on tap."}
{"text":"OMG!! Best bacon ever nice thick slab smoked in house. Great in the club or Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"My spouse and I decided to stay at the Wyndham Garden Inn for our anniversary and thought we'd give Eleven a try. We were not disappointed.  The prices were a little high, but it's an airport hotel so we expected that.  They have a good selection of beer on tap and then have a comprehensive wine list and cocktail menu.  I tried their Joe's Second to One Ceasar, and it was Delicious, although it came garnished with a strip of their house smoked thick-cut bacon vs the Bocconccini cheese that was advertised. (note: bacon is never a disappointment).  I started with the heritage salad. It was delicious, and massive. It would have been nice to have the option of a half salad.  My spouse had the Pizza flight with 3 small pizzas. He tried the Canadian, American, and Moroccan. He enjoyed all 3 equally, and he mentioned that they're very unique and not your typical \"meat and Cheese normal pizza\".  I had the bacon mac and cheese as my entr√©e. It was very rich and delicious. I recommend it if you love bacon.  The service was great. The food was a bit slow to come out but I find people are too preoccupied with everything being fast. I found it fresh and worth the wait."}
{"text":"It's a shame that this restaurant is located where it is. It was very hard to find and was fairly empty. It was nicely decorated. But the staff wasn't very friendly, and I only had one glass of water the whole night because the waitress basically ignored us. That being said, I had the Mac n' cheese. It was so amazing. I have never had better, nor do I think I will. It was creamy, cheesy, bacon filled mouthfuls of heaven!"}
{"text":"For anyone staying at the Wyndham, I'd recommend giving this hotel restaurant a try. My family and I have different tastes but we all enjoyed dinner here. The taster pizzas (we tried italian, morroccan, and usa), beef tenderloin, and crispy salmon were all delicious. The spaghetti carbonara was a little too creamy for my taste, but that's a personal preference. Service was great, and even though the waitress said that the some of the entrees would take a little longer to prepare, I thought the wait time was totally reasonable. It helped that we had the pizzas as appetizers!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty much a hamburger and pizza kinda guy, so when I walked into this restaurant and saw the menu of really fancified food, I wasn't very hopeful. The prices scared me a little bit too, but mostly it was the very froufrou  nature of the menu. I was a bit of a captive audience, though, so I settled down and picked the dish that I thought I would hate the least: the roast chicken breast with lentils and beans.  And it was fantastic! Neither overspiced nor too bland, definitely not too dry, and just tasty in general. I left nothing on my plate. On the basis of that dish and the excellent service, I give this restaurant four stars.   Why not five? Mostly because I really do think, as a hotel restaurant that's in a slightly isolated area north of Calgary, they should probably be offering a broader menu. But I certainly can't complain about my own experience."}
{"text":"Expensive and lacklustre options. Very minimum options and really just nothing special. This is downtown pricing. And the service was bad. Over an hour for dinner to come to table. Happy hour until 6 and they didn't inform us nor did they come by to inform us of last call to see if we would like another drink before it ended. Decor was only nice thing about the joint."}
{"text":"No longer is business... Too bad!!  Excellent food, great beer, and the Caesars are out of this world ... OMG They are Great!! If your here, they are an absolute must try!!  I have been here a couple times and have never been disappointed.  They had a Jazz and Tapas night on Saturday night, what a great evening!!"}
