{"text":"Took my wife and kids after school and we all loved it. Best burger and fresh cut fries we have had in a while."}
{"text":"Super impressed! This place is a total 180 from 5 years ago. The bar atmosphere is great, huge TVs from all angles with good food to boot. Super glad to have a new hangout in town.

Update... Three things that came came to mind while eating here.
1. I wish the bar served drinks in glassware as apposed to plastic cups.
2. They'd sell a lot more drinks if they had a server work the room (as I was feeling to lazy to walk to the bar for a second drink)
3. They need deserts on there menu."}
{"text":"Woo Boy! That was not good. We stopped in at Fairway Grill tonight after mini-golf at Cool Springs. By the way, is $9/person expensive for mini-golf? Two kids under 10 and one adult, $27 was a surprise.
But the Fairway Grill, oof. We walked in and the waitress was pretty cheery and accommodated us when we requested a different table. The first one was in the sun and it was that bad evening angle. She even helped us move a chair. She took an immediate drink order, too, and brought those out in a few minutes.
Our waitress came by and was a bit harried. It seemed that all the tables had something wrong with their food. We should have lowered expectations at that point, but it was a beautiful night and I had totally schooled the kids on the course, so I was feeling good! 
It was happy hour with half-price appetizers, so we got the Bavarian Pretzel to start.  We ordered grilled cheese for the youngest and the kid's pizza for my daughter. I got the Pretzel Melt and my wife the Italian Melt (she joined us after mini-golf). The food took longer than expected, but not so long where you start looking around saying, \"Why is it taking so long?\" But I was almost there.
The pretzels were brought out by the hostess with cheese sauce. They were pretty good! Totally mediocre bar food that you would expect from a place like this.
My son's grilled cheese was not. It certainly wasn't \"grilled\" because that would indicate heat being applied at some point in the process and to call the two orange, unmelted squares \"cheese\" required a little imagination. The fries were decent, though.
The kid's pizza was cardboard with Campbell's tomato soup for sauce and a fair bit of bland mozzarella to make the name \"pizza\" seem true enough.
My Pretzel Melt was okay, but the waitress didn't bring the honey mustard that SHE SUGGESTED! The sandwich was dry and would have been passable with it, so I was bummed.
My wife won the night! The Italian Melt was \"fine\" with \"tasty meats\" (her words).
All in all, it was a disappointment.  The view of the driving range is fun, the patio seating is great, the service was uneven, and the food was sub-par (get it?)."}
{"text":"Definitely liked it. Service was good, draft list was pretty decent. Food is definitely better than average. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Horriable service. Food was good except son's grilled cheese which had one slice of unmelted kraft singles on huge italian bread.  I had to ask 3 times for a highchair and was finally brought a booster seat, then had to ask again. Waiter never checked to see if food was ok or if we needed anything. I had to get ketchup from another table."}
{"text":"Went there this evening with a Just Pay Half voucher.  They wouldn't honor the voucher.   Claimed that they couldn't verify redemption code with Just Pay Half.  Manager stated they had had problems with the company and recommended that I get a new code from Just Pay Half.  It was only $10 but now I have to try to get my money back from Just Pay Half.  Poor way to treat customers; will never go there again."}
{"text":"Love the patio view. Good variety of drinks. Very good pasta and pizza. My kids love it here and so do I. It is a good spot to bring a diverse aged group(grandparents and kids) because there is something for everyone here."}
{"text":"Long line waiting to sit with open tables then told us that everyone in are party had to be there and we Ended up leaving.  Last time we ate there we waited 45 min for food with a couple of full tables.  Food is ok bar food that is pricey.   Service has always been bad but didn't want to give bad review after one time.   4 out 5 the service was terrible and not to mention when talked to manager never tried to fix."}
{"text":"Awful....12 dollars for 3 shrimp cocktail....the italian hoagie was a cold sandwich with lunchmeat that was brown around the edges...the bun for the burger literally had butter dripping off of it....do not waste your money there"}
{"text":"Omelet was good. Toast was good. The only person interested in customer service was the nice guy making omelettes. Potatoes, sausage, bacon all old, greasy yet dry. Had probably been sitting there for hours. Fruit tasted overwhelmingly like onion. Inedible. Waitress argued with my husband about what he was drinking. Price decent."}
{"text":"I went to the Fairway Grill this week! There is a great patio overlooking the driving range! We sat inside next to the widow and still had an A+ view. The service was great! We had the create your own pasta which was amazing because I could pick all the stuff I liked!The party room also looks super fun! Garage doors so the party could open up on nice night! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Horrible,  this place was recently purchased again by another group. The food quality dropped tremendously. It used to be a great place for Sunday Breakfast with a small buffet for $10 including a juice, tea or coffee. Went there a few Sundays ago...and no more. The new menu was not done and they suggested the traditional breakfast special of 2 eggs, homefries and toast. Petrified potatoes...stale toast and we had to ask for everything...jelly, sugar, salt, pepper, ketchup....
Seems they want to change it to a Country Club Setting...good luck. I will not return. The draw is the families from the Rec Center...why try to build a better mouse trap? Go down the road a mile to Armstrongs...great food and fair prices, always consistantly good."}
{"text":"Terrible. Don't waste your money. I had a bagel that was microwaved and you couldn't even bite through. My husband had ice cold French toast."}
{"text":"Excellent place to watch the game. Wish I would have come here earlier in the year to take advantage of the outdoor patio. Damn oncoming winter. I digress. Good food, nice beer selection. A real live Happy Hour. Can't ask for much more. Cheers."}
{"text":"I had the same horrible service that several other reviewers reported. Sat in three different areas of the place trying to flag down a server, only to finally end up back at the bar. Drinks were adequate, food was uninspired. If you're already at Cool Springs to hit a bucket of balls, have a beer. Then go somewhere else for supper."}
{"text":"The only redeeming portion of my experience was the fresh cut french fries - and even a few of those were stale and cold, as though they mixed freshly cooked ones with older ones.  I had a hickory barbecue burger that was clearly \"grilled\" from a frozen patty, possibly from Sam's Club.  It was thin, overcooked, and dry - my first clue should have been the fact that the waitress didn't ask how I wanted it cooked.  

Which leads to the worst part of the experience, the service.  From the moment my group of five was seated, we felt like we were a burden to our waitress.  She seemed agitated by our questions about the drink specials, took far too long to get our waters, then walked off without taking even our drink orders - by then we were ready to order our meals.  When she did eventually return (we literally thought she'd forgotten about us), her attitude was poor, again making us feel like we were putting her out.  It was not a very busy night (a Tuesday at about 7pm), and she didn't seem to be overworked.

The waitress rarely checked on us, usually with a passing \"Everything okay?\"  Never once did she ask if anyone wanted another drink, and we had to ask her to refill our waters, which were all nearly empty - it seems like Waitressing 101 to me to at least make sure the guests' water glasses are full.

This was my first time at the Fairway Grille, so perhaps it was an off night, or that waitress had some personal issues, so there's a slight chance I would give it a second chance.  But based on this experience alone I would be hesitant to waste my time or money there."}
{"text":"The worst service ever.This was the first time I ever walked out. Waited 15 minutes for a waiter, finally went to the front counter and asked for help. A waiter come over,we ordered 2 beers. After 20 minutes no beers, and waiter never even looked our way. (Still had menus on our table.)We walked out,never to return."}
{"text":"beautiful warm feb day.  golfers hitting the tees, sports teams doing a lot inside, dining outside on the veranda for some.  very nice neighborhood type bar and grill.  limited menu (mainly bar type food) with good selection for what we wanted.  wrap type sandwiches for my sister and myself.  I had club, sister had some kind of chicken.  both more than adequate (we both took home 1/2).  Limited sides but you can sub for fries or their made-in-house (I assume) chips.  Daily specials listed on board at entrance.  Waitress very nice job and attentive.  Only downside I had was not offered mayo for my club (should have asked; my fault.  Management should read the reviews and comment (Or apologize in one bad review case) on them to show that they value the feedback."}
{"text":"Worst place ever.... Waited forever to get served, they weren't even busy. Then over heard workers talking shit on another worker. Don't go here. Eat before you come or after. Took forever to even get served for a single beer . Horrible service really.... Go somewhere else"}
{"text":"I hit a bucket of balls at the driving range and then stopped in for lunch. The wait staff was very friendly and personable. The atmosphere was chill and comfortable. The food was excellent. The beer selection was good and it included a keg of spoonwood brewed right up the road. The tap system is cool. It fills your beer from the bottom up. There's a magnet at the bottom of the cup to seal off the beer when it's done filling. It leaves less head than other tap systems.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area. Very very cool."}
{"text":"Service was fine on a busy Saturday evening. We did get there right as they started to fill up. The dining area is small to med sized with very comfortable seating and multiple big screens for sports. Wife had the grilled chicken salad and said it was fresh and tasty. My crispy chicken sandwich was delicious with a large portion of fresh cut fries that were yummy.
Kids had a hotdog, Italian hoagie and some garlic Parmesan wings. All were great. 

I heard that Chez Anthony recently acquired The Fairway Grille. 
Very good food, a little over priced for sports bar type menu. 

Would definitely recommend and we will be back!"}
{"text":"The new restaurant at cool springs is a much needed addition. The inside is clean, modern and bright. Granite/rock counters, large windows, gorgeous patio seating outside and a large bar. The menu is what you would expect it to be- burgers, pizzas, apps, salads. We tried out a salad and 4 meat pizza. The salad was great with dark greens, no iceberg here. The pizza was also very good with the exception of the crust which was obviously not homemade. The only downfall, in my opinion, is that you order at the counter and seat yourself. The line at the counter can be long and the tables fill up fast on busy days."}
{"text":"So, I've been here a few times mainly because it is so close to my house and it's just convenient. The space itself is very cool, it's open and brand new and when it's nice, you can sit outside and watch the golfers practice. The bar is nice and they have daily specials on drinks and the drafts have the new cool style system where the beer flows from the bottom to fill the cup without waste, if you haven't seen this yet, it is pretty cool.
The food is ok, typical bar food nothing really outstanding which is the one area where they could improve. If they had better food with something unique, they would be packed.
One great change is Mike, the bartender from dukes is working there now, so the bar will be busier and the conversation will be entertaining!"}
{"text":"Trying to be objective. The food was okay for price. Atmosphere was okay. Not enough staff, they seem overworked and trying their best but not to the level outstanding service. I really wanna like it but I was disappointed visit in general."}
{"text":"Was disappointed at this visit. Had been there a few years ago and it was quite good.
This time will be my last. Under staffed, order was incorrect when I received it. Waited 30 minutes from ordering to getting my meal. Being in such a busy and large people area, it would be to whom ever is in charge to staff properly and offer customer a good product."}
{"text":"Fresh cut fries are yummy!! Came here for lunch and got a fairway wrap with chicken... Really tasty"}
{"text":"Super friendly wait, bartender and support staff. Well-prepared, tasty food. Good view."}
{"text":"Will not be back.  Tried this place at least 10 times and almost always had some sort of issue.  Tonight was the capper.  

Had to wait for third choice of beer because they were out of the first two. Still got charged for beers we never received.  Not a huge deal until the food came out cold.  Overpriced cold crappy sandwich that was supposed to be hot.  Served with cold French fries.  

Asked them to put on the Penguins game on at least one tv and the response was \"we are having issues with the controllers \"????  We had the same response a few weeks ago.  

Wait staff always congregates together to talk rather than pay attention to the tables.  This has been the case ever since we began going there.  

Management doesn't care or some of these basic issues would have been resolved a long time ago.  

We are done giving chances.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"We decided to try the Fairway Grille on this freezing cold day because we were starving and we were curious to see the changes made to Cool Springs before Spring actually got here. 
I ordered the Steel Curtain burger. It has 1/2lb of beef, 2 slices of American Cheese, lettuce and the house sauce (think Big Mac sauce-only better.   It came with fresh cut fries and a pickle. The burger leaned more toward well done than the medium that I ordered but it was very tasty. I ended up eating only half because between the burger and fries it was a lot of food. 
My hubby ordered the Garlic Parm wings. They were hot and crispy with tons of fresh garlic. They were served with a homemade Ranch Dressing and celery. I'm not a huge fan of Ranch dressing but the Ranch dressing here was excellent. 
My youngest son ordered a hot dog and fries. His hot dog came with grill marks. Yum!
My oldest son ordered the fish hoagie. It was THE biggest fish sandwich I have ever seen. It was served with tarter sauce. I believe it is house made also. The fishy was crunchy on the outside and light and flaky on the inside. It also came with fries. 
We were the first ones in the restaurant today but little by little people started coming in. Most of them had been in before. We will definitely be back. There are still wraps, salads, and pizza to try.  The service is outstanding!!"}
{"text":"We stopped last night for drinks and dinner. We sat outside and though the view was nice, the tables were comfortable and it was a great way to enjoy the weather. The drinks were reasonably priced, but the food seems really expensive and really disappointing. The cheese sticks weren't cooked long enough so were really mushy and had a weird texture. The breadsticks were soft and chewy, but they had a really weird chemical aftertaste. The weirdest part were the inconsistencies between the marinara dipping sauce brought with both. We were warned that the breadsticks had new sauce that was just heated up so would be hot. This explained why the mozzarella marinara was a weird dark color and liquid less. It was the consistency of mashed potatoes instead of a sauce. For the cost of eating there, I'd expect the food to be better. We would return if we had nowhere else to go, but it won't be somewhere we choose."}
{"text":"Nice area with an outdoor deck.  Friendly service.  Only ordered some Chip and Dip from the Fore D'Oeuvres and had a drink but looks like a nice place for some pub grub after hitting some golf balls.  I think they had 4 or 5 beers on tap.  The menu is on a large TV and of course some hand menu's.  Will have to stop back and grab some lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for the first time... it was great!!!! Abby was our bartender, she was sweet, knowledgeable, accommodating and fast. We only had the wings and potato skins as an app. The wings were crispy and yummy! 
The crowd was a bit older but still enjoyable. It seems like you could come here having fun with friends or with your family."}
{"text":"First time here and I am in love with this establishment. I am one that loves a good ambiance, music and good food. The service was phenomenal and all of their workers were very attentive and made sure my party and I had a great time. Although I do not live in the immediate area, I will most certainly be back. Also, the band that were singing was phenomenal. If you want to hear great music, come out every 3rd Saturday for a great treat."}
{"text":"New management. Terrible menu, raised prices, food was cold. Presentation was uninspired, waited entirely too long for meal, food served on dirty black plastic plates, portions were tiny and not good. We gave them two more chances but this most recent visit today was unacceptable. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with some friends. It is located at Cool Springs miniature golf and driving range. It has been so long since I visited Cool Springs that I didn't even know they had a restaurant and bar.

The group was seated at a round table overlooking the driving range. We had just had our first snowfall so it gave the view an nice wintry feel about it. There is outdoor dining available since I had noticed patio chairs and tables.

We had a very attentive waitress. The menu does give a vast assortment ranging from Reuben  and Rachel sandwiches to burgers, salads, and pizza. Today's special was opened faced turkey Devonshire but I also noticed that you can purchase 1/2 sandwich during the lunch hours for about $7.50 and still get a side of fries or chips.

One of the ladies in our group treated us to an appetizer of mozzarella sticks and breaded chicken with two different dipping sauces. These were very good. Everyone in the group ordered something different. I decided to try the strawberry pretzel salad with a slight up-charge for chicken  The pretzels in the salad are the thick bites but they do give you a huge salad! I asked the lady who ordered the Reuben how she liked it and she told me it was good. 

Most of the sandwiches came with a lot of French fries so my advice would be to come hungry. They have two huge flat screen TVs facing each other from where we were seated so when the Steeler came on it was a bit hard to hear my group because they turned the volume up. One of them is located in the bar area.

This will become another one of my go to spots since I frequent the South hills often. Am anxious to try other things on their menu. Everything looked good and ample parking is available."}
{"text":"This place lost our business. We tried making a reservation for 12 and wanted to use the private party room. Called several different times over a few days and each time we were told the person in charge of events would contact us by phone/email to set this up for us. We never heard back from anyone. What horrible customer service! If the room was already booked (don't know if that was the case) they should have called back to let us know. We took our business elsewhere and definitely won't try going back."}
