{"text":"I've had sushi all over the city and this is my favourite place.  The quality and portions are great.  I recommend the spicy salmon and california rolls."}
{"text":"Great sushi rolls here. Not the best in Toronto, but definitely enjoyable. Service is friendly. This is a really small, predominantly take-out restaurants, with maybe 3 stools at a counter for eating-in.   I love the rice to fish ratio at Kokoro. There's not very much rice, and lots of filling! I like this place a lot better than the other sushi restaurant down the street (Oyshi), as it tastes fresher and much better priced.   Note that they are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"So close to where I live and they got both the taste and the price! The black and green dragon rolls were awesome!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good, quick, and reasonably-priced takeout spot - this is the one!  This is BY FAR the best sushi spot in the Toronto downtown core (with the exception of some fancier spots, but those are on a completely different price range any way). I find myself grabbing lunch from here almost every week, and have never been disappointed.  The menu is quite minimalistic (probably why they are so quick), and everything is well-made and delicious. I always find myself ordering one of the roll combos which are delicious and quite filling.     And for all you credit card loyalists: they only accept cash and debit (over $8)."}
{"text":"I order from here 2-3 times a month and I love them.  The rice to filling ratio in the rolls is minimal, which is just how I like it!  I have never been disappointing with the flavour/freshness and it's always ready quickly!   I do wish they accepted credit card though."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh sushi! It's a great takeout spot when you want to grab a quick, healthy lunch / supper. My definite go-to when I've got a craving for sushi!"}
{"text":"This is a great hole in the wall sushi take-out place I was introduced to by a friend who lives close by. Yesterday was my second visit there. We had been there before so I knew about the Kokoro combo board which is not part of the menu uploaded online. Ordering for two, we got the Kokoro combo 1 : 6 pieces of sushi, 6 california & 6 spicy salmon for $11.95 and Kokoro combo 4 which was 10 pieces of dynamite roll and 6 spicy salmon for $11.95 aswell. Both servings were large, and the fish was quite fresh. I found the tempura bits in the spicy salmon to be a little soggy, which is why I took off one star. We also got the spicy ginger dip for an additional 50 cents - if you like spicy food you're in for a treat. There's also free green tea available inside. For the price and neighbourhood, this is a place I would unequivocally recommend."}
{"text":"I came to this place not expecting much, but I definitely was surprised! The vegetarian selection was quite good, and the waiters were all very friendly. The one male waiter wasn't able to tell me what was in one of the lunch combos, but he got the woman to come and answer my question. She was very nice and helpful, and our meals came very fast!   The price was good, the food was good, and the service was good. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"so far, the best sushi in the city. could take stars away because it is only take out, but so damn good. i only have had maki etc not sure about any other dishes they have.  but really, get sushi go to sugar beach and enjoy the sunset."}
{"text":"Great take out sushi for a reasonable price! Their spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls were actually spicy and tasteful, unlike many of the spicy tuna/salmon rolls I've had at other sushi restaurants. Great sushi, good price, quick service."}
{"text":"4/5! Much better than Sushi Shop. Cheap & good. The salmon is fresh! Small place so good for take-out only. Will definitely continue to go back!"}
{"text":"I love the spicy salmon roll! The service is quick and friendly. We come here all the time!"}
{"text":"They do not take American Debit or Credit Cards in any way shape or form. They have an ATM on site, but it also did not take US cards."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  I am a big sushi eater and this is by far one of the best places I have been to!  The staff are really nice and one of the girls there knows me by name (I frequent probably once a week).  I call to place my order, as soon as I do I walk over and my order is always ready for me when I get there.  The complimentary green tea is a plus for me.  Friendly staff, great service, and great tasting sushi."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Toronto and I've tried a few places. I work near here and go to Kokoro at least once a week, that one day makes my whole week.  Very friendly staff. Don't miss the spicy salmon."}
{"text":"My friends just moved into the area and I was curious about this place. Before I had decided to go though, I checked on Yelp to see if there were any positive reviews about the place. Since there was, I decided to give it a try since my friend owed me a dinner. Thankfully, I didn't have to pay for this meal because I didn't enjoy it at all.  We both ordered bento boxes. He had salmon teriyaki and I had chicken. The server (although friendly) ended up giving us both the salmon teriyaki bento box even though I had ordered chicken. I understand if the server/kitchen would get it mixed up had the restaurant been busy but there asides the table I was sitting at, there was only another table of 4 beside us. There should be no mix up. The good part was that she quickly went back in the kitchen and had the chicken for me ready in no time.  The overally quality of the food was just not great for me. The taste of teriyaki chicken was something that I can make myself at home but even better. The spring roll that came with the bento box just disgust me - one bite was more than enough. The sushi was passable (tastes good enough to swallow).   Unless my meal was paid for, I won't be going to Kokoro again. The only redeeming factor about the place is that the staff is nice and the prices are very very cheap.  I also didn't understand why the dine-in menu is a take out menu either...."}
{"text":"As much as I appreciate how fast the service is and the price being pretty good - I find that the taste is average. I find that the quality could be better given some older places that do well and a new place that has popped up nearby - but I guess if you are looking for food on the go then this is your place to go to. I will go here again but probably not if treating guests."}
{"text":"I got EXTREMELY ill with food poisoning after I ate the scallop handroll and the Alaska roll. Safe to say that I will NOT be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Great quality and a fair price for fast takeout sushi! The fish to rice ratio is perfect. The menu is somewhat limited with respect to your options, but all your classic rolls are there. And surprisingly they did not skimp on the sashimi portions.  They are very quick to prepare your order, I usually arrive 15-20 minutes after calling and have only had to wait for my food once when they were unusually busy.  Beware... The spicy salmon rolls are REALLY spicy. I couldn't finish mine, but I am a wuss for anything beyond mild heat."}
{"text":"Awesome neighborhood take out japanese restaurant that is fast and affordable! Their daily special take out menu is usually the best value. Sushi comes out in neat bento packaging. Service is also fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Toronto. Fantastic prices. No BS menu, just the good stuff."}
{"text":"I live nearby and this is a good option for sushi if you want some quick take out. Prices are reasonable and they are quick and cheerful.   My only gripe is that they tend to use a lot of sweet potato as filler in their rolls.  Example, the salmon mixture in the spicy salmon roll has lots of sweet potato and tempura flakes mixed in."}
{"text":"I feel guilty for giving Kokoro 2.5 to three stars... because I like the people who work here. We order a fair number of platters from Kokoro for staff events. These feed about 15-20 people and cost around $100. That is actually a great deal... less than $10 per person and the platter can be prepared quickly without much warning.   The quality is ok; one or two steps up from food court sushi. The fish is fresh but bland. The offering is standard: California rolls, salmon and tuna (rolls, maki and nigiri), cucumber rolls, tempura rolls, and sometimes scallop nigiri. Great for events where people don't want to explore new things.  Solid. Standard. Nothing tastes unique. Maybe because we are always ordering the platter we are missing something special...  The shop itself reminds me a bit of a pizza place where you walk in, pay at the counter, get your sushi platter, and leave."}
{"text":"I am a sushi lover and grew up eating sushi in Japan.  Quality of sushi here is not the greatest and the rolls are not very creative.  Not sure if the rolls are pre-made but the nori gets extremely chewy - this has happened to me on 3 different occasions.  As another reviewer mentioned, it's roughly 1-2 steps above food court sushi.  I would suggest heading over literally across the street to Oyshi Sushi where the sushi is fresher and where the have uni."}
{"text":"This tiny takeout joint under the Pinnacle Towers at Yonge and Harbour is one of the best sushi joints in the city. The ingredients are very fresh and once you start eating here, other places pale in comparison. They even make their own soy sauce and have the uncoloured ginger! I would recommend trying the Red, Black and Green Dragon rolls. They also have various combos which work out to be more economical. The staff is very friendly and treat you well. However, be careful, you might end up spending $30-$40/ week on sushi as it is that darn good."}
{"text":"Still good, but not as good. =(  Sadly, I have to remove one of my stars from my rating of Kokoro.  Since I wrote my first review, the quality has gone down.  The cucumbers are not as fresh and crispy, the avocado is sometimes too mushy, the asparagus (for the tempura) is sometimes too old and fibrous, and the tempura itself is no longer as fresh.  I think that either the oil is old and over-used or the tempura coating is a little stale at times.  Overall it is still one of the tastiest, but not as consistent as it used to be."}
{"text":"Kokoro Sushi offers great quality sushi at a reasonable price in an area where there aren't a lot of restaurants. Great lunch spot"}
{"text":"This is a take out place as they do not have any tables to sit at.  Only 1-2 stools along the window.  Price wise it is very good for Downtown Toronto but the quality is average. Not much to like or hate about this place just know it is what you pay for.  Average 3 stars that will fill you up without losing an arm.  Will come back for more sushi when I am close by.  Another thing is that this place when they say Spicy they mean it is spicy. I never had such spicy salmon roll before until now. It is good but they didn't give you any water/tea with your take out so you gotta run to the closest place to look for a drink.  Mind me as I cannot handle the spice to well so other people will have no problem.  The other thing I do not like is that they put Sweet Potatoes in their Dynamite roll which is odd.  Only Cash and debit."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I have to say that I was impressed both times. Kokoro is a small takeout space (with a few spots inside and a couple of outside seats) that serves up some pretty good sushi at very reasonable prices.   I ordered two combos from them this past weekend, and the order was ready within minutes. The sushi rolls were a good size, and the sashimi was fresh and tasty. The price was fantastic as well. The highlight was the spicy salmon roll, as many others here have mentioned. It's probably the best I've had in this city, with a good amount of kick, which means serious flavour. Really enjoyable. They are quite busy though, lots of people kept coming in to order takeout or to pick up. But the wait time was next to nothing, so I'm thoroughly impressed. Don't look any further for good, affordable sushi in this area."}
{"text":"After reading all the good reviews for this take out place I was intrigued and really wanted to try it out as my fav take out place is up town. Another reason being this place being a stone's through from home. I walked in around 5:30 and they did have a mini line up of people ordering items and constant barrage of call in orders. A good sign in my opinion. I opted to order the 8&8 as they call it (8 Pieces of sushi and 8 Pieces of sashimi) I have an appetite for sushi/sahimi so I ordered a spicy tuna roll for good measures. This place is kinda pricey for a take out as the total was 19$ (11.95 for 8&8 and 4.95 for spicy tuna) but hey good sushi/sashimi is expensive. The turnover was surprisingly quick as my order was ready in 10 min despite them being a bit busy. They do have some tables outside now and a small counter inside so you can technically eat there if you want. Pity is they don't have LLBO licence so it doesn't work for me. I had my Sapporo cooling in the fridge along with the frozen mug in the freezer :D   The presentation is quite nice as evident from the pics. Most of sashimi and sushi items were Salmon as expected with a single piece of Tuna thrown in for sushi. A surprising item on sashimi was Tuna Belly which is a cherished and albeit rare item here in TO. The fish was fresh and sushi was OK. Not amazing as rice for nigiri was dry. The Spicy tuna was not so spicy (Elvis likes his Tuna Spicy a'la Seinfeld!George liking his Kung Pao Spicy) I think their quality is equal to mid level sushi places in TO. 3 Stars overall. I will try their other combos if I need a quick  fix in this area."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic value. $15 after tax on a combo 7 plus miso soup gets you a roll, and a good amount of assorted sushi. For those living in Toronto's low interest rate induced glass towers by the water, this is the go to pick-up (btw there is no seating) sushi spot."}
{"text":"Wow, what a pleasant surprise. After hearing lot's of good things from people who live in nearby condo's, we ordered some take-out for a group at the office. Good quality sushi / sashimi at a low price... but with limited selection.    Take-out is the only real option as there is no real seating. Some small tables outside in the summer but thats it. Not very practical if you want to eat out but probably a good idea for the condo crowd. Food was ready quickly and the call ahead order process worked well.   We ordered multiple combos to share and many of the stand alone rolls. I found pricing to be on the lower end - especially for the downtown core.   The sushi was pretty good and given the lower price level, it makes for a great value proposition.  I was a little disappointed with the variety, but what they do have, they do well. It doesn't make my top sushi list but that's OK since it also costs much less.    The sushi & sashimi was very fresh and the portions were generous. I think the sushi actually had too much rice but that's a minor complaint. The spicy tuna rolls were excellent and I really liked the spicy sauce. Those in the know ordered extra spicy sauce to use on other rolls.   The base combos only include the basics -  Salmon, Ebi, White & Red Tuna and either california rolls or spicy tuna rolls. You get more salmon than anything else.  A good option if you live downtown and want takeout but just not practical if you want the total dining experience.   BK"}
{"text":"The sushi here is great for its cheap price. The quick service is also a plus.   The only downside is that this place is a take out restaurant. It would be great if seating is available for costumers."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a quick meal if you're in the area. Gotta say I'm surprised anyone would rate this place at more than three stars."}
{"text":"I dont understand people that rate this place more than 2 stars. I'd go elsewhere unless you're drunk and just want some food."}
{"text":"This place has been bought by a chain: Kibo Sushi. More volume but less quality for the same price now. I still go from time to time, but the dynamite roll just isn't the same."}
{"text":"Yep this place rocks, and they're super easy on the carbs for those fitness buffs!!! Get there!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to get something quick to eat. We chose Kokoro because it was within walking distance from our hotel. Thanks Yelpers for the recommendation!  We really enjoyed the Tuna Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll and Dynamite Roll. Fish was fresh and they weren't skimpy on the fillings.  The only disappointment was the California Handroll. It didn't have much flavor."}
{"text":"A good \"fast food\" type sushi place, definitely more for rolls and take out. The gyoza for some reason was deep-fried but my boyfriend loved it. The maki was OK and I will probably come back because I live nearby. Great in a pinch but wouldn't go out of my way to get here.   Limited seasonal outdoor seating only."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten a lot of sushi in Toronto (I only come occasionally), and I've generally been spoiled by eating a lot of sushi in Japan.    So why give Kokoro 4 stars?    Because it's excellent - both in terms of value and taste - for what it is.    It's not on par with great sushi in Japan, but I wouldn't really expect somewhere in Toronto to be great - particularly not for the inexpensive prices Kokoro charges.    That sounds (even to me) like I'm trying to justify why I liked Kokoro, but honestly, it's more about knowing what to expect, particularly for sushi.  Great sushi-quality fish is expensive in North America, so when I get very good sushi at a very good price (like at Kokoro), I'm always impressed.  We had exclusively rolls (salmon, tuna, rainbow, etc.), since I usually need to trust somewhere a bit more before I get much nigiri.  And every roll was very good.    I particularly like that Kokoro does NOT offer a huge selection, because I find that to often be the downfall of a place like this.  Kokoro sticks to a few selections of fish, all of which are fairly fresh.  And the fish-to-rice ratio is very good.    Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Very decent sushi place. I didn't order a lot from there but it was delicious. I got take out because I live close by but they do have a pretty decent dining area. The lady that served me was really friendly as we discussed fashion and shopping. I plan on going back again."}
{"text":"Love this place - it is takeout only but in the summer time they keep some patio furniture outside to sit and eat   Their prices are quite reasonable but even more so if you get one of their cash specials!   Tasty fresh and lots of variety"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for great takeout that is near lakeshore and yonge st."}
{"text":"I'm not even a big sushi fan and I'm here at least once a week. That's gotta mean something, right?  Very friendly staff, awesome miso soup, free green tea, omnomnom."}
{"text":"Great prices for awesome sushi. Very fast service only needing ten minutes between calling and pickup."}
{"text":"Great little place! I was in town for a conference, staying in a hotel nearby, and just wanted a light, easy dinner. Found this place on Yelp and am glad I have it a shot! Tasty, fresh fish and the perfect amount of rice in the rolls."}
{"text":"What a great find! This is a no-frills sushi place that is great for take-out. As others have said, you can pull up a seat at the window bar seating inside or the couple of tables outside if you'd like. We opted to get the food to go, and then went and found a table near the Hockey Hall of Fame just for sheer convenience to us. I ordered the Philadelphia Roll which also had avocado inside (yum!) and a California roll. It was PLENTY of food! It tasted fresh and the rolls were generous in size. My husband ordered gyoza and a rainbow roll. He agreed that the fish was fresh and the gyoza was so good! If we end up back in Toronto, we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place was just fine. I went on a Friday night for a quick dinner with a couple of friends before a party we were going to hit up. They had bento boxes which were huge and neither were able to finish. I got a sushi combo that was about $10 for a california roll, 5 pieces of assorted sushi, soup, and salad. They brought tea which was nice. Added touches like that which I don't have to pay for score major points with me. The sushi was all tasty. It was pretty average, but nothing wrong with it at all. If anything the toppings were too thick for my tastes (too many years as a vegetarian, I often enjoy those paper thin slices from cheap places everyone else hates so much). The place was pretty quiet which surprised me. It has good food, reasonable prices, and is in a neighbourhood with only crappy competition, I hope more people get a chance to check it out. I'd go back if in the area but probably wouldn't go out of my too often for this place."}
{"text":"Came here before a Raptors game - it's about a 5min walk from the ACC.  Kokoro Sushi is lit.  We ordered a Kokoro 2 (6pcs sushi + 10pcs dynamite roll - $12.95) and a Black Dragon Roll (10pcs - $12.95).  Both rolls were huge - like Sushi Bong huge aka so big that it breaks apart huge.  There are only around 4 bar stools in this place because it's tiny, but they sufficed.  Also, the lady owner was nice and they have a tea dispenser which you can help yourself to.  Def. visit this place if you're in the area and want some cheap sushi."}
{"text":"It's very simple.  I love this place.   Kokoro is a small take-out sushi joint.  It's true that their menu is somewhat small and the fish selection isn't as vast as other sushi restaurants that you can sit down and have a meal at, but the fish is always fresh and the sushi is always prepared excellently.  (Note: There is a small table near the window that can maybe seat 3.  This is really a takeout place, and it's not recommended for eating in.)  In addition to the freshness and tastiness, the prices are really quite good.  Your standard rolls tend to range between $3 and $5.  The real deals are in their sushi combos and 8/8 combo (8 pieces of sushi, 8 pieces of sashimi).  Lastly the service is always speedy.  The folks that run this place know how to do it right.  I've never had takeout sushi anywhere near this good, and I'd say Kokoro's sushi even surpasses most sit-down mid to upscale sushi restaurants in Toronto.  Bottom line - try it.  It's fantastic."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've had in Toronto. You won't be disappointed. Quick service and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! The Dynamite is especially good... they make it with sweet potatoes ... mmmm!  But there is not place to sit, so you gotta have it for take out"}
{"text":"Yelped to find a close place for dinner without breaking the bank (Saving Miku for a special occasion..or when I save enough money to enjoy a meal) and we found this place! Located underneath a condo building, Kokoro is a small sushi shop primarily for takeout; think the Sushi Bong of the downtown core.   The shop itself has a long bar table, with 4 high chairs. We were greeted by the owners when we walked in and took a look at their menu. BF and I decided to get the Chicago roll, BC Roll and Spicy California Roll. The Chicago roll was my fave as the yam was crispy and very filling. Fair warning to those who underestimate the spice level of the Spicy menu -- these rolls were layered with hot hot heat!  For ~$15 pp the boyfriend and I walked (or rolled) out of the shop with our bellies full. Will be back if I decide to walk around Harbourfront again, maybe more Pokemon hunting this summer?   Cash or debit."}
{"text":"Cash only and the quality is not always the same. Chicken teriyaki roll tends to be dry, microwaved chicken(?)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab takeout sushi. Prices are pretty reasonable $10-$15 for a teriyaki and most rolls are around $10 or less. The location is very convenient for where I live, and the service is friendly enough and efficient. The sushi itself tastes pretty average, better than supermarket ones for sure but on par with nicer restaurants. Again a great option for some quick takeout, and I will certainly return."}
{"text":"I usually go to Oyshi Sushi just a few steps away but it was a busy Friday lunch rush and I hadn't thought to call ahead to place my order so I decided to give Kokoro a try instead. My quick take:   Pluses - The service is fast and friendly and the fact that it's (slightly) cheaper than Oyshi, whose prices reflect more of a sit-down place anyways.   Cons - It's just not anywhere near as good. The miso soup was loaded with way too much seaweed, some weird things that I picked out and assumed were little mushrooms (I hate mushrooms) and not enough miso-y goodness; that is to say it was a tad watery. The Vegetarian futomaki was fairly blah with some odd choices (red pepper? really?) in the roll.   As a vegetarian I'm aware that my sample size is admittedly small but I can certainly compare to what I've had elsewhere. If Kokoro were the only sushi place within walking distance to my office I might consider it again. All things being equal though I think next time I'll just make sure to call ahead when ordering at Oyshi."}
{"text":"Le temps dattente entre le moment detre assis et de voir notre serveuse etait long mais apres ce detail le service est impeccable et la nourriture est genial. Je recommende le Dragon Eye vraimemt succulent."}
{"text":"I had Kokoro deliver and was not impressed. For me what makes or breaks a sushi place is often the sushi pizza, and theres was nothing to write home about. The sushi pizza was bits of chopped up salmon atop a crispy thin rice patty with may and sprinkled tempura flakes. WAY to much grease and fried-ness for my liking."}
{"text":"Great sushi for a reasonable price in an excellent location. Maki trio is quite a deal."}
{"text":"Tiny place with delicious sushi at a great price! I tried \"Combo C\" and I loved the variety in rolls. It can get quite busy during lunch time on weekdays because there are some businesses located near by so be prepared to wait and bring your patience! They are quite fast at getting your order out but lining up to order will take time."}
{"text":"Love Kokoro sushi! It's the kind of sushi place that converts non-sushi lovers. Nothing too crazy, super tasty. The spicy salmon roll is my favourite."}
{"text":"Best take out sushi place in toronto! Quality has been pretty consistent . It's no japango or sushi couture, but it's definitely prett good for the price. Convenient for those who live around the area too"}
{"text":"Got some take out here last Friday - ordered the Roll Combo B - 6 California rolls, 6 spicy tuna rolls and 6 spicy salmon rolls for $13.50 taxes in.   The portions were big, but the spicy rolls mostly had crushed tempura batter. Could barely taste the salmon or the tuna.   Another complaint was that the sushi was starting to break down immediately once dipped in soy sauce.  Would I be back again? Probably since its just a quick walk from my office. Only if I'm desperate for sushi ... price is realizonable for downtown"}
{"text":"Always had consistent sushi at this location and they have wonderful party trays for quick and easy entertaining.  Always fresh, and always affordable.  Pre order thier sushi for a quick lunch, and their tempura is the bomb....:) yummy!   They have a little patio seating in the summer, and bench seating in the take out spot...all good, usually go back to the office with my take out anyways.  Friendly staff, and not too sure why everyone is giving the bad reviews.  I've been going here for the past 4 years, always good.    I'm always suspect when people talk about food poisoning as well, as I've been to some REALLY sketchy places, and this is not one of them.  Miso soup, is always yummy with enoki mushrooms, lots of seaweed, and tofu...it actually has flavor unlike other places with just a dash of miso powder, and hot water, so don't know what Michael M was refering to? Anyways, give it a try.."}
{"text":"Service was amazing and the owner was super nice and attentive, made sure we were satisfied and everything was good. Absolutely delighthful experience."}
{"text":"ok. going to review this place again since I've tried it a few more times since my first time.   what can I say? the food options around here are scarce and its either here or 4 other less than desirable eateries.   first, do not get anything fried. that was what I had last time, spicy salmon, dynamite... and it was not good at all.   however after going with rolls like simple tuna/avocado and salmon, it's decent. for the price point. it's a good deal and 10 bucks can get you a good meal."}
{"text":"In my opinion: one of the best sushi places in the city.  Good quality fish, well-sized portions, reasonably priced and really friendly staff.  I believe there is a small area to dine in but it's more geared for carryout.  I've never eaten anything I didn't like there but I would highly recommend the spicy salmon handroll and the rainbow roll - so, so, so delectable!"}
{"text":"The Harbourfront/Union station area doesn't have a lot of good food options, so Kokoro is a pleasant surprise. It's a takeout place, although there are a few tables set up just outside. I would suggest just getting your order to go and finding a nice spot by the lake for a picnic!  The Korean owners are very cheerful. They'll make your order pretty quickly, but if you want to be super-efficient, you can phone in your order in advance. They have some great sushi roll combos, ~18 pieces for $11-14 depending on the combo. Rolls are fresh and have a good fish to rice ratio (not overloaded with rice like at some other budget sushi joints). You can sip free green tea while you wait.  They also sell desserts like mochi and red bean ice cream."}
{"text":"I'm a huge sushi fan and this is one of the best sushi places in Toronto! Do not be deterred by the takeout option only! The sushimi is incredibly fresh, the portions are generous and the sushi pizza is amazing. All the food is prepared to order, hence is always super fresh.  The service is very quick, they will get your order ready in record time, no matter how big it is. I've never waited for longer than 10 mins (I usually call ahead and go pick it up). The employees are very nice and polite.  I've been going to the place for about a yr and a half (ever since I've moved to the area) and all my experiences have been nothing but great!   The prices are lower than most places too (probably passing on the cost savings of being a takeout only place).  They are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Have been going there for over five years, used to work in the area and it was my go to for sushi lunch.  Still go there when I'm in the area, Combo B is my order.   Any spicy rolls there will not disappoint :)"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious: fish, fried foods, cocktails, dessert! Must orders are lobster salad and matcha panna cotta. Service is delightful! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I looked around... I Wanted to be VERY careful with regards to who would be my 100th post on Yelp.... and I've only been here once but I feel they deserve my 100th.  I ordered some sushi, and there was something I did not like about it....so I went back to the counter and let the lady know, I only expected that role to be redone but she actually remade my entire order.   Was I unhappy? No accidents happen...the follow up is what matters and thats why I think Kokoro deserved my 100th review!  I've always said, food thats medicore becomes AMAZING with the right service.  AMAZING food will never be good with bad service, so I feel this was amazing service which made my time much better and will 100% result in my money being spent here.   Great customer service, and good food :)"}
{"text":"One of the best value and taste for lunch sushi. They are quick and make it quality. Worthy of a try for sure. kokoro combos are the way to go."}
{"text":"You would be crazy to not go KOKO over Kokoro Sushi!  This is probably one of my top 5 places to go for sushi in Toronto. Whenever I am in the area studying with friends, I always pass by to grab a box. It usually comes out to around $10-15 and the portions are large enough to feed 2 people.   I highly recommend getting the spicy salmon and the dynamite rolls. The spicy salmon rolls makes your lips swell up like Jay-Z and the dynamite rolls are stuffed with sweet potato that just make you want to give every farmer a hug. Really good sushi at a really good value!"}
{"text":"This is my dependable go-to spot in the area. Always fast, friendly, and fresh. I love the Dynamite rolls!"}
{"text":"They used to be much better. They are still ok if you are in need for a quick sushi fix on a late night after work. I found that the tempura based rolls were served warm which I really liked. It seems now when I order, it is cold in terms of temperature meaning the tempura was fried much earlier on. Love the spicy crab roll."}
{"text":"A tiny place that produces excellent sushi, fast and incredibly cheap-geared towards takeout. There's a tiny eating counter inside but you can sit outside or get takeout and walk to the lakefront and have a picnic. Perfect for this summer."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be my favorite four years ago when I first moved into the building. The owners are very nice and friendly. I used to come here every week, but it seems over the years they've lost their quality. It has significantly gone down. The last time I got the brown rice spicy salmon roll I was extremely sick after. Other people in the condo building have also commented on the same and we do not eat there anymore. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This was quick, delicious and friendly service. I tried the Black Dragon with a side of seaweed salad. Only cash and debit accepted here, no credit."}
{"text":"The sushi was good for its price and it was fast and efficient for takeout :) would come again if I'm near the area!"}
{"text":"Black dragon roll is my yardstick for evaluating sushi places, and Kokoro's was amazing. Great price considering the huge portion size. Placed my order at the till and waited only less than 10 minutes for it to be made.   A must-try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"CHEAP AND GOOD. Honestly for rolls and not high quality sashimi, it doesn't get much better than this.  What's the most worth it is the combos they have on the chalkboard or in their menu. The combos comes with 2-4 types of rolls or sushi's for $10-$20.  I got the Roll Combo A, which consisted of spicy salmon, california, and avacado rolls. 18 pieces of good sized sushi for $11. My friend got the kokoro combo 4, which consisted of 10 giant pieces of dynamite sushi (the one with tempura in the middle), and 6 pieces of spicy salmon for $12. It was delicious and really filling. My friend couldnt even finish her combo and i had to help her (cuz i eat a lot). The spicy salmon was a little too salty but filled with really good sauce, the rice on all the rolls were pretty standard. Definitely not skimpy on the filling. My favourite thing about the dynamite roll was that it also contains tempura yam, along with tempura shrimp. Super awesome.   They also have a little dessert/ice cream bin if you wanna buy things like mochi balls...mmm....  The only downside is that there's no room to sit inside. There are three small tables and chairs outside if you wanna eat there and you're lucky there's space. But I'm not sure what you can do in the winter. Just get take-out. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant for a date night. Ambiance and decor is very modern and fits perfectly with the mood . We ordered the eel and sake specialty which was amazing. Portions are perfect and will definitely think of this as my next go to sushi place for a night out with friends. It's a small restaurant so I suggest you reserve ahead of time to avoid waiting for a table :)"}
{"text":"Not sure why people love this place. Decent quick sushi if you need takeout or a quick bite, but nothing I'd go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Ordered combo b (spicy salmon roll and 6 sushi) and a spicy tuna roll. I think this is the first time that I've ever found spicy salmon and spicy tuna to be spicy! The wasabi was fresh and spicy too.  I went around 1pm and it wasn't a long wait. I maybe waited 5 minutes as there were a few before me.   Price was pretty good ($14) but there wasn't much salmon or tuna in the rolls. It was mainly spicy tempura so I was a little disappointed that I wasn't really getting my money's worth.   Their combo choices are pretty good but I didn't see any sushi bento boxes which would have been nice."}
{"text":"It is decent sushi in a pinch and definitely good value, given the amount of food you can get for the price you pay, but really the thing that brings them down to a 3 is that their sushi just isn't all that good. I found the fish pieces to be relatively small and barely even tasted the imitation crab in the Cali rolls Furthermore, their miso soup tasted extremely fishy too me - some people like that, but not my thing. I have been here a few times as I nearby, and each time they consistently meet my expectations (which are not all that high)."}
{"text":"First time coming here! Small place, interior looks clean and friendly service. We ordered the green dragon and black/red dragon. They gave us complementary upgrade to brown rice as they've ran out of white rice - the rice tastes good, less sweet, more healthy!   The rolls were big in size, great portions!  The only disappointment we had was that the slices of salmon and eel were so thin (see pictures).   But overall, we were still content, will likely order something else. 2 rolls came to about $30"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi at a reasonable price. I came here with two co-workers and we ordered the Kokoro 4 for $11.95 which comes with 10 pieces of dynamite roll and 6 pieces of spicy salmon roll and also added an extra roll of some sort - total was around $25 for 3 people, and there was enough food. The dynamite roll is really delicious and also kind of unique as they put sweet potato in it. Filling, but I'm not going to complain because I love that stuff. Everything else was pretty standard, but given the price I'd still say it's a good deal. They have some outdoor seating which is convenient if it's a nice day out, but otherwise you're out of luck and will have to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Highly recommended for take out! Great rolls (maki), good nigiri, good quality fish and other ingredients, and very friendly Korean staff.   This is a gem of a little sushi place and better than nearly all of the others within a couple blocks of the financial district. This is one of the better sushi restaurants downtown, especially when you take into account the affordable price.  When we've gone there, they had high quality salmon and white tuna, great avocado, cucumber, and shrimp. The selection's a bit limited, nearly 1/3 of the rolls are \"dynamite rolls\" -- which are excellent.   There's only a few chairs here facing the window, so take out is expected."}
{"text":"Don't get how this place got so high ratings. That just mean there isn't enough good sushi place in downtown core. The owners aren't that nice. One day, the sashimi was actually cooked because rice wasn't chilled enough!! Another day, they put soy sauce on top of miso soup I ordered so whenever I dunk my sushi into how soy sauce, just ruined the food for me. And one day I got my sashimi and it smelled like a feet. I'm don't with this place."}
{"text":"If youre looking for a good value sushi meal near harbourfront, Kokoro sushi is definitely worth trying.   Being a regular here, I usually get the Kokoro 4 combo which consists of a spicy salmon roll (6 pieces) and a dynamite roll (10 pieces) for the price of 11.95$. I would call 10 minutes ahead of time and it would always be ready to go when I arrive. The sushi rolls are always crisp and fresh. Sometimes I would add on a seaweed salad when I'm in the mood for a feast (Yup. A feast) and while it's not a heaping portion like the combo sets, it is still good seaweed salad.   Like others have mentioned, Kokoro Sushi is more of a take out place but there is a small bar area inside along with some tables outside. Most people usually order takeout so it's a pretty busy place during lunch and dinner time.   The service is always very friendly. I had an instance where I walked in before opening time (apparently I'm completely oblivious to signs on the door) and proceeded to order. Instead of asking me to leave, they kindly told me their opening time and told me they would put in an order for me as soon as they opened so that I could pick it up then.   Just a tip: Kokoro Sushi is closed on Mondays. I always seem to forget and crave sushi on Mondays so I learned that the hard way..  If you're in the area, I highly recommend that you give this place a try!"}
