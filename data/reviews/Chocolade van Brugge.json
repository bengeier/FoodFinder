{"text":"I need to buy some chocolates for my wife for our anniversary and just some random ones from any store would do so I found this store on Yelp. They have a large selection of chocolates and they were all delicious. My wife loves them. We will go back in the future to try them all!"}
{"text":"This place is the best!! the belgian waffles are beyond deelish.. i like nutella on top! I always try a couple different chocolates each visit. The owner is so nice and accomodating. Def worth a visit at least once.. it will be your new fav local spot for sweet treats and a bomb cup of joe!"}
{"text":"The Belgian hot chocolate was amazing.  We stocked up on the Christmas gift boxes and asked about their plans for Valentine's Day, Easter, and AZ summers vs. chocolate.  They have it all figured out.  Can't go wrong with Belgian chocolate.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Place was clean and comfortable with a European vibe.  5 stars.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I was never a fan of chocolate until my first trip to Bruges.  Imagine my surprise - and delight - when I discovered this gem in Scottsdale, Arizona.  The chocolate is imported directly from Belgium and the owner is from Bruges.  The waffles are also incredible - made to order delicious goodness; so good that I prefer mine plain, though they offer a variety of toppings."}
{"text":"My coworker and I love chocolate, so we decided to stop in and browse after lunch.  Everything looked so good!  It was difficult to narrow our choices down to two pieces each.  I tried the lavender infused chocolate and it was heavenly.  It looks like we have a new after-lunch tradition!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Higher quality than melting pot. The chocolate dipping experience was not only tasty but owner discussed the history of chocolate too. Entertaining for sure.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Expensive as shit...but it's pretty damn good! Ill come back when I get a raised at work!"}
{"text":"Tried the food truck . I ordered the cyclist to share with my 2 year old son that has a peanut allergy . I'm not sure of the exact written description, but I know for sure that it didn't include peanuts. The picture showed a waffle,on top of that the melted biscoff cookie butter, topped with sliced banana, and what was obviously cinnamon. Looked absolutely delicious. I recieved a waffle with everything in the description, but cinnamon substituted with peanuts. I should have made them aware of the peanut allergy from the get go, but I assumed the dish was free of peanuts because of the description. I nicely told them that my son had a peanut allergy and they apologized and gladly re-made it without peanuts. The waffle was indeed delicious, BUT my son still ended up with welts at the corner of his mouth which I could only assume was from cross contamination. This review is to warn parents with children with allergies and to make Chocolade Van Brugge aware of the dangers of allergies and how important it is to provide your customers with detailed descriptions of your product or provide a good allergen warning on your menu."}
{"text":"Waffles are small and overpriced. Last time we got waffles from this place we ended up getting a stomach bug. The guy that was running the place was a bit rude and their to go containers didn't fit the waffles. We ended up using two plates together to make a to go container. By the time we got home, which is not far away, the whipped cream was liquid.   I wouldn't recommend this place. Try waffle love or waffle crush if you want a good waffle."}
{"text":"They have excellent chocolate, hot chocolate and waffles! I'm a chocolate lover and everytime go to the store I end up so happy! I love this place!"}
{"text":"The waffle with biscoff spread it probably the best thing I have ever had. The man that helped me was very friendly and service was great."}
{"text":"Although the chocolate is in the pricier side, it is well worth the premium price tag!  When I took a sip of their hot chocolate, I immediately announced how it tasted exactly like melted chocolate.   To my amazement, it WAS melted chocolate.  Unbelievably good stuff and the owner was incredibly nice!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for hot chocolate for dessert.  We had both the milk and dark chocolate and it was great.  The hot chocolate comes with extra chocolate to make it stronger (we didn't need the extras), whipped cream and a biscuit.    We also sampled a few chocolates which were delicious (esp the blueberry one).   All the chocolate is imported from Belgium."}
{"text":"The waffles are sweet and crisp just how they should be.  I had mine with strawberries and chocolate sauce and it was so good.  Chocolate sauce wasn't too sweet and thick and the strawberries were fresh.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I used Chocolade van Brugge for an event I organized in Phoenix and I am sure glad I did. Fred and his team were first rate! From the planning phase right up to the day of the event, Fred was incredibly attentive, accessible and easy to work with. There were a lot of details to the event but none so small that Fred did not have time to discuss. And the food was delicious! The clients really loved the waffle station, as well as the delicious authentic Belgian chocolates. The service throughout was attentive and I could see that they were all on top of it. My client loved it and Fred helped to make the event a great success.  I would certainly use Fred again and highly recommend his company for an event of any size."}
{"text":"OMG - just wow!  If you haven't been here, you're missing out.  I love chocolate, and there's nothing better than good chocolate to me.  Well, walking into Chocolade Van Brugge for the first time was heaven on earth for me.  I read about them in Arizona Foothills magazine and then got on the phone and made a reservation for that Friday.  I spoke with Fred, the owner and he was super nice and helpful.  He happily made a reservation for my husband and I several hours after he normally closes (I didn't notice his hours until after I made the reservation and I felt so bad).  When we arrived, we were warmly greeted, by Fred.  I mentioned that I didn't notice his hours until after we got off the phone, and I felt bad that he stayed open just for us.  He was so kind and said it was his pleasure.  We then enjoyed an epic dipping party, where there's warm vats of white, milk and dark chocolate and a plate of yummy things to dip into it, not to mention the delicious waffle, to die for. After we finished we couldn't help but get a sampling of the stunning (and delicious) candies in the display case.  Everything was to die for.   As we were checking out, Fred told us in a few weeks he'd be offering a Groupon for half the price, he didn't want us to feel we over paid, so he gave us the Groupon price, yeah, he's that nice!  After such a great experience, I jumped on the Groupon and bought it for another visit.  So a few months later we came back, Fred was there again and remembered us and welcomed us back warmly.  He's so nice and down to earth and we so enjoy talking to him when we go in.  He always goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great time, and with his amazing chocolate, how could you not?   We will definitely be back, in fact we couldn't stay away if we tried.    Thanks Fred, we'll see you again soon.   PS - it's BYOB, so take advantage and bring something to compliment the chocolate."}
{"text":"Delicious, un peu cher but it's all imported and delicious. Must try if you are in town. Indulge."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were walking around after my birthday lunch this afternoon and stopped in for a fun treat.  We got two chocolates each and at the counter I filled out the card for their rewards program, including my birthday information.  We left and were walking down the sidewalk when there was a shout behind us--we turned around and lo and behold, there was the owner (I'm assuming) running after us.    \"You forgot to pick out your birthday box,\" he said.  I said no, that I didn't fill out the card to get something for TODAY, but maybe next year.  He insisted however, and we went back to the shop where I picked out two more chocolates (complementary!) and received a very warm \"Happy Birthday.\"  It's little things like that that are so thoughtful, and I'd like to thank Chocolade van Brugge for helping to make my birthday even more special than out already was.  Oh, and the chocolates are WONDERFUL."}
{"text":"Lets just say the authentic Liege waffle is best since Belguim  with real pearl sugar. And their chocolate is imported from Belgium which is incredible. Stop reading and go there now!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent chocolates!  Cute location on Marshall Way.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  THis place is pricey though!  I got a cup of coffee and a three small pieces of chocolate my bill was just over $10.  Good for an occasion but not something I plan on treating myself to on a daily occasion!"}
{"text":"We had the caramel butter which is shaped like a gold bar, the praline with hazelnuts, the pistachio creme, and the white truffle. Other than the white truffle, nothing else seemed to be worth $2.50 a pop. We bought the sample box which was a better deal, 4 pieces for $9, even then, it was still overpriced. I regret not having the hot chocolate and waffles, it seems that was the better deal."}
{"text":"This was an awful experience.  My daughter and I decided to try the waffle with chocolate.  Yuck!  The waffle was thin- and had a sticky-gooey consistency like the batter was over beaten, too much sugar and the iron was too hot.  We expected the chocolate sauce to be a divine chocolate experience.  It was so thick and sweet- honestly it tasted like they used Smucker's Hot Fudge sauce straight out of the jar. Yuck!  And their so called fresh whip cream- I saw it- it comes straight out of a can!  They use the ready made whip cream from Smart n- Final!!  The portions were so tiny- for $7 we got 1/4 of a thin waffle and about 1/8 cup of chocolate colored goo.  Higher prices don't make things taste any better.  If I could- I would give them a negative star rating."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars, I would! First, let me start out by saying that the owner - Fred - is wonderful. He takes such good care of his regular as well as new customers. The place itself is clean, cute and cozy. Now, let's get to the chocolate and waffles...  I started coming here when it first opened and was amazed by the vast variety of exquisite chocolate flavors, with new ones always being added - all imported directly from Belgium. Then, last month I got to visit the lovely city of Brugge itself. I can say first hand that Fred's chocolates AND waffles are the absolute real deal - even better than some of the places we tried out there! Chocolade van Brugge is now an absolute must every time I visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here, while visiting from Austin, TX. If we could've tried one of everything we would have. I highly recommend taking the owner's suggestions when picking out chocolates to try. Also, try the coffee. They serve a Dutch brand called Douwe Egberts and I LOVE it!"}
{"text":"So far the best waffles We have ever had. We had it topped with vanilla ice cream and with the caramelizes exterior,  it was the perfect combination."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to have our company party here this year and it was amazing.  First off I will admit that I love chocolate.  But CVB takes chocolate to the next level.  For our dipping party were were presented with both milk and dark chocolate. We then had the opportunity to dip or cover various items in this delicious chocolate.  The chocolate is so good, that even pepperoni dipped in chocolate was excellent.  Now if you are not there for dipping, their display cases are filled with so many delicious items you will just have to get a few to take with you.  Additionally you can get a fresh Belgium waffle cover in chocolate too!  This place is definitely a treat, so be sure to visit it when in the area."}
{"text":"Nice place with good chocolate but I've been to belgium and eaten chocolate there and in my opinion it is slightly better. That being said this place is worth a visit anyway as belgium is pretty far away and this is still really good"}
{"text":"I try to have will power and 90% of the time I do pretty good...at least when it comes to savory foods. However when I'm faced with a delicious sweet treat, it's like Pandora's box had been opened and I'm done for. Now I have never been lucky enough to travel to Belgium but after tasting authentic chocolate from there, I am putting a visit at the top of my list. I am so excited to get the first to review for this business and hope I am far from the last. This new Belgium chocolate shop just opened up a couple weeks ago and today I paid them a visit and got to calm my sweet tooth cravings. The Belgium owner was incredibly knowledgable and said they import their chocolate directly from a Belgium man he's known  forever. He then asked me about my taste bud preferences. While I like all chocolate, I'm typically more drawn to milk chocolate and if you add anything caramel, marshmallow or peanut butter then I'm really sold. He directed me to the milk chocolate with caramel inside. One bite and I was in chocolate heaven. The caramel was sweetly delicious and I knew I must have more. I ended up buying two more of the chocolate caramel and two chocolate cream which I was told is like a combination of whip cream and brandy. I'm sold. I will be visiting often and can't wait to try their hot chocolate and coffee. They also had some amazing looking croissants and adorable chocolate gnomes, pumpkins for Thanksgiving and will be getting Yule logs soon. I immediately envisioned serving ice cream sundaes inside the hollow chocolate fixtures.   My advice to you is to pay this new chocolatier a visit and nip your chocolate cravings. If you're wondering where they are located, I will tell you! They are right along the ArtWall, across the street from Tea Time."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing selection of Belgian chocolates.  I had one of the pear flavored delicacies and one of the praline.  Both were very good but the pear was very unique and definitely my favorite."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place and it was the best waffle any of us in our group had ever had. The plain was perfect and filling! We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I was hoping this chocolate would be something special, but it really wasn't.  Two pieces were $5 and we took it home with us to Tennessee to savor after a dinner.  My boyfriend got a dark chocolate and I got a milk chocolate.  It just wasn't really anything to write home about and it was quite expensive.  The customer service there was very nice and was knowledgeable about the origins of the chocolate."}
{"text":"Please update your hours with Yelp. Drove all the way here on a Monday from far north Scottsdale only to find it closed.  According to Yelp, you are open. FAIL."}
{"text":"This chocolate shop is quite simply the best, and a must visit not only for yourself (yes they give free samples), but also any special person in your life that you can't figure out what to get, but your present needs to say that they are simply worth and deserving of the best!  For those not in the know, Belgium chocolate is the best bar none. Yes, that right better that Swiss, German and even my favorite English, but that's only because I'm British and grew up on the stuff. That said, any serious European will tell you that Belgium chocolate is the best and what you buy for that special person in your life whether it's your spouse, mother, grandmother and/or any man or woman that you need to impress.  Heads up, they currently offer a 5 percent discount off your next purchase with your receipt. Also you can have dinner at 5th and Wine around the corner as their chocolate is on the dessert menu. I recommend eating fast, because you are going to want to get more chocolate before you head home."}
{"text":"Hot chocolate was on point.  The waffle with dark chocolate, caramel and sea salt was as good as it sounds.  Great flavors blended together.  Clean and friendly atmosphere perfect for meeting your significant other or just go hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Growing up in Germany eating swiss and belgian chocolate, having traveled to bruges and spending an entire day gouging on chocolate and washing it down with a good trippel, I feel I have a good basis of comparison.  Imagine my excitement when I heard about this chocolate transplant, directly from the source.  I personally feel that the highlight of your visit here is going to be the chocolate dipping experience. I think it equals if not surpasses anything that the melting pot has to offer. White, chocolate, and dark chocolate terrines wait expectantly for you to dip a variety of interesting morsels into them. Not just your plebeian strawberry and bananas, but a smorgasboard of salami, salty potato chips, cheetos, cheese curds, mangos, and more. Enjoy this with a traditional summer drink, affogato, which is espresso poured over gelato.  As for the chocolate offerings themselves...after taking home a box of four ranging from marzipan to amaretto - I was grievously disappointed at the taste and texture of the chocolate. In fact it was so lackluster and did nothing to awaken in me any sense of nostalgia, that I did not even finish them. For a chocolate lover, this was a surpising moment.  A sad day indeed."}
{"text":"Awesome chocolate!  A little expensive, but worth it for quality chocolate.  It was hard to pick something because it all looked so good.  If you love fine quality chocolate, it is worth stopping here."}
{"text":"Liege waffles with bischoff sauce, mmmmmm You know those airline cookies you get? The Bischoff? They turned it into a sauce!  Its the exact same flavor!  THe waffles are not your normal waffles, they are more a dough than a batter, so they have a lot more substance to them than waffles we typically get. And everything comes direct from Belgium.  The service was also excellent!  Prompt and extremely nice.  If you get there and there's a line, be ready to wait a bit to get your food since there is only one person but it is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I am surprised that I just found out about this place. I just typed \"chocolate\" in my yelp search and then this place popped up. This small shop was spotless,  but the beautifully and perfectly arranged chocolates immediately captured my attention. Our chocolate concierge was very informative and patient. She answered all our questions and explained how each was handmade in Belgium. They are a little on the pricy side and at first we were going to get 2 each. However,  they are so beautiful we had to each get 4.  The box of 8 chocolates was $28. It was worth it! I was not disappointed by any of my choices. I hope (hint,hint) that I'll get some Valentines yummies here instead of that other place with the \"S\" in its name."}
{"text":"Try a waffle, they are authentic Belgian style with imported ingredients. Great place to have a snack and drink some coffee or chocolate"}
{"text":"I've had a craving for a Liege http://forvo.com/word/liège/#fr waffle smothered in dark chocolate ganache since summer, when I visited last and found the shop closing early due to high heat = slow business.  Chocolade van Brugge is back to its normal closing time of 6 pm, so I was able to swing by after my afternoon massage at SWIHA.  So happy I stopped by, because the new fall/autumn shipment from Belgium just arrived the day before!  I was able to sample the Sea Salt in dark chocolate, and it was satisfyingly delicious with a caramel crunch top layer.  (Dark chocolate is my favorite of the two choices, and no, white chocolate doesn't contain chocolate at all; It consists of sugar, cocoa butter, and milk solids.)  After eating an entire Liege waffle and its glorious dark chocolate goodness, with a delightful cup of Douwe Egberts coffee, https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chocolade-van-brugge-scottsdale?select=lXUAfgYmNhsn5COINzhz0w I decided to look more deeply into the new autumn selections.  There were so many to choose from that it took me a LONG time to settle on just 12.  Btw, CvB now has new gift boxes, which showcase these lovely creations! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chocolade-van-brugge-scottsdale?select=nXwiawt4du6gWVLBAtRQEw  Don't know just how biodegradeable/green the packaging is, but the chocolates present well in them.  One caveat to the new design is that you ONLY get 12 truffles for $25, whereas in the past, you could get an extra truffle, if the rep or owner was feeling generous.  ;)  However, if you ask nicely, you may sample a new (to you) selection, as well as get extra ganache on what's left of your waffle so that you may save face by NOT having to lick the plate clean!  Thank you Kind Chocolate Goddess for saving me from potential embarrassment!  (Though, sadly, I was the only one there from 5:15 pm until she closed shop at 5:55 pm.)  But I digress... my 12 selections were, clockwise from top left: https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chocolade-van-brugge-scottsdale?select=GLzaqqC3vv52VkV0kCcT8w  Mokka, Meringue, Chili, Coconut, Almond liqueur, Tiramisu, Pumpkin, (Milk Gianduja), Koffee, Hazelnut creme, and (Milk Sea Salt).    I ordered all but two in dark chocolate.  For Mom, a milk chocolate lover, I only ordered two, because she normally shuns away from expensive chocolates in principle- her way of boycotting my senseless way of wasting money on higher-end organic/non-GMO products, whether they are chocolates, produce, or clothing**- but she practically inhaled these two!  Will have to dedicate a higher percentage for Mommy Dearest with my next purchase.  Have I mentioned that you may take frozen and vacuum-packed Liege waffles home for $3.50 each?  These were already available over the summer, and I remember, because I took one to enjoy at home, since the waffle burners at the shop were already turned off for the day when I had last visited.  It crisped up well in the toaster oven; I wouldn't try warming it in the microwave, as it may well end up a soggy mess, and that would be a very sad waste of a Liege waffle.  Note: These delights can easily cost you a pretty penny, so be sure to check-in on Yelp to take advantage of that 20% off your entire purchase!  You're welcome.  **I've won her over with organic fruits and facial beauty items, though-- SUCCESS!"}
{"text":"A few years ago, we traveled to Belgium to visit our neighbors.  There was the most awesome chocolate shop nearby by a man named Marcolini.  Turns out that Chocolade van Brugge fulfill the expectation of true Belgian chocolate the chocolatier studies under Marcolini. My first trip was to buy a birthday gift and a box to share with my girlfriends.  All raved about the taste and I particularly like the way the various flavors come through each bite. I'm so happy to have this store in our city and will be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Best waffles ever eaten! We were in an art gallery and overheard two young college students from Tempe talking about the restaurant. Talk about passion for food!  According to the owner they come in once a week or so for a waffle fix.  I understand why.  The owner is personable and the location is small and modern"}
{"text":"Totally in love with this place!!   Even though people say it's expensive it's worth the price."}
{"text":"LOVED it!  We went for the chocolate dipping tasting.  You have to set up an appointment for it and it was soooo gooood!   There are three melted chocolates... dark, milk and white.  We had a rectangular platter each, of a bunch of different things to dip into the chocolate of our choice.  Apple slices, banana, pretzels... I can't remember all of the items but we sure had a great time and loved every bit of it.  Honestly, we thoroughly enjoyed the conversation with the gentleman behind the counter.  Afterwards, we decided to get some special chocolates for friends for their wedding gift.  Guess what?  YEAH!  THEY LOVED IT!   We are going back and even though it's been over a month, we are still singing their praises!"}
{"text":"Nice little chocolate, waffle and ice cream shop in old town Scottsdale.  Prices are high, as you would expect for the location and for the fact that they import the waffles and chocolates from Belgium.  You can save money if you buy the chocolates by the box and not individually, example each chocolate is $2.50 a piece, but it is $25 for a 12 chocolate box.  The waffles are good, like the chocolates they are pricey also at $3.50 each just for plain, double that when you add the toppings however the salted caramel topping is to die for. Lots of variety on the chocolates and the waffle toppings.  Haven't tried the ice cream yet but we'll be back for sure to check it out after we get our next bonus checks."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place and have been back 3 times.  Very friendly service.  Great chocolates.  It's a needed place of business in downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My first experience here was not the best due to a mistake that made my three pieces of chocolate cost $28. Although my first impression wasn't the best, the owner was quick to resolve the situation and was professional and polite. They have some of the best chocolate but they can run out of the great pieces leaving good chocolate. But if you wait for the owner to return from Europe where the chocolate is hand made you are in for a delicious time. The chocolate is priced well at only $2.50 each. If you are ever in old town Scottaslade and want something sweet and delicious this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I've been to several cities in Belgium before and have sampled a lot of their chocolate, and this chocolate shop really falls short in quality. It also seems like they add so much sugar to their chocolates that you really can't taste the chocolates anymore. Their chocolate is decent but definitely not worth the amount of money they're charging for it (about $25 for 12 pieces). If you really want to go there, I recommend buying one or two small pieces to try first before purchasing a large quantity of anything. That way you'll be able to tell whether or not it will be worth it."}
{"text":"This review is based on the chocolates alone.  The customer service was excellent, and we did not try the waffles or any drinks.  I must have cheap taste in chocolates because I really did not see what all the fuss is about with these.  I tried a dark chocolate with strawberry cream filled, and it hardly tasted like strawberry.  I also tried the raspberry and it was not that impressive.  I must be missing something.  My mom tried a few others and we both agreed that $18 for 8 chocolates it was not worth it.  I did use my Yelp check in and received 20% off, but still....that is pretty steep for chocolates.  Especially ones that I really was not that wowed by."}
{"text":"I don't need to bore you with my travel history.   I had a waffle from the food truck and it was probably the best waffle I've had. It was almost like it was made from mini donut batter and the outside was a little bit crispy as if it had been fried like a pastry. With fresh strawberries and hot fudge topping it was excellent. 2 of my friends had one as well and loved them as well."}
{"text":"Just a very lovely place nestled in the little shops and galleries along Marshall way. We loved the chocolates that reminded us of all our European vacations. It's a great place to finish out a night of fine dining in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Hot chocolate sets the bar for all others, a cup of that and a waffle will leave you smiling and on a sugar high.  A must try and try again! Great place!"}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best chocolate available hands down!  You need to remember something about me- I am an avid foodie and I tend to set the record straight when it comes to chocolates.  If you value rich, natural flavors with authentic history then you will appreciate this place.  Ask to do a dipping party, get a box of 8 to go, or better yet, get a waffle with speculoose.  You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"I seriously cannot add anything more than what has already been said. Divine chocolate, gracious owner, and the cocoa is out of this world. Don't miss this place if you're wandering in old town Scottsdale!"}
