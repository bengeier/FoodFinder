{"text":"These guys are the best. Fresh ingredients and everything is made from scratch. The house salad with house dressing is staple at our house."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets. If you have not been here you need to put it on your list of places to eat.  The specialty pizzas are outstanding.  Yes, the cost is more than average pizza, but you get what you pay for.  You will not be disappointed.  We had the zeus pizza and it was delicious.  The pizza crust was nice and crispy and had loads of toppings.  You can also buy the pizza by the slice to try a couple different kinds.  Don't pass on the steak and yellow pepper rolls either they are great for eating in or take out.  To finish off a great dinner the deserts are in a category of their own,  excellent."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in a long time. Decor is fantastic         All food made fresh with great products. You get what you pay for. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"We tried aiello's for the first time. I noticed when we walked in around 5:30 there was a long line for take out. That was a good sign. We found a table. Ordered our food. I ordered lasagna my husband ordered the LaCorleone. His sandwich was very good, I tasted it, he liked it. I was alittle disappointed with the lasagna since it looked like it was thrown in a take out container and reheated. It tasted good but didn't look like lasagna I ever had. Gee I wish I had gotten pizza. Salad is huge and pretty good. Desserts were not that great. They claim they are fresh made. My tiramisu was soggy and tasteless. Apparently they are made ahead and stored in serving containers ,put in cooler. All and all I would go again but definitely just for pizza. I'd like to mention too the review I read nicknamed  the owner as\"Pizza Nazi\" I couldn't agree more. I won't go into detail only to mention he ought to smile once in a while and be gracious."}
{"text":"Over priced and not that good. Very thin pizza. Would not go back again. Menios is way better and is twice the size and is the same price."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a couple of days ago, what a little gem! Very nice inside, great decor, the employees are very friendly and greeted us when we walked in. We sat at the bar and watched them make the pizzas.  Its self serve, you just place your order at the counter and grab your drinks etc and your set. I had the gyro salad and I can honestly say it was one of the best I ever had... It was huge, got two meals out of it. My boyfriend had the Italian hoagie and a slice of pizza....he is STILL talking about it and telling people about it.  We personally thought the prices were very fair! Keep up the great work gentleman you have a gold mine here! We will be back often. If you haven't been there yet make sure you stop in!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza around hands down.  While not cheap the quality and freshness are worth it. Try the Siciliano for a great thick crust that's not greasy. This is the place to go when you are craving pizza!"}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing!!! And the salads are too!! All of the ingredients are fresh & top of the line Italian specialty store taste. Did I mention the peanut butter cheesecake- best I've had! We loved it and will surely be back!"}
{"text":"The first Aiello's pizza was had tonight by four of us.  The pizza was good.  When you start with quality ingredients, it is hard to have a bad end product.  Location is very clean.  Now for the reasons this is not a five-star review.    1) The paper napkins are so small, you cannot place a napkin on your lap.  This is a problem for 2 reasons: a.  Etiquette and manners and b. Unless you orchestrate a jigsaw puzzle of napkins four deep on your lap without them falling on the floor, messy pizza and/or sauce lands on your clothes.  Napkins are so thin, you can see through them and they can only be used once.  We had to make multiple trips to the napkin stand which is a pain in the ass because you can only get one napkin out at a time.  Do not wear good clothes to this restaurant.  Bring your own quality paper napkins unless you want to constantly be up and down. 2) This establishment is BYOB.  It is not good to learn this after you arrive for dinner.  Little did I know how I was about to direly miss not having alcohol.  Bring your own booze. 3) If you want or need to drink water with your meal, they give you a very small cup to use at the drink dispenser.  As a result, because you are eating salty pizza and, in my case, because I have braces, you are repeatedly getting up to refill your own water cup because there are no waitresses.  This is difficult to navigate with all the tables filled (small dining room) and disrupts the experience and discussions you are having with your fellow guests.  Bring your own large cup if you want to drink water unless you want to constantly be up and down. 4) There is only one unisex bathroom so, a line formed at the bathroom.  This is disruptive to the experience.  I planned on getting some paper towels from the bathroom to use as napkins but CURSES, FOILED AGAIN!!!!  There are none.  Just a forced air hand dryer.  You cannot bring your own bathroom. 5) There are no metal utensils in this restaurant.  The traditional pizza crust is VERY tough/hard to cut or bite into.  It is very dark on the bottom with about 25% charred black.  Because I have braces, I had to try to cut the pizza with a plastic knife and fork.    I could not do it quickly.  I got up, again, to ask for a metal knife and they had none.  Plastic fork #1 broke and a tine disappeared, I feared that I accidentally ate it (this could potentially kill someone).  Another trip away from my table to get a fork.  My sister's broke 3 tines off her plastic fork at the same time and she was not eating the hard crusted pizza, she was eating the red top pizza.  My plastic fork #2 also broke.  My plastic fork #3 imploded into three separate shards (handle broke in 3 pieces) when I tried to cut through the crust.  At this point, my frustration had reached its breaking point.  I ultimately found my missing broken off tine in the used napkin graveyard so I can sleep tonight knowing it will not be lodged in the side of my intestines.  I have concern about food that is cut up for children in this restaurant.  If the adults do not notice their fork tines have broken off in the food, the child may accidentally swallow the sharp tines.  Bring your own metal utensils unless you want to constantly be up and down getting replacement plastic utensils.   6) I spent so much time getting up and down, waiting in line for the bathroom, and trying to cut through my meal that I had to abort the errand running I had planned because the meal time took 30 minutes longer than it should have.  I walked out of there feeling like I had been punked.  I will not eat in this restaurant again unless I have the time to pack what I need in advance.  If I ever eat Aiello's again, it is going to have to be a takeout order.  While they may have reasons/rationalizations for what we went through (none of which I care to hear), there are no excuses that can explain any of this."}
{"text":"Went there last night for a birthday dinner celebration.  Everything was amazing!  While we have tried their pizzas, it was the first time I had a dinner entree.  Wow!  The portions are extremely generous- could have fed three with my veal dinner- they provide lots of garlic bread, salads were delicious.  And since we brought our own wine, the bill was very reasonable!  I highly recommend this place- Pete puts his heart into his food and it shows.  My only suggestion is to get rid of the plastic utensils but overall, great night."}
{"text":"Pricey for a place with no waiters and plastic utensils but the food was excellent. My wife and I had pasta dishes that were huge and very tasty. My daughter had a buffalo salad that she said was very good too. It also was huge. The grandkids had pizza which they said was very good. We had lots of take home leftovers."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food and a great atmosphere!  I can honestly say that I am addicted to several of their menu items!  My kids ask to go to Aiello's on a weekly basis. The Eggplant Parmesan sandwich is the best I have ever had.  No matter what you order, you can tell right away that these owners don't take any shortcuts.  Everything from the lobster bisque soup to the pepperoni rolls is delicious!  If you haven't tried this place, you are missing out!!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Aiello's and I wish I had tried it sooner! My friend and I ordered the The Opus X pizza which has poached pears on it, but they were unable to make it because they were out of poached pears. No problem, the extensive pizza menu made it easy to choose another. I did take off one star because they were unable to make it.   We chose the Montana - garlic ranch sauce, chicken, pancetta, kettle cooked potato chips (yes, chips!) and several cheeses. It was delicious! The crust is perfect, the flavors were great. We also shared a piece of devil's food cheesecake which was extremely chocolatey and delicious. I look forward to trying many of the other pizzas, or, ALL of them.   They only take cash, which is somewhat inconvenient if you don't know that ahead of time, but they do have an atm available inside the facility. It is nice and clean and well maintained and there is outdoor seating as well.  Keep in mind the pizza is a bit pricey but they are using fresh and higher quality (and cost) ingredients.  One 8 cut Montana and one slice of the cheesecake and our bill was $33. To me, worth it!"}
{"text":"This is my first time eating Aiello's pizza and I am so fat and happy!! The Sicilian pizza tasted like childhood and the guys that work here are super friendly and hilarious. If you haven't tried this place, it's totally worth every bite!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pizza. I am not from the area and was not sure what to expect. I was not disappointed at all. I even had to go back to try another pizza just to make sure they deserved this 5 star review. This place is great and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and experience. It is obvious that not only are all the ingredients fresh but also very high quality. It can be difficult to find both of those in restaurants these days. It's also obvious that the owner is very passionate about his business. Beyond the food being wonderful, it is also a very clean and comfortable environment. This is NOT just a pizza joint! It is a very high quality restaurant but with a casual approach. Comparing it to a chain pizza company is a disservice. There's nothing wrong with enjoying a pizza from one of the \"big\" chains but the food at Aiello's is special. Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I got a pizza to go today. I ordered one of their artisanal pizzas the sopressata. The pizza was beyond good. It was as the yelper above said 5*. I've eaten the Squirrel Hill location 100's of times and it is spot on here. The inside of the place is amazingly decorated. Very very nice atmosphere. They do sell slices like in PGH. The reason I didn't give a 5 star has nothing to do with the food but what I noticed inside. First off it's expensive. I always thought a Vinnie Pie was expensive, this place thinks they are a fine dining pizza shop. If you get a xl plain its almost $20. The other reason only 4 star, I noticed on their soda dispenser they charge for tap water, they say its purified but I don't care. Who charges for tap water? This also goes to my above EXPENSIVE. Last thing I agree with the other reviewer if you spend all this money to make the place this nice why not have servers? Your not dealing with Murry Ave. where people just walk in off the street.Last thing who only accepts cash at their prices?  Over all I would go back and get another pie."}
{"text":"Nice, tucked in find in Penn Trafford!  Great pizza, sweet sauce, and gluten free option available! The owner is knowledgable on gluten free and cross contamination.  Atmosphere is cozy, rustic Italian. I adore this place! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because they are a CASH ONLY restaurant.   Recommendation: gluten free Margarita pizza (Delish!!!!)"}
{"text":"Went here a while ago, so there may have been some changes since. The first issue is that the food is expensive, and although there is a lot of food presented the quality wasn't decent. Also, they are a cash only bsuiness, but they have an ATM. The food was good and the staff was friendly, but too procey."}
{"text":"The food was very very good but a whee bit more than what I'm used to paying but the food came out pretty quick and as everyone else said the place is spotless. I've seen dirtier hospitals"}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST pizza around.  The sandwiches are great too.  Yes a little pricey but you get what you pay for and here you get good quality ingredients and homemade food not frozen processed."}
{"text":"I just got food from here for the first time.  I agree with a couple of the reviews, the owner was not very cordial.....a little on the Napoleon side maybe?   I ordered half an Italian hoagie (minus onions and tomatoes) but added banana peppers.  Menu says $5.25.  I also ordered a pepperoni roll (was pretty burnt to my liking). He said they were $3.85.(menu says $3.00). According to my math $5.25+$3.85= $9.10.   Add 6% sales tax= $9.65.   He said the total was $11.70.  I went back in and asked him and he said that they raised their prices and banana peppers were extra (nowhere does it say that on their menu).  $6.25 for half a hoagie....REALLY?  I admit and will be honest, the hoagie was very good but $6.25 is highway robbery.  I will not be going back here."}
{"text":"All I can say is I was pleasantly suprised with the atmosphere and the food here! Very clean and the décor is spot on. We ordered the Insalata Caprese Di Parma with homemade fresh mozzarella and a Large extra cheese & tomato pizza. AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!! I'm longing for another pizza as I write this review!  I take all negative reviews with a grain of salt... I was greeted immediately when I walked in and was asked if it was our first time, in which is was our first time. They explained to take a look at the menu then place the order at the register when ready. Not a big deal at all! So what they accept CASH ONLY...there is an ATM inside! I am looking forward to our next visit to the pizzeria which will be very soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Owner makes everything from scratch. Never had a bad thing. We tried every place in Penn Township when we moved here last year and nothing was good. People may say their prices are high but it's truly quality food and you get large portions. And the amount of toppings on the specialty pizzas can fill you up in one slice! So you definitely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place hands down. All there products are fresh and the dough is made in house. This day I had there gluten free pizza. The dough was surprisingly good. I don't need to eat gluten free and would order this pizza again."}
{"text":"The best pizza ever. I've tried the Giuseppe Margarita, Archangel Michael and the regular pie. All are outstanding."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about Aiello's on Murray Ave. it has apparently been a favorite of many for years. One opened in Penn Twp a year or so ago and we thought we would try it. Unfortunately, due to their terrible customer service we won't know how the food tastes. I called to order two large Pizza's and a Hoagie on their menus called Foccacina. The order was going to be almost $70 for those three items.  The lady that answered the phone seemed very nice however when I ordered the hoagie she asked me to wait one second. The than asked someone if he will makes the foccacina. In a very irritated, rude voice a yelled as clear as day \"No, I'm not doing that tonight\". The lady then got back on the phone assuming I did not hear him and trying to politely translate his rude message told me they were out of that sandwich. I will pay just about any price for quality food but that could be the best pizza on earth and they won't be getting a dime from me."}
{"text":"Love this place, I saw some complaints about no table service... Get over it, this is the way it is, many pizza places are like this. I like the owners, there very nice to us since we been going there. They do get busy so they can not devote there attention to you...  The food is delicious and it is all made when ordered so you may have to wait, but it's worth it! It is our favorite Pizza by far!  Thanks to my buddy Italian Tony for recommending it!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza, amazing Italian dinners, awesome subs, and now I can confirm the wings are terrific.  This is our favorite pizza place, and you will not find a cleaner kitchen anywhere.  This place is excellent with everything they do. I also used them to cater a work function, and everything was superb.  Keep up the great work. If you are looking for authentic food made with high quality ingredients, this is the place."}
{"text":"We drove from Monroeville PA to enjoy there extended menu of items.  We walked in to a very pleasant atmosphere, beautiful decor, great aroma.  We sat down at a table for four and someone screamed over \"when ever your ready come on up and place your order\". Hmmm, not going well so far.  Went to the counter to order, one pizza for my wife, baked ziti for me and I asked if they could do plain pasta with butter in lieu of sauce....only fettucini noodles, everything else has sauce on it.  Hmmmm still not going well.  The owner came over to put the order in the computer and had a little hissy fit because the computer wouldn't respond has be pounded the screen.  We told the order taker that our order was for dine in, we then helped ourselves to some soda in \"to go\" cups, got my wife some water in a plastic bottle and then sat and waited.  You will wait a while because the pizza is made to order, the only thing I am guessing that's made to order.  Six people behind the counter and one person doing everything, cooking, calling out peoples names for the orders etc.  After about 20 minutes or name was called, went to the counter to pick up our to eat in order, to see my baked ziti in a tin foil to go container with out the lid, that must be the eat in part, same for my son's pasta with butter and they were kind enough to bring over our pizza.  The ziti was dry dry dry, and the pasta with butter sauce was hard like the noodles had not been cooked enough, I was afraid to say anything to the \"Pizza Natzi\".  The Pizza was outstanding and I would give the pizza a 5 star!  I just don't know why they would spend the money on the decor to make people feel like they shouldn't eat there.  Even our dinner salad was placed in a to go container, and given to us after we told them that we never received our salad.  We happen to over hear the wife, or the waitress taking with another table about being a third generation mozzarella maker and having fresh basil in the back yard, all true, but you need a new generation on customer service.  This area is pretty wealthy and I have a feeling they won't like the lack of customer service they don't deliver.  Paper plates, plastic forks, knives and plastic cups is not the way to serve dine in customers that pay a premium for there meal.  I will be back for the pizza, but it will be \"TO GO\", I wouldn't order anything else, I think they make everything in advance and reheat the food.  To bad."}
{"text":"As promised, I have given Aiello's another try. I have ordered from here twice since my last review. I got a grilled chicken salad once and a pepperoni roll the second time. Both were delicious! I am happy to have a nice pizza joint in the area, although it is still not my go-to place. Cons: cash only and service could still use some tweaking."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Our first visit today, but won't be our last.  We thoroughly enjoyed the Detroit Red Top we ordered.  It was amazing.  I don't even have the best words to describe, like no other pizza I have ever tried. Thick, delightful, buttery crust, cheesy and topped with a sweet tasty sauce. Excellent service, and incredible food made with obviously the highest quality ingredients served in a spotless restaurant."}
{"text":"We've eaten from them at least a dozen times never a disappointment! Food is always excellent and the staff is always friendly. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Aiello's on a Saturday night: Friends:  Zucchini Strips and Detroit Red Top Deep Dish Pizza - both were glorious Us:  Garlic Knots to start, Hubs had a half of a hot sausage (which was still huge) and I had the \"Ciabatta Sandwich\" - perfect size and combination of crusty exterior, banana pepper rings, sauce, hot ham and cheese.  Everything was extremely fresh and extremely tasty.  We cannot wait until visit #2!  Here's what we learned:  Cash only, counter order, table delivery.  Except that your appetizer and your Friends' app may not even be close in delivery.  Everyone will be eating whenever it gets ready, so there is really no flow to the actual meal.  Flavor makes up for this... mostly.  The place is crazy clean with some outdoor seating.  Staff is very nice.  So get casual and get some fabulous food - btw: takeout business is extreme because the locals know where to find some great food!"}
{"text":"Traveling thru the area and stopped into this restaurant. It was a great place. Very clean and great folks taking care of us. We will be back again when we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pie, just like the Squirrel Hill Aiello's but with an upscale-ish kind of feel inside.  The notable difference on the pizza was finishing with what looked to be some basil & parmesan cheeze.  We got a plain collossal for the family and ate the whole thing!  These guys do pizza right.  The sauce is far & above anything else out there, and the crust is thin and crispy yet still manages to be a bit doughy.  It's perfect.  We enjoyed some Turner's Iced Tea & one of the new every-drink-ever pop machines.  I noticed a Fox's & a Pizza Hut nearby. Anyone who goes to those places when Aiello's is right there needs slapped.  Hard."}
