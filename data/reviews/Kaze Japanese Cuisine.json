{"text":"My absolute favourite AYCE sushi restaurant.
Great service. Fantastic food. Always fresh.
They do add a 15% automatic tip but I always leave an extra 5%. They deserve it!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you, the wait is worth the wait! We went for dinner on a saturday night and the place was full house. We probably had to wait 15 minutes or so. The environment was very clean which is a bonus. We decided not to have AYCE, my girlfriend and I had ordered two bento boxes. The portions were quite large that we couldn't even finish half of it and the presentation was good as well. 

Overall, the food quality is great, the staff are nice. We'll be coming back next time. Be sure to make reservations to minimize the wait time especially on weekends! 

Cheers to happy eating :)"}
{"text":"All you can eat? More like, \"how long can you starve\". With a group of around 25, I'm sure they made a decent profit. Especially since after 40 min of waiting we got our first round of sushi. The longer they make you wait, the quicker you will feel full.  It's places like these that taint the concept of \"all you eat\" style restaurants. Sorry Kaze, never again."}
{"text":"Tried twice weekdays night, sashimi & sushi were not as fresh as weekend!"}
{"text":"Went for afternoon AYCE lunch.  

Nice ambience, huge booths!  It seems like a family business?   The sushi was good, with the best selection I've seen for an AYCE.
Pop comes in cans which is great."}
{"text":"worst customer service i have ever seen at a restaurant.  me and my sister want for lunch once to try it out. people that were seated after us and ordered after us got there food way before we did. and just to do a second order i had to walk up to the front because the lady didn't come to our table for over 20min.    The worst part about it is she had the nerve to ask for a tip!!!!    i have never had a waitress or waiter ask for a tip in my life. The funny thing is it was the worst restaurant i have ever been in and told her honestly you aren't even getting a penny.      I will NEVER go back there and i hope you save yourself the headache and don't go either."}
{"text":"2 stars

I will do this in the style of the Good, Bad, and the Ugly
Straight to the point. 

We chose the AYCE route.

Good:
Salmon Sashimi 
Garlic Beef
Friendly server
Popcorn chicken wasn't too salty 

Bad:
Sloppy Preparation and Presentation
Coconut Shrimp was torpedo like resembling a jagged shard of glass
Maki Rolls fall apart, need to be packed cut and cut with a sharper knife
Chicken Teriyaki needs to be crisper on top; it's not just about the t. sauce 
Red Tuna sushi wrong color not fresh
Server didn't know the contents of the rolls - the main menu didn't have it either
No photos of the items
Rice Paper rolls not available

Ugly: 
Scallop Freshness - poison even when fried
Mussels Garlic butter - rubber ducky you're the one; this is a Sesame Street reference btw.
Sesame Ball dessert - Frozen and deep fried, should have been defrosted first
High Cost - for the remote location they are in, it's too much
Mandatory 15% gratuity charge - first I've ever seen
Prices stated are for Cash deal - in this day and age, they should absorb it, price of doing business in the electronic age
Green Tea ice cream was freezer burnt 


Summary: There are better value AYCE choices out there. The cost cutting is apparent with sloppy preparation and use of many frozen items; price gouging practices (cash and mandatory 15%). Perhaps there's better value in their meal options but not going the AYCE route.

Read the fine print.
Mandatory 15% gratuity charge
Prices are in Cash"}
{"text":"I've been there 3 times now. 

Quick to get a table on a Friday night. Lots of room in the booths. Fairly wide selection from the AYCE menu. Food was decent. 

However, the service was less than stellar. They kept forgetting our requests/orders and we had to remind them several times."}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation from another Yelper.
The Sushi was fantastic. The Sashimi pieces were enormous yet not cut all the way through, and the rest of the food was done really well. 
I found that the quality of food here was excellent and the service was exceptional. Our waitress was incredibly attentive and accommodating to all of our requests and orders, and they didn't miss a dish, unlike so many other AYCE Sushi places.
The only thing holding back the 5th star is the price. $22.99 for a weekend dinner menu is on the pricier side, but it was all the additional \"fees\" that did it. 
There was an automatic 15% added to our bill for gratuity, and if you don't have cash with you, add another 5%! Dinner for four was $120 with all the fees minus the 5%. So if we didn't have cash, it would have cost an additional $6; pretty skimpy if you ask me.
Slightly out of the way from my normally trodden trail, it was worth the experience. If I'm in the neighborhood again and hankering for some Sushi, I'd go back."}
{"text":"Kaze is an AYCE sushi restaurant that serves hamachi and red tuna. You don't see this too often, especially hamachi as they're usually pricier than other sashimi. So based on this alone, they deserve a star! 

The sashimi were all very fresh, sliced in generous portions. They do not have Ikura like Sushi Fun, but I can just stuff my face all day with hamachi sushi. nomnomnom.. 

The service is attentive considering this is an AYCE restaurant. You have to order everything with the server - I think it would have been more efficient if we could write down our order. The items on the menu weren't numbered, but were instead grouped in segments. I found this a bit difficult to find what I wanted, and there was no description for their specialty rolls, however, the server was happy to describe what was in the Kaze Roll and Rice Paper Roll.

Kaze also has surprisingly chewy ramen - too bad the soup base was extremely bland. I'm also a fan of their chopped scallop sushi - I rarely see that here in Toronto! 

They don't try and pack their sushi full of rice to stuff up their customers, but they do offer pop as part of the AYCE deal. So be mindful not to waste your stomach on carbonated drinks! 

Their coconut ice cream is pretty good, and has actual coconut pieces in it. The green tea ice was a bit freezer burnt.. The price per person is on par with most AYCE places (around $23 per person) however, they do charge automatic gratuity."}
{"text":"My mom wanted AYCE sushi for her birthday lunch.
We wanted to try a place that we haven't been to and ended up at Kaze.

The decor is incredibly basic with fake vines and hanging Ikea flower lights.  The bright lighting made our ghetto-looking laminated menus glisten.  One of our spoons was even a plastic spoon disguised as a metal spoon.  I wonder where they got those...anyways.

It looked like a basic Asian eatery where you'd expect lunch specials for 3.99 with a HK style tea and watered down soup.

As for vibe... it's the vibe of an empty restaurant at noon on a Saturday.
There were more people making sushi than in the restaurant.
So, you'd think that we'd get decent service.
Nope.

The food is actually not that bad.
They do have some interesting special rolls available.
I don't expect a lot in terms of quality, it is an AYCE.

As long as my sushi and sashimi isn't warm (ew) and reasonably fresh, it's AYCE passable.

The menu is large but pretty comparable to other AYCE sushi places.
I prefer other AYCE sushi places.

I'm pretty sure I won't be coming back to Kaze anytime soon."}
{"text":"I do a lot of AYCE japanese, and when i see a chinese menu along with an english one, I tend to worry because based on my experience, these places are the \"profit first\" kind of establishments I try to avoid.\"Rip Off\" is a bit too strong a word but thats what it felt like.. They do their subtle alterations to the setup to skew things in their favor.. Here are the highlights of why this place is so horrible

-the maki was terribly made. It looked like something I would make
-the  fish on the sushi was sliced so thinly on top of a lot of rice
-first time ive seen prawn actually sliced in half on a tempura. So one tempura is half a shrimp
-can't order just shrimp tempura, it has to be \"shrimp tempura with vegetables\"
-as expected because other places do this, order an appetizer and you get a considerably large serving
-$15 weekend lunch only for cash, add 5% for any other payment
-1.5 hour dining limit
-automatic 15% \"service charge\" added
-I put a couple of bean sprouts on a small plate to test if my kid would it eat. They tried to charge us a kids meal at 3.99. Before we got the bill I sort of knew they were the type to do this.


$15 is a bit expensive considering spoon and fork which is miles better charges 16.

Man this place is awful. In another world where AYCE doesnt exist theyd be OK.

This is the kind of AYCE that closes down and then reopens with another name. I expect them to be gone soon."}
{"text":"Traveling to multiple sushi restaurants around Ontario, I've stumbled upon Kaze sushi. I've tried this restaurant a few times before deciding on doing a complete review

First off the setting of the restaurant is very nice and has a great tone to in. The washrooms are clean and the decor is nice.

That pretty much sums up the restaurant's pros everything else is just average. The service is slower on most days that I have gone, but the waitresses/waiters are quite friendly

The rolls are definitely over stuffed with way too much rice causing people to get full quick with little condiments actually inside the sushi

The pricing is where it gets a bit iffy, as the price is standard and pretty average but that is only if you pay in CASH. If cash is not used then there is an automatic charge for using any CARD of some sort with a mandatory TIP added after taxes and the extra CARD charge. 

Thus that a is bit ridiculous for a just \"average\" if not below average sushi restaurant.

Not recommended, with many sushi areas and locations around this is not one you'd like to visit

Toronto Food Review"}
{"text":"I went here for AYCE lunch today with coworkers, and it was a terrible experience! 

Kaze has a lot of perks going for it -- huge AYCE menu, tasty food, nice decor...so why the one star? The service was just plain AWFUL. 

Our group of seven arrived just after 12, and the place wasn't too busy at the time (though it started steadily filling up after this). We tried to split our table in half, to make ordering easier. Half of our table started getting food after waiting about 30 minutes, but the other half kept on waiting. Around the 40-minute mark the waiter came over and apologized for the service. Five minutes later, again he apologized again and asked if we wanted to order something else. (Why would we want to order more, when the first round hadn't arrived?) At the 50-minute mark he came back to take our original order AGAGIN. We finally got our food after an hour of waiting. Our lunch break is supposed to be an hour, so factoring in time to get to the resto (it's only 5 min up the street), waiting for food, wolfing back rolls, waiting for the bill...the whole thing took one hour and 45 minutes. 

I've never made a scene at a restaurant, I've never sent food back and I've never asked for a comp meal before. But I came pretty close today. I was pretty surprised that after the wait we didn't even get a coupon or 20% off the meal. Nope. Nothing.

I highly DON'T recommend this place...unless you have 2 hours to kill."}
{"text":"I go here pretty often I am sure the staff recognize me when they see me.  I usually go for lunch since it is cheaper.  Lunch on weekdays is 14dollars.  

my favourites are red dragon, beef teriyaki, yam sushi.  The tea is also really good, and it is free. I used to think all places had free tea but after going to other restaurants I noticed it wasn't."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Its clean and has a nice decor but everything else is just bad. Here's why:

1. After our first round of AYCE, we ordered a second round. 3/5 things we ordered only came and when we asked them about the other food we ordered, they looked confused. I felt like they did this intentionally because the same thing happened the previous time we had eaten there.

2. The employee had been mopping the floors as we were eating. I don't know why but this is really gross. There was the smell of the floor mopping product in the air and it made me really dizzy. Besides this, I glanced at the floor and saw this huge ball of hair and dust collected underneath our table. There goes my appetite. 

3. The servers/employees really don't know any english. This was really frustrating when we wanted to know what exactly was in the rolls since we are not asian and have no clue, and didn't want to waste food.

4. There is a fee, a card charge AND an automatic 15% tip added onto your bill so be aware that the AYCE prices aren't exactly what you'll end up paying when you're done.

5. The ice creams were all freezer burnt. I guess they pre scoop and leave it in their freezer for a really long time, until it's ordered. This also was an issue the previous time we had eaten here. Don't look forward to the dessert.

Try another sushi place!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend always go to the same place for AYCE and decided to try a different place this time. So I chose this place cause I thought it had pretty good reviews. Well, I found it just OK, I wouldn't make the trip up here again though.

The sashimi was very fresh, I'll give them that. Their rolls were poorly made, like another person mentioned. Some were big, small, just inconsistent. Fine. Their dishes are pretty much hit and miss. Breaded scallops were good. Don't order their ramen in soup unless you want to get full off of it. The bowl was so big that it could seriously be a meal on its own. Oh and it was very bland. Ice cream had freezer burn and was really hard. There's a 15% service charge added to the bill and 5% (I believe) surcharge if you pay with another method other than cash. Service was good but nothing spectacular that's worth 15%. 

I've definitely had much better and wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Just letting you all know...Kaze has closed for a while now....Now it is called Yellowtail Japanese restuarant...Still AYCE."}
{"text":"A tried and true staple in my menu. Ever since this place opened a few years ago, this has been the one that everything else gets compared to. 

It is literally a few minutes from my house which always a plus when dining out. The decor is minimal and the seats are too comfortable as they are just wooden bench seats but they make up for it in the food. 

Their menu is a double sided and has everything that you can think of. They even add some special rolls that are unique to their location, honestly not the best but it's something that sets them apart. 

They're pretty good at remember everything you ordered, unless you were talking too fast and they didn't catch it to write it down. The only down side is that if you go on a weekday for lunch, there's only one server and it's the owner and she doesn't speak English very well and when you order, order extremely slow but again everything does come. 

Every time I go somewhere else, I always need to come back to this place as it is like mom's home cooking to me, it may not be the best but when you eat it, you're extremely satisfied."}
{"text":"5 stars. Just like that. BAM! Listen to me, I have an obsession with sushi. I have tried sushi in Europe, sushi in Oakville, in Toronto, Vaughan, Richmond Hill - you name it. 
Actually, my goal in life is to find the perfect AYCE place. This might be it...

First of all - the sashimi pieces are the size of a small child. I can honestly say I ate a whole salmon and a whole tuna to ma face. They also have talapia sashimi and talapia tempura - YUMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

THE GALBI DOESN'T STOP FLOWING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the staff is so nice - I ask for 40 pieces?? Sure! Anything I want - I AM THE KING OF THE SUSHI WORLD!!!!!!!!!

They have mussels - garlic butter and wasabi mussels, which is hard to find in a lot of AYCE places.

They have coconut shrimp - MASSIVE coconut shrimp. It's deep fried to golden perfection and not overly battered. 

Their maki have ONE layer of rice. Max 2. So little rice that I can see the seaweed through it. The pieces are exploding with fish. AMAZING!!!

Spider rolls and Kaze roll are my favorite. I think the Kaze roll is the one with 3 fish in it (salmon, white tuna and red tuna? maybe talapia) - ask them when you get there, some of the rolls have weird names but they are deliciousoooo.


I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO EVERYONE! ANYONE AND EVERYONE! PLEASE GO - don't listen to overly critical reviews. People have unreasonably high expectations for AYCE sushi. Kaze is quality and quantity and FREE POP. And it's relatively cheap - 20.99 for weekday dinner and 22.99 for weekend."}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER
This review is just a repost as this Kaze is the original location. There are 2 Kaze's both the same food and standards.
*************************************************************************************
All you can eat sushi!

I love it. It's one of my favorite things. I've been to many all-you-can-eat sushi places before but none like this. The amount and variety of food they have to offer is astounding.

The decor is very nice. High vaulted ceilings, large windows, clean white booths with light green accents, and green planters. Walking into the restaurant feels light, refreshing, and welcoming.

What's nice about Kaze is you order as you go. Sushi isn't sitting on a train, or at a buffet table. A waiter comes, you order, order more, and more until the act of speaking becomes too strenuous. I find that many all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants have low quality fish and sushi. Kaze's quality even dwarfs some stand alone a la carte sushi restaurants with their freshness and quality rolls. I'm sure that the order as you go method helps keep their quality standards high as the sushi isn't just sitting waiting to be eaten.

They have so many items from beef sukiyaki to popcorn chicken. Their specialty rolls are great. The Fire Dragon Roll is a spider roll topped with spicy salmon and is a hit with those that like raw fish and also those that don't. Plenty of sake is on tap and everything is made fresh to order. Fish shipments come in every morning so freshness is always guaranteed. 

Their beef teriyaki is a must try. Thinly sliced beef, green peppers, and onions, in a teriyaki sauce that isn't thick or overly sweet.

Overall, Kaze has set the bar for all-you-can-eat sushi places and it has set it very high. Quality, quantity, and price are all very pleasing. Of all my travels, I have yet to come across any all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant of this quality.

*Note* Sashimi is not part of all-you-can-eat menu during lunch."}

{"text":"food is good - but service can use some work, which is too bad because they automatically add a gratuity service charge of 15%"}
{"text":"Its really good but some of their meats can be better like sirloin steak and beef teryiaki and ribs. Sushi is good, but some is not that great. Overall good."}
{"text":"Many things have passed my expectations but minus one star because there's only one worker running around the place. For an all you can eat the variety isn't much to choose from. But the food is good here compared to most of the all you can eats. I come back whenever I'm craving for sushi with a huge appetite!"}
{"text":"food was average, service was at best uninterested (that is because the automatically add15%, rip off!)"}
{"text":"Now called AKIMI and is still and AYCE.  New owners - we dined early evening so there weren't many people and that showed in terms of the chefs taking time to create good quality food, for an AYCE."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight. It was pretty empty, but then again, it was a Tuesday night. Dinner is All You Can Eat ($19.99 M-Th, $21.99 F-Su). You can order whatever you want from the laminated sheet. Most likely it will be available, sometimes it won't be and some items are seasonal. They have a lot of choices. It's kind of overwhelming. I had a curry chicken don, miso soup. For rolls, dynamite, red dragon, kaze, 16th, woodbine, and others. For sashimi, white tuna and salmon. And other stuff. I don't even know what else. Anyway, we also had ice cream at the end. The ice cream comes in single serving sizes that are pre scooped and stuck in a freezer. 

My gripe with this place is that we could have seen the servers a bit more often. They would come by to refill tea, but not to take more orders. The food did come out quickly, but we could have eaten more. 

So there is some fine print on the menu. There is a 10% gratuity added to the bill. If you don't pay cash, 5% gets tacked on to the price. And there is a 1.5 hour maximum. However, they didn't enforce it on this Tuesday night. 

Okay, so for all you can eat, I can deal."}
{"text":"I went to Kaze Japanese Cuisine for AYCE on a Sunday evening. 

I really like the decoration, the booth seatings and the high ceiling! The theme colour of Green does give the restaurant a nice and sedating feel.

The sushi and the sashimi were all fresh and tasty. I like how they did not try to put a lot of rice in their hand rolls and sushi like other AYCE restaurant.

However, their cooked dishes do have room for improvement. I found them really salty. I did mention to the waitress, she said there is only 1 person in the kitchen so that's why the quality control of the food sometimes can be off.

The ramen is quite tasty though.. I ate 2 bowels of that.. :)

Don't try to order Seasame ice cream! They don't have it! I ask why not? They said since no one is ordering it so they are not going to stock that.. GEE, no seasame ice cream?? However I do recommend the coconut ice cream, It is really tasty with big chunks of real coconut inside!

The soft drinks are not fountain drinks! They are reallly can drinks! I though not drinking pop anymore, but I found canned ones are so much better than the one from the fountain!

The food might arrive slowly because there are only 1 sushi chef and 1 cook and 2 wait staffs.

Please note the hours which is different from what they post on the website! They close at 9 PM on Sunday and weekdays!

Please beware that they charge 10% tips on top of your bills automatically, so don't double tip!

They do offer a la carte menu with bento box and sushi set for lunch special."}
{"text":"I usually shy away from all you can eat sushi because of my small appetite. However, once in awhile, I would make an exception for Kaze because I love their wide selection of food and I really enjoy their sashimi. 

Things that I like to order:
salmon sashimi...loads and loads of it!
Crispy dragon roll
Dragon roll
Spicy salmon roll
Breaded scallop
Popcorn chicken

In particular, I love their selection of ice cream flavours! They offer green tea, mango, ginger, coconut, red bean, and chocolate. The coconut and ginger flavours are standouts, because they contain bits of coconut and ginger in the ice cream. Even the chocolate flavour here is better than your average grocery-store bought chocolate ice cream. I always end off my meal with multiple servings of ice cream! We really go nuts for the ice cream."}
{"text":"We went to Kaze for an All-You-Can-Eat lunch on a Friday, and were very disappointed.  

While, the place was not too busy, our server forgot our orders serveral times.  

Worst of all, I haven't ever had sushi that I was so disappointed in before.  The maki rolls and nigiri had an over-abundance of rice.  I have eaten at many other all-you-can-eat sushi places, but never have I seen so much rice and so little anything else.  What's more, the quality of the fish was very pedestrial too.

Shrimp tempura seemed like it had stayed in the fryer 2 minutes longer than it should have.

At the end we order ice-cream, which was brought out rock-hard.  We spent several minutes chiseling, stabbing away at it until it finally softened enough for you to be able to eat it."}
