{"text":"A tremendous value.  Dined there after the lunch rush...when you expect the crew to be inattentive because they are focused on side duties.  We experienced an attentive server and good timing of the food from the kitchen.  The food was quite good.  Two types of salsa and fresh/ hot chips arrived right away.  Drinks came promptly and the server was both friendly and patient as we took our time choosing from the extensive menu.  We had heuvos rancheros, chalupas and a quesadilla.  Everything tasted great...not exactly like our on our trips to Mexico but a lot closer than most places around LKN.  The place is pleasant and clean.  All-in-all worth becoming your go-to Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican food in the area! I haven't tried a single menu item I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"Great menu and portion sizes.  I particularly like their hot salsa. I have been about 5 times and have never had a bad experience.  Not overpriced at all. Only negative is limited parking,  but they can't control that. There's some outdoor seating (contrary to my answer to the question)."}
{"text":"Thank you my fellow Yelper's who suggested this place. It was fantastic! Clean, inexpensively priced, great service, and the food oh the food....   They delivered the standard chips and salsa to the table and it came with a hot salsa option. My favorite, the hotter the better. It was excellent and I haven't even gotten to the entree yet. The guacamole .... very good. Followed all that up with a swan dive into my Chicken Tacos (I battled getting the Chicken Tortas - Mexican Sandwich). It was awesome and for 1.69 each how can you go wrong. Topping off this off with a cold Corona and what do you get...? I'll tell you my friends.... Bliss - that's what!   I never would have tried this place had I it not been for all the 5 star reviews because from the outside it doesn't look like much. La Unica means \"The One\" and in the Huntersville area it certainly is for me."}
{"text":"So I discovered this place 2 weeks ago, and have eaten there 4 times since, which should pretty much say it all. Ever since coming back to the states after living 2 years in Veracruz, Mexico, I'm always on the hunt for a legit taco place. The first time at La Unica I ordered one of each taco they had, and the Carnitas stood out among the rest. Personally I prefer Al Pastor, and while their's was good, it wasn't anything to rave about. But with one bite of the Carnitas I was teleported back to the streets of Veracruz. I have not tasted such authentic carnitas this side of the Rio Bravo. I wish I could review the rest of the menu, but all I've had in my subsequent visits has been either carnitas tacos of burritos. For the restaurant itself, the service is great, fast, and the pricing is very reasonable. Also, take-out is the way to go during the business hours. I called my order in on a busy Saturday night, and it was ready for me when I got there 10 mins later, complete with chips, salsa, cut limes, sauteed onions and jalapenos. Just like they do it in Veracruz."}
{"text":"Their carnitas are fantastic!    I highly recommend them for a casual mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent ! Food and Service !   Went there for the first time with sister and husband.  upon the yelp reviews.  Its true. the food and service. was great.  Everything fresh and tasty.  Prices was reasonable. What more can u ask for great food, service and price.  I ordered the combination plate of burrito, taco and enchilada.  delicious!.   My sister ordered the Flan for dessert.  OMG ! so fresh and delious ! Excellent, Excellent place for mexican food."}
{"text":"The food is good - much better than average for a Mexican diner.  I assumed when I went in for the first time that the interior would be better than the dingy shopping center in which it is located.  I was wrong.  The dining room is one large open area, cheaply appointed.  The wait staff is surely all related to the owner.  No one with that little personality could possibly keep the job.  The night we were there, the dining room was uncomfortably hot.  It was not a particularly hot evening, so I would be concerned that the air conditioning never does what it needs to do.  But, the food was good.  The salsa and chips delivered to the table when we sat down were very good - the chips were fresh and the salsa was well-seasoned and had fresh ingredients.  The sangria wine also was very good.  I had burritos and my wife had quesadillas, and they all were very well prepared.  The place was packed at 6:00 on a Wednesday, and it could only be the food drawing that crowd.  I might opt for takeout next time."}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food.  Excellent salsa.  If you like hot salsa to dip your chips ask for the green salsa, they won't automatically bring it out you have to ask.   Its made with avocado and jalape√±o.  It's quite spicy! The authentic tacos are my fav.  Excellent !"}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant. We eat here every Friday night. The cheese dip is wonderful! The margaritas are yummy. Get a pitcher."}
{"text":"I am a SUCKER for their tacos.  its the only thing i get- not including the guac and sangria :)  (I am not big on saucey american mexican food). prepare to wait a few minutes as this place is packed all hours of the day."}
{"text":"First of all some genius decided that during busy dinner hour was a good time to paint stripes in the parking lot!  Go figure! Then I sat and watched several people get their chips and salsa before me. Good thing I was watching that rather than some guy bleed all over himself on the UFC. Very appetizing indeed. Sort of like a bullfight.  Service continues to go down hill since the genius that is painting the lot forgot to order Negra Modelo. At least the waitress has quit calling me honey. When the food was slid in front of me unceremoniously the portions has obviously been cut from the old.location. So the food is OK, prices are up, portions are down, noise is LOUD and the service is poor."}
{"text":"I Love the food, the place is comfy, parking is free and it is in close to uptown!"}
{"text":"A week doesn't go by that I don't eat here... or dream of eating here. After many, MANY visits, I can say... every single time I have eaten here, the food has been delicious and the wait staff is friendly. The restaurant is beautifully, newly decorated. What a find! And thank you, Victor, for all the FUN!!"}
{"text":"I have searched for a great Mexican restaurant in the Charlotte area for awhile.  I love this place.  The food is fresh and flavorful.  The staff are really nice and they're super helpful when trying to decide what to order.  Don't let the location turn you off!  It's in a weird place but well worth it!"}
{"text":"The food is very good and fairly inexpensive.  Drink specials daily with a full bar available. We like the daily specials."}
{"text":"BEST Mexican in Charlotte, period.    Everything I've had here has been outstanding.  I recommend the \"no name dinner\", it's a little of everything, and is amazing."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Mexican food!  Delicious food, low prices, good service. Ask about drinks specials - the margaritas are always great, and their version of LIT's are awesome too. Try not to fill up on the chips and salsa before you order your entree!"}
{"text":"excellent! great food!  Waiters may not be fluent in English. :)"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around. They moved to the old cheeseburger in paradise and are crowed every time that I've been there. You won't regret it"}
{"text":"This is the best. I have learned to enjoy watching Mexican cable TV. You can order a light lunch or what you want with no problem. Be prepared to wait for a table ."}
{"text":"Regular Mexican food nothing special I got fried fish n shrimp the batter wasn't that good n it came with rice n french fries ... My friend had skirt steak she loved but the place to me is not one of the best Mexican places I've ate at. Lots of ppl sit outside to eat n everything was made quickly."}
{"text":"I am updating this review because I have noticed that it might be a cultural difference that cleaning and sweeping may take place near you having your meal in a Mexican restaurant. I have had it occur in another restaurant but I am not quite comfortable with it."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican restaurants I have eaten at in Charlotte. Since moving here from Austin, TX we have found our supply of Mexican food! We have been twice (so far) and the waitresses have been very nice and helpful. The manager always comes by and asks how we are and how the food is.   The Fajita Nachos was very good, just eat them fast as they will get soggy. The Burrito Mexicano (chicken) is my favorite."}
{"text":"Amazing Chicken Tacos! Get them La Unica style. Quality authentic Mexican food for great prices."}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly service. We were seated and eating within 10 minutes on a Saturday night with multiple events in town. The food was fresh and delicious. There's not much to say, it's just a great, simple Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Great location, the restaurant looks new and neat clean. the price is right, the food is awesome and the staff is very friendly. We are definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the area, hands down. All the favorable Yelp reviews steered me here (thanks fellow Yelpers!), and I wasn't disappointed! I'll agree with the previous reviews - HUGE margaritas (I prefer mine on the rocks), fresh salsa & chips while waiting. But you won't wait long, even when crowded (which is pretty common, this place is popular), service is always quick. And the food is delish!   Don't be fooled by the unassuming strip mall location, trust me :-)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I discovered this place a few weeks ago (thanks to the favorable Yelp reviews), and since then it's become one of our favorite dinner date destinations.  It's not a huge space, so there can be a wait during peak dinner hours, but it's never very long and totally worth it.  So far we've had:  Chips and salsa: typical of a Mexican restaurant, but here they give you two types of salsa; one smoky and spicy and the other mild.  No Name Dinner: excellent in terms of both quality AND quantity.  My boyfriend and I split the plate and still had leftovers.  All their tacos.  Very authentic, served on two corn tortillas, garnished with cilantro and onions only.  The pastor (pork) was the best, followed by the asado (beef).  The barbacoa was good too.  Chicken enchiladas: delicious, and packed with chicken.  The creamy cheese on top and the smoky red sauce are heavenly.  Large margarita: when they say \"grande\" they mean it!  It's huge!  But nice and tart, not overly sweet.  I had mine on the rocks, and definitely shared it.  Service is friendly and efficient.  Prices are excellent for what you receive.  We love this place!"}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm giving the restaurant a 3 star is because of the long wait for us to get our food & the check. The food was absolutely delicious, the menu is extensive with chocked available & the prices are decent. My only complain is with the server and the service provided."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! Real authentic food with great flavor. Their chips and salsa are delicious too! Staff is always friendly! Food comes out hot and fresh!  Best little restaurant in harrisburg :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican food!, Prices are cheap for quality food. I've been going here for lunch very often, sometimes a few times in a week. Their lunch specials are a bargain for the amount of food you get.  The authentic tacos are also incredible and even the salsas they give you with the chips are great and noticeably fresh. The staff are very kind and always on top of things. I've never had to wait long for the food to come out even on busy days and its always come out hot from the kitchen."}
{"text":"\"One of my least favorite Mexican restaurants thus far. Salsa tasted like canned tomato sauce, food was pretty bland. Might try one more time to give them 2nd chance at redemption.\""}
{"text":"Ate there this Saturday night and the place was slammed.  I will say it again, I wish Yelp would let you choose 1/2 stars because I would be at 4.5.  The food was great and value priced.  The service was not great, like I said the place was slammed so I am taking that into consideration.  I drink unsweet tea and a server came by and filled me up with sweet tea, it took 10 minutes for me to get someones attention and get it switched out.  Minor hiccup.  Food was really good and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I stopped by La Unica based on the strong recommendations found here - and overall, it was worth it.  I placed a take-out order at the front desk - but the waiter was very slow writing down my order. I'm not kidding when I say it took him a minute-plus to write down what kind of burrito I wanted. It was a bit awkward standing there so long. Also, he missed a side (guacamole) but that is fine.  Regardless, the wait was not too long and I took my food back to my hotel across the street.  The ingredients were fresh and the taste was above average, however, the burrito was very soggy. I could not even lift it up to eat it - which made for a very messy meal.   The food was authentic and delicious - so I would definitely go again if I am in the area but be sure to try El Paraiso in Cornelius, as well.   FYI - they do not take AMEX."}
{"text":"A-mazing!  I've lived in Charlotte for over three years and was wondering how and where to get some great Mexican food.  This is it!    I went there for lunch today and the place was absolutely packed.  Nevertheless, I was promptly seated and delivered my drink.  I ordered (the Crazy Burrito with chicken) and the service was prompt.    The food?  Delicious.  So much so that I was using the chips to scrape up every piece of rice and cheese on my plate.  And the price points were excellent!  No need to go for fast food anymore (I work in Birkdale Village)...I'm going to head to La Unica for my lunch break!  :)"}
{"text":"Fresh fast friendly, carnitas were awesome! There is a reason this place is full. People know a good thing."}
{"text":"Best authentic tacos in town! From some former Californians, we were disappointed in Charotte's Mexican cuisine, but were pleasantly surprised with La Unica. I recommend the tacos to anyone and everyone and am glad we found our new favorite taco spot."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and convinced some coworkers to join me. This is not our normal Mexican restaurant,but after today I think is will be. Great food and good prices. Also noticed plenary of first responders having lunch both times I've gone and they usually find the best places first."}
{"text":"Loved this place today during lunch! Not too busy and great food. Avocado delight was a great appetizer for 2 and no carb."}
{"text":"My husband and I were on vacation from NY and decided that we wanted Mexican but the place we went to our last visit in NC had closed (I think it was called Monterey's). So we saw this rinky dink strip mall and assumed that it oils probably suck as so many strip mall eateries from where we are usually do BUT after all the great reviews we decided to give it a try at lunch.  WELL......looks are deceiving! It was a rather small place nothing special but the food was awesome. Their Queso is tasty, my burrito tiajuana was great and the husband had fajitas which he also enjoyed. Don't discount this place for its location, the food was pretty decent and our waitress was pretty attentive. We will definitely go back the next visit to Huntersville!"}
{"text":"AVERAGE GOOD FOOD, NO BAR, KIDS GALORE!    So maybe you're OK with all the kids if you have kids, but if you're looking for a Mexican place that has a bar, less kids, and something with a bit more ambiance, go elsewhere.    FOOD:  Average neighborhood Mexican food.  Not bad, but no better in my opinion than any other generic Mexican place. Large portions, mostly tasty, on par with every other \"burrito, beans, rice\" Mexican place.   Awesome very hot flavorful picante salsa available upon request.  AMBIANCE:  I kind of felt like I was in a room setup for a wedding reception.  Stark walls with boring decorations and one whole wall with all mirrors to give the illusion of this place being larger, since it's such a small place.    NO BAR!  It's been a while since I've been to a Mexican place that doesn't have a bar for waiting.  So, you crowd the front table trying to eat with people waiting to sit down.  Not my idea of a fun waiting space.  Note that they do serve beer and wine at the tables, there's just no bar.    SERVICE:  Attentive and polite service and well worth a good 18-20% tip.    Overall, not my kind of place but the food and service are good...average Mexican food, but good.    Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant. Excellent food, great service, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"ENVIRONMENT Authentic.  Nothing fancy, it won't impress but I felt at home.  Didn't notice the sanitation score but it felt clean. Very well run, they are paying attention to the details. FOOD Really good.  Everybody in the family had something different & loved it.  Got to try the tacos!  My favorite is pastor. SERVICE Fast & friendly, helpful, honest.  Nothing fancy. VALUE Excellent! BOTTOM LINE Not your average Mexican diner - should definitely be on your list."}
{"text":"The server sat us promptly upon our arrival and asked for our drink orders. Another server came with two types of salsa and a big bowl of chips. Chips were hot. One flavor salsa was a little bland while the other had great heat that lingered in your mouth. That's the type of heat that feels good. :) We ordered cheese dip, beef taco, enchilada, beef burrito and chicken burrito. OMGISH CHEESE DIP!!!! Amazing! My fiancee kept on scooping spoonfuls of cheese on everything! The beef taco was a little under seasoned. The sauce on the burritos were delicious. The chicken was well seasoned. We would come back to get our Mexican fix again."}
{"text":"We go frequently to La Unica and are NEVER disappointed. The food is authentic and delicious. Another visit tonight and the food was great along with amazing service. Try the house tacos the chorizo and lengua are excellent."}
{"text":"Once was enough.  I  thought the salsa was bland and the food followed.  My husband  enjoyed his meal more than I."}
{"text":"This is exactly what we excepted. The food was good, salsa and chips arent the best but I have had worse. I went in with the mind set of my previous Loco Lime experience and it was very similar. I was very please with the staff, they were  awesome with our kids! It is a casual Mexican restaurant with decent food at reasonable prices.   Food is good, staff was great and the overall experience met our average expectation. It's not fine dining but somewhere between taco bell and Azteca."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Los Angeles, so I know authentic Mexican food.  Yeah, I know, total cliche but it's true.  And I can tell you that this place reminds me of home.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Family and I love this place, we're from El Paso, and so we sort of know Mexican food, and this place does do.  I order many items, my favorites are the Guisado (?) it's a fiery and and I mean Fiery stew of pork, and sausage...I love it but it's not for the newbie to Mexican fare.  The tacos are real (not Taco Bell style) but real, with linqua, or al carbon, etc.... I really love the salsa verde, made with tomatillos, avacado, etc...you have to ask for it.  They also do tamales which are great, only wish they didn't always serve them with sauce and cheese (not how we ate them in Texas)."}
{"text":"Loved it and continue to love it.  The food is always good and is a good value.  They are often busy but move the crowds effectively."}
{"text":"This place ALWAYS get orders WRONG!. I ordered a CARNITAS burrito and I get CHICKEN. I say CHEESE SAUCE they give me SHREDDED CHEESE!. So they put shredded cheese inside the burrito and then send a bowl or shredded cheese on the side. IT WASNT A HARD ORDER TO GET!. Second time I order from this place, my coworker was going to go and I forgot my lunch at home so i had no choice. I called and they said to bring it back and ill get a refund.. well it is now completely out of my way and the whole reason my coworker went was because I obviously couldn't! NEVER AGAIN WILL I ORDER FROM THERE!"}
{"text":"Let's keep a secret.... We all know how great this place is, and now that its moving, lets not tell others so we can have this fantastic eatery all to ourselves."}
{"text":"This is by far the Mexican place in the area.  I can't wait for them to open the bigger spot so we won't have to wait as long to be seated.  It gets a little crazy bringing a 3 and 1 year old.  The food is great though.  I've never had anything I haven't liked."}
{"text":"The food is great, the service is fast and the prices are fair, I recommend it if you're in the Charlotte/Harrisburg area."}
{"text":"Had to check it up from the positive yelp reviews & they did not dissapoint. The place was packed at lunch on a Wednesday and service was fast & friendly. Good prices for good food."}
{"text":"Go to spot for good Mexican food in Harrisburg. I usually get authentic tacos with horchata to drink. The fried fish is good too."}
{"text":"Food is authentic and very good, service is fast, most waitresses need a new personality. They are all angry at the world."}
{"text":"For authentic Mexican tacos, this is one of the few places that exist in the Charlotte metro area. The toppings are minimal (cilantro and diced onions) and accompaniments are unique (roasted jalape√±o and young onions). Most places would shy away from having beef tongue on their menus (freaks out the uninitiated patrons). I've had tongue before, but it was marinated and sauteed. The cooking style here is more basic but good. The avocado salad is great but slightly misleading as a name. It's basically halves of avocado with pico de gallo on top. I still enjoy it. Just be sure to ask if you're not sure about menu items. The servers are very helpful."}
{"text":"La Unica is a great Taco Tuesday spot. The service is fast and friendly, especially Ron. The tacos aut√©nticos have a large variety to choose from, plus they're only a dollar and delicious! If the house margarita doesn't do it for you, I highly recommend the jalape√±o margarita if you can handle the spice. While the mild and spicy salsas are great, queso is a must."}
{"text":"We go here several times a month! It's a great family friendly place to eat. The food is always great the salsa is fantastic! Can get a little busy and it's small but that's the only downside to this place. Love it! My 4 year olds favorite place to eat!"}
{"text":"Love La Unica. Consistently good food. Breakfast served all day, too. Be sure to try their authentic soft tacos - carnitas and pastor are really good."}
{"text":"Since my last review, visited several more times. The food is still delicious (as usual) and I must say the service has improved significantly! I've had the pleasure of both dining in and ordering togo and I really don't have any complaints. Good job La Unica, I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"What can i say, great food, great drink specials and great service!! Suggestions here: fajitas, all the tacos are great but make sure you have \"a la unica\", nachos are good and make sure you ask for the margarita pitcher :) also try the hibiscus juice \"Agua de Jamaica\" definitely a great spot your in and out quick."}
{"text":"This is my husband's favorite Charlotte-area Mexican place and the only one we go to now. (He's from El Paso and picky about his Mexican food.) La Unica is one of the few places around here that we found that has menudo -- not a plus especially for me, but hey, I'm not from Texas.  There is always a crowd and the staff are very good at seating people quickly and are patient with kids. I tend to get burritos and they are quite good here,  as are the dishes that are not so utilitarian."}
{"text":"Cinco de Mayo at La Unica-Plaza Midwood was, hands down, the WORST dining experience of my life.  We were going with a fairly large group (10 people), so my friend called and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Whoever she talked to said \"no problem\" and gave her the impression that a reservation was scheduled. She later emailed La Unica to confirm the reservation and received no response. Therefore, she went to the restaurant in person to confirm the reservation and was told no reservations would be taken for Cinco de Mayo. I don't know if the original person she talked to had a language barrier or a policy was not set in a timely manner, but that should not have occurred. She asked what we should do to get seating and they told her just arrive 15-20 minutes early.  Our group arrived at the restaurant at 6:15 and were not seated until 7:45. By that point, we were starving and in bad moods. We were also annoyed that our original reservation was not honored. The reason it took so long to get seated is because there were only specific booths that would accommodate our group (which ended up being 7 people) and other customers were lingering. Restaurant staff should have politely explained the situation to those guests to motivate them to stand up or leave. We also presented alternate options to get seated faster such as pushing other tables together or splitting our group up and our suggestions were brushed off by the hostesses.  Once we got a table, some of us had to stand and wait while they scrounged up some chairs for us. Our table was also slanted and only stayed straight if I leaned on it.  Once we were seated, it took 45 minutes to get our drinks after asking about them 2-3 times. We asked the waitress approximately 3 times to please take our food order and she kept saying \"in a minute\" or \"please wait.\" So, we did not get to put our orders in until about 8:45 p.m. People who were seated after us got their food before us. By 9:45, we had not received our food and just asked for our food to be boxed and for our checks to be brought.  At one point, I presented the above facts to a manager. She did not seem particularly concerned and did not do anything to remedy the situation. Talking to us or comping some of our food would have been nice. Instead, the overworked waitress muttered some half-hearted apology.  After waiting an obscene amount of time for food and checks, we eventually got up and left the restaurant. We did not want to just walk out like that, but we felt we had no choice, having lives and jobs to attend to.  So, in sum, we were at La Unica nearly four hours and were seated for over two hours with NO FOOD. I understand it was busy and a holiday, but it was beyond ridiculous! It left a bad taste in my mouth.   We left extremely disappointed, woozy, and hangry. We would have been better off with some lime-a-ritas and Taco Bell in a parking lot."}
{"text":"I had the chicken taco salad. The lunch size . It was perfect for me because I eat small portions. My husband had chicken nachos. Very good, fresh and tasty. We like this place and we will be back ."}
{"text":"The food was decent..the waitresses weren't very talkative however..i heard a lot about La Unica but i didn't see the hype..maybe i'll order something else next time.."}
{"text":"This place is great! Not your run of the mill affordable Mexcian restaurant. The food is fresh and delicious!  You must check it out. Can't beat the price and the quality."}
{"text":"Best pastor( pork )  tacos around nc. Closest thing I have had to real Mexican food since I've left Cali."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever!! And the menudo is soooo good! The staff is sweet, efficient and very friendly! Definitely my go-to place for some amazing authentic tacos :)"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in the greater Charlotte area. Mexican food is built around the salsa, and La Unica is as good as it gets. Inexpensive and timely service.  Just ignore the fact that there logo is a hispanic version of the Wendy's girl."}
{"text":"I'd give it 3 stars compared to 3 Amgio's and sabor, but I'll be nice here.  4-5 star tacos, great salsa, and reasonable prices on everything else.  Not too much to hate on.  If in this area, I won't go here on a normal basis, as I do like the other places I mentioned above.  But the southside and northside La Unica's are my favorites in those areas.  All the locations have the same salsa and tacos, and that's really all I go for.  Its cheap, its easy, and its good.  What else do you need.  I certainly don't need some weird shrimp dish or something with a super rich cream sauce.  Service is friendly, food is good enough, you just won't find me at this location very often.  I hope you guys are happy with that 4th star, I thought twice."}
{"text":"I would typically give a place like this 3 stars, but it's surprisingly difficult to find 'standard' mexican restaurants this close to uptown.  Also, does anyone else think this is just Loco Lime with a name change?  They even have the toy vending machines...."}
{"text":"A solid choice for Mexican in the Lake Norman area.  The food is a mix of typical mexican fair both authentic and tex mex.  The business is family owned and I find a great deal of care and love goes into how they serve their customers.    The quality, consistency, and flavor of every  meal is very good after dozens of visits.  Something not typical to most mexican restaurants.  You'll find the ambiance is not upscale but not bad.  Small strip mall exterior and interior.  Great place to enjoy a meal in a casual no frills family friendly atmosphere.  My favorite dishes on the menu are authetic tacos, and fajitas.  Great quality ingredients and well flavored.   The salsas offered are very good and homemade as well - make sure you get the salsa verde (green stuff) if they won't bring it out by default and you appreciate heat!  Drinks are good.  I'm picky about my margaritas and the tequila that goes in them.  The team here never disappoints.  Finally,  service is excellent on a consistent basis.  Nice people that truly love their customers.  Give La Unica a try.  It's one of my favorite mexican restaurants in the country."}
{"text":"This is the BEST mexican in Charlotte. We have tried a few. More than a few. And this is hands down the best. It is a little dive-y but thats what makes it great. Ask for Carolina. She's the most amazing, sweetest waitress. And get the salsa verde (it's free! just ask!) - its an avocado based salsa that will blow your mind."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant! Sandy is an amazing server and is always using anticipated service by bringing the things we like to compliment our meals. Thank you La Unica for delicious food!"}
{"text":"Local staple that pretty much got me through high school. The food is delicious and consistent plus the staff is great! There is very rarely a wait and I have never seen it dirty in all my years of eating there. Great place for a family meal, I would know because my family goes there all the time!"}
{"text":"My 'Taco Tuesday' hidden gem is not so hidden anymore. They still will bust their rears to get you in and seated, it just might take a bit getting through the 12 people in front of your first.  Full disclosure: I've only been here for Taco Tuesdays ($1). Parking here can be tricky -- several time's I've had to wait for cars to leave. Be patient, it's worth the wait.   Tacos: Al pastor is probably my favorite, followed by the barbacoa & the regular pollo. Chorizo is also decent, but not as good as the others. Serving size is pretty solid -- you'll get a heaping pile of meat, cilantro & onion severed on two corn tortillas. Queso is as to be expected, and the chips & salsas are pretty top notch.  Pro Tip: ask for the green salsa. it's like a cilantro-y avocado blend, maybe? Spicy & delicious."}
{"text":"Great service and the best Mexican food.  If you like spicy, ask for the green salsa when they bring you your chips - it's so hot, but has tons of flavor.  So far I've tried the steak fajitas and a lunch special (#3) chile relleno and a taco.  The margaritas are good, too.  This will be a regular place on my list."}
{"text":"Good, standard Mexican fare. The tortillas are very good! They hold together well and are not too thick. I liked the quesadilla el pastor and the trio of salsas they offer. I would come back to try other dishes, but I cannot say this is a stand-out place. Not yet."}
{"text":"Understaffed, horrible service and service staff has attitude. Which is sad bc it has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Yay!!! We finally found *that* taco place!! Good, cheap tacos with plenty of chips and salsa. Love that they bring 2 types of salsa out right away. One is spicier and chunky, yet totally fresh and the other is your usual mild, thinner salsa - perfect for kids or sensitive pallets. Service was good and fast. Asada tacos were perfect! Definately recommend!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this family owned business. I love the super authentic food and family atmosphere. The prices are inexpensive and the portion sizes are great. They always have the best customer service and I love their new location. I've spoken to the owner a few times and now he approaches me every time I come in. Love it! I love feeling right at home. Oh yea and they have the best margaritas!!"}
{"text":"Best mexican in the area!  Flautas are one of my favorites and hard to find - - around here at least.  Everything is fresh, served fast and very nice staff.  A friend steered me here a few weeks ago - it's next to a grocery store and I would never have tried it without a recommendation.  I've heard that the fajitas are a big favorite also... I don't think you can go wrong with this place - and cheap!!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Mexican food gods, for bringing me La Unica. After years of trying (and failing) to find good quality, affordable Mexican food, I finally struck gold. La Unica is a magical little neighborhood gem with delicious offerings and friendly staff. It's no wonder that there always seems to be a line out the door at this place!   Their guacamole is fresh, they bring mild and spicy salsa to the table to satisfy everyone's palate, and their enchiladas are covered in a heavenly mole. I could eat their chicken hard tacos every day. This is exactly what Mexican food should be: straightforward, high quality, fresh, and non-pretentious.  I'm so excited that they're moving into a building of their own where they can shine and hopefully accommodate a larger crowd. I'll be one of their regulars for sure!"}
{"text":"The food and service were both amazing! My husband got the #1 combination and cleaned his entire plate. I had the Enchilada Supreme or something like that. It was one chicken, one beef, and one bean enchilada and they were all delicious. Our server Jose was very attentive and kind and provided excellent service! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love their authentic tacos and hibiscus tea. It's a frequent stop for us on the weekends."}
{"text":"Pros: $1 tacos on Tuesday, free chips and salsa, the tacos come out fast and are always filling   Cons: they take a long time to give you the check, wanted my change (so I can tip properly and never got it)  Other than that I love the place, I frequent when I can, mainly Tuesday's lol but I'd recommend this place to anyone, only took a star off for the cons. A lot of construction workers eat here but that's not a an issue honestly."}
{"text":"Great place for the family, and it's super clean. Great service, awesome food. Never disappoint us when we come here. Love to come here when the weather is nice, and sit outside. Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some good food, and a great environment. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very popular joint that will be relocating soon due to the shopping center remodeling project that doesn't evolve the restaurant. If you order anything that is straight cheese beware it's a very rich white cheese."}
{"text":"Another fabulous La Unica location - this time in Huntersville! I've already raved about how much I love La Unica in Indian Trail (http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-unica-indian-trail?hrid=k7k5Y6bYLU3iOZF9o7V7NA)  this is location is part of the same restaurant family.   The food and service is just as good and just as fast - as well as just as busy! I tried venturing out of my comfort zone and ordered something else.  This time it was the queso fundido con chorizo - oh my was that tasty!  But tried and true, I ordered my carnitas and it did not disappoint.  Try La Unica - you won't be sorry - it truly is the best Mexican spot in Charlotte (north and south!)"}
{"text":"Tried out the new La Unica as a taco tuesday replacement since it is in the former Loco Lime location. Bland, tasteless, is the only way I can describe it. Maybe you can get more from something other than $1 tacos, but it seems a step down from the restaurant it replaces."}
{"text":"At first I started eating here because it is so close to my house. Now I keep coming back because it is darn good mexican food.  The parking lot is a little scary with massive potholes, but considering how some other restaurants nearby have such little parking I'll take the washed out gravel pit.  If you have a low rider you may want to be careful though.  They bring out 2 bottles of salsa, 1 hot and 1 mild.  The hot is too hot and the mild is too mild but when I mix them together (75% mild, 25% hot) I get a salsa that has a kick but is still edible.  I'm not a heat seeker so I'm sure some would find the hot salsa to be fairly mild.  The chips are thick and have good flavor.  I've had a few things on the menu and I have been happy. Never too salty or too bland which seems to be how some Mexican restaurants are.  I will be back many more times."}
{"text":"Excellent, attentive, quick service and TONS of menu choices!  Everything was delicious and hot right out of the kitchen!  Definitely going back to try other goodies"}
{"text":"I could simply kick myself for just finding out about this place!  I am in love with the taco's here...L-O-V-E.....love!  They're just so darn good the authentic corn tortilla taco's as well as the homemade hard shell taco's, plus the salsa.....omg!  Please know that if it were not bathing suit season you would see oh so much more of me but never fear, I'll be a regular come October because you are truly as your name suggest.....'the one and only'!"}
{"text":"We just LOVE this place! My husband and I come once a week. The staff is great and the food is amazing! Authentic Mexican for sure. We love the carne asada. Love the chips and salsa. The coconut margarita is a must-have!   The owner works the bar and is great. The place is super clean, which is always nice. For real authentic Mexican on this side of town, La Unica is the spot. Nice patio and lots of TV's too."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mexican restaurant for a sit down meal. I typically go on Taco Tuesdays, but I am always sucked into the menu and get one of the entrees. It's $1 tacos in Tuesdays.  My favorite is the yolandas. Three chicken enchiladas either ranchero sauce and served with rice and guacamole salad. The portion is HUGE. I love their salsas as well. They seat you with a mild and a hot (and I mean hot) salsa, but you can ask for a creamy, spicy green salsa as well. The staff is always super friendly and make it enjoyable to eat there. To top it all off, the prices are super low even on the mains. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Came here on Taco Tuesday. Def one of her best taco Tuesday's. Their tacos are only $1 with a small up charge for sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes. The  barbacoa taco and the chorizo taco are a must have. The margaritas where huge and at a good price. Service could of been a little bit better.    We were told to order the green sauce when they give u chips and salsa. It's great and only for spicy lovers like me!"}
{"text":"I've been here for a few Taco Tuesdays, and I kind of think they need to get it together. The first time we arrived early in the evening and they were somehow already out of all salsa other than the hot stuff. Service otherwise was decent at best that visit. Second and third time not so much. Took a while for our server to approach us. There was a lot of confusion between whoever took our drink order and who our server was, thus delaying it even more. Chips came out before any plates or drinks were on the table, noticed this was a pattern across the restaurant. Maybe having a simple water and chip runner when the table is seated would be a good idea. The server forgot to put our appetizer in... I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt being that I have worked in the industry, but the queso app (it's queso, it doesn't take that long) came out after our entrees and when she brought the check she told us that she hadn't added the app to the check yet (I'm assuming she remembered it, told the kitchen to make it, but never put it on the check), took our check back, and added it. Oh and they took our entrees to the wrong table too. The food is good but under-staffing on a popular night is a no-go for me."}
{"text":"Great, authentic food.  Worth the drive.  Try the carne asada and carnitas.  Among the best I've ever had outside Mexico."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I use to go to another Mexican Restaurant in the plaza midwood area and it was the only place I went for almost a year. Well the service started getting slack and the food fell off a little bit. My fianc√© and I decided to try La Unica and it was just ok the first couple  times but good enough for us to keep trying. And I am so glad we did keep coming back because it seems like they've done a complete 360. The food has always been on point but now the service is great too. I work in the industry and service is a make it or break it for me. You can have the best food in town but if you can't it right or hot or in a timely manner then I'll go find someone who will get me mediocre food like I want it. I feel like we literally see every server in the restaurant; whether it's bringing out chips or bringing our drinks or taking our order. That's what I call awesome; every server in the place should be just as focused on the other servers tables as they are on theirs to ensure everyone is always taken care of. I truly appreciate a Mexican restaurant with food that's always right, hot and timely and service that is quick, efficient and attentive. It's hard to find!"}
{"text":"Lunch break...time is always of the essence...quick service ordered a speedy Gonzalez...tasted great and never had to ask for a refill. Consistency with flavor and is a big deal with me and the chips weren't stale which happens alot.   Definitely repeat"}
{"text":"We have been loyal customers of La Unica but over the last few months service has really started to lack. After tonight, we likely won't be back.  We were sat at the same time as a large party. The server was slow to bring drinks, but we were patient. After that, she took another table's (seated after us) drink and food order and the large party - never returning to us. We sat for 25+ minutes with menus on our table and absolutely no service.  We are incredibly patient customers, but tonight was completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around east Charlotte. Very fast service and the food is excellent. Pork Caritas is to die for. Also try their authentic style tacos. Don't forget a large Horchata to wash it down!"}
{"text":"Great service. Awesome tacos from the authentic tacos- be brave you're missing out on good food if you just get the regular tacos! Love the menudo soup! Huge portions!"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and the food comes out quick. Their asado tacos are OKAY. A bit on the dry side and lacking flavor."}
{"text":"Best mexican food around here. I have been to both places Huntersville and Harrisburg"}
{"text":"I went to La Unica last night for the first time. I thought the food was pretty good.  As someone else mentioned they serve 2 types of salsa with chips, after chatting with the bartender a little, he brought us two additional salsa's to try, both had more way more spice than the first ones. The chips were hot and fresh and all 4 salsa's were very tasty.   The steak fajitas were very good, meat was tender and well seasoned, the vegetables were very fresh.  My boyfriend had a sampler of the tacos and all were really good.   Margaritas were awesome! Not too sweet - i hate that! Staff was incredibly friendly and fun.    Dinner bill was under $40... overall its a pretty decent local mexican restaurant in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Tuesdays- can't go wrong. $1 authentic (onion + cilantro) tacos, plus free chips and salsa! There are about 8 different tacos to pick from, but I always go for the chicken and veggie tacos - they never disappoint.   However, this place is hit or miss on Tuesday- you either get seated right away or will have to wait 15/20 minutes. Service too, but I've had more better experiences with service than worse.  PRO TIP- Ask for the green salsa with your chips. It's free, but you must ask. It's a mix of guac, lime and jalape√±o. Great on it's own, or on your tacos. YUMMY!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant in the area. It's authentic. The service is awesome. Drink specials are great. Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"La Unica fits the bill for fast, easy and delicious mexican food.  There's nothing fancy about this place - just consistently good food and service.    When the weather is nice, I like to sit on the patio and enjoy a few drinks, chips and fajitas."}
{"text":"We love this place and went frequently before they moved.  Visited the new location this past Friday night and we hope this will not be the norm.  Our service was very slow.  My food order came out wrong.  I ended up with two cheese enchiladas......one the cheese was so melted you couldn't tell if it really had anything in it and the other the cheese was cold.  The server never refilled our water till just before we were leaving.  We will go back but are hoping they get it together and not be overwhelmed with the new bigger location."}
{"text":"The food was great - not the usual order by number Mexican food. But, we were celebrating a birthday so Margaritas were key - the Margaritas here were the worst I have ever had. They tasted like they had no tequila in them. After we added shots they tasted like tequila and water - the mix they use must be very low rate. Bottom line, come for the food and drink somewhere else."}
{"text":"La Unica. The restaurant here has stayed in business for quite a long time considering the location. Many Huntersville residents may recall the dancing dragon guy on the corner promoting the old Chinese chop suey restaurant and then the prior Mexican restaurant about three years ago.  It was good seeing the high ranking reviews of this little restaurant. They were making it and they seemed to be sticking around for a long time. I've made several lunch breaks here with coworkers and friends and after seeing the 4-5 stars, I needed to write my review.   The reviews of this place seem so fanatical and raving that it would seem as if their taco shells were made of gold. My review may come as a surprise to many. Let me start with their service; excellent and speedy. There's nothing wrong with their service and they will seat you as soon as a table is open or accommodate a table to fit that extra person. Now to the food.   Everyone I know usually comes here for their lunch specials which are a good deal. Although, there are many other restaurants that serve more and the same quality for the buck; $6.95 is the usual price for their combo meals and drinks will bring that up to $9 almost. A little high for their lunch portions compared to the other competition around the area. One of the things I wished they did here though was put their authentic tacos in a combination style dish on their menu. They offer each one by taco, which may make some leery as they don't think they are getting a deal compared to their Tex-Mex combinations for lunch.   What really drew me in to La Unica was the user photo of their tacos carne asada. I had a fortunate opportunity to eat an authentic tacos carne asada at my friend's place. His grandfather used to sell these delicious tacos out a stand to the local workers back home. Once again, I was expecting the best according to all these reviews. I was highly disappointed. Asar in spanish means to roast; in this case, mesquite, flame roasted. The meat lacked that very basic flavor. Seasoning wasn't there either; no hint of rock salt or lime. It was skillet or bistec cooked. There's a difference that everyone should taste before calling me snobby.   The corn tortillas and garnishes were right on par with what I was expecting though. Then that was it. No guacamole on the side, salsa, or lime wedges. I had to ask for the limes, which brought a smile to the waiter and gladly brought out a handful. After finishing my meal, I was thoroughly disappointed.   I thought that Huntersville had the hidden gem of Charlotte. A place that made an hour drive worth it. That's just not here.  *I'll try the Indian location sometime."}
{"text":"I've only tried the tacos so far and they are really good. It's a real authentic Mexican restaurant. Coming from Southern California it's hard to find good authentic food."}
{"text":"This simple little hole in the wall/strip center restaurant is excellent.   Quick service, hot chips and cold salsa, delicious guacamole (stopped in the other night and got some to go for our meal at home!), friendly staff - they've got it all. The \"street tacos\" are delicious - meat, 2 flour tortillas, onion, cilantro & limes on the side. Something as simple as a chicken quesadilla is so good. This place is the best around!  How can you go wrong with a picture of the owner & Rusty Wallace behind the register!?!"}
{"text":"I called to place an order. The lady who answered the phone was very rude and kept putting me on hold , not completing my order. I came in person to place my order and the server was extremely rude.  The food is good here. Unfortunately the service is not"}
{"text":"Love everything about this restaurant. Staff is friendly, prices are even friendlier. The food is sooo bomb, best Mexican I've had in a while. I ordered off the vegetarian menu and it was super filling!  The wait for a table was under a minute and waiting for the food was under 5 minutes!  My go to Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"The customer service was terrible and the food made my friend sick. We waited for our drinks for 30 minutes and then didn't get our food for an hour. The food was nothing special and my friend threw up the tacos she ate later that night. I will never go again."}
{"text":"Good local restaurant with friendly staff,  good food and pretty fast service.  Daily food and drink specials.  I had the combination plate with enchilada and tamale while hubby had the combo burrito with enchilada.  Overall we were happy."}
{"text":"Nice small restaurant.  Perfect vegetarian food.  Customer service was Ok but not bad."}
{"text":"Some of the best salsa verde I have ever tasted.  The food was amazing.  The rice and beans light and tasty. Service was super.  They care about their food and their customers."}
{"text":"We'd heard good things about La Unica but were pretty happy with our regular Mexican restaurant. They recently moved to a new, larger location and we happened to be driving by the day they opened. We decided to go ahead and give it a try. We got really lucky and beat the rush. About 10 minutes after we got there it was standing room only with people streaming in. It must have been a 90 minute wait when we left!!  It didn't take long to figure out why the crowd was so large. First, the salsa they bring out with the chips was fantastic. It actually had a little kick to it. The food was really good as well. I had 3 tacos a la cart - asada, al carbon, and carnitas. They were authentic street tacos with plenty of meat. Best I've had on this coast for sure. My wife had a combination plate with a chicken taco. The chicken was excellent, moist and season just right. Very tasty. The rice was very good as well.  Service was a little slow, but not annoyingly so, especially considering how packed the place was. The prices were competitive, probably a bit lower than the other Mexican sit downs in the area. Overall, it was a very good experience. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried La Unica last night and was pretty impressed.  We were greeted and seated quickly and within minutes had ice cold beers with iced glasses to boot.  As mentioned, they offer a couple of salsas.  Keying on Joseph's suggestion, we asked for guacamole which was excellent.. some of the freshest I have had in Charlotte. The food was delivered quickly and was perfect.  The portions are large and everything was very fresh.  Our large entrees were both under $10.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"My friend took me here last night because he was in the mood for tacos. I was hesitant since I can be pretty picky, but I carried on. I ordered the asada, barbacoa, and lengua tacos. All the meat in the tacos were lacking flavor, very bland. It was served on flour tortillas, when we specifically asked for corn.  The barbacoa taco was soak and continued to drop fatty oils until a bowl of soup appeared. The best part of the taco was the cheese they used, it was delicious! The service was good and the atmosphere was good; I don't think I will be returning though."}
{"text":"Great little place if you're in a pinch for some quick Mexican food. I've only done lunch with this establishment, but I'm sure it would be just fine for dinner too. There are many good deals on the menu so its not gonna break the bank at all. I was skeptical at first only because the previous restaurant never looked busy and obviously closed down; I always get skeptical with that sort of situation, but glad I stepped up and tried it out; now our whole office try's to order once a month from there!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service. However, the decor and seating arrangement leaves much to be desired.  Perfect in and out place for lunch. Be careful with the chips and salsa...they are pretty good and it's hard to stop!  If you like spicy then ask for their 'green' hot sauce."}
{"text":"Much prefer Three Amigos down the street. Both orders were incorrectly prepared and communication from the staff was near nonexistent. Even though we live 2 miles away, we probably won't return."}
{"text":"Perfect for families with small kids like us. We were seated right away on the patio in a booth. Our waitress was polite and fast. The food was definitely the best part. 2 kinds of salsa - one mild, one spicy. Very authentic, fresh ingredients and good portions. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"It was extremely busy, yet we were seated quickly and the food was delicious!  I ordered the Supreme Enchilidas that were cooked to perfection and served with tasty rice, spicy salsa, and fresh sour cream.  Would definitely go back again.  In fact, I went back the next day for lunch.  Highly recommended :)  The only downside was that the parking lot was very full, but the food was worth it."}
{"text":"My go-to Mexican restaurant. Ask for the green salsa if you like it hot!  Friendly staff, quality consistent food."}
{"text":"Try the cheesesteak burrito. The service is always good. Awesome neighborhood Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Thumbs up! The food was great, the service was amazing and the food came in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic Mexican food! Great atmosphere-- very family friendly. Very clean interiors. Friendly, efficient staff. Great prices! A great place to enjoy wonderful food!"}
{"text":"There is not much to say....Unbelievable. True Mexican food! No speedy gonzales here! My husband and I drive and hour just to eat here!"}
{"text":"Despite being located in between a used book store and food lion, La Unica is a jewel. Friendly and fast service.  They have great tacos (pastor, asada, and carnitas) which are the only item I ever order.  Also, they have great horchata.  My husband and I love this place and we frequent the restaurant often."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 0 stars. We arrived at 6:30 on a Friday night, waited 25 minutes before our food order was taken, and another hour and 20 minutes to get our food. There were empty booths all around, so the kitchen wasn't slammed. It's typical mexican food, should be quick and easy. We had to flag down random waiters for more drinks, more chips & salsa, etc. It was just absolutely terrible service. After speaking with the manager, he did nothing to resolve the situation. Definitely won't be going back or recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been out here in NC for about 6 years and haven't found a great Mexican restaurant as delicious as this! By far this is as good as it's going to get compared to back home in California. Being Mexican myself I know what Mexican food is supposed to taste like and most restaurants are not authentic. I love their tacos! I was glad they had a drink called Horchata (cinnamon rice milk) just as good as my grandmother and mom made! My family and I will definitely be regular customers! Can't wait till our next visit!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to go for taco Tuesday's! The staff are very friendly here, great for group events, fast service, $1 tacos on Tuesdays & unlimited Nachos."}
{"text":"We love La Unica and are so happy to see there is now one in Huntersville! It's the perfect place for a GREAT meal for CHEAP. The tacos are by far my favorite but everything else is great too... including the margarita!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican, in a very unassuming strip mall.  Have eaten here multiple times while working in the area, always solid food,  hot and fresh.   They give you 2 types of salsa with the chips. One is very good, with yucca and just the right amount of smoky heat and lime, love it!  The chicken soup lunch is great, comes with cheese quesadilla, and a massive bowl of homemade Mexican style chicken soup. The soup has large chunks of fresh avocado, it is great!  I will def stop in next time I am in the area for lunch!"}
{"text":"When I first moved to the Huntersville area I really liked this place. However I feel it is not as good as it once was. I once gave it five stars but now I have to give it three. The food quality is just not what it used to be. The portion sizes have gone down as well as the quality of service. Its not one of my go to places anymore."}
{"text":"We went to this place recently. We order promptly, as the place wasn't that busy. After waiting a while, the food finally showed up. , and I ordered a chicken dish that barely, and I mean barely had any chicken. For $10 bucks?? No... I made my concern known, and they took a whole Whopping dollar off. Really?? Don't insult me like that. And got rude on top of that. FY!  Do yourself the favor and bypass this place. Mexicasa is a much, much better place for Mexican food in Harrisburg!!"}
{"text":"I have been to La Unica quite a few times now, and I'm a big Mexican food lover!  As I have said before, I could eat chips and salsa daily, and sometimes I do unfortunately haha!  Anyways, I would have to say that this restaurant is super consistent, which is really important!  I have had their guacamole (it's OK, not very flavorful), cheese dip (pretty good), tacos and fajitas (both good).  They have a nice patio, which we usually utilize when visiting.  Good drink specials too...usually big Dos Equis Amber for $4.25, which is reasonable.  Their margaritas are decent, not super strong but not weak either with good flavor.  If you are in Harrisburg, head here for some good Mexican!"}
{"text":"I cannot tell you how good La Unica is....you have to go and see for yourself!  It is seriously the best mexican food that I have ever eaten - even as good or better than when traveling to Mexico.     Fast, friendly service, home made chips and salsa!  The authenic tacos are not to be missed!  Really anything you try will be good--just go!!!h"}
{"text":"When you step into this small location in a strip mall you are transferred to Mexico the sights the sounds the tastes. Food made as if it came from a Mexican families kitchen and a great selection of that and the spirits . To start they bring out not one not two but, 3 different salsas some hot some not my favorite is the Guacamole it has the richness of the avocado and heat . Service was excellent I was visited every two or 3 minutes from 3 different servers then the \"Head \" server came and asked \"if the food was to my liking\" as if I was the only one in place. Saw alot of locals which is always a good sign!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has bad reviews. My husband and I thought it was good for Mexican food. I had Steak and chicken fajitas and he had the chicken enchiladas with red sauce.  Steak was good and not chewy/fatty (typical for most places like this). Chicken was cooked perfectly and the tortillas were really good too. Enchiladas were great, simple red sauce with cheese and not greasy. We both had Jalape√±o Margaritas, which were a complete win. Overall, we liked it for a night where cooking was not an option."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous.  Don't underestimate it it because it's next to a Food Lion, Dairy Queen, Bojangles and a Subway.  This place is fantastic and so inexpensive.   Coming from California, we've been disappointed with many \"Mexican\" places here in the Lake Norman area, but La Unica is the best we've found in the Metro Charlotte area.  Even better, it's affordable and they have great specials every night on either food or drinks.  The chips and salsa are fresh and tasty, the queso is to die for, the guac is killer and don't even get me started on the shredded beef tacos (no yellow cheddar here... freshly shredded queso and fresh-made crispy shells... yum!).  Highly recommend the Flautas dinner, the chimichangas, the burrito combos and my husband raves about the carnitas.  Well done, La Unica!"}
{"text":"If you like good authentic Mexican food, this is the place! Great service too! They also make a great jalape√±o margarita, which I love!"}
{"text":"Nice and friendly staff. Great place for some good tacos."}
{"text":"Oh where do I start? First, I want to say the food was actually really good. I had the super chimichangas and we shared some nachos. Salsa was nice and spicy. My lovely meal was spoiled by a crappy manager and sub par service.  My nephew wanted a salad with bacon and cheese, that's it. We receive a full taco salad instead.  We send it back to get our correct item. They bring out the salad again and it's still wrong!! My nephew decides to eat it because he's starving. When we get the bill, I'm being charged damn near $8!! When I ask for the manager, he never comes to the table and he refuses to change the amount. As a matter of fact, he tells my server he's not going to change it and I don't have to pay for my food!! It's mind boggling!! I sat there for at least 30 minutes waiting for this damn manager! He never shows up and then relays an idiotic statement!! Order takeout; don't dine in!"}
{"text":"The word that was in my head was \"meh\" and that's the description of a two star.  Nothing was bad but nothing to write home about.  The servers were attentive and friendly, but they didn't really change anything from the previous Mexican restaurant.  I got my standard Chile Relleno and something fried.  Both were OK, but kind of bland.  Really just kind of a non-event.  Don't know that we'll be back with much better Mexican options nearby on Central."}
{"text":"We have been going to this restaurant for about 5 years. The food was always good and servers were nice. We have slowly noticed in the past couple of years that the quality service has deteriorated. They rush you to order immediately then get irritated and don't come back for 15 mins if your not ready. You can actually feel the negative vibes and stares from some of the servers and its annoying. Last several times timing on delivering checks way off. As far as the food, it's you basic mexican, factory food. We usually get a side of avocado and they used to be fresh but now they always have brown spots. I always wake up feeling absolutely horrible the next day. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced. I had to ask for my check before the food came out that I asked to have boxed up to eat at home. Server walked up after we walked to the bar to get drinks after waiting for 15 minutes to be greeted. I know it was cinco de mayo, however this is the third time I have been here and it is never \"decent\" service. I will never come again and I would not recommend anyone coming."}
{"text":"The service was fast.   Maybe I just don't know what to get but the enchiladas were ok.  Very bland. My husbands food was ok.  So this being the second time I've been here I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place is a total shit show. They're more concerned with asking \"is everything okay?\" repeatedly rather than actually addressing issues. If you're eating here, go ahead and plan on having to ask 4 different people for the same thing before its brought to you."}
{"text":"I got the #1 combination for lunch with one taco, two enchiladas, rice and beans! The most delicious enchiladas I've had in Charlotte! Rice and beans were yummy too! Loved my house margarita! Service was incredible ... Very sweet and always checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed!"}
{"text":"Service and food was great! The tacos are authentic. The salsa was YUMM! The tostada De cevich was the best I have ever tasted. I would come back over and over again just for the ceviche. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food was good, I ordered arroz con camarones. It came out very quickly, and more than I could eat. I also had a coronarita, it was quite large but delicious. What made my visit more pleasant was our waitress, Crystal. I am a sucker for good service, and she did fantastic.  The restaurant was pretty busy, but she was quick and attentive, and had such a fantastic attitude. She smiled every time she came to the table and did not rush off, no matter how busy it was.   Also, one of the other ladies that served us the salsa, (didn't catch her name) was very nice and friendly, and even made sure to thank us when we were leaving.   Will be back for this reason only! Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"Consistently solid, approximately authentic Mexican. 3.5/4 stars anywhere else in the civilized world but 5 stars in the food desert known as Harrisburg."}
{"text":"Great food for the money.  I love the burrito California. Great spot for a quick and authentic meal."}
{"text":"Been dining here for a year now. It's one of my daughter's and my favorite spots. The service is always quick and attentive and the food is very good. I usually get the Enchiladas Verde (Chicken Enchiladas with tomatillo sauce), it's my regular dish to order at most Mexican places. Hands down, La Unica's beats the competition- all white meat chicken, covered but not drowning in sauce. The salsas are great, especially if you like spicy, and this is the perfect place if you're in a rush- you can usually get out within 25-30 minutes. My only complaint is that parking can be a little cumbersome. Overall, it's the spot to go for Mexican in Harrisburg!"}
{"text":"This was our first trip to this well reviewed strip mall eatery. Location aside, this isn't a bad little mexican joint. Little is a key word. Stuffy is another. Perhaps on a less crowded day (not a Sunday lunch) the environment will be more comfortable.   Heat aside, the service was quite good and the manager was very friendly. We were given good chips & two salsas and our drink orders immediately taken upon being seated. The mild salsa is fresh and light. The spicy has a good kick to it. I no longer enjoy spicy (big shout out to pregnancy heartburn!) but I did taste it and while the heat gets your attn, it isn't obnoxious and doesn't take up residence on your tastebuds. The guacamole was very underwhelming. No tomatoes, red onions or chiles - it was more like avocado/cilantro dip.   I ordered the chicken chimichanga & suspect I should've trusted my gut and ordered the enchiladas verde. The chicken was plentiful & flavorful but that's all there was. No bell peppers or onions. :(   Hubby enjoyed the ala cart tacos and I was impressed w/the variety offered (inc beef tongue). They don't offer black beans so I suspect the vegetarian offerings are simply meatless as refried beans are traditionally made w/lard.   My 3yo son loved his beans and rice. I was pleasantly surprised to see his burrito prepared enchilada style. He ate half of his burrito and my husband promptly Bogarted the rest.   I wasn't over-the moon impressed but the traditional offerings of hotchata, aqua fresca, chilequilles and menudo make me think this place has something real to offer, so we will gladly return for another try."}
{"text":"Easily the best Mexican restaurant in the area. The hot salsa is excellent. I usually go with the tacos, but everything else I have tried has been great as well. Quick service and extremely cheap!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Charlotte! The menu offers a lot of different options that you can't usually find. The burritos and tacos are my favorites. The margarita here are great too, and the staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"I have to say, after another visit here...this continues to be the best mexican in the entire area.....basic, good, inexpensive and ICE COLD beer MUGS!!!!"}
{"text":"Good fajitas Great service No cheese spillage on my denim shorts  Best Mexican joint in Harrisburg"}
{"text":"My partner and I just moved to Charlotte so we are on the hunt for yummy new spots and we wanted to find a delicious Mexican place to possibly frequent in the future.   So awesome! great food, fast service, reasonably priced, and great staff!"}
{"text":"Honestly I was scared to try it at first because the outside looks really sketchy. We walked in and say down and they brought the chips and salsa. Which the salsa was amazing! Me and my husband have deemed this our new favorite restaurant. Everytime we have date night we go here. Amazing food and service!"}
{"text":"This is \"THE best\" salsa in Charlotte. Inexpensive and quick service too."}
{"text":"Here is what you need to order: a California burrito with Carnitas. It is not on the menu, but boy is it good and I've never had a waiter complain about the change.  That is the best dish that you can get there, in my opinion of course!"}
{"text":"I took my GF here for her bday at her request. We where both rather disappointed. We sat on the patio and noticed how loud it was. Both from road noise and from the music. Our meals did not come with sides, our son's meal was not what he requested. The prices are low, so if you want a cheap meal this is an option. The food was ok, but nothing special I think we could have done better at home. I don't plan to go back."}
{"text":"Don't fall for the hype.  It's nothing special.   Below average chips and salsa. Unfriendly wait staff. Food came out quickly. I had the steak fajitas.  The fajitas were just ok. The flavors are plain and the place is about what you expect from a generic Mexican place in a strip mall. Not going to be back."}
{"text":"Reminds me of Texas Mexican food. The chorizo is amazing and the service is quick. Order the queso along with a corona when you sit down and take advantage of Taco Tuesday ($1 tacos). You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Always looking for a good Mexican place as it is my favorite thing to eat! Decided to give this place a try and I'm glad I did! We got seated right away on a Saturday night! Most of the burritos come with nacho cheese on them but I asked to get quest instead since I like it more. It was not a problem! Our waitress was very nice and attentive and food was delicious! Great and similar to any other Mexican restaurant! Only thing I wasn't fond of was my margarita. I usually like the frozen lime ones that most have but this was made in a blender and one of those ice at top liquid at bottom type of frozen margarita. Would get it on ice next time to solve this problem because other than that it was fantastic! Also has a large parking lot in the back so no worries about finding a spot!"}
{"text":"This was probably the absolute worst service experience I have ever witnessed! I work in the service industry and am a forgiving person that's gets you may be busy or having an off day but my experience tonight was so bad all we could do was laugh.  If I could give multiple ratings I'd give the food a 3, it was actually pretty tasty.  The drinks, a 2, for an authentic restaurant the obvious lack of fresh juices in a margarita is a bit beneath you, yea?  Service a ZERO! We sat and weren't greeted for about 5 minutes, that's forgivable. The server then took our drink orders and appetizers. We then sat without drinks, alcohol and water included, for at least 15 minutes. No exaggeration required. Our food was then brought out, nothing of which we had ordered, so the food runner went back to the kitchen and minutes later our server brought the correct dishes. After the drop she NEVER came back. Literally. NEVER. My boyfriend, beer empty, finally went to the bar to get another round. About 10 to 15 minutes later, meal finished, still no sign of her. What appeared to be a manager came by and picked up a plate. We asked for our check, he said ok he'd be right back. That NEVER happened.... About 10 minutes later I finally went to the bar and asked the bartender for our check. He went looking for the waitress and he couldn't even find her... He finally came and sat down at the table and wrote down what we had ordered then re rang it under his name at the bar.   What makes this story even crazier, I ran into a friend on the way out and before I could even speak he said that was the absolute worst dining experience he'd ever had. Not sure if we had the same waitress...  We will not be back."}
{"text":"El restaurante tiene  buena comida pero es inconsistente en las porciones y servicio. Era una cliente semanal al menos una o dos veces. Pero despu√©s de ser ignorada mientras dos parejas q sentaron despu√©s de mi, fueran atendidas con  bebidas, salsas y chips es imposible  q no nos vieran. nos ignoraron totalmente a tal punto q nos levantamos y salimos sin nadie q se nos acercar√° a preguntar q pasaba. No vuelvo a ir y tampoco lo recomiendo."}
{"text":"Terrible! I'm visiting the area from out of state. So I consulted yelp for good local food. Based on the 52 reviews I decided to eat here. I don't understand how this place got 4 1/2 stars. First, they are way WAY overpriced. Second, the service was awful. No refills were offered. No sight of the server after our food was delivered. No lemon existed in the restaurant even though a grocery store is in the same strip mall. No thousand island dressing which was offered on the menu. Bottom line the quality of the food was not worth $80 for 4 adults."}
{"text":"Best cinco de mayo  in la unica . It was very busy it was there first cinco de mayo .All the servers were very nice they were running trying to take care of everyone .i am sure next year they will have more servers.But we had a great time.The band was awesome and the margaritas were the best i have has.Thanks la √∫nica for a crear day."}
{"text":"Really good food! Fast and friendly service. Menu was pretty big with lots of options. Chips and salsa were good and I had a chimichanga which was excellent! Plaza Midwood is a favorite area for us and this is on our top 5 list."}
{"text":"I would choose this over any other mexican place in Charlotte. Perfect on every level. Their free salsa is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"The smallest lunch chimichanga portion I've ever come across in my life. The price was in-line with other places but the size was ridiculous.  I actually ate more chips at the end just to fill up.  My chimi was understuffed, came with almost no toppings except the bottom quarter-sized tomato slice that most people throw out, a laughable amount of beans, and some  lettuce shreds on the side that had a distinct chemical-flavor ...maybe cleaning solution from a counter? and no rice.   My co-workers Lunch-sized Quesadilla did come with rice...and was a normal portion-size. I was just the lucky one who ordered poorly.  Service was very quiet. We did receive our meals quickly however there wasn't a whole lot of follow up on how anything was.  I did like the salsa and I thought the place itself seemed clean/comfortable."}
{"text":"Had a early dinner with my daughters, and the food and service were perfect for a Mexican restaurant. A great addition to the neighborhood, and should thrive.. Great price point, and very clean dinning area.."}
{"text":"I hate to give a one star review. The servers were very nice; unfortunately they were very inattentive. They got an order wrong and barely checked on us; I was parched all through our Wednesday night dinner. I got the arroz con pollo, and it was more than disappointing. After searching for the chicken and rice in my meal, I was left with an actual half a plate of just onion. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I am happy to have found this place. It seems there are very few Mexican restaurants close to Uptown that aren't like gourmet taco shops or upscale Mexican food or something else different. Sometimes you just need the classic unlimited chips and salsa place. Speaking of which, they bring you out hot and mild salsa with your chips.  They have a nice covered patio area in the back. Thats where I always sit. Our server most recently was great! She was really on top of things.  They have great lunch specials and if you want one of the lunch specials on a weekend it is only $1extra. Lunch fajitas for the win. My only complaint is that the guacamole is almost flavorless, had to add my own salt and lime."}
{"text":"Hands down. The best Mexican food I've had! I went here only because of Yelp. If you're a fajita fan do the lunch portion. It's a ton of food and during dinner it's only a dollar more ;-)"}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots in the area.  La Unica has the friendliest staff, fastest service and has good food as well.  If the weather is decent, sit on the patio so you can say hey to your friends who are wandering around (it's one of the perks of living in Harrisburg, we know each other!).  Their margaritas are as big as your head-so perfect for the splitting with someone.    Our kids don't believe a meal is complete without the queso and chips-because as you know, dairy products are good for bone density. Kids either get quesadilla or enchiladas, I can't get away from the arroz con pollo because it's so perfect, and DH tries to switch it up!  We've never had a bad meal here!  Expect a wait if you arrive after 6p or so. The full bar area is separate from the restaurant and usually has a stack of boxes but don't let that detract from the place-it's all good."}
{"text":"I have been to a few locations of La Unica and some are better than others. This location is very convenient for me. The great thing about eating here is that you will be seated right away and your food comes out within 10 minutes of ordering. They have two different types of salsa. A very mild and a quite spicy. I like to mix both to create the perfect combination. Their queso is fantastic and my husband usually just gets that as his meal. They have drink specials every day but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with this location. By far it is the best! It has the typical Mexican restaurant decor and ambience. The guacamole and two different salsas were great in addition to the tortilla chips. The lunch menu was very cheap and I would suggest going for lunch for a great deal and the portions were not smaller they were quite large! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the service is not as friendly as the Indian trail location. If you are in the area, I would highly recommended this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, standard Mexican food. Nothing mind blowing although the past 2 times we've been have both been disappointing. My boyfriend ordered the ACP which was mushy and my torta was practically all bread which was stale. The server also brought out fries which are optional with the tortas except I didn't order them but was still charged. The margaritas have also been watery the past few times we've gotten them."}
{"text":"No frills here, just some cheap Mexican food that hits the spot. This place is 5 minutes from my house, so it often wins during my hungover, queso craving recovery days.   They bring you both a mild and spicy salsa with your chips. Pro tip: ask for the green salsa as well. Spicy and delicious. When asking for queso, make sure to specify dip or else you'll end up with a side of shredded cheese.   Tuesdays can get pretty busy here for dollar authentic tacos. I like that they have a long list of options for this (chicken, steak, chorizo, veggies, beef tongue, shredded beef, chunky or roast pork). Most places skimp on $1 nights and only give you a couple choices. Aside from dollar taco night, the entire menu (especially for lunch) is pretty cheap.   Nice covered patio. The bathrooms are located in the space between La Unica and Kickstand. The parking lot is kind of rough, so make sure to just pay attention and drive carefully."}
{"text":"The area is shady because it is next to the old food lion and an empty run down building, but it is seriously the best mexican food I have ever had. I can't believe I haven't eaten here in a few months. That needs to change soon!"}
{"text":"This restaurant replaced Loco Lime....but dont go in expecting to compare the two because they are not nearly the same.  Not that one is better or one is worse.    Went on a Monday night....very few diners present.  The decor has changed some.  Its casual and comfortable....but the lighting is a bit bright.  Tolerable, but bright.  They serve 2 types of salsa with their chips.  I liked the spicy one best.  It was quite tasty.  The chips weren't bad....but they weren't hot and fresh like at some other places.  My friend had the Nachos.  They looked pretty good and he had no trouble polishing off his plate.  I had the Shrimp Diabla.  It was Shrimp, Onions and mushrooms (which i added) in a spicy red sauce.  I couldnt believe how many shrimp they have me in this dish.  For $11....they had to lose $.   Either that or ive been getting ripped off at every other restaurant i eat shrimp at.  Anyway, it was loaded with shrimp.  The res saice was really really spicy....but not over done.  I really enjoyed my dish.    Be very clear when you decide to do separate checks.  Otherwise, they will split the bill down the middle and run your card.  When we tried to have them correct it, it was explained to us that it would take a few days for the bank to adjust it on our accounts.  My friend got pissed over this, so i doubt we will be back...due to that fact only.  I liked the food....i would dine there again.  Not quite sure why other Yelpers have been giving it such bad press."}
{"text":"La Unica has authentic mexican cuisine. Their food is prepared fast and the quality of food is great. I love the different salsas that they bring with chips to the table. Homemade and fresh (one of which is spicy) . Their margaritas are huge and priced good. They also have homemade fruit juices as well. The cantaloupe juice is really refreshing. I haven't had anything on their menu that I wasnt satisfied with."}
{"text":"Excellent dollar tacos on Tuesday, el pastor was the best of what we tried then the chicken. One of the Salas's was full of onions and extra spicy, unsure why it was like that, but we liked it. Looks pretty nice inside and the staff and service was great"}
{"text":"LOVE this place and apparently so does everyone else in Harrisburg! Every time I drive by there is a line of people out the door! My husband (Jordan) and I made our first trip here a little over a week ago and he has been back since without me (he is not even a fan of mexican food!).  To start your meal you have the standard chips and salsa one spicey and the other not so much. Jordan liked the spicey one so much he asked if we could buy some -- and yes they do sell it!  I had a number one which is a taco, two enchiladas, rice or beans.  DELISH! I wasn't super crazy about the beans though they were extremely runny.  Jordan had the three tacos dish one with chorizo, pulled beef, and chicken -- he said the chorizo was the best.  Atmosphere it's pretty much the normal mexican restaurant, the staff is friendly, and overall its clean."}
{"text":"I always have a great experience at La Unica!   We recently went for a family birthday celebration with 11 adults and three children.  The service was fantastic. The hostess and waiters were kind and helpful. They quickly put together tables for us and seated us quickly. I ordered two of the street tacos (carnitas and chicken). They weren't the best tacos I've ever had, but they were good, especially for the price! The friendly atmosphere and great service is definitely reason enough for me to return."}
{"text":"Unica is our favorite authentic Mexican restaurant in Lake Norman.  Their food is fantastic, and they have a wide variety of options on their menu (including breakfast).  Their carnitas pork is always succulent and delicious, and you absolutely have to try their authentic tacos, Unica-style.  They are a great bargain and taste unbelievably good!   Service is friendly, attentive, and fast (even when there are big crowds).  It's a great place for a quick bite to satisfy your Mexican food craving!"}
{"text":"Was not satisfied with my food yesterday. Found a piece of eyelash hair in my chicken taco... And my boyfriend told me to be quiet about it, or else I would have raised hell. Definitely wasn't happy about it. So I just hurried up and downed my strawberry margarita. Never again will I come here. Big nope."}
{"text":"No real surprises. The food is good. The service is good and the prices are reasonable. They have a nice place to sit outdoors when the weather is good. They also have daily food and drink specials."}
{"text":"I came on a Saturday night and had no wait to be seated, or for food which was nice.  They had a margarita pitcher on special for $16.  It tasted petty good, a little sour, but not bad.  The chips and salsa were fresh and spicy.  I prefer the most spicy and chunky one.  I ordered a hard and soft beef taco.  I preferred the soft.  The beef was a little on the greasy side, but overall ok.  The service was excellent and the atmosphere was nice.  NOTE: do not try to enter at the the front of the building!! *Entrance in rear* :)"}
{"text":"Had lunch at this place a couple days ago. I ordered the arroz con pollo. It was good, but nothing to jump up and down about. I would say it was like any other you'd order at another restaurant. I will say the portions were huge and I actually took leftovers and ate for dinner. All in all this place was ok."}
{"text":"Coming from the West Coast, I have been dissapointed time and time again with the flavor and overall quality of tacos out here.   La Unica has proved to me that you can always find a gem in the rough! I have not had anything but tacos there and I don't expect to have anything but tacos the next time I visit. Great place, service is quick and polite. Bonus points for giving out a very substantial amount of salsa to go with the chips!   As Arnold once said, 'I'll be back\""}
{"text":"Nice place.  The salsa is hot and mild. I mix them together and they are just right.  Plenty of specials.  Food is always good with good service. Here is a picture of the salsa."}
{"text":"Great food and relaxed atmosphere. Some of the best I have had in Charlotte.  It is high on my list of place to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!  I had 3 of their taco's - all spectacular and loaded with meat.  The Barbacoa (shredded beef) was tender and juicy, the Chorizo (pork sausage) was spicy and full of flavor, and the Carnitas was excellent...think latin pulled pork.  All three were served the traditional style - on doubled up corn tortillas with plenty of onion and cilantro.  For $1.75 each they are a steal.  You can swap out a flour tortilla for $.30 and add lettuce, tomato, cheese, and sour cream for $.30 as well.  My wife had the Pollo (chicken) and Carne Asada (steak) tacos which were excellent as well.  The complimentary chips and salsa were a major highlight.  I preferred in spicier of the two salsa's - smoky and full of flavor.  The mild salsa was a little heavy on the tomato flavor and the spices were fairly understated.    This restaurant is a great addition to the Harrisburg Town Center area.  Affordable dining, in a comfortable atmosphere, with a knowledgable wait staff - hopefully this restaurant is here to stay!"}
{"text":"The margarita tasted like lime juice and sugar. It was terrible. Our server was very nice but seemed to get flustered very quickly when asked any questions. We kept trying to get someone's attention to get our check and when we finally did we had our money out to pay she just dropped the check and didn't come back for ten minutes.  It was about 8:30 on a Tuesday and it didn't seem like they were very busy so I'm not sure why it took so long. The food was pretty good. Aside from the fact one menu item was described as 'spicy' and wasn't even mildly spicy. I know that they are still in their early stages of opening so I may give them another chance in a few months but I won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Just makes me want to say no no no no no La Unica was a big disappointment unfortunately. I was expecting a lot more from their $1 taco Tuesday night. The only thing that was actually decent was the chicken taco with lettuce, tomato and sour cream for a slight up-charge.  The meat was subpar to what I was expecting with flavorless taste. I would not recommend this place to eat on Taco Tuesday or just in general if the quality of the food that I received that night is any indication of what this restaurant has to offer.  I've been to many Mexican restaurants because it's one of my favorite categories of food to eat and this is by far one of the worst. They are the bad generic brand of Mexican food. Pay a little extra for something better.   If you like plain food and bare minimum service than come to this place. The only thing that was better than the chicken taco was the free chips and salsa. It was actually really good.  This place honestly feels like they are a barely making it by and trying to pass off quality food with cheap prices but it doesn't work. You pay for what you get here in terms of quality.   I am not rush to come back but if daring to go give it a try at least get the chips and salsa with drinks."}
{"text":"We had Eli as our server. He was prompt to out orders and made us laugh. All of the staff was smiling too. Food was outstanding especially the margaritas!! Highly recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"A little birdie told me this place had a great taco Tuesday with $1 authentic tacos...of course I was excited and had to visit.   First let me say the entrance to this place is not clear at all. Having parked on the side road next door, I assumed the entrance was in the front. I walked around and straight into their kitchen. Ok note to self not the entrance. The told me the next door over, at this point the only other door I see is for a burger place, confused as all get out, I walk in. Awkward and confused, I think ok maybe it is some weird fusion concept. Finally I am directed through their shared entry way to la unica. I'm sorry, but there is no reason for such confusion with the entry way! Put up a sign or something! I had avoided the parking lot behind the place because of other reviews stating how precarious the driving situation could be back there, so I didn't see the patios til after the fact.   Ordered a frozen margarita and made it a point to ask for it to be less sweet and with salt. Came out tasting like diabetes and with sugar on the rim. To make matters worse, the tacos were atrocious. Ordered two barbacoa, one carnitas, and one lengua. Specifically inquired how the lengua was cut before hand was told it was thinly sliced and of course it came out diced -.-. Barbacoa had no flavor other than oil it definitely needed seasoning. The carnitas was flavourful, but the neat to tortilla ratio was off. Waited almost an hour for our credit card to be returned because they were out of receipt paper? Entered at 6:30 and was waiting to leave til 9:00. Kinda crazy for 4 tacos and a drink!   Overall there are better places in the area with better food. Skip La Unica and head up Central towards Albamarle Rd for authentic tacos at a better price and higher? quality."}
{"text":"Went for taco Tuesday (1$ tacos) and the food was pretty good and came out fast but overall wasn't that special. Service could've been better as well."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice and its always packed and we had to wait both times. Food good, prices low and service friendly. Love the soup and casadia combo. The plates are also a good size. I real find. Its small but I woudl go back again. Drinks are good as well"}
{"text":"The La Unica in Huntersville was a go-to for my husband and me when we lived near the lake! Our first experience was lackluster, but their new, bigger location has a lot more to offer. I always get the guisado (which is, admittedly, a weird thing to continuously order), but it is a LOT of food, and it has a great kick to it! Their margaritas usually had a pretty good kick.   I would advise getting there early or sitting at the bar, because it can get pretty packed on the weekends!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the location of the old Loco Lime.  We decided to give it a try on a Friday night.  The staff couldn't have been any nicer or more welcoming.  In fact, they were nearly tripping all over each other to serve us.  Two women attempted to take our drink and dinner order.  A nice man  came by to ask if everything was good.  We also liked that the restaurant was playing authentic Mexican music in the background.  It doesn't have the same effect when an ethnic establishment plays American pop music.   Tortilla chips and salsa was brought to our table.  We were given two salsas, one which was described as mild and the other labeled hot.  I immediately went fir the hot one and found it to be mildly spicy.  The mild salsa tasted like canned tomato sauce, We both ordered the number two vegetarian.  It came with a bean burrito, chalupa and quesadilla.  The quesadilla was like the best Mexican grilled cheese ever, and I appreciated the crunch and flavor of the chalupa.  The burrito left me flat.  The sauce tasted like an Italian topping, and the cheese was minimal. The prices were great,  it was nice to get two meals and two drinks for under $30.00.  And I definitely will return for more chalupas and quesadillas!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, and cheap. Their hot salsa is actually hot and I love it, chips come out warm. The marinated pork tacos are probably my favorite. Well seasoned and juicy."}
{"text":"My husband and I live around the area, and was a big fan of this company. So far we had gone there and got the tacos with all the sides and usually was great. The past two times we had gone there we found long black hair in our cheese dip. NOT just one visit but TWO visits. Both times we had told our waiter and he just shrugged it off and made it feel like we were trying to get a free meal.  It would have been one thing to see it happen once, and it was an accident, but two times, we are SOoo done with this place. Its a shame, we love spending our money in our local neighborhood, but it makes it tough when this like this become a pattern. Beware of the cheese dip, you might get more protein than you bargained for."}
{"text":"You want a burrito, that's just what you'll get. La Unica is a place where you can count on no-frills, solid food and portions that will blow your mind.   It's a little strange to get into this location. From Central Ave, there isn't really a \"front\". The door which looks like a front door is actually a door that goes to their kitchen. So, you need to enter though Kickstand or the back. There's an awesome outdoor patio and the best part is the mega margs. I was hoping for a jalapeno marg, but it didn't come in the mega size, but our server was great enough to provide me with that one!   If you have a spicey need, you might want to keep going because they didn't have an extra hot sauce or anything beyond Cholula."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Mexican food I've had in Charlotte! Had great speedy service at lunch for a good price   Look forward to visiting the new restaurant when it opens!"}
{"text":"Food is not very good.  I will not be going back.  Best mexican restaurant I have found in Charlotte is Aztecas.  1900 Mexican Grill isn't bad, but Aztecas is by far the best!"}
{"text":"So I decided to check this place out for Taco Tuesday and so glad I did. We went at about 6p and got seated right away but by the time we were leaving it did seem to be a little wait. Upon sitting you get your usually chips and salsa but they give you both a mild & a hot salsa. They have about 8 different $1 authentic tacos that come with cilantro & onions but you can add cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and sour cream for .30 cent more which is still good. I got the barbacoa, chorizo, and asada they were all really good but the barbacoa was hands down my favorite so I ordered two more. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This has become our Wednesday evening treat. The staff is always nice and friendly. The food is great and they have drink specials on Wednesday nights. The chips and salsa are always a great start to our meal also. Awesome place to get a good and reasonable meal."}
{"text":"We came her for lunch today. Based on what I've seen and heard I had some high expectations. They were mostly met and surpassed, though one pretty big aspect of the meal really bombed it for me.  We headed in around 12:00 and were basically ambushed. We were greeted, sat, had our drinks ordered and chips and salsa were on the table within less than one minute. So right off the bat I can say that this is a great place if you're in a rush for lunch! But I wasn't in a rush, so I felt a bit pushed through the meal. The chips were fresh and crisp, and both salsas were pretty good (you get a mild, liquidy salsa and a spicy thick salsa).   The food is very affordable and comes out pretty quickly (a little too quickly for me.) They had a special of the day for $5.00 and majority of the basic combinations on the lunch menu were $5.50. I ordered the #5 combo which consisted of a taco, enchilada and rice. The taco was pretty darn amazing. What really did it for me was the fresh-made shell. This isn't the usual hard shell you find at most places...it's a puffy, crisp holder of goodness. The ground beef (you can also choose chicken) was really flavorful and packed with spices and some kind of pepper (either bell or jalapeno, I couldn't tell since it was chopped pretty fine.) It also came topped with lettuce and some kind of white cheese...I don't know what it was but it wasn't your run of the mill cheddar. The enchilada was also very tasty, and huge! It had the same ground beef as the taco and was covered with a tasty sauce and cheese. The enchilada was cooked perfectly and made for a pretty darn good lunch item. Then came the part of the lunch that was most disappointing...the rice.  I don't want to trash this wonderful restaurant for messing up a single little side item, but when it is a Mexican restaurant with lame rice, then that's just not cool with me. I could actually tell it wasn't going to be good when it came out because it was all kind of mushed together. The rice was definitely waaaaay overcooked and I just detest mushy rice. Not only was it overcooked, but I think the flavor got cooked out of it as well, as it was fairly bland.   The miss' went with the #1 combo which had a taco, chili relleno, guac salad and refried beans. She went with the chicken taco and it was a flavorful, tender shredded bit of meat. The chili relleno was a bit different as it is entirely surrounded by a mass of scrambled egg. The egg was good, and the chili stuffed with chicken and cheese was pretty darn tasty. If anything, the egg made it a bit much in terms of richness but it was a very good chili relleno (sure beat Monterys.) The guac definitely tasted like it was just made and was very refreshing, with a bit more lime bite than usual. The beans were right on par with other beans I've had...pretty great but nothing too fancy or special.  All in all, I enjoyed the meal very much and will most certainly go back. Despite being a tad bit rushed (I'm assuming it was due to the time we went) and the lame rice, it was definitely some top-notch Mexican. And I definitely have to say that they have some of the best tacos I've ever had...those shells and the ground beef crammed in there is the stuff dreams are made of. Actually, I can't wait to go back and give their carnitas a whirl!"}
{"text":"I was very excited about a new place to try on Taco Tuesday.  I found their FB page and a beautiful flyer featuring their 3 options for the $1 Taco Tuesday deal.  At the bottom of the flyer, it lists take out as an option.  This made La Unica my choice for the day over the other taco spot I go to.  Unfortunately, when I arrived, I was told that the tacos were dine-in only.  Since I'd found the flyer on line, I had already made plans to just grab tacos and meet up with someone else after, so we couldn't dine-in this particular day.  That being said, we often do dine-in at places around town, and we love patio seating. We would definitely have come-back to La Unica in the future to sit down and eat, had they handled this differently.   The waitress looked at the flyer I was showing her, and called her manager. The manager agreed that the flyer I was looking at was very confusing as it did list take out on the fire. She went to speak with the owner, and returned briefly after. She agreed that it was a confusing flyer, but restated that the tacos were in fact only dine-in for $1.  I decided to just go back-to my usual taco spot where I can get them take out for $1 only.  This threw a wrench in my plans and set me behind, timewise, for the rest of my night.  I am disappointed in the way that they handled the situation, being in marketing and the service industry, myself. I know it isn't always great to have to discount something, but if they would have handled the situation differently, they could have made a patron for life out of my friends and I."}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this place ever since we found out it would replace Loco Lime (which by the way was pretty decent). We arrived on Monday night and realized we were the only ones in the restaurant (never a good sign). We were greeted and asked immediately if we wanted drinks, so we ordered a Jalape√±o Margarita and a house margarita, which were on special. We were also given some chips and salsa. Let me break down our experience:  Margaritas: The Jalape√±o did not have much kick to it, but it was drinkable. Unfortunately, as mine (house margarita) was being made I noticed that our waitress and another waitress were sampling different combinations and looked very confused about how to mix the ingredients. Needless to say it tasted like coconut water, so they definitely did not get it right.   Food: Chips were extremely greasy, salsa was sub par. We ordered the cheese dip, which was pretty good but again could not take down anymore of the extremely greased-up chips. We ordered the steak quesadilla and no lie, within 2 minutes we received it from the kitchen. I have to say we make better quesadillas at home. The cheese wasn't even melted inside and it was extremely small (was also not cut).  Service- our waitress was really nice, but it was interesting to note that the other waitresses were sitting at the bar, chatting and on their phones.   We will never be back here. Azteca brings much more to the table and it's worth the drive. I hate to be a pessimist, but I can't imagine this place will stay open very long."}
{"text":"My BFF and I have come here multiple times a month for the last several months, admittedly usually on Tuesdays. But even if I celebrate a Taco Tuesday every now and again, I always make sure to add other things to my order, because hogging a table for $4 isn't great. I also tip at least 20%, and if I'm getting tacos, that's based on the original price, not the $1 Tuesday price.  Anyway, on Tuesdays it can be pretty busy, but it's real slow during the week, and that's a shame. I'm always telling people how good it is in the Plaza Midwood Facebook group, but they always want to list other places. IDK man.   They always give us extra chips and salsa too and that's good because we are fatties. I always get some queso. The hot salsa is too hot for me, but I'm a whimp. Even people I know who aren't whimps, like my BFF, need to mix it sometimes. Don't feel bad if you can't do it by itself. Or do, I can't tell you how to live your life.  Also a medium margarita is giant and wonderful.   Today we had Ron and he was super attentive and nice. He kept us all filled up on our food and was always there right before we needed him. He's got a great personality, like most of the wonderful people who work there.   Anyway, go to La Unica."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch here. I ordered the tacos ... shredded beef and roast pork. I liked the roast pork better because it was marinated in a rich, spicy red sauce. The chips come out with two salsas ... mild and spicy. You guessed it, I preferred the spicy.   The menu is impressive. They have a BREAKFAST ALL DAY section, ceviche, vegetarian dinners, and a great selection of mexican desserts."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice in the recent weeks, wife and I have ordered something different each time, no better way to describe their food is OUT OF THIS WORLD. They have great service, chips are brought to the table with 2 salsas, love the hot one, other one is bland. Food is mouth watering, everything hot and tasty. Manager checks on everything, both times he had a waiter cleaning the front window and doors when they weren't busy. Wife said the bathroom was spotless, another good sign, health rating was 98.5. Prices are very reasonable, nothing but good things to say about this place. Makes me hungry thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Went there last week for lunch for the first. I agree with everyone.  Best Mexican Resturant in the area.  The Number 1  lunch combo is awsome"}
{"text":"Looks better from the outside then what is actually inside. My suggestion to the owner is to spend some of the profit from the pricey food to jazz up the interior. Then I wouldn't mind spending the extra money on the atmosphere. The food is really good. Wait staff is friendly and attentive. Cost is above average. It felt like I was sitting in my neighbors kitchen eating authentic cuisine but paying to much for it. Next time I will just get my order to go and eat at home."}
{"text":"Honestly, the service just sucks. It's consistently awful. Food is OK at best. There are much better places to get Mexican food than this here. Seriously don't put yourself through it."}
{"text":"I'm pretty positive that  La Unica has new owners over the past few months. I originally passed over this place a few months back due to the negative yelp reviews. After having a friend mention it, I gave it a try. I mean it's Mexican right by my house with outdoor seating. It doesn't get much better than that.  This place is your standard Mexican it's no Pacos or Cantina, but it's good! If you're looking for a quick and affordable meal give this place a try. Starting out, the salsa is fresh and they give you mild and spicy- can't complain with that. The queso is simple, but does the trick. I've had the tacos- Al pastor, and a few others, always really fresh. More like street tacos. Last week, I split the 'No name' meal and it was enough food for both of us.  The wait staff is speedy and friendly and I've always been able to get a table outside. I'm glad I gave this place a try. Simple Mexican- I'm a fan. I just hope the word doesn't spread too much about this place, but they deserve more business, so I'll do my Yelp duty and give them a deserved review."}
{"text":"So we ordered food from here via a 3rd party delivery service. They delivered our food promptly and within the suggested time. However, they missed some items. So we called the restaurant to let them know of the missing items. The staff member who answered the phone said that they can fix and properly fulfill our order. To do so, we would have to come by the restaurant to pick it up which doesn't make any sense since we ordered for delivery for a reason. In response, the staff member then tried to blame the error of not fulfilling the order on the delivery service. So, instead of trying to fix the problem, the staff member thought it would be better to not fulfill what we ordered and tried the blame game on somebody else. Denying accountability when it is clear that the error lies with you, is not what I would call even decent customer service. We will be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"It's quite exciting when you discover an exceptional restaurant. This place is truly La Unica, The One!  I had the Combo dinner with shrimp and crab meat, it came with a chicken flauta and rice on the side. It was exceptional, excellent and too delicious for words.  It was a great experience, we were seated promptly, it was very busy on the Wednesday after Christmas. We got immediate water service and chips with two types of salsa. One was muy caliente, the other not so much. I guess my expectations for a five start mex place would be a five star salsa...I was disappointed.  Their menu selection is remarkable and affordable.  If I still lived in the area, I would be a regular!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love la Unica! There cheese dip is delish. Dalia is an awesome waitress FYI"}
{"text":"Definitely not a place to go for food - maybe for drinks but this food was tasteless, bland, and not something I want to experience again. The ambience is very cool, they have a nice patio area and the inside is spacious but still intimate. Unfortunately the service was not as fast or attentive as what I am used to and didn't know much about the menu. Again the food was the worst I've had while in Charlotte. The only thing that was worth any time was the spicy salsa and chips which you could buy at Walmart. The area that the restaurant is in is in a growing neighborhood of Plaza Midwood which is great but this place does not hold a. Andre to other restaurants in the area. Just go to Azteca on Woodlawn."}
{"text":"Quick update to say this place still rocks!  Great, authentic Mexican with a varied menu.  We paid another visit this past Friday night and as we sat looking at every table and booth full and people waiting at the door we just smiled.  Knowing that this kind of support (and they are busy pretty much any day/time) means that this little nugget of joy will remain just down the street.  La Unica is a great example of what good food and service, done consistently, can do even in a ho-hum, strip mall location.  Word gets around!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is the day to go!!! Dollar tacos plus a margarita tower resulted in a $20 tab which is something I can sleep comfortably about. Authentic food and drinks but service can be slow."}
{"text":"My wife had the veggie fajitas and I had arroz con pollo. Both were delicious with flour tortillas and chips and salsa!  It was hot outside so the air conditioning was so nice.   We will definitely return."}
