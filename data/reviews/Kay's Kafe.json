{"text":"Good, homemade breakfast! Don't be scared by the location. Restaurant is spacious, clean, with friendly staff and delicious food! I would recommend."}
{"text":"SO RANDOM. SO GOOD. Came close to running scared when I saw this place. Don't run. The food is Fantastic.  Service was casual and comfortable. This is Clearly a family-run spot with everyone doing what they are good at.  No frills, but random enough to be entertaining.  A few pseudo-sophisticated dishes (very well prepared) such as the orange marmalade/cream cheese stuffed French toast and the overall yum factor of the classics, keeps this from being a typical diner.  Did I mention how random....?"}
{"text":"Well first of all, by the mere fact that its not even off Buckeye Road, but is off LOWER Buckeye Road, far away enough from any place that any normal, authentic Zony would ever be even relatively close to, Kay's Kafe still stays full from 5:30am to 2pm with some of the most authentic citizens of our great state of Arizona. The reason: amazing food, good parking, some of the friendliest waitresses around, cheaply priced, and to be perfectly redundant, excellent food. 

Just one piece of advice: do NOT order just a scoop of tuna when you are at Kay's. The tuna tastes just splendid, but at a place with great food that the chef's put all their heart into, you'd just be wasting not only your time, but you'd be wasting the time of those who eat at Kay's and who work at Kay's. It would almost be like disrespecting your own family by not eating your mother's or grandmother's food. (the reason for this diatribe is because I oversaw someone on another table order just a scoop of tuna, and everyone at this person's table literally flipped out, and rightly so)

More specifically though, the chili beans, waffles, omelettes, every burger on the menu, the beef dip sandwich with au jus, the lemonade, and basically everything else on the menu really does taste good. Its worth the drive out, and definitely worth the drive back home. 

As Abraham Lincoln once said, \"Be sure you put your feet in the right place, then stand firm.\" And that place Abe's speaks about you may ask? Kay's Kafe. From 5:30am to 2pm every day of the week, Kay's is where you can stand firm with some good food, and even better company."}
{"text":"Good food and really appreciate a place where you can get in and out in a timely manner at lunch.

Had the BLT it was done well and the didn't hold back on the bacon."}
{"text":"We found Kay's right here through yelp. I feel we had a good solid diner style meal. Kay's exceeded the average expectations I have for diner food.

They had a stake and egg burrito ($6) on the specials list and let me have it as a scramble instead. I feel the beef was noticeably above par. (BTW: my husbands family live on a cattle ranch.) The staff was friendly but it did take a extra second for one of the waitresses to come over and let me pay the bill. She apologized as she walked up and in reality it was not that long a wait. With something like that being my only complaint, I'll be going back anytime I'm in town."}
{"text":"There are not a lot of choices on near Laveen for breakfast, so when my boyfriend came from Ahwatukee to Laveen to see me for breakfast, I had heard about Kay's but had never ventured there. So, we headed to Kay's and drove by it because it is situated off of a truck yard. Greeted by smiles as we entered, we sat down at a table and we offered drinks and handed menus. As we were browsing the menus, a gentleman came by, I suppose it was the owner. He was friendly and jovial. We ordered the chicken fried steak with a side of biscuits and gravy and split our food. The chicken fried steak was a little over cooked but absolutely fabulous. All of the other food was outstanding. I have to say the mixed crowd of people and homey atmosphere definitely made it my new choice of breakfast venues in the area."}
{"text":"A very family friendly restaurnt with great food and wonderful customer service.  My wife and I try to eat there every Saturday."}
{"text":"Their burritos are bomb! Been there twice and plan to re-visit! Recommended. Great service."}
{"text":"I just had the ham and eggs and hashbrowns  and my wife had the Greek  omelet. Wow so good.  Had them add onions and peppers to the  hashbrowns.  This is probably the 9th  or 10th  time  eating here at KAYS.  ALWAYS BEEN  GREAT."}
{"text":"Always great service when I stop in! French toast and Greek omelette for me and the lady. Thank you for the great hospitality. See you guys soon!"}
{"text":"Thanks yelp  live in Phoenix first time here will be back. Staff understand exceedingly customer expectations. Pancakes great. Exceptionally clean and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"So happy to find this little gem in our neck of the woods -- but also well worth the trip from anywhere in the Valley. 

For those interested in supporting local establishments put this one on your list. It's family owned for over 30 years and the owners live in Laveen. It's easy to get to but a bit tricky to find only because it's located in an industrial area and you think you may have made a wrong turn. The inside is remodeled - clean, friendly, and homey. 

Ross and I tried the chorizo and cheese omelet (served with tortillas) because of the Yelp reviews below and we were not disappointed. YUMMY. We also tried a Texas-sized pancake...HUGE....seriously. Next time we hope to try the Chilaquiles! 

Awesome service and great food!"}
{"text":"We got there at 8:00 a.m. Very few were there,  just a couple tables.  And I see why.  The gravy was good the biscuits were more like old bread,  way less then exceptable.  The Spanish omelette was mediocre at best.  The toast and hash browns tasted to be pre-cooked and reheated and gross. There was also an awful smell in the cafe. Fix it Kay and I will remove this review."}
{"text":"We were looking for breakfast restaurant for all the time. The restaurant is hidden behind wall but clean nice delicious home made food. We had breakfast burrito and pancakes- the were unbelievable good. Next time we will try something else. We are so happy to find this place. None of food are greasy like I hop or Waffle House or Denny's. Very good food reasonably priced and very nice host. Also it is family own restaurant- all the money spent will be stay in Arizona- we should try to support our local business."}
{"text":"Great food. Super nice staff! Everyone is friendly and helpful. The food tastes delicious and homemade. To enter, follow the green sign."}
{"text":"This place has by far the best food and service... don't be shy it's a seat yourself place. Owner always says \"HI\" and is the nicest man alive...love this family run spot... FYI you will drive right past it if you aren't looking..turn right bright green sign"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast locations in Phoenix. A little hard to find, but well worth the extra effort.

The Texas-Size blueberry pancakes are a must!

The wait staff are extremely kind and actually remember who you are by name each time you visit.

Kay's absolutely embarrasses overrated and overhyped breakfast locations like Matt's Big Breakfast hands down."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast! It's always clean and the servers are wonderful and attentive. Try the Texas style pancakes or the chorizo omelette.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried Kay's today on the advice of some local residents in the area and couldn't be more impressed.  This is not a place you're going to find on accident by just happening to drive by.  It is tucked (and I mean TUCKED) in behind some trailers & warehouses and you'd never know it was there if you weren't looking for it.  We drove right by it, and the only thing that saved us was the address on a sign out by the road.  But when we got turned around and drove into the driveway, it opened up to a little warehouse looking diner with a good number of cars in the parking lot.

The inside is quite a lot larger than you would think by looking at the outside of the building.  It was nice and roomy and didn't feel like people were all sitting on top of one another.  The wait staff was friendly and we were seated really quickly.  The goodly number of other people there before us didn't slow down our service at all.

I had the Irish Eggs Benedict and thought they were awesome.  The hash browns were the best I've ever had, bar none.  I wish I knew their secret.  They were thick, fluffy on the inside, and the perfect golden crunch on the outside.

My niece got a blueberry pancake, which really was the size of Texas.  It was the most enormous pancake I have ever seen in my entire life.  It was thick, fluffy, and the blueberries inside it were amazing.  Not wimpy, or wilted or over cooked but fresh and plump and delicious.

My sister's Greek omelette was a work of art.  Spinach, feta cheese and tomatoes were the stars of the show, and they put on a beautiful performance.  It was a beautiful, beautiful thing.  I will be going back for a Greek omelette of my own soon - very soon.

The owner (whose name unfortunately I can't remember) was a delight.  He came over to introduce himself and he was witty, and charming and seemed genuinely concerned that we enjoyed our meal and were happy with his restaurant.  I've eaten at places from the east coast all the way to the west coast, and I have found only a handful of places where you can get a breakfast as delicious and satisfying as the breakfast we had at Kay's this morning.

The only un-positive thing about my experience was the bill.  We were a party of 5, and I discovered when I went to add the tip to my credit card receipt that it had already been added automatically.  I didn't remember that it had said anywhere that a gratuity was included, so maybe I missed it.  We had enjoyed our meal so much that the tip that was automatically assessed by Kay's was actually less than I had intended to leave.  I felt that was unfortunate for the wait staff.

If I could give you one piece of advice, it would be \"GO!\""}
{"text":"Excellent food in a very rustic location. The owner visited every table and was quite enjoyable to talk to."}
{"text":"Never any wait!  Great staff! Fantastic food!  Be sure to talk to the owner, John for some history about the cafe along with his funny jokes. Chorizo and eggs are my favorite.  AND not to forget they have red and white menudo in Saturday's."}
{"text":"The chorizo was delish! It was a little hard to find;but definitely worth the search."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this morning and I'm sure glad I did! I had the best Mexican Eggs Benedict I have ever tried! 
The chorizo and poached eggs were perfectly cooked and the sauce was delicious. They only serve this dish on Saturdays. 
I'm putting this place on my list of favorite breakfast places and looking forward to trying some other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"If you're lazy (like me) and don't want to cook breakfast, this is the place for you. They sell the typically breakfast items at very affordable prices. The server was friendly and the food came out fast.

My only complaints were the water tasted very off. Could not take more than a sip. Also they charge almost 4 dollars for orange juice, pretty pricey for store bought orange juice."}
{"text":"I had a business meeting down the street from Kay's and Yelp lead me here for some breakfast to get the day going.  This place is in the middle of nowhere. The only things nearby are industrial buildings and warehouse space. It's very easy to miss driving by as it looks just like another warehouse from the street.  

The restaurant is pretty big when you get inside with a counter and good number of tables.  We were greeted warmly by the servers and asked to pick any table.  They were really nice and the place had a cool homey feel to it.  I had a breakfast burrito, no meat, add green chills and it was really good.  If you happen to be way over on that side of town this is a great place for breakfast.

Try:

- Breakfast Burrito"}
{"text":"In my opinion i think it was actually one of the best breakfast i ever had.
Very friendly environment also the price for the food is perfect I would perfare coming here for breakfast then and other place.
I recommend there waffle special."}
{"text":"This is just one of them ol school joints that if you don't know about, you'll pass it by. However, once you stop in & grab a bite to eat, you'll make it a point to come back!! I got turned on to it about 20 yrs. ago & been patronizing ever since. AND... I've been a hero to the many friends I've brought along for the ride!! They too have been returning ever since. The food is terrific, the choices are plentiful & the people/atmosphere makes you hang around long after your finished eating...."}
{"text":"Love going to Kay's on a Saturday morning when I don't feel like cooking after a late Friday night. I have never had a bad meal at Kay's, though I only eat breakfast here. Omelets and hash browns are my favorite. This is a great family owned business and very friendly service. If you don't know where it's located, it can be hard to find. In fact, you might think you are lost when you arrive. Worth the hunt!"}
{"text":"I've had lunch here a couple of times and have liked what I've had to eat. They have a good grilled cheese and chili special but will let you know that the grilled cheese was probably made with American cheese singles, which was ok because it made dunking the sandwich into the chili easier. I've also had their French dip sandwich with fries which wasn't that bad. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"There are too many places to eat out here that aren't fast food. We tried this place after I saw it on yelp. It was very good. The pictures don't do it justice. I will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Really good food, exelente service,  a diferent place, love this place I recommended 100% you will love it..."}
{"text":"First time here and it was great. Good food (giant pancakes), great family that runs the place.  Casual and comfy. Can't wait to go back for their lunch!"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall place, worth the visit. We stumbled across this place and I'm so glad we stopped by. The menu isn't overwhelming at all. There  is a good selection of food. We came for breakfast, so I'm not sure if there is a different menu for lunch/dinner. The food came out a few mins after ordering. The portions aren't huge to wheee you can't finish it, but big enough to definitely fill you up! The parking area can be confusing at first, but there is definitely space. Might be a small thing, but their water doesn't taste like tap water, you can tell it's filtered or something. If you're looking for a good, new place to eat at, give this place a try!! :)"}
{"text":"Been to Kay's before and I thought I had reviewed it. We arrived at 11 on a Saturday and it was busy but not full. The cashier/hostess (Kay) was overwhelmed with the two parties going out so she gruffly waved at a table and grunted, so we sat down. 

Our server offered us menus 10 MINUTES LATER. Once we got our drinks, they were mostly empty for the rest of the meal. 

The meal: I ordered biscuits and gravy with a side of corned beef hash. My son in law got an omelette. The biscuits were fine but the gravy was pretty bad. They needed to cook it a lot longer cuz it had a raw flour taste. Could've used some sausage in there too!  The hash was excellent. 

Poor gravy and awful service: I don't see the need to come back. Too bad cuz it's closer to home. Guess I'll head back to downtown. Sigh."}
{"text":"This is a great little place! This is the kind of diner that most places in the valley wish they could be!!! The food has FLAVOR! The staff is FUN!!! The other customers are nice! Yea there are a few cops that go there, however I've never seen a cop put food down. Even if there was a 211 in progress!!! You'd never think of looking for this place and I drove past it TWICE when I WAS looking for it!!! This is truly a hidden gem!!! It is just a good diner that brings all of what a good diner should be together nicely!!!!! 
BTW yourself a favor and try the BLT!!!"}
{"text":"Nice quiet place for breakfast or an early lunch. Staff was polite and friendly. I ordered the classic eggs Benedict which was good. Portion sizes are very generous. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I had high hopes for this place and brought 4 students with me to try it as an end of the year breakfast. Service was not very friendly. Our order came out the hash browns were so-so. The Texas blueberry panacake was delicious. Our waitress never asked how the meal was. 

Our main issue was the way this small business is handling their policies regarding automatic gratuity and not splitting checks. Their menu stated \"parties of 6 or more no separate checks\". The waitress waited until it was time for us to pay to tell us that the policy \"just changed\". Fine, I paid the entire check for my students but they added automatic gratuity for having 5 people. The policy was 6 or more. She responds that they've had issues with people not tipping. So, are you assuming I won't? If a policy can change within 40 minutes of customers being seated, it would be good business practice to make them aware. I wanted to like this place but the service ruined it for me."}
{"text":"WIth an area that is lacking a nice place to go for lunch this place really hits the spot.  Service is great and food is excellent."}
{"text":"ordered the huevos con chorizo. it was kinda pricey for the amount of food that was served. plus, the chorizo was pretty bland. i went in the morning and the place was packed with police/sheriff officers who stared at me because i didnt have a uniform."}
{"text":"Mine and my husband's first time here. Food was great, service was great, the owner came to our table to check up and make sure everything was great! Very nice and respectful gentlemen. Too bad we're coming from California but when we're in town this will definitely be our to go breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a great breakfast place in Laveen since I moved out here. This is the place! It looks shady when you drive up but fear not - great food and service."}
{"text":"Not a good place to go if you have a big party. We waited for over an hour for our food and drinks! Also our ticket was mixed up with another. We complained to Trina but she didnt care to hear about it. This is our last time here and we'll be  giving Black Bear Diner a try. We hear their food is awesome."}
{"text":"well after all the hype i cant say i would rush back ...it wasnt bad although my eggs were barley cooked and i think the eggs i got were suppose to go to my wife but they were still undercooked the service was good and the location yet hidden was a cool funky area very industrial........."}
{"text":"A solid breakfast. Quick and tasty. I got the chicken fried steak. Not the best I have ever had, but quite tasty."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great breakfast, friendly staff, and great service this is the spot! I initially was indecisive between the classic eggs Benedict or the chorizo egg Benedict but the owner recommended I try something new! Spam Eggs Benedict!!!! Placed on an English muffin and topped with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce! The spam was not too salty at all and just the right amount of savory I needed! Very yummy! They definitely need this item added to the menu!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times on Saturday mornings and have never been disappointed. Some visits service can be slow, but it is a very busy family restaurant. I usually get a bacon and cheese omelette and it has been great each time. I have had the huge waffle once as well and that was really good! Friendly service, sometimes a little slower because it's busy, but the good is consistently good and I will continue to return."}
{"text":"First time visiting this secret gem. Holy Cow!  What a find.  The prices are fair, the portions are big, and (more importantly) the food is good.  My wife has an interesting list of food allergies that are always interesting to deal with at any restaurant. Kay's didn't even bat an eye and met all my wife's needs. This place is just awesome and is now our favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"Just solid breakfast. All good choices. Love the chorizo breakfast burrito with onions and Bell peppers added. The Irish eggs Benedict is certainly something to try for as well. This is my new favorite place for breakfast"}
{"text":"Love this spot. Food is excellent and the staff could not be friendlier. I can see why there are so many that come here over the many years."}
{"text":"Your major is sociology and the assignment is exploring idiosyncrasies of various counter cultures. 
But you procrastinated when the professor was doling out the choices. 
Now there are only two left. 
Rednecks and Bikers.
You choose the former, but now comes the dilemma. 
Where in Phoenix can you study rednecks in their natural habitat? (bars and brothels excluded)
Well look no further. Kay's is your first stop. 

Kay's is located in an industrial section of Phoenix surrounded by farms, nearby cattle ranches and all around shit.
Surrounded by junkyards, (replete with junkyard dogs) - packs of wild dogs roaming the streets and a gigantic garbage dump next door -  Kay's offers the finest in redneck watching.
Yes,the people who harbor these dogs, drive combines, milk cows, and do garbage dumpy stuff all light here, at Kay's.

Yes, Kay's will deliver that down-home atmosphere you're seeking, that is, if down home happens to be the back woods of West Virginia.
Home to the dentifrice challenged, Kay's is where men wear Wranglers, Roper boots, and all things Carrhart. No fancy jeans here.
Here you'll find men whose musk isn't Old Spice or Axe, but Dow Chemical's #105 or Union Carbide's Weevil 'B Gone. 
Go inside, take a seat and eavesdrop on the next table, let's get started with that assignment, shall we?

Redneck breakfast-goer:  \"N  I told that little brown puke, this here's Amerca boy, 'n if you don't like it,you can gettttt  the fuuuuckkkk out!, you lil rice-eatin, bean-fartin motherfucker.\"

Redneck's little buddy:  \"N  whad he say Earll?\"

Redneck:   \"Lil sumbitch jumped in his '64 Impala 'n made tracks, probably fer Me-hee-co.\" 

Little buddy:  \"Sposin you tol him Earll.\"

I love going to Kay's for breakfast, but never lunch, even though their lunch specials are to die for. Especially the cheeseburger - one of the best in Phoenix.

The breakfasts,especially if you get there around sun up when you'll get to see all these scourilous knaves in their natural habitat, sipping coffee, wolfing lumberjack specials even Denny's would envy, are the total shit!
I typically get a bowl of cream of wheat and a couple poached eggs. It comes to nine bucks with coffee and the tip. A little pricey but not when you consider you're smack dab in the middle of a cornucopia of societal throwbacks.
Well worth it. 

I love going to Kay's. 
Listening in on the conversations. 
Wondering just how it is Phoenix managed to adopt a little piece of Appalachia in its own backyard.
And being a part of a contra culture Jeff Foxworthy would drool over.

Note: I should probably mention the owners are nicest folks you'll ever meet and, there are a lot of police in here too. Police must identify with rednecks I suppose.

One more thing.
Since I gave you the tip on Kay's, I expect to be included in your footnotes."}

{"text":"We're from California so weren't sure where to have a good meal & we chose this spot solely based on reviews and it didn't disappoint! Loved the welcoming,clean,family oriented environment. The location does seem random as you're driving down road passed all the industrial buildings but as soon as we walked in we could just tell it was going to be some great food and it sure was. Staff was friendly and food was delivered to us in just a short amount of time. Biscuits and gravy were delicious, French toast, and sausage burrito with green enchilada sauce mmm mmmm mmmm. We got to meet the owner John and wow what an incredible humble human being he is, he almost brought us to tears by just greeting us the way he did. God bless him! Next time we're in AZ we are definitely coming back and bringing our family."}
{"text":"I appreciate great food when I find one. And this my fellow yelpers is hidden gem near Laveen. Read ahead for fora full review.

Short review- the area can be intimidating at first, but believe me the flavor is amazing, worth the trip. They have traditional American breakfast food but runs specials on the weekends. I tried their hearty breakfast w/c comes in different meat along with hash and toast. Their flavor is just outstanding, the patty melted with the hashbrown and with an egg on the side- it was just heaven. Portions are huge and price is cheap. If my pictures does not convince you to try it out- I hope this review does.

Detailed and long review. Came here on a Saturday with gf. Got a hard time finding the place and that was using Google map, when they say it's \"tucked in\" they really mean it's tucked and hidden. The place caters to the surrounding  area and have alot of patrons. What they lack my friendly yelpers are elites coming and representing the area! They have been here for years!Back with the food- Their patty is very juicy and the egg benedict is just out of this world with their flavor. 

I hope the pictures will convince more yelpers to come over and check it out."}
{"text":"Update: I totally gave 5 stars but after coming a few more times, I noticed the waiting times were sometimes so bad, I would simply give up after waiting more than 15 minutes just to place an order, then even more waiting time for the food to arrive.
I am usually patient when it comes to preparing the food but I don't think it takes more than 15 minutes to take your order... 
About the food (when it makes its way within a reasonable time), I also noticed it is unfortunately not consistent in quality.

Initial review:
The friendly owner is not afraid to chat with you, parents come with kids, and the food is just awesome. The location is surprisingly a little away from other businesses, but it was a great breakfast experience.
Of course don't expect the red carpet and brand new furniture, I prefer eating well in a friendly environment with a menu which does not look like an encyclopedia instead of a cold fancy 5 stars restaurant with terrible food..."}
{"text":"Very happy that I was able to find this little gem using yelp.  I great little hidden away little diner.  Service was prompt, server was curteous and attentive, and my Ortega Burger was quick to the table and tasty . . . can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"Basic diner food, with a south of border feel. Very attentive service; in fact, we had our meal within five minutes of sitting down.

Tables, by the way  - no booths. Like that a lot.

Chorizo omelets, with a choice of toast or flour or corn tortillas. Menudo. Giant pancakes. You get the flavor.

On the downside, my wife's pancake came with a dollop of margarine that probably came out of a 1/2 gallon tub of GoldnSoft. She's addicted to real butter. And, her bacon was a little too salty.

But, overall, I enjoyed Kay's  Kafe. I will return."}
{"text":"Great breakfast or lunch stop ! Try the Chorizo Omelet for starters. They have great soups made fresh daily and build a mean club sandwich. I love this place because Its where real people go to eat. Situated in a largely industrial area that caters to local blue collar workers with a few suits thrown in.  The service is as great as the food, what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful place to have a great homemade breakfast! The food was just like grandma used to make. My fiancé had chorizo which all the police officers recommended....and it did not disappoint. I had the waffle special and got a side of the orange marmalade so dang yummy! The owner John is the reason this place is great! He went around to each table and greeted his customers. Wow what a great experience!"}

Vanessa who is a part owner was fantastic, friendly and happy to help us.  The food is awesome, we took my parents there before taking them to the airport, and we ordered the grill cheese with a cup of potato soup.  Soup was really home made, no imitation taters used here, and the grill cheese was very delish.  Mom ordered a ruben - was great, Dad had the roast beef, and my husband had the Irish Benedict -which was delicious- I think he might have licked his plate clean.  The service was very fast and friendly.  We will definitely be back, although Vanessa is not a Dallas Cowboy fan! lol"}

He is a genuine man , he's very personable , and takes extra time to acknowledge everyone in the restaurant! We highly recommend this place for EVERYONE !"}
{"text":"Came because of Yelp reviews and I needed a lunch spot in the neighborhood. Breakfast served until 2pm and pancake reviews led me to choose breakfast. Pancakes were phenomenal and monstrously huge. But.. I left off a star because my eggs, hash browns and sausage were just ok and they came out a full 4 minutes before my pancake. I kept waiting for the pancake to come before I ate my eggs and unfortunately that meant my eggs got cold... :-(. Service also was slow especially refills but on total a very good hidden gem."}
{"text":"We have heard about this spot from a few different people, but had not tried it out until recently. We went last week and loved that it is close by, local, owned by the Montalvo's, and just a good feeling place! The food was great, the vibe was good and we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I have no clue how this place got almost 5 star reviews. But if I had to guess they are asking their local customers to give them this rating. The location is hard to find tucked away behind other buildings surrounded by a junkyard/tow facility. The condition of this place is I guess I would say worn out.  
But being honest most people only care about the food. Nothing special that's all I could say very limited menu for breakfast I'm guessing waffles and pancakes are the specialty as they seem to have gotten the most coverage in the menu.  
Giving this place a 5 star rating is like giving McDonald's 10 stars. Sorry to all those folks that think this place is so great but I guess you've never actually been to a five star restaurant
Because this place isn't even close

Delicious breakfast and early lunch spot in a commercial industrial area. Food simple and satisfying.  Family Run business wth John at the helm cracking his corny jokes.  Loved the warmth which he says has been 23 years worth. Our orders were the chorizo burrito, tamale and eggs w beans and ham wth poached eggs/hollandaise sauce.  All yummy and as John says \"tell your friends \"."}
{"text":"Wow, I finally found this place,  about 7 min from my home, we was greeted by the owner that made us feel welcome. we will be returning."}
{"text":"Kays is simply faaabulous!  Family owned, incredible fpod, excellent qualiru, clean and smiles wall-to-wall!!  Senor Montavo is a true treasure!!  Make this your first trip!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is very friendly. I had the Irish eggs Benedict and it was very tasty. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a delicious breakfast spot"}
{"text":"As other reviews note,  this is a family- owned diner and not flashy.   We're here on a Wed mid-morning, and there are many empty tables, only 4 tables filled in the front area and a couple in the side room.  Considering that, service is very, very slow in the kitchen.   Our 2 omelettes took over 35 minutes to arrive.   The kitchen must be backed up but not sure with whose meals. Glad we're not in a hurry. 2nd time here, likely not coming back. As a former grill cook, breakfast is easy and fast and should not take this long."}
{"text":"I have done a few breakfasts here and it has always been solid.  Tried the lunch today with a friend and it was great.  I went very basic...side salad (which was huge) and a burger.   After we ordered the food was to us within 5 minutes.   Everything tasted great."}
{"text":"Took my 79-year-old father there this morning and he loved it he had the chorizo and eggs I had a chicken fried steak and eggs very very good food we will return"}
{"text":"I went and ate breakfast at this place twice in a weeks time frame. 

First just as many other reviews notate, it's a surprise pulling into an industrial park just to find this cafe hidden between them all. 

Don't judge anything about the location. 

They're very personable and accurate with order taking. 

Food was delivered fresh from kitchen. Hot. Delicious. 

I was impressed with everything at this location. 

Not to mention I just seen them in the news for receiving a perfect score on a health inspection!!! 

This will be a place I frequent going forward, for sure. 

Btw. They only serve breakfast. Limited hours."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp while passing thru Phoenix from California. Walking in we were told we could sit wherever we'd like. A man named John came over to our table to greet us and in conversation told us that he was also from California.  He started the restraunt over 20 years ago. He was a lovely man who had a huge smile and an even bigger personality! You can tell he enjoys being in the biz and his presence was very refreshing in an unfamiliar place. The food we ordered came out and it tasted just right.  Just what we needed to start our day. John, thank you for your overwhelming welcome and your kind spirit. This will definitely be our go to breakfast spot when passing thru Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast spots I've been too. I'm not a breakfast person and I LOVED it. Very clean FAST service. No wait. The signs they put up makes it easy to find since it IS a little hidden. Loved that it was family owned and run. The food was amazing. Waffle was delicious and crispy. Great T-bone steak and eggs. Chorizo was yummy. Coffee is good and my cup was never empty. Beans stole the show though. They are SO good."}
{"text":"Came to eat brunch with the wife and their place was pretty full. You seat yourself. Pancakes are huge and delicious. Got sausage and eggs. 5 *'s."}
{"text":"Took my family and neighbors to breakfast.  My boys absolutely loved the Texas pancakes and my neighbor was very pleased with the french toast.  The service is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Friendly people. Don't make any ideas of the surroundings, the place is set in the middle of nowhere, but it's worth the visit. We loved having breakfast and taking the time to talk to the owners. Great Benedict eggs!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, better service. 

Tucked away in an industrial complex is a little restaurant worthy of praise. The food was excellent, not super greasy like most diner type places, and the service was excellent. The waitresses were especially friendly and even laughed with us after I managed to spill my water all over the place. 

I don't make it out here often but when I do I'll make sure to come back."}
{"text":"Me and my brother were driving around craving breakfast food and left it up to Google to lead us in the direction of the closest establishment. Low and behold Kay's Kafe appeared with a great rating. We decided to give it a try. A small, modest restaurant hidden away among the surrounding industrial buildings. Once we were inside we were greeted promptly and asked to sit where ever we would like. My brother ordered the steak and eggs, with a pancake on the side and I opted for the red tamale with beans and over easy eggs. Amazing! The tamale was cooked perfectly. The masa to meat ratio was spot on and moist. THE PANCAKE WAS HUGE. Don't be fooled by the low price. This bad boy is big, thick and super filling. The steak and eggs were more of a thin, carne asada or flank steak type meat, but complimented the eggs great. We we so impressed with the price, quality and taste we returned again today. We were again great warmly upon entering. While waiting for our food the owner John was making his way around greeting and thanking everyone for coming out. His daughter Christy, I believe was her name, was taking our ordering bringing us our food. They both made us feel very welcome and seemed genuinely interested in us and who we were as people and not just customers. My husband ordered the two carne asada tostadas with rice and beans, my oldest son ordered the bacon omelet, my youngest ordered the Mickey Mouse pancake, bacon with fruit and a side of eggs, my brother ordered the chili burger and I stuck with the tamale egg and beans. All the selections were amazing. The chili was rich and meaty. The tostadas were huge. My younger son really enjoyed the Mikey Mouse pancake and it was definitely a fun change for him than the normal plan circles. We have definitely decided to make this a weekend staple four our family. The prices are extremely reasonable, but they are only open for breakfast and lunch so don't wait too long to enjoy some homestyle cooking!"}
{"text":"Kay's surprised the hell out of me!!

I thought this would be a greasy spoon, serving heart attacks, but I had a very healthy order of chicken, rice and broccoli. The chicken was over cooked and a bit dry, but the flavor was there without the fat/butter/grease. Also, the water mellow was so fresh and crisp with a sweet flavor. Service was solid too!

What a great option in the industrial west side."}
{"text":"I was out for a motorcycle ride and decided to Yelp breakfast locations and I found a hidden gem... Kay's Kafe. Not the easiest place to find , tucked behind some buildings but well worth the effort. I ordered the Chorizo omelet with a side of beans that was delicious and tasty. I will be back with the family."}
{"text":"We usually hit this place up on Saturdays, and it is usually pretty busy.  I enjoy simple diner food and this place is top notch. I don't think I have had anything twice, besides the pancakes, because of the different choices.  The owner is often there when we go and is friendly and welcoming. The service is good and usually pretty quick."}
{"text":"I want to like this place desperately as its one of the only alternatives to fast food by my house. I've been twice and have been thoroughly disappointed. Their version of the French dip is terrible (their \"au jus\" is tasteless gravy). However, their pancakes are HUGE and acceptable. The staff are also extremely friendly.

I'll definitely try again in the future just to avoid fast food, but I would never go out of my way to come to this place."}
{"text":"Breakfast and lunch are good prices for plenty of real homemade food. Love their pancakes and onion rings so it's always hard to decide if I want breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Great place for bfast the menudo is amazing!! And the staff is very friendly! Would recommend this place to anyone that loves a good breakfast or lunch. Definitely going here again I love this place!"}
{"text":"The owners made us laugh and smile while we enjoyed the lovely breakfast and latte's they have to offer."}
{"text":"Great lil place for breakfast! Husband and I both had eggs over medium, one sausage, one bacon, hash browns and sourdough toast. Everything was cooked perfect. Very good, fast service!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food, Excellent service:-) Variety of items to choose from depending on your taste for the day. Portions are more than enough. Loved it!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here early morning for breakfast, while it was still dark out. I couldn't find the place, it's kinda hidden. Anyway so i made it, the food is good.
You don't have many options in this industrial part of the city. I work a few blocks away from here so it's nice to have a decent place to eat close by."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast and lunch. Family owned and run, this is a definite recommendation to anyone.  I have tried just about everything on the menu and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"If you are familiar with Laveen you know there is no place close by for a sit down breakfast. This is your little hometown family-run place.  
The five stars are because they have been around for a long time, a definitely a word of mouth place and the owner does show that he cares as he makes his rounds to all the customers. Breakfast is a decent portion and they have all the typical things you would expect: waffles, omeletss, French toast, pancakes, biscuits and gravy, etc. 
Lunch is your sandwiches, burgers, soups, etc. 


I will say I feel I get more coldness from the \"regulars\" especially if you sat at their table."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. This little family restaurant is out in a warehouse area, but it's so delicious. The food is made from scratch and has flavor. We ordered the Texas size pancake and it was too much to eat. The biscuits and gravy were great as well. The place had lots of customers, but still managed to get all the orders right and came to check if we needed anything else. The staff was very friendly as well. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden jewel. Delicious food and great service. We will definitely continue to come here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Ever heard, I want to go where everyone knows my name....yup, this place has that. Plus yummy food. It is my go to breakfast place. Love the staff, how close I am to it, and the ambiance. It is one of my favorite places to go. :0)"}
{"text":"Great place!  This is a gem hidden in an industrial area.  I initially was confused and almost turned away, so glad we didn't. Good food, awesome service we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is decently priced, tasty, and filling. My only complaint is the older woman who is the cashier. She is very rude and unpleasant. The rest of the staff, including the male owner is great."}
{"text":"this place is very unique. it really has great food, i took a picture of the back of the menu that tells the story of this place, it's quite intriguing! i walked in and the lady told me the debit/credit machine is down:( was slightly disappointed because this is where i wanted to eat! so i had to go to quick trip down the road and grab some cash out of the ATM. not to big of a deal, but this would turn most people to another place to eat. i ordered the chorizo plate. the food came with a choice of tortilla's or bread, i got tortillas of course! food was really good and fresh, and you can tell the kitchen is clean cause you can see it! the chorizo unfortunately was not spicy at all, but it was really good so i'm not going to complain to much. i would definately recommend this place because it's really the only decent place around this commercial warehouse area that you can sit down and relax, maybe do some computer work if ya need. it's really perfect for lunch meetings or even breakfast meetings. try it out. you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"LOVED the customer service. Everyone is so nice. Food was filing and delicious.... needed a bit more seasoning but still good. I had the veggie omelet and hubby had the Denver. Try their biscuits!! Everything for just $30. Open from 7am to 1pm only. Will return!!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times for lunch. They have daily specials along with a regular menu. A combination of your regular diner food mixed with some Mexican food. Today I got the philly with fries. Was it the best philly I've had? No. But here's the deal, I like the feel and energy of this place. It's a family owned diner and they make you feel welcome. The owner comes around and thanks you for coming in and takes the time to have a conversation with you. The service has been friendly and fast. It's a bustling gathering place of working class, business class, and families. I can get down with that."}
{"text":"Great mom n pop diner! The food tastes so freshly homemade and the customer service is very personable. Look for the sign off 43rd or you will miss it."}
