{"text":"Have been here many times. The fried chicken is the best in N.E. Ohio. I have also had the sirloin steak and wings which are excellent too! The bar is never overcrowded and is a great place to meet friends or catch a game. It has an intimate feel to it. Service has always been above average and they have several beers on tap."}
{"text":"This location was formerly East Park and it now has a new name and new owner.  

Upon walking into the bar area I was greeted with the huge smile of the owner Lisa Irwin.  She is super friendly and upbeat and this being my first time here I was looking around as I sat at the bar and pretty much gasped and thought this is the cleanest restaurant I have ever been to in my life.  Everything was so clean.  

I loved the hand dipped onion rings and wings!!    I also ordered the all you can eat salad bar, it was fresh looking and clean and the attendant made sure each item looked fresh and not one item was wilted/over used/ ect.  the salad bar attendant was very prompt to refill items and asked me several times if everything was ok and if I needed her help.  

Overall I am very satisfied with my visit here and I wish I lived closer as I would be able to frequent them more often.  I definitely want to bring my husband here for dinner!  

Other aspects they offer a full bar with full menu and also offer free wifi and free meeting/banquet room area."}
{"text":"Met the owner and she is quite friendly and has a great place to eat and/or have a drink.  Very good food and excellent value.  We have been here 3 times and will continue to come for a long time.  I highly recommend this restaurant,"}
{"text":"Overall pretty good.  Had a sirloin steak here and it was seasoned and cooked as ordered.

Salad bar is sub par, but they probably have a tough time given the traffic through the resturant.  It was pretty sparse.. but we did have good service."}
