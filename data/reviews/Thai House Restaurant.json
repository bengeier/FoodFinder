{"text":"I've picked up food from this restaurant several times over 11 years and most of the time the food and customer service has been pretty good. The last time this new young girl who took my order (on the phone) took it down wrong in spite of my telling her twice what I wanted and when I got there to pick up the food she was extremely rude towards me and said that I didn't tell her what it was that I wanted when I noticed and mentioned that the order was incorrect. She was loud and snippy. She was probably on her cell phone for all I know while taking down my order. I called the owner or who I thought was the owner in Scottsdale where they own two other restaurants and the person who answered the phone was not of any help and said sometimes there is miscommunication by the customer and sometimes by the restaurant workers and said he'd talk to her. He sounded somewhat arrogant. After repeating my order twice you'd think she got it? Anyway neither one of them apologized. I don't think they know how to say \"sorry\" or be polite to their customers. This is what you get when you don't train your extremely young front desk staff people skills and customer service skills which completely ruins the reputation of a business."}
{"text":"Incredibly small restaurant and often crowded, but delicious food. The orange chicken, noodles and pad Thai left me wanting more"}
{"text":"This customer service was worst that I have received anywhere in the valley since moving here several months ago.  The lady who answered the phone was beyond rude on the phone when I was placing my orders.  I felt like I was being rushed off the phone before completely finished placing all my orders.  No may I help you when I came in to pick up my food, just a stare.  I had say I'm here to pick up an order.  My food was slammed down and almost pushed over the counter when I asked the lady about my orders to make sure everything was correct.  Then I get home to find that two of my three orders were wrong.  I will never return to this place.."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices! This is my go to when I'm in the mood for Thai food. Staff is really nice! Tip them!"}
{"text":"Whenever we visit my in-laws in Mesa we try to squeeze in a visit here. Even my wife, not a fan of Thai food,  frequently suggests take out. My regular order starts with Tom Yum soup then the entr√©e varies: pad thai with shrimp yesterday,  which I think will be repeated in future orders.  I can also recommend any of their curries. I skipped the Thai iced tea yesterday,  but that was only due to calorie count; also highly recommended"}
{"text":"Very consistent here. We come here at least twice a month. Our to go items here are : Tofu and vegetables (add) panang curry Vegetable green curry Tofu pad thai with no egg and added vegetables  Spicy fried rice veggies only Peanut sauce with their house salad Hubby loves the thai chilli fish (he always gets this) Thai tea with coconut cream instead of the dairy ( so yum ) Sticky rice and mango Truthfully though, a thai hot is never a thai hot here but food is pretty good so ensure you order extra thai hot if you like spicy but if not you will be just as good !!! Location is very small but we never had to wait more than 10 minutes to sit and eat even on a busy weekend night !"}
{"text":"Sooooo disappointed. I used to work at a Thai restaurant and I had been craving it terribly since coming back to Arizona, so I was pretty excited when I found this place; it was pretty close by and had lots of great reviews. I brought my little sister, who has never had Thai food before, and it makes me sad that this had to be her first experience.   She claims to love spicy food, but I know she can't handle it quite as well as she thinks, so I got a level 2 spicy on both dishes, since we were going to share. It was waayyy hotter than I had expected for being a 2 out of 5, and I have eaten my share of hot, authentic Thai food. My sister was hardly able to take two bites without a big gulp of water.   We ordered the shrimp Pad Thai and the Pad See Ew with beef, which I figured would be good introductory dishes. They were both very stale and old looking and tasting, though it took a long time to get to us from the kitchen (although there were only 4 of us in the restaurant...) so I assume they made it after the order was sent. Neither dish was fresh at all, the shrimp were NOT an ideal texture and the sauce on both dishes were not very good, the consistency was decent but lacking the proper flavor. The noodles and vegetables were limp and old. The Pad See Ew was slightly more palatable and my sister enjoyed it.   Really the only saving grace was that the staff was very friendly, attentive, and personable to us. This is not a place I would recommend if you want GOOD Thai food.  The environment was kind of old and shabby, as others have mentioned, but that really didn't bother me at all. What did bother me, was that there was trash sitting ALL over the place. There was not a clear space at the bar free from plates and cups and take out boxes and several tables were left covered as well. None of it was cleaned up in the time we spent there. I will be continuing my search to find good Thai food in Mesa, since it's not to be found here."}
{"text":"Our family really likes Thai House. We get the Spicy Basil Pork and Spicy Noodles almost weekly. It's become our #1 takeout. It's flawless each time. The balance of flavors in the dishes is really well balanced. We're lucky to have them in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Every time I'm anywhere near Power and Southern in Mesa around lunch time, this is my spot! The Massamon Curry chicken is the best I've ever had, and I eat a lot of Massamon curry. And at $8.95, it's even cheaper than many other Thai places. It's small, busy and loud at lunch time. Service is fast and friendly. It won't take as long as it looks when you first walk in right at noon."}
{"text":"Complete regret. Not authentic. It's a very dirty small shop and the worker was rude, I was hesitant but I was extremely hungry and I always give the benefit of the doubt. I had the pad thai and he had the spicy chicken... Have you ever eaten a cheap frozen Chinese TV dinner? That's exactly what it tasted like but worse. You know when you're hungry everything tastes bomb? This was not the case. My food lover boyfriend will eat ANYTHING, but he couldn't even handle it. It was greasy, sloppy, no flavor, pretty sure I'm going to have food poisoning/heart burn. We literally just threw it away after a few bites and ate at home. Worst money I've ever spent you'd have better chances going to panda express..."}
{"text":"Wanted Thai one evening and just did not want to drive far. Remembered seeing Thai House close to home and thought we would give it a try. SO glad we did!!  Small interior with seating for approx. 20 or so but did notice a lot of take orders heading out the door. The interior was very clean with minimal decor. Service was courteous and fast. The food (saving the BEST for last) was amazing. I had the curry and it was great. Loaded with chicken, lots of veggies that still maintained that slight crunch. The heat index was just as I had ordered. A very generous portion of \"done just right\" rice.  Prices were very affordable. We will return here again & again to sample other menu items."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best Thai curry in town for a killer price, then Thai House is the place to go.  With pleasant service and a good size selection of curry flavors, there's nowhere else I'd rather go for curry."}
{"text":"I found this place several years ago after moving here from Seattle (which has amazing Thai food).    This place is small but the food is crazy good.  I usually take out.  They have the BEST Tom Kai Gai soup in the valley (ok well Malees may compete), and simply yummy Chicken Satay.  Service is fast, food is consistent and awesome."}
{"text":"i love their Tom Kha it's really thick and creamy and the chicken is great. You do have to order it spicy but it's got an excellent flavor. The Panang is also really good, again i get it spicy. Their rice also has a nice sticky consistency. It is a hole in the wall and yes it can get crowded but overall it's a fun place to eat if it's just you and a friend."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and ordered a Thai tea and Spicy Eggplant Entre w/ Tofu, level 4 spice.   The ratio of Thai tea to milk was a little off with there being more milk than I preferred, but the spicy eggplant was excellent. Good flavor and the spiciness was just right.   I'll definitely be back to try their sticky rice :)"}
{"text":"I have been going here for a few years now for my curry fix. Food is very good for  the price. We only eat takeout usually because the place is very small, Its not a fun experience with a 2 kids. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's small and not the most fancy but oh boy is it delicious. The curry is divine and the noodles just right. Not to mention the custard topped sticky rice...my oh my!"}
{"text":"Always busy. Hole in the wall place. after finishing food I noticed tiny roaches crawling all over the clean plates and pointed it out to a worker and she smashed it on the plate and left the plate on the counter in the same stack!! (Not joking, F*ING nasty) Not enough seating to be comfortable forget a high chair. Very understaffed. I've called on several occasions to place an order and been told that they can't take my order bcuz they're \"to busy\" (really!!!) while standing in line today during lunch rush, I started calling on my phone to see if someone would attend to me any quicker...oh no. NO ONE answers the phone at all.  Not your typical customer service orientation.  I will not go back nor recommend! I Want to find another Thai place that's reasonable in price as well as attentive to guests. Any suggestions welcome!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Thai food since it generally has a nice mix of sweet, spicy, and salty flavors.  Luckily, the Phoenix east valley has a fair number of Thai restaurants to choose from.  We decided to give Thai House a try since we were in the area, thinking this might be a cool hole-in-the wall option.  It's stuck in a semi-sketchy strip mall, and the restaurant is very small.  About 7-8 small tables and rather dingy.  Nonetheless, it seems to receive good business, given the full tables and steady stream of takeout customers.  As long as the food is good, right?  Well, it's mediocre.  Unlike other Yelp reviews, the staff working was great for us.  Attentive and friendly.  I wish the food equaled the level of service.  Tom Yum soup is a staple of Thai restaurants and one of my go-to choices.  However, it was overly sweet and too tomato-y.  We also had the Pad See-Ew, which was average to slightly below-average.  I will say that the Pad Kee-Mao (spicy noodles) was decent.  They are generous with the spice level, if you are a spicy food-fan.  You can bump it even higher than the usual \"1-5\" if you ask for \"Thai spicy\".  Price is reasonable but comparable to most Thai restaurants.    Overall, the experience here is so-so.  As I mentioned above, there are plenty of Thai restaurants in the Phoenix area.  Since there are others with nicer decor, more seating, better food, and similar prices, you might as well spend your hard-earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Thai House in Mesa came highly recommended to me when I first landed here in Mesa. (The woman who suggested it said she eats there 3 times a week!) She had a copy of the menu, gave me directions, and sent me forward for a culinary treat.  The restaurant is not much to look at. Small, cramped seating. Clean, but not much ambience. But what they lack in the decoration department, they more than make up for in the fresh, clean Thai taste that I love. And, they are extremely friendly, which goes a long way in my book.  I have eaten there twice, and here is what I enjoyed:  Musamun Chicken: Nice pieces of white meat chicken--and a LOT of tasty curry broth. The broth is not thickened--it is soup consistency. Large chunks of cooked onions and very tasty potato chunks cooked to perfection. You can order it as spicy or as mile as you want. I ordered it with level two heat...which was slightly warm to me. Three would burn my mouth, I think.  Green Curry Chicken: Again, nice pieces of white meat chicken. A lot of tastay curry broth-- flavor was slightly sweet and tangy.   Rice was well cooked and fresh.  Both times, I ordered their Mango with Sitcky Rice-- and this is aptly name. You get a large half of a mango, sliced on top of a very large (4\" square) of sticky rice, with a side of the sweet milk sauce. The Mango, both times, was ripe and juicy, and they give more than enough to enjoy with every bite of sticky rice. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!  The staff are all very friendly. On my first visit, when I asked to have my left overs wrapped, they added MORE CHICKEN to the broth so I could enjoy it later. You just don't get that level of generousity everywhere.   Visit this Thai House"}
{"text":"The food is amazing best Thai  food I have ever had. It's a small place but the food makes up for it. Definitely going back!!!"}
{"text":"It's small, easy to miss, and the green curry will BLOW YOUR PANTS OFF!   How the fuck did I miss this place!? In 4 years of living in this area I have driven past and not realized what I was missing.   I'm gonna be straight with you here. I'm pretty broke. Besides being pretty broke I'm also cheap as shit. Finding some tasty Thai eats that cost between $6-$8 a meal is like HALLELUJAH!   If you want fancy ambiance and candlelight go pay $20 a plate. This seemed to function mostly for takeout orders. (Of which there were many pickups in the time it took to eat my meal.) This is pretty bare bones. About 8 tables. But still, it's nice. While I sat there I noticed the woman serving knew many people by name and was relaxed and friendly with everyone. I went back yesterday to try their pineapple curry (also freaking excellent! Get it spicy!) and I was treated so nicely and promptly when picking up my order. This restaurant deserves an award for so kindly providing glorious nourishment which I sat in my car and devoured in a parking lot because I couldn't make it home.   Breakdown: Spartan atmosphere, but clean and pleasant.  Friendly and attentive wait staff. Fucking baller-amazing curry.   The end."}
{"text":"This place would be a 5 star but its a little small and cramped, so no parties or groups bigger than 4. Their food though, so so good! I go at least twice a week for their green curry! Staff is always nice and there's never a wait!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the customer service was horrible. Maybe in Thailand you could treat people this way, but we are in the USA. Would of given a two or one but food was good."}
{"text":"We have tried many Thai restaurants and this is by far the best! Love the Tom Ka Gai soup, Pad Thai, Spicy Noodles, & curry dishes.  We come here at least once a month and have become regulars. The place is small inside and not very fancy but that is a small sacrifice for delicious food. The service is great, very personable and accommodating. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"seating limited and felt crowded otherwise red curry chicken was very good.  highly recommend for take out for home.  plenty of food for the price."}
{"text":"When I get back to Mesa, it's always a must to stop and eat here. The food is fresh and beautifully served. It is the best Thai restaurant I have ever eaten at."}
{"text":"I had read the previous reviews prior to my stopping in. I had read about the rude staff. I thought perhaps they were having an off day. I wanted to find a good Thai place in Mesa. I thought I could overlook it and give it a chance. Walked in, Wow the place is small. That's fine. The girl sitting behind the counter get's up and has an annoyed look upon her face, sit anywhere she says in a snide manner. OK- I think, this must be what the other reviewers are talking about. My friend and I sit down.  Another couple is in the place. The server goes over to get their glasses for drink refills, something is said and I hear the server say sorry. As she walks to the soda fountain I see her roll her eyes. Game over. I say to my friend, let's go. I will never be back. For me the dining out experience includes the service. I will not pay for rude service no matter how good the food. The thing that gets me is that most of these joints are family owned and operated. This may not be the case with this place - I do not know. If it is, this woman's life must be pretty miserable!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Thai House, and love it is so close to my home.  The food here is quality thai food, and really full of flavor.  My favorite entree is the yellow curry dish with chicken, and a second runner up is the mussman curry with chicken.  The service is quick, and the staff is very friendly.  The place is pretty small, and since so close to our home, we order for pick-up."}
{"text":"Use to be my favorite Thai restaurant but have noticed that the quality has gone down dramatically over the last year. Had lunch here on Friday and this was the first time that I did not finish my meal or take the leftovers home. Had Pad tai. Very strong fish oil taste and chicken was tasteless. Overall the restaurant felt dirty and tables stick to the touch. Original owners were great. Not sure what's up with current crew."}
{"text":"My daughter and I popped in for lunch and wanted to try something new so we ordered the  Tom Ka Gai soup which had a nice long black hair in it, both my daughter and I are light haired. After bringing it to our servers attention I got no apology just a swift removal from the table. We will not return."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I love Thai food and I had tried a couple other Thai places that were nearer to where my wife works just for convenience but they did not even compare.  The pad Thai is perfect, the Panang is the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The flat spicy noodles are great! Everything I have ever tried here is on point. The Thai tea is the perfect complement. And the sticky rice pudding for desert rocks! I recommend this place to anyone and everyone"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I have only been here for lunch.  I have had a few things here and they are all good. But every time I come in now, I tend to gravitate towards the Panang Chicken Lunch special. The curry here is real tasty. Served over steamed rice - just delicious. And it is made fresh. On a scale of 1-5, I always order the 5. Maybe next time I will order 8! I like it rather hot.  They also have this tea there. It is out of this world. Anyway, go here. It is great food. There aren't many tables, like 5 or so. But you can't go wrong with the food."}
{"text":"I've had this place about 2 times and was about to have it a third time tonight and they were some what busy when I got there. Here's my story..I ordered a pick up order over the phone and they said about 15 minutes so I waited and then left to go get my food. When I got there and I told them I have an order to pick up they asked my name and then said that my order hasn't been made because of all the modifications. I was going to share with my mother that has an egg allergy and doesn't like tofu so I asked if they could put the egg and tofu on the side when I ordered on the phone and they said yes so when I get here and they said they haven't made it because it's to hard and they can ask the cook if he wants to make it and I'm thinking wants to? I'm paying for this and it's his job. So then I say I'll look at the menu and try and find something else so I look and the lady comes back up to me and says you can wait till he's done with the orders in here and we can see if he can make it. That was were I just left. I ordered 20 minutes ago by now and then they wanted me to wait even longer for the possibility that it would get made. That extremely horrible guest service. The other times I went there it wasn't the best but it was about a year ago and I thought to try it again and something different. I will never go back and give them money and support there business. I went to wok in which is on main and power and they took my order and they had a full house. I've never had an issue at wok in and they are so friendly. Support wok in not Thai house!"}
{"text":"The meat here tastes nasty-so nasty I had to send it back.  I tried a curry chicken dish and the beef with eggplant.  The curry was good if it was without the chicken. When I sent it back the lady got so mad and started yelling in her language =/  I felt so weird.  What horrible customer service!  And then she said to me, \"that is the last eggplant today-NO MORE.\" I was like oooookaaayyy whatever that meant lol  I would never ever come back.  The restaurant looks dirty and there is no health grade rating posted anywhere (and we all know why).  I wonder what they are trying to hide.  Anyways, do yourself a favor and go to Thai Chili."}
{"text":"Excellent food, large portions and good value for money! The flavors their food far surpasses many Thai food places in the valley. Food is very fresh as well!"}
{"text":"This place was horrible. We are Thai food lovers and we have been to the Thai house in Scottsdale several times and had a wonderful experience. When we walked in, it was hot and stuffy and smelled of old fish. We ordered tom yum soup and glass noodle soup. The tom yum did not have any lemongrass, kefir leaves or basil- it tasted like frozen shrimp in a fish broth. The rice noodle soup tasted exactly like Lipton cup-o-soup with green onions added to it to give it that extra boost of flavor. We got our food to go and threw it in the garbage can outside of the full release massage parlor next door. Quickest waste of 30.00 ever!"}
{"text":"Not so good...  I have been here 4 times.  I was new to the area and this was the only Thai restaurant I knew about.  I was disappointed every time, but had to give them a chance to redeem themselves, they never did.    The experience starts by being wedged into a table.  This is the worst dining area I have ever seen.  They have 3 tables, if there is more than 3 parties, you wait or get take out.  The dining floor is 2.5x larger than a pizza hut pick up restaraunt.  The only time I ordered their chicken Satay's they were bland, luke warm and greasy.  Half of them were pink and raw in the middle.  I was scared I would get salmonella.  I sent them back and after that I received nothing but dirty looks and attitude from the waitress / manager (there was only one person taking all the orders and managing the front).  As numerous people have said, customer service is a low priority.  They are not friendly and can be very rude.    The food was boring and dissapointing.  I've tried several curries, chicken and beef dishes.  There are so many great Thai restaurants in Arizona, there is no need to settle for this.  Look up some of the better restaurants.  I'm not sure how they have such high ratingings, but trust me, there are far better thai restaurants out there.  Go to Swan Thai, Tum Nak Thai if your in the area.  Avoid this dump at all cost."}
{"text":"This place is stuck between a sketchy massage place & a head shop so it wasn't hard to decide on thai food considering my other option was either a bong or a rub n tug! Asked for 7 heatwise and it was probably a 3... Food was barely average and they serve no Singha or beer of any flavor"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for many years. Best Thai food in the valley.  I lived in Thailand many years ago, and love the food at Thai House.  Very Authentic!!! I never go anywhere else.  Small restaurant, but I usually order to go."}
{"text":"My most favorite Thai restaurant!!!  I've tried many of their dishes and my favorite is their Pad See Ew with tofu (and no egg), and their Pad Thai (with no egg). Their curries are also really good too! The dining area is tiny, cozy, a great place to take someone on a date. My Mum and I like to go here when we have bad days and eat our feelings away hehe. Thai House is wayyyy out of our way and there are at least 4 other (substandard) Thai restaurants within 10 minutes of our house, but we are always wiling to go the extra mile to eat here!  They usually have really good specials too. This place is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Now THat is how you cook Panang Curry. The owner gets five stars for hospitality; her inviting personality made me feel the comfort of being in her own home. The spring rolls with peanut sauce were delectable. She moderated the sweetness of Thai tea just to my liking. Then the Panang curry came out and - it's like they scientifically know how to make tastebuds leap for joy. People were coming in all the time for pickup orders. This place is very popular, very prompt, and the owner rides with her customers' preferences."}
{"text":"Is it so hard for a waitress to just smile? Is it so hard for a waitress to say thank you? Rude miserable service. My tofu vegetables were swimming in a gross sweet sauce, too many onions and red peppers, my salad had a gross sweet dressing. This was just a disappointment all around."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Very consistent and I am a sucker for the Satay, green curry chicken and the pad Thai is smookin hot. The place is not fancy And only seats about 12-15. They have a huge takeout business. I have never been disappointed. They know you by name and always know I am a diet pepsi guy and bring out the satay to start. I dont have to even ask.   Give it a try your gonna get hooked. Average plate is about 7-9 bucks"}
{"text":"Last meal good. Enough said! But seriously I hate even outing this place because it's small and not always easy to get a table but I have to. Never had anything that wasn't ridiculously good here!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food! Owner is very friendly. The place is really small, not meant for big groups more for takeouts. What the place lacks in space makes up for huge in flavor. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is super small; hidden next to smoke shop and Asian massage parlor.  There are 5 tables squished together in \"dining room\" (if you can even call it that) adjacent to a 3 stool bar top.   It was a but confusing walking in and trying Yo figure out where to pick up my to go order or where to sit even while waiting, but the owner (I think) asked my name and said I was early, but they quickly make the food for me.   I ordered Pad Thai, which was very good. A little too liquidity for me, but good. I also ordered Clear Noodle Soup... this wasn't the typical clear noodle soup I'm use to at Thai restaurants,  but the broth was good. Something in it I didn't care for, but I could put my finger on it.   Would I order again here, maybe?!? There is just so many Asian restaurants to try in this area and so little time."}
{"text":"Solid Thai restaurant with good prices. The inside is a little wonky and beat up and could use some improvement but it's definitely par for the course with most restaurants of this type. Definitely worth stopping in. LIMITED seating though."}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai food in Arizona! We use to come here all the time when we lived closer, but the food is so incredible we still make the trip from Gilbert! Spring rolls are to die for and so is the Panang! I hate to sound like a tourist because that's all anyone ever orders but the Pad Thai is the best around!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Thai Hose house for years and have never had a bad meal.This place has only 5 tables so you might have a wait if you don't get there early.The egg rolls are small but very tasty. My wife had the chow mien with tofu. The egg noddles are very tasty and  the dish has  plenty of mixed vegetables. I had  a mixed  vegetable dish with chicken and a garlic sauce that makes the dish extremely delicious.The service is good and friendly. This is a great place for the money. Thai House is a must go to place if you like Thai food ."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's tiny and jam packed with lots of people enjoying really good authentic Thai food. The owner is really sweet and always delivers quick and delectable service. I highly recommend this place.  The Penang is out of this world.  It's a hole in the wall but a real gem!"}
{"text":"Great food!!!! The dinning room is cozy! Always a nice place to grab food on the way home."}
{"text":"Negative stars.  This place is FILTHY in Mesa.  Disgusting.  I ordered pad thai and it looked like noodles with hot hot sauce on them.  The salad was bitter, the pass thai had a horrible flavor-  I was very polite and said it didn't taste right to me, it RUINED my appetite and I didn't want anything else.  They REFUSED to take it off the bill (I ate one tiny bite) because \"other people like it\".  I called back to complain, the owner said she was too busy.  I NEVER send food back- this was inedible and I still can't get that taste out of my mouth an hour later.  Beware of this place, and hope you never have to use the restroom.  Most disgusting restaurant I've visited in awhile."}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant.  Its my favorite place to go for date night with hubs.  The food is so flavorful and seemingly fresh.  Service is always quick, and if not friendly, certainly not rude in any way.   My favorite things to order are the Spicy Eggplant and the Pra Ram, together.  You get a savory and spicy eggplant dish and a slightly sweet and spicy peanut sauce dish and the combo is excellent. (its not served as a combo, but my husband will order one, and I the other and we share.)  We get out of this restaurant filled, happy, and wallets still full.  Dinner for 2 is easily done for under $25 bucks, even with a 20% tip!  The only drawback to this restaurant is that we could never take a large party there.  This tiny little restaurant only seats about a dozen maybe a dozen and a half people. but they offer take out!"}
{"text":"Tiny place with great food. We placed our order for pick up and it was ready when we got there - 10 minutes later. Green curry was amazing. My friend had Pad Thai. It was very good."}
{"text":"This seems to be more of a Chinese restaurant than a Thai place.  Kung Pao, Orange Chicken, Chow Mein and Pepper Steak are more Chinese fare.  Teriyaki is Japanese.  But they do have a good selection of Thai curries and some noodle dishes.  Not a bad place, the food was ok.  They do ask whether you want the food in a variety of spicy settings, which I like a lot.  Its not too expensive, I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Place is ridiculously small...they would really benefit from an expansion. That said, the food is so awesome it doesn't matter.  Personal favorites - Green Papaya Salad, Larb, Spicy Eggplant, and the Tom Yum Soup. But everything I've ever had there is top notch. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very small restaurant but they do a big take out business. The food is very well prepared compared to other Thai restaurants. The pad thai, yellow curry with chicken and green papaya salad were delicious.We eat at Thai restaurants often in many different cities. The Thai House in Mesa Az is in the top tier"}
{"text":"Never been disappointed. The Pad Thai is delicious and the Thai tea is so good. It's very small and often there is a long wait, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I've tried 99% of the Thai restaurants in the entire East Valley and this is by far one of my absolute favorite places to grab a meal, regardless of cuisine!  Thai House is just a great, consistent, cozy eatery with decent prices and all around excellent food.  All the other \"Thai\" food joints in town should take a cue from the quality Thai House serves up on a daily basis (except Sundays, which I found out the hard way).    Prices average $7-$9 per plate and there is a very good selection of genuine Thai dishes on the menu, as well as many of the traditional favorites most American urbanites have come to expect.  Lunch specials are reasonable and include slightly reduced portions of regular entree items with salad/soup and rice for around $7.    There is usually just one person serving, sometimes two, but service flows right along and, while it's not \"fine dining\", the atmosphere is comfortable, the staff is attentive and food arrives quickly.    The restaurant is very small inside and seating is very limited, so I recommend large parties (more than 4-6) consider getting their food \"to go\".  There is no outside seating any longer, but they are prompt with takeout orders, so, even if you can't eat in, you can still experience the great taste and value at home!  I've lived in Asia, traveled to Thailand/Myanmar and grown up in a busy part of Southern California where authentic Thai food was practically \"on tap\" every other block.  Finding decent \"Thai\" food in Phoenix has been a daunting task to say the least, but I'm glad Thai House sticks around, as I always find myself going back.  If you're ever near the Superstition Springs Mall in Mesa, be sure to make this your meal-time stop!  Thai House is located at the North-East corner of Power Rd. and Southern Ave., next to the \"Pier 1\" store.  Your wallet AND your tastebuds will thank me!"}
{"text":"No thanks... Thought I'd check out this place today. As you walk in you'll notice the place is extremely small inside, limited seating. Well, I was going to order pickup anyhow and get back to the office. First lady yells over in a stern voice, you know what you want?! I said no could I have a menu? (Seems as I interrupted her day or something, no smile) So.. no real warm fuzzies when you come into this place. Okay.. well we'll move on. I order the chicken chow mien. As I sit there waiting for it another lady comes out and she's much older, now this chick really looks like she need a happy meal.  I ask her if I can get a small drink while I wait. I go with the Tai Tea and I just ask, does that have caffeine in it? She looks at me like I'm wasting her time and says all tea have caffeine. (yes tea no teas). Anyhow, I'm thinking.. wow these people are just having a shitting day or all of the women are on the same cycle today. So.... I\"m checking the place out. It's crammed, it cluttered, there is crap stacked on crap behind the front counter, I see through a fridge with bags and drinks in it that looks like my break room fridge at work. Anyhow, I get my food... it's average at the best. Chicken seems like it was frozen then microwaved as it's rubbery and the noodles are pretty much what I could make on a drunken college night. So.. yeah... no I'm not a fan... enjoy."}
{"text":"We've been there before and found the food very good.  But we haven't been there for several months.  Went there tonight, saw a cockroach on the table closest to the kitchen. Turned around & left.  Maybe we'll try them again in 6 months, maybe not.  There's a lot of Thai restaurants closer to us."}
{"text":"yum yum yum!  Walking in this place I noticed that it is a little hole in the wall so I thought this could either be really good or really bad.  I tried curry for the first time today at this place so I was a little nervous but it was delicious!!  I ordered the one that starts with an M (I'm not even going to try to spell it.)  My daughter ordered the orange chicken and it was the best we have ever had.  My dad had the chicken teryaki which he did not love and my mom had a salad called larg I think which was not my favorite either.  But I think we were just not used to the flavors.  I am still giving this place 5 stars because of the orange chicken and the curry."}
{"text":"A small family owned place. Not a whole lot of place to sit down (just a few tables) but seems like they do a lot of takeaway. The food was good and portions were pretty good for the price. If you like Thai good, check it out."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  The food is amazing and they also will do requests!  My friend lived in Thailand for quite some time and fell in love with a certain dish they didn't have on the menu, but they made it for her anyway!  They are always very nice and considerate, even though they are always swamped! The restaurant itself is TINY so I always just order for pick up, but you HAVE to try the Thai Tea - it's awesome.  I'm slowly working my way through the entire menu and haven't been disappointed with anything yet!   Also, I have some family members that are incredibly psychotic about the cleanliness of restaurants - and this place passes muster!  They are clean and tidy!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is tiny!  That's okay because the food has BIG flavor!  (is that too trite?  oh well, it's how I really feel!)  I got the Panang Curry with beef, possibly my favorite food.  It definitely measured up to any other that I've had.  I wish it was served with more vegetables than just bell pepper, such as string beans and whatever else I've had it with (zucchini, most notably, but that was a substitution that I made, and isn't traditionally served with it, although zucchini should be served with everything.)  It had just the right amount of kick, was creamy and flavorful and the meat was tender and savory.    I'd definitely recommend, though not for a sit-down meal."}
{"text":"If youre not into  \"well loved\" atmosphere this small place will put you off as run down. However if you love hole in the wall places with excellent food, put Thai House into your secret stache of great places.  Had the spicy eggplant with shrimp which was excellent."}
{"text":"Cheap thai food next to a shady massage parlor? check.. Small restaurant with tables from the 1980's? check  Pad thai, medium spicy ($7) - as good as it comes. I've never had bad pad thai so I'm assuming it's really had to mess up. I loved the beef pad thai, loved the price, and the food comes out within 5-8 minutes. Everything is extremely prompt and the service was friendly.   Fresh spring rolls are also a good try.. comes with shrimp and veggies and an awesome sauce.  ($5)  This place doesn't have much seating, so it can fill up quickly and you can end up waiting for awhile, so it's always a good idea to have a back up plan."}
{"text":"The food is good but the inside looked dirty to me. With a little bit of cleaning with some new decor & paint the place could look super cute."}
{"text":"Be careful of how you order, because they'll tell you that you're being charged for dinner portions if you don't specifically say \"lunch special\", because items are on both.  Otherwise, food is pretty good, not as authentic as Tum Nak Thai. They have some seating although it's not great for groups. I was not terribly impressed given the reputation."}
{"text":"When fiance and i walked in...we looked at each other in shock at how tiny this place was. \"No big,\" i said.... \"this could be one of those amazing spots...i mean people look like they are enjoying their meals.\" i was way off. Very disappointing. Table was dirty. Server let us sit for almost 10 minutes before giving us a menu. Then took my order and walked away without my fiance's order. Weird. I ordered soup and it wasn't good. It was bad. Lunch meals were decent. Bathroom is gross which indicates to me their kitchen may not be any different. I wish I had visited the bathroom BEFORE I ordered (while waiting for FOREVER) because after seeing the water beetle and who-knows-what-insect in the god-forsaken disgusting hole-of-a-bathroom...I would have left FAST. IM SERIOUS!! Look at my other reviews of other restaurants...you will see that I am always honest."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. It sits in a distressed strip mall between a tattoo parlor, a marijuana shop, a massage place. You may wonder why 5 stars. It's the FOOD that makes it so good. We ordered larb, eggplant, orange chicken, and a curry dish. Plus white rice. I am picky with my Thai food and believe me this is right up there with the best.   My 5 star rating is to acknowledge the fact a restaurant does not to have to be hoity toity (ie expensive) to excel in their quest for darned good Thai food."}
{"text":"Red curry and thai iced tea are like my constant go to's...seriously good plus I do take out and it's enough for two heaping meals so really its $5.00 a meal!!! Highly recommend! The staff are so sweet too."}
{"text":"If you love Thai food, this tiny little restaurant is amazing! I've been coming here for years and have never had a bad dish."}
{"text":"This was the first Thai restaurant I tried in Mesa. It was delish. I love their Thai iced tea, and of course, their Pad Thai with fried tofu. Their dinner portion is not as big as Tum Nak Thai, but nonetheless, very satisfying.  Thai House is also pretty generous in their tofu portions and the Pad Thai is less oily but the flavor is still great. I think it's also free to have a mix of chicken and tofu - but I've never tried to do that here."}
{"text":"Great food, great service!!  The owner always asks about my kids and is always pleasant. Rare. I can hop the wall behind my house and hop back in a couple minutes."}
{"text":"Best thai in town! #38, with a cup of #9 and a thai tea. Perfection. Small and cozy with great service."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times. Love that it's right around the corner from my house. Food is great. We've tried the pad Thai, orange chicken, and the garlic pepper beef. Also had egg rolls and the pot stickers/fried wonton. Can't complain about any of it. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall with yummy pineapple curry! The spicy level is high. I got 3 out of 5 and it made me sweat!! The bathroom was super hot and stinky with rotten lemons sitting in a cup. The waitress was a bit stingy with the lemons, with I did not appreciate. I did not enjoy the crowded environment, but the food was worth it."}
{"text":"This was the most disgusting place I have eaten at in a long long time.  First, while we were eating dinner a mouse ran across the floor into the kitchen.  Second, we ordered a tofu dish and there was a bite out of a piece of tofu (no, probably not the mouse!), Third, the place is FILTHY - check out the bathrooms.   I was with a date so didn't want to draw attention to the dirt and filth in this place.  I am contacting the health department before anyone gets really sick."}
{"text":"As promised here is my updated review of Thai House after trying both the Thai Tea and Fried Rice. Verdict is.. this place is legit. Walked in on a less crowded hour of the day didn't feel as cramped and the food came out fast. Ordered the Thai tea which I didn't like at first but it eventually grew on me and I'm even craving it as I'm writing this review. The fried rice was fantastic. Just the right amount of moisture to the rice, flavor, and tenderness of the beef. Made it very hard to put my spoon down after it was all said and done. Basically, come here if you crave fried rice and Thai tea."}
{"text":"Blah. A friend of mine just moved to Mesa and we decided to try Thai House because a) it's close to his house and b) it got a rave review on Yelp. Well, it was not great.   We started out with the fried wontons (standard fried wontons with like 1/16th of a teaspoon of spiced ground chicken filling) and spring rolls, which were actually quite good despite the extreme stickiness of the wrappers. What really worried us, though, is that the appetizers came out about 30 seconds after we ordered them, which led us to worry that they'd been sitting around; I'm not always against pre-making food, but this place isn't busy enough to ensure rapid cycling.   For dinner, my friend ordered the red curry with chicken and I ordered the pineapple curry, which was red curry with (canned) pineapple and shrimp. Sure, we should have branched out but were just both feeling the red curry. The spiciness scale goes from 1-5 - I got a 2 and my dining companion got a 5 - I'm a total spiciness wuss and was happy with my 2, but my heat-loving friend wanted the 5 to be hotter. The curries were just okay. And maybe I'm just spoiled on Thai Basil's amazing curries, but I didn't find either curry to be all that impressive.  Furthermore, the place is SUPER tiny, which is fine, but the layout means that you're practically sitting in the laps of patrons at neighboring tables. Not fun.  So this place was fine, but nothing special. 3 stars. It's possible that the red curry just isn't that great and everything else is dynamite, but since the previous 5-star review said that the red curry was the best thing on the menu, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We went there and although the eating area is really small, the service is top notch. We ordered our food, and I couldn't believe how fast they brought it out. I was worried it wouldn't be hot and fresh but it was right off the stove. They let you choose spicyness of 1-5. I had the 3 and it was great. My wife went for the 2 and it was a little too spicy for her, but I thought it was pretty mild. Overall, outstanding service, speedy food, and delicious. Love it."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant! They have the best pad kee mao (spicy noodles)! Crave their noodles all the time."}
{"text":"Great Food and Awesome Prices!  We found this place after buying a new Honda down the road where our sales person told us that this was a great Thai restaurant. We decided to give it a try based on his glowing recommendation. We were not disappointed at all!  To start off the prices are very good so this is a place you could eat in every day for lunch or come in regularly to dine and it doesn't break the bank as much as some places.  The staff was very friendly and made sure we had water and liked their food. Everything was great with that!  The food was really tasty! I was very happy to find another Thai restaurant that has authentic and delicious food!  As for the dining area, it's definitely a bit small, but it works out well and considering what a good deal the meals are here it's worth having a little bit tighter surroundings!  Stop by and have yourself a delicious snack and you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Best orange chicken ever and great curry. the staff is really nice, the food is authentic. If you can get past the look, it really is a gem. Their prices reflect large portions- definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food! Amazing flavors! One of our go to places, have tried quite a few other places that were just average..so we were super happy to find this place!"}
{"text":"Love love this Thai restaurant. Little hole in the wall with about 20 seats inside! If you can't stay, the take out is always amazing!!  They do get quite busy, even during lunch time. It's just a little gem in hiding!  Their pad Thai is great if you aren't too adventurous with your Thai food. Their yellow curry is also a go to for me!!! After writing this review, how I HAVE to go get it for lunch!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's small, so if you live close by it's probably best to order carry out because after 6pm it gets busy. Everything I have tried is really good. Pad Thai, the Green Curry, the Pineapple Curry, Pineapple Fried Rice are all excellent. They ask you what level of spiciness you want (1-5) or if you really like spicy food you can even go higher than 5 if you ask. I ordered a 7 and it definitely was spicy. I've been here three times and each time I've loved it! They are friendly and food comes out quickly. 10/10 in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Thai House, what an amazing place!  We were a pretty large group for this small place, if I counted correctly, max occupancy was 23 or 24, and we were a party of 6  1/2, and the front end lady told us to wait and she will group some tables to together for us. Oh let's not forget its Valentines Night so its lil busier than a normal Thursday night.   We waited for maybe 15 mins, and for me that's a normal wait at some other places.  Once everyone was seated we ordered our drinks, I ordered Thai Tea & Ice Tea, my son who has never had Thai Tea just looked at my drink when I got it and I asked him if  wanted to try it and he did, and never gave it back haha, had to order me another one!  Ordered some fried wontons that were filled with ground chicken and they came with this amazing sweet & sour sauce, can't describe it, but it's nothing like anything I have had before, very delish for sure!   For the main dish, I went with the Massamun curry with coconut milk, potatoes, onions and peanuts, and I ordered it at level 5 hot, I say bring on the heat!  But for me, the level 5 was good, it had presence of being hot, but it wasn't overwhelming, if they had a level 10, I'm sure that's what I would be going for. But for some at our table level 1 was a bit too much, so don't judge me by heat factor; I just love things that are hot! Loved the Massamun curry !  I also thought ahead and knew that I had nothing to pack for lunch for Friday, so I ordered some Pad Thai noodles, level 5 as well. Let me tell you, even the day after, those noodles were amazing!! So good!   The front end lady was amazing, yes it was a small place, and there was  a bigger party seated after us, but never once did we fell rushed and she was always keeping on top of refilling cups and just making sure our table was happy. Excellent Service for sure!  Look forward to going back to Thai House, even told her that next time, Ill be back in a smaller group haha."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Totally love it!!! Everything is so good the service is great! I would take any of my friends here!"}
{"text":"The Thai dishes may be fine, but we had the worst \"stir-fried\" chicken dish ever, called Ginger Delight...the meat was tough and tasteless, except for the leftover flavor, like it'd been pre-cooked, pulled out of the frig and tossed into the wok. The server at least admitted that it is BOILED before stir frying! (And apparently refrigerated before using.) Horrors! The Orange Chicken that we'd read raves about was just as tough, hard, and tasteless, most likely pre-boiled also, and the sauce was a congealed blob under the meat, way too much cornstarch and little if any orange flavor. Even giant all-you-can-eat Chinese buffets serve fresher tasting food.  Never again, and never believe rave reviews for this one!"}
{"text":"Thought this would be similar to Thai House in Scottsdale that I enjoyed several times. It's NOT. My panang curry- ordered Thai hot- is a bland unspicy mess. Hardly any veggies other than a few strands of red bell pepper. Barely edible, but I choked it down since I was hungry and having to pay for it. Never again."}
{"text":"Chicken pad Thai. Best in the east valley. I could eat it everyday. Glad I live right around the corner!!!!"}
{"text":"Small thai restaurant with literally 5 tables and a little bar area where 3-4 people can sit max. I really enjoyed this place even though there was a line to get seated during a busy lunch house rush. Even if you had to wait, it is usually not that long b/c the service is quite prompt even with just one server (she works hard).   As for food, I've tried the pannag curry and the spring rolls. Personally, the spring rolls were not the best I have had. I do like the peanut sauce though. The curry was def my favorite here as it had the right spices and flavors.."}
{"text":"STILL MY FAVORITE THAI RESTAURANT!!!   I have yet to find a decent Thai restaurant in Jacksonville, and had to come back to Arizona to get good Thai food.   I was sooooo happy with my meal tonight. And the prices are so cheap!   The curry noodles, masaman beef, pineapple rice, and panang curry... all amazing! We have so much left over we will be eating for two days.   The only small complaint is that this location is very small."}
{"text":"Excellent yellow curry with chicken and the Thai fried rice was delicious. A friend said she thought the place was a little dirty but I didn't see anything bad and if it was I didn't care because the food was so good. Huge portions. It is a small place, only a few tables, but that's the nice part. Great service. Next time I'll get the Thai tea. It looked great."}
{"text":"This is a quaint place in a strip mall off Power Rd. The owner and who I presume is her daughter are very nice and remember me each time. However, I don't always feel that they are super attentive if there are other dine-in patrons when I'm picking up take-out.  I'm not a fan of the pad Thai, as I find theirs kind of wet and slimy. I LOVE, however, the panang. I do shrimp and tofu. Both are amazing. I don't love tail-on shrimp, but the flavor is great. The mango sticky rice is fantastic as well (when it's in season)."}
{"text":"I've eaten at 4 Thai places within the last month, and this is by far the best Thai food.  Quick service, great presentation, flavor is great. Owner is friendly and helpful. Glad this place is here."}
{"text":"I've always been sort of impressed about the speed I which my food was prepared. It was always a plus for pick-up.   Today marks the end of my visits to this restaurant. Mild Food Poisoning has that type of impact. Unfortunately, the food is prepared too fast and some sort of cross-contamination occurred.   For those of you who know food poisoning intimately....you've been warned."}
{"text":"I love this little Thai restaurant.  The food is good and the people always friendly.  Designed more for carry out rather than sit down. Some of my favorite dishes are the panang chicken, spring roles, pad Thai, Tom Ka Gai soup, pineapple fried rice & pra-ram.  The food is prepared quickly and fresh, a great place to pick up dinner from, after a long day at work."}
{"text":"Well I don't often write bad reviews and was a little surprised given the good reviews. Simply put, my family and I didn't like the food. I ordered 3 dishes to get a good feel of the food and wasn't impressed with any of it. The orange chicken tasted like it was make with ketchup and chili sauce or mcdees BBQ, the chow mein was so so but tasted burned, almost like the pan wasn't cleaned properly. Lastly I had the pad se ew and really for me this was the only edible dish I had,but still wasn't great. Definitely hope things turn around for this place."}
{"text":"Usually when deciding on a first time visit to an eatery, especially to an ethnic cuisine, regardless of its status and published reviews, one hopes for the best, and expects the worst!  The anxiety was totally unwarranted for our first visit to the Thai House.  This very unassuming little restaurant in typical suburbia packs a positive wallop in all things culinary.  Whether you're into Thai food or not, overall the place is nicely appointed, clean, comfortable and the service was better than could ever be expected.  This little gem generally hits the spot, but they've taken to heart A focus on few very good, as opposed to many OK dishes.  These folks are to be commended for their offerings, manner and hospitality with which they approach and serve each patron!"}
{"text":"Thai food for me is one of the world's greatest cuisines.  Too often though it's pretty blah.  This place is by far the most authentic and best tasting place I've found here.  If you take away the ac, the front wall, parking, and general cleaniness, you could be sitting on a soi in Bangkok having dinner (and sweating).  Try some things you are unfamiliar with, you won't be sorry and heck the prices are 20% lower than other places."}
{"text":"It's a wonderful cozy restaurant with a nice owner. If you have a large party, it is difficult to fit, but if you're looking to hang out with close friends or go on a date, the atmosphere is perfect. If you do have a large party, they offer timely and excellent take-out to accommodate all customers' needs."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! I've visited this place often and loved the food but then I find hair in my food...that's disgusting and I would think the least they could do is give me a refund or at least a free meal! The woman I spoke with on the phone was very rude and actually laughed at me because she told me to bring the food back after I had already told her I had thrown it away...of course it's in the garbage there was hairs in it! I wouldn't recommend this place it's dirty and apparently they don't care about their customers"}
{"text":"This is an awesome Thai place in the far reaches of Mesa/Superstition Springs. It's very small and tends to be pretty busy. We often get panang curry with beef and pad thai, both of which are great. The fresh rolls/summer rolls are a little small, but quite fresh, and the house noodles (noodles in broth) were quite good as well. There's plenty of meat and plenty of sauce in their bowl of curry. This last time, they had run out of Thai tea and I wasn't especially impressed with the pad see ewe, and the spiciness levels seemed a bit inconsistent. But, again, generally the food is delicious, portions are generous, and prices are nice. They have the cheapest Thai tea I've seen around."}
{"text":"The food is always great here. It's my go to place for Thai food in the valley. I tried almost all of them and this one has the most flavorful food of any of them. It's a bit of a hole in the wall but I kind of love that charm. It's relatively inexpensive. But the food is always awesome. I love the Panang curry and the Tom Yum Ga soup."}
{"text":"Food is always good but last week they seem to have skimped on the shrimp in the spring rolls. Very disappointed as we have been customers for years."}
{"text":"My husband and I experienced the worst customer service ever received at the Thai House Restaurant in Mesa and is not worthy of a full star.  The Open sign was lit at 8:35 giving us the indication that the restaurant was still open for business before their 9:00 pm close.  When my husband and I walked in and sat down at a table.  We were rudely asked to leave sighting that the restaurant was closed and yet the open sign is/was as bright as can be.    I read somewhere that restaurants can not turn away business before closing and communicated this to the owners of the restaurant   Regardless if this is fact or not, we should have not been treated disrespectfully and wanted to document our customer experience or lack there of."}
{"text":"I honestly never write reviews but figured it's time. My husband and I eat here almost weekly and it is the only restaurant I consistently crave. It's is hands down the best Thai food in Arizona. We don't even eat Thai anywhere else because it's a waste. Our very favorite dishes are musemun curry (not sure the spelling on that), curry noodles, pad Thai, and orange chicken. It's a tiny hole in the wall with minimal seating but the food is damn good and we will forever be Thai house regulars!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai restaurant's EVER!! I wish they had more seating because they're always busy. The food is wonderful! The staff are all super friendly. I've had most of the menu at this point and everything has been great!"}
{"text":"I love thai, happened upon this place, this SMALL place, I figured maybe its 1 of those small well kept secrets (cuz i was originally not going to eat there for lack of seating) So I finally get a seat, order water w/lemon, waitress is busy talking to people who came in.. brought me a coke?! And still not paying any attn to me as I could not even say \"thats not what I ordered\" because she was STILL talking to the ppl who had just come in, so she leaves & when she finally comes back I have her exchange my drink for what i actually ordered. The food & portion were average, when she took my appetizer plate away she took my fork, so I had to wait AGAIN until she came back, while I sat there looking at my dinner I couldn't eat. OH YA and when i went to use the restroom, the tiny hallway was packed with a cart of dirty dishes & clutter. the smallness, dirty crampiness, and lack of good service would lead me to never going to this place again, I mean if u only have 4 tables how can u NOT get things right?!?!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town. People are very friendly too. I always get the Chow Mein with some wontons or the satay. Occasionally I will mix it up with the panang curry.  Food comes out very quick as well. They do have limited seating, however the serve food quickly so its not too much of an issue. I will be back many times I am sure."}
{"text":"I love their red curry.  They will make it as hot as you want.  Jus a small place,  but that's pretty common for thai places.  The owner is a very nice lady also."}
{"text":"I love pra ram so I base my review mainly on that :P  My first visit to the Thai House was with 3 other friends this past weekend.  This is a small place with maybe 5 tables which seat 4 each. The service was just OK when we went on a Saturday evening. Waited a long time between sitting/ordering/food/check. Also I was a little upset that they charged me $1.50 extra for ordering brown rice. I mean, seriously? I could buy a whole bag of it for that price.  Everyone's food was good, but I have to say that I like the Pra ram at Tum Nak Thai on Power and Baseline better."}
{"text":"So after craving sticky mango rice for 2 days, I finally give in to my struggle. I go to the restaurant to order and they are out of Mangos in the middle of the afternoon on a Saturday!!! How could this be??!!! This should never be an issue for a Thai restaurant...especially on a Saturday. No apology, no rain check and no mention of when they would possibly be in. To me, that's poor customer service. I'm never coming back again."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since 2006. Although the food is still excellent, the customer service has severely waned. Jamie (the owner) was always super friendly and knew ALL of her regulars by name. She is still the owner, but no longer managing this location as she has opened additional restaurants in Scottsdale and Phoenix. Customer service is prompt and efficient, just not friendly. If it weren't for the quality of the food, we would probably choose another place."}
{"text":"Lunch special $5.99 can't beat it! Small dining room but great food and excellent service. Pad Thai was top notch"}
{"text":"Very small restaurant, however, the food is great.  The owner is a sweetie.  Highly recommend you go.  My date and I took a bottle of wine, they don't have a liquor license, and we had quite a lovely meal.  Will certainly visit again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"hmm. decent thai food. kinda expensive for a hole in the wall.  their pad-ke-mow is pretty good. might be called something else... spicy noodles?  still looking for that thai place that actually has a menu with thai script and with at least 50 items on their menu.   this place will do for now."}
{"text":"This is my go to Thai restaurant. It's very small inside, but we've never had a problem getting a table. The menu has a lot of variety. The food is really amazing. The prices are great and you get really large portions. There is no way you can eat it all in one sitting so you will have leftovers. The leftovers are great too. We have dined in and gotten take out and the service is always wonderful. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants great Thai food."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of the good old hot dog and hamburger, but this Saturday I was feeling adventurous enough to dip into the cultural scene for a bite to eat. Picking straws in my head as to where I was going, I remembered a friend of mine that lived in Thailand telling me of a dish called Pad Thai that sums up all the flavors and ingredients of their food into one experience. I guess you could say I was feeling a little spicy!     Whipping out my \"precious\" iPhone I search for some Thai. Southern and Power popped up first and I was on my way. Tucked away along the string of businesses I found the Thai House with the brightest and biggest signage of them all right above the entry. Instantly I had a feeling of a Tijuana or Las Vegas late night joint on the strip. Opening the door I get a sweet greeting from a girl working two of four occupied tables in the bathroom sized dining area. I barely had time to take in the scent of coconut milk and ginger billowing out of the kitchen before the server is at my table. I ordered the Pad Thai and was asked what hot level I wanted for my sauce (this is kind of cool I'm thinking) in terms of one to five, so I said six. She laughed and suggestively asked if I wanted the chai tea with that (as if it were a natural combo), and I agreed.    There is not much to look at or do other than concentrate as hard as possible not to follow the conversation of the couple next to me who I now know are are planning on getting their first apartment together soon and are both compelled to remind each other of their love as often as possible . Combined with the constant nudging from one of the lovebirds elbows every time he forks anything on the left hemisphere of his plate, the setting is rugged and tight. This is coming from someone who has only been to maybe two dozen restaurants other than Denny's or Ihop and usually I steer clear of anything not Franchised. Just two minutes passed and already I am presented a bowl of fresh steamed rice and pair of chopsticks. Now we are talking! This was In fact, some delicious regular white rice just like In America. After just a few bites of my authentic Thai rice she brought out a mound of noodles and steam on a giant plate along with my large beer-looking Thai tea.    Taking a second to visually inspect what is sitting in front of me, it looks like some spicy chicken noodle with some crushed peanuts and peanut sauce on the side. The tea Is unusual because it is thick with a carrot tint and a froth to it. Deciding to mix it before I drink it blends into a more mild tone and I take my first sip. The initial taste is sweet, hint of vanilla and a rich thick consistency, almost like a sugared orange glass of milk. My Pad Thai looked worse than it actually tasted; the heap of red tinted slop and crunchy sprinkles was in reality some good spicy chicken noodle and crushed peanuts with a hot factor compared to some Taco bell hot sauce. I was hoping that I was about to experience the hottest food I have ever tried but instead I just got a uniquely blended sweet and sour fun to eat plate of chicken noodle. I must say that the Thai tea was a great spicy support drink because it seemed to extinguish the flame in my mouth the second it washed over.    Overall I had a good time. The food was pretty good and was exactly what it was supposed to be. Service was above average and the prices were just right."}
{"text":"This is a small hole in the wall with fast service, good food, and excellent prices. They have a variety of lunch specials for around $5.95 that come with rice and a salad or soup. I love their eggplant dish and their pad see ew. They even have thai tea for $2. The place is small though so  get ready for that."}
{"text":"As my roomies put it:  \"Finally a Thai place in Mesa that I actually like.\"  \"This tastes like my Mom's Thai restaurant in Utah.\"  Three of my roomies and I ordered the Panang Curry with Beef, Red Curry with Chicken, Tom Yum Koong, Spicy Chicken and 4 Thai Iced Teas. The curry was the right consistency, not watered down and too thick. And the best part was that it was just deeelish! What is great about this place is that the spices don't overpower the dish, and you can taste many different flavors with each bite.  This little place seats under 16 people max. It's a definite mom and pops store that makes tasty and very reasonable priced meals. We chatted how we wish we hit this place up sooner because its one of the best tasting ones in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"So far this has been the best Thai food place I have eaten at in Arizona. I ordered the Pad Thai, and to be honest, that was one of the best that I ever had. Everything I tasted that evening was good!   This place is SMALL!!! But do not let that stop you. Go in and try it out....."}
{"text":"Easily the best Thai food in Arizona. The dining room is small and the bar is short but the service is prompt and the curries are fantastic. This place is a family favorite and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Great value lunch.  Best egg drop and veggie soup on the side.  Pad Thai at 3 spice had some heat on it."}
{"text":"Luv, luv this place. I am a huge thai food fanatic and have tried several establishments in the area. In my opinion for the cost, quantity, quality and service this place is outstanding. It is very small and tends to run out of tables especially around lunch time, but that has never stopped me from revisiting. If you like Thai food you will not be disappointed.."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. The food is great even if the space is small you will feel comfortable and the lady that owns it is so friendly. We always get the ice tea. Highly recommended place."}
{"text":"OMG Best green curry ever.  Its a small place but really good food. Friendly service and my go to place for Thai food.  I suggest the papaya salad and pad thai as well."}
{"text":"Went here for the last 3 weeks. The lunch special deal is amazing and you can't beat it. $5.99 gets you a soup or salad , 1 entree and 1 side of white or fried rice. You will leave stuffed!  The only thing is that this place is extremely tiny , seats about 15 people but the food flies out of the kitchen so there's always a rotation of  customers coming in and out."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by our cars salesman.  Good job Paul.  Authentic Thai food, lots of flavor, and affordable prices. Mostly everything on the menu is under $10 .  We ordered the curry noodles and orange chicken.   Both meals were under $20   Definitely will come back here when we are on this side of town."}
{"text":"Ok so honestly this place looks a little dumpy, but the food makes up for it.  I wouldn't even call it a restaurant because it's so tiny, but take a chance and try to get a seat or just order take out.  My husband likes the curry there, I'm very plain Jane, just fried rice or pad thai, and both are very tasty.  No booze at this place if that's important with your meal."}
{"text":"The food (lunch) was decent. I would eat it again if it was the only Thai around. I was told I couldn't eat there because they were closing in \"10\" minuets when my looked my watch it was 20 minuets. It annoyed me because other people were eating in thee. Soda machine not working. Thai ice tea was delicious. Overall... it was fine I just feel annoyed with the experience."}
{"text":"When we walked in a woman was expressing frustration with an older very polite gentlemen due to their lack of good communication. She had an accent and he was hard of hearing. She was practically yelling and it is an unbelievable small \"restaurant\". The floors were dirty and the fridge was stocked with food as well as uncovered glasses of ice water for customers (some people wouldn't mind that, but I found it odd.) While waiting for our food the same loud woman told a long story to another employee in another language that must have been exciting because her voice very enthusiastically projected throughout the tiny dining room. The employee she was talking to was the one who actually served our table (the woman put on make up in the dining room the rest of our time there) and he was a very nice young man. The egg drop soup was not very good and oddly thick. Pad Thai's sauce and noodles were okay, but the chicken didn't taste good. It tasted like it either sat in the fridge too long before being cooked or was reheated from the fridge. This place would be okay if you're looking for inexpensive and fast take out, but I will never eat in the restaurant again."}
{"text":"I have tried 3 or 4 dishes there and none impressed me. Their pad Thai is okay... One of those restaurants that I would eat at if I craved Thai and there was nothing else nearby."}
{"text":"Ahhhh! Finally some real thai food!  I've been searching for a decent thai place since I moved to AZ and this is it! All the dishes are real quite good. I actually brought my Thai friend there who is picky about his Thai food and even he said the food was good and pretty authentic! The portions are really big and the food is inexpensive. Service isn't always the best but honestly, I'm there for the food! :D   if you are ever in the area, definitely give Thai House a try."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty, served hot and good,  Smaller restaurant, so it may be hard for larger groups.   No listed vegetarian menu, but many options for people following a vegetarian diet."}
{"text":"So the last 6 times I have been here it's been back to AWESOME.  Cheap eats, friendly service, wheat-free soy-sauce, soy-milk, and most of all, AMAZING noodle dishes.  Perhaps someone read my reviews?  Thanks for stepping it up, Thai House, and fixing the obvious consistency issues."}
{"text":"Yelpers save the day again! Driving back from the Apache Trail, vegetarian husband and I were in search of a place near Val Vista and 60 to meet a friend for dinner. We resisted her repeated suggestions to go to Pita Jungle and instead found this place on Yelp. It is a teeny place in a strip mall next to a smoke shop and a sketchy looking Asian massage parlor, and we were the only people there, but it was excellent! The food was fresh and delicious. We heeded the heat warnings though, in retrospect, could have easily ratcheted up our numbers. (My three was barely spicy at all and my husband was sad he didn't go for a five.) Service was quick and friendly and they didn't mind us lingering and chatting until close.  Would totally come here again."}
{"text":"I like it very much. If the curry can have more coconut favor it should taste much better. Will definitely come back soon"}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai place in the east valley.  Wish we lived closer so we could visit more often. Great place to eat family style. It gets busy during dinner time and not many seats but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Used to really dig the food at the Thai House (6 years ago), but they've gone downhill over the years. During our last visit, they \"forgot\" to put a few key ingredients into my Tom Kha soup... like the lemongrass and ginger. WTH?! I caught it, and the server seemed surprised that I caught it. Yeah, I cook, and I know the difference between sub-par Thai and authentic, even though I'm a white girl.  The rest of our visit left us feeling like they could have cared less if we were there or not. (Yeah, I'll call you out, but I'll laugh about it and move on too!)  I might give them another try sometime... but I wouldn't hold my breath."}
{"text":"On April 28. 2017, my wife and I decided we wanted some Thai style food.  We know many Thai restaurants in Mesa, but the one that appears to be serving the best quality Thai food is Thai House Restaurant in Mesa.    I ordered the Pad Thai with Shrimp.  My wife ordered some other noodle stir fried dish that I can not quite remember the name of.  The food was good.  Though my wife found the pad thai to be a little sweet.    If you are going to this restaurant looking for atmosphere, you are going to be disappointed.  It is not a fancy place.  The quality of the food is good, but do not go expecting a fancy interior and dining area.  Not a problem for my wife and I.  This is part of the reason that the cost is low.  The quality of the food more then makes up for the atmosphere.    This is about all that I have to say.  It is a place to go for a quick bite to eat.  It is not a place you go to impress a date."}
{"text":"This is our favorite little hole in the wall. Don't let that freak you out because the food is good, the service is good, and the price is excellent.  There are 4 4-person tables, 1 2-person table, and 4 seats at the bar (no alcohol, sorry). It's almost always full and the tables are packed in tight, so be prepared to overhear private conversations at the tables near you.  Despite the hole-ish nature, the food is always good. We love the curries and the Pad Thai, which happily, is not overly sweet the way some Thai places make Pad Thai. The Mango on Sticky Rice is awesome.  You get a lot of food for a small price. My husband and I like to share an $8 curry dish and we usually take a small leftover amount home with us. Granted, we're smaller-than-average eaters, but the servings seem to be twice as large as the curry dish served at another thai place just down the street. And that other curry place charges more for their smaller portions.  For vegans and vegetarians: You can get tofu on any dish instead of meat. Be sure to tell them you don't want fish sauce. They put it in everything. It won't take away from the flavor if you request this. There is still plenty of goodness in the food sans fish sauce."}
{"text":"I have to upgrade this place to a five star because after having a few other places since we moved, the flavors here are excellent and the prices can't be beat. I haven't had everything on the menu but everything I have had beats or matches all the rest."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  It's so light and simple!!  Try #14 or #37.  I'm not a big fan of curry but this was amazing!"}
{"text":"So happy to have found Thai House. We just moved to the valley from Chicago and we had a really great Thai place back home. The Pad See Ew was amazing! Great portion size too. Highly recommend and will definitely be back"}
{"text":"It is a small place and on busy nights do takeout. Great food for sure.  I have not tried a dish that wasn't good. Their food is prepared with care. We eat here often and always take extra home."}
{"text":"Thai House is one of my favorite Thai places ever. Their Panang curry is second to none, and is the reason why I fell in love with Kaffir lime leaves as a seasoning. The Pad Thai, which is of course the standard dish by which to judge any Thai restaurant, is just right; not too sweet, not too salty, not too fishy. The chicken satay is always moist and creamy,  and the soups are delicious too. It's always a tossup between the creamy tom kha and the hot and sour shrimp soup.    Now, I'm not saying Thai House is perfect. We've been coming here since they first opened years ago, and have watched their service consistently improve. Service is now friendly and fast, which several years ago it was not. It can still be a little spotty - for example, on our last visit, the server forgot our beverages until well after the entrees arrived - but it is always earnest. And spicy food lovers, beware: on their scale of 1-5, I always order a 6, and usually it comes out about a 2. (Of course they have a chili paste you can add at the table, but I find it too acidic; it changes the flavor of the dish too much.)   It can get a little tight in their small space, but it's well worth it for the food. And at these prices (less than $8 for a large dinner portion of the curries), Thai House will continue to get my business for many years to come."}
