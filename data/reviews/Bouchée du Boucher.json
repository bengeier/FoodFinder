{"text":"Saw this on mtl blog...trying their take out sandwiches to meet up with friends and nosh and chat..."}
{"text":"This is a brand new place and it is a must go. All the sandwich are made in the spot when you order. All ingredients are fresh and so very tasty. The place easy to find also very close to the highway for easy access. They have parking also available.
It is new and recently open, very hip and clean.
All sandwich come alone or you can enjoy it in a trio with soup du jour, salad of the day or homemade chips. The homemade chips are amazing and very tasty. Today I had a cucumber and feta salad with my sandwich and I love it. This place is a gem and once you try it all you will be able to do is go back to try all the other sandwich. Staff is friendly so stop by to say hi and have a bit to eat you wont regret it"}
{"text":"Great little place for fresh sandwich that is NOT made with processed balogna!! The meat for the sandwiches come from the butcher shop INSIDE THE RESTAURANT!!!, I don't think it's possible to get better quality or fresher meat. 

Everything here is homemade, BBQ sauce, hot sauce, french fries, bread, meat. 

2 people with sandwiches and fries and drinks was only $19, so its a pretty good value, and the visa machine did NOT auto ask for a tip. I hate this trend and am grateful for businesses who set up their machine this way.

Thank you for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Before heading to the 'Centre de La Nature' which is located close-by, we decided to stop by The Butcher's Bite to pick-up some sandwiches to take with us. I went with their porchetta sandwich with some type of green aioli sauce as well as the caprese sandwich. On the side we also took their potato chip fries with sriracha sauce. The sandwiches are made on the spot and are as fresh as they get. I was disappointed the cucumber feta wasn't available, I love that dish. Oh well!

The sandwiches were good but nothing I felt that would make me want to come back for. A few of the porchetta slices were very fatty and I disliked picking them out of my mouth. All in all, the sandwiches were 3 stars for me. The potato chip fries however were totally 5 stars. They were quite tasty and salty and they came in a generous portion.

The price-tag is a big steep but you're paying for fresh sandwiches at a gourmet sandwich place. I may come again and try something else but I'll make sure to get those fries again!"}
