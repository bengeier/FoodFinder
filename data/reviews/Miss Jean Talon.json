{"text":"I've heard a lot of complaints about their pizza so I never really got to try it. So when I order from there, I tend to lean for the subs. Usually I get the steak and  pepperoni sub with fries and I'm never dissapointed! The sub is always delicious and they really fill the bun with ingredients. Compared to other locations, their subs are fuller. Their fries and onion rings are also very good.   Delivery takes long sometimes depending on your location (if far, it can be an hour)"}
{"text":"I've been craving so much junk food this week but I was too lazy to get out the house. I ended up searching for local restaurants that delivered where I lived and found this one.   I ordered poutine and a sundae with it and was relieved to hear my doorbell ring exactly 36 minutes later. Bonus for their punctuality! Then I tasted my poutine, and damn, was it good (especially while watching a movie).  All was good, except that the second time I ordered something (fettucini carbonara), the meal was a bit too thick. Other than that, my experience was pretty much good!"}
{"text":"Great pizza loved it 3 decades ago and still great pizza today...when in the neighborhood always stop for a great Greek pizza"}
{"text":"Remember back in the 70s when pizza tasted amazing outstanding and delicious!   Well this is that place! The smell of the fresh dough perfumes the place as you blast back to that era where your feet doesn't touch the floor and the heat from the pizza oven warm your cold bones on a winter after noon ..    After a session with my  Love &  Cheech and Chong we found ourselves drooling over the menu realizing that a few hours had passed and 13 glasses of water... we were finally ready to order   Now I hate to brag, but i am self proclaimed an aficionado of burgers and i will say that Miss Jean Talon makes the best Hands Down Burger All of Quebec ... And if anybody wants to prove that their burgers are better ..Just send me an invite to your location and if you can even come close to making a burger that is as juicy, delicious, soft and tasty that can stimulate every emotion in your body to feel total ecstasy and enlightenment... then I give you that crown until then Miss Jean Talon  Makes The best Hands Down Burger All of Quebec   The pizza as well was delicious, mind you i couldn't get much since my love was hunched over it with knife and fork and I've learned after a few stabbings not to reach in her plate when great food is in her area.  as she quoted ummm  amazing , ohh so good .. yumm , don't touch . leave it alone oh my god .. yess yess  ohhh godd yesss .. i need a smoke ... that was delicious .... we got to come back here again !      The service is incredible but to my astonishment they ran out of grape juice! Small miss hap but i'm bot going to flip out on that ...   One of the cleanest places in the area and refreshing to see a diner with a big tv NOT PLAYING SPORTS {thank you}   As for the wash rooms 1 000 001% cleaner than that guy you find creepy you work with. .  if your lost in Park EX of Montreal and not in the mood to rent some curry food then Miss Jean Talon is a great escape ...   And I was serious about the burger Invite"}
{"text":"I love miss jean talon which is on the corner of wiseman and jean talon (hence miss jean talon) they have renovated the joint about 5 years ago but there menu stays the same, AMAZING!!! My all time favorite is the pizza!! Small miss jean talon special for 10.95$. It's a must have for all you pizza lovers out there"}
{"text":"We were in the area, and hungry, so based on the reviews from Risa and Hoang we checked this place out.  Fairly limited choice of toppings so we got a cheese pizza with pineapple on it. Sixteen dollars for a single topping pizza, and nearly two dollars for a can of pop make this one of the most overpriced places I've ever been.  The pizza was delicious, though a little under done. The crust was gorgeous, but there wasn't enough sauce.  All in all, a decent pizza, but definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"It's not the worst pie around (see my review of Double Pizza for that) but there are far better slices to be had for even less money. We've only done delivery so this won't speak of the establishment itself. We've used their site to order combos twice. In both cases, an extra large pizza, all-dressed (their version of the works) and the pepperoni and cheese. In both cases, the combos come with fries and 4 cans of soda. The fried are made from frozen and basically inedible. On both occasions, the pizzas went uneaten and thrown out. The crust isn't thin or thick, it's somewhere in between and very chewy. The sauce is weak and boring, the toppings paper thin and very sparse.   One of the best parts of delivery pizza is having a slice the next day. In this case, the cheese hardens to a thick plastic coat that makes it impossible to eat.  We won't be ordering from Miss Jean Talon again. With Little Italy in the same neighborhood, there are plenty of much better options."}
{"text":"Vers 10h, j'ai regardé ce que je pouvais commander à proximité sur Just Eat. Malgré que Miss Jean-Talon soit à 5 km de moi, c'est lui qui sort en premier. J'avais une envie de roteux et poutine. J'ai donc commandé un trio hot-dog. Vu que la note minime est de 1*, je rajoute la 2e étoile à la madame qui a pris ma commande. Super gentille, elle a bien compris ma commande, bref un amour.  J'ai donc reçu ma commande 1h plus tard. Le jeune livreur parlait au téléphone quand il a sonné. Il a raccroché et m'a dit le prix. À peine un regard dans la face rien. Sa tête sur le cell...mais vu que c'est bientôt Noël et j'ai bon coeur, je lui ai quand même laissé un gros 3$.  Alors j'ouvre le sac...le tout est tiède bien sûre.  J'ai cru manger  une bonne poutine avec le nombre de sauce et de fromage fondu qu'il y avait dessus, mais non. Les patates étaient tièdes un peu dur et goûtait les vieilles patates  .tsé quand tu les réchauffes genre 2 fois au micro-onde. Alors, j'ai mangé ouvert les hot-Dog qui venait dans un papier blanc. 2 hot-dog steamé malheureusement écrasé au maximum. Malgré l'écrasement, il y avait beaucoup de choux au dessus..j'ai cru que ça allait être bon...tsé des hot-dogs c'est toff d\"être raté, mais non, la saucisse était toute ratatiné et avait exactement le goût des saucisses aux poulet sans nom (ouai je m'y connais en saucisse hot-god cheap). Bref, un 18$ au total tip inclus dépensé pour avoir manger de la mal bouffe dégueulasse. Il me reste le 3/4 de la poutine. Désolé je n'ai pas pris de photos...et c'est tant mieux ainsi. Bref, je ne commanderai plus là... Désolé Miss JT."}
{"text":"Great \"old-school\" greasy spoon pizza.  We had a little trouble finding the place due to the name on the sign being totally hidden amongst the other signage describing the food held within, I was not disappointed by the quality of the pizza we ordered.  We ordered a pineapple cheese pizza. The crust was crispy on the outside and bottom, but soft and chewy on the inside, the cheese was gooey and plentiful, and the sauce was flavorful. The pizza was also \"juicy\", which I love, but is not always to everyone's taste.   What I found disappointing was that the pineapple was clearly from a can. Even frozen pineapple is head and shoulders above canned when fresh is not a viable option and the price was exorbitant. $16 for a relatively small \"medium\" pizza (12-13 inch I think)."}
{"text":"Local pizza place that isn't too used to getting travelers. They were extremely accommodating to us by seating us at a table that would be even more comfortable than the one we chose. Also our waitress was attentive and was concerned with making sure our visit was a good one. The menu is quite large with a basic selection of pizzas and all kinds of other quebec dishes. Their poutin is pretty darn good and the small was a good snack size for even four people. We had the Miss Jean Talon special and it was delicious. The dough is fluffy and the crust is crispy. Only complaint would be that the ice cream here is all frozen yogurt, so the large dessert menu may not please you as much. Everything was cheap, a XL pizza $23, root beer floats $2.75, banana split $4.95, and small poutin $6."}
{"text":"This is back to beloved diner status in my mind, based on a recent visit where I got to experience the full on Miss Jean Talon, not just the glimpse you get from delivery. Big booths, cheap glasses of beer, awesome friendly madame service, all day basic yummy breakfast so you can eat yer eggs in the afternoon while your friends eat a sub and a delicious personal sized pizza. I would totally go back here to eat diner food and drink all day, and if this sounds like joy to you too we should probably be friends."}
{"text":"Ordered on uber eats. Food was good , we got the sandwiches but after a while we felt really bad and had stomach aches."}
{"text":"This is an amendment to the other reviews already posted. I concur with the other 3 Miss JT lovers but wanted to add that I recently went there on a greasy cheap diner breakfast mission and at 11:30am they had already stopped serving breakfast!!!   No more all day breakfasts...at least during the week. A bit of a disappointment as for $4.95 you can't go wrong and the booths/waitresses are the real McCoy.   Definitely will continue to pop in for late night pizza but will have to seek lazy breakfast elsewhere."}
{"text":"A Park-Ex institution run by Greek holdouts who refuse to cede their neighborhood to the YUPPIE Invaders.   Food is great. Service is aight (don't expect 5 star quality at the MJT, when your in \"the Extension\" sit down, shut up and remember where you are) and they have soft serve ice cream.   I would rather eat here than any of the Indian joints. Although I love Indian people and Indian music (hey im not racist Ravi Shankar is a boss!) I find Indian food way too spicy and I dont like sauces or flavor so the MJT is perfect for me because they have no problem holding the sauces and making me dry tomato-less clubs even if they find it a little odd.   Dolly the owner is a nice lady and the bathrooms are sparkly clean.  Long live old Parc-Ex! May the Miss JeanTalon live on forever!"}
{"text":"Je suis allé Vendredi. Le boss payait la pizza et dans le coin, des pizzerias, il y en à beaucoup, donc certaines plutôt mauvaise. J'ai pris une commande pour apporté un Large All-Dressed. Ça m'a vraiment satisfait. Je sais que nous n'avons pas tous les mêmes goûts mais moi, j'aime la pizza avec \" du stock\". C'est-à-dire, bien garnis avec beaucoup de fromage! C'est une pizzeria grecque qui à l'air d'avoir du vécu. Typique des années 80's avec des banquettes et les vieux de la vieille du coin qui viennent depuis toujours.   Maintenant la pizza était vraiment excellente et dans mes cordes!"}
{"text":"I had not been here in years. I remember that their pizza was amazing. And guess what.....its still amazing. Just like the good ole days when I lived in the neighborhood."}
