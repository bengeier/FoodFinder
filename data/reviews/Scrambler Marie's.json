{"text":"Terrible..my hamburger was tasteless.  The eggs scrambled.  Omg  dried out.  Whos cooking there food.  Never go there again"}
{"text":"Went back a second time to Scrambler and feel better about it, although the service is a bit slow.  The waitress we had this time was much more attentive and we got things a bit quicker.  I may go back, but it's not a place that I feel that I need to go back to immediately."}
{"text":"This location just recently opened in a strip mall near our house. We're always in search of great breakfast options, and unfortunately this is NOT one of them.  We went this (Saturday) morning around 7am. The place was deserted, except for a couple and one single diner. I ordered the Classic (eggs, bacon, potatoes, pancakes- no butter), my husband the American (eggs, bacon, hash browns, toast - no butter), and an extra plate for our picky 2 year old. Food came and the bacon was undercooked, mine had huge strips of white unrendered fat on them (gross!), my husbands over medium eggs had one popped yolk, and one undercooked with slimy egg whites (double gross!), the hash browns were dripping in grease, and both items requested without butter came with it.   The hostess, who brought our food, informed us that the waitress had buttered the toast and was making another, and the pancakes were on their way. No extra plate. Waited about 4 minutes for the pancakes (brought again by hostess), and had to ask again for a plate for my kiddo. Toast comes a couple of minutes later, and we tell the waitress the problems with our meal. She says she'll discuss it with her manager, because at this point I've eaten all my eggs, my kid is done, and I don't want to wait for them to refire half the meal. Waitress comes back after 10 minutes in the back, never sent a manager to see us, and drops off our check, which has been discounted $3 for our troubles. Overall, very poor service and food. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Would give 4.5 stars if I could.   Based on reviews they had some issues to iron out after December 2014 open.   They must have worked things out. Good food and service.    Hashbrowns cooked to order is a nice touch."}
{"text":"It was average.....nothing to brag about. I would go back if I didn't feel like making breakfast and Bob Evans wait is too long!Lol!"}
{"text":"Food is not very good. As easy as it is to make breakfast, somehow they have not figured it out. ( and this is a place that supposedly specializes in breakfast ) Service was okay and I got seated  quickly. That's why they're getting two stars. If it wasn't for my nice waitress, they would've got zero stars."}
{"text":"Good food, I had the spinich mushroom omelette which was excellent. One less star because of noise which was loud. Radio speaker was next to our booth and much too loud, but was eventually turned down. Place was clean and service was pretty good. Kind of surprised at the negative reviews as our experience was good and we will return."}
{"text":"Had breakfast at this location. I was everything but impressed. I eat out for breakfast on a daily basis and I'm constantly looking for new places. This is not a place I would visit again.  They couldn't manage to get bacon right.. The server brought me another plate of bacon after I told her how chewy the first plate was. They simply dropped some pre cooked bacon in a deep fryer for a minute and brought it out. That is not the way to cook bacon. It's bacon......... It's disgusting when it's pre cooked, refrigerated then cooked again in a deep fryer... Bacon produced a lot of grease on its on. You can't cook it in a deep fryer with oil and expect it to be tasty and have a good texture.  I'm always going to be a fan of locally owned and operated diners. It's the best way to go for breakfast it seems."}
{"text":"Visited on Tuesday morning around 9:30 am.  The restaurant was not crowded at all.  Service was fast, friendly and efficient.  Had a Wild Western omelette and a mini sausage and cheese omelette.  Both were hot, fresh and delicious.  Both were served with hash browns, which were serviceable.  Toast and biscuit served on the side were fine as well.  They are not breaking any new ground here, but it is a nice, clean and relatively inexpensive breakfast spot.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast choices, but I've had a lot better.   My teammates and I met here for lunch today pretty much because of the location. I ordered the western omelet. It was good, but they didn't have the kind of cheese I like--so that sort of ruined it for me. The hashbrowns were actually my favorite part--shredded, perfectly pan fried, awesome. The rye toast was under toasted in my opinion.   I'm doubtful I'd ever try anything here besides breakfast.   The ladies who work here are super-nice. I loved that our server wore her \"proud grandma\" sticker with a smile. She gave us the perfect amount of time between check-ins, sugary sweet!"}
{"text":"Great food with wide variety of selection. Service was good, no complaints from myself or my friends. Clean restaurant."}
{"text":"The ambiance in this restaurant is casual and laid back, which my kids truly appreciate.  So I'm giving them one star for the ambiance.    Our group ordered steak (medium well) and eggs, hamburger and fries, breaskfast sandwich with hash browns, and the chorizo skillet.  Everyonce was happy with the food despite the over cooked steak.  I'm giving them a star for their food because it beats a breakfast at Denny's or IHOP anytime.    The worst thing about this place is the service.  It's very slow!!!  Just to give you an idea, it took more than 15 minutes in order for our drinks to arrive.  The food took over 40 minutes.  The staff that served us was not friendly or warm and did not even apologize for their slowness.  If this place wants to survive they have to train their staff on customer service 101."}
{"text":"Fast service and great food. I was here on a Thursday am. It got quite busy by 9:30. My friend had a scrambler and had them put the potatoes in her scrambler. The cheese in it was good. The cracked wheat toast was delicious. I had two pancakes and couldn't eat but about half of them.The pancakes are a homemade recipe, and they were delicious. I am a pancake snob, so I hope I'm giving good advice.  Also, the syrup came in a container where it was warmed up.my friend and I both would come back here again! The prices were very reasonable, too."}
{"text":"We've been to the new Scrambler Marie's in North Olmsted twice thus far.  The place reminds me of 'First Watch', and it is on the same excellent level as them quality-wise, and price-wise.  SM's is a very nice place to have a real, hearty breakfast (or lunch), the food tastes great, and the portions are huge (the pancakes are the size of a medium sized frisbee!).  The staff is friendly and competent too, and the rest rooms clean (big plus).  The coffee was a bit bitter and 'off tasting' the first time we went, but much smoother tasting and much improved the second time.  Since I go out to breakfast almost every day, I like to 'mix it up' a bit -- one day I go to a bagel joint, the next day Panera's, the next a diner / family restaurant, and at least twice a week, places like First Watch or Scrambler Marie's.  SM is a welcome addition to the North Olmsted community, and a really inviting place to have one's morning grub!  UPDATE February 2015:  We went back recently, and it was the PERFECT breakfast experience!  Their pancakes and omelettes are literally HUGE, so I ordered the 'mini' veggie & cheese omelette (I think made with 2 or 3 eggs instead of 4).  My wife ordered cinnamon raisin pancakes.  Everything was perfect!  And the coffee was amazing!  Smooth, flavorful, and not harsh at all.  They must have 'fine tuned' the coffee to the point where it is ideal now.  The servers are nice and pleasant as well.  Weekdays are not nearly as crowded as on the weekends, where you will often encounter a waiting period.  North Olmsted needed more diner & family restaurant type breakfast places, and now we have a great one!  Way to go Scramber Marie's!  Lastly, the music they were playing was ideal!  Mostly softer, classic rock/pop.... perfect!  We will return many many times."}
