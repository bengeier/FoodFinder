{"text":"This is by far the worst location ever when you make an order for pickup you will find that when you arrive in 20 min that they have not yet started to make your order or the are closed. Also VERY DIRTY"}
{"text":"Being a HUGE Pizzaville fan and recently moved from Aurora to Richmond Hill we ordered in from this location for the first time this week. Now I know restaurants have bad days but unfortunately this experience was my first at this location and as a result I wont be coming back.  I have been a Pizzaville customer for years with the same order every second Friday from the fantastic Aurora location. This experience though, was awful in comparison. The pizza here is more like your typical cheap pizza place (like Little Caesars). My experience with PizzaVille has led me to expect a better quality pizza than most that are out there. Usually you get a somewhat thin and crispy crust with even topping spread and fantastic sauce.  Here is my experience; Started to place my order online as usual and the website crashed when doing so, I was unable to get back on the website so decided to call the location to order. I googled the location and found they had their own website - GREAT :) which gave me their phone number. Since their phone number was plastered all over their site I gave them a call to place my order. Immediately the guy on the line got annoyed with me for calling that number (maybe you should list the ordering phone number on your website) and told me I should have called another number but will make an exception this one time. (I'm sorry, is me giving YOU business a favour you're doing ME somehow?).  Went to pickup the food and the store was quite clean and the guy behind the counter (not who I spoke to on the phone) was quite nice and pleasant. He handed me my pizzas and I was on my way.  When I got home and opened the boxes I was shocked at the carelessness with the way these were built. The pepperoni pizza I got for my daughter had no spread of the toppings and I actually had FOUR slices with no pepperoni and the rest of the slices PILED with pepperoni.  The other pizza for my wife and I had the wrong toppings to start (I despise olives) and somehow ended up with olives. I asked for the pizza well done with extra sauce as usual, but the bottom of the pizza was barely browned and had barely any sauce. Also the topping issue from the previous pizza was the same with this one.  I can go to little caesars to get a pizza slapped together, but at Pizzaville I expect better. I will now be driving every other Friday back to my trusty Aurora locaiton where they seem to really care about the product they serve. I will now be leaving a positive review for them."}
{"text":"Pizza is so good bin going here since I was in Elementary School.. slice and pop was 3.00$ befor now I think it's 4.50$"}
{"text":"Superb pizzas. Fresh and hefty slices. This is probably one of Toronto's best pizza places. Love the friendly service and the very clean place. My favorite is the goat cheese and spinach!"}
{"text":"I was super full even before I ordered this pizza which is why I couldn't give it 5 stars since eating it almost made me explode. Very consistent in quality and taste. Had a little too much minced garlic but didn't effect the pizza too much. Wedges were 10/10 as usual"}
{"text":"Cant be beat ' Way better than the competition in my view. It's the dough and sauce that really matters"}
{"text":"Their phone number is a fax number, they are impossible to contact. Tried placing an order for twenty minutes, no answer."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this location consistently for the past year, and have been nothing but pleased with the quality of food and service from their team. As a fore-ward, I always pick-up my pizza.  Their staff is always friendly, and quick to strike up a small conversation once they recognize you as a regular. From what I know, each Pizzaville is franchise based, so the employees I have interacted with are most likely the owners. Pizza turnover has been very quick in my experience, averaging around 15 minutes from placing an order, to walking through their doors.  The quality of dough and ingredients is well above average, and their selections are very expansive, allowing you to have a large amount of variation in your order. They offer ingredients that you cannot find at other pizzerias, and certain combinations create pies that can deliver a taste unlike other locations.  One massive incentive was the price, when placing online orders. If you select a Large, 3-topping, Pick-Up, it costs $13.55, taxes in. Other franchises are either 4-5 dollars more, or do not match the quality or duration for this type of deal - this is an every day offering, from PIzzaville.  Also, if you place your order online, they allow you to collect digital stamps for each order of $9.99, or more. After you collect 6 stamps, you receive one Large 5-topping pizza.  While this review is extremely favorable, I love my pizza, and have had everything available in the Markham area. I was also loyal to another brand for years, and after a few orders from here, i was hooked, and made the change. I would easily grade this location as a top choice, due to the care the owners take in delivering a product that maintains quality, and treats their customers with a positive attitude.  If you haven't tried them yet, give it a shot, it really doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"First time checking out Pizzaville the chain and this location. I ordered a large Pesto Chicken pizza, Garlic Bread Knots and a Caesar Salad for take away. The person taking my order seemed confused with each item and even asked me about the Garlic Bread Knots as if he didn't know whether they were a real thing - so I had to point to the menu. When I ordered the Caesar salad, he told me it came with bacon and chicken - and I had to correct him that the menu said chicken was extra, and I did not want to pay extra nor did I ask for that.   Waited about 15-20 minutes. When called up, discovered the guy had never input my pizza - so I had waited around 20 minutes for six pieces of garlic bread. A different staff member was apologetic and input the order. I had asked for the Large size, but after another 12-15 minutes, was called up and saw that the box was for a small size. I was tired of waiting at this point so I just took the order and left.   When we opened and inspected the food at home, we discovered the pesto chicken pizza actually contained no pesto or artichoke hearts as advertised. The garlic knots were somehow both burnt on the top and uncooked dough in the middle.   Very disappointing, and doesn't make much sense considering how much competition there is for pizza restaurants. I definitely would not return here."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible! They sent the wrong order to my home 3 times and it still wasn't the right order !!! Then to add insult to injury at that point I had asked for my money back and to simply take the incorrect order back with them and the store owner or manager began to scream and yell at me being insulting, rude, and nasty accusing me of wanting a charity when all I wanted was my money back and for them to take back the unconsumed food. This is probably the worst treatment I have ever had by a restaurant. Oh and to top the awful experience off the driver ripped me off and did not give me enough money back (he was two dollars short of what I had paid originally) however I was willing to forget about it when he rang and rang my door aggressively to tell me that he thought he had given me too much money back and that he was short, he unfortunately was lacking addition skills. And when I showed him that he was in fact two dollars short he decided to tell me that he only makes $8.00/HR Like what the hell is going on with these ppl??? So I am expected to pay this guy a salary? I don't understand? Being single parent and a full time student doesn't allow me to give folks free money unfortunately and especially not for bad food and mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes myself included however typically when one does make an error a correction is required or some sort of action in the correct direction. This was not the case. The whole debacle took approx 3.5 hours.  Much too long for mistaken pizza and giving free money away!  Btw it made me leave a star in reality in would be negative stars."}
{"text":"Order came wrong. And instead of leaving the correct part n letting us pay n bring the new pizza that was wrong store manager said driver had to take it all. And that we had to call head office . We did and it was corrected and all new order was supposed to be rushed as they knew we have kids waiting. ..  only to have head office  call back 20 mins later and tell us  that the store is refusing to send order.  Didn't want to deliver tonight. That we get a full credit which what fucking good is that to us tonight Keep in mind we ordered at 440. Dealing with head office at 540.. they called at 625 to tell us that. Like are u joking my kids are now tired whiny and hungry. Never again will I deal with the store!"}
{"text":"Can't cook a pizza.  Can't deliver a pizza.  Can't process a refund.    Can't believe these jokers are able to keep their franchise.  Terrible customer service befitting the dog food they try to pass as pizza."}
{"text":"Casey, you make the best pizza! Great attitude and respect for the customer! Will come back many times"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years now. I have nothing but good memories of good food.   highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's nice to see all the variety of ingredients one can choose to top their pizza but it can get quite pricy to add the fresh toppings. The doe wasn't  out of this world but I relished every single bite. You be the judge for the price: Two medium pizzas with 4 regular toppings each, total $26.00 including tip and delivery paid over the phone by credit card. I rarely order in but I'll definitely keep this pizza joint in my directory."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the quality of the pizza of late. This used to be much better before but have had some bad experiences the last few times I have ordered here. Ordered the gluten, spinach artichoke pizza and was really done very bad. Not enough toppings, cheese and sauce. Had the same experience when I ordered the chicken provolone pizza the last time. The quality has gone drastically down since the last few months."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly the moment you walk in, most pizza places the staff get pushy because they want to make a sale but at Pizzaville at College & Roxton they are very patient & helpful.   The pizza always tastes fresh, delicious toppings, and a variety of dipping sauces to make you drool. I highly recommend eating here as they have comfortable seating for up to a party of five per table."}
{"text":"Given there is no such thing really as bad pizza, I'm learning that delivery is a critical factor. On both yumminess and quick, friendly, efficient delivery, Pizzaville is one of my faves. There's one or two that top it so I held back one star but a good quality option on any day, rainy or not."}
{"text":"My office had ordered Pizzaville for an office party and I must say that the flavors are amazing. Tried potato, chicken supreme and a hot mexican variety and loved all of them. Other flavors looked tempting too. Will definitely visit the location to try more."}
{"text":"They discontinued extra thick whole wheat crust for Large size. So now if you want extra thick crust they only serve it with the plain dough for Large size. Still tasty but not as healthy as before."}
{"text":"The food is good, but they really need to fix their ordering system. 3 times I've tried ordering using their online system and have my order either screwed up, or sent to the wrong store.   It's really too bad, because I like their pizza, but until they fix their errors and I don't have to check up on it every step of the way, I won't be ordering from them anytime soon."}
{"text":"We ordered from the location on Charolais Blvd in Brampton.  Twice we've ordered and both times something was missing. Both times we've waited for the delivery guy to return with the missing items. To me, the chicken wings are dry but the mild bbq sauce tasted good. Pizzaville is similar to Pizza Hut. I prefer the latter."}
{"text":"Drop-in take away pizza joint with little seating and sometimes thats just what your looking for. Conveniently located next to the 711 so you can pick up Doritos and pop while you wait. Large pizzas are 12 something, staff is really nice, place looks super clean and the pizza is really good. Nothing crazy gourmet over the top, just good thin crust plenty of cheese Friday night pizza."}
{"text":"The telephone service here is horrible, I actually was hung up on three times prior to finishing and receiving my order! I called back to ask them if there was a reason for hanging up, and he replied because our staff had trouble understanding what I wanted.  Honestly? It was my first time ordering Pizzaville, and I wasn't very familiar with their menu, so excuse me! But at least instead of just plainly hanging up, at least mention their difficulty! :( At last, when the pizza arrived, you would expect it to be the greatest to make up for the horrible service, but it was horrible! The pizza tasted so stale, and it was very poorly made! I am definitely never returning to Pizzaville again!"}
{"text":"We finally got a chance to stop in tonight after walking by dozens of times. They've done a great job with the place. Everything seemed impeccably clean, and the staff were very friendly.  After getting our slices and sitting down at a table, the owner came over and gave us a chicken panzarotti on the house. It was quite good.  I was very happy with the pizza. Crispy on the bottom without being dry. Both the cheese and the sauce were perfect, and the crust wasn't cardboard like many other places. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The WORST pizzaville I've ever ordered from. We order from them often,3 out of 5 orders come out wrong! When you call customer service they cannot help you. Pizzaville locations are individually franchised and when the manger was contacted they refused to do anything. In the end it took 2 calls from costumer service + costumer service supervisor to get a replacement. We've never been treated with such disregard!"}
{"text":"We order on-Line most Fridays. Love the thin crust Margarita. Order is always on time and perfectly cooked. Staff are friendly. A great experience."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here and picked up pizza as well from this location and this is the Worst location I have ever been to they are rude they get the order wrong and refused to fix the problem i also ordered a pizza from here and they did not show up when i called head office they said the owner refuses to fix the problem i gave them several chances thinking maybe they had a bad day or whatever but no i have gone several times and all times where absolutely terrible!!"}
{"text":"It makes me hungry just thinking about how good this pizza is especially late night. ;)  Don't come here expecting gourmet or trendy it's not that. This pizza is for the masses.   The dough from Pizzaville has this distinct nougaty taste. I've come here over the years and hadn't been disappointed yet.   Now the location is not much to speak of, it's in neighbourhood plaza in 'sauga but the pizza here was much better than a couple of Pizzaville locations I've been to in Toronto.  Not all franchises deliver the same experience.   Suggest to call or check Pizzaville's website for current specials before ordering. Perhaps you'll get a deal."}
{"text":"I think this Pizzaville location makes outstanding, delivery pizza. The amount of ingredients is perfectly balanced; every bite a meld of all the toppings to savour until the next. The staff are genial; the shop, immaculate.   I feel out of sorts if a week has passed without greeting my fave cook, or picking up a pie, that I do so constantly (sometimes twice in a span of 24 hours!), if anything, for the state of my mental and pizza-craving well-being.   Since this shop's opening, I have stopped making pizza from scratch. The pie satisfies taste, quality (ingredients and evenly-cooked) and consistency (delicious every time).When ordering by phone via Pizzaville's general number, it is worth requesting pick up from this location."}
{"text":"I order most of my pizza here.  Never ever had a problem.  5 star pizza and good delivery.  The price is right to."}
{"text":"Placed an order for two pizzas .  Same toppings.  Reached the store to find out pizza ordrr was on hold.  Called customer service who were unhelpful.  Cause online order was same topping for two pizzas, ordrr wsnt prepared.  Wasting time & effort in order.  Waited another 20 mins & paid for pizza.  Mot good service."}
{"text":"This place used to be the best pizza in Oakeidges with the most amazing staff specially in 2012 and 2013. Right now in summer 2017 under the new afghani-Pakistani management has turn into the worst pizza place. The guy from pizza pizza is working there and makes low quality pizza. Staff look tired and unprofessional and speaking laud. I used to go there 3 times a week but just stopped and switched to pizza nova. This store belongs to company and I'm sorry for pizzaville company that is not able to have professional managers running this store and has no control over the quality."}
{"text":"The absolute best pizza in town, great food and great service. Next time your gonna order pizza give this place try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We've been living in the same neighbourhood for over 20 years and we've tried every pizza delivery service. Pizzaville is hands-down the best. Never greasy with generous amounts of high quality, fresh ingredients.  Delivery is always FAST and the pizza always arrives piping hot.   In all the years we've been ordering from them Pizzaville has only ever gotten our order wrong a couple of times and each time the order has been refilled immediately without any hassle and no return required for the wrong pizza. A bonus for the meat-lovers when the vegetarian pizza accidently ended up with pepperoni.  In store, the staff are always friendly and service is quick. Clean and bright, from the order area to the washrooms."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Pizzaville Pizza!! My favorite Pizza by far, and it must be hard to compete with \"Those Large Pizza Conglomerates.\" I only have one complaint. I wish there were more Pizzaville stores around Willowdale! This store on Lawrence is the closest one to where I live, and it still isn't really that close to me at all. I'd love to see them open a Pizzaville store on Don Mills Road somewhere!"}
{"text":"Have been going here for over 10 years. The current management isn't terrible but can improve in certain areas, specifically honesty. I went there at 11am one time and there were left over slices from the previous night but the franchisee try to play it off like they were fresh. My most recent take-out was an Asiago chicken pizza with extra cheese, instead of putting extra Asiago cheese they used mozzarella instead."}
{"text":"Big thanks to HQ pizzaville for helping me with nightmare.. Pizzaville is a 10 Star operator!! This location is not!  I usually order from my vaughan location. Was at friends place so ordered from here.  Online order \"there at your door 40-50 minutes\" Ordered at 5 Called HQ @6 \"store says food leaving now\" Called HQ @630 \"food already left take 1/2 off\" discount and apology offered right away. Called HQ @645 \"when it gets there tell them its free\" - offered right away Driver at 7PM \"we dont give free. You pay 1/2 or i leave\" was starving gave cash and called head office Explained how food was cold, it only took 2 hours to get there and how driver held my food hostage... HQ advised me that store won't bring me a new hot one and won't deliver to me anymore...  Ended up getting full value of meal and $20 added to my account.. Which i will happily use at my local store....  Best customer service on the phone. Worst people woking at this store. Love my vaughan location"}
{"text":"Had terrible experience yesterday at another location... Doing both stores today.  Pizzaville in general is good. Service is amazing.  This store probably should be a 3.5-4... But the yonge and steeles location the other night was disgusting... So i'm padding my favorite stores stars a bit...  Food always ready on time Delivered on time Always hot fresh an never any complaints about anything from my favorite location"}
{"text":"Decided to spontaneously go here for a custom pizza. I met the owner here last summer, and felt he was part of the community, so I brought my daughter tonight for a visit, because she loves extra cheese pizza. Owner wasn't there, but a pleasant and outgoing blonde girl helped me. I asked if any specials and she mentioned a large one with three toppings at a very reasonable price. Decided on the double cheese and Provolone, and really saucy with extra sauce. Came back 15 min to pick it up, got home, and holy &@$ it was perfect!  Exactly as I ordered, so saucy and cheesy, and so much left over for breakfast and lunch tomorrow. So close to home and so good. Best cheese pizza in Aurora!"}
{"text":"We asked for thin crust and well done. It was thick and raw in the center. The so called dessert was twists or uncooked dough with some sticky stuff on top that had very little flavour. Do you nor care at all? We paid 25 dollars for raw dough. You suck big time."}
{"text":"Sunday football isn't complete without: 1) Beer 2) Chips (Ruffled, bacon flavour or some other \"manly\" flavour) 3) Pizza  So, it's sort of hard to watch television and get yourself to one of Toronto's hipster pizzerias.  Delivery pizza is a very convenient option.  I don't order a lot of pizza for delivery. But I liked the pizza that we ordered from Pizzaville.  We created our order for cheeseburger pizza. It's a pizza... with the toppings of a cheeseburger.  Pizzaville has an easy to use website for you to place your order. It's pretty cheap considering that you get to customize your toppings. They have thin crust as well, if that is what you fancy.  One of the things I really liked is that you have the option of baked wings and two sauces on the side.  They have salad too -- in case you have rabbits watching football with you? I'm kidding, I would have ordered the salad... but I went with wings.  The food arrived on time and it was still piping hot. Can't complain! :)"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place whenever I'm craving pizza. I usually bought a slice during lunchtime since it was across the street from my high school.  The pizzas are delicious with nice, thin crusts. It's not too salty and the amount of tomato sauce is just right. The toppings are fresh and evenly distributed. The prices are fair; $3.50 for a slice and $4.50 if you want a can of pop. They also have sides such as chicken wings, garlic bread, etc.  Overall, it's one of my favourite pizza places. It's a small store so it's mainly takeout, no chairs or tables."}
{"text":"I'm not familiar with any other Pizzaville locations, but if the rest are anything like this one, I'll put them on my list of places to grab a quick and tasty slice.  This location was nice and clean, had a fair amount of seating (including some comfy booths that were all fitted with individual TVs tuned to CP24), and the staff was polite, friendly, and efficient.  I also liked the fact that they had provided a number of newspapers for customers to read. Not my thing, but I noted a few people taking advantage of them.  The pizza itself was tasty, well cooked, and had a good amount of toppings. Keep up the good work guys, I'll be a regular visitor here."}
{"text":"This is my local pizzaville and myself and my room mates order from here all the time. I realise that it is weird to be reviewing a restaurant in a pizza chain but this one will always be my favourite. I have been ordering from them for 3 years at least and not once have they ever messed up my order and they always cook it the way I want it. When I go to pick up my food during the summer the staff are just the best. The love coming out to see my yorkshire terrier and will sometimes give him some pepperoni as a treat! They have even given me a free dip in the past because they love him so much. Out of all the pizza places in Toronto these guys are definitely up there with the best."}
{"text":"Walked in for a slice and no one was at the counter. Waited a few minutes and noticed a worker at a booth on his cell phone. Waited another few moments and asked if I could get any help.  Didn't get acknowledged and walked out without any food"}
{"text":"I know, you're thinking \"this is just another fast-food style pizza joint\" right? Yes, it is. No doubt. I'm going to try to convince you otherwise. BUT, I will tell you that of all the fast-food style pizza places I order from, this particular location of Pizzaville impressed my family and I so much that it has become our go-to pizza take out.   It's really simple. The quality of the food meets our expectations. The ingredients always taste fresh. The pizzas are always topped up nicely. Their online ordering system is fast and easy to use. And we love that we can split the pizza to have different toppings on each half, so while we may be ordering a 3 topping pizza, we can literally choose 6 toppings in total (3 toppings on each half). That's so awesome.   Lastly, the guys there are really cool and laid back people, and most importantly they're courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"they just took over a less then a year ago, and i am very happy with the staff very kind and friendly and do their best to satisfy customers my fav one spinch with feta cheese almost every launch break i have, you cant go wrong with $5 drink and slice :)"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I had a horrible experience from this location.   we ordered a large pizza with 3 toppings on Saturday night and asked for extra mushrooms. we had no problem paying for them.  we were told delivery would take 40 minutes so we anticipated a good cooked pizza.   what we got: a soggy centre, undercooked and my toppings were falling off before the slice could even get to my plate, I was so irritated as I was so hungry. at 11pm, a pizza being delivered in 40 minutes, the LEAST I'd expect is a cooked meal. I couldn't even eat two slices.  what upset me Even more was there was a $3 charge on the bill and when we asked the driver what the additional charge was he had no idea. he said to call head office and take it up with them. and he definitely wasn't nice about it either.   bad service and food = never again from me!"}
{"text":"Ordered a bacon cheeseburger pizza last night thin crust and well done. I had given up on big chain pizza as none could get it right untill this Pizzaville location. Omg this was perfect bang on hands down the best tasting pizza I have had in years. Im hooked I just hope they will be consistent."}
{"text":"everything deserves a chance. came here today to pick up two slices as I was in a rush and was at the dry cleaners and pharmacy.  Got two fresh slices of pizza and the customer service was on point.  happy to of had a pleasant experience this time!"}
{"text":"Pizza was decent--not the best we've ever had, and could have been a bit cheaper. What made this a 1-star review, however, was the service.  You see, we had been here first for lunch, and asked the employee behind the counter if we could organize a birthday lunch here for a group of about 9 kids + 7 adults in a week's time. This place was convenient because it was close to Skyzone (which had a simple menu and couldn't offer one of our guests with a food allergy any gluten-free options). They had gluten-free crust, and hey, what kid doesn't love pizza, right?  On that first visit, the employee said that would be fine, as long as we organized ourselves properly and realized that they couldn't reserve spots for us at the lunchtime hour. No prob. I then asked if we could bring in a birthday cake, and serve it here. She said, \"Sure. Just bring your own knife to cut it, but we can provide you with paper plates and plastic utensils.\"  Fast-forward to the day of our event. After dropping $$ for pizzas and soft drinks for everyone, we got to the cake. My husband then went to the man behind the counter and asked for paper plates. This employee (older man in his 60s) replied that they wouldn't give us any because that's not *their food* we were serving. My husband replied that we had checked with another employee previously, and she had said it was fine. This employee now told my husband, \"I know what you're doing!\" Huh?!? He still refused us plates and utensils. We got some napkins and had to be satisfied with that.  WTH? We did what we were told we would be allowed to do. After buying pizza and drinks for 16 people, we didn't deserve a few cheap paper plates and forks?  Bad service, Pizzaville Laird Avenue! Don't have one employee say one thing, and then another deny it. This had us leaving with a bad taste in our mouth (figuratively).  Never again."}
{"text":"Ordered xtra large for $19very well done, toppings nicely distributed. Enjoyed thoroughly. Garlic dipping sauce best i thought. Perfect for bday party."}
{"text":"Would give this place a 5 star rating because their pizza is absolutely amazing and the daytime worker is so friendly and personable, but unfortunately the nighttime employee is another story...  I have been coming to this pizza villa for years now and I consistently am extremely offended by the way the nighttime pizza maker deals with me, or anyone to be clear. He will see you come in, and completely ignore you for at least 3-5 minutes before he will even acknowledge you. He will be standing in the pizza making area and be well aware you are standing there waiting and not even acknowledge you. Sometimes he will be working, but most times he will be on the phone chatting. As a customer for almost 7 years now I am frankly annoyed at the level of courtesy, especially because the daytime worker is so cheerful happy and eager to welcome and serve you. There are lots of other pizza places around and quite frankly I won't be coming here in the evening anymore. Enough is enough."}
{"text":"After waiting for two hours for my pizza today, I had to call Pizzaville back only to learn that they called me and left. Of course there was no missed call on my phone. Finally barely warm pizza made it to my office - no discount provided or apologies for inconvenience - and best part was the \"garden\" salad that I ordered. It had lots of iceberg lettuce, one tiny piece of carrot and one cherry tomato. For $3.49. Yeah, never again."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Panzo I've had in my life. First the dough was old and kept falling part. Also, I wasn't sure if there was any cheese in there until I reached halfway through it. Even then it felt like I could count how many strings of cheese was poured into it, which wasn't much. I was extremely hungry, but was ultimately extremely disappointed with the small and lacking $8 I spent on this w.e it was. It definitely wasn't a Panzo."}
{"text":"This place is close to home. I stop into here every other week for a slice. The price is fair the pizza is good and the staff is amiable. When I'm too lazy to cook this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I dont normally write reviews but this was by far the worst pizza ive ever had. It started when i ordered a half/half pizza and was given some kind of frankenstein abomination of 2 leftover pizza halfs. When i called customer service i was offered a new pizza which took 2 AND A HALF hours to arrive cold, and tasted like booty (although luckily one pizza). Im more than likely on the verge of food poisoning and potentially my death bed from the one slice i ate."}
{"text":"I placed an oder this evening for a meeting at work, it was late and cold. The driver took my card and asked me how much to tip and I said 10% (it's Company Policy), but he put it $10 and rushed out. SINCE WHEN DO THE DRIVERS USE THE MACHINE THEMSELVES!!   The pizza was only $30, WHY WOULD I BE TIPPING OVER 30% for late, cold Pizza!! I thankfully noticed and found the driver, who claimed he couldn't undo the transaction. He attempted to call someone who wasn't \"available\" and offered to give me cash back. I told him that I needed the receipt to reflect the correct transaction because I needed it for work. He was extremely unhelpful and totally distraught by the situation."}
{"text":"Choosing to eat gluten free pizza is hard because most of it tastes like you're eating the cardboard box the pizza came in. After taking a suggestion from a friend and trying pizzaville's gluten free pizza I don't even want to eat a regular pizza. Their gluten free pizza is actually better then any OG pizza I've ever eaten! I highly recommend topping it with roasted red peppers, sausage, goat cheese, red onions and garlic to put the icing on the bad breath cupcake."}
{"text":"I used to like this place, the pizza was very good. It is going down hill lately. take a look at the picture, this is supposed to be a 5 toppings pizza. Won't go back to order another one."}
{"text":"Pizza was old and stale. Guys behind counter were not interested in making a fresh pizza.  While we were there, there was a lady complaining that not only was her order 45 minutes late, it was wrong - they didn't seem interested in helping her either"}
{"text":"Great service and very good pizza. I ordered a pizza for pick up around dinner time on a Friday night and it only took 15minutes to be ready."}
{"text":"Used to be a 4 star, always good, always right, but tonight was the worst. Pizza showed up delivery with a huge missing section in a party size pizza and oil filling the missing section. We refused to pay driver, and returned all the food, driver said to call main order line to complain and reorder, we did, lady was nice and said she would correct it put us on hold said was ordered and it would be free, sorry for the trouble. Guess what finally arrived and we had to pay, driver talked to branch and said sorry can do nothing. We paid as this time order was correct now 2 hours late, called main order line again, and according to notes on file, the gal we spoke to earlier did not write free order, talked to supervision, got the same thing nothing on file about free, said policy does not allow free orders no matter how much they screw up. Well guess what after many years of our visiting this Pizzaville, NO MORE, we'll find somewhere else to get pizza from."}
{"text":"Ordered from this location recently, and it was a great experience. Customer service was on point, was delivered efficiently, and the pizza was amazing. Perfect for a large group!"}
{"text":"Best \"chain pizza\" around, by far. Excellent crust [especially extra thin], generous, fresh toppings and a very sound tomato sauce.   It never ceases to amaze me how many zombies automatically call Pizza Pizza  or the other grotesque options without a second thought. I call it the \"Tim Hortons Effect\"...they just don't know any better, and if you try to enlighten them, your are often risking physical harm."}
{"text":"I figured I'd support the Raptors because JV was promoting Pizzaville, and since it was the playoffs, I decided to contribute, woah was I ever wrong; so I placed a mobile order of 2 Panzo's and added 8 wings for $5 - Came out to about $20.  I was on my way home so I figured I could place an order quickly using their mobile app, get home in time to just start quarter 1 of Game 4.  So I get there approx. 18 mins after I ordered, (they say should be ready within approx. 20mins).  I walk in and tell them my name; they check and said oh, 8-10 mins, So I just dealt with the wait, but after 10 mins, It still wasn't ready. Eventually it took 40 mins from the time I placed my order til I got my food for pickup.  After being disappointed with the wait time, I just went home - however, after getting home and opening my food, I get more disappointment; I look and found out that 1 of the panzos was burnt and trying to eat the panzo, I could just taste burnt dough with every bite, and the wings I ordered were supposed to be crispy, but they turned out to be soggy and undercooked.  NEVER going to this establishment ever again, Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"It's the sort of place where if you order a half pepperoni, half cheese-only, they may get it wrong and do a full pepperoni, and instead of remaking a new pizza the proper way will remove pepperoni by hand and reheat the whole thing and give it back. Super useful for vegetarians and people whose religion forbids them from eating pork. No apologies, either.   If only the pizza was good. Food 2 stars, service 0."}
{"text":"This place has new owners. The guy cleaned the inside of the oven with the mop he then used to wiped the floor with.  Right in front of me. The same mop that is probably used to clean the washroom.    I saw this after I ordered.  I can overlook a lot of things but...smh"}
{"text":"Living where I do, I have the option of ordering pizza from:  a) Pizza Hut b) Pizzaville c) Pizza Nova d) Pizza Pizza  Let's skip D because their pizza's are just salt and sauce.  Since this is a review of Pizzaville, let's focus on that.  Likes - their thin slice pizza is very good.  You can taste the ingredients when you order any pizza, whether it be pepperoni, margarita,chicken etc and it's not overwhelmingly salty.  They spread the toppings fairly evenly too  Dislike - it's pricey (around the same as Pizza Hut), and their calzones don't come with enough meat. Too much dough.  Verdict: One of my fave pizza chain joints.     Note: place is mostly takeout."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place. The taste is allways great. My fav is the walk in special large double pepperoni extra cheese thin crust... So good! The thin crust is my fav but my wife like the regular crust best...  All in all the best pizza place around!"}
{"text":"I was doing my grocery shopping at the Longo's in Leaside Village and parked my car in front of Pizzaville. Having never been to any of their locations, I decided to check this one out. This location is relatively new and the decor of this place is sleek and clean. Many take out from Pizzaville, but you also have the dine-in option. There are booths with television screens for you to watch CP24 as you eat pizza.  Being in a shopping complex, there's a lot of parking around - always a plus in my books. Service is excellent here - whenever I come in here, the staff are friendly. The pizza is pretty tasty as well; there are always walk-in specials, which make this place quite reasonable.   Good for: pizza, dessert (pizza)"}
{"text":"Pizzaville:  a step up from your regular chain pizza stores.  Just read the 5/5 reviews to tell you what is unique about the dough at Pizzaville.  The problem?  When you're walking from the gym, and only want a slice... (sigh) same problem like any pizza place.  The tomato sauce goes dry, and the once gooey mozzarella cheese solidifies.  It just falls short of the experience you would have when you order a pizza pie.  Please splash some sauce / put a few strings of mozzarella on my pizza... it might make me think of ordering take out from here.  The good news for Pizzaville... pizza is one of the most addictive foods there is. (Oh, the place is clean, friendly service - nothing wrong with the rest of the business)"}
{"text":"Love the Margharita pizza. Friendly service and open late. Delivery can get pricey with tax and delivery charge. I've been getting the walk in special 1-3 times a month and I am very satisfied with the customer service and pizza."}
{"text":"This place was across the road when I was a kid.  I usually only went because of convenience.   I stopped in today and was pleasantly surprised by a little updating in decor and a large update in their recipe.   The slices I had didn't look fresh, but once reheated they were fantastic!     It was the same owner from 20 years ago and he looked a little tired.   I'm glad his restaurant is refreshed though.  Since I have moved back to the area, this might be my go to spot for delivery now.     Nice to see businesses getting a second life."}
{"text":"This rating is for my experience using Pizzaville's online ordering service.   After a horrendous night at the airport, I was craving pizza - not just a slice - a whole pizza for myself, I'm talking fat kid status. So wanting to try a local spot, I searched around, and found Pizzaville with a slightly higher rating thang Geno's so I decided to try them out and boy am I glad that I did.   I ordered their large pizza deal - $14.99 for a large crust, 5 topping pizza with two dipping sauces, and was informed that it would be a 40-50 minute delivery time once the order is confirmed.... Brrr? So me placing the order doesn't mean that it's confirmed? What sorcery???  I frantically checked my email for the email confirming my order, and sighed in relief once I saw it there. 25 minutes later, my pizza was delivered. Quickest delivery time ever!  The pizza itself was extremely tasty. I ate..... no hoovered 4 slices and each slice tasted like heaven. Ever the crust was yummy.   I'm so happy with my pizza and my choice to try this place out. I am definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I ever experienced anywhere!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I walked in and inquired about somethings I wanted to buy. Two guys working the counter and the first guy goes oh \"i don't know\" I look at second guy making pizza \"he mumbles something and goes back to making the pizza\"   So if every single business was like this than how on earth are they still in business. I've been to other Pizzaville locations and you walk in and inquire about anything and they give you a yes or no answer. Not \"i don't know\" and \"mumbling and going back to doing whatever you were doing\""}
{"text":"I've been eating at Pizzaville as far back as the time they sold their pizzas for $2.80.  That isn't the case anymore - their slices now go for $3.50. Cans of pop are a $1.00 and dipping sauce is $0.50. These prices are taxes in, so you'll still be paying $5.00 or less for a combo, which is great for a meal.  Their pizza slices are very long, and are bigger relative to Pizza Pizza's. The pizza is all stone-oven baked, which gives it a great texture. The crust and toppings are nice and crisp - the generous amount of sauce complements this well.   There aren't any seats, so you can eat your slice on their small ledge with a fantastic view of the parking lot, or have a seat on the few benches outside.   Tip: $0.25 fee for using the debit machine.  Tip: Don't expect slices to be fresh late at night."}
{"text":"By far THE BEST pizza in the GTA i think, I've had countless different pizza's from countless places and this place has to be my favorite spot, just nearly beating Big Slice in downtown toronto, but honestly, the pizza here is perfectly thin, the sauce is perfectly house made, and the toppings are always the perfect amount, not to mention the cheapest price for a slice of pizza... Well done to this location. and always open till the AM"}
{"text":"Service is good. Taste of pizza is horrible i think other big pizza joints way better. I guess something wrong with pizza sauce i don't know but no more Pville"}
{"text":"Pizzaville will fill you up and the deals can make it pretty cheap. We got the walk in special which was a large pizza with 3 toppings for $11. But that's the only good thing about this pizza. I found it to be one of my least favorite pizza joints. Pizza tasted cheap. If i'd compare pizzaville it would be similar to pizza pizza.   If you're just looking for something cheap and filling go ahead but there are tons of better pizza options in the city."}
{"text":"You know, I've been so jaded about the quality of pizza in Toronto that when I parked my car in Pizzaville's small, shared lot (be careful no one parks immediately behind you and blocks you in... no, seriously), I was actually telling myself to be prepared for the same-ol' dry, bland, crackery suckage.  I have never been so happy to be so wrong.    These slices were so laden with cheese and... wow, basil and oregano and...  ohmygod... sauce, they really have sauce on them...  that they did what a proper, honest slice should do:  bend and contort in my hands (both of them!) because of the gooey weight and content of it all.  Nope, no brittle crunchy slice is this, baby.  Nuuuuh uh.  This is what pizza is supposed to be.  Ok, fine, it's a franchise chain.  *sigh*  But, I tells ya, the folks at this particular Pizzaville outlet in High Park seriously know what they are doing.  The place is small with virtually no seating, but plan your orders to go or for delivery.  There's no side table with extra spices... but, trust me, you won't really be needing it.  Ordering is possible through their website.  Crusts come in thin, regular, and thick, and I'm guessing that slices-for-general-order are made with the thick option.  Toppings include bacon, chicken, ground beef, ham, pepperoni, Italian sausage, anchovies (does anybody really use anchovies?), steak, artichoke hearts, black or green olives, broccoli, \"gourmet\" garlic, green chili or jalapeno peppers, green or red (including roasted) or hot banana peppers, mushrooms, red onion, pineapple, sweet cherry or sundried or regular tomato, grilled eggplant, or grilled zucchini, asiago cheese, cheddar, double/extra cheese, feta, gouda, parmesan, provolone, bocconcini, pesto sauce, ginger, or hot chili flakes.  Holy God.  Their assortment of preplanned speciality pizzas include margherita, thin crust potato, thin crust goat cheese, extra thin crust veggie, asiago chicken, smoked gouda and BBQ chicken, parmesan grilled veggie, chicken pesto, the obligatory pepperoni party size, spinach/bacon/goat cheese, kalamata olive and goat cheese, and spinach/chicken/goat cheese.    A small variety of pastas, salads, wings, poppers, and other items are available too.  Definitely worth checking out.  Just, again, make sure no one parks right behind you.  Really."}
{"text":"I had a surprisingly tasty slice of pizza here.  The crust was crispy, but in a deep dish way, even though it wasn't deep dish pizza.  I had a Hawaiian slice, which is kind of my favourite flavor.  I feel like the pizza tastes like the crusts have been treated with butter or something.  That's probably why I liked it.  Everything tastes better with butter."}
{"text":"Underrated pizza that is always fresh with loads of toppings. Delivery option a little pricy but the pizza always comes hot and fresh.y go to pizza place for years now."}
{"text":"Always order from this location! The man who delivers my pizza  is really kind and the BEST! Give him a raise...whoever he is..."}
{"text":"Lil corner spot to get a slice. Not a huge selection of slice options. I find Pizzaville tends to under serve the slice market."}
{"text":"Way, way better than the Pizza Pizza in the area.  Slices are $2.50, tax included.  Also a pretty good garlic bread with cheese (and its quite big!).  Don't waste your money on the wings though, Shangri La is right next door and 10 times better for Wings"}
{"text":"Ordered my pizza on the telephone and came to pick it up.  I didn't experience any of the so called \"friendly\" service.  It's a cramped space, so as I was standing by the cash, two delivery dudes came in and one basically apologized but proceeded to pass me before I got out of the way.  No please or thank you for the total.  Not even a goodbye.  The pizza was good but the bacon was overcooked.  Wouldn't get that again."}
{"text":"I've never been let down here! They've got one of the best crust for a corporate pizza place. Nice chewy on the outside, nice and thin on the bottom."}
{"text":"Last review i forgot to mention a key team member who makes the experience so much better, their delivery driver is one of the nicest and kindest you will meet! He  brought my pizza pipping hot along with a free newspaper and we had a nice chat about weather, week- end plans etc!!  He deserves the staff of the month award for sure!:) it's experiences like this that make me want to order from there only and the competition doesn't stand a chance in my books"}
{"text":"If you like your order screwed up.....TWICE, then by all means, get your pizza from here.   We've been ordering from Pizzaville for years. We used to get it from a Bloor St. location and when that shut down, we were excited that one was opening up that was even closer. Well, closer doesn't necessarily mean better because this place has managed to eff up a pick up order TWICE, even after it was repeated THREE TIMES. So what's the problem? If there is a language issue here, then would it not make more sense to hire people who had maybe more than a slight grasp?  Even though we're big fans of their pizza, we will order one more time because due to our complaint, they're giving us a freebie but once that's done? We're done - with Pizzaville.   With the fast food game being more competitive than ever, why would you keep hiring incompetent people to run yours and therefore risking pissing customers off to the point that they will never, ever order from you again? That's just bad business on Pizzaville's part. Very bad."}
{"text":"Unlike any other Pizzaville!! This store makes the BEST GOURMET PIZZA EVER!! I travel 13 Km to get my Pizza's from this store. The truth is I pass 2 closer stores, but for whatever reason  (love of customers) at 9737 Yonge St  the food just tastes so, so much better.  Of course it's not only the Pizza that stands out, the wings are really good too. they don't use tomato sauce, which I like, so I don't get heartburn!  My favorite is they're Soppressate Pizza.  Soppressate is the name of the Italian salami they use on it, as well as..Sweet Cherry Tomatoes, Spinach, Mozzarella, Mushrooms, Baby Spinach and a Secret Spicy Sauce.  Not very spicy, just for perfect flavoring.   Put this Take Out Store on your Bucket List.   You'll forever thank me."}
{"text":"\"Do you have Canada Dry?\" \"Yes\" \"Ok two canada drys please\" employee charges me then brings me pizza, then gives me two drinks in a very precise (and weird) orientation and runs off to the other side. I turn the bottles around to realize they are two Schweppes. So I call him over and tell him this is Schweppes. I want canada dry.  He blankly stares back at me and says:  \"It's the same pepsi company\".  \"Do you have Canada Dry?\" \"No difference same company. It's pepsi\" \"So you don't have Canada Dry?\" \"No\"  This is only a small part of a very dishonest encounter.  ............I detest dishonesty"}
{"text":"I am not sure which location is actually delivering to our address but this is the nearest one, so I'll review it.  Their pizza is excellent, as the previous reviewer mentioned.  We had the barbecue chicken / smoked gouda combo last night which was terrific and included very nice fresh red onions and shrooms as well.  My partner is a wings fan and feels theirs are some of the best he has tasted yet.  On top of everything else delivery is very fast and pleasant, and their prices are very pleasant too."}
{"text":"Order was completely wrong, tried to substitute a topping I didn't order. Had a credit for a free pizza, they decided not to deliver it to me. Head office granted me more store credit. Terrible service, I like pizzaville. There pizzas are good, I would suggest going to another location. I would give them 0 stars but the option is not available.. Ran out of marinara dipping sauce, I asked for a scoop of pizza sauce seeing they didn't have what I was supposed to get for free. They said they would have to charge extra. I cancelled my order. I will make sure I don't order from this location ever!!!"}
{"text":"Just absolutely LOVE them 8D Going to add pictures on here, too. Never gotten sick and there's almost NEVER any leftovers. Not only that..... they're right up the street from me, too. Good delivery time and terrific Panzos, as well."}
{"text":"The one thing I really like about pizzaville is that they bake everything, nothing is fried. And it does make a difference in the taste.   The panzerottis here taste really good because they make it fresh and it's baked in their oven, so you gotta wait about 15 mins. It's cheap and for a fast food chain, its not that bad. The sauce they use here for the panzos & pizza is different. They actually use whole tomatoes for the sauce that you can actually taste. They have tv here so you don't get so bored while you wait.   When i used to live around this area I would get the wings too sometimes. Not that bad. Get the buffalo chicken wings with BBQ and they give you garlic bread too. It's not the best, but the panzos they have here are real tasty, believe it or not. it's not too bad."}
{"text":"Love this place. Reliable. Always gets my order right.  Friendly staff.  Nice clean space.  Seats to sit down and eat or wait. Tasty pizza.  Come here all the tome."}
{"text":"I have ordered panzerottis here four times. Once pick up and three times delivery. I used to love getting Pizzaville panzerottis in my old neighbourhood but I have realized now it was the location that was so good. The first two times from this location they were undercooked and really soggy from too much sauce.  So the next time I ordered delivery online and put in for it to be cooked extra long and with light sauce. It was a lot better. The toppings were all scrunched to one side, and there was barely any sauce (but I did ask for light) but overall it was alright. My forth and final time I ordered online again but the delivery driver was so damn rude and made me feel very uncomfortable on my front porch at 1am. Never again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great pizza! 10/10 would recommend to everyone. Been coming here for a while and never thought to leave a review until now. Definitely my go to spot for pizza!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good, sauce was the best part, delivery time was ok, still looking for the best delivery pizza!  Gluten free one was rated as good by the daughter."}
{"text":"A regular for us for ordering pizza. The thin slice full pizzas are very good. The wings or decent but this is a pizza place so won't hold them to it. I prefer pizzaville over any of the name brand pizzerias. This and pizzaiolo are my favourite."}
{"text":"I get panzos here and they are always consistent and delicious. The dough isn't always sealed well (folded and pressed) so that irks me a little.   They recently renovated- a more clean and modern feel.  People here are friendly!"}
{"text":"They do not care about loyalty or business...They cannot even make a decent pizza....I will be buying elsewhere...I expect a decent pizza for the prices they are charging...Then they have their employees abusing customers on the phone.....Enough is enough .  7 years of loyalty..The Pizzas use to be quite good.."}
{"text":"Ugh man.. the owner of this location is hard to deal with and rude, and when they screw up simple orders like a pepperoni only panzo and you get one with three toppings you didn't order and cold cheese, sucks... won't be going back and I enjoy pizzaville normally..."}
{"text":"I LOVE there pizza, always cooked to perfection. The people that work there are always nice and the delivery people are awesome. Always have a treat for my dog when they come to the door. I've eaten hear a hundred times and never disappointed. The prices always really affordable for the quality."}
{"text":"I have been to Pizzaville before but this location I wanted to try the walk in special. I ordered a large pizza, the taste was good but the cheese was like marshmallows melted,too thick and would not break in a bite.   Pizza is more about the cheese so they should use the best quality cheese."}
{"text":"I wanted a late night dinner, and my partner recommended this location. The whole plaza is actually very nice, and the Longos next to Pizzaville looks like a restructured brewery; pretty neat! Parking wasn't an issue. Upon entering this Pizzaville, the associates were chatting about work and acknowledged us. I got a slice of Margherita pizza, and my partner got a pepperoni slice. Along with a bottle of Brisk Lemonade, the total after taxes came to $11.05. We took a seat at one of the comfy booths, and a few minutes later, our pizza was ready! Each of the booths have a small tv so you can watch the news as you enjoy your pizza. That was pretty neat. Not even the gourmet pizza restaurants I've been to have this! The architecture of this location also gives off the impression that this place used to be a bachelor pad of some sort. I loved it. Very modern.   Now the pizza: it was simply scrumptious! There was a perfect balance of cheese and dried tomato on my slice, and the crust was not too hard, soft, or chewy. It was just right: a light crunch. The pizza also isn't as greasy as Pizza Hut. The grease level is on par with Pizza Pizza, but Pizza Pizza never got their crust or balance of ingredients as good as Pizzaville. The associate had a sense of humor and joked with us for a little bit before our pizza was ready.   As I was eating, my partner also told me that this is where her family always got their take-out pizza from. I've tried the spinach, bacon, and goat cheese pizza before and it is SOOOOO GOOD. So is the Supreme. I love it all. I definitely recommend this location! If your date loves pizza and you want to impress them, this is definitely your go-to place!"}
{"text":"We often visit this location to pick up our online orders. The pizzas are excellent, and we are always welcomed with a friendly greeting. The unfortunate thing is that we can't seem to receive online deliveries from this location - they always come from Queen East, and their pizzas are consistently prepared incorrectly (wrong toppings!) and arrive cold. If you want a delicious, hot and tasty pizza, get it here!"}
{"text":"Our online orders regularly come from the Queen east location. While we love Pizzaville, this locations consistently delivers pizzas with the wrong toppings. The toppings are also usually scattered unevenly and much of the dough is bare. We've also had bad dealings with two delivery people. Save yourself the disappointment and pick up a pizza from the East York (Laird) location. For some reason, we can't seem to have their awesome pizzas delivered to us! Thumbs down."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pizza place and I always get amazing service and amazing quality! The store is clean and the staff are very friendly. I highly recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"I started ordering from them frequently, at first thing were great.  But then the quality started going downhill, and they started to get stingy with the toppings.  I hit my breaking point when an order of double bacon only got me one piece an inch long on several slices.  A complaint to head office got me a credit that I used on my last pizza from them.  Still not enough bacon for a double order, and it was burnt."}
{"text":"Fast delivery, nice and hot, decent this pizza, nive on phone and delivery"}
{"text":"Skip it. Pizza was dry with minimal taste. Garlic breadstix are even worse!  After 1 bite each, we threw them in the trash. Seriously. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!  Roasted Garlic Dipping Sauce was from Hellman's with a mayonnaise-like base. WHO PUTS MAYO ON PIZZA?  Expected an oil-based dipping sauce. Extra cheese was what we'd call \"regular cheese\".  Delivery took 40 minutes on a weekday night, within the parameters stated when order placed. Arrived luke warm. Will not return-EVER."}
{"text":"Best pizza store ever. Fun and nice workers. Here was my best pizza place for 5 years and cannot find anywhere better."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pizzaville location. The food is well made, appropriate amount of toppings, cooked properly and with a sense of care (which is all quite opposite of my experience with another pizzaville location). This is not the closest location to me, so I can't get delivery (I'm forced to use another location if I want delivery), but it is worth going here for the difference in quality. In general, I find the pizza from pizzaville better than most other chain pizza places. Things like potato wedges that is not the case (head office standard is a real small portion and higher price compared to other pizza places, drastically so), but the pizza is the main thing. If you want to try, or have already tried another location, try this one, they set the standard for pizza from pizzaville."}
{"text":"Hand tossed pizza? They tossed it up and gave me the 1 finger salute. I've had over \"100 stamps\" from pizzaville, I'm as regular as you can get.   I'm mad... It's not a one off but it is the straw that broke the camels back, i digress.  The online ordering promises 20 minutes for pick up, and it's the only way to get stamps... But on several occasions the \"system\" was wrong and I ended up waiting longer then I should(the other chain gives it to you free if not ready) I changed my routine, if it said ready in XXX(yeah I like the radio ads), I would leave my house at XXX arriving as it comes out of the oven.  The price isn't cheaper vs the competition, but you get the stamps buy 6 get 1 free. Savings !!  despite the deficiencies and price I'd still keep coming back it tastes good....   Price it's a 3 Speed it's a 3 Taste 5 Online ordering easy and fast and free stuff 5stars And you have to give them 5 stars for rainy days in pizzaville ads... \"free 6 free 6\" or was it \"3 se.....\""}
{"text":"Yes I know this is a chain pizza place, but it's the closest pizza place to me other than the the cardboard that is sold at Pizza Pizza, and I actually prefer it to King Slice up the road!   The staff is always so friendly to me and always remembers my order (which may be a sign that I go here too often).   Overall, great value and great pizza for a chain!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE location! They can't make pizza or panzerotti if their life depends on it! Panzerroti always split open, pizza has such little toppings that it looks like a cheese pizza. And don't get me started on how they slice the pizza. My parents live around the corner in the subdivision within walking distance. We ordered 2 party size for pick up and some of the squares were so small while others were huge. It was embarrassing considering we didn't end up having enough pizza for everyone and the slices we had to cut became so small it was annoying and time consuming. Everyone laughed about it asking if our 2 year old sliced the pizza.  We were at a kids party a couple of months ago and they refused to deliver to an address because the customer had made a complaint about their location 2-3 times on quality etc. How unprofessional! Lucky for the host that there is no shortage of pizza in the area. They lost out on a huge order and everyone at the party that lives in the area was not impressed. Even the party place said they have had so many problems from this store.  Wont be back and i know my parents will not order from them again. From now on i will pick up in Unionville at the other location."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza thin crust bacon double pineapple it's was awesome best pizza I've had in awhile I also got chicken bites they were just ok but pizza was so good I gave 5 stars anyway yummy"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had. Amazing dough and fresh toppings. It's so much better than pizza pizza. Try it, you'll thank me after"}
{"text":"Craving for pizza the other day, I decided to order a pizza to take home for lunch. Hearing good reviews about Pizzaville, I opted to try it rather than the Domino's close by. The pizza was cooked quickly and I was able to pick it up while it was still pretty hot. Being close to a school nearby, the place was crowded with students.  The pizza was made as a thin crust with pepperoni, bacon, and mushrooms as toppings. It tasted OK, but I still preferred Domino's as my go-to pizza chain. The amount of sauce and toppings was sparse. Also, it would have been better if they put actual sliced mushrooms instead of what looked like the bottom of the container mushroom shavings.  Would I come back again? No, unless the nearby Domino's closes down!"}
{"text":"Tamal said he was going to make me the best pizza in Toronto!!!   He wasn't joking!!!!   I will drive across town for one of his pizzas!!!!"}
{"text":"Used to have the best Panzerotti in the region, now they have decided to go for the smallest! Shrunk from 12\" to around 6! Another 2 \" of shrinkage and McCain's Pizza Pockets will be bigger. So disappointed, I will never return to this location!"}
{"text":"Don't know what has happened...but in the last year this place has gone from stellar to \"meh\".  Last order was dreadful....2 panzos....they were awful. Hardly any stuffing, 0 flavour, a tad on the gummy side, plus they were cold. I had to nuke them to make them edible. The extra sauce I ordered had to be nuked as well.....it was cold. Not lukewarm, not cool, cold. Pizza was cardboard with cheese, bacon and Jalepeno on top. It was cold as well.  Will not order from this place again."}
{"text":"Pizza was crispy and surprisingly tasty considering it was 2am. Or perhaps especially because it was 2am. A generous amount of toppings made me feel like I got my money's worth. Location is kind of hidden a bit but the bright red sign will guide you there."}
{"text":"He told me to take what he has or to not bother him.  Not my kind of place.  It looked like it was made two days ago."}
{"text":"Couple of weeks ago I would have still given this pizza place 5 Stars but since the owner switched it's been just down hill. First time I went there I ordered my regular 8 garlic cheese stix and they were a disaster, that same evening I went back to talk to a staff that was still working there from the old owner and asked him what has happened. He is the one that informed me that the owners changed. So I wrote Pizzaville to please give these guys an inservice on how to make pizza. Because what used to be a fluffy, cheese, tasty mozzarella garlic cheese stix was a dried out, barely covered with cheese half the thickness 3 day old tasting cardboard stix. I mean I had to give it to my dogs and even they were choking it down.  Pizzaville was nice enough to refund me the hole prize and they added enough so I could order a large pizza. Well I gave them another chance and hoped they just had a bad day...well I was wrong I had the same experience with my large Pizza. I hope they will fix this location because I really loved my pizza from here and I live right around the corner."}
{"text":"I love their stone oven baked pizza! It is my go to pizza place, and it's relatively inexpensive - 13.99 (I think) for a three topping pizza of your choice :)  Try it out! Maybe you'd like it as much as I do!"}
{"text":"I order from here all the time.   The food comes quick and is well cooked.  Love the chicken wings and panzerotti the most.    Lately the pizzas been a problem.  Whether delivered or picked up the pizza and box are both soggy by the time it gets to my place.  Its off putting.    Their customer service is great, when you call and complain they try and solve it right away, although it ends up being having another soggy pizza delivered I"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here apparently for \"the best pizza ever\" and the only place that makes you want to eat everything when you walk in because of the amazing aroma.  And so we ate here, small place with about 4 tables. Lots of in/outs customers for takeouts, 4 hardworking staff on a very quiet Sunday evening.   We ordered the panzerotti, like a patty stuffed with pizza fillings. Ours was fried and had cheese, pepperoni, and mushrooms. There is the option to have it fried or baked. This was REALLY good and extremely hot. Very filling too, I love the cheese.  We also ordered a quick slice of pizza with beef. The beef was soooooo good and so was their cheese. I like this more than Pizza Pizza's!  The best best best part.... is the awesome amazing pizza's they have: Potato, Grilled Chicken Classic, Bacon Cheeseburger, and Smoked Gouda BBQ Chicken. I LOVE chicken on pizza, I'll be ordering from here for my next dinner party."}
