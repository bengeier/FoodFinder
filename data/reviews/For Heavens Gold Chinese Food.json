{"text":"This place is amazing! Order is prepared while you wait. Food portions are huge and cheap. Have not found anything on the menu that I don't like. Can't go wrong with any noodle or beef dishes. Personal favs are Singapore Style Vermicelli, Beef with Black Bean, Spicy Salty pork chop on Veg Fried rice, and beef with mixed veg on rice noodles.  This place is a gem and gets busy around 12 so arrive early."}
{"text":"The quality of food here is not that great. Sure the prices are affordable but that's only because it's Chinese takeout. So considering it's comparable with other food court prices, I wouldn't be inclined to come here again. (FYI: the chinese bbq rice store next door is so much tastier!)  We ordered stir fry chow mein noodles and stir fry beef flat noodles - both of which the noodles were too doughy and dense. They also had chewy/poor cuts of meat and were overall very greasy dishes."}
{"text":"co-worker brought this in for lunch- Cant go wrong. he tells me there is a line up at this place all the time. I can understand why.  $7- brings you oodles of noodles. I ate half and have the same feeling as I would walking out of a AYCE. Wish I had someone to share this with. Maybe share with myself for dinner.  $7 for 2 meals?? maybe 3 if you arent greedy.  Great Value!"}
{"text":"I did not know there was a food court here. Huh. Came after church with friends on Sunday. Had the Chow Kuai Teow (fried curry rice noodles with shrimp, char siu strips, and veggies). Portions are huge. I had about a third of my food? The box was packed full. Tasty, but not completely mixed (I found a few white noodles amidst the sea of yellow ones). Quite spicy. Thankful for my soy milk. I love soy milk.   There is seating, but supposedly, there's a 20 minute limit. We sat longer than that. No one chased us out.   I wouldn't say it's my favorite Chinese stir fry place, but it's not bad.  Logos note: fairly fast. No waits for food court seating. Cheap."}
{"text":"Cheap and decent quality food with large quantity. Don't eat too much of this food at once though or you'll definitely get stomach aches!"}
{"text":"Huge variety of rice, noddles, vermicelli and rice noddles. The price starts from $5.49 (and up) + tax per dish but almost everything comes with a drink (tea or soya milk). Portion is massive even for Chinese takeout. The dish is hot and fresh because they make your dish as soon as you order.  There's a food court with seating if you wish to enjoy your dish hot and don't want it to cool on the way home."}
{"text":"Sadly it is closed I wonder where did they went?!?! Too much rent to pay I guess. It was great food as usual and also takes a long time to make your food as there are other orders to make. Cheap price cut huge portions. Now an empty lot with the next door BBQ. I know it's probably a hidden gem but still a food court food. Sadly it's going to be missed as more businesses open."}
{"text":"The only 2 things that stand out for this place is the price and the portion.  The foods here taste awful.  I would rather cook myself a instant noodle and would be more satisfied."}
