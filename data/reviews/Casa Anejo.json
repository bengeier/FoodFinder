{"text":"Great Happy Hour! Loved the DJ. Song choices were awesome and the music wasn't too loud to chat with our friends. Loved the Guac and Hibiscus Marg."}
{"text":"The guac came out missing the build your own ingredients...yes just avocado. Which was crazy considering the last few visits it was always the highlight. 

We had to ask for water and waited 10 min for our beverages. They were supposed to course out the meal but brought my husbands meal and mine 15 min apart. 

Dbacks are playing and TV all of a sudden gets changed to Hot Rod Racing?!? WTF. They have serveral tvs and they cannot leave the local team on? 

It was the straw."}
{"text":"Was disappointed overall. Went in with 2 adults and a 2 year old. We had 2 house margaritas (they are super small), a basic guacamole, kids quesadilla and lemonade, veggie tacos and a pork dish. Our bill was $85 before tip and we all left hungry. The portions are too small for the price and overall way too expensive for the quality/quantity. There are too many other good choices in the neighborhood, pass on Casa Anejo."}
{"text":"Came here to try since it's located on the growing 7th St. 

All I gotta say is... meh. 

Heard servers complaining about girls not giving good tables? Big Turn off and tip reducer. The food was decent but the drinks were amazing. The music was super loud and nobody seemed to care. 

I feel like everyone including the management needs to grow up and be trained again. Customers hear how everyone talks to each other. 

I may come again for a drink. Maybe."}
{"text":"Funny to read the one and two star reviews on a restaurant that's been open for all of 5 days.  You don't judge a place on its first week, let alone its first 18 weeks.  If you want a Margarita in under 4 minutes.. don't come to a Mexican restaurant on its grand opening... on the 5th of may.  My experience was fantastic... great food, great drinks and great service.  Lorenzo was all over our table and chef Pe√±a even came out to say hello.  If you haven't been here yet, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Prices were great for Taco Tuesday, However, the food was very sub par. Atmosphere is nice though"}
{"text":"It was love at first sight (and bite). This place is amazing! My love for guacamole, tacos, and decor is captured in this very place! I was in awe of all the detail--even the pitchers have style! I wanted to know where to purchase on for myself.  Globally inspired design with a very modern and hip twist. Every dish I tried was fantastic. The nachos, tacos, the variety of salsas, and of course the customizable guacamole. The server could have definitely been around more, but the food made up for it. This is a MUST try. 
Not sure why a see posts about the music being so deafening. Perhaps it was the time you chose to go? I went at night and it was on a Sunday. Maybe that's why. There was still a DJ, but we had a large party for a birthday and had no trouble hearing one another."}
{"text":"Service was great! Jesse was our server and he was really nice. The kitchen closed shortly after we arrived so we were only able to get the late night menu but that was amazing!  Try the Sonoran dog it is amazing!"}
{"text":"Loved the 3 taco assortment. It was a hearty meal and well presented. Their guacamole is yummy. The tea was so good we got some to take home. Overall, its a great Phoenix experience with good, flavorful food and great service. We'll return."}
{"text":"Good guacamole and nice decor but the loud dance club music ruins it. It's absolutely blaring while you're trying to dine--both on the patio and inside. (And we were there on a mellow Sunday night!) If people wanted a night club atmosphere they'd go to a night club. When people go to a restaurant, they generally want to talk. The entire staff appears to be 16 years old and they act and speak as such."}
{"text":"Service was fine, food and bills came out quickly.  

Ate on the patio and asked if the music could be turned down a little so our small group could hear each other better. Our waiter said it wasn't possible, something to do with management requirements...

Order our food - got 2 posoles and a bean burrito.  The burrito was big and it made my husband very happy and full. The posole came out a good temperature and ready to eat but tasted like chili - all that was missing was cheese and cornbread (or however you dress your chili.)   Asked for tortillas for dipping but was not asked which kind - we were first brought corn, then flour.  Some sad info for whoever reads this far: they don't make their tortillas. The shape and smell of them are the give away.  And if the management or chefs are reading this, I know making tortillas is a laborious task with demand always outweighing the supply. We have quite a few gourmet street taco restaurants here in Phoenix to pick from, the best ones make their own tortillas (IMO)."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Nice guy but clueless. Waited way to long to get served. Then too long to get a drink of water. Then the food came and it tasted burnt.  Waiter was slow and like I said clueless. Never coming back"}
{"text":"The company I was with was five stars.
The staff...beautiful. 
The music was some pretty awesome old school stuff that would score a five after a solid drink. 
Speaking of drinks. Went for HH and all margaritas were $5. That's sweet...unfortunately
so were the drinks. 
Majority of the salsa/dip options were also sweet. Bleh. 
Skip the Chicaronnes- those are some bagged variety from FoodCity.
I had some HH dish that I am still undecided on the flavor combinations. But worse yet, portions of it were fridge temp cold. Unappetizing. 
The biggest let down were the churros; those just tasted like pancakes :("}
{"text":"The greatest tacos to have ever existed reside in the valley. If you would like 1$ tacos there are literally hundreds of places in the valley to get them. These are not 1$ tacos these are the greatest tacos to have ever existed they cost around 4$ a piece.  I had never had octopus tacos until Anejo and it is truly something to behold. You can also get street corn all over the valley but again it's not like this. Chef Joe and Drew have put love into every dish and the quality is phenomenal."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and each experience was great. First time was for HH and my date and I split some appetizers and had a few margaritas each. The made to order guac is amazing, and the street corn is he best corn dish that I've had. The bar tender also made me a spicy margarita with a muddled pepper and cucumber that was refreshing yet hot. 
Second visit was late at night and they had someone playing music, with a younger crowd of people and a good vibe in the place. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Food isn't very good.   Upscale doesn't necessarily equal good. Having to buy 3 of one taco instead of trying different ones is not customer friendly at all especially with a new restaurant where you want to try things.  Drinks are small and average.  Staff was friendly but clearly new."}
{"text":"Went to check out Casa Anejo and, unfortunately, found the 3 star average to be pretty accurate. Happy hour $5 margarita was pretty good, as were the chips, salsa, and guacamole. The service was lacking. We sat at the bar and it wasn't very busy, but the particularly ripped dude seemed as though he did not want to be bothered with us. Mustache guy was nice. I ordered the relleno tacos and the balance of ingredients was not great. They were loaded with cheese and way too much garlic. If I'd had the option to mix and match various tacos, I would have, but apparently that is only allowed on Tuesdays. For a place that focuses on tacos, it would make more sense to be able to get more than one kind of taco."}
{"text":"Hate to give it such a low score, but after waiting over an hour for our entree I have to. I seriously got up and refilled my own water cup not once, but twice. Service seems to be a common problem. Food - amazing. Not worth it though from an overall experience"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night. It was somewhat busy but we got seating outside right away!

To start, the Guac bar option is great, and it was PHENOM. Really well made, and a very generous portion with light and crispy chips. Such a beautiful primer for our dinner.

I ordered their greyhound for a cocktail with Guac, but didn't get it come until after the entrees came. Not a huge deal for me, but I was definitely left wondering for a bit. Our waitress was very polite, but must have been very busy. Cocktail wasn't good. It might have been half tequila, half grapefruit. Its alcohol though, so whatever! 

Quelites Tacos: I love me some braised greens. Unfortunately I couldn't even bite through them, they were really tough. Also queso fresco was missing. Tasted like spicy oil and not much else. The waitress very nicely gave us an order of the Carne Asada tacos when we had said we weren't into the Quelites. We'll get to that.

Dobles Tacos: Soft taco wrapping a crunchy taco! So happy they thought of putting their spin on this when we ordered it. Unfortunately the spin was bland ground beef, and was missing the avocado, beans, and crema as well. Probably wouldn't have saved it. We ate it anyways, because we were hungry. We let the waitress know what was missing so she could relay to back of house staff for the future.

Bonus round: Carne Asada tacos
Highly recommended by our waitress. It was just the meat though, no scallion or tomatillo I think was what was supposed to be there? Very grisly. Lots of purely fatty bits. At this point we were defeated, paid the bill, and made our exit.

We live very close to where Casa Anejo is located, and I honestly hope it improves. Probably won't return, as there are so many excellent places around here that offer impeccable service, and amazing food to risk spending another $50 on an evening out here. Unfortunately I have heard similar experiences from others, and this is not sustainable in an area that is turning out to be so highly competitive, perhaps even experiencing a restaurant bubble."}
{"text":"Lol and now they're closed. We guessed that one easily. Hmmmm. Better luck next time guys ;)"}
{"text":"The food was fair.  The service was so-so.  Prices were only decent because we happened to catch happy hour.  Beautiful decor.  The music was so bleeping loud you could not converse.  We were seated inside but it was really cold, assuming to compensate for the outdoor patio (it was 86 degrees outside).  Moved outside, but the music was even louder out there.  Miserable experience.  I'm sticking with the mom & pop, good ole reliable places that you can enjoy your meal without loosing your hearing or getting frostbite.  Sadly, another flash in the pan (especially when you see the drink prices...so pricey)."}
{"text":"As we begin to see more tequila/taco places pop up, so did Casa Anejo. The same operating group which runs Stock and Stable as well as the speakeasy above S&S also operates Casa Anejo. This is a cool spot for a happy hour cocktail but not food. The taco menu is a mixture of Taco Bell (which is not a bad thing) and any other street taco stand out there. The only difference is that the prices here are high for what it is.....I honestly believe you could stop at Taco Bell and either get the double decker or just a regular hardshell taco,sneak them into the restaurant, ask for a plate, place the Taco Bell Tacos on the plate, and the servers would not know what happened. It is pretty hard to screw up Tacos and Margaritas, hence my 3 star rating, but for the price, it will be easy to see why this place will be closed within a year. The rent is too high, which is the reason for the high prices, and whomever the chef is who inspired this menu has the creativity of the likes of Mr Ronald McDonald, cernal sanders, or any other fast food inspired mascot."}
{"text":"True to taste!  We will be going going back for dinner and tequila.  The service from the grill guys was the most amazing part of the experience!"}
{"text":"Great spot with fantastic music and sound system. The menu is very contemporary Mexican and we liked it very much. The service was good and moderately priced. The Carmel corn is a great starter"}
{"text":"Trendy, youthful and mediocre. HUGE selection of tequilas, but the food is nothing special and only the manager really cares about customers. The staff acts like they've got better things to do than wait on you. I felt sorry for the manager and hope he fires the ungrateful lot of self-impresssed kids."}
{"text":"Not too sure what to think about this place it's not really a Mexican restaurant it's more of the bar taco shop more bars than anything music spray Loud live DJ which is great for a bar so if you're looking for a place to just go out and eat that one and go here but definitely a place to go eat and hang out have some fun very much so now for the food I have the calabasa the chile relleno and octopus calabasa it's pretty good plenty of flavor squash was cook pretty good not too mushy so It had some firmness to it the Chile was my favorite hot full of cheese how can you beat that octopus I was most excited for it I almost puked it was disgusting it tastes like rotten fish never again will I get back iPad an octopus at many a places nothing that tasted that disgusting the ceviche was okay little flavorless would not get it again the thing I would go out of my way to get would be there churros they may not be authentic that they are damn good I'm from tally and growing up on them I know a good churro and is probably the best tasting one ever crunching outside light and fluffy in the inside perfect amount of cinnamon sugar and my wife says they have the best Long Island Iced Tea she's ever had that's pretty much all she drinks anywhere we go service was good we sat at the bar so we got our drinks right when they find them and the food runs are kind of dumb the end over any food win saw that kept on getting food mixed up between people but no big deal definitely go back for the churros and a Long Island's if if not anything else"}
{"text":"Great happy hour margaritas and the nachos are delish. Huge portion for only $7 on hh! Cool ambience. We will be back fo sho!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch with a few friends and wanted to share this great review with others. The decor, atmosphere, service, and staff were wonderful. Seating is available for the outdoor patio. We chose to sit indoors since it wasn't too crowded and noisy. It was a great place to enjoy a casual Saturday lunch with friends. They offered a brunch menu that looked great but we were interested in trying the Tacos from the Taco menu.  Two of us chose the vegetarian taco with zucchini. Excellent! I'm a cook and appreciate the art and skill of presenting a dish with layers of flavor and balance. It was delicious. If you are looking for heat, they offer 3 levels of salsa at the table for you to use according to your own taste buds. The others chose fish tacos. One was the traditional Baja cod taco and the other was swordfish. They also enjoyed their flavors and eating experience. Overall, I recommend this restaurant for the excellent food and excellent service! I imagine if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, it will be crowded with a fun drinking atmosphere! Nice Happy Hour selections, too."}
{"text":"Great food and great ambiance! We sat at the bar and received great service from our bartender (don't remember his name). We tried about six different drinks between the 2 of us and all were delicious. Mango margarita was my favorite! We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"This was my second time here, and now I wonder why I've only been twice. We were in on a Saturday night and had a wonderful experience, the food was by far the best part the night. Ruben the GM made us feel so welcomed and cane by the booth a couple times to make sure we were all happy. The was absolutely delicious, some of the best Mexican food I've had. It was full of flavor and was not to heavy. The vibe was also a big part of the experience, the music was hip and the over decor makes for a very comfortable setting. We sat indoors but if you go the patio looked really nice and will ask for a patio table next time.  We were all very happy with food and service, everyone I came with all agreed that they will all come back. The prices are very reasonable for the quality and portions of the food, they also have a great margarita selection and the ones we had were fantastic. I would definitely recommend this place!

{"text":"The ambience was great but the food was lackluster at best.  How can you do bland Mexican??  I would like to point out the service was excellent but we went for lunch and the place was pretty much dead."}
{"text":"Great night out! Four of us sat outside on a hot summer's night but their misters made it extremely comfortable (they are large and high so they just cool the patio without a drop of moisture hitting you). Beautiful space with great attention to detail, from the tile around the bar to the avocado shaped hostess stand. We had the house margaritas, which were great (though I wish the glass they came in were a little 'fancier' - they were basically tumblers). Two of our party had the whole fish and loved it. I had the Doble tacos and the Octopus tacos - both recommended by our server and both were delicious. We started with guac - also delicious. Great atmosphere and very comfortable. Hands down I will go back (a lot!)."}
{"text":"First time at Casa Anejo last night. The patio is AMAZING! Such a nice outdoor dining experience in the Uptown Phoenix.  My husband and I split their build your own guacamole. We thought the guac was delicious. I am allergic to tomatoes and it is difficult to find guac without tomatoes. Love that I can build it without. My husband had the Sonoran Dog which he said was \"like a foodie chef reinterpreted a side of the road Sonoran Dog\".  I order the small green chili pork. For me, I thought the pork was forgettable. I also thought their drinks were a little pricey. So, I did not partake. Although, I was interested in some of the margaritas. I'd love to come back during happy hour. For me, I'd go back for the guac alone, and that's pretty much enough for me!"}
{"text":"Definitely will come back!  Service. .food., drinks A +++ .. ceviche... carne asada burrito and empanadas all delious!"}
{"text":"I have been reading the reviews since Casa A√±ejo opened and they haven't been to great.  Let me start by saying that as soon as we walked in you can see the potential for a cool spot. We didn't have time for dinner but we did have time for a few Adult beverages. From the moment we sat down our Bar tender Sal was focused, friendly and attentive, Sal was awesome! I figured since being in a Spanish style restaurant we would have too order margaritas. They did not disappoint! We tried 4 different flavors Mango, Watermelon, Kiwi and the house blend. All of them tasted wonderful, even on the strong side which is how I like them. We did order a few appetizers just to get a quick sample of the style of food and flavor. The Ceviche was simple but did have fantastic tostones served with it(I recommend they add a little heat).The empanadas were my favorite with a light crust and fresh chorizo. We look forward to returning when we have more time to enjoy dinner. One recommendation for management encourage your hostess to show a little more energy beyond their smiles. Returning soon! Thank you Sal."}
{"text":"Oh man - went here for the first time today for lunch on Taco Tuesday. You can mix & match three - only on Taco Tuesday so take advantage of that! We shared all six meat and fish tacos and they were some of the best we've ever tasted. Afterward and stuffed we noticed the $3 Street Corn - our son insisted we try it. Grilled corn, queso fresco, onion, etc. and...the best part...crunched up Chili Cheese Fritos hot and dancing together in the coolest little bowl. Despite being completely stuffed I took a bite...simply one of the best bites of food ever! Crunchy, sweet, tastes popping throughout the chew...it was amazing! This is a gem restaurant at 7th & Missouri. Service is outstanding, prices are reasonable (especially on Tuesday) and the atmosphere is fun & authentic. You have to go!"}
{"text":"Nice place, music is too loud can't talk to each other.  Guacamole was delish, drinks are small and overpriced. Food was ehhhh"}
{"text":"What a fabulous introduction to Casa Anejo.  We had margs and the nachos at the bar.  We were going to have more food but the nacho portion was so large it was just not possible to order anything else and they were so good we couldn't stop eating them.  Sal and Jeremy were fabulous bartenders and were very knowledgeable about the menu etc.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"A very unimpressive dining experience. It started out promising when we were informed it was \"happy hour all day.\" The frozen house margaritas were icy and mediocre. Chips and salsa are not complimentary but $5.00 ($3.00 on happy hour)--strike one. The papas and chorizo appetizer was pretty good and spicy, though the included cooked egg was near room-temperature.
Things digressed when we went to order some tacos (three for $10.00) but were informed you have to order all three of the same kind, and that a la carte tacos (i.e., to be able to order different kinds) are only available on Tuesday- -WTF... So we got the queso fundido, which was gummy, bland, not quite hot enough temperature-wise, and overpriced at $13 with a tablespoon of chorizo thrown in. 
The atmosphere is bland. The television right above us was showing a grainy replay of a golf tournament from the 1970s (Lee Trevino was leading), and there was actually a \"dj\"with headphones and MacBook ensconced in one of the corners apparently responsible for the unmemorable soundtrack being piped throughout the restaurant. 
Service at the bar was not good. They were over-staffed with three people working the half-full bar and restaurant. The young woman and the guy with the hipster mustache were very friendly and helpful. However, there was clearly no communication between the three of them, as they would each ask the same questions. Overly attentive at the beginning, later there was a lengthy wait between the time we finished eating to receive the bill. Then, when I pointed out to the third bartender that two of the happy-hour items we had been charged full price for, there ensued another lengthy wait, a discussion with some of the managers, and then I had to ask (the same guy) for the bill again. After returning with the sales slip, he acted put-out by having to have the bill corrected (he clearly didn't have the authority to make the $5 correction) and, possibly inadvertently, slammed the bill and wooden holder down on the bar with saying anything.  Do us all a favor--lose the attitude and hone some basic service skills, or please get out of the service industry. 
Sitting in the increasingly dreary restaurant waiting for all this to play out, it was soon completely clear that we will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Has potential to be good but right now the service isn't quite dialed in+ really need to figure out that noise from 7th. It's constant. food was good service needs to do a better job of explaining and helping."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch today, for the first time, and we ordered the pop rock guacamole and a torts and chilaquiles. Yum! We enjoyed the bloody Mary's and margaritas. Kat was our server, and she was very attentive and friendly. It was a great brunch!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend always like to try new places and know 7th st is notorious for good restaurants. So we ended up at this place casa a√±ejo and had the best time and decided to become regulars. Service is great, the bartender Sal was awesome. They had a great happy hour and you can even make your own GUAC! And I love guac! Definitely a place to stop by and see if you love tacos and tequila! 
Will definitely be returning(:"}
{"text":"Stopped in here awhile back on a bike tour of happy hours around our neighborhood. First and last \"visit.\" 

Not particularly busy, sat on the nearly deserted restaurant side of the bar. Bartenders and bar backs stepping over each other to do next to nothing except chat with a few people on the patio side of the bar. 

Bar back brought us waters. We looked at the menu for a good 10 minutes. No one ever acknowledged us at all. Got up and left 5 min. later. 

Hostess asked why we were leaving so soon. Told her there was no one working at the bar. Went down the street to our favorite cluster of Windsor, Joyride and Federal Pizza, which is what we should have done in the first place. Shame on me for trying to give Casa Asshole my money. 

Fuck this whole plaza. All these restaurants here, like quite a few others in the area, are trying waaaaaaay to hard to skate by on image alone. Service, consistency and quality are what keeps the doors open for decades. NEXT!"}
{"text":"A three star because the bartenders are great.  Had lunch yesterday for Taco Tuesday. Someone has changed the recipes.  The chicken used to be large chunks -now  a shredded mess. The carne asada was a large, delicious, hunk of meat - now miniscule, kibble squares and deffinitely not delicious. Please go back to the old recipes!"}
{"text":"Went here for tacos and drinks on a Friday night. Great ambiance both inside and out. Good music selection throughout the night. Build your own guacamole was an excellent treat. Had doble and chorizo doble tacos..not a fan of their double shell. Great drinks and late night happy hour specials"}
{"text":"I can't tell you how the food was because I didn't even get to sit down. We went here for my birthday and they told us it would be a 45 minute wait so we said okay. Which we couldn't understand because there were so many empty tables. We waited the 45 minutes and still no table! So we left and ate at pure sushi. We ate and left and on our drive home got a text our table was ready an hour and a half later!!! Horrible service! Will never go back.

5/31/18 LOL I see they closed due to being so crappy! KARMA!"}
{"text":"After missing opening week for the restaurant I'm kind of glad I didn't waste my time with the long wait times. I was crazy excited for this place after seeing all the Instagram posts. I started with the ceviche, now this is the highlight of my dinner! Probably the best ceviche I've had at a restaurant including Mexican seafood places. I ordered the chorizo tacos and crap they were spicy to the point where my lips started burning and became uncomfortable. I also had the Double tacos, I have little to say about them, they tried to outdo the Double decker taco from Taco Bell and was a half a step above that, the bland avacodo didn't help either. I would recommend exploring the Menu, I will visit again and try something different."}
{"text":"Came in on cinco de mayo, which was their opening day. They were super busy but appeared to be handling their business very affectively under the pressure of it being a busy opening day. I ordered a cocktail ( I can't remember what it was called) and it had mezcal, lime, plum, and thyme. It was sooo good, and the bartender was way awesome. For food I had the crispy octopus tacos. One of the best tacos I've ever had. Tasted authentic but with a trained culinary twist. My only criticism is that the whole place looks super cute, with a kitschy cute avocado host stand and even cactus throw pillows, but then theres this really nicely build wall of shelves....with just random \"Mexican\" nick nacks all over it? I feel like I didn't really fit the vibe and was kind of weird. Whatever. Good food and drinks still. I'll come back. Good job!"}
{"text":"We Went there because they advertise that they are open until 12am. Got there at 10pm tonight and a server told us they were closed?? Not off to a great start!  Why advertise across all social media platforms (Google included) that you're open until midnight only to tell customers that you're closed at 10pm? I'm confused. Are they open till 12am, or are the hours of operation online wrong? Or, did they close because it was slow? Having been in the restaurant business for many years, consistency is key! Note to owners, if staff closes the restaurant when they want to (or if hours online don't reflect hours of operation), that is a kiss of death. This is terrible, especially for a brand new place. They need to build a customer base, not turn customers away. We probably won't be back because of this."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday evening for a birthday dinner with a group of friends. Had a large area on the patio to ourselves for the group. Ambiance of the restaurant is very nice and as the weather cools, the patio is perfect. I loved the bingo dabber concept for the create your own guacamole. Lots of variety to customize it as you like. Food was delicious as we had a variety of tacos. Tons of tequila choices too and various flavored margaritas."}
{"text":"The food was good, but over priced, Their house margarita came and I was not impressed. The salsa was great, the servers gave no insight that the food was meant to be shared. The taco menu are described so you have to know what the Mexican ingredients are.  The atmosphere is very cool, up scale furnishings. Too loud, if it was cooler we would have ate outside to avoid the noise of the restaurant. The mix of upscale furnishings and Music is compromised by the sports playing on the TV's, they need to decide if they are a sports bar, or trendy Mexican experience."}
{"text":"I came to Casa A√±ejo with my family a couple times. We always enjoyed the food and the service was good too. 

I decided to write today because my service and dining experience was EXCEPTIONAL. 

Our waitress Abby R. was the absolute best server I've had at Casa A√±ejo. 

We told her exactly what we wanted and she made sure that everything was perfect. It literally was PERFECT and I know it's because of her.

Thank you Abby for the exquisite service and thank you Casa A√±ejo for the incredible food and drinks!

My tip would be to order the mango margarita and anything they serve. Everything is delicious"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great waitress named Kat helped us navigate through our first visit. I highly recommend this place for girls night or date night."}
{"text":"I have no problem with all the new \"trendy\" Mexican restaurants that try and upscale the menus into something creative and distinctive, however Casa A√±ejo just doesn't get it right. The food we ordered, Guacamole, Chicharrones, and Wood Fired Tlayuda, lacked the flavor of authentic Mexican cooking. Tasted like someone trained in a different cuisine trying too hard. How you mess up Guacamole is beyond me. Even the tortilla chips were flavorless. The main dish, Machaca Tacos were a little better but only slightly. If you have ever eaten real Machaca and you understand how complicated and timely the preparation is, it makes you wonder why restaurants such as this one, even try if they aren't going to go all the way. Head south to Tucson to restaurants such as El Charro or even El Minuto, and you find out what a wonderful dish Machaca can really be if done right. At Casa A√±ejo it's little more than shredded beef. 
The place is beautiful inside and the service was  friendly. So it makes me feel bad for the workers to post such a low score, but after all, for a restaurant it all comes down to the food. If I ever came back, it might be to have a drink at the bar because the atmosphere is really nice and the interior and outside patio are beautifully decorated."}
{"text":"Definitely liked the ambience

Margaritas were a bit in the sweet side

The chips were good but the salsa was too sugary (please reduce sugar, we do not want diabetes!)

Service was ok aside from getting stared down by the manager and 6 other waiters the entire time we were sitting in the patio 

Not even going to comment on the entree

True churros are not served here. We drove 30 minutes for fake churros :( 

Music was on point though"}
{"text":"Service at the bar was non existent. Good Mexican beer selection; green chile queso was good. Over priced. Will try again but will sit at a table instead."}
{"text":"Omg everything was amazing to start the drink we got i believe was called la paloma it comes in a very nice jarrito was really good we also ordered the machaca nachos they were full of meat and guac we also got the queso fundido which was delish i also tried the potatoe empanadas and that was very good the sauce was a little spicy but im not to good with spicy food and to finish the night I tried the churros the churro by it self was good the toppings werent that great it would of gone better with like a traditional cajeta or lechera over all cant wait to take my husband the food has that Mexican home made food which we like"}
{"text":"I was waiting for the weather to cool down so I could enjoy the patio. 
I arrived at 11am on Sunday 11/12, sat at 2 different tables in hopes that  someone would come ask me if I wanted a drink or to take my order so 10 minutes later 1 of the servers finally stopped by my table.  It was puzzling because there was 1 table with 3 girls and 2 girls sitting at the bar and there seemed to be sufficient staff with a bartender and 2 staff members roaming around, so who knows why it took so long for someone to talk to me.  The bloodymary was OK and we ordered the grilled fish and baja tacos.  The fish was dry and fishy and the baja was just fair, nothing to write home about.  The only thing that was amazingly delicious was the guacamole.  I would only return to snack on that and that's about it.  There are so many amazing restaurants in our area that I was expecting a bit more from this place and I really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place but it was bad! Beautiful atmosphere, strong drinks but small.No big luscious salted margarita to be found! Not what I expected. Overpriced! Service was decent but slow! If you want a great hot plate of mexican food with rice & beans you will not find that here! Food was not  good. Cactus on the tables were fake...food felt fake as well..I call them like I see them!"}
{"text":"Great place for drinks with friends and good happy hour. Will definatly be back with other friends and hopefully sit on the patio. Server was friendly and attentive to our group. Happy hour is 3 tacos for $8 and you can mix and match."}
{"text":"Very disappointed !!!

We went there because the place is very inviting. They did a very good job on creating an nice atmosphere, that cost them a pretty penny no doubt. The house margarita is $10 and its in a small glass filled with ice,
I personally find that insulting! They do not offer a basket of complimentary chips, I think most Mexican restaurants do! I had the steak fajita, it was a little tough and chewy and too small a portion.
It's the first time I've ever left a Mexican restaurant sober and hungry!
When I got home I had something to eat!!!"}
{"text":"Decent food, but I had to share my 1st experience with annoying flies all over table and food, all while sitting indoors. If you going to have open restaurant cocnept have something to prevent flies from taking over customer table and area, guess they trying to give you authentic street food feel with the flies. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town, very good margaritas and tacos. I would recommend the Doble Tacos, they are one of the best tacos I have ever had! Great place."}
{"text":"Food and drinks on point  Servers were nice. Nice and chilly inside which is perfect with Arizonas dreadful heat. Nice setting. Cute patio. What else do I need to say? Right!"}
{"text":"Great, great, (great!) happy hour...they get it...a happy hour menu to bring people in and have them come back...the drinks are solid, the staff is GREAT. Always attentive and willing to answer questions.

The food has some hits and misses...the 'hot' sauce didn't leave me seeking a glass of water.  The guacamole is solid..the tacos are standard fare. To get into the weeds, the chicken meat was a little dry, but the carnitas was on point.  

I haven't had a full dinner here, but I've been back several times to the bar area..each time walking away happy. 

Good place to take folks new to the area..or maybe wanting a different vibe (think, non-THE YARD) when you want to unwind for a drink."}
{"text":"I had my hopes up for a new spot to move into my neighborhood. I didn't get a chance to eat the food nor drink the cocktails, but I can say that I will never go back to this establishment. The service was so awful that I never write reviews, but I feel compelled to right this. The bar was packed so I waited for a bar height table. The customers left and I took over their table, several severs walked by me and slowly brought me cups, napkins and utensils but no menu. I picked up a menu and the bar, signifying that I was ready to order. A new server came over about 20 minutes later and told me that he's sorry that the table was reserved. First off, if the table was reserved, there should be a sign clearly stating that it's reserved, when I specifically ask if the bar is open seating. The \"reserved\" table was in the bar. Secondly, I have never had such slow and clueless servers in my life. Side note: I was a server for years and understand that there are hiccups but this experience was inexcusable. After essentially being told to leave, I walked down the street (in 115 degree heat) to another bar less than 1 block away. 
Note to the owners: it's great that you have good reviews about your food, this will bring people in, but a good experience will keep them coming back.
Will I be back to casa anejo? Probably not."}
{"text":"I'm only giving them two stars because the drinks were good and the build your own guacamole idea was super cute.  I ordered the doble tacos which the server recommended and said they were the most popular. They were so disappointing and a waste of calories.  They are basically a crunchy taco wrapped in a flour tortilla. The worst part came when I took a bite and it was ground beef! Wow was I shocked! For the all the hype I was definitely disappointed.  I will probably never go back.  My friend forgot her wallet and we came back for it. The manager then told her that one of our cards declined and we still owed $25, which was not true.  Come to find out the server ended up pocketing the cash we left to cover what was left and told the manager we didn't pay it."}
{"text":"Well done decor. However, food in my opinion is a fail. I had much better Mexican food at other places. Ceviche was not my favorite. The best part of my experience there was an avocado greeter table at the entrance."}
{"text":"Attractive space but horrible service. Drinks took 15 minutes for both rounds, we ordered appetizers that cam
e out before the drinks did, then the waiter never came back to take our dinner order so we asked for the check. That took about 10 minutes and then he didn't come back to take our credit cards so I took the bill inside to the hostess. For me, service makes or breaks a restaurant so I won't be going back to this one."}
{"text":"I went there on opening day.  It was pretty crowded.  We ended up seating by the guacamole bar, which was very entertaining to watch.  I understand there are always kinks to work out, but overall we had a good time.  The tacos are indeed tiny, but they were very good.  We also had the guacamole and the street corn, that was delicious.  I had a couple of different margaritas, the traditional was my favorite.  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I liked Casa Anejo mainly for the beautiful decor, ambiance and the drinks. 

For appetizers, we ordered the street corn which came in a bowl. It was good. I liked how it had tiny pieces of fritos in it. It was probably my favorite out of everything we ordered. The chips and salsa were decent, nothing special. For my main dish, I ordered the ribeye steak. It was okay but it was definitely a small serving and not worth the money. Everyone else ordered tacos and unfortunately, no one was impressed.

Our server was fantastic. Prepare to spend a little more though - between the ten of us, our bill was $1000 and we came out of there unsatisfied. Over all, I'd probably come back to have some drinks at their beautiful patio but that's about it."}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices on their margaritas! $5 for a normally $12 drink. The food we had was delicious. Server wasn't super friendly but maybe she was having an off day. We've just been once so definitely a place I would go back."}
{"text":"Excited to go to Casa for the first time with two friends. Checked in with hostess. Twenty minute wait. Understandable for a Friday evening. Stood at the bar for 15-20 minutes with no one asking if we wanted a drink. I even raised my hand jokingly in the air to get some attention. Several bartenders buzzing about but not one acknowledged us. Finally decided to leave the restaurant. Shared our story with the hostess. She was apologetic but it was too late to want to stay and enjoy dinner. Will never return! You only get one chance to make a first impression. Why go back when there are so many other places to go? I think the 7th Street restaurant thing is starting to be a victim of its own success. Diners want to go to a restaurant for good food and respectable service not a night club where self-important staff can treat you like a shadowy figure on the other side of the bar."}
{"text":"Love the music! AMAZING VIBE! GREAT service! Staff is very knowledgeable with the menu I love that!  I will return with friends a great experience!"}
{"text":"The tacos here are delicious. The drink are wonderful. Real margaritas. Authentic martini pour margaritas. Tequila forward. Not a from the bottle mix that is too sweet and generic. Jesse can make an excellent margarita. If you like Blanco Taco and Tequila you should give this place a try."}
{"text":"I hate tacos, said no juan ever! Atmosphere was great and service was on point. Let's taco about the food. Nachos were BOMB! Get them. Prices are decent $10-$12 for 3 street size tacos, unless you get the doble (corn+flour tortilla) those were massive and super filling. My husband was in Taco Bell heaven. I'm not a huge ground beef fan at restaurants, but they were pretty dang tasty with great flavor. I got the machaca tacos. They had a good portion of meat but they were pretty dry. I asked the server for salsa and once I added it, they were much better. Cocktails were better than expected considering reviews sucked. I got the kiwi Margarita which was the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. Overall, I would say it was a solid experience and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best tacos, nachos, margaritas and vibe out of any Mexican restaurant I've been to! Coming back this weekend to check out brunch- so stoked! Thanks for adding this gem to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Wow - what a fun new place on the 7th Street restaurant corridor!  We made a reservation last night and stopped in for dinner.  Beautiful decor, lively atmosphere (although the bass in the music was overwhelming), great service and delicious food.  We both started with a cider and a beer and then split the bean burrito, carne asada tacos, cilantro rice and black beans.  We sat inside this time, but definitely will come back for a patio seat next time."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointing experience for Sunday brunch and first visit.   First, hostess recommends dining at the bar because only 2 food servers available so dining room food service would be slow. No problem, we are fine eating at the bar, meet other people, watch soccer.  We order bloody Mary's, which are different but very good.  We order chilaquiles and the machaca scramble.  Both were bland and lacking in even a mild spicy flavor.  The machaca dish was overloaded with potatoes, very poor balance between meat and veggies.  The chilaquiles were the worst I've ever had.  Something called whipped eggs were scrambled and hidden below the tortillas. The sauce was non existent and when I asked for salsa was asked if I wanted the kitchen to prepare some for me or Cholula. Really, they don't have salsa prepared in the kitchen to just bring out? I just used the bottled salsa, fearing the house made would be no better than our entrees.  So, after listening to loud obnoxious music, I asked the bartender, so this is a Mexican restaurant, why aren't you playing Mexican music? He responded this was a Mexican \"themed\" restaurant and the music is selected by the manager, it changes throughout the day and sometimes they play Mexican type music and even have mariachis.  There is a wide range of Latin music available and if you are going to present yourself as a Mexican themed restaurant the food and music ought to support the theme.  The space is beautiful and the staff was very efficient and knowledgeable.  I hope for the sake of their continued employment management works on the quality of food."}
{"text":"Make sure before you plan on coming here to check to see if its a friends and family night. You could literally arrive and walk in with no sign and think the establishment is open and 15 minutes later find out you have to leave. Awful customer service"}
{"text":"Food is good, but whatever you do, don't sit at the bar.  The service has been terrible on multiple occasions."}
{"text":"Two bad experiences. 

Very mediocre food. Very expensive. 

50/50 on service. Today our party received wonderful service. The first time was awful. 

I hope our server today finds a different restaurant soon, I hate to see him go down with this ship."}
{"text":"Sneaky Upsale. We thought we were having Happy Hour Margaritas for $5 per the menu that states All Margarita's $5.  The server asked us what kind of tequila we wanted  and we said we didn't care, she made a suggestion and we said ok, Not knowing when we received our bill, the margarita's were $15.00 each.  Otherwise ambiance is very cute, food is very tasteful.  But make sure you're getting margarita happy hour prices on drinks."}
{"text":"The margaritas were probably the worst I have ever had and after switching to sangria it didn't get any better. The food was pretty good, I had the calamari which was authentic and I loved whatever sauce came with it. Service was subpar"}
{"text":"Best Guacamole ever! We had an amazing dinner at Casa Anejo! The wait time was between 30-45 minutes but they got us pretty fast. Love the decor and the beautiful patio area. The waiter was super friendly and very attentive. My son had the Sonoran Hotdog which he loved and I had the Roadside pollo which I highly recommend! We live about 60 miles away but definitely worth the drive. I will be back on Tuesday for \"Taco Tuesday\"!"}
{"text":"I think the vibe is cool on a saturday after 8pm. Dj was fun with upbeat bass jams. Food was good but not for the price. Again it was delicious but i think guac is over priced for how much they served you as well As the mango margarita. The food came very very fast but we were kind of on a time crunch to meet other friends. Service was good. If they adjust their prices ... I would come back or try their happy hour"}
{"text":"First time...  had Dave as our server AHHHHMAZING! best carne asada EVER , baja,and carnitas tacos delicious! Street corn on point, drinks -blackberry basil, hibiscus margarita, and the Eastwood delicious!!!!! Ambiance cool, comfy, service impeccable my new favorite spot. Ask for Dave he will take excellent care of you. Only downside churros were raw..Can't wait to go back, definately celebrating my birthday there 

Update 
Invited 60 FB friends to join me for Taco Tuesday 9 came. It was thier first time too. Everything was on point again. I tried two new tacos, octopus and veggie. Delicious!!! especially the octopus. Tried guacamole too delicious. We gave the churros another chance... same issue. Let's get something else on the menu for dessert that is keeping you from 5 stars! 

Until next time amigos!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is that it's horrible service. The female bartender chatted the entire time with fellow employees. Food was delicious. Thank goodness for the bartender from Boston. He had great personality and made us feel welcomed."}
{"text":"So.... This is my 4th visit to this place... Love the atmosphere.....2 of 4 visits... Where good.... Drinks... excellent the first 3 times... Tonight really bad.....I used to bartend and whoever is here tonight is....an amateur... Bad mixing.... The customer service lacks a bit.....server seems to have too many tables to be able to give enough attention to his customers... It took way too long to check on us after the food was served and after the drinks.. Which took way too long to be served in the first place....... btw the server multiple times failed to pick up plates we literally sat till the end... As I'm writing this.... With every dish and glass we where served..... They need to polish their service....."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place you would come for the vibe, not the food. The space is awesome, the patio is great and they serve good drinks. The food is nothing more than average. There were three of us and we wanted tacos. There are so many great places in Phoenix for street tacos and this is not one of them. The tacos come three to an order, but you can't mix and match. We ordered three different types, but were disappointed as none of them were a flavorful as we would have hoped. I was told the place is pretty new, so hopefully the food quality will improve. The prices were reasonable and the service was good. I would probably come back for drinks, but not necessarily for dinner."}
{"text":"I am disgusted at how this restaurant is run. It has only been open for a few weeks and I feel that this is a really delicate time for a new business, when they should be working hard to gain a good following. However, what they are doing is actively working to drive customers away and totally drive the business into the ground. 

If you don't want to read my long review: 
The management here doesn't care about patrons and will inappropriately argue with and curse at you. Reservations mean nothing and they will always find a reason not to seat you. Go next door to Stock and Stable; It is a wonderful place and they deserve your money. 

Here's the facts: 

I called the minute they opened on a Saturday morning to make reservations for that night at 6pm. I requested a table indoors for four people. I had guests in town and I wanted to show them a good time at a cool new spot. 

Fast forward to 5:30pm. I arrive at the restaurant to check in for my reservation. Hostesses told me I was too early and I had to wait. Understood, I just wanted to be on time for my reservation. There isn't anywhere to stand or wait in the entry so I had to sit at the bar which was already completely full except for one chair. I don't mind waiting for a table at all but it's not a bad idea to give me somewhere to actually be while I wait. 

Thirty minutes pass and my party had arrived and we all stood awkwardly alongside the others that had nowhere to wait. A host comes over and let's us know we are being seated outside. Please note the date we were there was Saturday, June 24th, 2017 and the current temperature at 6pm was 115. I confirmed with him that I had indeed requested a table inside. I let him know that I'm sorry if there was confusion but we needed to be indoors and we would be glad to wait a bit more for a different table. He walked away without a word. 

Ten more minutes pass and we are still standing near the bar with the ever growing crowd of people who don't have anywhere to wait either. No one returned in that time to let me know the status of my table. I asked the bartender if we could speak to a manager to hopefully get it sorted out. He pointed to a man and said he thought it was the manager but it was said managers first day. The manager came over and curtly announced that we could sit outdoors in the heat or that we could leave. 

I explained again to him that we were not interested in outdoor seating, but we would be happy to wait for the next available table indoors. During the time of this argument, four indoor tables had opened up but were not seated with anyone. The conversation continued with the assistant manager stating to \"sit outside or please fucking leave.\" He denied us our request of waiting longer for another table and said we are not allowed to sit in them. He did not offer any solutions or customer service gestures. We weren't allowed to sit indoors although I had called earlier to make a reservation for inside. Clearly the reservation system does not matter as this is treated like an elitist nightclub experience of some sort. 

We left after the manager stated that \"I don't have any power to help you.\" A small gesture such as offering to buy us a drink or a free appetizer would have gone a long way to smooth over the situation. I find it both offensive and absolutely comical the way that their management behaves. I chose to ignore all of the other terrible reviews on this place because I know new restaurants hit some speed bumps along the way. This behavior is inexcusable. Your customers are what make you or break you at this stage. Casa A√±ejo does not care about the happiness of their guests. I don't expect for this restaurant to remain open for long if this is how management is to behave. I look forward to trying the next restaurant that opens up in this space when Casa A√±ejo closes down very soon.  

Let it be noted that we went next door to Stock and Stable. The food and service was wonderful and next time you find yourself wanting a good time, make sure to stay out of Casa A√±ejo and just walk next door to Stock and Stable. They care about their guests and try hard to make you happy."}
{"text":"There isn't a Mexican restaurant in the valley that has such a fun atmosphere (live Dj) with legit and delicious food! I haven't had an item here that isn't mouth watering. The guacamole is truly the best I've had in my life. Be careful with the margaritas, they'll knock your socks off (in a good way)!"}
{"text":"The only reason why this place gets a five star is because of the bar tender HOLLY and GM Rubin!  The male bar tenders are subpar!  Drinks are great, food delicious, atmosphere is great!  When you come ask for HOLLY the bar tender"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! Went there for happy hour and they have the really good margaritas for $5. I had the mango and watermelon. I ordered the chicken quesadilla which didn't look like what you envision it to look... looked more like a Mexican pizza but it was delish. The bartenders Michael, Sal and Jeremy were AWESOME! Definitely will be back. It also had a cool ambiance."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Casa Anejo on it's first night open to the public. After drooling over photo after photo of their food on Instagram, we were really jazzed to go check it out. Opening night always has its drawbacks, usually service related. But that's ok, we were there for the food. So, I won't talk about the service as it was fine and I'm sure will improve with time. The food is what disappointed. 

Since we were planning on hitting up another spot after Casa Anejo, we decided to share just a couple of things: chorizo & papas, and the machaca nachos. (As a side note from a consistency fan, the menu was annoying because it vacillated between \"&,\" \"and,\" and \"y\" to describe various dishes. Please, just pick one and stick to it!) No, we did not order tacos. Tacos are a schtick that new restaurants cling to for who knows what reason. If you want good tacos, go to Tacos Chiwas. End of tacos story. 

Back to Casa Anejo's food. The chorizo & papas dish was lacking flavor... Which was almost mind boggling considering the variety of veggies and the fact that it had *chorizo*. We gave up on eating it because salting every bite became weird. (Another side note, awesome salt and pepper shakers!)

The nachos... those poor nachos. There were many things wrong. First, the guacamole on top was going bad. It was opening night, how was it going bad?! You could tell by both the flavor and color. Yick. Second, there were probably five clumps of shredded beef (machaca) sprinkled on top. And it was dry and crispy. Five pieces and it's part of the name?! Shameful. Third, the toppings were just that, toppings; nothing was spread amongst the layers of chips. There were random clumps of beans, maybe six pickled jalape√±os, and I barely remember the tomatillo. Finally, and worst of all, there was no queso. You read correctly, no queso. WTF?! We were so hungry by the time we got our food that we didn't realize it until the end. No queso. Ridiculous. 

The restaurant is beautiful. The decor is awesome. But I don't think I'll go back just because it looks nice. (Also, note for the owners, bigger water glasses would be great!)"}
{"text":"In a city of amazing Mexican restaurants, don't waste time or money here. Their tacos are served in a minimalistic fashion; i.e., chicken is just that on a lukewarm street tortilla, no cabbage, no sauce, and pretty tasteless. I ordered the \"veggie\" taco, which was a fried relleno popper (filled with cheese) on a tortilla. It had a little heat, but was basically a lame appetizer slapped on a tortilla. I didn't eat more than one of the 3 that comes w/ the order. To their credit,  the tacos were removed from our ticket. My partner ordered an entree burrito, which was large ($12), and added a protein, chicken for $6. It was not worth half that price, the burrito beans tasted like canned beans. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"We were a party of 10. Nice restaurant. Service was good. House guacamole and chips were just ok. Because the music was extremely loud, It was difficult to talk to friends and it gave me a headache. Too noisy. Not at all enjoyable. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Not exactly sure what the concept is here.  Bad music blaring, way too loud for an empty restaurant.  Service was slow and the food was incredibly bad.  On the good side, cheap drink specials.  Being from LA its funny seeing restaurants like this try so hard to be trendy, but cannot achieve the basics = good food, good service.  I give it until summer, 7th street is saturated."}
{"text":"Casa Anejo is such a great addition to the area. I went here last night for some drinks after a long day of work. I love that the hostess stand at the entrance is a giant avocado. The rest of the d√©cor was casual but sophisticated. We grabbed a seat at the bar and were promptly greeted by the bartender. I started with the Kiwi Margarita {blanco tequila | kiwi | jalapeno | lime} you can't go wrong with muddled jalapeno and this drink went down a little too easily. My amigo ordered the house marg and she was a big fan. Their chips and salsa comes with tomatillo (medium), poblano (mild), and habanero (HOT!) I will definitely be back for dinner soon so I can update this review."}
{"text":"As a former server I try not to be hypercritical of the service, but gurl. This may the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. 

We were sitting by the bar and it took 20 minutes to get a drink. Wouldn't matter normally; however, that coupled with soggy food, and a snarky bartender when I simply asked what he made. Made this rating."}
{"text":"Me and my best friend were going to go to The Yard and the parking was confusing so we turned into the next possible parking lot and we saw Casa A√±ejo and they said they had happy hour from 3-6pm daily. So we decided to sit at he bar and Sav (Salvador) was my bartender and he was nothing but amazing service. They have an amazing happy hour and good vibes plus the resturant itself is beautiful , definitely recommend this resturant if you're in the area! Sal works wed-sat so hopefully you get him!"}
{"text":"So so restaurant...guacamole was very good. We added bacon, pomegranates and pepitas. Two out of four salsas were decent. You have to pay for chips and salsa. I had the market fish which lacked flavor and doesn't include any sides. My husband had the chorizo pancakes. Sounds interesting but chorizo and syrup really doesn't work. Pretty average food. Biggest problem was service was so slow. We waited 20 minutes before our server took our drink order. He was split inside and outside so that may have had something to do with it. The other major issue was the flies. There was an uncomfortable number of flies all of the restaurant. Kind of grossed me out and having to constantly swat flies away from my meal was annoying. Fun to try something new but probably won't be recommending until they work their kinks out."}
{"text":"Amazing unique margaritas! The tacos were amazing. We had a chorizo, carne Asada, and beef tacos. Chorizo is hot but delicious."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time last night. The atmosphere is really chill and the decor is on point. However I can't say the same about the food. The food was very basic and over priced for what you actually got, not to mention having a very limited menu. 

I ordered the carne asada tacos. The meat was tender which I enjoyed, however it was very bland. A side of salsa was required to make the tacos less dry and more tastier. We also ordered the bean burrito and added chicken ($6) and literally received maybe 4 strips of chicken in total. 

This place was cool to check out and experience once however I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been driving by for weeks waiting for this place to open and am excited to report it was worth the wait!! The street corn was amazing and I definitely recommend the carne asada tacos and create your own guacamole bar. Also, this hibiscus margarita was delish!!!"}
{"text":"This was place was just alright for me. The atmosphere and cocktails are the star, not the food. I highly recommend coming to this place at happy hour and because the of the lively bar scene, its probably a great place to catch a sporting event. Pretty sure they get a DJ in there on weekends and I would definitely like to come back for brunch. The service was great (our server very kindly tolerated us as some of the party proceeded to get margarita rowdy). I'd like to come back and try different items too."}
{"text":"I think we've found one of our go to restaurants. The atmosphere is chic and whoever was in charge of the decor did an amazing job. Not only the decor, but also the DJ did a great job adding to the experience. It doesn't stop there, the service was fast, but we didn't feel rushed. The food was delicious and the portions were beyond adequate. And our margaritas had a nice balance of sweet and anejo tequila, not too strong nor too weak."}
{"text":"First time visit and the drinks were over the top ! The half off everyday until 6 made the prices for the  house margarita appealing! Thanks for the good pours on the tequila ! The salsa dips were a nice touch and the octopus tacos was my first and yes it tastes like fish lol! Lastly the sipping tequila blanco a√±ejo was strong as heck but a nice sipping drink ! Keep it up and the music made the experience Iive !"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We sat at the bar and Mike helped us! He was great and made everyone feel special. He was on top of everything we need. The atmosphere is amazing- they have a DJ every day! The food was amazing and the drinks the same! I'd definitely recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks are amazing stunning atmosphere great job guys but the best is the DJ! I think his name is DJ heartbreak freaking incredible we will come every Saturday night to listen to this guy"}
{"text":"My 1st visit at this restaurant and it was great. My friend and I were immediately greeted by the hostess and brought to a high table towards the back wall. I immediately noticed the decor and absolutely loved it. Our waitress came over to us pretty quickly and we hit it off. She had a great personality, was fun to joke with and was very knowledgeable of the different types of tequila offered. She was also great with helping us pick a starter and helping us choose our entrees. (Her name is Kat and it was her 1st day!) My friend and I shared the chips and salsa and also tried the street corn. I highly recommend the street corn. It was awesome with the chips. For dinner, I ordered the carnitas but had them add pickled jalapenos and removed the pickled onions. They were great. Good portion size. My friend ordered green chili pork which came with tortillas. She said it was awesome. We each had 2 drinks, tried different stuff. I can't remember the names or what tequila we went with but I wasn't disappointed. I plan on going back with my boyfriend as we love eating out and this was a great experience."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is good- the food is not.  Probably excellent for happy hour however I went hungry for lunch and was not impressed with the food.  Queso dip tasted very processed- for the price I expected much more."}
{"text":"This place was slammed but we had a reservation for 14. Seated right away. Everything was A+++

Highlights: 

Tequila list is impressive. One of the best in PHX. Some Mezcals you can't get anywhere. 

Jesse was fantastic as a server, handled our semi high maintenance table with ease. 

Ceviche and Queso Fundido as great plates to start. 

Pork entree with Green Chile is a must. 

Design is great, vibe is great, some may say music is too loud but it fits this space. 

Way better than Joyride. 

Excited to come back."}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere. BUT first, the menus were wrong, we got one saying Happy Hour was everyday and another one saying Happy Hour was M-F, ordered guacamole that took FOREVER! They had to get pomegranate seeds from next door, and then when the guac came out it was missing the pumpkin seeds I ordered. Asked for cotija cheese on my guac and they swear it was cotija but I'm almost 99.9% it was fresco....They didn't have Mexicali Pilsner which was in the menu :/, no Chambord to top my margarita. Overstaffed, with everyone standing around in the kitchen, therefore I don't understand how orders come out wrong? Live DJ helps liven up the atmosphere! Would given them another try during the week, but based off of first impression.....not too impressed..."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what's up with all the bad reviews. I've been here twice and it was great! First time for lunch with a coworker after it initially opened, and second time for happy hour dinner and drinks with a friend. Both visits the service and food was amazing, it also has a really nice decor. 

I'm disappointed I didn't take pictures of my food to share, but it looked so delicious I just dug right in! On my first visit I ordered the chorizo doble tacos and arroz blanco (basically cilantro rice). Second visit, the green chili pork entr√©e and we shared an order of the sweet corn which was really good with their chips. I had chips and salsa on both visits and they bring out a salsa sampler. The first visit there was a super hot one that is no longer provided, but they do still have it if you're into crazy hot salsa. I personally like to keep my taste buds! They have probably the biggest menu of tequila I've ever seen and our waitress, Kat, was very knowledgeable in helping us decide which one to choose for our margaritas. Speaking of Kat, she's freaking awesome! Super cool personality and very attentive... she also bartends! She informed us they'll be opening up the patio and having a DJ on the weekends, so if you're in the area give it a try! If you're a previous bad reviewer come back, give it another chance, and ask for Kat!"}
{"text":"I definitely liked the atmosphere. I went yesterday for Sunday Funday and they have a dj so it makes the ambience pretty fun. They have a great selection of tequila and beer but the one thing I dislike was the food we ordered a ceviche and it tasted hideous, also we ordered a guacamole with cotija cheese and they gave us fresco instead and when I told the waiter he said it was cotija and they went to get the pomegranate next door. I will give this place another try during the week"}
{"text":"Great place, awesome staff, nice drinks and live dj music.  Carnitas tacos are the best, I also love the fish tacos and the carne asada tacos have a nice smoky taste.  

One of the best places to get guacamole because you could add things like bacon, pop rocks, crab to make it unique."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice. Patio seating is the way to go. Food was delicious. Really loved the custom guac. Mango margarita was yummy but a little sweet. Overall I would recommend Casa Anejo, the only reason for the 4 stars in the extremely rude hostess."}
{"text":"Drinks are good, food is not bad, dj can't mix and plays music a little too loud. Not a bad Latin inspired spot!"}
{"text":"I typically like to only write positive reviews on Yelp, and I'm only writing this negative review because nobody responded to the email that I sent to every email address on their website for their management team. The short version of this review is that they make a pretty good cocktail (when they actually make the entire cocktail and not 3/4 of one) and the place is beautiful but the staff and overall experience was terrible and it appears many other Yelpers have had similar experiences. Added the second star because the first round of cocktails were great. 

The long version... The Friday we attended was the Friday prior to Memorial Day on 5-26-17. We met our friends shortly before 10:00 pm, we went late because we had heard that Casa Anejo sells street tacos on their late night menu. When we arrived there were about 20-30 customers and the cook appeared to be preparing the outdoor kitchen for the tacos. My first impression was that the restaurant was beautiful and had a great layout. My wife and I both enjoy tequila cocktails and we're excited when looking at the cocktail menu, I ended up ordering the Hibiscus margarita and my wife the watermelon margarita. We both enjoyed our drinks.  Around 10:30 I overhear the staff discussing shutting down early. At this point we were not getting much attention from the bartenders but when we finally did we ordered another round because we did enjoy our drinks. At this point much of the staff became more concerned with cleaning and shutting the restaurant down, this was very off-putting as it wasn't even 11 yet and it looked more like a bar at 2:30 am the way the they were cleaning.  When we received our second round it was like we had received completely different drinks.  Our first round there was much effort put into the presentation of the cocktails with a hibiscus flower garnishing my drink and watermelon in my wife's drink.  Our second round had no flower or watermelon, and my wife's cocktail was at least 2-3 finger widths short of being a full cocktail. Again while all of this happening the staff is more concerned with cleaning, and this included the outdoor grill so no tacos for us. While drinking our second round two more groups of customers had arrived and were turned away because the staff said they were closing early. What I found shocking was one of the groups was a group of females in their 20s, and the staff actually told them to \"head over to Honor Much Amongst Thieves, you'll like it there\".  I would think that this type of clientele is exactly the customer base Casa A√±ejo would target, but yet their staff is telling them to go to another bar.  Our group was stunned that this happened and just decided to ask for the check, which took some time because again the staff was more concerned with cleaning than paying any sort of attention to the remaining customers. Our group decided to head to Honor Amongst Thieves since that is quickly becoming one of our favorite bars, and with Casa Anejo right next door I thought they would become part of the regular rotation of bars we frequent.  Sadly that will not happen, and based off of our first experience we do not plan on returning to Casa Anejo. There's a lot of competition on 7th street and Casa A√±ejo isn't trying very hard  to compete for your business which is disappointing because it's obvious a lot of money was spent to open this place up."}
{"text":"Too bad this place closed. We went one time shortly after they first opened and thought it was decent. Tacos great, steak burrito was a little much, guac and chips outstanding."}
{"text":"This place cares more about its \"vibe\" than its customers. When it was clear we were going to leave because we couldn't hear each other, the server told us they'd turn down the music. They did. Then when our food came, they turned it back up. The food is mediocre...not worth the attitude and aggravation."}
{"text":"So this place is cute and the food is delicious! I definitely recommend the enchiladas they were flavorful with just the right amount of spice. I couldn't try the cocktails due to being preggo but they made me a delicious mocktail! They only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars is their salsa wasn't great it was okay and they charge you for chips and salsa . Otherwise, this was a very good experience and I would recommend this spot"}
{"text":"Mid century southwest decor, fantastic service and amazing happy hour - $5 drafts + margaritas (all options)."}
{"text":"I came here several weeks ago and thoroughly enjoyed my time here ! The service was good as the staff was attentive but not \"too attentive\" if you catch my drift..
Their happy hour is amazing, you should come and sample it and see for yourself! Their guacamole and salsas are all phenomenal, different than other places nearby. 
The food was tasty but the CHURROS were a home run!! They are better than the ones in Disneyland! They come with three dipping sauces so they cater to different taste buds. They had chocolate, strawberry and pineapple dipping sauce! All of which were great!! 
We came on a night that wasn't busy, but I know on a weekend or Friday night it would be hard to park, so keep that in mind!
Give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try Casa Anejo as it's only two blocks from my house, and my girlfriend and I are obsessed with tacos. She and I went once together, and she won't come back. I tried it a second time with my mom (in from out of town), and I would only ever come back for a drink, not the food.

1) You can tell a lot about a place from its chips and salsa. Chips are on point. Salsa? Not good. In fact, the second time I went, I didn't even bother to order it. And I'm obsessed with chips & salsa, so that should tell you enough, but alas, there's more...

2) The second time we ordered the guacamole. Yes, it's cute that I can order pop rocks in my guac, but WHY? I would pass over the overpriced guac any day.

3) The street corn is in fact NOT street corn. It's bagged frozen corn (off the cob) that's tossed with a bunch of stuff, chili fritos included. It just tastes like a processed bowl of food stuff. So that's the third appetizer out the window.

4) Now for entrees...I've had the chicken tacos twice. The were the only thing worth reordering, but even they are meh. Average. Not worth dropping money on more than twice. I can name off at least five other places that serve better tacos at a cheaper price. If you want tacos, go to one of those places and save yourself some $.

5) The decor and ambiance of the location are cool, which is why I would return for a drink or two. (Again, NOT the food.) BUT they blast the music and it's nearly impossible to hear, so basically if I came there only to drink and can't even hear the person next to me, then I might as well come drink by myself.....but if I really want to drink alone, I can do that at home for less money. (My house is well decorated and the music is on point.)

6) And now for the service...The service is meh. My girlfriend and I arrived the first time at 9:50 pm, 10 minutes before the kitchen closed. We were rushed to the bar and told to order as quickly as possible. We did but apparently ordering chips and salsa caused an uproar in the kitchen and strings had to be pulled to get us chips & salsa. What?! The second time we arrived at the end of happy hour and it's a slower night (it was a Tuesday), and our waiter periodically dropped by but there was a lot of downtime waiting.

I really can't underscore enough how disappointed I was. The moral of all of this is go grab a drink at the bar but any more than that and you may be disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened up on seventh Street... Lots of competition as far as restaurants go... But this  seems to be a unique gem with a great tequila selection, amazing salsa sampler, fun and original Decour, lively happy hour...

Service was top notch .... you would never know they had just opened up.

I love the uniforms the hostesses wear and that there is uniformity amounts the waiters and bartenders outfits and look.  (Over the hipster just rolled out of bed w scabs around their nose ring look!!)

Brought my dog Ace our first time and denied.... but promised that they are dog friendly... we will see..."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! They have the BEST guacamole in town. This is my 3rd time here and it never fails to hit the \"spot\" The bartender Michael was so sweet snd helpful w/selections ...and ladies I will be honest he i s beautiful. Come visit this place you won't be disappointed:))"}
{"text":"I was going to give a 3 star but the 2 star generated critique best fit my experience.  

Wait staff was very friendly.  Food came out fast.  Cool idea of build your own guacamole.  

The thing is the food.  It was not bad at all but it was not good.  The flavors just weren't there for me.  Everything I tasted was one note.  They need to build bolder flavors."}
{"text":"Really liked the vibe and the doble tacos were fantastic. I'm knocking them a star though because the service was slow, and they did not refill the tiny water glasses when it was over 100 degrees outside. Fill those glasses up! Fun cocktails, would come back for happy hour"}
{"text":"What can i say we love to try new places and this one is definitely going into my favorites! We were seated right away and our waiter was very lovely. The tacos were not only delicious but filling as well. I recommend getting chips and guac with any meal and to customize your own however you like! We decided to get creative and chose the crab with pomegranate... it was amazing! Don't leave without ordering the churros for dessert! Our waiter says that people like to call them \"fluffy clouds\" and they are! They are served with different dipping sauces and the strawberry creme is to die for! We had a great first experience here and will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!!! Went for Taco Tuesday and made it for happy hour.  They have a great menu.
Only rated 4 stars as service was slow for appetizers and drinks.
Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"While traveling on business I decided to stop here because the menu looked interesting. I ordered Titos, club soda and lime. You can't mess that up. Let me begin by saying I'm from Texas and know good Mexican food, this was not it. Also ordered the Doble taco. It was fairly tasty and different. This is where I should have stopped. I then ordered the Roadside Pollo which left a lot to be desired. The chicken could have been cooked longer and it was a flat out mess with the beans and whatever else was on the plate. I only ate the breast. When I return to the area, I will not stop here again."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were delicious and the atmosphere is fun, but our server Katherine was truly awful. She was slow and unhelpful. It took 15-20 minutes to get cocktails delivered on more than one occasion, our water container frequently ran dry, and she was nowhere to be found when we were ready to order entree's or another round of drinks. She complained to us that she was super hungover from some team building exercise the company held at a club the night before (How unprofessional? I shouldn't have to lower my expectations of the service because you drank too much?). She messed up and forgot orders, and didn't explain anything to those of us who were there for the first time, ie. what's on happy hour, build your own guacamole vs house guacamole, etc. The worst part is that she put everything under one tab (without asking) for a table of eight. And then made us personally separate out the tab because she had no clue who ordered what. We had to tally up who had what, and it was so awkward trying to figure out payment amongst ourselves. It's the servers and not the guest's responsibility to know who ordered what!! It ended up taking over a half an hour to tab out. I would like to highlight that the hostess was friendly, and so were a few other staff members who filled our water for us while our server was absent for prolonged periods of time."}
{"text":"Sit at the bar and have Michael make you drinks! If you want something light, get 2 lemons muddled with vodka and topped with a splash of water. Happy hour 3-6pm; $5 margaritas and well drinks, $5 guacamole, $7 nachos and a few other appetizers. Tacos $9-12 with 3 per order and packed with flavor. Awesome layout with legit outdoor patio space with heaters and misters. Cyclebar opening up next door ..  perfect night in my near future- cycle class followed by Guac and Margs by Michael!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Tequila selection.   The Machaca Nachos are outstanding!!!   I will come back and sit on their huuuge patio!! The street tacos got a big thumbs up from my wife.   The margaritas were fresh and delicious too!!   Would recommend coming on a warm day to enjoy the wrap around patio!!!"}
{"text":"Stoped in this afternoon for taco Tuesday. We were greeted right away and sat at a nice table. The decor of this place is really appealing. It was well thought out and looks very nice. Our server was really friendly and helpful and just did an all around great job. We will be back. Only complaint is you can not mix and match the kind of tacos you want. Seems like everyone around us had the same complaint. The food is really good so it isn't a deal breaker."}
{"text":"#tacotuesdayfail. Really wanted to like this place. You get 3 street size tacos on small corn tortillas for $8. The value is good. All margaritas are $6 (about 6oz). Watermelon was good. Berry hibiscus and lime margaritas were meh. The carnitas taco was hard AF. Like I bit into it and i almost broke a tooth. Even tried shredding it, that didn't work. Waiter was awesome and brought me a chicken taco. Meat was bland. I threw on tons of salsa and lime juice to give it some flavor. Of the 9 tacos we ate, only one was decent (chorizo because it had melted muenster). 

Service was GREAT, atmosphere was super fun, but the food just wasn't cutting it. 

We will try them one more time."}
{"text":"Not a bad experience for the 1st time visit. We got here few min before happy hour was over and it was packed in here, we got a table outside , they only have 3 mister systems outsides that doesn't help at all in AZ heat. We got guacamole and nachos for an appetizer, guacamole was excellent , I could eat it by itself. They have different \" flavor \" margaritas, we tried watermelon , hibiscus, mango and regular house and they all tasted like regular ones, it seems that they only added some color to make them look different. I had octopus tacos, they were great but they use regular tortillas out of bag which defeated all the flavor. I would recommend this place for a happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Unbelievable place! I took my fianc√©, sister and brother in law here Saturday night. We ordered the street corn and guacamole which were fantastic for our appetizers. For our main dish we got the Sonoran dogs and they were incredible. The bacon, beans, crema and other toppings were top notch. The atmosphere of this place is some of the best I've seen for a Mexican restaurant, especially the music and giant avocado reception desk. Overall this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in some time."}
{"text":"Feliz Cinco de Mayo !!! We hit it and went all out for the grand opening day! The crowd was full of anticipation...it was a full house !!! Got cocktails (hints: anything but MARGARITAS) at the bar and...blissfully waiting for our table (hmn...like 2 hours). To be fair, the most delish margaritas kept us with the spirit of the Holiday, on a Friday, and First opening day. Thanks for the two most lovely ladies to sit us within one hour (instead of two hours) -- Yay to Jean (hostess) and Marisol (General Manager). 
We enjoyed our time very much at Casa A√±ejo !!! Nice decors, trendy, 7 street at the Colony, authentic Mex food, and an incredible selection of Margaritas and Tequila (not necessarily in that order). 
We had an amazing time (with the one hours waiting). We will be back !!! 
It's your turn to check it out. 
Kudos and Happy Dining !"}
{"text":"By far one of the most hip taco and tequila restaurants around. Great atmosphere, amazing food, and delicious cocktails.   I will be back again for the carnitas tacos."}
{"text":"This review is for the vegan, vegetarian or gluten intolerant diners. The tortillas are vegan, fried with canola oil and gluten free. 

For dinner I had the 3 braised greens, vegetarian tacos and a side of rice & beans. The black beans are not cooked with meat, but they do top with cheese. The tacos were good, a little salty for my taste but pretty good. They are also topped with cheese but can be omitted for vegans. 

Overall the experience was okay. The dj was a nice touch however, the music was entirely too loud for a Sunday evening crowd. The tacos were small, kinda the size if you were going for tapas. 

I don't see myself returning especially because there are not a lot of choices for vegan/vegetarian people."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Staff were friendly and knowledgeable. The cooks educated me on how they made my dish. Awesome!! I asked for suggestions on the drinks and every drink was on point.  I will definitely be traveling back down to Casa Anejo.  This place is a must if you're in Arizona. The only takeaway I have about this place is they don't ship food to my state."}
{"text":"Pretty Gross, this will be the first of the saturated 7st corridor restaurants to close.

I ordered the chicharrones and I wouldn't have been surprised if I found out that they sent a busboy over to circle k to buy them.

Guacamole was completely bland.

I'll stick to Comedor Guadalajara."}
{"text":"First time here. Food was really good. We had the carne asada tacos 3 for 10. Small green chile pork with 3 small flour tortillas 7. Kids meal nachos around 6. And 3.00 for chips and salsa. 2.oo for drinks which was fine I had a diet soda but my date had carbonated water which places usually don't charge for, nor do they charge for chips and salsa but no biggie. The waitress was Kelsey with mediocre service. No smile, very stoic not very attentive towards end; offered no drink refills. When we left we were met by the door with 3 friendly faces 2 hostesses and a man.  I can appreciate a friendly face and your guests are there for you to service until they leave. It wasn't busy and the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on a sunday afternoon hoping for happy hour. The menu they gave us said Happy Hour Everyday 3-6pm...turns out that's not the case, it's only Monday-Friday. Not a big deal, We asked our bartender for recommendations and he suggested their Jalisco bowl. There were 3 of us and he said it's a lot of booze and will have us feeling tipsy (which it should for $22). It was pretty much all ice, we each got a couple of sips out of it and it was done. It felt like the equivalent to maybe a drink and a half that we shared. Whatever, chalk it up to a bad suggestion. We asked for our check so we could get to somewhere with happy hour. Gave him our cards at 4:45, he disappeared and we got them back at 4:53, and I got charged twice. Sent it back and it took another 3-4 minutes to get it fixed. I gave it 3 stars because they have a really nice restaurant and are new and trying to work out the kinks but we had a pretty bad first experience and probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Just went back to Casa Anejo again after they updated their menu. Not only did they listen to my fiance's and my suggestions but, they updated many other things. We always sit at the bar, and Jeremy and Tyler we're awesome. Tyler has helped us before so it was great to see a friendly face. We tried the updated queso, and debated ordering it again, it was that good. We also had the chicken quesadilla, it was an open faced, type Mexican pizza, but it was so delicious and so fresh. For dinner we had the new chicken dish, which was the best \"Pollo Asada\" type chicken I have had in a long time. My fiance' had the Doble tacos and it reminded us of what taco Bell should strive to be, seriously so fresh and delicious we wanted more and more.. atop all the great food, the watermelon and mango margaritas we're her favorite in town and I love the Paloma. If you haven't been here yet I suggest coming in Wednesdays, it's All day happy hour."}
{"text":"We arrived at around 430 for happy hour. Restaurant was about a 1/3 full but well expected for a Monday. We were greeted by Brandon right away and he was phenomenal. I order the watermelon Margarita which was pleasantly not sweet. The hints of Pepper and and salted rim was a perfect combination. For HH we ordered the Nachos and the street corn. Both of which were fantastic. How can you go wrong with a plate full of cheese, meat, guacamole, etc... Be warned the portion sizes will not leave you wanting!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is awesome: love the dj ;-) our service was great. The food could definitely use some work, especially for the price. I ordered the \"street corn\"... it came in a bowl. The toppings were amazing, but lasted for the first two bites and then literally tasted like just a bowl of sweet corn. Also ordered the Pozole. It tasted like tomato paste with hominy. The pork IN IT was delicious and tender but barely any in there. But the \"broth\" was way too Thick to be soup - and even stew. Also... it was luke warm. Probably won't ever come here again unfortunately... especially with ok food and high prices :-/"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was good also but was on the salty side. They need to back off on the salt for sure. The guacamole was very good and fun because you can build your own from pomegranate to actual grasshoppers. Yes I said grasshoppers!  Good vibe, restaurant was very nicely hipp decor. However not sure what they are trying to do with the music!!!! It felt like I was at a rave!!  Do they even have those anymore!!!  Anyway all in all it was a great experience!!  We'll be back for taco Tuesday for $1 off tacos and $5 margs!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing.. to the  fullest . Very good food, drinks and music. Stop in and meet Vinny, Cole, Mike, and Jesse the manager. The best customer service ever!!!  Fun, fun, fun!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service is not great. The bartender seemed way more interested in hitting on girls at the bar than serving the rest of the customers. My fianc√© and I waited 10 minutes for menus and almost 20 minutes before being asked what we wanted. The bartender was also ignoring other customers trying to get his attention. There were probably 10 people at the bar and two bartenders. Also, they don't serve food past 10 but are open until 2!?   When we asked at midnight if they still were serving food the bartender laughed at us and said no. Not even chips and salsa? Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Way to loud, carne asada is shaved meat, tortillas cold, server a young girl who really didn't know the food or drink menu. Corn good but overall food to hyped up. Basically another hipster taco place no real flavor or device. Happy hour only next time . Somewhere else for food"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delish food & drinks. Must try the huarache! They also have a DJ, wow!! Loved the vibe!! Think I found me new fav Mexican spot"}
{"text":"Less than ideal experience. Came here for Father's Day yesterday. Made reservations and requested a table inside-it was 108 degrees. They insisted on seating us outside because they didn't have enough tables inside (why allow me to request an indoor/outdoor table on the reservation at all?). They only have 3 mister systems outside that barely do anything-get more misters or don't offer outdoor seating. Also, when I went inside to use the restroom there were half a dozen empty booths so that was frustrating. 
Service was awful-took 20 min just to get a draft beer. Took us 45 to even order food. Everything was just so delayed, I don't understand why. The whole lunch took 2.5 hours for 4 people. The table next to us got so fed up with their food wait time they angrily got up and left. It was pretty awkward but I understood where they were coming from. It then took the staff over 45 minutes to even clear their table off, so odd!
The food was nothing special: I got the nachos while my other family members got tacos. Not worth the price, small portions. Also, the green  salsa they doused on all of our entrees was incredibly spicy. We all had to share each other's drinks to cool our mouths down because, again, our drinks (including water) took over 15 min minimum to refill."}
{"text":"Patio dining - went for taco Tuesday.  They have several options to mix & match for $8 and lots of guac options for the bland palette to the adventurous.  We went with a spicy guac option with chorizo - not my fave. Swordfish taco was overcooked, the short rib taco was yummy and the chicken taco was good.  My husband ordered the fried fish taco and loved it.  The corn taco shells itself were mealy, almost like they had flour in them.  Overall three stars, it's a place to hang on the patio in the afternoon/evening with chips, salsa and cerveza."}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere here, great decor, DJ was playing. Great place to go on a Friday night! We  started our night with the street corn, chips and salsa, ceviche. I wasn't expecting my corn to be in a cup, but it was still really tasty. Ceviche was good but I would have preferred my shrimp to be cut up and not whole pieces. Now the tacos were delicious, simple but good. We ordered the rajas relleno, which was my favorite, the machaca tacos and the octopus tostada. They seem to be doing well for just opening not too long ago, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is your basic taco joint. Basic service and basic food. Austin and 2 other bartenders manned the 1/3 full bar yet we still had to call out and wave them all down for every BASIC need (water .. never offered and had to ask for it twice when first request was forgotten), drinks -- those pesky empty adult drinks . Sitting there like a big bad clue of emptiness and only ice cubes left, yet no one could be bothered ! And last but not least, the check. If I have to ask for everything during my visit what really is the point?"}
{"text":"This place was excellent, for it being the first time coming, I was happy! Now, this place is meant for people who love spice, if you do not, please don't come here. The waitress was fast, efficient, and ready to go. If you're into a lively atmosphere, this place fits well too!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty darn tasty! Atmosphere is fantastic. Bartenders need to be a tad more attentive. The DJ Hartbreaks really brings it! Would come here to just to slam margaritas and listen to him
any time every time."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today after a good day of giving back during the Hydr8 The Homeless Water Drive. Good environment, good music, good drinks and Happy Hour menu. We liked the Chips and Salsa and lived that we could customize our guacamole. I had the Chicken tacos, bland but better with salsa. Carne Asada good flavor and tender great with salsa. Tried the Octopus tacos for the first time, pretty good with salsa. I will be going back but I had to give them a 3 because they don't give you Rice & Beans with your tacos. I'll be back to try a burrito next time. #FoodJones"}
{"text":"Went opening night. Keyword being opening night on cinco no less  As expected with a brand new place there are some hiccups that I'm sure will get worked out. 

Yes took a while to get a drink. But it was a great drink and the food was amazing. The octopus tacos were unreal. I Had never octopus tacos before and I'm obsessed now.  Carne asada tacos were also unbelievable meat cooked perfect and was juicy and flavorful. I find most place overlook the meat drying it out wasn't the case here. My friend had guac and she said it was best she's ever had. I hate that green stuff so I didn't try. 

The decor is amazing. So warm and inviting with a great energy. I'll def be back time and time again and should only get better as they work out the kinks. 

In a highly competitive market this place will stand out and shine and I think will have a good bar scene. Look forward to being a regular."}
{"text":"Like the look and possibilities for this place, but if part of the premise is having street tacos for late night (after 10:00) dining, you should be able to deliver. I was told at 10:15, they didn't understand the POS and so I'd have to wait 20 minutes to order. Don't make your problem my problem if you want to be successful.

It just got worse as the night progressed. We told our waiter and someone at the hostess desk on our way out about the problems with the outdoor taco bar. Rather than offering to help, they just focused on how busy they were. Fortunately, Dick's Hideaway a short drive away was much more accommodating and they even had a late night happy hour!  They were busy, but found time to deliver great food and customer service."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience...  Heard good things about their guac.  The kitchen messed up both of our custom guac orders, which isn't the end of the world however the waitstaffs attempt to make it right was to take one of them back to the kitchen and have them add the missing ingredient after we had already started eating it...  Just didn't feel like we got \"taken care of\"...  Maybe it was an off night for them"}
{"text":"Talk about expensive. Our total bill was so pricey and the amount of food received was snack size. Overall between the service, food, and extremely high bill, I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed dining here! The ambiance was really nice! Both food and Margaritas were delicious! I would definitely come back to this place. The neighborhood needed something like this."}
{"text":"I never put bad reviews but I feel I should make it aware how HORRIBLE their service was . I'm usually understanding when places are busy, but it was a Friday evening with about 7 tables , almost everyone was at the bar ... it took one hour to get chips and guac, it took another hour to get WATER, and another hour to get the check. 

Besides the service:

The food was great, and the decor is cute . 

I recommend their steak tacos, and their posole!"}
{"text":"Nothing bad. Just nothing stand out.

Arrived around 7:30 p. on a Sunday. The place was pretty empty. Nice hostess made her way to the front from some far off place reasonably quickly. We were shown to a booth that was spectacularly uncomfortable - like a church pew with some throw pillows (how do they keep those pillows clean?). We could see the kitchen including the pass. I wasn't sure if all the people back there actually belonged back there as one was wearing a sweatshirt. Server was prompt, polite and made good menu recommendations.

Requested \"unflavored\" black iced tea was decent but it is not unflavored. Bummer. Refill pitchers were brought to the table, thank you. No refills on water that I recall.

They charge $8 for a good size portion of freshly made guacamole. An extra $1.50 for the salsa. The \"hot\" salsa was oddly flavored and not hot. Pico is pico. The mild salsa had good flavor. I think the menu price for chips and salsa is $5. Why do places think they can charge for chips and salsa? If I come back, I'll order the gauc (with none of their suggested additives ... pop rocks?) and not the salsa and see what I get charged. The guacamole is not priced on the menu.

Recommended Flautas with chicken were nicely plated and flavorful yet buried under iceberg lettuce and pico. The chili verde was a large portion of soaked, shredded pork belly in a chili sauce with an occasional radish for color and some cheese. Served with hand made flour tortillas. It did not look appetizing at all. Not very inspired but tasted OK. 

No suggestion of dessert so I have no idea what they may offer.

Worth a second try. But, I wouldn't go far out of my way for this one as other choices are nearby."}
{"text":"I Love Love Casa A?ejo! I just had my baby shower there and they're super nice and the food was amazing"}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago. The service was great and the food was yummy! The best thing was you can make your own guacamole and add different things. They have a long drink menu and the food is pretty basic. It's very pricey for what it is and the music is quite loud. Would definitely go again, though!"}
{"text":"Another taco place, exactly what Phoenix needs...as if there isn't enough.

I went for happy hour based on a friends suggestion. $5 margaritas sound good to me. Too bad they tasted like pure margarita mix. Did they forget the tequila? Our server was nice and attentive but helicoptered over us to the point where I almost invited him to sit with us. We ordered some tacos and they came out like the Taco Bell double decker. Which don't get me wrong, I love some Taco Bell. And sadly Taco Bell has a better double decker. Interior is really nice, the aprons for the servers are really cool. Overall, I could do without going back. It will likely be a sushi place in a year."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and energy, but only because it's new. This place does not stand out as far as the food. There's too much competition for them not to stand out for the food. We ordered street tacos and Pozole. The street tacos were fish (fried was the only option) and you could taste the grease that took over the taco, chicken (which was so bland, it wasn't seasoned and only tasted the charred portion) and the Pozole was just ok, but much better than the tacos. The chicken in the taco was basically riding on the flavor of the crema that didn't do it justice. Better tacos just a couple blocks away at Otro Cafe. The drinks were good, but you can get a decent cocktail at other places too. We did enjoy the atmosphere as mentioned and the staff were attentive."}
{"text":"Food is good... service spotty....  music too loud....  and upsell sneaky.

first the food is tasty..  the guac fun to make your own style... the Taco Tuesday deals great !
but..  while waiting for the others to arrive server asked if he could bring chips and salsa.. this is a Mexican restaurant. sure.  who doesn't enjoy some chips and salsa... when we ordered drinks... all house special margaritas he said were $5 tuesday..   great, i chose one... and one friend asked if she could have vodka in hers instead of tequila...  sure he says.. is Tito's ok.. ok she said..  not quite realizing she had not made just a substitution but he had upsold her a good 220%  her $5 drink went to $11 without realizing..  she did not ask for Tito;s, he did not ask if she wanted to select a higher vodka, merely if Tito;s was ok...  so we were surprised to see the charge more than double..  and a charge for the salsa a chips... we did ORDER Guac and Chips.  would not have ORDERED 2 chips...  i did not realize i ORDERED chips when he asked if he could bring chips and salsa.. perhaps if he asked if i wanted to ORDER chips and salsa while i waited for them....  but just felt they were sneaky in how they word things...  when this was mentioned to the manager... i guess this is how they train them since the manager did say.. you said ok, she said ok..  i guess they try to upsell you without you realizing it... most Mexican restaurants do offer you a bowl of chips and salsa... everywhere here in the valley... who knew i was ORDERING it. i would not have ordered 2 bowls of chips when i then ordered the Guac and chips.  so left a sour taste....  and the ice tea came to the table and the cocktails took a good 15 minutes more to arrive.  we did flag down the hostess to ask if the server went on break since we were thirsty..  water delayed as well. refill on the ice tea also promised and took a while to arrive...  and then the tacos.  three of us and the other two got each others plates... and did not realize it until the last taco.. that they had been given each others plates..  too late...  one might think the restaurant had just opened this week. but sadly this is the state of affairs these days. blast the music and don't let them realize you upsold them."}
{"text":"The food is terrific.  I have been for lunch and brunch.  Super tasty.  The staff is... young.  Lots of 'gather at the bar to talk shop/complain about schedules and flirt with each other' time with the staff.  The bar staff needs training in customer relations and how to work a bar.  They seem like newbies and try awkwardly to engage customers, BUT the food is TERRIFIC.  They just need to grow into themselves.  I hope they survive the 7th street boom in restaurants.  We will go back."}
{"text":"My friends and I went out to celebrate tonight and wanted to eat dinner here. We walked in and the hostess took a name and phone number and said it would be a few minutes 30 minutes later still have not heard anything and one of my friends asked the hostess if we could be seated because there was a bunch of open tables and people that came in after us we're already sitting with drinks. Finally we were seated out on the patio it was very pleasant out doors however service was still terrible. Our waiter brought us water asked us if we wanted food from the grill we did and we never saw him again and my friend asked the grill staff how we order tacos after sitting there for 15 more minutes. Finally we got to order tacos in a line. The tacos tasted delicious but were way overpriced for the quantity you got, and the street corn was good but a little chard and had crunched up pieces of what tasted to me like Doritos. I didn't like the burn on the corn or Doritos other than that it was good. Napkins we had to ask for and we got no silverware. It was decent food just crappy customer service and overpriced"}
{"text":"If you post online that you are open until midnight, don't close at 10pm.  This area has seen restaurants fail regularly.  This is a bad way to start."}
{"text":"I've been here 2 times, I've experienced excellent service, the corn was delicious, I also had the raja tacos; they didn't disappoint, I tried the salsas-- the habanero salsa was my favorite.  The second time I was there I had the pollo, it was fantastic, mmm I want to have it again, but the #1 reason I'll keep going back is because of their beautiful Patio, Bar and MANGO margarita with CasaAmigos Reposado OMG!!!"}
{"text":"First time I went it was delicious. Carnitas tacos were 10/10. Put crab in the guac and there was a lot of crab chunks. 

Second time I went it was horrible. Carnitas tacos were drenched in oil which made my tortilla soggy...I only ate one because I felt my arteries clogging. Ordered the same guac with crab. There was no crab. Ask the waitress to take it back to add more crab and she said it was extra. 

Probably not going back due to my second experience. I can see this place is going downhill after the first time I've been."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since it opened. While the service was excellent the food not so much. The ceviche is great but I ordered the chicken tacos and the chicken was dry and not flavorful. I had hopes"}
{"text":"Great new spot on 7th street.  I have been able to dine here twice since it has opened and have loved it both times.  Ambiance....  Love the thier take on a modern Mexican decor.  Feels like you are in a hip restaurant in Tulum.  The music is upbeat and is a great spot for dinner with a group of friends.  Drinks... Hand crafted cocktails that can't be beat.  The margaritas are some of the best in town and love the Michelada.  Food... The street tacos are delicious (my favorites are the carne asada & fish), Posole is top notch, Casa Salad is a favorite, and they have a build your own guacamole menu!  They also make all of thier chips in house and have both traditional and a home made \"doritios\" style.  Service...  Everyone is helpful, friendly,  and focused on your experience.  This is definitely my new go to spot for the weekends!!"}
{"text":"The worse service I have ever had. The bar drinks were horrific and took forever to come out. Our food was out before our drinks and the drinks were so gross. They were watered down and had so much sour mix."}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends on Friday for a late lunch, and we had a blast.  Let's start with the decor. The check in station is shaped like an avocado. It was super cute. The rest of the restaurant was beautifully designed with a full glass view into the kitchen, a huge bar with giant TVs, a stunning back wall, and a gorgeous wrap-around patio dinning area with a taco stand for late night festivities was the icing on the cake as far as decor goes. We started off with a guacamole. This whimsical, build our own guac using a bingo dauber to select our toppings like Pop Rocks, smoked salmon, crab, chapulines (crickets), bacon, roasted corn, and pomegranate just to name a few, was super fun.  We had to add Pop Rocks and chapulines to our guac because c'mon, who wouldn't!? We selected to have medium heat to our guac. The finished guac was a masterpiece. The chapulines had a salty, lime with chipotle flavors to them. The Pop Rocks added a fun element to our guac. Overall, it's a must order dish here. Next, we had the Mexican Pizza. The fresh veggies, the cheese, and the chorizo came together harmoniously in our mouths. This is a simple dish, but very refreshing. My all time favorite dish here so far has to be the pozole. I know what you all are thinking... pozole?? Yup, pozole!! The pork was cooked to perfection. The pieces were nice and tender. The hominy added a softer texture to the dish. The vibrant color from the red chili, the avocado, radish, cheese, and cilantro really brought this comfort dish home for me. My young friend, Mia, didn't want to try it, but wouldn't let go of the bowl once she did. She told the rest of us that she wasn't going to share :). The chorizo tacos definitely has the heat factor. One bite, and the heat from the habanero hits you instantly. Have your glass of Margarita in hand :).  Speaking of Margaritas, we ordered the  Berry Hibiscus, Mango, and house margaritas and they were the perfect summer drinks for us. For dessert, we had the house made grapefruit and key lime pie paletas, and churros. These two desserts really took us back to our happy childhood. We had so much fun trying out all the dishes. The staff here is terrific. Jesse, one of the managers, took the time to explain to us the meaning behind Casa Anejo, and menu. His knowledge of tequila will blow your mind, while his contagious smile, and cheerful personality will set your mood up for a happy experience. A special thank you goes out to Chef Drew for visiting us at our table to us  give his views on the dishes we ordered. To our assistant server, Connor, you were the best. We appreciate your wonderful service. A stunning place, delicious food with great service, I can't imagine spending Friday with my friends anywhere else. Until next time, stay amazing peeps!!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night after happy hour. The place is cute. The ceviche and guac are AMAZING! The bar tenders didn't make a drink we didn't like. I can't say I'd come here for dinner but I would come back and order a table full of shareables!"}
{"text":"Great guac!! You can add pop rocks!! Great steak tacos. LOVE the atmosphere. It's a must visit!!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! A little in the spicy side but this is one place we will return. 
The $5 Sunday happy hour margaritas are delicious. Love that they offer brunch food and these scrumptious tacos (baja & dobl√© tacos FTW) the tea of my party cleared their plates. 
Abigail R was great casual and friendly server. 
With so many restaurants in this town the bar is set high for now this place is on out come back to list!!
Oh!!! And they gave a guac bingo sheet seriously a fun yet sophisticated place"}
{"text":"Pitiful portions.  Tiniest street tacos in the valley. Way overpriced. Great atmosphere but that won't fill you up. Good music too."}
