{"text":"I have no idea why there's a negative on this restaurant. This is jade east. A pinnacle in the community. Yes when you call in they perhaps have a language barrier but they still put effort to understand. I have lived in the vicinity and have never had a problem. I receive my food quickly. Always cooked well. I have never had a problem with them in the past 15 years. Yes 15 years....hey I'm not THAT old. It's a hidden gem in the sterotyped area that is Jane & Finch. 
Just execute patience, you'll get your food and a full belly to boot."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!!! 
I experienced absolutely horrible customer service. There is no access to an online menu...good luck trying to order without being yelled at or hung up on! 

I called the restaurant today to inquire if they had Singapore rice noodles. They did so I asked if they had a minimum delivery charge. She said $25. I then moved on to asking what kind of beef and chicken dishes they had with garlic and a soy sauce base. The lady kept giving me vegetable options. She then told me someone could help me decide what I want. 

A man comes on the phone so I explain to him it's a little hard to order as there was no online menu. I told him I was looking for a beef or chicken dish. He starts yelling saying , \"you come here in person I cannot explain to you what's on the menu, you will not like what I tell you\". I said I'm obviously calling for take out, tell me what's popular. He continued to yell saying I don't have time for this and hung up the phone!

I was absolutely shocked at this third world behavior and decided to call the woman back. She answered the phone so I told her that the man who was supposed to help me was anything but. She said he wass the owner!! She continued to yell and hung up the phone on me! 

I have never experienced such ignorant behavior from a restaurant who is so unwilling to help customers who are trying to order. 

They need to learn some customer service!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good Chinese-Canadian (chicken balls) and Chinese food (Cantonese chow mein) ... Chicken balls are perfectly golden crisp with a generous piece of white meat chicken which comes with a huge vat of sweet and sour sauce (red sauce to some). Service is quick and friendly. Skip the chow mein (bean sprouts) and go for the Cantonese chow mein.... and the chicken balls too, lol. The fried rice is also good :) 
 

kthxbye"}
{"text":"Just moved to the north York area and I heard about this place through word of mouth. We sometimes like to order in Chinese food and decided to try Jade East out. Based on other reviews it seems like they improved their online menu as we had no problems finding and ordering what we needed. Nice customer service on the food and good time for food delivery. 

We ordered :
Cantonese chow mein, lemon chicken, bbq spare ribs, chicken fried rice.

Food was very good, nice comfort fast food Chinese. No complaints other than the rice was a bit dry. 
Repeat customer here!"}
{"text":"Good cheap food! 
I usually opt in for the specials but every time I order from here they make the food fresh and the portions are amazing"}
