{"text":"This restaurant was very classy. Me and my wife brought a bottle of wine a appetizer and 2 dinners and the bill was only 62 bucks. The food was amazing so much flavor!! The staff was very polite and fast."}
{"text":"I've been several times and the service & food was okay, but today the food & service was not very good!!!The fries were cold and the fish was cooked to hard in my opinion. I'm sure it'll be a while if I ever decide go back!!"}
{"text":"Always delicious food and great atmosphere. 
Kudos, kudos to the chefs. I've been here 5 times (would be more, but calorie intake is a factor) and have ordered 5 different entrees. All have surpassed my expectations. The side dishes...greens, yams, mac and cheese were all on point. I've found these types of sides to be mediocre at best at similar type restaurants. 
You can actually taste the seasonings on the fish and chicken dishes. For the aforementioned reason, I haven't had much experience with the desserts, but have sampled my sister's slice of sweet potato pie. Yuuuuum!!!! I will definitely make an exception to that on my next visit.
The live music is exactly that...LIVE and energetic, soothing, head bopping, etc. The musicians are always phenomenal. 
All in all, I'm always excited to dine here and will be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"I came here last week with a group of colleagues.  I was hesitant about dining here, because of the bad Yelp reviews.  Yelp rarely leads me astray, so I told my group that I would not be joining them for dinner.  One of my colleagues advised me that she is a regular at Frederick's, and she asked me to ignore the reviews and try the restaurant. I value her opinion, so I took her advice and joined the group for dinner.

We arrived close the 6pm on Tuesday, and the restaurant wasn't too crowded.  It was very clean, and the music was soothing.  We had a party of about 12 people.  Our waitress was attentive and diligent.  She walked us through the menu and gave us suggestions.  

We started with bread and drinks, and the majority of us had salads. The bread was fresh and the salad tasted great.  I drank water, but it was good too haha. 

My colleague suggested I try a fish dish.   She said all of the fish was excellent.  I didn't have the taste for fish, so I ordered the fried chicken along with greens and candied yams.  

The chicken was hot and juicy!  It had plenty of flavor and I turned it up a few notches by adding hot sauce and ketchup.  The greens were very good.  They were flavorful, and not too heavy with grease.  They were cleaned well.  But for me, those yams stole the show. They were the real deal. Christmas and Thanksgiving time real deal.  They were fresh and not too sweet. Just the right amount of sugar, brown sugar, and butter. I used my bread to clean the bowl if that lets you know how good the yams were.

The restaurant was packed by the time we finished eating, so I suggest you get there early...

My advice is give Frederick's a try and judge  it for yourself. If I'm ever back in Cleveland, I will certainly be back in Frederick's again!"}
{"text":"This place could easily be 5 stars if they would get their service issues figured out.  The servers are nice it is just that they are slow.  We used to go here for lunch but it just takes too damn long to get in, eat, and get out.

The food is excellent.  I recommend the catfish or the pork chops.  I really love this place and would go here more but like I said it just takes too long.  I guess you have to be patient for anything good, but they can do better I am sure.

Fredericks - get your servers and service figured out and you'll get 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"I visit this place last week for the first time, just had couple of beers and wings. I set on the bar, and I have to say that if you do go there DO NOT sit at the bar! It is very uncomfortable. The bar wasn't build right. It is too high and very deep, made me feel like a child sitting on a booster chair....lol.
I was there on Sunday and there was live music that I have to say was good but if you try to talk it is impossible so make sure you do not want to hear or talk to anyone. The bartender was very nice but I felt like she didn't know much. My first beer was not a full glass. It was 1/3 of foam...
When looking at the menu I've noticed that they charge extra for celery....that send a vibe of being cheap! I got the wing on a large serving plate and me and my friend shared but they didn't give us small plates so we had to spread napkins on the bad and made a mess. It was too much! No wet napkins to clean with. 
I had to go to the bathroom and there was pee all over the floor.
You think I'll go again?
I gave it the 2 stars only bc the food taste good and the bartender was very nice even though she didn't know much."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a restaurant that is loud and noisy that offers mediocre food and slow service, then Frederick's is just the place for you.  This was my first time at this restaurant having located it on-line since it was in close proximity to another location where we had previously had a department meeting with our group.

I was with a party of four that arrived about 5:45.  We were seated immediately since there were only 5 other tables of diners.  Our server arrived quickly and introduced herself and then just as quickly another server arrived and stated he would be taking over since it was the change of shift.  We ordered drinks (a draft beer, 2 long island ice teas and a vodka and tonic).   It took about 10 minutes to receive our drinks.   I requested a lime for my vodka & tonic.   The server left and returned a few minutes later with another server whom he introduced as a trainee and she would be taking our orders.  (He did not bring back the lime.)  

Three of us ordered seafood and one ordered pork chops.   I had the catfish, pan fried with fries and cole slaw.  When my food arrived, two of the meals were given to the wrong person but since the young lady was a trainee we overlooked this.  But the first thing I noticed was the size of the two filets.  They were huge.  That, however, was the end of my excitement over the meal.  The catfish had a very thick breading which was heavily seasoned.   But the catfish itself lacked any seasoning including salt.  It was actually difficult to cut through the breading to get at the catfish itself.  I did not like the seasoning in the breading but after removing the breading the catfish lacked flavor.  It did not appear to be fresh.  I only ate one of the filets.  The fries were also heavily seasoned.   Not a big fan.  I wish they had stated this on the menu for both the catfish and fries.  There was no mention of the type of seasoning used like other restaurants do.  I also had to ask for a lime for my drink again as well as some more ice since all of mine had melted.  

The small crowd was very loud, especially one table of 6 people that was in close proximity to our table.  It is obviously a neighborhood restaurant that caters to the locals.  I was very disappointed and would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service and actual establishment, not so much. The bathroom was not clean at all and didn't look as if it had been cleaned in a while. The service was slow and they piled everyone in so tight that there was hardly any walking room in between tables. The servers kept bumping into us and anyone else that had to try and walk through. I love the live band but they were too loud at times and we had a hard time hearing each other and found ourselves yelling just to talk over the band. I think I will stick to take out from here on out."}
{"text":"Arrival time 7:30pm. Orders placed immediately. Ordered appetizers and food at the same time. Salads and appetizers came out together at 8:30pm. Meals came out at 8:50pm. 9 guests at the table. 3 meals prepared the correct way. 8:56pm still waiting on pork chops for one person in our party. My perch was small and dry. The yams were good. SERVICE TOTALLY SUCKS!!! The waiter was nice but not very attentive. The restaurant was warm and uncomfortable. Brought family from TX here. They were thoroughly disappointed.  Not pleased with my experience at all. I'd like to add that as I finish this review at 9:10, some of the party is awaiting to-go boxes, because we were filled up with bread and water while the other person in our party still has not received food. SAD"}
{"text":"This is a down home casual restaurant with good food. Portions are on the small side and it's expensive for what you get. The bar tenders are no nonsense, but the place has a overall comfortable welcoming vibe. The drinks are great, and they have live music! My only real gripe is the bar is way too high for the chairs! I guess they ordered the wrong chairs, but heck, the place has been open long enough for them to replace them. I was very uncomfortable sitting there, it reminded me of being at the bank counter when I was little....barely able to see over the bar. I got the catfish sandwich and was still hungry after my meal. This could be the \"new\" Lancers!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food at this establishment.  There was nothing but professionalism and great customer service.  The garlic parmesean wings were phenomenal and I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for this past weekend 9/19/2015, was seated fairly quickly. The \"server\" came and took our drink order. We immediately ordered one appetizer. The appetizer took an hour and 15 mins to come out. Meanwhile our \"server\" NEVER came back to check on us, Never came back to refill our drinks, or say ANYTHING about our wait. It felt as though he was avoiding us, he served all the tables he had around us and wouldn't even look our way even ONCE. When the appetizer finally came out (which someone else brought out) it looked as though it had been cooked in a rush, when I told the girl that we had been waiting for over an hour for this appetizer and our waiter had not even come back to check on us, refill our drinks or anything she says \"Well what do you want me to do? Yall just wanna leave?\" Lol, really? Um, yeah and we will NEVER be back. Situations like this right here make you not even want to patronize certain businesses. Rather go where you know you'll get \"good\" service. Sad........."}
{"text":"We were there for a big party, so the wait staff was overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Whenever the Owner takes time to serve you well and provide complimentary drinks to make up for a short pour, you're in food service heaven! After a brief experience in Chagrin Falls the same evening, I decided to bring my friend here for \"real food and customer service\" which was lacking in CF. Green beens were just like my gma's, fried chicken was on point, calamari with old bay was decent but pretty tasty, and the Owner was so attentive and friendly as well as professional--which is underrated in the service industry. I especially love the atmosphere and will continue to make this place my welcoming intro to anyone visiting my hometown. Thanks for bringing good quality service, entertainment and food to Warrensville :)"}
{"text":"Let me start off by stating that I don't give out many 5 star reviews.  This was my second visit to this restaurant.  The first visit more than 1 year ago, was not favorable.  This visit however, was OUTSTANDING.   One plus, was the ability to make a reservation, on-line.  In addition, we arrived a few minutes ahead of our reservation, and seated within a few minutes.  The restaurant was clean, the hostess was pleasant and our server was very accommodating.  Now on to the star of the show....the FOOD!   I ordered the Shrimp and Fish Combo for $14.75.  The meal included a round loaf of Asiago Cheese bread for sharing, a tossed salad (fresh ingredients, tasty dressing) and 2 side dishes.  The courses were timed perfectly, our entrees arrived just as we were finishing our salads.  My meal included, 2 nice sized pieces of well seasoned perch and 4 jumbo hand-breaded shrimp.   My sides included a generous portion of hand-cut fries and homemade coleslaw.  The plate was garnished and included the proper condiments (cocktail & tartar sauce).  My husband ordered the blackened catfish which include 2 very large fillets.  I am SO glad that I gave this restaurant a 2nd chance.  We left full and happy.   I was so pleasantly surprised by this second visit, that I stopped the manager (who was visible throughout the entire visit, setting up tables, checking on customers etc.), to convey how pleased we were.   I highly recommend this restaurant, I can't wait to re-visit....SOON!!"}
{"text":"I ordered fried chicken, collard greens, Mac and cheese, and yams and my husband ordered the grill chicken dinner. My fried chicken was not seasoned AT ALL!!! It tasted like I was eating fried nothing. The Mac and cheese and yams were ok, and the collard greens were good but I couldn't fully enjoy them because of how disappointed I was with the rest of my meal. My husband's grilled chicken made me sick just looking at it! It was drowned under a glob of cheese. I love cheese and so does my husband and he barely wanted to eat it. Once he removed the cheese he said it tasted alright but nothing to go crazy over. My husband also ordered a Long Island iced tea and it was so bad he had to send it back. I suggest keeping it basic with the drinks because they haven't seemed to master mixed drinks yet. Also if you aren't at least 6'4 I don't suggest sitting at the bar if you don't have a high chair. Someone messed up bad and made the bar too tall for the chairs they have smh. I won't return!!!

I can't complain about the service though. Our server was very nice and did a great job attending to us."}
{"text":"Best part of this night was the band. Service was absolutely horrible. Food wasn't that great either. But the live music was worth it."}
{"text":"Located just off the interstate in a nice and cozy place. They take reservations on Friday, it is equipped for a band, my server Sean was great.  The music was old school with a mix of new school.   My con was the food portion was small and a little bit pricey for my taste.  However, I would go back for the music the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Ugh this place... I feel like they need to read their reviews and improve their business. We came here for Mother's Day, which was my boyfriend's sisters suggestion. In her defense, she has been here before and had good food and good service so it seemed like a good option.

The night started with a reservation for 6 at 6pm. When we got there they were busy and our table was not ready... 35 min later we finally had a place to sit. While we were waiting they had a band playing, very loudly, to the point that we were not able to have a conversation with each other while we waited for our table. The hostess ran around trying to get people sat while acting annoyed the entire time. By the time we sat the band had gone on break and we were able to enjoy each other and talk while we again waited to put in drink and app orders... Then for the drinks... Then for the rest of the apps... Then to put our order in. I felt like all we did was wait at this place. By the time we got our drinks the band started back up again and we could no longer talk to each other. I am fine with a loud band, but not in a small restaurant on Mother's Day! 

The food... Well the menu was a little limited for my taste and quite pricy. I am not a seafood eater and I felt like my options were VERY limited. I ordered a pasta dish with chicken and veggies. The pasta was so over cooked it was mushy and the chicken was clearly just microwave and serve precooked chicken that had no flavor. For $17! No thanks. I ate less than half and didn't feel good after. Everyone else in our party ate their food and said it was just okay. For the price the food was not worth it at all. 

The service... Wow. No thanks! I felt bad in a way because there was no way they could hear while the band was playing. There were a few items messed up in our orders just simply because our server could not hear us. This still does not make up for our lack of service. We were left to fend for ourselves on many occasions, asking other servers for napkins, silverware, and even handing over my water glass because my boyfriend was out for a solid 30 min. His mother's drink sat at the bar for 20 min before it made it to the table and very little attention was paid to getting any other drinks. Our server was lucky they added the 18% gratuity to the bill because she did not earn that. 

Overall this place was mismanaged and quiet frankly I am surprised it was as busy as it was for how overpriced it was. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Went once. Slow. Poorly trained servers. 

Visit number two. I gave them another chance......

Ridiculously slow. A meal should not take 40minutes!!!!!!!!!!!

Food is good. Prices high. Service poor. 

Never going back."}
{"text":"Terrible service went to door and wasn't able to get service. When I called they answered and just said sorry we don't know why it said 2:30 am ..
That's just crazy to me."}
{"text":"DONT COME HERE! this place used to be pretty good when it opened but it is just terrible now. The service is deplorable. I went in on a Sunday and there were 3 families there and the rest of the restaurant is open. Why are you seating me at a dirty table and had me wait 10 minutes with a reservation? Mind you; there was barely anyone there. 

The service was a mess. This server I had clearly didn't care about customer service and was dry and just TERRIBLE.

The menu reads that their calamari is prepared FRESH. That's a bold faced lie. It tastes like it was pulled from a frozen bag and fried. So not worth the money. 

I'm so annoyed that I even patronized this place. And let's not even talk about the BLARING music that they play. You can't even hear yourself talk or the people you're with.

Don't waste your time. I barely even leave reviews but I had to advise people about this place."}
{"text":"I only gave this place a three star because the service was great, live music & a comedian but the food sucked. I had the Cajan chicken & shrimp. The noodles were too soft. My 18 day old daughter could have ate this meal - mushy baby food. Go for drinks only!!"}
{"text":"came here for my cousins birthday. Joseph was our waiter and he was so kind and patient w our party of 7! 
The food was decent. I got the pork chops. They were seasoned pretty well but tasted as if fried in old grease. Mac n Cheese was drier than I like but was ok and the yams were just ok. Kinda like they were canned but they added some extra spices.
Most had the perch and it looked amazing and all said was great!"}
{"text":"All is nice the food the wine the selection, but the problem is the location.  The location is safe but there is nothing around to support the restaurant."}
{"text":"The last time I visited this place was 8 months ago for Mother's day and the service was just as bad as on Mother's Day.  I was with a party of eight and the wait for food and drinks was unreal!  At least we kept each other company during the wait.  I ordered the potato skins and shrimp scampi.  The potato skins were burnt and the scampi was over cooked and gritty.  This is also one of a few places that still adds gratuity to the bill automatically instead of suggesting a gratuity.  I would never pay for the service I received here.  There was live music, but the sound was not adjusted for the small space.  We often found ourselves unable to hear each or yelling in an attempt to talk over the music.  It's safe to say I will not willingly return to this place and if suggested by someone else I will point them to the numerous reviews that state you should not go here!"}
{"text":"Food not that great.  Very loud when music is playing.  Gets very crowded on the weekends"}
{"text":"A must go. Highly recommend. 

Today we buried our Mother. The repast was held at Frederick's. the service, attention the servers provided was outstanding. I had not been to the restaurant before, but will certainly go back. Highly recommend. The owner was excellent to work with. Everything was wonderful, which made this difficult time a little easier.  The food was excellent  - well seasoned. Will definitely return to check out the dinner service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Location isn't great, but interior is clean and somewhat minimalist. A group of us went mid-week, and it was not crowded at all.  Some of the food was quite good, while other dishes were not as good. I really enjoyed the fried grouper and shrimp, which were flavorful, tender inside and crisp outside, and not overly greasy. The fried grouper got better reviews than the grilled. The side of mixed vegetables (squash, onions, and peppers) was surprisingly flavorful, while others in the group thought the coleslaw was excellent. Two people ordered the fried pork chop entree and thought the preparation was good, although the seasoning was \"nothing special.\" The pan fried potatoes side was overly greasy. On the other hand, the apple Betty dessert was thought to be very good (with high praise for the crust), and the pecan sweet potato pie was excellent.

The major negative here was service,  which was prompt but unprofessional. I received my entree before the salad. Dishes were not cleared, and the server dropped dirty dishes on one of our party twice. We were given checks without being offered the option of ordering dessert. While we had a large party of 7, the rest of the restaurant was not overly busy, so the poor service stood out.

Worth a try if you're a fan of Southern food, but be prepared for poor service."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because it's the first Sunday , or maybe it's because I'm here with a large party but the service is not the best. Salads and the bread came out to the table about 45 minutes to a hour after we ordered. I ordered the raspberry vinegerette and it was really thick and sweet. The bread was okay. I ordered a drink (2.50) it never came.  They're playing Christmas music in March!! The food is usually brought out together but only one half of the table received food. It's been an hour and 30minutes now. Okay finally got my food. I order blackened salmon I got seasoned salmon instead of what I ordered. I also ordered Mac and cheese which wasn't bad and green beans which taste burnt. They started passing out to go boxes before we actually got a chance got a chance to really get into the food. So I'm done now. Officially. 

They seemed very unprepared for a reservation they knew about well in advance. I will not be coming back here Ever EVer EVER!!

Thought I was finished but it took our waitress forever to give us a check and when she finally did we didn't get the check book just a receipt which she shoved in her pockets. It took an additional 10 minutes for her to come back with it and when she did she handed back some one else's bank card. Luckily it was my sister who got mine but what the hell?!? Very careless and all she could say was \"well right area\". If gratuity wasn't forced on me she wouldn't have received anything from me. Not even the lent from my pocket. Very trifling rude and careless. Utterly ridiculous service. I never thought I would find myself ever wishing for another waitress but I guess there's a first time for everything!"}
