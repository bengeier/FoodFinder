{"text":"This place is such a great find! We came here because of yelp reviews and we weren't disappointed. The onion bhajia was AMAZING and the naan, as everyone else mentioned, was wonderful. The people who work here are incredible - super friendly, full of suggestions, and a few off-menu items that they wanted us to try. Several regulars came in while we were there - we'll probably become regulars too!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Awesome food. Awesome hospitality. The owner is very kind and the food is delicious. Authentic north Indian food. Loved this place. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you are looking for original quality curry food...look no further!  Worth the drive from the Toronto Pearson International Airport!  Great service! Great food! Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! So happy this placed opened up so close to my house. We ordered a bunch of things to try. The Saag Paneer was great... Probably the best I've had. Each dish was so good and I would highly recommend anything on the menu. Owner is super friendly and nice. Will definitely be ordering from here again"}
{"text":"Where do I start 
The pakora was delicious but that green sauce hit the spot
The butter chicken was the most flavourful I've ever had.
Garlic naan was yummy and they even had onion naan that my hubby loved. 
Channa they made with the perfect level of heat.
Portion sizes are so big that we took the rest to go and have enough for another meal!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with my wife based on the other positive reviews and was not disappointed! We ordered onion bhajia as a appetizer, chicken tikka masala, rice and naan. Everything was delicious, the service was great and they made us feel very welcome. The prices are very reasonable for the portion size. To top it off we had a nice chat with the owners and they brought us a dessert on the house. We will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Great Indian food. I ordered delivery and was thoroughly impressed with the quality and taste of all of the dishes. Saag paneer was great with lots of rich spinach flavour. Similarly the tika masala had great taste with more to it than most other standard versions. The highlight had to be the nice lamb biryani which had plenty of kick. 

I'll definitely be back. This is now my favourite local Indian restaurant. Only downside was that delivery took a while but I was appropriately warned when I ordered."}
{"text":"Great place we came across after looking for Indian Food in the west. Ordered the Butter Chicken, Plain Naan, and Garlic Naan. Buttern chicken was perfectly cooked white meat. Juicy and moist. Naan was freshly paid amd light and fluffy .. great. Would come back here to try their other dishes. Owner and cook are from Delhi .. hence Feast of Dilli!"}
{"text":"By far, my favourite Indian restaurant ever! This is a family owned and operated gem that fires out the freshest, creamiest, most exotic dishes I've ever had. The family is very friendly and we always feel so welcome. Even when there's no place to sit! 
The meat is amazingly succulent and tender. The biryani is sooo delicious (but spicy...hot hot hot). My must have dish is mulai paneer, the creamiest cashew sauce you can imagine....I can't get enough of it. The best butter chicken...the best onion bhajia...the best baingan bharta (minced roasted eggplant). Everything is the best. I love this food! When we feel like eating at home...takeout is no problem. Have a refreshing Indian beer while you wait. I do!"}
{"text":"A friend was in town, and mentioned a craving for Indian food.  Since we were headed to the west side of town, I looked up Indian restaurants and Feast of Dilli came up.  We decided to give it try.  Are ever glad we did!

We arrived after 1pm for lunch.  The restaurant was quiet, as there was a snow storm warning (yes, it was snowing, but nothing blizzard-like as described by the news).  We were the only table.  Tucked into a corner were two tables pushed together with two little boys lying on a sleeping bag and covered by a blanket, watching cartoons on a phone.  It was explained to us that they belong to the cooks, and the older brother was not feeling well.  (It was spring break, so no school.)

We ordered from the lunch menu: Onion Bhaji appetizer (4 pieces), Chana Masala, Paneer Mahkni, Butter Chicken.  Each lunch order was generous in size, and came with some tomato/cucumber salad;  raita, and rice.  Along with that was a basket of some of the best naan bread we've had - super thin, and buttered, fluffy and crispy.  I don't know if normally there would be a charge for extra naan bread, but extra was offered to us (which we gladly accepted).  Service by the host / server was friendly and attentive.

Our bill including tax came to $32!  Really reasonably priced!  We were happy to see a few takeout orders being picked up during our stay, so that we know they can be busy without the weather!

We would never have reason to come to Brown's Line - but now we would be willing to go out of our way to visit the restaurant again!"}
{"text":"1 hour and counting for delivery like 4 blocks away. Whatevs as long as the food is good and hot. 
.
.
.
The food is great! Really enjoying my saag paneer and even hubby who \"doesn't like Indian food\"  is loving the tandoori chicken wings and samosas. They probs don't have enough delivery people. Next time we'll pick up"}
{"text":"I'm new to the world of indian food, but I'm super excited to try everything on the menu here at feast of dilli. The chicken 65 was my favourite of the 4 dishes we've had so far - and the apps have all been great too! I can't speak to the authenticity, but I can speak to how friendly and inviting the owner is, and how delicious the food was! Awesome to have on the Browns line strip, best of luck from a new regular customer!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews, we had high expectations for this place and it didn't disappoint. Both the staff and the chef were friendly and recommended two dishes based on our preferences. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian I've tasted in Toronto. I've been living in the Toronto area for 12 years and I'm so happy this place is in my neighborhood. 

The Chicken Fritters were awesome. 

I called in a delivery order and the owner suggested I try their special of the day. I can't remember what it was called but I'm glad I took his recommendation. It was a delicious chicken dish. 

It's obvious these guys take great pride In their work. The owner usually personally delivers orders. 

I can't wait to try more off of the menu."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighbourhood.  And the food is delicious!  Best naan I've ever had.  So far we've tried the aloo ghobi, butter chicken, saag paneer, dal makhni, chana masala and chicken tikka masala.  Thoroughly enjoyed each one.  Be sure to try it if you want good Indian food at a really good price."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. We ordered the garlic naan, butter chicken, plain rice, and eggplant dish. We'd recommend all of them! Enjoy."}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant. 

Dal makhni and Kadai paneer are to die for! Very friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food ever! As an avid foodie and growing up with lots of Indian food this place is a legit gem! Great service,  kind people... and most importantly. . Amazing food!!  Pakora, butter chicken,  onion naan, curry goat  10/10. Location is also convienant and really easy to get to.  Will be back.... Tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered two lunch specials:

-Chicken Vindaloo
-Butter Chicken
-Garlic Naan

Food was well portioned, timely and delicious.
Vindaloo was appropriately hot and tender.

Butter chicken and was tender and juicy.

Naan bread was a unique, delicious and great appetizer.

Regards to Chef Jaipal.
The waitstaff completed the experience, and were extremely friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've got a couple favourite Indian restaurants in the city that I'm willing to drive to, but this one I can walk to and I'm so happy for that.

The food is delicious. Some of my favourites are: 

 - Vegetable Samosa
 - Chicken Pakora
 - Chana Masala
 - Paneer Makhni
 - Aloo Gobhi
 - Garlic Naan"}
{"text":"This is one the best authentic Indian restaurant in Toronto. This is my second visit but this time it was with the wife who is very particular and hard to impress, but she loved it.

The service: it was excellent. The chief came in and greeted us and made us feel comfortable and offered suggestions and explained the dishes.

The food: the food was probably one of the best authentic Indian food I have ever had. 

Portions are very good. We had chicken thikka masala with biryani and some spicy chicken curry that the chief brought on top of our order. 

If you are in Etobicoke and crave Indian food this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We came to this place in search of excellent homemade Indian food in a quaint, unpretentious spot - and boy, did Feast of Dilli deliver. The food is simply outstanding in taste, but also inexpensive and plentiful. My wife and I split two vegetarian orders and one meat order, along with two beers, naan and rice, and despite our ravenous appetites and how good everything tasted, we had enough leftovers for another full meal the next day.

The staff, while busy, are very friendly and clearly working hard constantly. It seems like they're a small team and could probably use another waiter to assist dine-in customers, but you can't knock the hustle of this family-owned spot.

Speaking of family, we had a periodic dinner guest in who appeared to be one of the staff's children. This may perhaps be off-putting to some customers, but we didn't mind him showing us his Ben Ten Watch and Spiderman Shoes. Consider it a quaint addition to the charm of this delightful hidden gem."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant Friday night after reading numerous yelp reviews. The restaurant was very busy. There was one person taking orders for the whole restaurant. He did his best to keep up with each guest. Food was great but next time we will do take out."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from that restaurant 4 times. Every other time I try different items from the menu and have never been disappointed with anything. The food has so much flavor and filled with tastes and spices. Yummy"}
{"text":"I am so pleased to have Feast of Dilli open for business near to my home. I had a wonderful lunch here and I will be returning. Soon!

I was immediately greeted by Jaipal, owner and chef, who made us comfortable and explained there would be some intermittent testing of the fire alarms (we were the first and early customers this particular morning, so it was understandable). He then was back in a couple minutes to deliver some complimentary papadums (which came with two amazing dips).

After a few minutes, the General manager, Prashant, pleasantly introduced himself and took our orders. Throughout our meal we were visited by both men at perfectly appropriate times to check on how were enjoying our meal and to see if we needed anything else. The service and hospitality were an easy 5/5.

We all shared the following:

Appetizer Chicken Pakoras - Wonderfully tender, mildly spiced (marinated) chicken breast chunks in a very light coating. 5/5

Appetizer Tandoori Wings - Great, large drumette portions of the wing in a tasty tandoor sauce. These looked incredible and my only complaint is that they appeared as they would have packed a flavour whallop but they were actually quite mild. 4/5

Chicken 65 - Quite easily the most complex tasting of the dishes we had, this unique dish had lightly coated and fried pieces of chicken in quite a spicy, slightly sour sauce. It's flavour, to me, is reminiscent of Hakkan Chili Chicken. 5/5

Lunch Special Butter Chicken (served with Salad, Raita, Basmati Rice and Naan) - A very hearty portion of tender chicken breast chunks together with sliced pepper pieces in a rich, buttery and pleasantly sweet sauce. Plenty of extra sauce to slather the perfectly cooked Basmati Rice and dip the incredible Naan into, (best naan I've ever had). 5/5

Lunch Special Tikka Masala (served with Salad, Raita, Basmati Rice and Naan) - Not too different than the butter chicken, this too had tender chunks of white meat together with green and yellow pepper pieces in a nicely spiced, slightly sweet curry. Not as rich as the Butter Chicken, and that was perfect. A slight complaint was that we had asked for it to be very spicy and it was rather mild. Again the Naan and Basmati were perfect and the Cucumber Salad and Raita were a very nice, cooling compliment. 4/5

All in all this was a very enjoyable meal for all of us. With the amount of food we ordered, we had plenty to take home (which was quickly devoured). It was very reasonably priced for such a large amount of food. I am truly hopeful (and confident), that the team will be able to keep up the quality of food and service as Feast of Dilli ages. I'm certain it will age here as it became quite busy by the time we left, even in an area greatly in need of commercial gentrification where other restaurants have failed.

I look forward to my next visit. The menu is quite large and there are several options to choose from. I stuck with the safe items on my first visit and since they were all amazing, I'll be sure to be more adventurous next time. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"After eating Indian food every 2 weeks for the last 10 years, this is the best Indian meal I've had! Great recommendation, amazing naan and delicious entrees. Next time I'm in this area, I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Fantastic food, had Dal, kadhai paneer, tandoori roti and peas pulao. 

Service very friendly and it feels like a family owned restaurant. 

Felt I was back home!"}
{"text":"From fives stars to consistently positive reviews on yelp, and Facebook, we decided to hit the road from central Toronto to arrive at this little joint on the Brown's line. We were curious, a bit hesitant (being that we have never heard of this place before and it is located in a very atypical place), but we were hungry and on a budget. We walked in and right away we were greeted with a big smile and a welcoming gesture to take a seat. The place was small but it was clean and the owner took good care of the place. The chef came out to chat with me for a bit, welcome us for coming all the way from central Toronto. He let me know about his new restaurant and how he really wants people to taste good quality Indian food that's made with love and care. It was quite evident how much he cared about what he was serving and he came by a few times to receive feedback from us.

Food & Price: The food was mouthwatering, fresh and tasted amazing. Three times the size of my head the naan is out of the world and you'll know when you come here. The price for curries was extremely affordable in comparison to  a lot of the mediocre Indian food they serve in restaurants in downtown Toronto. 

With the great price and food and all around kind people managing the restaurant, we are sure to come back!"}
{"text":"Le pire restaurant de ma vie, soupe horrible, plat sale, restaurant avec des enfants du restaurateur qui se promènent pied nu dans la salle à manger.  Aucun goût ce matin je me suis réveillé avec un mal de ventre incroyable . Fini tous les restos indiens"}
{"text":"OMG! One of the best Indian restaurants I've been to EVER. Fresh. Not greasy. Owners are very passionate and enthusiastic about serving you. When we ordered naan bread, they gave us this one HUGE garlic naan. It was probably the best naan bread I've ever had. Pillowy, soft, with layers.

Anyhow, I'm really encouraging you guys to try this place. It's awesome. Prices are good too. Very affordable. Not pretentious."}
{"text":"OMG!  Died and gone to heaven yummy huge fresh naan and butter chicken lunch $8.95 + tandoori wings 2.95 (2).    I could have licked the bowl!  Delish !"}
{"text":"Great food! I've ordered takeout of butter chicken and upgraded to garlic naan. So tasty, fresh, and generous portion also!"}
{"text":"Fully bellies from a very tasty meal. Each dish came with large portions and amazing spice/flavour. Very friendly and prompt service with a more than reasonable bill at the end. Will be going back on the regular for sure!"}
{"text":"I found my new favourite Indian restaurant! 

We went during lunch and they had a lunch special menu that is a sweet deal: \"served with Salad, Raita, Basmati Rice and Naan\". I believe this is a family-owned restaurant which makes it charming. 

Start with their tomato soup! It must be the dash of cream that makes this heavenly soup so unique. It has a sweet tang and wonderful blend of spices that's perfect for the cold weather. 

We also started with the onion bhajia, a light appetizer which was crispy and rich in spices.

I usually opt for the vegetarian dishes when I'm eating Indian food and this time I ordered the Matar Paneer. The flavour and spices were on point! It had a little sweetness that pulled the taste of the paneer and peas together.

My friend had the Chicken Vindaloo which is a dish known for its spiciness. It was too spicy for me but they did give pretty generous portions. 

I definitely want to come back again and try their biryani."}
{"text":"This place is always such a treat! The family atmosphere and the food quality is outstanding. The fact that the price is so reasonable makes this place a hidden gem in south Etobicoke! Do go and check it out - it's well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Best. Indian. Food. In. Toronto.

If you want melt in your mouth Naan and tikka masala that will change your life this is where you need to eat."}
{"text":"We decided to try the Feast of Dilli after passing it a few times as we live quite close. I went with my folks and family. 
 
For the six of us (4 adults, 1 kid, 1 toddler),we ordered a couple of starters (names escape me - the fried onions and the lentil ball). 
These were delicious. 
For mains we had the butter chicken, the chicken korma and the okra.  All were fantastic. We had leftovers with two appetizers and three mains. 
The naan were superb. 

My folks are quite picky when it comes to any food, Indian food in particular (being of East Indian descent), and was quite skeptical at the start. By the end, it will likely become his \"go to\" Indian restaurant. My kids ate all the butter chicken and chicken korma we gave them. They enjoyed it thoroughly. Myself - I found everything to be tasty and in perfect portion sizes. The prices quite reasonable. 
Highly recommend this restaurant. It will become our \"go to\" Indian food place as it's delicious, well priced and close by."}
{"text":"I am giving 3 stars because Naan were very good - freshly made and taste of curries was nice
However what kills the experience is the fact that most of the dishes seems to be microwaved from frozen condition. Had they been fresh, taste would have been very good...
Service was good, the owner was working himself with a smile to serve customers. But the food is expensive for the quality.
As this is a new place, I hope that with experience they will improve the food logistics to make it fresh and reduce the pricing."}
{"text":"Ordered an array of different dishes the delivery guy didn't except debt but offered to drive me to the bank . Amazing to know how far this place will go for there customers. 
The food was epic,tender,delicious and flavorful. 
Highly recommended indian cuisine i couldnt be more happy everthing was on point and steaming hot when delivered. 
You will definitely not be disappointed ordering or dinning here ."}
{"text":"This is a great find! We ordered takeout, had the Saag Paneer and Butter Chicken, both were excellent. Naan, perfect."}
{"text":"We have been ordering take out from this place pretty steadily about twice a month, and 9 times out of 10 their food is very tasty, well balanced and not too greasy. 

We tried the dessert once (Gulab Juman) and I have to say it was dissapointing- not light and moist- seemed very dense. Room for improvement there for sure.

Having said that, I can't give it any less than 5 stars because this family run restaurant is passionate about making great food, and I sincerely hope our neighbourhood supports this place so it can remain for years to come."}
{"text":"Been here already for three times with my friend and can't wait to go again and try different food on the menu. 
So far the best in the west end. Hands down. .....

A couple of weeks have passed and I come here regularly.... like every day. :)


Lamb Madras and lamb korma will cause massive release of endorphins ;) 
My friend has other preferences. lol"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Portions were average. Everything very tasty. Very tender with perfect amount of spice. Fish curry amazing. Naan VERY delicious. Butter chicken very delicious. The man at the front very friendly and polite. Very nice place."}
{"text":"Order was lost by the time we arrived. 
Spent almost an hour waiting inside, plus time wasted prior. 
The quality of food was good, but in the pricey side."}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurants I have been to!!!! Best customer service and the chef is beyond amazing! I will never go to another Indian restaurant. Their food is made to order and always fresh and with a lot of flavour. 
I definitely recommend everyone to try this place!"}
{"text":"Good food, the chef and the host make you feel welcome and the food did not disappoint as well.."}
{"text":"I didn't get to actually try the food so this is solely based upon my attempted delivery order. 
First, I am out of the delivery area, but there were such wonderful reviews on Yelp so I would've hauled myself off my deck out of the sunshine to go pick it up. 
So then I asked for shrimp korma. 
No sir. We don't have it.
Wat. But what do you have of korma? 
Chicken, etc. korma
k, so what do you have of shrimp?
Shrimp curry, etc.
k, so you can make me a shrimp korma?
No sir. We don't have it. Sorry.
well okay then... thanks anyway.. click.
:-S
wtf. 
2* for dude apologizing I guess."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Had a feast with friends and ordered about 7-10 different items, all fantastic! Definitely the best Indian food I've ever had. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing Food.... we ordered saag chicken and Daal.../
All dishes price right ... Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The food is exceptional.  Frugal foodies this is the place for you! 

Facilities could use some work, so try to hold off judgment until you've eaten!"}
{"text":"After numerous recommendations from friends, we decided to try this brand new restaurant with the family. I ordered Aloo Gobi, my husband ordered Vegetable Biryani and we got Chicken Tikka Masala for the kids, also asked for garlic and plain naans and their Kiingfisher beer. 
Everything we ate had a lot of flavour (my usual complaint at other local Indian restaurants is that the dishes are bland and flavours are too \"safe\"), Feast of Dilli was a huge surprise, we all loved what we ordered!"}
{"text":"Great little place! I've been meaning to try it for a while now so we decided to call in an order for take away. I arrived to pick it up a bit early and had a chance to sit and get a feel for the place (the person at the front brought me out a little bite to nibble on while they finished making our order...a nice touch for sure!).

The ambiance for dining in was simple and sparse - no cozy seating or soft lighting - but the place was clean and bright. Clearly a family-run operation with their 2 young children roaming the restaurant. While it might not be my first choice for a dinner out, we were very happy with our order. The food was delicious and we felt we got good value for our $ (which isn't always the case with Indian food). We will definitely be ordering from them again - especially now that we know they deliver within the area."}
{"text":"OK, so here's the deal.  I actually loved the food here.  Everything was fresh and flavorful.  The person behind the counter was friendly.  But I would NEVER eat-in again.  When we drove up their were small children playing in the back parking lot, then once inside I noticed a wall that had crayon writing all over it.  Then to my surprise the small half naked children who were playing in the parking lot were now inside with the customers.  The continued to play and romp around half naked.  At one point I looked up and saw a child's bare bottom, which may have scarred me for life.

This is a good place to get to go food from, but not a place to sit and dine in."}
{"text":"Food was good but atmosphere was lacking.  
The owner's kids were running around the restaurant screaming during our entire meal.  At one point the 5yr old picks up a broomstick and starts whacking the walls and windows.  The mom tries to take it, the kid goes ballistic, and the kid keeps the stick.  This went on for 30 mins with the owner just half-smiling.  
If the food was bad I would've walked without paying."}
{"text":"TIP:  If you can't find any parallel parking in front, there's free designated parking behind building!
 
Fresh, homemade Indian food that's not too greasy or salty.  I could tell because I didn't have mud-butt afterwards!  Many Indian restos makes my stomach turn (lactose/too oily?) and Feast of Dilli, didn't, so it passed my test.  :)

Strengths:
-  friendly service with a smile!
-  food arrived relatively quickly after ordering
-  fluffy naan (HUGE, fresh from oven, beautiful texture)
-  gravies (both Butter Chicken & Vindaloo sauces tasted distinctly different.  In particular the Butter Chicken gravy was really good!)

Meh:
-  coriander chutney that came with papadums (I've had better)
-  Mango Lassi ($2.95, tasted weird too me, a bit too acidity/sour.  It actually bubbled over like a mini volcano soon after it arrived on the table) - unless they change their recipe, SKIP IT!
-  presentation made it seem as though the portions weren't that big.  They used basic white bowls, the ones you'd find at Chinese restaurants, to separate the raita, main, and just threw rice/salad on a plate.  Could've been better & more authentically presented on those one of those stainless steel thali trays.

I'd definitely visit again if I was up for an Indian without any hesitation!"}
{"text":"superb food.....had a great time....
do try chicken, lamb ,naan....everything is superb..........
chief...u r a boss sir........
extremely friendly staff........
best Indian restaurant in the area no doubt....
keep the good work going............
keep it up guys.................................."}
{"text":"We were a little suspicious with so many good reviews, but it is indeed great authentic food. Ambience is ok, but the chef & server are so warm, And as an Indian I can attest that food items all are in-fact as authentic and yum as can be."}
{"text":"Second time. Great Lamb curry and garlic Nan. 
Needed a great Indian Restaurant in Etobicoke.
This is it !"}
{"text":"Omg. Finally came here after my aunt recommending it and seeing it on yelp

SO GOOD. And fresh!! The owner even came by mid meal and was so happy to hear how much we loved the food. I feel like our cleaned off plates also spoke volumes ahah we couldn't stop eating.

We got kebab, garlic naan and butter chicken. We wanted to order more but we were too full 

Most definitely come here for amazing Indian food that's fresh and cooked truly with care. It does take some time but it's because it's cooked to order. Also their kids were running around but he explained theyre on summer vacation. We didn't even care but if ur not the type to deal well just be aware."}
{"text":"Very inauthentic flavors, besides being spicy. Tomato ketchupy, sweet--that's not how matar paneer tastes. Not the authentic version anyway. Too much colour added to dishes. Very average kebab platter. Slow service. 

In a city that's finally blossoming with high quality authentic Indian food and contemporary Indian food, there are many other places to try."}
{"text":"Delicious! Food was fresh and you can tell they cook with pride. Portions are large (I will be eating leftovers for days) and prices very reasonable. The people running it are so polite friendly and accommodating."}
