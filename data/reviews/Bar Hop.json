{"text":"Excellent beer selection and decent food- definitely worth a try if you enjoy your beers"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but a little small bar.  The speciality cocktails are good and old fashion is a must try."}
{"text":"Nice service! My friend I was with didn't like her drink and they made and named \"special\" one just for her! Average bar prices (white wine $9.50, margarita $12)."}
{"text":"The location is fine but the service needs work. No Amber beer. No cider. No menu substitutions (can't add cheese to the beef dip?!). It appears they are still working out the kinks. We enjoy the location on King and hope that the management can improve the service here."}
{"text":"So goood! Amazing selection of beer (no surprise here), but the food is also great! We had some delicious pork buns and the brisket sandwich, plus some small things like scotch olives and an amazing peach salad with goats cheese. Good fries too. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great beer selection (and whiskey), great service. I can't believe it's average rating is so low. There's always a wait, because it's good!"}
{"text":"This place is good for a drink or several. Two floors which means plenty of space. The food menus is gastropub style, but overpriced.  We had the \"sharable\" pig head nachos which arrives as half of an actual pig head with just the cheek available for scooping out, and is served with crisps that are too fragile to use as scoops. It was not worth the money. The atmosphere and drinks are why I would return. But if you like the beer but want something to eat go to the King and spadina location."}
{"text":"Plenty of choices of beers, friendly staff. The rooftop was closed for weather, but the second floor was the place to be. The noise level may have bothered some, but it's a bar. Enjoyed a few beers, no food. Someone next to me got a burger with PB on it which smelled amazing."}
{"text":"Beers are the reason. Quite stiff staff when you ask for something compromise the experience. Call ahead and they push you away. Hello TO!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a drink when you are in the area. Rooftop patio is well appointed with ample beer and cocktail selections. Service also deserves a nod."}
{"text":"absolutely exquisite beer selection:  1 Cuvee Des Jacobins Rouge (bottle) = MY SOUR BEER ADDICTION. imported from Belgium, this beaut has everything and more you could ask from a sour.   2 Le Trou du Diable (on tap) - apple brandy barrel aged beer = face melting layers of flavour  so much love for these guys"}
{"text":"Normally, I'm not one to give 1 star to any place as long as they put food in front of me. However, if I've had a bad experience when dining, this would be the worst ever. So let's start at the wait list part of the night. A couple friend of or got a table for 4 and were waiting for us. We get there and the security guy says they're at capacity despite our friends having 2 empty seats at the table. Whatever though, I understand you have to abide by fire laws. So we waited and a group of 4 were before us. As soon as a group of 4 left, they got seated and then we were next. So we continue wait another 35 minutes. So a group of 3 people leave and as we are getting ready to get in, the security guy says another group of 4 were before us. WAIT WHAT. We were definitely the only people waiting after that group of 4 went but magically these people were waiting before. I assume this group knew the bouncer. I let that one slide. Then these two guys come in and one of them was clearly dating the waitress, and they say hi. So obviously they just walked in, they'd be behind us. So a couple people leave, and the security guy now tells us these two guys were here before us. Are you frikkin kidding me? The only reason we stayed around because we wanted to meet our friends we hadn't seen in a while. I will never go back here and neither would a I recommend it to anyone. The service the worst ever. There are so many better place you can try for craft beer. The food is over priced. Just the worst place in Toronto."}
{"text":"Managed to find this cool spot just walking around. Cool place with a nice roof top patio. Bartenders were nice but not very conversational. A lot of choices for drinks but a limited food menu.   Over all I'd give it a 4 out of 5 :) Had a great time enjoying the sunshine after the game!"}
{"text":"Been back a few times since it opened and have to move it up a star. The beer list remains solid with some decent selection of imports and the food has  stepped up nicely - the burger, mushroom app, vegan dishes, fried chicken, etc... Glad to see this place turn it around."}
{"text":"Worst service I've had in a very long time. It started with an argument with my friend that he's not allowed to put a lemon in his beer because it will \"ruin the glass\". We moved upstairs to the patio. Waitress forgot my drink. Which is fine, it happens from time to time. But then also forgot my fries for like an hour and a half. And then proceeded to give me stink eye for the duration of my stay. Wait. What? You're mad at ME because you forgot my order??!? Find a new line of work. Gave them a 2 because the fries were good and the other server was nice."}
{"text":"I come here for the mussels. Don't expect great service or to eat in a private eating area. It's busy and loud! Which, in my books, is great. Servers - usually 2 - often have massive sections so it helps (them and you) to know what you want so you can place your order efficiently when they come round."}
{"text":"I've been here few times for drinks. I've eaten there once for dinner and once for lunch. The rooftop bar is really lovely in the summer - highly recommend. The food is not life changing, but it's definitely good. I've had the mussels, fried chicken and the chicken pot pie - all were food. Pot pie was the best. Overall, nice place for a date or a few drinks. If you get hungry, the food will not disappoint."}
{"text":"A poor alternative to its namesake on king, do yourself a favour and wait for the king version to free up a table."}
{"text":"This place is so hit or miss. We brought friends here and experienced TERRIBLE service. We were so embarassed for  bringing them here.  Our waiter was... Drunk? High? He was super slow and had slurred speech. It was hard ordering anything. Then he messed up the beers, and when we commented about it he started sticking HIS NOSE inside the cups!! Like TOUCHING the inside of the rim with his nose, and tipping the cup in a way that the liquids touched his nostrils a bit. He was trying to tell if he'd served the wrong beer or not.  The food that night was awful too. The phily bomb was SO tiny and bad."}
{"text":"I prefer this location over the location on King st.    This is a brand new Bar Hop at Queen and Peter and has 3 floors, top floor being a nice patio. I came here thurs after work for a few drinks and they have an assortment of craft beers, specialty beers, and other alcoholic beverages.  They also have a nice menu of unique foods at very reasonable prices.  I tried the bone marrow poutine ($12), lettuce wrap with poached tuna (not canned) ($13) and pepperettes, ($9).  It was pretty busy for a thurs night, but they were able to accommodate as, as we moved between the 2nd floor and the patio.  Great place, I'd definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Looking for the most amazing patio downtown? Look no further than the newest location of Bar Hop! Rooftop patios are where it's at this summer and this place has one of the raddest ones I've been to in a while.   I'm all about their beer selection too. If you're looking for a place to grab a drink after dinner or before the Jays game totally hit this place up! The selection is amazing and you can never really go wrong with the specials on tap. Beware though- If you do go on a game day this place is paaaacked, so get there early if you want to catch some sunny rays.   Cheers and see you on the roof !"}
{"text":"Tons of great beers on tap. Great vibes in the summer upstairs. Food is your basic pub fare with a little flare."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for drinks and food. Excellent beer menu. One of the best in the city! Can't choose? Grab a flight! This location has a few different levels and a rooftop patio. Seats are very comfy. Has an updated, but old school pub feel.  Food is decent. Service is pretty good. They get VERY busy after a Jays game, so if that's your plan, leave the second the game is over! Great for groups!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to drink and chit-chat in downtown after work. Bar Hop Brewco might be another good choice for you. They offer 36 in-house brewed beers and almost 100 bottle beers. Their yummy snack are only $5-$9. This Bar Hop Location is their 2nd location located on Peter street. Luckily, they have a roof-top patio.  So it will be perfect for a sunny day.  However, we came here when it was still cold  and they haven't opened their patio yet.  It was our first time for this location.  We came late night on Sunday few weeks ago.  It was around 11 pm and it was packed!  No one seemed to want to leave the place early .  We waited for 15-20 mins before we got a chance to sit at a barrel table.  We actually had a barrel table when we got in.  A waiter suggested us to wait at the barrel table close to their bar but two guys who came in after us just walked there and sat right away when they saw it.  Ya..they saw us too but who cares right? They were pretty drunk before they even got in there.  I didn't want to argue with them because I dint think they could understand anything at that time .  So we just stood there and waited for another barrel table.  We ordered beers to start with and waited for almost another half an hour for a real table  that we could sit and eat.  I'm a big eater!   Food  Appetizer  - My luv  \"Pan Seared Mushrooms\"  It was delicious!  They were roasted with garlic and glazed with  porter  It was a generous portion with a $5 price.  If you love mushroom, you would love it!   - Pork Cracklings   One word \"Huge!\"  And only $5.  - BBQ Tertilla Chips $5 was worth money for its portion.  It was also good with beers.   Main  - Fried Chicken Sandwich $15.  It was fine for us but nothing was special.  We'd prefer big puffy butter fried chicken sandwich   Atmosphere   - Atmosphere was great and clean. The main floor was decorated with wood and beer barrels.  It was cozy but they have limited seats if they don't open their patio.  Service  -  Understand that its hard to expect a good service in bars.  However, Bar Hop always has a good name on its good service at the original location on King street.  So they catch up on that for this location too.  I saw two waiters running around the bar.  I wasn't sure if they short of staff!?  I hope they have more staff next time we come by.  OVERALL Experience :  We definitely come back! It is very close to my husband's work place  only 2-3 minutes walk."}
{"text":"Three words for you: PIG HEAD NACHOS.  I realize that this will not be a selling feature for some, but for me, it sealed the deal. Crispy tortilla chips with sour cream, guacamole and jalapeños with a roasted fried pig's head! They pull off a lot of the meat for you and there's a tangy vinegar sauce that adds some more seasoning. I ate the eyeball!  We also had the scotch egg and the chicharonnes. Proper bar food. Proper beer food.  Again, to echo my review of the original barhop, I am not a beer drinker, so I feel a little ripped off here. cocktails are small and very expensive. Wine is mostly local. But the server was nice enough to let me taste before I ordered. Overall the service was excellent with the exception of a rush that happened around 6:30, but he was patient with out eccentric friend who asked him if he wanted to hear a story. (Every server's nightmare... of course he doesn't want to hear your story-- he he's BUSY and probably doesn't care, anyway.) I expected some of the hipster-twattitude here, but thee was none. Of this, I am greatly appreciative.  The atmosphere was clean, aesthetically pleasing and overall it was a great experience.  I am curious about there being 3 bouncers at the door?? Really?  Anyway, a solid stop for a Friday after work. The place fills up fast. Don't bet on getting a table without a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"Bar Hop with a little elbow room.   Anyone that has crammed themselves into BarHop and put their name on the chalk board will appreciate an alternative location to enjoy some tasty beverages.  I just enjoyed the full chicken and I would congratulate myself on picking one of the tastiest things on the menu.  Homemade tasty hot(ish) sauce complemented the perfectly seasoned roasted chicken with Brussel sprouts to make you rationalize that you are eating healthy.  There were some new selections on the beer menu (after all that's why we are all here) but I would like to see them bring in some more random treats."}
{"text":"Love the location on king street. Tried Peter street several times and never again. Poor vibe downstairs but good  patio. There are better patios elsewhere.  Last try and done."}
{"text":"If you are like me and thought the original Bar Hop location was cramped, this is the right place for you! I ordered the fried chicken sandwich. The whipped avocado and sprouts really grounds the fried chicken, so that the meat's flavour does not overwhelm. I was also recommended a rhubarb based cocktail. It was super refreshing, athough all my friends made fun of me for the drink's pink colour...  The service was friendly and prompt. Definitely give this place a try when you're in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Just had a couple of beers here. My rating is for the service which was subpar. The server was not friendly and looked like she did not want to be there. Kinda spoiled our experience having a dark cloud like that walking around."}
{"text":"Tons of seating space with two levels and an upstairs patio. Highly recommend for groups or dates. A lot of craft beers to choose from, and their cocktails are good too. They're not overly sweet, and go down smoothly. One cocktail definitely got me buzzed. I ordered the open sesame. We also got fries and a chicken sandwich. The fries were awesome, real potato, with a buttery tasting mayo sauce I think on the side. I kind of wish I knew about all the specials from our server. It's quite difficult to read the chalkboard in the dark."}
{"text":"Only came for drinks with a group and we only stayed for about an hour before heading off to dinner.  The selection of beer is pretty impressive considering they have large format bottles to choose from so it can feel like you're cracking open a champagne bottle when really you're having a really large special beer instead.  You can put together your own flight if you want and there's a flavor, taste and color for everybody.  No food consumed so this rating is strictly on the service and variety of choices available."}
{"text":"The food is quite good but the reason I keep coming back every time I am in town is for the wonderful selection of craft beer. It's not just the quantity of options, but also the quality. I've rarely been disappointed and I'm usually ordering flights."}
{"text":"Fantastic place!  Beer selection is amazing, food is great.  Sure it's bit loud at night for my liking as I prefer the chill kind of vibe usually, but for what it is it's a must to visit for all beer lovers."}
{"text":"The beer selection was fantastic. The service was less than stellar. I asked for the WiFi password and was able to connect but the service was down. Then at the end of my visit they added an appetizer that I didn't order to my bill and the server seemed annoyed when I told her there was a mistake.   I arrived just before the patio became super busy and I only had a couple beers. I got the feeling I was just taking up space when they got busy and I was taking a table. Nice selection of beer and the food smelled amazing but I didn't feel appreciated as a customer."}
{"text":"Super small but I love this place!!! The music and ambiance brought me back in time.  Very small place so the tables are crammed together. So its comfy cosey if you know what I mean. Very interesting cocktails and reasonably priced for amount of alcohol. Would like to go back again to try all the cocktails"}
{"text":"I think that Barhop Peter St definitely deserves 5 stars, and let me tell you why...  First: The service... Whether it's Jamie who meets and greets you at the door, or Devin or Krista or any of the other lovely people that work there to take care of you, everyone is on point!   Second: The beer... The selection is incredible! They've got something for everyone... Even if you don't drink beer, there's a beer for you. I love beer, but there is this one that they carry, Redline Leather Interior Vanilla Almond Brown Ale... Can't find it anywhere else and it makes me lose my $#!+ when I see it on the rotating menu... Definitely worth checking out!  Third: THE FOOD!! Do yourself a favor and get the Venison Tartare. You'll be really glad you did!!!!  Fourth: The value! You get a lot without having to pay a lot. Food portions are great and you can drink craft beer without paying insane craft beer prices!   Check this place out and have a great time! You may have to wait depending on when you go... But it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Went on a Monday with a friend of mine and had a few beers. The staff are really nice and the basket of fries is huge. They also have a good selection of alcohol so take your pick. They also have open Mic night on Monday so we heard some great local talents. All in all pretty awesome place to be"}
{"text":"Its Friday night and we were looking for a new bar. This is a cozy hipster-ish bar with a quite large selections of craft beers. They also serve hard liquors here.  Music is upbeat. Wooden decor. Service is lacking though and waiters need to be a bit more attentive."}
{"text":"Before I begin, please note that I am only reviewing Bar Hop as a bar, as I visited after having eaten a huge mountain of poutine elsewhere and so did not try their food. I came here during a 7-hr layover en route from South America to the US, and it is the first and only bar I have ever visited in Canada (this was my first trip up north). That being said, I can definitely say that this place is great. Not only is their OWN beer incredibly tasty (they seem to specialize in funky, exotic saisons and farmhouses from what they had on offer yesterday [Feb. 3, 2018]), but they have a great selection of Ontario brews (and expensive bottles from Belgium). They don't do flights, per se, but they do offer 5 oz pours so that you can try a lot. This rivals the best craft beer bars I've been to in the midwestern US (in beer quality, atmosphere, and variety), and I highly recommend it for a long Toronto stopover (as well as to local craft beer enthusiasts)."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers, open late during the week, and solid snacks! Nothing much more to say about this place. We had a late night snack of veggies, tapenade, and cheese with a beer flight. It was our first night in town and not a bad way to kick off the trip."}
{"text":"Bartender was disappointing.  Not only did she use the measuring cup for a whiskey on the rocks, she used the small end, which made for a pathetic drink for $8.  If you want a decent pour for your money, this is not your place - really irritating (see the example photo, which is a bloody Mary.  Very skewed ratio of vodka to Mary.)  Which goes to show how good the bone marrow poutine was (photo).  Seriously the best thing I ate in the entire country of Canada.    If they poured a decent drink, it would have been 5 stars."}
{"text":"Having been to both their locations, their Peter street is definitely my favourite. The space here is much bigger, so you're not sitting elbow to elbow with your neighbour.   They also have more food options from snacks/appetizers to full entrees. You also have the same extensive menu of beers to choose from.   It's a great place to hangout with friends for a couple hours."}
{"text":"Omg the service is terrible, worst day of my life. Apparently we need to buy a drink with our oysters (which I'm not drinking), I've been here so many times and no one ever told me to buy a drink before. I ordered like 40 oysters, like come on. It's just the way she told me to buy a drink is soooooo rude. Will never comeback"}
{"text":"We made an unplanned visit to Barhop Brewco, it's been on my bookmark for a while now and I was really impressed! For a place in the middle of the Richmond/Queen/Peter/John area, this place had good food and a great beer list! And such a great location too. I will definitely be back and can't wait for their rooftop patio to open in the summer (undoubtedly will be a big line-up!)"}
{"text":"Great place! Great servers! However , the great ones are at the other branch. The ones who served us today were a bit weird and lacked judgement ."}
{"text":"Great bar with super friendly and attentive bartenders! We were visiting Toronto for a long weekend and I'm so glad I found this spot. They had a really large beer selection and what looked like a great food menu. We didn't get to eat here but the beers were awesome! We tried \"octopus wants to fight\" lol that's the best beer name ever, I believe it was an IPA. Another cool thing is that when we were visiting other places and asking for recommendations, a lot of bartenders told us to come here! This seems like a popular spot amongst the locals!"}
{"text":"I'm having a hard time figuring out why I wouldn't give this place 5 stars. The King Street location is probably my favourite beer bar in the city, and with this new location it adds an increased capacity while still offering a great selection of craft beers to drink.   The main floor is a more sporty pub vibe similar to their original location, as there is various sizes of small group sized tables and a bar for seating, with TVs strategically positioned with sports on for viewing needs. There is also an absolutely beautiful reclaimed wood wall that adds a nice warmth to the room. There is also a second floor which is a bit more of the group setting and restaurant vibe, sans the TVs and bigger booth styled tables to choose from. Later this year, they are slated to open a rooftop patio for your outdoor drinking needs as well.  As for the menu, there are what I believe to be 36 taps plus a few \"special taps\" which on this visit even included a non-alcoholic rootbeer on tap. I admittedly came here after dinner so didn't need to eat any food but was impressed by a few things I saw on the menu. Instead, we indulged in the tequila menu which had a lovely variety of options at what I would define as pretty standard pricing for such items.  Service was adequate and friendly during my visit, so I can't help but give this place the exact same rating as their King Street location. 5 stars for all Bar Hops!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Excellent menu. Breezy patio. Try the chicharron - huge and crackly."}
{"text":"The food is great, basing this one on the New Years Eve visit, great special menu had the oysters, the fried chicken sandwich and the lobster steak special, tried the special recommendations for NYE on their beer list. Always an impressive variety of beers on tap, and in bottles if that's your thing.  We had bar seating, but it really emptied out on the 1st floor long before midnight. As a NYE location I'm not sure how great it is, but as a food beer spot it's pretty on point. Service is adequate but not always quick to come around and check in, be that for food satisfaction or to see if you need another drink. Hence the missing star, if it was slammed I'd get it but that's not often the case. However it remains a great place for getting something to eat with an above average selection of beers to go with it."}
{"text":"Had a tough time picking a star rating for his place.  Came here after work to grab a couple of drinks and dinner.  The beer selection is excellent.  Ordered steak frites, mostly because I couldn't figure out what I wanted to order.  When I ordered my second beer, the runner brought the wrong one.  When I told her, she walked it back to the bar.  My waitress picked it back up, put it in front of me and told me it was what I had ordered.  Didn't think much of it because it was still a nice beer and carried on with my evening.  When the bill came I'd been charged for 4 beers, which they corrected easily, but when I looked at the bill I saw that the incorrect drink HAD been punched in (so... Didn't get the beer I ordered, still ended up with a good beer).  My main issue with this place is the service, but I think I would come back, but I'd sit at the bar to make sure I get the beer I actually want to try."}
{"text":"The first time I went I was blown away by the bone marrow poutine at the lunch service. The second time I went was dinner service and we ordered the bone marrow and the fish and chips. Wasn't as great.   This is mostly based on the food served. The poutine fell flat in comparison to the first time I had it. Could use some pickled shallots or something more acidic to cut through the fat. The poutine was a bit too salty as well.   The fish and chips were definitely not worth it. Dry as the Sahara desert. Fish were coated in cornmeal breading which doesn't really serve a purpose except leaving a gritty texture. Could be improved.   Service and drinks are decent. Good selection of craft ciders and beers."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on Victoria Day - the food and beer selection are fantastic. The pigs head nachos look amazing, and I want to try all the entrees!   Despite quality food and drink, the set up of the patio isn't great. The height of the tables does not align with the chairs.  I found it hurt my back after awhile.   Service here was also very slow. They were busy, but we waited almost 25 minutes to get our bill. I recommend off hours or going in a group that can command more attention."}
{"text":"The food never disappoints unlike many bars. Interesting beers on tap. There are 3 levels but fill up fast+very loud. Service is quite good but the servers take some time due to capacity. Other than that this is one of my go-to bars in dt. Try the bone marrow poutine and the bao!"}
{"text":"Went to bar hop on a Sunday night (due to lack of options open in the area) and it was seriously disappointing.  First the beer options are exhaustingly predictable for the Toronto hipster/pretentious world. Pretty much just complicated IPAs or weird wheat singing or the other. Not a single German or Czech beer. Not a single one! They're just the two biggest and oldest beer creators in the world. But clearly not \"interesting\"enough for bar hop  Secondly the food. It wasn't just mediocre, it was actively offensive to my mouth. Unfortunately we both ordered the \"steak sandwich\". It's in quotation marks because it's not really a sandwich, it's just a half baguette roll with bits of steak, some miss of green pepper and then melted cheese on top. sounds reasonable, right? Well, surprisingly you can actually mess up something that simple. The baguette roll was stale and soggy (how??), the bits of steak were just frozen cooked un-marinated and un-seasoned steak. That meat hadn't had even a dash of salt. The whole thing had just been microwaved, that's how the cheese was melted. If there was any doubt about how it had been cooked, they brought the food about two minutes after we ordered, so that tells you what you need to know. They actually brought the food before they even brought us our drinks. Somehow.  It was the type of food that you'd expect in a fast food sandwich place in a petrol station or something. But at entertainment district prices. The service was average. Our waitress was nice but the hostess who sat us was grumpy and seemed to be having a very bad day, and practically threw the ketchup bottle on the table when we dared ask for it. Oh and it took about 15 minutes to just get a beer.  Never going there again."}
{"text":"I was here last week with a  group of friends to just hang out.  I didn't have any of the food so I won't comment on that and this review is purely for the drinks and the service and ambiance.  This is a great location at Queen W and Peter St.  Overflow from the King St location.  Plenty of parking across the street and easily accessible by TTC.  It's all warm and cosy inside with lots of tables and they have a roof patio that I would love to try in the summer.  It's a great people watching location because Queen W is the best people watching locale in the city in my opinion.  Their drinks menu is certainly impressive and you will be sure to find something to suit your tastes - from the strong dark ales to the more lighter options.  It's a few pages long so definitely try a few drinks you wouldn't normally try - this is the best place to experiment.  The prices are fairly reasonable so bottoms up!   I tried the Peach flavour beer - yes I'm a fruity beer drinker and it definitely had hints of peach flavour which for me is perfect.  Ask your server and they can point you in the right direction."}
{"text":"A friend and I arrived at Bar Hop quite late; in fact were were actually on our way to our Airbnb until we stumbled upon an open door. Now, I know what you're thinking, why would we go into an open door? We canvased the area and determined that the bar was still open on the patio. We climbed the 3 flights and were welcomed in. We sat fairly close to the bar in a booth; and oh what a beautifully cool, crisp night it was.  We let the waiters/bartenders determine our drinks; we like beer, almost any kind of beer. After drinking silly bud lights all night, we wanted something with heft and flavor. After 3 different, but rich and delicious beers, we called it a night. The place is beautifully put together with a great atmosphere. Sitting outside with all the string lights and open air was wonderful. Perfect for a quiet conversation, a romantic date, or just a place to hang with a small group of friends. 5 out of 5 would drive from the US to come back."}
{"text":"When they didn't have the drinks I wanted on the menu (sex on the beach or a bellini- because I'm high maintenance like that) they came up with a new drink they thought I'd like which was awesome. Great service! Atmosphere was very good as well, fries could have been crispier."}
{"text":"was good.  service was a bit neglectful. beer menu is good. lunch was good.  I had the beef dip, wife had the tuna lettuce wrap, brother in law had the steak melt.  beef dip: flavourful, fatty, good, bread was crisp dip was good. tuna wrap reported to be a bit bland, poached tuna seems a sin to me. steak melt, looked like a standard Philly cheese steak.  3 stars cause it was a bit generic.  maybe it's more interesting at night."}
{"text":"The main floor of this location is fully wheelchair accessible, including automatic entry and fully to-code washrooms.  However, the main floor is not guaranteed to be open just because the establishment is open.  They often seem to open the second floor first, waiting a few hours to open the main floor.  You will need to call and confirm that the main floor is open before coming with a guest with mobility needs.    Beer selection is lovely, and the food is quite good."}
{"text":"I love the original BarHop outpost.  This one has only been open a week, so this is a preliminary review.  Surprised how packed it was right off the bat.  The beer list is relatively identical in number of choices and competition to the original location.  Lots of Toronto  and Ontario beers with a few American/Euro options sprinkled in.    The food was by and large the weak point.  The menu here is organized rather strangle.  There are some tapas style snacks (read small portions that aren't cheap), a few sandwiches that come without sides, and some large entrees that are meant to be shared.  We shared the Scotch Olives which were a massive fail...like a Scotch egg but an olive.  With the incredibly salty olives wrapped in salty sausage and then breaded in a salty coating I surely achieved my recommended daily intake of sodium in one bite.  We passed along feedback and couldn't finish them.  The sweetbreads were well-fried but a bit bland, and the sauce wasn't quite up to the challenge.  The brisket was the best of the night, but still a bit dry...not a beautiful succulent brisket you get in a proper bbq joint.  The rest of the menu has things like a fish that's almost $40 and a steak that was somewhere around the $110 mark.  Umm...who's going to buy a steak that costs that much from a place that doesn't specialize in steaks?    Our server was enthusiastic.  Food runners are still struggling a lot to get the right food to the right table and pacing is off, e.g. apps came at the exact same time as mains.    In any case, I still vastly prefer the food of the original Barhop, but I'll give this a chance to settle in an update my review."}
{"text":"A more relaxed version of the original Bar Hop on King, the space is cosy and is well stocked with the usual beer selections. We came after work on a weekday and the first floor was mostly empty with most tables relaxing and chatting over beers.   We grabbed a drink and shared the classic burger. The burger patty was perfectly cooked, with a nice pink centre.  Everything was good but nothing particularly stood out to us. A good option for a relaxed drink with friends."}
{"text":"I've had food and drinks here before on several, several occasions. Yesterday's lunch was just unacceptable.   We arrived shortly after 1pm. There were 2 other active tables going and 1 table of extremely boring workmates lingering after their lunch meeting.  We ordered an onion and ale soup, bone marrow poutine and their special of the day which was chicken pot pie. An order like that should take 10 minutes tops if you think about it - they are all basically pre-made aside from some frying, assembly and broiling (soup and bone). This order took 40  minutes or so. I gave myself a time limit of 45 minutes. They had 3 minutes left until I was gonna let my displeasure be known. Lucky for them.  When the food arrived,  there was no apology for the wait, there was also no spoon for my soup. I had to ask another server for a spoon. When she went to go look for one, the original server came back with a bunch of spoons. He should have told me he was going to be back with a spoon instead of leaving me hanging with a soup, no spoon and a scowl. Communication!  They took the tartare off the menu *sad face*, they also shrank their beer selections. I probably won't eat here again. Too bad. They had a good thing going. I bet they are under new penny pinching management or something."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Their patio upstairs is well ventilated and doesn't get too packed, making it a great place to hang out. As for their food, I've tried both their sirloin steak and their fried chicken burger. Both were excellent and I'm willing to say their steak is one of the best I've ever had! They've also got a great selection of beers and other alcoholic drinks to carry you in through the night ."}
{"text":"This place has a lovely rooftop patio. But its also one of those places that has a good location & nice patio and therefore doesn't try at all.  If I was just rating the food and being on a lovely patio I'd go 4 stars - but the service is bad. Not really bad, just indifferent. As in they couldn't give less of a **** if you like your food, want to order food, want another drink, etc. And when you're paying for a non-cheap beer and meal out you expect just a bit more."}
{"text":"S'alright. Great beer selection.   The sandwiches are are also okay don't come with sides but for 5$ you can get a big share portion of fries instead of paying 3$ per side per portion. I had the cassoulet but it didn't really click for me.   Service was kinda distant.   Conclusion: Go for beer and sandwiches."}
{"text":"It was ear-splittingly loud last evening, people screaming at each other to make themselves understood. Beer list is impressive, but they need to do something about the acoustics (or hand out earplugs at the door)."}
{"text":"a necessary extension of the original bar hop location.  three glorious floors of craft beer and plentiful seating.  however, it still gets packed here during peak hours.  in the summertime, the third floor rooftop patio is a must.  as usual, this place boasts a ton of rotating craft beer taps, plus ciders.  there really is a beer for everyone to try here.  craft beer newbies can look to the lagers and pale ales on tap, while the more seasoned craft beer drinkers would enjoy the sours, belgians, IPAs, and high-abv stouts here.  i don't usually eat where i drink (i try to find cheaper places for food), but the pork rinds here were meh while the fries were quite good.  i've had a few issues with the service being a bit slow, but that won't stop me from frequently visiting this place.  please check this place out"}
{"text":"The larger version of Barhop original..didn't even know that this existed until I tried to take my friend to the smaller version...Whig was packed and they brought me here!  As always great selection....a book of drinks bigger than the one page. menu of food is always aces in my book!!"}
{"text":"Before I say anything about this place, when you come here, immediately go to the rooftop. It's amazing here. It's got these great wood features and lights. Gives it somewhat of a NYC vibe (for those Americans reading this).  Bar Hop features 36 craft beers, so naturally I had to check a few out while I was here. The menu is pretty wide. They've got oysters, house jerkey, lamb corn dogs and much more that you'd want to check out.  Based on the time of day I was there, I could tell that this is a pretty popular, or should be popular happy hour spot in Toronto. Beers will run around $5-$9 CAD so it makes sense to me why it would be popular, plus again, that roof does wonders. Oh, and believe me, there is an inside too, and it's pretty huge. A few floors actually so if the deck is taken up which I'm sure it would be full quickly on a summer day, just kick back a few beers inside- no worries my friend.  Another thing I liked was that it was loud, but not so loud that I couldn't have conversation with my friend I was visiting with so that made me think it would be a nice date spot too.  Honestly, I just want to be on the rooftop with an IPA in my hand listening to all of those wonderful Canadian accents..."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection. I particularly like the selection of sour beer. However, don't come here for food. Many of the mains on the menu were not available. Given I visited at 7pm on a Saturday this is bad."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with coworkers on a Friday. FYI - they only take reservations via emaill/online and not within 24h of notice, but thankfully they were nice enough and were able to accommodate for a table of 9 right at noon the day of. The items on the menu sounded delicious but a bit pricy. I got the breakfast patty sandwich (sausage patty, kimchi, egg), which came with a side of salad. This tasted good but was way too small and not filling at all! Small sausage patty on an what was a English muffin, with one or two slices of kimchi. Compared to the other sandwiches I saw my colleagues get - fried chicken  or the steak, for what you're paying for you might as well get the bigger sandwiches. For the side salad, it was okay, but small portioned as well, and again for what you're paying for I'd recommend getting the fries instead. For $15, I would not recommend getting my sandwich. I heard good things about the fried chicken sandwich so I'd give that a try if you plan to go. However, the service and our server were excellent!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back - food is good,  service was lovely,  prices and beer selection were amazing.  Mango sour beer? Awesome! Co-brews with great Lakes are all great and Monday prices can't be beat.  Will be back in evening when the patio is open and to try the scotch olives. Really great concept"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer. The lounge upstairs was pretty chill.  I was supposed to go in (on the main floor) for dinner with a few friends but the front hostess gave an extremely inaccurate waiting time. We ended up staying in the lounge for close to 2 hours when the hostess finally came up and told us there was a table available. They ended up serving food in the lounge with one waitress working. Pretty unorganized and understaffed, but if you're going here just to drink then it's a pretty good spot."}
{"text":"I've been to BHB 4 times and the 1st 3 times I visited I was on a different level (main floor, then rooftop patio, then 2nd floor) each time.  On New Year's Eve a couple days ago I was at an Event with a Social Group on the 2nd floor which started in mid-afternoon.  I figure after 4 visits it's about time I posted a review of this great venue.  I've also visited Bar Hop's older location on King St.W. several times and I must say that I definitely prefer this location; with 3 floors and a different layout on each compared to the long, narrow layout of the King St. BH, it makes for a more comfortable experience when you can move around the floor more easily.  I haven't really eaten at BHB yet but of course I've had a beer(s) there each time and yes, the selection is always quite vast and stellar.  You can order different quantities, i.e. 13 oz, 18 oz based on the alcohol content (ABV) and/or type of beer.  The service has always been quite friendly and helpful when needed each time I've been.  As the location is pretty new and somewhat upscale, the venue presents a quite clean an inviting space to customers.  The roof top patio isn't huge but it has it's own bar and washrooms on the same level which is convenient.  If you're a craft beer lover or want to expand your beer horizons, I recommend you give BHB a try."}
{"text":"Gord and I went to Bar Hop Brewco for supper this evening.  It hasn't been open that long and I've been wanting to check it out.  Just the upstairs level was open.  Gord ordered the White Bean Cassoulet.  He's had it before there and really liked it.  I ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich (with mayo rather than avocado) with a side of fries ($3 extra).  It was okay.  It was boneless thigh meat so was tender.  There seemed to be a Buffalo wing sauce on the chicken.  They have a fun craft beer selection so beer geeks will like it there."}
{"text":"Went to Bar Hop Brewco for the first time yesterday and it is something else. Great atmosphere,  and warm ambiance.  Perfect place to go with some friends and have a few drinks.   Service was great and helpful when it came to selecting a beer.  Speaking of beer,  their list is huge and has amazing variety.  Definitely will find something you like.   My date and I ordered a few drinks and shared the fried chicken sandwich.  One of my drinks was a rye and ginger which let me down.  Couldn't taste the rye at all and was a bit of a let down. But it was only a tiny part of my night and doesn't hurt the overall aspect of the bar hop.   Th  sandwich was fantastic and would like to try more of their menu.   Overall this is a great spot for a date or if you just want to hang with some friends."}
{"text":"Nice little gastropub on peter st. with a wide Ontario brew selection on tab.  Foods are above average for a pub and feature some off the wall concepts (peanut butter burger, chicken pot pie baked on skillet, bone marrow poutine...).  I'd definitely go back.  Pint glasses are smaller."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place! If you are a craft beer / microbrew beer lover, this place is a must do!  There are about 30 local beers on tap, and the 4oz tasters are the best way to try as many as you can. Be sure to check out the board on the wall to see if there is a special cask being featured.  The food here is pretty good too, so this is a perfect place for dinner and drinks"}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of girls to cap off our bachelorette. Great vibe and lots of seating. Everyone was satisfied with their food. I was pleasantly surprised by my smoked trout and green beans. It's the perfect healthy meal to have if you don't want a green leafy salad. There are also eggs and sliced potatoes in the salad, so it's filling. My friends liked their bone marrow poutine. I tried the sword fish strips with fries. Excellent taste and texture. A great twist on traditional fish and chips. Server was also very attentive."}
{"text":"We were walkind down Queen looking for something to get into and BOOM! There it was, in all it's glory. With all the craft beer I could handle, I stepped in for a good time with my young lady who knows how crazy I am about local brew. Our bartender,  Andre was extremely knowledgeable about not only the beer but the area. It was our first time in Toronto and he made us feel welcomed. I enjoyed a several brews while checking them in on Untappd with others at the bar. Even made new friends! We will be stopping by this place every time we are in Toronto. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. Two thumbs up over here"}
{"text":"I don't usually complain but I arrived here shortly after lunch hours and decided to Sit at the main floor bar for a bite. Beer is great food not so much. The mood of the bartender was off serving me I could tell right away. I ordered fish and chips which were extremely bland and flavourless With a batch of dead fries, served with mayonnaise and ketchup. When I asked if they had any other sauces like tartar or even tobasco, I was presented with a bunch of local sauces (that I never asked for).  I dared to try them and asked for a small sauce plate (like the one they had given me their mayo in) instead the bartender (I don't know if he was being lazy or not but decided a GLASS ..yes a drinking glass...(as seen in pic) ) would be suitable to hold the sauces he just gave and dip my fish and chips in??! Was I really supposed to fork dip and dig for my food in a glass? I barely ate Lmao I finished my beer and headed elsewhere for my next one."}
{"text":"The food sampled at this establishment was nothing special.  The emphasis here, as mentioned in the name, is beer.  They have a large beer menu and on this busy Tuesday night we did not sample from it.  It's loud so expect to shout over other patrons when attempting to order, converse or get the cheque!  Good bar food.  Large drink menu.  Worth a visit if you're into beer and watching the Blue Jays!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location of Bar Hop a few times, and it's a nice place to chill and hang out with my friends for a few beers. They have a great selection of craft beers, including ciders and actually some pretty awesome cocktails. The food is okay. I've tried the mussels, which were decent (not the best) and were served with some baguette. My hugest complaint is that it is uncomfortable hot inside during the summer. I'm not sure if it is just me, but this is especially the case on the middle level (closer to the roof top patio). The service is normally decent, but not the friendliest."}
{"text":"The beer here is so so. The service is terrible though!! The bartender was snooty as hell and after my beer was served I didn't see her again until I had to hunt her down for tab. I won't return."}
{"text":"Consisting of a bar floor and outside/rooftop patio, this place had a great buzz when my friends and I went in. On a Saturday night they were gracious enough to allow our party of 8 to take over a corner of the restaurant. I had the pork sausage with their in-house pickled veggies as an appetizer. The veggies are amazing. If you have a liking for sour with a kick of spice, these were great! With jalapeños, cauliflower, carrots, bell peppers and an assortment of other veg, it was refreshing as the veg was crisp and flavourful. The pork sausage on a bun was very savoury. Mixed with sourkrout and grilled peppers, it was an excellent meal. The biggest surprise was the in-house made kettle chips that complimented the meal. They were fresh and crisp and very tasty without the need of added salt. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This place is A-OK. Definitely smaller than the more well-known Barhop on King. Reading the menus were like trying to interpret ancient hieroglyphics - beers page was at some obscure semi-back page; not convenient at all. Agreed with Ian's review about the $80 steak for a nonspecialty place. In fact, I've been here twice and have seen maybe 1 or 2 people out of the whole restaurant eating. All in all, it's a modern pub with a wide selection of beer. The location is OK and will be a competitor for the Black Bull (unless it's patio season). It's a good place to watch the Jays Games, but you'd have to sit at the front as there are no TVs at the back. Only recommend this for a quick pint, not any longer."}
{"text":"Cool place to chill! Went here on a Monday evening with some friends & the rooftop patio was great. It's a first come first serve basis by the way. To order drinks you would have to secure a place on the patio first then go downstairs to the bar to buy it which was a downside but other than that my friends and I had a great time just chillin on the rooftop"}
{"text":"This review might be a little bias. I love drinking beers but I never enjoy pub food. You can call your pub Gastropubs or whatever. I am not going to eat at pub unless I am so drunk and need to eat.  So this review has nothing to do with what food Barhop serves. All I care about is the BEER!  The choice here is identical to the original location. Impressive tap list on rotation from indie breweries.  Staff is knowledgeable and speaks Beer!  I love the deco here. Not as crowded and I am eyeing the roof top patio! All these potential! Just waiting for the summer.....  I think I will be coming to this location a little more often just to drink their beers!  Cheers!!"}
{"text":"The beer is awesome and has tons of selection. The food is okay. Not amazing. Not bad."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for work lunches since this place is in a convenient location. If it wasn't for their location and group seating capacity, I would never come back here.   I came with a group of 10 for lunch on a weekday, and it wasn't busy. There might have been 8 other people in the entire restaurant. We were seated on the patio, which was nice and sunny! Off to a good start.   Then my experience goes downhill. The server took our drink orders first, and didn't come back to get our food orders 30 min into our seating. 1 hour after we arrived, the server tells me they are out of the item I ordered. I changed my order to the Arugula & Fig salad, without the cheese (I'm lactose intolerant). I waited 25 min for this salad, and at this point, I've been here for almost 1.5 hrs without any food. I think this was the longest I've EVER waited for a lunch. I had to get it to-go because I needed to get back to work.   Not to mention, the salad itself was really not worth $14. It was just arugula, walnuts, maybe 1 fig sliced up, and a vinaigrette. Even if I could eat the cheese, it would have been disappointing."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere after Sunday afternoon Jays game. Quick helpful service. Friendly patrons."}
{"text":"Great craft beer selection by the glass or pick any 4 for a colourful flight.  Local and European varieties. Casual atmosphere with a beautiful rooftop patio."}
