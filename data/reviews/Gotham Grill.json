{"text":"I'm pretty health conscious, so I really enjoyed the hormone free burger. The burger was cooked perfectly and not greasy at all. Good job guys."}
{"text":"If I could give it a zero I would... Fries got the poutine were undercooked and covered in salt (the gravy is supposed to add the salt), the cheese was just pre shredded mozerella and the burger was just a plain pre cooked burger... Both those items cost us $24. Save your money, it's not even worth $10 for both."}
{"text":"We ate here this afternoon while we were at trinity bellwoods..we had two burgers with one poutine and a drink ...26$ ... a bit over priced  . Poutine was amazing.  My burger wasn't anything special.  A bit dry honestly.. next time we'll just get one poutine and share or go to a actual restaurant where it's probably cheaper."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to see a veggie burger on the menu... until I tasted it. They really couldn't have invested less energy or attention into this thing. The paddy was pretty mushy and way too salty and the bun was a pathetic little scrap of smashed white bread. Felt like a begrudging plant-ish addition to a meat-centric menu, intentionally made to taste like low quality fast food burgers. Thank goodness for the banana peppers, sauces, veggies and pickles in the condiment bar. (Neglected as that was.) If that's what $10 gets you in Gotham, it's also why I won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"Great burgers!! Mediocre poutine, but burgers were amazing!! Service was excellent under stressful situation!! Keep it up guys:)"}
{"text":"The gotham grill burger tasted like yummy real meat... i would order it with their special poutine next time again  The cashier was very helpful as well"}
{"text":"I feel like Batman when I order from here. Just make sure your pockets are steep like Bruce Wayne's as it is pricey for a food truck.   FYI - The Gotham Burger is pretty good."}
{"text":"I had their Gotham poutine at the foot truck fest at woodbine and when I say delicious! The fries were made perfect, the contrast of the sour cream and bacon was a deadly combination. And I don't know what type of bacon they used but the flavour was amazing! I was pretty impressed and so was my belly! Paid 9 bucks for a small food container size or their regular. That was a little steep in my opinion but alas, the taste made up for it. Only complaint was that the bacon was too little. But it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Over Priced and disappointing!  Ordered Grilled Chicken Burger Combo and just Jumbo Hot Dog  total whopping cost $21.00.   Received my Chicken burger to look at it and wonder where the rest of the chicken was; portion didn't even cover the bun.   The amount of fries received was also pitiful.  Will never be a customer of there's again!  Don't be deceived by the appealing look of this truck just keep moving."}
