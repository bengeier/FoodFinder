{"text":"Our first time in, and we'll be back for sure.  If you buy wine on a regular basis you kinda know what the retail prices are for many wines.  You also know that many restaurants will charge you 3 times retail for a bottle.  Not this place. They seemingly are only charging twice retail.  I appreciate this business model because I don't mind paying more, I just don't like to get gouged.  So, 5 stars for the price of the wine.

We did the charcuterie board, and it was a deal for $16 (Happy Hour pricing).  We've been charged more for less at other places. Again, 5 stars.

Ambience was laid back, but excellent furnishings and decor.  Service was impeccable.  We will return."}
{"text":"Had the empanadas, they were awesome!  Great wine selection.  Very friendly staff.  I will be back many times.  Very nice furniture and ambiance.  Very nice addition to this part of town."}
{"text":"My husband and I were very excited to try this new (to us) restaurant with music.  We arrived at 6:45PM on a Friday evening and the wait for dinner was set at 35 minutes.  We were offered a seat at the sofas which was fine.  Observation...We commented as we sat at the sofas waiting for a waiter/waitress to attend to us that it was odd to have 3 hostesses standing around while we waited for service from the wait staff.  After a bit of time....too long, our waitress asked us for a drink order.  We were still hopeful of an outstanding outcome.  Minutes later, the hostesses unexpectedly directed us to a table.  It should be noted that it was not extremely busy.

Shortly thereafter we ordered our meal.  I ordered the Shrimp and my husband ordered the sea bass.  Dinner arrived very quickly and after one bite, I asked the waitress to return my meal.  The shrimp was quite possibly the chewiest, and the most poorly executed shrimp I have had in a while.  Our waitress suggested the daily special, tuna.  I immediately agreed but asked that it be prepared medium to medium well.  I do not enjoy rare tuna.

We ordered a second round of drinks and while my husband completed his meal, i waited for my replacement meal.  It never came and a different waiter came to clear my husband's dishes away and asked if we wanted dessert.  Where was our waitress?

We explained our circumstance and asked him to fetch our waitress.  Shortly thereafter, the night manager arrived.  I explained my frustration at not receiving my replacement meal, which to any professional would have been understood and supported. However, she did not.  She immediately displayed an attitude, harshly repeating that i ordered my tuna well cooked and it takes awhile.  I explained to her that it should never take any more than 10-15 minutes to replace.  She said they had other customers that took priority over my replacement order.  She also stated that is was her job to tell us how their business is conducted.

My husband was shocked!  He asked her to stop telling us how we should feel.  She responded by telling him that she will not listen to someone being disrespectful to her.  What????  I asked by husband to let me handle it.  I again clearly explained without emotion how disappointed i was and that I no longer was willing to wait for the replacement meal and asked her for a check.  After a few minutes, she returned explaining to me that we would not be charged for my returned shrimp dinner or the tuna but she had it boxed up to send with me.  Again, inappropriate!  Of course, I would not pay for either meal that I did not receive and or accept.   I would never eat the boxed meal she left me given the animosity shown!  We asked for the main manager's contact information.

Finally, the owner came over and we explained our extreme dissatisfaction at our treatment.  After a lively, but very friendly and professional exchange, she asked us what we wanted.  We responded, nothing but good service and a good attitude!   It should be no surprise we did not want a free meal, we did not want special considerations, we simply wanted a good meal and good service and respectful treatment from her painfully inept manager.  The owner was extremely professional, but, our experience was already ruined and we just wanted to leave.  She left us with her card and asked us to give them another chance....it will be hard to forget the extremely poor service from her chosen management team.  I can't imagine dealing with her very rude manager again!  

Time will tell if we choose to attempt this experience again....good service is a prerequisite in this highly competitive restaurant world.  Gilbert downtown is a hopping and successful dinner environment and a drive south should be worth it!   This was not!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the vibe and environment Wild Vine presents. We arrived on a Saturday night to see a packed restaurant with mellow live music playing. What a transformation from the prior establishments that used to occupy this space.

We ordered the Napa Salad and tostadas. That salad was amazing and fresh. The tostadas were full of flavor and appropriate sized for an appetizer. 

I really like the wine list, Cakebread, Hess and Sequoia Grove for example. Impressed to see some really good wines. I can't wait to taste them all.

Overall a great quaint place with a mellow vibe perfect for wine and food. I generally don't compare restaurants but compared to other wine bars, I'd say Wild Vine definitely holds its own."}
{"text":"Love the service and that fact that there is not a bad seat in the house. The selection of food was beautiful and perfectly executed. Dine for a nice dinner out or enjoy an app and bottle of wine casually with some friends, either way you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Overwhelmed by the strong odor of dirty grease traps as i entered the establishment. Had a drink at the bar, decided that was enough. Pompous staff and smelly atmosphere is not a recipe for success. I wouldn't go back there if you paid me."}
{"text":"Unimpressed with this over priced wine bar. Service was slow, prices were way too high for amount and quality.  Won't be going back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment twice. I would give it 5 stars but I am docking one star for the sake of my tushie on my last visit. The first time I went it was a girls night out. They made a very nice Washington apple martini. I ordered the cheese board and the beef sliders. It was all beautiful and very delicoous. Service was wonderful! I could not wait to go back again. I was craving those sliders. I popped in again on a whim. I ordered a sprite, buffalo cheese and tomatoes and the mouth watering sliders. Service was great again. Food came out I took a few bites of my sliders. I looked at my slider realizing the center was squishy and raw. As lady like as I could spit out what I had not eaten. I then realized too late I did not ask for it to be cooked well done. Possibly the cook was overwhelmed with the crowd. I am just speculating as to my squishy center. Early that morning the cow bit me back. About 5 times I'd say. If I had not had such wonderful experience prior I would have said forget this place. It was an unfortunate early morning for my tummy and tushy I did not know it was humanly possible to potty that much? I think they put a lot of love into this place. Enjoy it. You will probably love it but if you are a delicate flower like me ASK FOR YOUR BEEF WELL DONE unless you like prayers in the potty."}
{"text":"Food here is very good, as is the service. The bruschettas are all amazing, and even my 5 year old daughter loves the shrimp appetizer. Chicken tostadas are very good as well. The only thing I've had here that I didn't absolutely love were there empanadas - too small and chewy for me, although the sauces that were served with them were very tasty."}
{"text":"First timers and we will be back.  We ordered pretzels and salad to split since not to hungry.  Came out already split.  Staff was excellent and noticed what we assume is the manager quietly watching over. All the staff seemed very attentive, polite and  professional.  Atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing.  Choose a table, chairs, traditional table or sit at the bar.  It's very social.  Lots of laughter could be heard. We WILL DEFINITELY be back"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, enjoyed the meal so much - bartender Darin treated us s well. Great customer service, will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Great find in our neighborhood, love this lil gem! Great food, nice wines and friendly staff. This will definitely be our go to spot."}
{"text":"Simply stated. This is the best restaurant in Chandler. 

And I've been in the food service/restaurant business for over 20 years. 

Chandlers best keep secret."}
{"text":"Luv the vibe/atmosphere. Drinks and food are overpriced for the area. This is not Las Vegas!  I will have to say I've had better drinks at top rated restaurants in Las Vegas for less money than this place. I actually met the owner and she is very nice. There is a disconnect here and I hope they understand and correct. We need a place like this here in SE Chandler."}
{"text":"I don't usually take the time to write reviews even though I use Yelp all the time to guide me to great places. I'm taking the time now because I was so impressed with the great changes at this place.

They have a new chef that has made this my new go to place. The flavor profiles she brings to her dishes are fantastic. As I sit here writing this review, I think I will have to go back again tonight. Great cocktails as well, they made me a blueberry margarita that I wasn't sure I would love. It was so good, I had to have two more. 
 
The décor and vibe were always spot on. Now the food and cocktails reach that level. I am impressed by an owner that strives to improve the drinking and dining experience for her customers."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night (ladies night) with a small group of friends (7). Food was good but lacked service. Upon first arriving we received great attention and service, but once two more tables were seated we hardly got service and had to ask for drinks and flag someone else down to order. We would have had more to drink but didn't want to wait 10-15 minutes for a drink each time. There were only 5 tables total inside and out. We all left a little bummed because we were all hopeful this place would be a hit. It's been several months since I went so maybe I'll give it another try with a smaller party."}
{"text":"Great staff, nice wine list, very tasty food.  So happy to have a nice little local spot like this in our neighborhood.  I'm a big empanada fan, and they have daily empanada specials... how cool is that!"}
{"text":"This place has a great ambiance, and fantastic live music.  The food I'm struggling with.  The bruschetta is on the smaller side and I'm not loving the flavors.  I've tried several of the apps and it's nothing I would order again.  The hummus has a different texture and flavor and I'd prefer it with cucumbers over raw zucchini.  The wine is great and so was the pumpkin dessert I tried.  I've decided I love it for a drink but not interested in the food."}
{"text":"The hubs and I were feeling kind of bored with our usual places, but didn't want to drive too far for a quick happy hour on a holiday weekend night. I was happy to find this place! We had wine, guacamole, calamari, and the butcher block. All were delicious, but what I enjoyed most was the music. The normal stereo music was quite fun and pleasant and the live music was excellent. I loved that the music was at a level where you could still have a normal conversation without yelling. Overall it was a very relaxed atmosphere with good food and drink. It's not the cheapest in town, but I'll be back."}
{"text":"Not a wonderful first visit, seemed like a restaurant still trying to work the kinks out, service was slow, food was cold, waiter was hard to track down.  Once the food was reheated it was very good, but most likely won't return"}
{"text":"We are not a food/restaurant critics - just a patrons

What can we say? For starters, we just spent three fantastic days in Chandler, AZ. Of those three days, we dined at \"The Wild Vine\" every night. Why you ask? Well, because everything is phenomenal:

* For starters, there is an incredible assortment of extremely fine wines in all dollar ranges;
* There is Live music EVERY night performed by very talented local artist playing everything from Jazz, Blues and classic rock with newer songs thrown in for good measure (artist included Ian Eric (ianeric DOT com) and Ethan);
* The \"Top Chef\" level kitchen managed by Chef Joey and his crew concocted daily special soups, appetizers and entrees (we enjoyed the Duck Burgers, Bison empanadas, Garlic Roasted Colossal Shrimp and, of course, all of the desserts - we had them all);
* The very attentive bar (especially Mike and Irish) and;
* The wait staff, particularly Melanie, Sarah and the rest of the crew.

The décor is very elegant, but comfortable, with formal or casual dining, intimate service while relaxing in over-stuff couches and easy chairs.

Bottom-line - It is a must go place for formal or casual dinner, engagements (I'd make reservations), celebrations or just a place to chill with your favorite glass of wine, enjoy fantastic food and listen to great music."}
{"text":"This is a great place close to home.  We went last night and it was a packed house. We will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"We came again tonight to try out the official rollout of the new menu, wow did they deliver. Tiffany is our favorite waitress here, who recommended a new wine, and we love it. Also, Chadwick is our favorite busboy because he is attentive, genial, and quite easy on the eyes! I can't say enough good things about the New menu. Tonight, we had the fried artichoke hearts along with the chicken lettuce wraps, warm olives, and their new bruschetta.  We have tried several wine bars in the last few months, and this is, without question, our favorite new  wine bar and a great place for dinner. If you love tapas, you're gonna love this."}
{"text":"The empanadas were tasty and our server was attentive, but the rest of our experience was terrible. The first glass of pinot grigio my wife was served tasted like vinegar so we sent it back. My steak was tough and tasteless. My wife ordered the sea bass and was presented with a plate that was mostly risotto. $100 for a mediocre meal. Needless to say, we won't go back."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday night and it wasn't busy at all. The live music was good, and the food was better. We started with the empanadas and sliders, and had the Sea Bass and Ribeye for our entrees. The Sea Bass was perfectly cooked and served with a delicious risotto. The ribeye came with a wonderful butter on top and roasted vegetables. We tried all three of the desserts (we were joined by two friends, so they helped us eat them). The cheesecake and creme brûlée were great, but the chocolate bliss was too rich and we could only have a couple bites. For chocolate lovers, the bliss would have been perfect. Next time, we are in town, we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Expensive without happy hour.  Cost me $98 including tip for 3 glasses of wine, caesar salad, small chicken breast (with 37 garlic cloves/ 7 micro slices of carrot / 3 potato-lings) and a tapas portion of chicken tostadas appetizer.  I guess the food was ok but I can't justify those prices. Zero value for me.  The place has a nice atmosphere, clean, and comfy."}
{"text":"We have been here 3-4 times. It is a good atmosphere. However, the bartending service leaves a lot to be desired. We watched him hang outside with a \"buddy\" for 15-20 minutes. He came in and hung out at the end of the bar, all the while we waited a good 25+ minutes to be served again. I was close to asking the owner for our bill since the bartender seemed too busy with his pal or on his phone. Either way, I don't care. There are plenty of options in Chandler. Start with Tony Saccos a few doors down. They actually provide great service."}
{"text":"Fabulous food! The sliders and lollipop lamp chops are to die for. Great wine choice and a cute place to enjoy some wine with friends. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed! Went for the first time tonight and the hostess was snooty. She didn't go out of her way to welcome us or assist when we asked if there was any room at the bar. We were treated poorly, left and will NOT be back."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a wine guy, I'd rather have a beer, that being said, this place is great. Service is fast and attentive. Bartenders are friendly and funny and very busy.

The few selections I have tried on the menu are very good. The mozzarella and tomatoes starter is excellent. The balsamic reduction is done very well. I think perhaps a dusting of cracked black pepper in the kitchen might help just a bit and perhaps a slice of soft bread to get all that goodness off the plate.

I love the tapas. I'm used to a larger slice of bread as opposed to a thinner more brittle baguette type bread. If the owners and managers monitor this please consider shifting away from the thin bread to perhaps a peasant loaf with more surface area. The crispier bread disallows for taking a single bite as it shatters. That being said, the combinations are fantastic. 

This is my new go to place. You guys have done a wonderful job and people are going to love it. I will see you all again two times like I do every week."}
{"text":"Great, cozy wine bar.  This is exactly what this neighborhood has needed for sometime.  Glad I finally found this place.  Definitely will be back, and often!"}
{"text":"Great wine selection and delicious food, nice atmosphere and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"We have eaten at the Wild Vine 3-4 times with no issues, enjoying the food each time. However, two separate Saturdays in the past 3 months we have been turned away from an empty restaurant due to not having reservations. Both times we walked in between 5:45-6:00p to double digit open tables, but were told the tables are reserved for live music...but the live music does not start until 8p. Business must be excellent to turn away customers who can eat, drink, pay, and leave prior to the live music starting. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food, found a great wine I had enjoyed before, Freakshow, by the bottle or glass. Good attention from server. Great 1st experience!"}
{"text":"Food is good, wait staff is good & friendly. Bar tenders are great. A bit pricey though. Hostess staff is young and could be trained better. The overall look and feel of the restaurant is pretty cool."}
{"text":"We walked in and said \"finally a good place like a restaurant you would find in Scottsdale but now in Chandler\"
Bartender was not very friendly!
Wine selection was awesome!
Food was really good!
Owner was there and never approached us
With a new restaurant the owners should talk to the customers to hear the good and bad.
Will we go back?....yes..........but hopefully with a friendlier bartender!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place for the first time tonight. After reading the reviews, we felt this was a place for a date night on Saturday. 

We walked in and the atmosphere was great. The decor was beautiful and Mike was our waiter. 

The service was A+ and the food was incredible. 

We tried the bread and garlic appetizer and the empanadas. Delicious. We then had the sea bass and bone in rib eye. Wow. 

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Wow. This is really a neat place. We loved the atmosphere. They offer a very interesting menu. Service was great. Tiffany was our server. She could describe every dish so thoroughly, you would have thought she was preparing it herself. I love prime rib, so I chose that. It was the best prime rib I have ever had. Everyone at our table was impressed with their food. The portions are not skimpy, either. The live music was great and it is pretty obvious in watching them perform that they are very talented. Very CLASSY place! We will be back."}
{"text":"Let me first say how excited I've been for a wine bar to open closer to us here in S. Chandler. After all so many of us spend our money elsewhere looking for great places with great food and great drinks. So my husband and I tried it and loved the wine list, loved the decor, loved our entree of Chilean sea bass and risotto. Two downsides-we are used to the larger proportions and style of bruschetta at nearby wine bars & just overall lower price points on entrees. We felt the bruschetta was priced too high @ 3 for $11. Area wine bars grill large pieces of baguette or ciabatta bread and top them and cut in 3-4 pieces then give you four across the platter for $13-$15). The bread is usually chewy not crunchy. Having said that, I really feel there is always room for improvement and hope this place continues and thrives. 
I do plan to go again & try their happy hour menu sometime."}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday last month. This place is super cute! Food was good, wine was even better, server kept things fun all night. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but the menu is always the same and mediocre. Need to change things up to keep people coming through the door."}
{"text":"Butcher block starter was delicious.  Wife and I opted to share a few small plates. Got the sliders and tostadas....both great!  Also got the chocolate desert....very rich but good.

Cool atmosphere, good service.  

Will be back."}
{"text":"This was such a cute little place. We went on a Friday night and caught some of the live music which was a delight. Food was great! We tried the bruschetta, the sliders and a bottle of wine. The vibe and decor with lounge couches really reminded me of Vintage 95 in Downtown Chandler. 

It was a nice date night! We will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, incredibly friendly service. You feel like you're at home here-except better because it's so much fancier than home! (At least fancier than my home). The decorations are gorgeous-literally from the floor to the ceiling. Leather couches everywhere, and beautiful cloth clutches. And of course leather chairs! The lighting is insane! Just gorgeous and classy. If you haven't been here you are missing out!"}
{"text":"We love the warm atmosphere ... the sofas are a nice touch. The bruschetta is spot on!"}
{"text":"The service was good, empanadas were tasty and the chicken tostadas were yummy, but the Butcher's Block was straight from the deli counter and way overpriced for the quality. Great wine selection and reasonable prices bottles, good selection of brews on tap. Check it out, it's worth a one time visit."}
{"text":"Wonderful bruschetta. Loved wine flights. Great small plates menu. I personally don't like the decor of the restaurant ... I didn't feel comfortable there.  But I liked the food and service was great, so we'll be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Didn't sample much of the food but the wine was fantastic. Great service and the live music was awesome."}
{"text":"Had a really nice experience here on a Friday evening recently. Just my wife and I. We shared a few items from the small plate menu and bruschetta 3 ways with a cocktail. Service was attentive, it was quiet enough to talk without yelling. Would have liked a slightly larger table and a bit more light to read the menu. Food was wonderful. We will go back."}
{"text":"Exquisite beef & chorizo sliders, as well as amazing chicken tostadas. Happy hour drink menu could use more options but a decent selection of wines and beers. East valley wine bars are hard to come by, this one is definitely a gem."}
{"text":"My wine was crisp and delicate.  Tapas were wonderful.  A bit of live music was a welcome change from the sports TV.  The server was attentive and polite but passed tapas across the table and wine glasses rather than serving from the right, the only disappointment."}
{"text":"Kellie and Kim make for an incredible dining experience!!! Went out for a nice bottle of wine and dinner and had one of the best steaks in this area. Highly recommend skipping the fancy \"steakhouse\" restaurants and visit wild vine for the live music, drinks and food!!! A must visit!! Definitely FIVE STAR experience."}
{"text":"Note: The Go-To wine bar!!!

Live music: Awesome! 

Food: wide variety so rare among wine bars. Try the pasta! 

Drinks: very good. Wine might be a little high priced. 

Service: very well balanced. Not a bother, yet always there."}
{"text":"Great place went on a Friday night live music, great wine selection. Met a beautiful lady for drinks and this is the place to do that. The atmosphere the staff and even the customers all having a great time makes this place perfect for date night."}
{"text":"The place looks like it's trying a little too hard to be fancy but it is comfortable and all the patrons were dressed causal even on Mother's Day. My husband and I were hesitant about bringing our daughters to dinner with us but it wasn't an issue at all. They have high chairs, kids menu, crayons and even a book/scratch pad for the girls to play with. I was impressed. I had the lamb from the Mother's Day menu with asparagus and I had risotto subbed for the potatoes. It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. My husband had the prime rib and the girls had chicken skewers and Mac&cheese. We also had the pan de ajo for a starter. It was delicious! I want to go back to try the ribeye and the fish."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about going to a new restaurant in the same location where multiple bars and restaurants had failed but I think this place has a fighting chance.  The decor is nice and the bartender made a great old fashion. The food was also of good quality and tasted great. We had the bone in ribeye and I'm looking forward to going again.  The only downside was there was a smell to the restaurant that I think has been lingering since nozzle heads was there."}
{"text":"The food is bad. Overpriced. Place was empty on Friday night. If you see an empty restaurant on a Friday night, it's a bad sign. The slider tatsted like cat food. Cheese platter taste like cheese you can get at Walmart."}
{"text":"Couldn't tell ya how the food or drink is bc they left us sitting there for over 25 mins without so much as taking our drink order. We walked out ... it wasn't even busy and we were seated in a almost empty section."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise with this find! Our friends who live in Gilbert took us to this little spot for dinner. They have been there a few times before. Our server Tracy was very knowledgeable and came up with an array of several wine selections and recommendations regarding the appetizers and main courses. We had the shrimp skewers, lamb lollipops and crabcakes to start and they were very very good. For main courses my buddy and I had the steak which was exceptional given the fact that this is not really a steakhouse. It was tender and flavorful and cooked to perfection. Other main courses were the gnocchi and couscous. Both ere amazing!
Our wine was a California red 1444 and it was so good we had two bottles!
Desert was the cheesecake and chocolate lava cake, both were to die for! To compliment the evening there was live music that started at about 8:00 pm!
We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"A small little place, but the BEST bruschetta I've ever had in my life. They make the bread from scratch. The pizza is amazing too! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The ambience is great!  The first time my husband and I stopped was a Sunday about 4pm a couple weeks ago. My first two choices of wine they did not have and what bartender offered for me to try was nothing like I had picked...you should know wine in a wine bar.  I finally picked a glass I enjoyed and my husband had a glass of his favorite on the menu.  From there the service was very inattentive even though at best there were two other couples.  They were standing around chatting to each other. We ordered the guacamole (blah) and the tostadas (yummy) to share.  It took forever to get a second glass of wine and then the bartender said her shift was ending and asked us to cash out and then start a new tab with the other bartender...really? WE were not moving tables and we were planning on eating dinner at the bar which we had mentioned.  In a classy place, not a sports bar is common to close a tab and open a tab because of a shift change.  The restaurant needs to work that out for employees not the guests.  With the new bartender we ordered the pasta with chicken and said we were splitting it.  No offer to split it in kitchen, no offer to bring and extra plate..yup brought it out and placed it in front of me so my hubby and I could share the bowl.  Smh 
The pasta was tasty, nice mix of flavors.  We ordered one more glass to share and moved to a couch to listen to a little music.  The music fit the place and the acoustics were such you could hear him but still hold a conversation which was nice.  Overall good experience just need a more attentive, classy bartenders."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we had great service and great food. The atmosphere is very nice, everyone was friendly. We had the bruschetta and sliders and they were outstanding. We will be back"}
{"text":"Newer place in town, has luxury leather couches to whittle the day into evening. Very well priced upscale food. Not sure if it's the owner but, obviously a trained Chef.  Small portion cheese board like a Postino's available here though they offer actual cooking , gives us the Prime Rib on special tonight.  Really large bar, come enjoy"}
{"text":"Wow what a great little sophisticated yet welcoming place.  Our food was absolutely amazing and the service was as good.  It is a fun place to enjoy a five star meal.  I will continue to visit and enjoy"}
{"text":"Nice place, but someone lets hipster bartender play loud obscure hard rock. Not really wine bar music. Would not recommend if want to relax with friends and enjoy a conversation."}
{"text":"Prices are a little high for sub par food. Location and is nice. Great place just for a drink or a late night snack."}
{"text":"Craft beer lovers--don't steer away from this place just because it's a wine bar. They have a better craft beer selection than any bar/restaurant in the area.  In addition, the taps are $2 off at happy hour.  I came in for a few beers and the happy hour menu, both of which were amazing.  They have taps from Huss, SanTan, Four Peaks, Uncle Bears, and Prescott, to name a few.  I ordered the sliders to compliment the beers and they were fantastic!  In addition, the service was friendly and attentive.  Beer lovers who have wine-lover friends/partners won't be disappointed here!"}
{"text":"I ordered the swordfish, and it was great. But the risotto was not completely done. My husband ordered the steak and it was overpriced, grisely and not worth the $40 we paid for it. I ordered a second glass of wine & it never came. The Bloody Mary was weak and mostly tomato juice. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Good food and a really cute place. My only complaint is the seating options for a party of 2. Even with reservations asking to not be seated at a tiny table, it still happens. Your choices are either an awkward high top for 2 (no one likes a high top, no one) or a TINY table in the middle of the room, right next to another tiny table. This makes it feel like you're sitting at a table with 2 other strangers. Not very romantic."}
{"text":"Can't believe we haven't been here before. Close enough to be dangerous. Found by accident while looking for something close with good seafood & stumbled on this neighborhood joint. Glad we did. The wine list is superb. Girly had the tuna, I had the long ball me ribeye.  Both were excellent. The ceviche appetizer was a real treat. The cocktail selection provided the perfect ending to our wonderful meal. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This was our second time visiting on a Saturday night.  The firsts time we had no reservations and were seated right away.  The second time I made us reservations, just in case.  Both experiences, were so enjoyable.  The food as so flavorful and cooked to perfection.  Our waiter Tracy, was a complete delight.  Made excellent recommendations on food and wine.  The atmosphere is perfect for a date night or a fun celebration.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is our favorite neighborhood wine bar. For starters the bartender Irish makes this place. He is charming, classy and quick to make conversation. The atmosphere is wonderful and the food is excellent and always consistent. If you enjoy excellent food and great service with a neighborhood feel, this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with their bruschetta and slider trio! It can be a little pricey so happy hour is definitely the way to go at this place. Service is friendly and fun. They've had live music both times I've been there. It's got a cool couchy vibe. It's close to home so we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The waitress when I asked about GF options asked me if I knew what gluten was and was very condescending.  She told me that they were out of GF bread that is why I asked what else was GF.  I like the location and the food is food is good too.  Not impressed with our server."}
{"text":"So excited this place opened up!  What a great way to spend a couple of hours with friends.  I love the very descriptive wine menu. They also have a really great happy hour.  The vibe is so laid back and cozy yet chic. The only thing my friend and I tried were the bruschetta and a bottle of wine.  The flavor was so good but we didn't like the bread.  We both agreed that Postinos is the gold standard of Bruschetta so when it was served on very hard toast points we were bummed. The flavor was there but the bread was not. I will definitely try it and head there for dinner soon."}
{"text":"The sliders are the best I've ever had. Ever. OMG, three different flavor combinations, one chicken, one beef, and one pork. All with different and unique flavors. Not to mention an impressive assortment of fine wines."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying our waitress was wonderful and the only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one! Unfortunately the food was terrible! I ordered a $14 beet salad and they were out of goat cheese and it was a bunch of mixed greens with canned beets on the side. Instead of the crumbled goat cheese that comes on the salad they subbed a goat cheese spread they put on bruschetta...not exactly a good combo on a salad. My husbands pasta was subpar at best and the chicken tasted like it wasn't cooked all the way. I'm sad My husband and I didn't enjoy this place this time, because we have been there in the past and it was awesome. We paid over $100 for a meal that we could have made at home for $20. We live only two miles from the restaurant, but will never go back again."}
{"text":"Very fun place. The waiter was fun and accommodating. The appetizers were great. Stayed for the music. Fun night with the girls."}
{"text":"Pleasant ambience and beautiful decor but the experience is severely lacking. Sadly, the Owner  and the staff's ability to create an elite atmosphere, leaves one feeling uncomfortable and awkward. A bit clumsy, a bit too focused on gouging patrons for a dollar here and a dollar there. 

Waiter came to our table at one point then bent down to tie his shoe! The wait staff was kind and very attentive but overall from the owner/manager down it was just lacking polish. 

Sending email marketing blasts (multiple times) but not being familiar with the content four days after the first sent date. Had to show them 'their' emails and then they did us a 'favor' by honoring 'part of the ad' but not all. Worst part - owner came to our table to make excuses... Top venues know how to say I am sorry, honor their marketing blasts, and take a $1 loss due to their written communication shortcomings. Way too expensive for the quality of the clunky experience."}
{"text":"Drinks were good. Ordered the margarita pizza and it was soupy sent it back and asked not to get another one. It was so soupy the crust was soggy and the topping fell of like water. Order the burger with mushrooms and the burger came out without mushrooms.  Very pricey. Take time to monitor the food. First time there and won't be going back. Staying with stone and vine"}
{"text":"Intimate, high end atmosphere and friendly, attentive service.  I think this is my new favorite date night destination.  Loved the food (special requests are taken in stride)!  The options for light bites or regular entree for those with a larger appetite are all enticing.  I had a burger that I fancied up a bit with some of the premium add-ones and my husband ordered the pasta.  Both are prepared very well and I recommend either.  We will return regularly, great place, great job."}
{"text":"We've been here many times before on the weekends so we tried it out on a Wednesday evening. What a treat... cool vibe, great service (Andrea) and Duane Moore was fantastic on the guitar.

Ordered The Sonoma, Artisan Board and Shrimp Skewers with a couple of glasses of Malbec.

Perfect evening, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've never been treated so horribly at a restaurant before.  I ordered the bone-in ribeye per the server's recommendations, and they were allegedly \"out\" of the small one, so I ordered the big one - 16 oz ($44).  When it came to the table, it was about half the size of the ones ordered at the table next to us.  I questioned the size, and the server insisted it was the 16-oz.  (I've ordered and cooked a lot of 16-oz. steaks in my life, and this was nowhere close to 16 oz.)  However, I took it at face value and began eating.  About 3 bites in, I noticed that the underside of the steak was completed uncooked - charred on top, raw on the bottom.  I showed the server, who apologized and simply took it back and said he would remove it from the bill as I didn't want anything else.

When the bill came, the server said that his manager only allowed him to take $15 off the $44 steak, and insisted that I not tip him to make up the difference.  I told him that was the wrong thing to do and asked that he bring out the manager.  Kelly, the manager, came to our table about 10 minutes later, and I told her that $15 off a $44 steak that was completely uncooked, and therefore inedible, was totally unacceptable.  Kelly proceeded to be very standoffish and argue with me that because I \"ate\" some of the steak that I would have to pay for some of it.  I responded that I stopped eating as soon as I realized there was an issue with my steak, but she insisted I was taking advantage of the meal, which is totally out of line and unacceptable.  She offered to \"take a little more off\", but I told her that the meal was unacceptable and that she as the manager should take responsibility for it and make it right.  She stared me down with a glare, and I told her that the only thing that I would accept is the steak back so I could cook it at home (which she deemed impossible because it was in the trash), or remove it completely from the bill.  After glaring at me for several seconds, she finally said she \"would take it off this one time\".

To have this sort of negative interaction with the manager of a restaurant is beyond my comprehension.  It was clear to me that she does not stand by the quality of their food or care to ensure the fair satisfaction of its customers.  I will not be returning, and I've shared this event with my family and friends, who will also not be coming to the Wild Vine Uncorked."}
{"text":"Great place close to home. The service, staff, food and drinks are all excellent. Good for a date night, dinner or just hanging out!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a small intimate restaurant that is also casual this is your place. The decor is very classic with a lot twood and leather. The bar is somewhat elegant and very comfortable seating. The bar staff is outstanding and if you're there talk to Irish who is one of the bartenders. Irish is one of the better bartenders I have ever met. The restaurant itself is dimly lit which adds to the ambience. There are some leather couches Highback leather chairs and sitting areas which will allow you to sit enjoy some wine or whatever drink and enjoy the environment. Establishment is located in a strip mall but that does not take away from the intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been here for happy hour and after hours drinks.  Delicious food, shrimp skewers, bruschetta etc. Good wine and beer choices."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot! The food is fantastic. They have a great wine selection and the ambiance is upscale, but comfortable with nailhead leather furniture and comfy couches. I highly recommend stopping in. It's so nice to have this in our neck of the woods. We will be back!"}
{"text":"They have pretty decent drinks...I will say that. BUT..The wine selection is OK. Food was OK, nothing to write home about. Avoid the calamari....not good. My biggest gripes about this place are price...it is expensive for what you get, and it is really nothing special, and every time we go in there it has a smell.....a sewage smell. It really is distracting and doesn't leave one wanting to go back. We have gone twice, I figure I would give them a fair shake since it is right down the street, but two strikes and its out.  Other places close by are far better."}
{"text":"excellent location very close to our home the only drawback was the bruschetta was not perfect but the butcher board was fantastic. The location = great the prices were decent. overall this place is only going to get better. I'm very excited that this place has opened near our home."}
{"text":"The lamb chops were excellent. However, the bar service was not good. Their cocktails were poorly made."}
{"text":"Walked in, stunning.  Cushy couches and highback leather chairs.  There is two patios, one with a water feature and the other has a fireplace.  Service was ok. 
We sat outside.  I has the roasted pepper soup, I will take another.  Also the app of tomatoes and moz cheese, very good.  My husband had the pasta dish, he said he would order that again.  Price are on the high side but the food and atmosphere were very good."}
{"text":"We tried the wild vine uncorked a few days after it opened and all in all I am pretty happy to have something different and a little nicer. I was happy with the wine selection, but I would love to see a little more variation on liquor. That being said i believe with how nice everyone is it can only improve which will make this a 5 star place. I will agree with the previous poster about portion size versus price, but the fact that they are adjusting speaks volumes"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for to grab some appetizers and relax for a drink. The seating offers couches and tables and is very lounge feeling. We had a girls night here and enjoyed our experience. They had live music at night along with patio seating. Good spot for a neighborhood hang out."}
{"text":"I have not had a better sea bass dish anywhere. The wine selection is amazing. I love Sauvignon Blanc and they have some of the best I have ever tasted. The owner, Kim and her manager Kelli are super kind and have made this place an east valley gem."}
{"text":"Cute, convenient, casual!!  Great hand crafted cocktails. Live music. Great ambiance!  Enjoyed food from eclectic menu"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight - food was great and the recommended wine was perfect! Looking forward to going again!"}
{"text":"my 1st time there, great ambiance...great spot for date night or GNO...live music was a plus! everything we had was bomb...a lil bummed they were out of chocolate bliss but the creme brûlée was a phenom! 
didnt look at the happy hour menu much,  but hope to make this the new spot for our monthly wine night!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere...live music, but we could still hear each other so that was great. Good service, decent drink menu, and mediocre food. 

Patio tables are definitely too wobbly for wine glasses. A house wine is $8, a little steep for Gilbert/Chandler. Even Postinos & Living Room have a house, though not on the menu. We will probably give it another try."}
{"text":"I really like the food here. The service seems to be hit and miss. I don't like how small the two people tables are and how close in proximity they were set up. One of the times I went, they did run out of white wines. We had the ribeye and appetizers both times and enjoyed them. The ribeyes could use an additional sauce or butter of some sort. The butter they use got absorbed and was still kind of plain."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a restaurant and so close to us here in Seville.  They have live music, great food and wine and the staff is friendly and like family.  The environment is a bit upscale but artsy and comfortable.

You won't be disappointed - I always jump at the chance to eat here!"}
{"text":"This place is close to our house and offered on Southwest Dining points so it was a win/win for us to try it. 

We went on a Sunday night around 6pm and there was mellow live music, he was amazing. 

The food was delicious as well. We had happy hour specials galore which included $5 wines by the glass. There was a Malbec on happy hour which never happens and made me very happy. 

We had a cheese plate, sliders, tostadas, empanadas and I had potato leek soup. (Yes, there were only 2 of us). Everything was wonderful and brought out in a timely manner. The waitress even made sure to get in another drink order before happy hour was over. 

The place wasn't too crowded, since it was a school night. We will be going back, quite enjoyable."}
{"text":"We came here on Valentines day.  There was a fixed menu, but what we had was very good.  I am happy to have a nice little place like this nearby.  The only downfall was the service, I feel like they were a bit overwhelmed...which I understand since it was a busy holiday and they were running on very tight seating schedule."}
{"text":"Went with a group of people.  A wine bar with no wine!!  There's at least 4 wines on their menu that we tried to order that they didn't have.  All the \"unavailable\" ones were their most reasonably priced (which is still overpriced!).  

Ordered food as well. If you order a salad for dinner entree, you definitely need to add chicken or shrimp, or you will leave hungry as it is a little small. The salad dressing?  Nice that they provide it on the side, but the little container was barely half full.  Salad was dry.

No music, so not sure why the overpriced menu...."}
{"text":"We gave this place another shot. And wow did they improve! Food is amazing, live music, and our waiter, Joshua was very attentive, polite, and professional. Another guy, 16 year old Paul was very good too. He was making sure our glasses full with water, and took away empty dish plates. Give those guys a raise!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here since it opened. The restaurant has gone through some ups and downs and some changes. We had one of the best burgers ever tonight. The Chef was happy to chat with us and talk about the new menu. Give it another chance. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great food, atmosphere and service.  It is classy, hip and just what we needed in this area of Chandler.  I've been several times and am very impressed.  I actually went twice in one week.  

Wonderful atmosphere, live music and a perfect place to meet friends.  We really needed a classy place to fill the space and The Wild Vine is superb!  Bravo!"}
{"text":"This place was good in many ways and I will go back. The location is perfect as the options in SE Chandler are lacking. The decor was warm, rustic but upscale - yet you didn't have to dress up, but you could and look fine. Our server was very nice and was great at suggestions and to make the most out of happy hour. Happy hour made our girls night really reasonable. 2 bottles of wine, 2 plates of bruschetta, tomato and mozzarella, guava & chips and the cheese board for $90. The only thing that could be improved was the food. It was good - don't get me wrong, but it could have been a bit better. The guacamole tasted store bought but I liked everything else. Looking forward to trying more."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently spent our date night at The Wild Vine Uncorked and we're very happy with our choice. The waitstaff was super friendly with great humor. Our food and drinks were spot on. The live entertainment was the icing on the cake. We will definitely be hearing back on future date nights."}
{"text":"So excited to have this new bar so close to my \"hood\".  There aren't a ton of options in this part of the valley so when The Wild Vine opened, we were super excited to welcome it.

The atmosphere is very comfortable and inviting.  There are comfortable seating areas with leather chairs and sofas.  The customers are mostly people that are from this area and was pleasantly surprised to see some friendly faces I knew.  Think \"Cheers\" but nicer.  There is often live music which adds a nice touch.  The patio is nice as well.

The menu has some nice offerings but we did not have a chance to sample anything on this night.   I do look forward to going back to try some items.  The beer and wine offerings were nice.  I can't wait to go back and try some more!"}
{"text":"Best place I have been in the southeast valley. My wife and I went for a date night on a Saturday and were very impressed. Service was great and they were accommodating. Apps, drinks and dinner was great. I had the ribeye and thought it was better than the steak I had at Maestros a month prior, plus it was half the price. Both my wife and I were impressed. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but the happy hour specials are still pricier and the portions on the happy hour menu are super small. Irish behind the bar was great but the other bartenders weren't as personable or helpful"}
{"text":"Great food,  beautiful atmosphere, very reasonable prices.   Tonight Joe was playing the guitar and he is amazing!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here four times. The first time was for happy hour with a group of gals. At that time they served you bread as soon as you sat down..wonderful warm yummy bread and the appetizers were affordable. Beautiful venue. The second time we went to hh, no more free bread, had to pay and the prices for hh increased, but still a beautiful venue. So we returned for dueling pianos and even though busy, we had great service and dueling piano guys really involved the audience which made it a great and very funny show. Sad to say we returned for fourth time for dueling pianos and new piano players who were good but did nothing to draw in the crowd, even after two different people got up and sang on their own and were much better than the piano players! I ordered their \"we are famous for our pasta \" and no flavor and no bread included, no salad, no bread, just a plate of no taste pasta for $23!!!! When asked if I could please have some bread w my pasta (I remembered how good that first free sample of bread was!) I was told the owner refused to give you bread w pasta and there would be a charge. My first thought..don't tell on your owner and how about good customer service, making me want to come back? After all our table had several drinks and a bottle of wine! How much can a couple of pieces of bread be??? I was finally given two pieces of dry toasted bread, could have used as hockey pucks!! After complaining w our server.. he knew what good customer service was and gladly brought out bread to go w the pasta! Gosh, by that time, I had lost my appetite! And won't be back for dueling pianos unless the original guys return. Still a beautiful venue though."}
{"text":"I visited The Wild Vine Uncorked for the first time last night and was thoroughly impressed! You never know what to expect from a strip mall restaurant but the inside was elegant and comfortable. Clearly, every detail was considered with this build out. The service was friendly and prompt. Delicious drink and food options that will satisfy everyone. The beet salad was spot on and the Wine-O burger was one of the best I've had! Definitely visit this place-you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Review is for Happy Hour.
Service is great. We were well attended to the entire evening. Decent, well priced wines by the glass and the garlic & bread appetizer is to die for!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give 3 stars but two bad experiences have ruined this place for me.  The first time I visited - 3 days after opening, my husband and I sat at the bar for Happy Hour, had wine and a cheese board (both were excellent).  However, we were overcharged on the bill -- the happy hour discounts did NOT show up.  The manager took care of it and we left happy. Returned last evening with a group of four for happy hour on the patio.  I have to give the kitchen a thumbs up on the food, because it is delicious.  However, guess what happened to the bill?  AGAIN? We were overcharged. Our server had her manager 'fix' it for us and we told the owner about the issue.  She claims it's due to an IT issue in the computer.  If the prices don't get rung in by 6 pm, it will not charge the correct price.  Hm, that seems like an issue that should get resolved soon.  How many other folks are getting overcharged and don't notice?  The owner did offer me a free glass of wine for my next visit (should have comped everyone at the table a glass).  Saddens me that the issue still exists and that I have no desire to return to a decent choice of eatery in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Decent food, decent service. \"Jazz\" band needs to be replaced. I've heard better street performers than the pathetic keyboard playing unidentifiable tunes."}
{"text":"Go see Bobby.  The selections of beverages are endless and he knows how to pair it with your favorite foods. Excellent service and great ambience."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try for the first time last night and really enjoyed it! The atmosphere was great with live music and indoor or outdoor seating. Wasn't real crowded but there were lots of people there. I had a red wine sangria and my boyfriend had the Freakshow Cab, both were good. We shared the Sonoma salad and it was fantastic! We also ordered the Herb Roasted chicken. The chicken was over cooked and way too dry but our server, Rochelle (who was great!) took care of resolving that for us. Really nice night, we will definitely be going here again!"}
{"text":"Stopped into the Wild Vine Uncorked on a scouting expedition, today. This just-opened wine bar is in the Basha's center at Gilbert and Chandler Heights. I have high hopes for this new eatery. The previous occupants of this space have been only so-so. 

The decor is leather and nailhead seating, both chairs and couches. There is also outside seating for the evenings, and fall through spring. It is quieter here than, say, the Living Room. There is also a full bar, with liquor and beer. Bring your non-wine-drinking friends. Does anyone have any of those?!?

Today, my wife and I stopped in just after the 2pm opening. The staff was prompt, courteous, and just the right amount of attentive. 

We shared the Butcher Block (charcuterie plate) with cheeses, sliced meats, dried fruits, olives, and nuts. This is big enough to be a decent main course for two or appetizers for four. We had the Prisoner Zinfandel 2012 with this. It was a perfect match, bold enough to stand up to the salted ham, fruity enough for the fruit.  This zin is still a bit tannic on the finish. It will be even better in another year.  I highly recommend it. 

For dessert we had the cheesecake with berries and Zinfandel reduction. The cheesecake is awesome! The serving person (Felicia) recommended the Charles&Charles Rosè to pair with the dessert. My wife thought it was perfect. I thought it was a bit too dry to stand up to the creaminess and fruit of the cheesecake. 

The wine list is pretty long right now. They intend to pare it down to only the favorites as time goes by. I would highly recommend that you stop in and have a glass or two of some of the excellent wines offered here, before they are replaced with someone else's choice!"}
{"text":"One of the Hotspot in Chandler. Visited this place on our recent visit to Arizona, and I will defiantly be back. Great atmosphere, and wine selection. Must try the sea bass."}
{"text":"The wine selection was amazing! I wish they had a better and more clear beer menu though as I'm more of a beer drinker. I've eaten there twice now, once was the opening weekend so I held off reviewing to see if they fell off their game. They did not. The sliders are sooooo yummy and the perfect portion so you don't feel all full and sleepy. My fiance had a pasta dish with tomatoes and it tasted so fresh and it was not overcooked. I will definitly go back."}
{"text":"Country music is not the best fit for a wine bar. Jazz or Frank Sinatra would be more appropriate. Love Marlene!!"}
{"text":"Finally a wine bar in the south Chandler area! The food is loaded with flavor. Happy hour prices are decent. Staff is friendly. Owner Kim interacts with customers every time I've been there. It is a wine bar so gotta mention the selection is extensive and diverse. They even carry a few Arizona wines. Definitely recommend Wild Vine Uncorked."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Live Music, Great Food, & Fun. Service was good, very knowledgeable. P.s. Probably the best Bone-in Ribeye In Arizona. A++. 5 Stars Was A Easy Choice."}
{"text":"They have an amazing happy hour.  The calamari is so good, cooked perfectly.  For me, the desserts are the best.  One of the best creme brulee dishes I have ever had in Arizona.  Great atmosphere, too.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Tapas and appetizers were acceptable for a wine bar. Entrees were well below average for the price. However this is a a wine bar so it's all about ambience right? Too much light, too many silver sneakers, too much hardscape, and wine is served out of large-mouthed, thick, margherita-type stemware. Hope they make some changes soon since the padded reviews from friends don't last for long."}
{"text":"service was good! i had a friendly young man as our server. he was very accommodating to our needs, will definitely come back, hope he's working! only downside is they were out of multiple wine choices that they had listed on their menu! would recommend though"}
{"text":"I'm gonna give this place 4 stars. The ambience is fun, very spacious and open seating area but still intimate. Live music from time to time or at least when we were there. The staff are very friendly and down-to-earth. There wasn't a single thing that I didn't like about this location. They even have sliding patio doors and a place to eat outside so I'm sure during the cooler times of the year, this place is a great hang out. Let's get to the food, super impressive! Started off with a couple appetizers the bruschetta board and twisted pretzel logs. Two of three of the bruschetta were amazing the other one was so-so. The pretzel logs and the cheese/mustard was pretty epic. When we got down to brass tax and ordered the main course, that's where things went a little off the reservation. I got the burger that I ordered but my girl got a different burger. Two of the burgers on the menu sounds slightly similar and due to the volume level in this place it was easy to see where the mistake was made. We didn't complain though, that burger turned out to be pretty fabulous and my girl wasn't upset. I am most certain that we will return to try the other burger and make sure we get it ordered correctly next time . I can see this place becoming a regular hang out. Check it out see what you think"}
{"text":"This place was very busy and seemed to be the trendy spot in the area with not much around. The service was good, but not as attentive and professional that you would expect at a place with these prices. The food was just okay...nothing was bad or terrible, but nothing was amazing or made me want to come back for more. We had the ceviche, caprese, calamari (overly greasy) guacamole, empanadas and chicken tostadas.  Out of everything the guacamole was probably the best with the empanadas coming in at a close second. This is a cool place for a drink and tapas; otherwise, pretty run of the mill and unforgettable."}
{"text":"Great place! Love the ambiance! Not a wine drinker but tasted some wine. Surprisingly good! Had beer and other alcoholic beverages. Food pretty good too! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, wine selection, havent found the perfect meal yet but did enjoy the cheese board."}
{"text":"This place has a really cool vibe. I have been here twice. The first time we had really good service and the food was great. Last night it was okay. The server may have been new. She was really slow. A heads up that happy hour was almost over would have been nice. She came over and asked if we wanted food and said happy hour is over when someone tried to order appetizers off that menu. This was at 6:02. I am extremely disappointed you switched the Crispin Cider for Angry Orchard. Angry Orchard is loaded with sugar and tastes awful."}
{"text":"3 is generous.  Good was above par but the service is below par on many levels.  We were seated next to the patio door so the staff were constantly opening and closing it during our meal.  Wait staff and manager were very chatty, unfortunately more with each other than the customers. We were not told about the specials or happy hour either.  It just wasn't welcoming.  It was though service was secondary.   Far removed."}
{"text":"Do not make a yelp reservation here. Our party of four decided to try this place for an evening out. We got placed on the couch with a tv table  for dinner. This was not indicated on our yelp reservation.  We spoke to the manager named, Kelly.  She was completely unhelpful and rude.   She was unwilling to help us despite place being partially empty.  She said we either get the couch with a small table or nothing.  Do not waste your time.  Horrible management-  can't wait for the next place here because this will fail with managers  like this!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service! Curran and mike behind the bar during the day are awesome.  Super pleasant and friendly! Would love to see them more often and even at night.  So happy to have this place as a local spot we frequent. Thanks for opening and being fantastic!  Owners are super friendly and can tell they love what they do! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Still a nice local place with inside/outside seating and large bar. However since last fall I think there has been a change in ownership and/or chefs and not for the better.  Food & service just not as good as it was and I don't know if using that music service was for the better."}
{"text":"First time here & fell in love  The atmosphere was quite relaxing, open and there was live music. We each started off with a beer & the Charcuterie Board. We've had meat & cheese boards at a few places & this would be in the top for sure! The bread was toasted perfectly, more than enough slices of meat. The cheese was delicious & thickly cut. The board also came with olives, strawberries, apple slices, grapes & walnuts. All fresh and very tasty!

We then ordered the Diseno Malbec- yum!! Wine prices were average per glass and bottle. Also ordered the bruschetta, which was decent but definitely have had better. We finished off the night with a bottle of 19 Crimes (Cab). This too was quite delicious. 

Overall we had a great experience & will for sure be back again :)"}
{"text":"Went here for a girls night and had a blast!!! They hadn't been opened very long so things weren't as smooth as they could be. But they definitely fixed that! We met one of the owners who was as sweet as can be!! Really liked the whole ambiance and feel of the place. Food and drinks were great!! We will definitely be back!! Couples night next time!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and had high hopes. Must start by saying the service was very very good. The atmosphere is good as well. We shared a couple of appetizers which were just okay. Not sure about the menu for a wine bar. The worst part of the night was the VERY loud singer that started at 7 pm. Much too loud to have a conversation. Hopefully this will be resolved."}
{"text":"Food was great, wine was ok, but experience was, in all, very bad..food and wine is over priced but my experience with the staff, mainly the manager was terrible..my daughter and i went in to sip wine and have appetizers. The server never introduced herself. We decided while waiting for our food we would go outside and have a smoke and make a phone call, my daughter asked the hostess if we can step outside with our wine for a minute or two and she said that would be fine. So as we are outside, some guy in a very bad looking suit and silly french hat interrupted us with grabbing both our wine glasses and rudely saying, \"you cant drink out here\" my daughter said that the hostess said yes, and this rude guy said \" well, she's wrong\" as he walked away with our wine..I looked at my daughter asking her, \"who the hell was that!???\" Coming back in and sitting down, he never approached us with an explanation nor did our server ever come back..our food and the check was waiting for us...WILL NEVER GO BACK...."}
{"text":"3rd time coming here. First time, our waitress literally touched my food and puts it back on my plate, really! 2nd time, ran out of the steak. Third time, I ordered staple burgers. The pregnant waitress asked me if I want fries or onion rings and I said, \"onion rings\" and I asked if could have ranch instead of ketchup....when I got my check, she charged me 69cents for ranch and $3 for onion rings?! I have never ever been charge for ranch in any restaurant I've been in. I would have said no, if she told me there's an extra charge for ranch and onion rings. It would have been nice if they tell you all these extra charge, don't you think??? Good thing I didn't get charge for my Olives in my martini, geez!!! Other than that I had a great time with my friends. The food was ok. I'll think about it, if I want to come back again."}
{"text":"This place is super cute ,romantic. I went here on a date with my husband and we really loved it, we didn't want to leave."}
{"text":"Great place so comfy with service and atmosphere definently my go to wine bar dinner and wine best ever."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area a few months ago and have been wanting to check out this spot. Wine + bruschetta + live music = yes please! Came here with a friend last night and we had a great time. Josh, our server was so nice and helpful, his wife also works there too. I'm excited to come back with my Husband for a date night hopefully soon, I heard they have live music on Thursday, Fri & Saturday nights. And even dueling pianos once a month.. we'll be a regular here in no time - and bonus points because it's literally right down the street from my house!"}
{"text":"Bruschetta wonderful. Zucchini is with horseradish yumm. Sliders trio good. Ribeye nicely aged meat and tender. Just needed horseradish for a little kick. Disappointed they were out of Brie. Charcuterie board generous and delish.  We will be back to this quaint well done place."}
{"text":"I've been to the wild vine several times and honestly I keep hoping it will be better. The acoustics are terrible. All I hear is people chatting , no music or its too low. Could use some curtains. Next, every time I go the service is terrible. The  wait staff kind of acts like your bothering them and that's if you can get them to stop by your table. Except for the bartender he was very attentive so after a few times we learned to sit at the bar. I took my husband once and we had the cheese board. Not impressed at all. It was heaping with grapes, where was the cheese. Oh. Found it under all the fruit. And a cold slice of your typical store bought French bread. The whole board was served way to cold. The cheese should be closer to room temp.  The wine was delicious  on the other hand but you can head to bar vinedo and spend the same amount of money for a very impressive cheese board and polished service as well as a great atmosphere. Oh I might I mention my friend had the carrot ginger soup which was yummy till it completely burnt her throat going down. Hmmm must have been microwaved cause the rest seemed fine.  Give up on this place."}
{"text":"Ambience, wine and beer selections, and food are absolutely amazing! Perfect place to gather with friends and family and relax!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, menu choices, and live music is what we look forward to on a weekend night!"}
{"text":"Been a long while since I've actually sat down for a meal here - It was very very good! The overall experience was very pleasant and the music was great!! I would love to hear your feedback either way: the food; the presentation awesome. 
Try and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ambience is very good
The food was just average and a little high in price. We had sandwiches and a couple of beers and our tab was close to $50.
The demographic was 40 ish
Played music at a comfortable volume
Service was good
We liked the ambience enuf that we will make a second visit"}
{"text":"\"Are you ready to order?\"  

Our first time here was pretty impressive.  This is a beautiful space.  It's very comfortable, well decorated, and clean.  The wine list is extensive and the menu has plenty of options for sharing or going solo.

\"Everything ok here, can I get you anything else?\"

We had the Butcher Block which was just ok.  It came with a few cheeses and meats, some olives, and bread.  Nothing really stood out.

\"Can I take that plate away?\"

Next we had a grilled chicken salad (great), the empenadas (very good), calamari (ok), pan de ajo (very good), and the bruschetta (ok).

\"Everything ok?  Need some more wine?\"

The service, if you haven't picked up on it, was a little much.  I think the training probably lacked.  The wine was poured without tasting, there were questions of how everything tasted after nearly every bite, we were asked what else we wanted no less than 10 times, and the check was picked up the second I signed it.  I guess too much is better than too little but just as awkward.

\"Happy holidays, you folks have a good weekend.\"

There was live music on Saturday night which was nice as well.

Prices were reasonable.

\"Oh, you're still here...anything else I can you?  No?  Well then, have a happy holidays.  Enjoy your weekend.  Are you sure you don't want some more wine?\""}
{"text":"First time here and loving the tapas, good wine selection and live music. Awesome.  Tried their shrimp and sliders appetizers.  All very good."}
{"text":"Oh wow this place! 

We stopped to have a quick lunch and were so impressed we came back for dinner and had friends meet up with us. 

The tapas here are great! We had a margherita pizzette which was well balanced with cheese and sauce. We also check in to yelp for a free tapa (lunch time) and instead of it being a small peon thing. It was an actual tapa from the menu. The pretzels with beer cheese were huge and so well cooked! The sauces paired perfectly together and were so sweet then savory! What a surprise!

We got a charcuterie plate for one of our dinner tapas and it was pretty good. I think I've had better but it sure looked pretty. The crostinis were big and nice and the sliders were very yummy. Although a buddy of mine said he liked the chicken by far the best out of the three. 

We also got the chicken tostadas which to me were pretty good but I needed a bit more pickled onions or maybe hot sauce? Idk. I tend to like things packed with flavor. This highlighted the chicken itself which my meat loving hubs appreciated and preferred. 

Don't let the name of this place fool you. They have a full bar with crafted cocktails as well as an extensive beer and wine list. 

The oversized couches and lives music just rounded out the perfect experience to sip wine or a cocktail and lounge with friends while grazing on yummy food. My kinda heaven!"}
{"text":"Great food with a nice atmosphere.  Defiantly a place for the ladies.  The prices were a little inflated."}
{"text":"Our favorite local joint close to home. Not a typical pretentious wine bar in South Chandler. Just local folks having a drink or few. The bartender(the guy) serves the best Toasted Old Fashion. Their Tapas servings is ok, could be better. But the beer cheese with pretzel is the star of their Tapas menu so far. For the price of the Tapas, maybe add more food? But we will definitely be back. Hopefully next week there will be more food on the Tapas plate. Lol"}
{"text":"Went to have a nice evening of wine and dinner to celebrate my birthday.  First negative - they did not have non-alcoholic beer.    I ordered a glass of house wine (figured it should be good since it is a wine bar).   It was served extra warm and the bottle had obviously been opened yesterday.   It was TERRIBLE! The waitress even said it was not a good brand of wine.  ??? Really??  Ordered the calamari, which came as a  1/2 plate of very crispy pieces.  Then decided to order the shrimp skewers, which came as 4 med. size shrimp on 2 pieces of bread.   By this time, my husband and I were drenched in sweat.  It was no less than 85 to 90 degrees in the restaurant.   We left with a $40 tab and ate dinner elsewhere.   Will not be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and very nice spot. Lots of beers and wines available! Happy hour only goes until 6pm, but lots of great options.

Would be a great spot for a date night."}
{"text":"The Ribeye is the best around. Period. Had an amazing Chimichanga last week (found on the 'secret' menu) and love the live music."}
{"text":"Been there three times, all were good!  The lamb lollipops were delicious! I didn't find anything that we didn't like. My husband is gluten free and they Gf bruschetta, he was in heaven! I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Second time coming in here. 
The first time the food was over seasoned and the service was sub par. 
I am writing this review as I sit at the bar for our second time in. The happy hour seems decent but $2 off the tapas is not a bad deal. Until it takes over 20 minutes to get them. We ordered the calamari and humus. The humus was good but could use more 
veggies. The calamari was room temperature, tough, and bland. The dipping sauce was lacking flavor as well.
I am really trying to like this place. I want to become a regular. The service is making it hard. We were the only 2 people at the bar for almost an hour and the bartender come to check on us 3 times and 2 of those were when we ordered. 
I hope things get better. However 3 strikes and I will be out. So hope next time is better.


Update -----
Also took 20 minutes for the new bartender between check-in's to see if we wanted more wine. Guess what I said ... That's right, we will take our check please."}
{"text":"We decided on this restaurant for our anniversary from the recommendation of friends. The atmosphere was perfect! Josh greeted us and is one of the most amazing waiters we have ever had, he made recommendations on wine and food. We went with his recommendations, everything was absolutely amazing! The food was prepared perfectly, the drinks were amazing, the service was 5 star. After dinner we sat at the bar and spoke with Irish who also had great recommendations, he was funny, friendly and we will definitely be back to visit with him. This place is our new favorite restaurant and bar. We can't wait to go on a weekend when they have live music."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, had the sliders and pork tacos which were both delicious. A bit pricey however this place should do very well as the staff and service were excellent."}
{"text":"Wanted to come here because of the reviews. This place was nothing special. We arrived and were told we couldn't sit inside, because they were saving the tables for their piano night. We ordered only Tapas: artichoke hearts, calamari, sliders and the bread. The best item was the bread! It was some of the best bread I've ever had. However, the other three items were nothing to be wowed about. It was decent and extremely filling, but all really heavy. Beautiful restaurant inside, vibe was good, but the food wasn't the best just average."}
{"text":"An update from my review from 8/28/2016. Kimberly, the owner has been reaching out to me to better understand my 1 Star review from previous 4 Star reviews. There seem to have been a miss understanding on their end which was resolved fairly quickly.

So I will give Kimberly a 5 Star for CUSTOMER Service. Thank you Kimberly!"}
{"text":"We heard about this place and were hoping to make it our new hang out but when we arrived we were told that we had to sit outside. We had made a reservation and no one asked me if I wanted to sit indoors or outdoors. It happened to be very cold plus the outside faces a parking lot! The hostess could not accommodate us so we asked for the manager who was even worse. She actually wanted the hostess to call other customers who had later reservations to see if they would sit outside so she could give us an indoor table!  Then they finally decided they could seat us indoors but it was at a sofa with low tables We had planned on eating dinner; four of us. Who wants to eat dinner like that?? So we walked out and will never go back."}
{"text":"Recently changed menu, no entrees (was best sea bass in Phx) just very expensive finger food. No Saturday night entertainment any longer, looks like they are struggling. Plus is it's now easy to get a seat at the bar..."}
{"text":"The most amazing Bruschetta in AZ! Your search is over 

I decided to try The Wild Vine since we recently moved accords the street to Circle G. Their wine selection is amazing, the price is great, and the food truly fantastic. We had the Rib Eye and was cooked to perfection. Their selection of small bites or Tapas is delicious and amazingly priced during HH. 

Please call in advance for reservations since the place gets packed on weekends. The live music is fantastic. The staff is super courteous and the planned events like the dueling pianos are a blast. 

Great job for a local wine bar. We will visit more in the future"}
{"text":"I know that based on Yelps \"algorithms\" that this won't make it on their front page, and that will be shameful. 

My fiancée and i showed up tonight for an evening of celebration. We were the only people in the dining area, but when we asked if we could sit in a particular seat, we were told they were reserved in case they get a party of four. Ok...

So, we sat down. The waitress asked if we'd been in before, we told her no, we drove over 15 miles after buying a Groupon as we had something to celebrate. She begins to show us the Happy Hour menu WITHOUT explaining that whatever we ordered on HH wouldn't be included. After two glasses of wine and an appetizer, i went to order a steak. Nope, they were out of steak except for one cut. So, then i ordered the \"special\" meatloaf with a side of broccoli. When it came, i was told they were out of broccoli and just has asparagus on the plate. No apologies. Their menu had a cranberry aioli listed...out of that too 

Then the tab comes and we are told we can't use the Groupon. $20 for flipping meatloaf and i can't use a Groupon?!? Such shitty service. I won't be back and pray you don't spend $90 on their crappy service either!"}
{"text":"Very cool vibe & quaint place. Love the cheese board. I was going to have it as an appetizer, but it was more than plenty for me for a meal. There was 6 of us, and we did have a bit of a problem with the separate checks. One of our items was on another couples bill and vice versa. Took a couple of times to get that worked out, but assuming someone was just having a bad day. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were okay.  We ordered the sourdough with butter and roasted garlic.  The bread was great with the roasted garlic, but the sweet butter didn't pair well.  The plain butter we asked for was better.  The margherita pizza was missing flavor.  My friends sliders trio was great.  We both had the same Blue Margarita drink mine was good hers was very strong.  The staff was friendly and professional.  The music was great!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, yummy food! Didn't have a very attentive server but we would definitely go again! Something different than what's in the area."}
{"text":"Atmosphere....beautiful. Service....perfect. Drinks...good. Food.....not so good. It's fine....just nothing special whatsoever for the price you pay. Just make sure to avoid the entrées at all costs. $20 for five unseasoned shrimps with some quinoa on the side is not cool. They definitely need to lower the price on these entrées or get another chef."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place! Upscale trendy yet a speakeasy vibe. Fun entertainment too! Food was good and beautiful ambience perfect for date night or a night out with the ladies!"}
{"text":"This is very nearly a 4 star review. Only a few irksome items prevented that - but even then, it is not a 5 star Yelpsperience.

The Wild Vine is located in a shopping center. My GPS was unsure on this subject but we found it. We had a large party (7) with a reservation and were seated quickly. We chose a half booth option; the couch along one side of the table looked very comfortable. Unfortunately it was so low that my collarbones were even with the tabletop. Why would you buy couches like that and not match the height to your tables? 

The waitress was kind but distracted. We ordered almost every small/family plate they offered due to our large party, and they took over 20 minutes to come out. Yes, we were a sizable group. But the restaurant was 50+% empty. 

I (24 year old female) made the reservation. I approached the maitre'd. I was the first to speak to the waitress, and I ordered the food. And yet every single time she approached the table, she spoke to the oldest male seated - addressed him as if he were our leader. She also gave the check to him and it had to be passed to me. It was a minor detail that got more annoying each time the older man in our party pointedly turned and looked at me in response to a question.

I would probably go back and try them again, but I'm not in a hurry about it."}
{"text":"I stopped in for 1 glass of wine last week and ended up stay the whole night. I started with a glass of wine that they suggested and it was perfect. So I decided to try some food. The lollipop Lamb chops are from heaven. So after that I decided to have another glass of wine since everything else was perfect so far. Well the next glass of Red wine was even better than the first. Then to top it all off I ended up sitting and talking to a beautiful woman who ended up being the owner Kim who was amazing and very pleasant .  I am in love with everything about The Wild Vine!!!! This place worth the drive. The Piano is an added plus that I loved."}
{"text":"It was nice, had better, had much worse. Try it for yourself, you might have s different experience."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is so good! The fish n chips are the best and not greasy! I also had the chicken lettuce wraps and very good. My girlfriends and I shared a bottle of wine, I love that you can take the bottle with you if you don't finish it. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"The wine selection is superb, with my favorite red wine blend, Prisoner, being served the times I was there. The bar menu is short, with the mixed sliders being the best thing I've tried. Great ambience for either date night or casual get together."}
{"text":"For a new spot in south chandler this place is amazing! So happy to have a wine bar in our area. The staff was brand new so that's my only issue but they will get better. Yummy food, ambiance, live music on Saturday night. Live the brick walls and open patio."}
{"text":"We had been here on one previous occasion just for drinks which was late on a Saturday night and we wanted to make sure we came back to try the food. We went last night (Friday night at 6:30). I decided to make a reservation just in case it was busy. When I called to make the reservation it appeared that the girl that answered the phone might have been new as she had to ask if she could take a reservation. She seemed rushed and a little on the \"short side\". When we arrived there were 3 girls at the hostess station and the place was pretty busy. We were seated right away at a table nearest the line of traffic from the kitchen and the bar. There are quite a few people working during this time so it was quite distracting to have constant foot traffic by bussers, wait staff, bar patrons and hostesses. We waited at least 10 minutes before we finally got a waitress. Ordered a glass of wine and my husband ordered a beer. He was hoping for better choices but was okay with it. (No local beers).. I ordered the Colossal Shrimp & Quinou and my husband got the Filet special with fingerling potatoes. I couldn't eat the Quinou as my first bite appeared crunchy and undercooked. I just left that alone as I didn't care for the flavor at all. The shrimp was very tasty and a good size shrimp. My husband enjoyed his filet. Overall.. our experience was just okay unfortunately. I am thinking if we were seated somewhere a bit more out of the line of traffic it would have been a nicer experience. We were right next to her bar as well and there was a guy standing right behind my husband visiting with a few patrons at the bar. Next time we'll either ask to be seated outside or in a less busy location. I would like to try a few other items on the menu so we will be coming back and hopefully for a better experience."}
{"text":"Really extensive menu for a wine bar.  Food was great, environment is comfortable and chic.  Nice to have a place with live music locally too!  We will definitely be having many a future date nights here!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out. It being a wine bar and super close to the house, East valley doesn't have a lot of that. We walked in, it had the visual vibe of a wine bar, but the music was more of a depressing country folk which didn't match the atmosphere. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left was terrible. It took several minutes for someone to greet us and seat us when we were one of the 3 parties there. Once we sat, it took another 10 minutes for someone to finally greet us at our table. We ordered the most expensive glass of wine, which tasted like vinegar. It took them  half hour to bring out our food which was separate from the rest of our party. Got our drinks wrong, and missed a few things we ordered. The fish tasted like it was frozen then over cooked. I will recommend no one eat here. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Really great place to take guests from out of town. The ambiance is very upscale but relaxed, the beer and wine lists are fantastic, the service is great, and  we were very impressed by the food. We had a larger group, and we all ordered different things, and I can honestly say everything was excellent. I would recommend the beet salad, the chicken Marsala, and the salmon. I think this will become our new special occasion place."}
{"text":"We stopped in for Happy Hour yesterday. We decided to sit at the bar.  We ordered the warm olives and they were good. We also ordered the pretzels. There were 3 pretzels about 6 inches long with a very small serving of sauce for that amount of bread. The drink service is slow. We had to order twice to get a glass of wine. We also ordered sliders that never came.  We wanted to watch an MLB game on one of the TVs. Neither bar tender could find it even though we were watching it on Directv at home and they have Directv there. The bartender assured us it would be replayed. Save your time and patience...try another place. You really shouldn't have scented candles in a restaurant. It seems smells like a gas station bathroom."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Atmosphere is elegant. Chef Mike is one of a kind! He is super friendly. They just changed their hours from opening at 3 to now 4. We were unaware and he let us in at 3 and served us happily. He struck great conversations with us and even ran next door to get raspberries for one of our cocktails. I was very impressed with his dedication. I have been several times and have never been disappointed in device, wine, or food. Happy hour has a great menu hearty or light dishes. Great prices as well. Pan de ajo  is a great starter. I always go for the uncorked sliders and bruschetta. For a nice dinner with the spouse the live music, wine,  and food can not be beaten."}
{"text":"Pricey. For what it is.

The ambiance here gets 4.5 stars. No doubt. 

The service here is definitely 4.5 stars.

The food here is a solid 3.

The pricing is a 2.

All the tapas are around $13-15. For $15 you would expect to get something more than a few bites of lamb lollipops that have little to no seasoning at all.

The sliders tasted like they were a microwaved burger and not cooked over a flame at all.

The pulled chicken tostadas also were dry and had little flavor.

The tables are all off balanced and rock back and forth which is SUPER annoying while you're trying to eat.

The live entertainment was very nice and we need more of that on this side of town.

The drinks prices are out of bounds. Like $13 for a Old Fashioned made with Bulliet. For that price it should be made with something much nicer. It was a rear old fashioned though even though I was missing a nice high quality luxardo cherry 

All in all a very nice place that needs to get their pricing in order. Will likely try again sometime."}
{"text":"The wife and I went here for dinner. We have been here before and have always enjoyed the food and wine. The charcuterie plate is always one of our favorites and the bruchetta is always amazing.  But tonight we had no idea what we were in for. The ownership has broight a new side to the place...high end craft cocktails.  As we sat at the bar we got to meet Darren. Darren has created these drinks and watchimg him make them was like having a show right in front of us.  The technique and care taken to create each drink was like watching a artist at work. My favorite was the old fashioned but I did not have a drink I did not enjoy.   We have always enjoyed this place but now we will frequent this place even more."}
{"text":"We had such high hopes! Went in on Saturday evening and just loved the decor!  We were initially seated near the bar area but the rock music was so loud, we couldn't really even talk to each other. Asked to be moved and all was well. Ordered wines, yes wineS. Each time we ordered a wine, the server would come back to say they were out of the wine. It was really strange, for what we thought was a wine bar..... We were looking for a nice big cab for hubby and the young man that was our server thought big meant popular. We finally did get a red and a white and they were good.  We asked what the entrees were and one was \"a ribeye\". No more info than that. Ended up ordering bruchetta which was wonderful. Then on to sliders that were also really delicious.  

We will probably give this place another try down the road."}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant. I had a great glass of wine from Oregon that paired deliciously with the stuffed portobello mushrooms, which was the special for the night. It was a very relaxing, enjoyable evening!!! Definitely be back. Chef Stacy is amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this early evening during HaPpY hour and found they have added a much fuller menu. We all ordered food and drinks...all were great and my Merlot wine was delicious. Fun place...a little pricey for me...but I'm sure I will return."}
{"text":"Good food,drinks and atmosphere. The rating would have been 5 stars if it wasn't for running out of products that were required for my wife's drinks that she had ordered. The staff however did run out to basha's next door to accommodate what they could. My wife and I did appreciate that effort very much. We will definitely be back and would recommend the wild vine uncorked to our friends and family. The butcher block was a great starter and a must have. This place is somewhat pricey so be ready to spend money but it's worth it especially if the live performance is good like it was on the night we were there. Jeff was the performer on our night. His sets had good sound quality that were low enough that you could still talk to each other and not have to shout. It was well done over all."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice. Good place to relax, listen to live band and have drinks. Food was just ok. Ordered lamb chops, son said they were very tasty. Pan de ajo was good. Calamari was a little over done. Chicken letucce wraps was just ok. More sauce than meat. Fish and chips had no flavor. You can tell the fish was frozen. Drinks were good though. Service was slow. We sat on the patio and waited 20 mins for our drinks. We ended up going to the bar to get our drinks and when we got back our waitress brought our drinks."}
{"text":"I was really surprised this place wasn't popping for Friday afternoon happy hour... maybe it's the location, everything up and coming but just not there yet.

Our server was very flighty, but good, everything flowed well. 

Yelp brought me in with the bone in ribeye. They look so amazing, right!? Well they didn't have bone in ribeye... but did have a ribeye. It had good flavor but was extremely fatty, I expect some but it was pretty much every bite. The asparagus were huge and very under cooked. 

The shrimp appetizer was amazing, I really wanted to order another one but my husband told me no.... 

Slider trio was fun and full of flavors.

But I really want to point out the kids menu. Thank you. It was our anniversary but we ended up stuck out of town with kids for work. We love going to nice restaurants but always feel guilty bringing kids. Even though we have very well behaved kids 95% of the time. We went for an early dinner just not to bother other ppl. But I instantly felt at easy when they brought out the kids menu. They did not have Mac and cheese on their regular menu (that I noticed) so that typically means Kraft out of the box... nope! They made their own and it was amazing, should really add a jazzed up regular menu version. Also, had carrots as an option! Not sure why there's a $2.50 upcharge for veggies though. 

We also never order off the kids menu cause it's often filled with crap but this place really made a great kids menu. It's very very rare and very much appreciated!"}
{"text":"Just ate there for the last time.  \"How is your shrimp\", the waitress asked.  \"Actually, it was extremely dry and over cooked\", I replied politely. \"Oh, that's weird . . . I'll have them cook a fresh plate and see\".  (But not for me . . . She never brought it up again).  The bill came and the shrimp was still on it.  Ok, I'm not going to complain in the crowded patio area in front of other guests.  But what really disappointed was the $5 coupon from a manager that never came to the table to address the poorly cooked shrimp.  The waitress acted awkward as she explained the manager's rationale.  \"Since you guys ate two shrimp it didn't seem fair to refund the whole amount\".  

I live 2 miles away, was in for the first time last week and had a decent experience (pan de ajo is really good) . . . this visit will be the LAST . . . I gave the coupon to the hostess on the way out to give to the manager . . . And explained why.  She literally cared less.  

WHAT RESTAURANT DOESN'T TAKE POORLY PREPARED FOOD OFF THE BILL ?  

DON'T ASK HOW THINGS TASTE IF YOU REALLY DON'T CARE.

AND $5 OFF NOTHING IS NOTHING"}
{"text":"Couldn't have been better! Excellent wait staff, beautiful music, wonderful food... Romantic date night that turned out perfect, we highly recommend. Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 4 stars but the owner needs to choose a better hostess to greet and seat the public that will be spending their money here. The ambience is great, food is good, waiter/waitress service excellent but the initial impression of some teenager who thinks they know it all and acts like a complete snob is enough for me to honestly hesitate when I am trying to decide where my wife and I go for some drinks and tapas. I guess most can get over this but to me the first impression sets my mood for my evening and this is the 2nd time I've come here where the same girl that greets the customers needs to learn some proper etiquette on customer service."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for nitrate laced cold cuts, terrible wine list, and lousy service this is your place!  The owners are incredibly rude and arrogant!  This is the worst dining experience we have ever had in the Valley!  There are much better places like Postino's or the Living Room close by where you do not have to be treated poorly by the \"owners\"  of a third rate copy cat, wannabe with zero atmosphere or class."}
{"text":"This wine bar is pretty close to our house so we try to stop in whenever I want a glass of wine. 

For drinks, I've tried some of their red wines, Pinot noir, which are pretty good. They also have a separate cocktail menu. I think it's like a rotating menu because I've never been able to order the same drinks. I've tried a chocolate martini, coconut cocktail, and a white wine sangria. All delicious!! For food, I've tried the pork belly, gourmet meat pizza, and the pasta. If I remember correctly, I thought the pasta was a bit bland. 

The service has always been good, and they have a cute outdoor patio. I recommend making a reservation if you come because they get packed."}
{"text":"This place was a hidden gem in chandler walking in the atmosphere was great huge couches to sky in and a long table in the middle for a big group. We sat at the bar that made laid out in there perfect shape with plenty of room and blue lights under the table top to make it pop. 

The bartender Irish was awesome very helpful and very quick with the drinks. The food was amazing we did have one hiccup with the food which was fixed right away and they were very apologetic for it 

High recommend this spot , we will be back thank you for a good experience."}
{"text":"All I can say is the customer service was above beyond excellent. There was an empty glass plate left behind a question and answered nothing. The waitress Felicia loved her very knowledgeable very tentative to our needs. She smiled she was very friendly she made suggestions. She made very great suggestions may I add!!!! The food was delicious very beautiful display the wind was very good I can't think of one thing that I could complain about. I have been wanting to go here and so my daughter and son n law offered to take me out. And it was so worth it. I will highly recommend this place to all my friends. And I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Tried the Vine for the 1st time for a casual busines dinner after a recommendation. I had  people in from out of town including my boss. We had a great time and everyone loved the place! The ambiance is very cool comfortable and relaxed and nicely decorated. Our waiter was fantastic and service and friendliness was spot on. We enjoyed lamb chops and shrimp skewers for appetizers and both were amazing. The lamb was perfectly cooked and both were excellently seasoned. For entrees we had  prime rib French dip, the fish special was cod and I had the pasta with shrimp. Every thing was so good we all cleaned our plates. We finished with chocolate lava cake and a creme brulee. I can't wait to go back.
We'll done guys I'm sure you'll do great!"}
{"text":"Best date night spot! From the food and drinks to the service, nothing short of a perfect night.

Made dinner reservations for 6:30 and got there a little early, was still seated right away. Lots of bar seating, high tops, lounge seating and tables. The place was filled with what I'd say to be a little older, mature crowd. They have live music that starts at 8pm and they draw in a crowd.

Started with the bruschetta, all three was fantastic. I had the rib-eye and my husband ordered lamb chops and crab cakes. Everything was flavorful and cooked to perfection. 

The service was spot on! Our server was attentive and the bartender even came to see if we needed another drink. Everyone was friendly and we even got recommendations of places to visit since we are new to the area.

We'll be back for date night without the kids!!"}

{"text":"I have very high hopes for this place.

We arrived around 3:00 on a Friday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised by their happy hour specials (2-6PM every day) - $2 selected tapas (apps) and house wines for $5. 

We sat at the bar and I started with the Miner Chardonnay ($17 a glass, but worth every penny), while my hubby picked a draft beer (also $2 off during happy hour - so $4). We also had the bruschetta (you get to choose 4 of 6 options - $9 HH) and the \"Pan de Ajo\" (sourdough bread & roasted garlic - $2 HH).

The bruschetta was good but be warned that it is not like Postino's - we could have each had our own, and for the $9 price it would have been worth it. We liked every flavor we tried except for the verde. 

The Pan de Ajo stole the show! A wonderful, warm, fresh baked (circle) loaf of sourdough (accompanied with a soft butter) and a half of bulb of delicious roasted garlic - absolutely amazing. The best $2 of my life.

I followed my Miner Chardonnay with their $5 house / HH Concannon (sp?) house Chard and loved it after my taste buds forgot the complex (and amazing) flavors of the Miner.

Being so early, we were surprised by the amount of people coming in, hopefully this means they will be a big hit and stay open for years to come. 

I cannot wait for the weather to cool down and to take advantage of their open air dining room to patio (one of those full wall windows that will completely open up to the outside). 

This place was MUCH needed in the 'hood."}
{"text":"I was with a group of people yesterday and they let us sample the new menu that is coming out next week. The new chef has put together some great new dishes. My favorite was the Bruschetta with burrata and prosciutto.  Yum. Can't wait to go back when they have the menu fully rolled out."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and really enjoy this place. For one thing- the location is perfect as there really is not a lot of options for restaurants and bars in the south, southeast valley- bordering gilbert.  Each time I have been here, the crowd has been substantial and eclectic- from the groups of gals out for a GNO- to couples both young and old. Both times there was live music and each was outstanding.  The food menu is not extensive but what is avail is a nice assortment of apps and entrees. I have had the sliders-AMAZING- and the guac queso and chips. The cheese platter also good!  Haven't tried an entree yet- maybe next visit.  The wine selection is substantial as is the beer.  There are happy hour specials as well so depending on your drink of choice, the deals seemed good at $2-$4 off. 

The one thing that really stood out to me was the service. Super busy both times I was there but the service was not lacking in any way. Fast and pleasant!!  

I definitely will be hanging here more often- thrilled to have such a great neighborhood hangout!"}
{"text":"Great place!!! Wine list was fantastic. Apps were sooo good! Our new fav place. They even have live music! We can't wait to go back!"}
