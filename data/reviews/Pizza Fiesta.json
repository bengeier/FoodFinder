{"text":"Love this place.  I always get wings or chicken alfredo.  Everytime i order, im off the phone in under a minute and the delivery is quick.  Definitely my go pizza spot"}
{"text":"Have been a regular customer for months. Will not order from here again based on the lack of competent delivery personnel and/or delivery system.   Food has varied from great to okay but usually good eats.  Placed my order on-line while on a business call.  Although I was aware of incoming calls,I did not have the ability to interrupt to accept especially given the number was not recognized.  Hour and a half later I called on the order.  I was told the driver delivered the food to the the wrong address and that the calls I was getting were from Pizza Fiesta.  I'm not sure how they screwed this up because the order was placed with the correct address.  The house lights were on with the house number clearly visible.  An effective solution would have been to leave a voicemail indicating the situation.  Based on timing I might have been able to still receive the order in a timely manner.  Although they wanted to make it right by placing another order I was beat and didn't want to wait yet again for the order.  I asked to have my card credited but was told they couldn't do that at the store and needed to contact the on-line ordering company.  It was placed directly through their website so I'm calling this a loss and will not use them again personally or for my business.  This is not the first time delivery was an issue."}
{"text":"The pizza was great. Portions were really true to size (i.e small pizza was what I expected) Very fast delivery (said 45 min but were here much sooner) I gave it a 4 because I did not l like the wings. I am from buffalo though, the home of the chicken wing so I am pretty biased."}
{"text":"Food size and quality is inconsistent, perpetually wrong. Called and complained, and their English is so poor they couldn't understand what I was saying, tried taking it as a new order."}
{"text":"I order a medium pizza from this place. When the driver arrived I gave him a $20 dollar bill he argued with me saying my $20 was fake. It wasn't until my I scream at him and put the $20 dollar bill up to the light then the driver was like oh okay. He turnt me off so bad I told him I no longer wanted the pizza and I'm not ordering from pizza fiesta ever again!"}
{"text":"I order a large chicken tenders with fries and the broccoli puffs. This place was awful. The food was late for delivery, cold when arrived, stale and rubbery. It was such low quality. I called for a refund and all they offered were more of their bad food. The large chicken tenders only came with 3 pieces!  I would never order from them again."}
{"text":"Let me tell you right away that I love pizza. I eat pizza more than any other food...and still stay slim somehow). We tried food from Pizza Fiesta several times now and I absolutely loved almost everything. Pizza was very tasty, hoagies are also good...they are big ...16 inch. Yep 16 inch. Steak hoagie and buffalo chicken are my favorite. Wings were fried , I usually like baked ones, but these were ok too. I tried their steak calzone ones and was good too...plenty amount of cheese and meat, very delicious...especially when you are so hungry!  Delivery was never late ...always on time."}
{"text":"Have ordered jumbo wings from here in the past and they were some of the better wings I have had.  This time however, much different.  The garlic wings have no flavor to them  and that is extremely hard to do if using garlic.  Did I catch them on a bad night or have things changed?"}
{"text":"It seems like staff doesn't listen to customers' directions very well. I've ordered from this place twice for my lunch break and twice they've delivered my food thirty minutes earlier than what I asked for, despite my clearly stating the time my break was. This is a problem if your lunch break is at a certain time. So I end up using valuable break minutes to go down and receive food that I have to wait another thirty minutes to eat, by which time it's lukewarm and/or soggy.  The first time, I let it go, but this time I called to register a complaint and was told that the delivery man would come back in thirty minutes (what good is that going to do?) and then was hung up on (I called her back and she denied doing it). Maybe there's a language problem (I see others have also noted this); maybe they just need to clean out their ears and actually try to to give a damn.   Needless to say, I have no interest ordering from a place that has no interest in meeting its customers needs. These people clearly have no idea what they're doing and no interest in trying to learn.  If the food were at least interesting that would be the saving grace, but it's generic, and average at best.   Avoid."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza but it needs more sauce.  Good, chewy crust.  Fast delivery and the food arrived hot."}
{"text":"Food was so delicious, worth going out of your way for. The delivery process was a little bit inefficient for my order, HOWEVER, the staff here is 10/10."}
{"text":"I would really like this review to go VIRAL because they delivered something that was so much more than a pizza, it was a gift to my soul sister from afar. I live in NYC and wanted to do something special for my friend's birthday and asked (pleaded) that they help me do something creative with the pie.   They DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!! Pizza Fiesta not only wrote \"Happy Birthday\" beautifully in the box, but they made the pizza into the shape of a heart, and lined the edges with pepperoni. IT WAS A GOSH DARN WORK OF ART!!!  My friend was thrilled to say the least, not to mention she said it was delicious.   It's people like the workers at Pizza Fiesta who are the unsung heroes of the food industry. They do things out of the kindness of their hearts while also delivering quality.   A million thanks to Pizza Fiesta for saving the day!!!!"}
{"text":"How long does it take to make a god damn hoagie? You throw some meet on a sandwich and put it in the oven. Walk three minutes and put it in my hands."}
{"text":"Pizza Fiesta isn't phenomenal, but the deals they have are great. Namely, the College Special. You get a large cheese, family breadsticks, and one liter of soda for like $16. Also, you're going to want to get the ranch. The ranch here is unreal and I actually can't find anything comparable.  The pizza is truly nothing to write home about. I have had it both dine-in and for delivery, and it always seems to be a little chewy and perhaps overdone. But when you're drunk, cheap pizza is cheap pizza. The guys on the phone are nice enough, but it gets a little creepy when they call my \"sweetie\" over and over again. Like, they're foreign, but every girl is not a sweetie, and I am 100% not part of that population.  All in all, Pizza Fiesta is ok. It certainly is food when I'm drunk and I need food. (PS-no one has ever asked for my college ID when I ordered over the phone. Not to be an ass, but, Just Do It, 28-year-old dudebro.)"}
{"text":"These wagz are everything !! We had the wings and fries are everything !! We stopped here after the Pe rally."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their shrimp pizza is amazing and delivery is always super quick! Causes me to eat pizza far more than I should! No better place for pizza downtown"}
{"text":"GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO COME HERE - I'm from tx and this is the best pizza I've ever tasted in my 24 (almost 25 since its 2016) years of life!"}
{"text":"I love the name of this place, I love the fact that they are trying to mash it up.  With a name that kind of evokes an Italian Mexican chain, it's not what you are really getting.  One of the other things that I really appreciate of this place is that they deliver to a huge amount of neighborhoods circling around the downtown area.  Since I started out on writing my review for this place I have ordered at least twice from here.  Both times I was not disappointed.  Both times I was full.  My first order was one of their bread twists.  I had the pepperoni variety.  If you need a visual for this, just think of everything that you would put on a pizza, minus the sauce, stuffed inside some bread that is in the shape of a C.  Only minus the sauce on the inside, why, because you get a side of marinara on the side with some ranch (more on that later) on the side.  It was good, so good that I ate it all in one sitting.    My next order here was a salad.  With a mix of iceberg and spring mix lettuce I wasn't let down by this.  Add in some cucumbers, red onions, and tomatoes I was sold.  I had opted for some of that ranch dressing I mentioned prior.  What is so good about it?  It's homemade.  So good, definitely not store bought.  I thank you for this due to my allergies, I could actually enjoy a ranch dressing again.  You've definitely earned another repeat customer in me.   Woot Woot!  Review #700"}
{"text":"Ordered thier chicken Alfredo for dinner, tasted fine. Woke up vomiting. First and last experience here."}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite pizza shop! It was sooo easy to order & because i did order online it came with free breadsticks! No other pizza shop has a special like this. The food was exceptional also. Will definitely be ordering again.   I ordered a 16\" pizza , Italian Hoagie , 12pc Wings & got breadsticks free from ordering online."}
{"text":"I have been in the hospital for about a month and pizza fiesta is my go to when I have a room full of family! Pizza is amazing! The fiesta rolls are my favorite, spinach and feta!! 5 stars all the way around!"}
{"text":"This place is really good and delivers to me! Yay! Their pizza is good and their gyros are GREAT. And they deliver really fast. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Stopped here with some coworkers, who were attempting to try all the pizza downtown has to offer.  Overall, not bad at all. The pizza was tasty and affordable, and they have a big dining area which wasn't cramped at all, even at lunchtime.  The atmosphere was a little shady (we were informed that they didn't keep napkins in the dining area because \"people kept stealing them\"), and I don't think I'd take a date here, but overall this is a solid lunchtime place if you work dahntahn and like a good slice of pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza Fiesta has moved to 14 Smithfield Street (next to Peppi's)   The pizza has seemed to have gotten better. They make a great side salad. Their lunch special is slice, salad & drink for $5.99.   Since moving, there is no longer a dining area. There may be a chair or two inside, but that's about it. My coworker is still in love with this place and treated me to lunch again today.   The only downside (besides no seating) is that they dont have sugar. I got an unsweetened tea and asked for sweetner. She said they dont have sugar and that they also have sweet tea. awkward"}
{"text":"Office place large order for lunch ($50), it never arrived. When we called they said it \"was delivered\" to the front office, apparently the delivery person just dumped the order or somebody accepted our lunch. Thanks for nothing..."}
{"text":"Pizza Fiesta is a great place to get pizza. I go to college at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. Whenever I have to eat after getting out of night class, I usually go to Pizza Fiesta (if I can afford at the time). And I also recommend the provolone sticks! provolone sticks=cheesy goodness! XD"}
{"text":"Pizza Fiesta surprisingly delivered out to us in Beechview, and the pizza was excellent as was the hoagie. I liked the Sugar Balls too."}
{"text":"My friends and I have ordered Pizza Fiesta many times when we hang out at his house in the North Side.  Easily the best pizza I have ever had!  We usually order them off Grubhub because it's easy and convenient and it is usually late night after we go out.  The leftovers the next day are the best!  Great taste."}
{"text":"Ordered food at 10pm. It arrived at 1am when it said 11:45 at the latest. I gave 2 stars because they offered me 20% off on the next order; however, when the delivery guy arrived, instead of knocking on the door, he yelled through my open living room window. As a woman, home alone, it was slightly terrifying. Service is usually good here, but this will make me reconsider ordering here again."}
{"text":"blech.  this isn't pizza.  the steak hoagie tasted decent, but that's not steak either... then again this wouldn't be worst decision you could make at 1AM"}
{"text":"Love Pizza Fiesta! I never thought of ordering pizza downtown considering I don't live down there (and there are many pizza places closer to me), but after being introduced to it, why not?   Everything I've tried has been very good. Nothing that makes me go crazy, but well worth the price. They also have a ranch dressing that is very tasty!   What keeps me going back, however, is the prices. Everything is fairly cheap. Also, if you order and get it delievered, they have it at your house withing 30-45 minutes. It's probably the quickest pizza place I've ever ordered from! They also are open till early morning which is good for when you're hungry and don't feel like cooking at 1 a.m.   The only problem is sometimes they tend to forget things. Once they forgot my drink and another time we asked for hot garlic wings and they only gave us garlic. Not anything to really complain about, but definitely something to keep in mind."}
{"text":"Not great, not bad.  Just one girl appeared to be working when we found the place.  Short walk across the bridge from Station Square.    Pizza was creative and tasty, hoagie I got was crispy and good as well.  It was pretty hot in there, but I just don't think PGH is used to handling that kind of heat.  The other review is correct about the napkins being hidden away a little, but we had no problem getting a few."}
{"text":"WORST RESTAURANT IN TOWN.  The first time I ordered from them, there was a bug in my food and it took two hours to get to me in the first place.  I wanted to be fair and give the place another try.  The second time, the food took 2 1/2 hours to get to me.  I cancelled the order and told them I wanted a refund a half hour before it arrived.  They refused to refund and hung up on me.  TERRIBLE BUSINESS RUN BY THIEVES.  UTTERLY DISGUSTED.  STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"food was good but driver was ignorant. mind your own business sir, and I'm never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"A couple months ago when our daughter was in Children's Hospital, I was walking around with my fiancé looking for someplace to eat. We came across the Pizza Fiesta on Penn Avenue and ended up ordering gyro platters. I was not impressed, to say the least. The fries were pretty meh, and the gyros were very cheaply & poorly made. It wasn't until a few weeks later that I discovered BFG Café on the same street...I would recommend getting your authentic homemade gyro there (and for only $5) instead of getting the super bland gyro at Pizza Fiesta."}
{"text":"Did the trick.  I wanted something small, and easy to purchase.  Pizza Fiesta didn't disappoint me.  My order was accurate, and it was available in virtually no wait time at all.  Like others have commented in their reviews, I was given a side of ranch dressing.  The ranch dressing made the leftover crust even better tasting than it already is."}
{"text":"Good food and fast service! Got a simple cheese pizza, delicious. Thin, crispy crust. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Classic pizza parlor. They serve an excellent pie and have an awesome college special. Was my go to when I went to school. Oh, and the ranch is killer."}
{"text":"Foods wack and over expensive compared to what you can get from other places. It was like eating bad bar food. It's extra-basic."}
{"text":"I ordered there supreme pizza. It took an hour to arrive. The delivery guy called and asked my address about 50 min in. He asked me if I could wait outside so he could find my place. Um no it's 10 degrees outside then he hung upon me. The pizza was cold and it wasnt the right pizza it was a taco pizza. Didnt bother calling back because I didnt want to wait another hour and then have to deal with that miserable delivery driver."}
{"text":"Great pizza crust, and love their onion rings. My go-to pizza is the special two-topping medium pizza. I order onion and sausage and ask them to make it a white pizza. I've never been disappointed. Solid four-star plus all the way. Delivery is fast and friendly. I like to order online to get the free delivery.  Update 9/6/13: I've ordered from Pizza Fiesta probably eight times since I posted my original review. Was disappointed once when their onion rings were overcooked, and once when their fries with cheese and bacon were overcooked, but I just added a note in subsequent online orders asking them not to overcook/bake, and the next order was fine. This place still gets two big thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"Pepperoni, Sausage, Ham, Salami, Capicola, and Bacon: Put them on a pizza and bear gustatory witness to the good things that happen inside the mouth when salty meats cavort with a tangy red sauce, creamy, tapered mozzarella, and a sturdy crust. Not that I haven't devoured even better Meat Lover's Pizzas, but this omnivore and his lady were considerably impressed with what we had delivered to us the other night (yeah, they cover Beechview!) by Downtown Pittsburgh's Pizza Fiesta.   Also had was a hulking half of a Santa Fe Chicken Hoagie. Shrouded in a toasted bun comes grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, the usual vegetables, and a \"Santa Fe sauce\" that I can only describe as a median between sugar and spice. Of course, I also had mayonnaise on the sandwich, so that may have clouded my palate a bit, but I'll say this: Subway has just gotten yet another inch of dirt shoveled onto its coffin.   For dessert were the adequate, not exactly spherical funnel cakes PF calls Sugar Balls, and while they were tasty in a naughty state fair kind of way, they could have lived up to their namesake a little more if they weren't so stingy with that powdered sugar dust.   Upon the conclusion of our meal, I came to a frightening realization: I'm running out of places to review that deliver to my neighborhood!  P.S. I don't know if PF makes their cheesecake in-house or just buys it elsewhere and resells it, but the slice I had for dessert was excellent."}
{"text":"A little slow on the cook but it has a nice location , and conveniently stays open later than other restaurants in the area. My fiancé and I really enjoyed the seafood pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza for a friends birthday and they refused to deliver in the bar because it is a gay bar. Homophobia in 2016 is ridiculous. I will never order there again and ask all i know to boycott."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza shop. They have great delivery service and delicious food. I love Buffalo chicken salad with homemade ranch!"}
{"text":"Pizza is okay. Delivered us our order tonight plus an extra pizza that wasn't ours. Did realize and didn't eat it. Called back they said they delivered it to the wrong house. No duh. Good thing I'm a nice person. Someone could have messed with that pizza. Poor ethics from pizza fiesta tonight. Feel bad for the people who ordered the buffalo chicken pizza. I would be angry if I found out someone else had my pizza before it was delivered to me."}
{"text":"I was trying to order online but after I hit the fifteenth page and they wanted even more information to start an account I gave up and called my order in.  There's no need to force someone to enter their email address and create an account just to order a pizza.  The breadsticks were a little overcooked and the bleu cheese dressing was in packet form so if you are hoping to get a container with chunks of bleu cheese in it, prepared to be disappointed.  Pizza was average but you need to let it cool off before you try to grab a slice or the cheese is going to slide right off of it.    Ordered the family feast (large plain pie, hoagie, breadsticks, two liter soda) and with tax and tip it came to $30.00.  They do charge a $1.00 delivery fee.  After the fiasco of trying to order online and the rather strange handling of the called in order I opted to pay with cash instead of using my debit or credit card.  I might order from here again; the cheeseburger hoagie was great and you actually tasted the meat but the bread needed to be cooked more.  They did get points for putting the lettuce and tomato on the side in a container and omitted the onions just as I requested.    There's nothing spectacular about the pizza but it arrived within 45 minutes and everything was correct."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised how great this place is. It's like a hidden gem I'd never paid attention to. They have an extensive menu but it's not too much. Some places have crazy menus that read like novels. It's nice to have a decent variety at a pizza shop. We had an Italian hoagie, gyro and fries. Really tasty with fresh ingredients. Specials are cheap and lots of food.  There's a small dining area that's decorated with black and white framed prints, modern tables and chairs and nice flooring. Staff are super friendly. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Literally the worst pizza experience ever. Order took over two hours and was provided 4 different explanations over the course of 6 phone calls by Josh from the penn ave location. Whenever a manager was requested it was repeated that one was not on site. After requesting a refund Josh stated he could not assist but later requested debit card information be written down and sent with the delivery driver. Josh also requested contact information for a call back which never occured. If you can avoid ordering by all means please do so!"}
{"text":"Ordered here a couple of times..  Wings- 3/5 not enough sauce on them Breadsticks - 2/5 would be better if their was garlic butter and parm on them, but I like how big the order is, other than that just plain cooked dough w/o any flavor Gyro - 4/5 honestly pretty damn good  Pizza - 5/5 no complaints  Service - 10/5 The girl who answers the phone and the driver that delivers are always friendly and prompt!  In reality I'd probably rate them 3/5 overall but it's the friendly & prompt service that's get the extra star. Will continue to order from just because of that."}
{"text":"Great pizza but not delivering to a \"Gay\" Establishment is very racist and the fact that 85% of your customers that come in on the weekends are homosexual so you have lost business and the world will know of this"}
{"text":"New pizza, burgers, gyros, and other comfort good spot opened about a year and a half about by a nice family from Kyrgyzstan. They have lunch specials and are one of the latest places still open of you're on Penn after a show, gallery opening during Unblurred, or other event. If you become a regular, they'll even occasionally share Boortsog and other Kyrgyzstan dishes that the staff each together with you :)"}
