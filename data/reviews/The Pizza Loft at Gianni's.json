{"text":"Me and a buddy asked the Embassy Suites for a good pizza place. They recommended Gianni's. Great choice.  The pizza loft is above the restaurant. You can choose one of the standard pizzas or build your own. Delicious thin crust and whole milk mozzarella. Sam was as pleasant as could be and she resembles Carla Gugino except Sam has blue eyes. Next time I  am back in town, I will definitely come by and enjoy a 14 inch pie."}
{"text":"The staff was super nice and delivery was quick. However for three large pizzas it was over $72. The pizzas were plain with no flavor. Looked beautiful but zero spice"}
{"text":"So, I can't recommend this place if you're looking for NY style pizza. It's not NY style and just average at best.   What I and more upset about is the Garlic Knots, they were literally dinner rolls (like you buy at the grocery store) dusted with butter and garlic. They were presented on a basket and not even hot. I'm not even sure what to write but I could have made them better at home. Come on, dinner rolls, really??!  On the positive, the place has a nice atmosphere and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"This place is a place you've got to try. First of all it's definitely my kind of place. It's located in downtown Concord. I mean if I grew up in Concord this is the area I would have hung out.  The Pizza Loft is on the second floor, above what appears to be a fine Italian Restaurant. We plan on trying it in the very near future. The Loft is exactly what a pizza place should be. The pizza is thin and well cooked. There is a wide variety of toppings.There are three sizes of pies 14\"-16\"-18\".  Don't expect anything fancy,paper plates,real silverware and plenty of napkins. The employees were very efficient and friendly. We even met Mario the pizza maker. I rarely give a 5 star so the 4 stars is a great rating."}
{"text":"Ya'll - I don't understand how this place has no reviews, their pizza is SOOOO GOOD. I've been here twice, once I ate in and once I did carry out. Dining in was my first experience and I thought my friend was crazy as we trudged through Gianni's to the back stairs and up to the loft. The place was BUSY so we sat at the little bar which was cozy and welcoming. They also had a private party in the little room off of the main area and it seemed they didn't have enough staff to keep up with that, the phone constantly ringing for takeout, and the folks there at the other tables. Anyway - we got the Hawaiian which isn't your typical ham and pineapple, oh no, they too theirs with hot cappacola, spinach, ricotta and pineapple. SO YUMMY especially on their crunchy crust. The next time, I ordered out one Hawaiian and one Margherita and both were just as delicious. This will definitely be my go to locale in the future - thank goodness I live close to downtown Concord!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Concord hands down. Great atmosphere and a great area downtown Concord. Always busy for a reason!!!!!"}
