{"text":"Four in our party. Every meal delicious! Best chicken melt sandwich ever, pastrami sandwich tender, lean and delicious. Fish fry very good & French dip good as well. We'll be back (often)."}
{"text":"This is the best cafe we have been too in the 2 yrs we have lived in Mesa.  Just recently went for breakfast and then for the fish fry.  For the two meals we had I don't think there is anyone that can beat the quality and service.  For breakfast we both had the \"piggy omelette\".  This puppy is packed with meat, very good favor, and it is a large one.  They have one of my favorite - raison toast!  It comes with a much lower price than other comparable places and great service.  We went this past Friday for the all you can eat fish fry.  It was only $8.95, comes with soup or salad, potato and veggie.  First off, the fish is Cod and you have the option of fried, baked or a combo of both.  We opted for the fried and it was the best cod we have had since being out here.  Nice fillets and lightly breaded it was very good.  The first order was so large that we did not need to request additional fish.  Another thing I liked was at most fish fry's, they serve it with french fries only.  Here one has a nubmer of side options.  I asked if the soup was homemade and they assured me it was.  I had the clam chowder (New England) and it was very interesting.  It had a strong favor of I believe tarragon which I found unusual.  It also had alot of clams and some pretty large ones at that - definitely homemade.    Overall great prices, prompt service, friendly service and a clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is cheap as all get out. The server we had was great! I didn't particularly care for the food but its cheap and has a home town feeling."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price! The service is fantastic as well. Came here three days in a row and loved it each time :)"}
{"text":"Since Jackie had been gone service has been unpleasant.   I had patty and got food and that was it.   Needed refill on soda I had to go find her.   Just not the same without Jackie.  I really wish I could find her.   We probably won't be returning.   Also I find it rude WHEN they speak Spanish in front of the customers.   The fish fry has even got really bad"}
{"text":"I LOVE IT!!!  they were nice !!!  Zoe  Above is the glowing review of an 8 year old connoisseur!  Seriously we have been here twice in one week. Dinner and Breakfast. It's a good deal for the money. The staff is great, remembered us from our first visit. They treated Zoe like a special guest. We met one of the owners, he was great with the customers.   We plan on going back often to support this local business. This is the 3rd restaurant I have seen in this spot I hope this one makes it.  Seriously the taco omelet was awesome and under $6.00!"}
{"text":"We've been here for dinner twice.  The first visit, they has just been open a short while, and the service and food were passable. The most recent visit, the service was extremely slow. There were three of us. Two of us received our food after a 20+ minute wait.  The waitress said the third order would be out right away - it came 15 minutes later and was so overdone as to be inedible.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"Stopped by here this week for a late afternoon lunch. From the time that I walked in the entire staff was as friendly and professional as they could be. I ordered a little bit of every type of food that was on the lunch menu. I couldn't have asked for better attention nor tastier, well prepared food. From the tomato juice, that was as tasty as it gets nowadays, to the homemade chicken with rice soup, which was served piping hot. I ordered a hot and cold sandwich, and both came out at the same time, which was fine with me. I started to eat the tuna melt sandwich first, which was on rye bread, and was as good as I've ever eaten. Both sandwiches came with a side of your choice, and I chose the coleslaw with one and cottage cheese with the other. Nice portions! And each came with a slice of dill pickle as well. I ate half of the hot sandwich, and satisfied that it was as good as I had imagined, I started in on the \"turkey stack\" cold sandwich. It was delicious! After I had finished, my plates were cleared in a timely, and my server brought the bill, which was more than reasonable for all that I had ordered. This place is GREAT! How can anyone call this food \"mediocre\"? I am NOT a \"plant\" here, believe me. But I will always give a glowing review to people who try hard to serve VERY good food at a reasonable price. It looks as though they have applied for a liquor license as well, and I hope that that adds to their bottom line. This is the same building that housed The Vine for a number of years, and they used to draw BIG crowds in their prime. Many to drink as well as eat. I certainly hope that that happens to these fine people. I'll be back VERY soon!"}
{"text":"Nice, clean ...good meal for breakfast. Is the remodeled vine tavern. I highly recomend this breakfast place...the service is great...and the food is good."}
{"text":"When I was served food was decent. The second time we were seated , but never approached. They have some serious staffing issues. I work in that plaza encounter many people  I will never recommend any one to go there."}
{"text":"I actually haven't been here for a while but I forgot to give it a review. Actually I have been here 4-5 times and tried several items from their menu. All in all again it is very basic breakfast food similar to the others I have tried in this area of Mesa. The items are alright, well done and I wonder if not a little processed but others are the same. The prices can't be beat and the hours are good and the menu has all your basic including some Gyros items too which is unusual and must be similar to the greek owned diners back in the midwest. The only thing I did not care for on the breakfast menu was their cinnamon roll, this thing was horrible and I would given them a 1 to 2 star alone for such an atrocity if it wasn't all the other items that saved them. I could only take 2 bites and realized that if I ate this I would surely be sick. My advice to them is to get rid of this thing off your menu. I could not believe some people ate the whole thing because their pictures are on the wall.  The only other complaint would be the place is dark because it is a bar so the ambiance is not so great but it is a lot newer than the other diners around the area so at least they have real tables and booths."}
{"text":"Great and attentive staff! Food comes out hot and full of flavor. I've tried breakfast lunch and dinner and they're all equally good!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here four times thinking it will get better. It didn't. I've had breakfast, lunch and dinner and they were all terrible with dinner as the worst.   I ordered liver and onions. The liver was too tough to eat and the onions were burned. I was served what looked like Libby's mixed vegetables and what I really believe were instant mashed potatoes. Everything on my plate was warm, not hot. It was too disgusting to eat.   My server came over and asked if I needed a box and if everything was all right. I said my eyes were bigger than my stomach and refused the box by saying that reheated  liver doesn't work.  The ONLY thing I've ordered and been happy with are the sweet potato fries.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"Breakfast with Mom.  Great food as always.  The wait staff was a bit off today, but it happens.  It is real busy for a Friday morning."}
{"text":"Three of us arrived at lunch time mid week and were greeted and seated quickly. The cafe was busy but not full and our waitress came to the table promptly, drinks followed very quickly as well. My two companions ordered burgers (1 was a cheeseburger), I ordered blueberry pancakes with a side of sausage. Food took a little longer to arrive than we expected but not excessively long. The blueberry pancakes (short stack) were the best I've ever had, absolutely loaded with blueberries. The sausage was very good, a bit spicy (my favorite) but if you prefer mild you might want to pass on the sausage. My companions said the burgers were excellent, clearly not previously frozen paddies but hand formed ground beef...they were \"medium\" as ordered and were juicy and not dry. The fries were just OK, we requested extra crispy but they were \"standard.\" everything was hot and was served as soon as it was ready. Beverages were refilled several times which reflected the attentive service. Everything served was \"large,\" no scrimping here and though full,  Having been impressed with the pancakes, I decided to try the homemade blueberry pie. Unfortunately the pie was served straight from the fridge...very cold, crust was not soggy but a bit tough, it was OK, but I wouldn't order it again. Overall, I give this restaurant high marks, we all agreed we'd return. Prices were very affordable and represented excellent value."}
{"text":"Food was ok for the choices.  No egg white offerings, no fruit instead of hash browns.   Yes, it was cheap, but that isn't our only criteria for a restaurant that we will return again.   Music was way to loud, service was so-so.  Food came out fast, but getting coffee refills was very slow.  Wait staff was upset to be asked to serve coffee to a table that wasn't 'theirs'.   We will probably not be back."}
{"text":"The salads were sufficient, but nothing special. We ordered of both breakfast and lunch menus. I would go with breakfast over lunch. The omlets were fluffy and large."}
{"text":"This place was horrible! Doesn't even deserve a star. There was only one waitress who was friendly and doing her best. We were there in the afternoon. It's not home cooking at all. I got a Reuben sandwich which was OK but there wasn't any meat on it to know that you had a sandwich .my father had a roast beef dinner and it was anything but roast beef so I'm kind of surprised meet it was absolutely horrid my friend that was with us had a roast beef open faced sandwich and it was the same thing as what my father ordered mystery meat drowned it in gravy that came for my can it looked absolutely disgusting and taste just like that actually my friend said can of Alpo tasted better we will never be back"}
{"text":"Talking about home cooking give this place a try. I'm 70 years old and I was definitely the youngest patron there. Food came out extremely quick even though they were busy. Was cooked perfect and served hot. Prices are very reasonable. Only reason not 5 star was coffee sucks."}
{"text":"Very clean and nice place to eat. Food is a hit or miss. Breakfast is good some mornings and the lunch is just not good. I ordered the chicken Alfredo for lunch and it was so gross. It tasted canned and had a horrible after taste. I have eaten here about 5 separate times but unfortunately won't be returning again."}
{"text":"I have been watching this place and noticed how busy it is.  Needless to say that it was swarming with snowbirds for the entire winter.  Now that they have all gone home, I gave it a try.  Lucky for me that I was served by Patty.  Food was good, place is clean.  I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a couple of years and really enjoy this place. The food is good. My husband and I usually come for breakfast.  I like the chicken omelet and the mini morning breakfast.  They are happy to make substitutions. The wait staff is very nice. Sometimes a little slow, but this place gets busy!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews I wanted to try this place. When you walk in, the first thing you see is a register/counter with a bar behind it. Weird, but ok. I noticed that the restaurant is cut in half- singles to the left, parties to the right. Kidding aside- I really did notice that I was sat on the left side, where all the other \"one tops\" were sat, while it seemed like parties of 2 or more were led to the right. Very odd,but may  have been uintentional. Waitress was very nice. I ordered a BLT with onion rings. OMG- this sandwich had more than enough bacon and lettuce it fell out of the bread! Hot bacon! Yay! Crispy like I asked for! Yay! Delicous! I also upgraded to onion rings as a previous reviewer advised- great call!! For $1.25 more I got a hefty order of hot onion rings, and a side of ranch (at no extra cost!)! The only strange thing for me was that even though my bread was toasted, it was soft. How does that happen? Not sure, but it was good. I was interested in a few other items on the menu, and will definately be back. $7.72 for a great sandwich and onion rings! Score!"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast today with friends. Food was pretty good but they are understaffed or need more kitchen staff. The waitress was good but it was slow."}
{"text":"I went there twice. One dine - in,one carry out both were excellent good food good service."}
{"text":"Food was good and prices were right, but the service was horrible. We waited 20min before getting up and asking for a server to take our drink order. Then another 25min for our food to come out. They even forgot to give us silverware. I would have given it one star but the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"This was the second time we ate there.  First time wasn't too bad.  I ordered a Jalapeno burger and was okay, nothing to write home about but decent.  This last time we went there though was terrible.  It was around 1 in the afternoon, so still lunch/brunch time.  When we walked through the door the place was totally empty, no guests, no employees.  I just figured hey, its summer time in east Mesa.  Waited a minute or so and someone came out from the kitchen area and seated us.  It was at this point when I asked about the specials that I saw on the board by the front door and our waitress said \"yeah, they're right there on the board\" (which was out of view of our table) and I was like...um okay... So anyhow, despite our less than hospitable waitress I ordered the special \"four cheese omelet\" and my wife ordered a taco salad.  Food came and I instantly regretted my decision.  Four cheese omelet was mostly cheese with some bacon bits shaken on top of it, the cheese on top wasn't even melted.  It was the worst omelet I have ever not been able to eat.  My wife's taco salad looked good, she said the shell was freshly made.  However the sour cream and guacamole that came with it looked spoiled so she didn't eat it for fear of getting food poisoning.  All in all due to poor service and less that stellar food we will not be going back to this location.  This really saddens me as I love patronizing local establishments.  Hopefully this place gets their act together or it will end up being vacant as the rest of the plaza it sits in.  (I added pictures the day we were there, just got around to writing this review though)"}
{"text":"Nice building lots of room with a bar thats nice. Menu is plain and average for alot of the cafe's I have visited nothing stood out as special or different prices were equal to others. The waitress was defanitly in a bad mood and not to friendly. I ordered a half lbs cheese burger med done and fries. The burger was cooked well and had more onions then lettuce lol not to bad to start but I went for the ketchup  and the lid was totally full of water I give them props for cleaning the lids but maybe make sure that they are dry before setting the table. Mostlikley not going to revisit since there was one waitress to the large restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is really cheap. We ordered spaghetti, chef salad and tuna melt. The sandwich was ok. The fries were just fine, but everything with lettuce was awful, the side salad looked like it had been in the walk-in with cellophane over it for three days.  I could see how brown the lettuce was before it even left the servers hands. Both salads had a bunch of water in the bottom of the dish too. Spaghetti had about a pound of mozzarella melted on top and also was swimming in clear liquid at the bottom of the plate.  Service was fine but the food... Meh. Sometimes you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place is weird. I come in the door and say \"table for 1\" and she replies \"I hope I can get someone to seat you\" ???? Then she stands there looking around until she see a waitress and tells her it's her turn to seat people.  I got an omelet and it would have been good except for the fact it had canned mushrooms. Really! Plate was a nice size, hash browns good, toast buttered just right. Coffee was pretty good. Prices great. Table service was friendly and fast.  Take my check to hostess to pay. She ignores me for a moment or two. She finally looks at me and I hand her my check. She says \"is this yours?\" - another weird moment. I tell her yes, she goes to ring it up, reads it first and asks if I ordered the Spanish omelet. I just gave her my card. So bizarre.  I would try here again because it has potential."}
{"text":"Unimpressed  I you're looking for cheap.bland food this is your spot  Came in for breakfast, probably won't be back"}
{"text":"We are still waiting.  We made a reservation for 12 and when we came in we were met with a sour look and they shoved some tables together to accommodate us. The waitress didn't get off on a good note with us either. Drinks came out slow or not at all. I must say though that the food was very good when we finally got it. It took over an hour to get our food."}
{"text":"Like the spacious and not crowded restaurant but once you have the food, you know why.  Big portions lacking flavor and the coffee was bad too!  Server was sweet and thoughtful.  Pulse they were out of kid menus"}
{"text":"Well this is our 2 new visit  here since 2014 just after they opened  the reason we're here is .... well it's Mother's Day the other three places we went were Jamed or closed ...... yes closed on Mother's Day .. we drove by ev cafe noticed they were open and no crowds . We walked in and we're seated promptly then waited for service took 5 minutes or so for the one crabby wait person to offer us a beverage and another 5 to finally take our order our wait person was a nice young gal she took our order I ordered my eggs poached one egg was fine the other had no yoke all white apparently broke in the water and instead of making me another egg the cook sent it out of the kitchen as is ..........my wife like her dish food was not bad .... the tvs were all in with no sound and no music at all .... just a very no aumbieance  at all ....."}
{"text":"Horrible simply horrible. Service sucked. I ordered the chicken parmesan special. It was disgusting and when I said the best we can do is take 10% off. BIG DEAL 77 CENTS OFF. THEY HAVE LOST MY BUSINESS. Plus the my soda was flat and when I asked to speak the manger she wouldn't even come out."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner. Being a cafe that's primary biz is breakfast an lunch so the rating I'd a 6 or 7 out of 10. The service was great, friendly and quick. Can't wait to try breakfast though, since that is there forte. Menu for all meals was broad without being to large, well thought out."}
{"text":"Food was decent and price was great however our server was extremely rude. As someone who has worked in service industry for 20 years there was no excusing her attitude."}
{"text":"This cafe has the cheapest prices on everything in their menu.  There is literally not one item more than $10.  I think that is what draws in all their current customers from Leisure World.   The service was just fine. Speedy and friendly, no complaints there.  However, I think you get what you pay for with the food.  I ordered the Gyro, my girlfriend the Greek salad.  Salad was just fine, fries are ok... But I'd pass on the Gyro.  The meat had this bologna texture to it that grossed me out.  Any American dish they do well, I just won't be ordering anything adventurous off their menu again.  BLTs and Cheeseburgers for me!  My boyfriend loves their French Dip.  This new place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place while in Mesa looking for a breakfast spot. As we walked in the host was holding the door open for a gentleman with a walker, always nice to see common curtesy. The waitress was also very nice and recommended the waffles.   Now for the food- coffee was ok; eggs were good, just needed a bit more salt and pepper; pancakes and the waffle were wonderful- light and very tasty. We also took home a cinnamon bun. Supposedly the largest in the valley. It looks good but not something for a single person. Actually if one person finishes it they get their picture on the wall"}
{"text":"Service: Lovely!  Prompt, friendly.  Atmosphere: Family diner/grill feel.  Fake flowers, wood accents, and lots of specials.  Food:  Snowbird food in general.  The top sirloin was one of the saddest plates I have ever seen.  It looked (and tasted) like a frozen meal.  Not gross, so sad.  The turkey bacon club was much better, but a scorched black  piece of toast was artfully hidden in the middle. Decent sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Busy with snowbirds in town but food is very good, service friendly. Prices are very reasonable. Have had the chicken soulvaki for lunch and gyros. Surprised both were very good. Ate breakfast there a few times and it was great."}
{"text":"Been coming here for cpl years service 5 stars easily very consistent too. Breakfast is hot, fast, and always what you were expecting. Value is incredible too I can eat here w hubby for less than $20 (usually) and boy can hubby put away the chow! Lol We always tip 20% bcuz the servers are great, polite, and on point! So try em if you're in the area support this local non-chain restaurant they work very hard I'd like to see em here 20+ years ... Or more ;-)"}
{"text":"A group of us has had breakfast here a few times. I thought it was okay the first time, but after that, the food and service declined. The service was extremely slow, and there were errors on the checks. The breakfast was only so-so, and the toast was cold. I asked for home fries, but got hash browns. Others in the party had the same problem. I won't go back."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic what a hidden gem! Got off work a little later than normal and made it in less than a hour before closing and everything was still fresh! The wait staff was courteous and professional and made us feel welcome. The decor inside was all done up for the approaching holiday. I can't think of anything bad to say about this place! I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I like that this place is so close to my work and that the staff is friendly.  What I love is how they cook their over easy eggs so nicely.  What I do not enjoy are their hash browns because it feels like it was tossed around in some oil heated up and thrown on a plate or container nicely.  Hash browns are perfect when they are crisp on at least one side with that golden buttery side that way when you place your over easy eggs on them they still have a nice crisp crunch with every bite.  The chicken fried steak was mediocre along with the giant not moist cinnamon roll they feature on the window. its got bits of apple and raisin if im not mistaken but the dough is just got like a stale dry taste to it regardless of it being warmed up.  Kind of a bummer but if im in a hurry and want eggs ill stop."}
{"text":"Long wait time for breakfast on a Friday at 10am (with only 8-10 tables full). The waitress was  nice, but the food overall was mediocre (I'd just as readily go to Dennys or IHOP). The bench seats were torn and it looked like it could use a deep cleaning.   On an upside, the biscuits and gravy were pretty good though."}
{"text":"This is a wholsome establishment that gives it's patrons more than they pay for with delicious quality food, great customer service and low prices! It's no surprise East Valley Cafe has been in business so long. I look forward to becoming a regular."}
{"text":"We just finished a nice meal. The place is full, service very quick. We'll come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch. Lots of empty booths and tables. The waitress was right there with drink orders and pointed out the daily specials board. We ordered the Philly Cheese-steak and I had the Pastrami on rye. Ml like the bun on her sandwich. My  Pastrami  has lettuce and tomato, which wasn't bad. The fries on her steak wasn't bad. My coleslaw was heavy on the mayo, but wasn't bad. Service was good. We are looking forward to try the All You Can Eat fish on Friday. This wouldn't be our first choice for lunch, but we will be there again to try the fiah."}
{"text":"This cafe has been a couple other places, I gave the new place a try and was very pleasantly surprised. It was a slow Monday night and the service was fast and I made several changes to my order which they accommodated nicely.The eggs benedict was great, I loved the hollandaise sauce and they added a grilled chicken breast to it and cheese covered hash browns.......A large portion at a very fair price, and they serve breakfast all day!"}
{"text":"Yes I work here.  East Valley Cafe has great prices and the food is good.  To top it off we enjoy our customers. We are getting our winter visitors back.  Boy there are many who I have missed.  Anyways come join our family for breakfast lunch or dinner..             Thank you. Jackie  ."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat.  We stopped here about 8:00 and there were a few patrons in the restaurant but not too many.  We were seated right away and the waitress was quick to ask about our order.  The food was excellent and prepared perfectly.  Prices were also very good. Matter of fact, I can't think of a single negative.    It was a great place to stop and we'll probably be doing it again."}
{"text":"I had a great meal with my son.  Good service,  friendly but steak could have been a little better.  On a scale of 1-10 I give it an 8"}
{"text":"Breakfast priorities:  Fast seating. Check Great coffee. Check Great omelette. Check Friendly staff. Check Great prices. Check  Passed with flying colors. It's breakfast. Don't make it complicated. Come here and check it out."}

{"text":"Very fast service. Ham breakfast very good. Home made hash browns. Coffee good too. Will return want to try fish fry next"}
{"text":"Right up the street from where I'm staying on my short visit to Mesa. Came recommended from hotel staff, so off I went in search of a good breakfast/brunch. I had me a skillet scramble that was THE BOMB! I also saw the extensive specials and menu they have going on for lunch and dinner...may just hit them up again. But, if you're in town or in the area, hit them up for some good eats.  Went back again this morning on 06/02, this is my go to breakfast spot."}
{"text":"This was my second visit on a Sunday morning.  Unfortunately, Sunday is not the day to visit this restaurant.  It was filled with every senior getting out of church.  When you arrive your suppose to sign your name in on a sign in sheet, however, there are no instructions to do this and we had a few people who \"knew the rules\" sign up ahead of us even though we were there earlier.  We finally sat at the bar to avoid the long wait.  It took about ten minutes before we were waited on.  Once the order was taken the food came out quickly.  The portions are large and the food is tasty.  Just be prepared for the large crowds on Sunday morning and remember to SIGN IN."}
