{"text":"Great place. Best hidden secret in Solon Ohio. The service and atmosphere are second to none. Happy Hour so good you would want it to never end. Russ is so courteous and pleasant. Makes great drinks. Every food item is tasty."}
{"text":"My wife and I had an extraordinary meal here on Saturday night. The chef actually came to our table to talk with me about how I wanted my steak cooked. The place is very nice very beautifully decorated it has a phenomenal menu with a great bar. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"What a great place! Love the decor', environment, menu & food. The staff was attentive & friendly, with no eye rolling or attitude when needing to modify orders (no grains, no nuts). I had the short rib tacos, my guest an amazing chicken sandwich that included fried brussels sprouts. Of special note- I don't normally eat potatoes, but the fries here are AMAZING! My guest insisted I try a couple & it was totally worth it. They were perfect. She pointed out they are like that consistently - yum! The menu includes fresh, local food with a variety of choices including vegan, vegetarian & omnivore - perfect for our diverse eating requirements. That's a big deal because our family has a hard time finding a place that has something for everyone.  While some may find it a bit pricey, this is a case of getting what you pay for - a high quality experience all around. Hoghly recommend & we'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and had a horrible experience both times.    The first time was was shortly after the restaurant opened.  I ordered the steak sandwich and it was just ok.  The meat was dry.  The biggest problem was my daughter ordered the chicken fingers (kids menu) and they came out completely burnt.  They immediately took them back and it took over 45min to get a replacement.  As a result, they took the order off the check and gave us a $25 gift card.  We chalked it up to new opening and decided to give them a second shot.    Last night we dined and the experience was a complete disaster.  First, they put us at the front of the restaurant and they have a fundamental problem where the servers need to walk all the way to the back to retrieve the order.  Our server was always behind since he was always walking back and forth to the kitchen which was far away.  They really need runners to deliver the food.  Here are the list of problems with the food:  1) We ordered vegetables as a side for our kids.  They came out very soon after we ordered with no plates.  It took another 20min to get any additional food.   2) My wife and I ordered salads to start.  They did not come out until the main course and they forgot about my salad. 3) I ordered the white pizza with arugula.  The pizza came out with spinach and it was cooked into the pizza.  Originally I thought they cooked the arugula into the pizza which would have been weird, but it was clarified after I asked that they screwed up and gave me spinach. 4) My wife's fries were way over salted and barely edible.   5) All of the pizzas had too much flour on the bottom making the crust very dry at the edges. 6) When I received the bill, the fee was ~$62.  When I got the credit card receipt back, they charged ~$70.  It took another 25min for them to sort out the bill.  It's sad to see another Solon restaurant failing miserably.  This place is a disaster and we really wanted it to be great."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in Solon!   Healthy options and haven't disappointed us yet.  Great salads too!"}
{"text":"This was the place my best friends took me for my birthday lunch.  When we walked in all of us were pleasantly surprised. The d√©cor was relaxing and homey.  Because we went at 1:30  we were between the lunch and dinner crowds so we were the only ones eating in, but a number of people did pick-up.  We had a lot of fun with the gentleman who served us.  He was funny but professional.  And we all agreed the food was delicious.  I haven't been in that part of Solon for awhile since I never get up that way, but this place may give me a reason to come back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and a delicious meal.  Got great service from Jeremy.    I had the roasted beet salad and the trout.  Great fresh ingredients. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"This spot is a hidden gem! Every time we go back it seems to get busier and busier. 56 Kitchen has fresh, quality food to offer. We love everything on their menu from the salads to the pizza to the burgers to the chicken and fish entrees. My only wish is that they eventually move into another location even though I love that they have given us all a reason to visit that particular strip mall. This spot will surprise you. Our fav place to eat in Solon."}
{"text":"Unique and yummy! Interesting options and quaint little venue. Owner is very nice and accessible."}
{"text":"Just finished up lunch and this place is a find!!  We will be back for dinner sometime soon.  The short rib tacos are phenomenal...see photo. And even if you're stuffed, you have to get dessert!  They also have a kids menu....I tasted the chicken tenders and burger my kids had and not the \"typical\".  Much higher quality.  You can tell everything is made fresh.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"A welcomed surprise in Solon!   Family went for dinner...My Salmon was crispy on the outside... warm and lite inside...Mmmmm.     Menu has contemporary spins on the familiar and offers a wide enough variety to please even my picky kids.  Also lots of vegan and gluten free options for those looking for that.  Cool art abounds.  Be sure to check out the doors on the back wall!  The place is fun and relaxing and not too loud like the bar that was here before.  There is a bar here too that welcomes counter service for food and lots of drink choices.    Tasted my son's four cheese Mac N Cheese.  In a word...WOW.  (He added chicken and Brussel Sprouts.)  Daughter's pizza was cheesy with a great crust.     We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food and wait staff get high marks.  Atmosphere was bright and trendy, but very loud."}
{"text":"Soooo awesome!  I love that there are so many healthy VEGAN options! The food is out-of-this-world! The atmosphere is great too. I love the dark wood, open kitchen, the layout with tables in front area and high-tops in the back.... It is, in my opinion, the best restaurant in Solon."}
{"text":"I was in the area on business travel and found this place on Yelp. Decent decor in an industrial-chic way. Service was friendly and prompt at the bar. I had the French Kiss salad, which was good, but made the mistake of adding the Mediterranean spiced salmon.  To me, the salmon looked and tasted like a breaded slab of cardboard."}
{"text":"Great great food! Portions aren't insanity large like everywhere also but instead it feels like good quality and like someone put an effort in to the menu and quality!"}
{"text":"Lots of really great food options for a variety of tastes and dietary restrictions. Not a cheap restaurant, but definitely worth it. Everything seemed reasonably priced for the portions. Good beer selection as well. Don't skip the risotto- it's worth it! Friendly staff and super quick service."}
{"text":"I recently visited with the Yelp Supper Club and we had about 10+ people in our group (great turn out). While Solon is a bit of a hike from Cleveland I love seeing other suburbs and trying new restaurants. This place is decorated in what I consider to be \"Trendy\". Not too modern but bright and clean enough to make me feel like I am about to have a great experience.   We had 2 servers for our table and thought they did a great job getting our food in a timely manner and checking in on us periodically. I ordered the Lovely Bird which is a chicken sandwich with Swiss, Lettuce, Tomato Jam and Brussels Sprouts. I thought it was divine! I love the idea of brussels sprouts on a sandwich! The fried tasted like Penn Station fries- definitely a A+ in my book!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out the first time, a salmon club without bacon and a salad. We got home and the salmon club had bacon on it and the salad came without the bagel (which it's supposed to come with). We called the manager, Ed, who quite reluctantly agreed to pick up the tab next time we got take out. The next time we ordered take out we got the same exact order. This time the salmon club came without fries. The sandwich looked like it had been hastily put together and the avacado garnish looked bad. Black spots, the type of avacado that would go right in the trash if you had it in your kitchen at home. I called Ed again who said he was sorry. Now, if it's my restaurant (or business of any kind), at this point I am going to make a real effort to get back in my customer's good graces. Instead of offering to comp another take out order, or even a dessert, he said \"We will try to put something in place so that doesn't happen again.\" Naturally, he now he has an angry couple of former customers who will go on the internet and write negative reviews and will tell their friends not to go there. Incidentally, the food was okay. Not bad, not great."}
{"text":"A great new restaurant in Solon, Ohio.  The decor is well done, the staff incredibly friendly and the food awesome.  Plenty of selections and variety to please everyone."}
{"text":"Omg! I LOVE this place! I stopped here with my mom for lunch bc we were in the neighborhood. We both had the French Kiss salad and it was really really good! The decor is awesome and very comfortable. Alana was our server. She was AWESOME!! She reminded me of my own daughter!!! Super sweet, upbeat and super helpful on recommending what was good on the menu. Only if all servers were this good! I can't thank her enough for making our experience for a quick lunch memorable!!! Thanks ALANA!! We will be back and hope to see u again!!"}
{"text":"Really don't understand the 4.5 star review avg for this place.  The food was not great.  The pizza was burned making the crust too hard/crunchy.  Shrimp and grits was way too saucy completely overpowering the grits and the garlic kale tasted gritty which tells me I was eating dirt along w my kale."}
{"text":"Fresh, wholesome, healthy ingredients expertly prepared and delivered to our table in a timely and service-oriented atmosphere. Really enjoyed sitting near the back and seeing all the comings and goings that went into preparing our delicious meal. Bar service was great too- the \"we all fall down\" was refreshing and unique."}
{"text":"This is my first time writing a review but I my husband and I were very disappointed in this restaurant.  We made reservations knowing the restaurant would be busy on a Saturday night.  We were seated at a tiny table literally next to two other tables.  It was like we were eating with strangers on either side of us.  We could hear each other's conversations and the other couples seemed to be as uncomfortable as we were.  The server could not even get to either side of the table because there was not room.  The restaurant should rearrange their seating and quit trying to cram as many people in as possible, this is what reservations are for or so I thought."}
{"text":"We went here late on a Saturday night and had a good experience. Our waitress was fantastic. Super knowledgeable and sweet. I tried the 56 French and Bees Knees cocktails. Both were great. Not too sweet, but the clear winner was the Bees Knees. Gin, lemon, rosemary. Just clean tasting and delicious. Salad was good (as was the accompanying bread). My only complaint is the very small portion of chicken added to the salad. Maybe a third to a half of a breast was all that was added. My husband got the traditional burger which was good, but over cooked. Overall, we'll give it another try. The ambiance is good and we are looking forward to going back for live music on Thursdays."}
{"text":"Flirted with giving this two stars, but that's a pretty damning rating for what might have just been an off night...  New to the East side, and so we don't know many of these hidden gems, but me and the fiance met her friend for drinks here and ended up getting some things to nibble.   First off, service was pretty slow, which was unusual because the restaurant is pretty small and galley style. You would think it would be easy for servers to routinely hit up tables as you pass by.   The fiance ordered the Quinoa Salad, and said it was pretty good, but dry. I wasn't too hungry and so I simply ordered the Bruchetta 3-way which came with burnt crostinis. And I ordered a side of fries, which were either hard or chewy.  The friend ordered the macaroni & cheese, and added chicken and bacon (her usual order) and liked it.    Can't remember the last time I thought to myself- \"Huh... they failed at fries...\" So, like I said- two stars. But, the decor was good, it was a good place to have a conversation, and I might be back to try more expensive fare, but-... ah... the fry thing... yeeesh... I dunno, man..."}
{"text":"First visit to this establishment. Had a new waitress Alana - she was great too bad the food wasn't as good as she was. Ordered large Epresso pizza (sausage and pepperoni). Nothing worse than a greasy, soggy pie. Wife had sandwich with soggy fries.  Caesar and caprese salads were decent. Will not return to this place anytime soon."}
{"text":"Excellent addition to Solon.  Stopped in on a weeknight fairly early and restaurant was already full and there was a wait by the time we left. Next time I'll opt for a reservation. We started with the warm burrata served with crisp toast and it was fantastic. Great flavor from the red sauce it was baked in so overall, melty perfection! So may other appetizers we could have tried as well. We ordered a BELT pizza which was great. Thin, slightly charred bottom was a good sign even before the first bite. Also ordered the salmon club on masa waffle in place of focaccia bread. It was delicious and perfectly cooked.  Decor is modern and welcoming and will be a great place to dine with friends & family. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's new. Great menu and environment.  Only down side was food was extremely slow.  They are definitely experiencing volume vs speed prep issues.  I guess that's a good problem to have"}
{"text":"Searched for something different this evening for dinner since I was traveling. Looking over the selections on YELP I came across 56 Kitchen which caught my eye.  I was greeted timely and was waited on within a few moments. The only downfall would be the ease of the menu. It was hard to dissect what you were ordering.  I decided on the wings confit for an appetizer and the a piedi nudi pizza. Not we're superb and above expectations and can't wait to come back.  The wings were complex and left a little burn to remind you of them.  Service was great"}
{"text":"We had the White Shrimp Pizza (gluten free for us) and the French Kiss Salad! Also had a Pear Sangria and grabbed a Veggie Burger to go! Great ambience and the staff was fantastic! So glad we made the trip over here!"}
{"text":"Finally a good place in Solon, you don't realize you are at a strip mall, great vibe inside, daughter had the mahi special , she loved it. I had vegan meatballs with zucchini noodles great.. Russ was entertaining.  Will def return and hope the locals support this place"}
{"text":"So this would have been a 5 star review except for a couple things which made the entire experience less than ideal.  I even thought about giving a 3 star review, but ultimately I don't think that they deserve that.  As it stands I enjoyed the place but don't think that I'd go out of my way to come here again.  My wife and I came last night, in a bit of a rush because we were trying to catch a showing of a movie later on that evening.  56 Kitchen is located in a strip mall with plenty of parking, which is nice.  The decor is kind of rustic/industrial.  Very cool- especially the door montage at the back of the restaurant.  There was a happy hour being advertised and I was curious what it was, but the waiter didn't tell us and when I asked about it, he wasn't really sure about the specifics.  That left a weird taste in my mouth, even if I wasn't going to order off the happy hour menu anyways.  I ordered a Siesta Tequila.  Don't normally order mixed drinks because I'm cheap and I personally don't that they are worth the money, but what the heck, I figured out already out in Solon- why not.  It was ok.  Certainly didn't cheap out on the alcohol- I was feeling at by the time I finished, but it was more strong than delicious.  Could have used more lime.  For our meal, we ordered the Salmon club sandwich, a BELT pizza and fried artichoke hearts.  All in all, they were quite good.  The pizza had a wonderful crust and a tasty sauce.  The portions of bacon were pretty small, and a fair amount of bites had none in or- or egg for that matter.  Hard to eat because the greens were piled fairly high on it.  Tasted good though- I'd order again.  Our waiter didn't ask how we wanted the salmon cooked, despite what the menu ordered.  We would have probably asked for ours to be cooked a little more rare, though it wasn't callously overcooked.  The club sandwich was ok.  I probably wouldn't order it again, although the fries were delicious.  Fried artichoke was a revelation- I really enjoyed it a lot.  Crispy quarters of artichoke hearts with a light breading and a tasty dipping sauce.  Very interesting and delicious.  Generally speaking, the food came out quickly.  What annoyed me happened next.  We were running close to when the movie started, so I asked for a Peach cobbler to go and for the check, with my credit card ready.  Our waiter said sure went to put the order in, coming back to say, \"Well, the ice cream on the cobbler might not keep well in a take out container.\" so I was like, \"Great, I didn't know there was ice cream- can you just bring it out separately?\"  He brought out a bowl of vanilla ice cream for us.  Excitedly, we dug in- who doesn't love unexpectedly free ice cream?  Us, evidently, because this was definitely one of the worst ice creams I've ever had.  It tasted of the worst of the cheap supermarket ice cream- the super airy kind, with no depth of flavor and was chunky with crunchy ice particles and to boot was partially melted.  Ugh.  I couldn't finish it.  Not worth the calories.  But hey, it was free right?  I couldn't complain because I hadn't expected to get ice cream anyways.   But here's the kicker- when I looked at the receipt, there was a charge for $2 for the ice cream.  Now $2 is not a lot of money.  Had it been decent ice cream, I might have been more ok with it.  BUT, to have it implied that it was included on the cobbler dish when it is an extra charge, and then to have been served half melted, crappy cheap grocery store ice cream in a restaurant of this caliber is a bit much.  For the record, a waitress brought our cobbler out in cool cast iron pan, which would have been pretty sweet had we not asked for our food to go because we were in a big rush.  Fortunately our waiter caught her before she gave our food to us.  In the end, it was a decent place.  If I was in Solon, I'd go more often.  Since its a bit of a trip for me, I doubt I'll go again unless I'm in the Solon area.  Good food, but terrible terrible ice cream- hope they get a better supplier."}
{"text":"Service was great!   The owners are always there and make sure the experience is amazing.  Tons of vegan options, in addition to gluten free.   Staff is willing to help and recommend any options to fit your dietary restrictions.  I love the oyster mushroom sandwich (vegan) and the fries and the best in town!"}
{"text":"Best salads in town and could not ask for better kinder service!  Kudos to the staff and owners who go out of there way to serve a most delicious salad.  Dressing should be famous."}
{"text":"The vegetarian and vegan options here were all home runs. Everything I tried was fantastic - the Portuguese white bean & kale soup, the roasted eggplant with tahini, the Brussels sprouts and the a piedi nudi pizza were delicious. My main entree was the oyster mushroom steak sandwich and it really exceeded my expectations. If I had one nit to pick, it'd be that the cumulative flavor profile I experienced was a little on the salty side, but it was still very savory and delicious overall. Nice atmosphere, attentive servers, the whole package...this place is a gem."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot for higher end casual dining.  The decor is unassuming with plenty of functional art.  Very pleasing; easy on the eye.  Now onto the food.  My lovely Cindy and I split the Menage Aux Trois.  A dream come true!!  Delicious! I enjoyed the tomato soup which tasted like it was made just for me.  Heavenly!  As my main course I had the Farmhouse Burger with fries.  This burger is OFF THE CHART!  We will be back FOR SURE!!"}
{"text":"Nice place! Nice ambience, good food, good drinks, good service. Food is good quality for the price, but i do think we paid a little too much for mac and cheese and burgers. But the drinks were great! We went for happy hour but none of the drinks we ordered fell on the list so we paid full price. And we got a hummus plate as an appetizer with pita bread and toasted sour-doe for $3 and it was enough for four of us! And we were pretty hungry! They have a huge wine selection and their mixed drinks were really good as well.   Our waitress was very friendly, recommended some drinks and checked on us a lot. My friend had a small fly get into her drink as we were finishing up and the waitress took the drink off her bill which I thought was very considerate. We left her a generous tip :)   Nice location for the place too, right in Solon circle. We went at 3:30pm and it wasn't too busy. We left around 5p and it picked up a little so I would check google or something to see the wait time before you leave if you go in the evening. It looks small on the outside but there is plenty of space inside."}
{"text":"Decent food and great, friendly staff - but I must admit I wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be.  The salads were very fresh and I like the ambiance, so I think this place has a lot of potential, especially with such a great Solon location.  However, the flavors just didn't quite stand out on its own for me.  It felt like a decent sandwich, a decent mac and cheese and a decent appetizer, for downtown prices.  I do like the fact they offer to serve sandwiches on a masa waffle though.  I saw a couple of tables get the pizzas and salads, so perhaps that's the secret.  Overall, a bit pricey for the food, which I wouldn't mind paying for a wow factor."}
{"text":"The appetizer and drinks were good.  I was disappointed and slightly frightened by our dinners because the meat smelled odd.  I'd go back again for the drinks though!"}
{"text":"Really delicious food. The prices are quite high but I think the food definitely is worth the money. Their pizza is the best thing on the menu for sure. I had a burger the last time I was there and it was one of the best burgers I had in a long time."}
{"text":"Foods pretty good a little pricy but not bad. I would recommend this to older families with older kids. Overall very good resteraunt"}
{"text":"Vegans Be excited. High quality yummy food in a great atmosphere which thoughtful pleasant staff. Finally a place that gets it. People don't eat all the same and more and more are eating vegan or need to avoid certain foods. Just had the best vegan pizza ever"}
{"text":"Great first experience at 56 Kitchen. Service was friendly and quick, nice casual atmosphere, and most importantly for me, multiple vegetarian/vegan dishes. Husband had the farmhouse burger and was impressed. I opted for the veggie burger - with a tofu aioli - awesome! At the end of our meal, our server was on top of it and recommended a vegan dessert for me and a traditional dessert for the husband. Looking forward to trying their other vegan options!"}
{"text":"I ordered the goat and fig salad, tomato soup, and side of potatoes. The salad was just ok, but the tomato soup was extremely oily and bland. The potatoes were nothing to write home about either. I won't be returning here :("}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant...Wonderful sevice...Awesome food!  You have to try it!  I truly enjoyed my food and service.  Kudos"}
{"text":"Limited menu, prices a little high for a salad, but it is a very large salad, service very good, place is on the dark side"}
{"text":"Went to 56 Kitchen to celebrate my wife's birthday-the food was excellent. The service was phenomenal. The restaurant decor is beautiful. As an added bonus-there was live music-which you guessed it-was great! My family loved my choice."}
{"text":"Great new place in Solon! Crispy artichokes should not be missed. We ate at the bar and had excellent service. This will be a regular for us! Welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We started with two salads:  Spinach for me and French Kiss for Kelly.  Both were great.  Our wood fired pepperoni, mushroom, and onion pizza was excellent. Love the handmade thin crust.  Jeremy provided excellent service for our meal."}
{"text":"Our group tried several of the dishes on the menu and they were exceptionally prepared well-presented and served by a very attentive staff. I love the variety on the menu of all scratch-made items with Incredible flavor.  I'm in love with the blue cheese gnocchi!!!"}
{"text":"The new Tuna entree with forbidden rice, bok choy in a curry coconut sauce ... heaven on a plate!  I'll say it again Drew is awesome, this place is a great restaurant.  I mean who in Cleveland is putting cranberries in forbidden rice.  Very creative cuisine.  This place is 5 star. Drew is awesome chef ... very inventive and always tasty.  Russell man's the bar and knows his stuff big time.  Love this place and worth the trip to Solon!"}
{"text":"My work team picked this place for lunch today. What a great choice!  Our server was awesome. The food was very tasty and their homemade donuts for dessert was awesome. We had a variety of dishes and everyone enjoyed their meals. Caitlin was very attentive and a joy!!  This little joint is a must visit."}
{"text":"Pricey but worth it! My friend and I both ordered the farmhouse burger and it was fantastic! I don't like to exaggerate reviews but I am confident that is a word that anyone who consumes that burger would agree with. Absolutely worth the money. We also tried the pear and goat cheese cheesecake, if you pick this dessert for the pear then you may be disappointed, to be honest. I did not feel I could taste pear at all but I was still pleased. The crust was to die for and the fruit topping was very fresh! Borderline enough for two but a decent size for an okay price, worth adding to your m"}
{"text":"Wow, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I really enjoyed my meal here.  I had been to this location, under different ownership, but this was my first time since it's been 56 Kitchen. Based on Yelp suggestions, I did make a reservation for a Friday evening, and I was glad that I did because the place was packed.  My friend and I arrived and we were seated just a few minutes later.  I proceeded to order the Pear Sangria, Kale Salad and Trout Entr√©e.  The sangria and salad arrived first.  The salad was huge ($10), lots of kale, ribbons of butternut squash and carrots, nice touch, cranberries, nuts and a maple vinaigrette. The only downside to the salad was the kale leaves were way too big, would have been nice had the leaves been chopped slightly.  The entr√©e arrived a short time later, deliciously seasoned trout, on a bed of perfectly cooked brussel sprouts and farro side dish.  The portion was more than adequate and the price was right.  There were quite a few dessert choices, mostly cheesecake, but I was too full from my meal.  Next time:-)"}
{"text":"Mac n cheese is pretty good but I was pleasantly surprised with the open faces salmon BLT (I got without bacon). Nice sides to choose from and our waitress was knowledgeable. People kept ordering pizza and even kept seeing boxes of it being ordered to go, so that must be pretty good too? Will have to try next time. :)"}
{"text":"Came here a few times while on two separate, extended business trips.  The salmon was excellent, the turkey sandwich was great too.  The cheesecake desserts are some of the best I've ever had. The donuts were outstanding as well.  Ive been here about 5 or 6 times, and havent had a bad dish or experience yet.  The always friendly waitresses and staff even remembered my name after I left the area for a few months.  Its the little details like that which impressed me even more. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with a modern look and some homelike accents.  The service was very attentive and efficient.  I had the pumpkin soup which was a little too much on the sweet side for me, but it was house made and fresh.  The burger was excellent.  I had them substitute white cheddar for the smoked mozzarella and requested that they cook it on the flat top instead of the open flame grill which they were happy to do.  Excellent  taste and quality of the beef.  We'll try it again for dinner soon."}
{"text":"This was a fabulous dinner.  We went in a Thursday night, after traveling 9 hrs and were looking for a local restaurant with good  food and comfortable atmosphere. 46 Kitchen met all these expectations. The foods was Reaaly great.  We shared a small plate goat  cheese tart  (delish) and  were pleasantly surprised at the amount of freshly dressed greens that accompanied  it. For entrees the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich with fries was ordered ..it was an original twist, great taste, with the seasoning if the meat, which was very tender and juicy as well. It wasn't busy, but it was after 8pm and a weeknight. Decor was ok, felt a little sparse, but probably just because it was not a busy time. Loved the old doors on the wall at the back of the bar area. Had a great waitress and enjoyed both meals and drinks."}
{"text":"Had a great time here with the Cleveland Supper Club. We had a large group and they staffed us well and were able to accommodate easily. The owners came over to ensure we were enjoying ourselves and were open to answering questions from patrons. Loved hearing their story about where the name came from and how they got here. Our server had opinions and suggestions which I ALWAYS love and she went the extra mile by offering a tasting to make sure we liked the wine. Decor is beautiful and simple. Love how they lightened up the place and added sleek decor with a wall of doors, and metal work. Lots of seating that surprisingly doesn't feel cramped in the long layout.  Food was fresh and fun. They were passionate about their items and have a good diverse menu. We ordered bruschetta 3 ways-different than usual and appreciated. Salmon club-unique and cooked how ordered. French kiss Salad-fresh ingredients, would have liked more berries/toppings for price. Steak sandwich-Good, could use some sort of sauce, fries great.   Bottom line: going to come back, so much I want to try. Beautiful place for a date, friends, or to bring people visiting the area. A little expensive for me to be a regular, but food is worth it. I hope they stay here, Solon needs this place!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service and good atmosphere. Oh yeah and good Bread Pudding"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place.  The menu is inventive, the decor is very modern and attractive and the food was good.  But.  The experience was seriously overshadowed by service issues.  I don't mind a relaxed dining pace, but 2 hours for entrees and 2 drinks?  No appetizers, no dessert, no coffee, just 2 drinks and 1 plate of food.    It seems especially delayed when I waited at least 20 minutes for them to bring the first drink.    I had ordered a glass of the Sauvignon Blanc.  Waitress seemed confused so I showed her the line from the menu.  When she returned 10 minutes later, she was holding a glass of red wine.  I told her no, that must be Cabernet Sauvignon and that's not what I ordered,  she leaves.  Another 10 minutes passes and then another staff member tries AGAIN to give me a glass of red wine.  I again explain that this is not what I ordered.  So more waiting.  10 more minutes pass and then I get what I have ordered.    As it took 50 minutes in total to get our single course, I ended up ordering a second glass of wine, which was followed by another 20 minute wait.  Only then to be told that they were out of the Sauvignon Blanc.  Which happens, but it took 20 minutes in a small restaurant to figure that out and communicate it to the customer?  And I would've been more cheerful about that had I not also been 10 minutes without water while I waited, So, no wine, no water and the food has arrived.    My dining companion was served 2 different sizes of beers with no explanation or consultation and then was charged for the large for both drinks, which was not accurate.  And again, there was no communication.  The overall impression was of poor service and/or poor beverage training.  There are so many places to go in Solon/Chagrin/Hudson/Aurora/Twinsburg, I doubt I'd put myself through dealing with the poor service again."}
{"text":"The last time I was here it was June, 2014 and this space was occupied by a restaurant called The Tavern of Solon. It was not good and it is no more. Filling the space left vacant by the previous tenant is 56 Kitchen, a new American bistro that opened late spring 2016 with a focus on responsibly-sourced grub made from scratch. To nutshell it, I'd say it's a very good eatery with a comfy, welcoming vibe that has the potential to be great. Allow me to expound on our recent Wednesday evening experience.  The first thing I noticed upon entering the restaurant is the restaurant itself. I know, big surprise. I guess what I'm saying is that most places are just \"there\" without much personality. Here at 56 Kitchen it really is a well-designed and beautiful space. It oozes attention to detail and a warm sort of rustic urban comfort. The main seating area occupies the majority of the restaurant with the bar and open kitchen toward the back.   Reclaimed wood is in abundance, accents of exposed brick, and as others have mentioned, a really cool wall of doors toward to rear. The somber lighting adds to the cozy ambiance and the spotlights on some of the tables are sure to make Yelpy foodie photogs happy. If I had a small gripe it would be that the unpadded metal chairs weren't all the comfortable after about 45 minutes.  The service we received was excellent. We were immediately greeted when we walked in and immediately seated. Our server was pleasant, very knowledgeable and attentive in just the right amounts. Hell, her smile even seemed genuine. We were also waffling on a few dinner choices and she immediately had suggestions at the ready to break the ties. Waters were brought without having to ask - always a welcome touch - and empty plates were cleared in a timely fashion.  The adult beverages span the gamut from wine to specialty cocktails and back around to beer. Speaking of beer, they've got 10 draught selections that feature a few locals for good measure along with a handful of bottled selections that's not worth mentioning. The menu is nicely organized in several sections that include Small Plates, Salads, Pizzas, Sandwiches, and (larger) Plates. Everything reads like a little culinary story with each chapter a tasty little novella just waiting to be read, er, munched. I have a feeling you'll have a tough time deciding just as we did, so be sure to ask your server for help. That's why they're there, right?  We started our meal with a couple of salads. Here's a suggestion. Get one salad and share it. They're definitely on the large side and it'll save you about $10. My wife had the French Kiss and I opted for the less fruity Spinach. Both salads were tasty, made with plenty of fresh ingredients and weren't lacking for dressing. I actually thought they were a bit over dressed. I also wasn't expecting the crouton on my salad to be a large piece of unseasoned toast that I had to break apart myself. Minor issues, really.  Next we had the goat cheese and date tart/pastry. Probably the biggest disappointment for me foodwise. What you actually get is a plate that looks like a salad. The puff pastry is completely buried underneath a large mound of dressed greens. Turns out this is a puff pastry, served cold, schmeared with herbed goat cheese and topped with caramelized onions. I think the dates were in the salad part of this dish, but I don't remember tasting them. It was quite dry and flavorless. No golden brown, buttery goodness to be found. Just sort of blah.  For our main courses I had the Spice Crusted Pork Tenderloin and the wife the Salmon Club Sandwich. The tenderloin was done a mid-rare, just a bit pinker than I like my pork, but it was seasoned well and quite tender. I wasn't a big fan of the mushroom/garlic/kale/polenta. The mushrooms were a bit on the tough side and overall it lacked seasoning. The \"tomato caramel\" on the plate was like low viscosity ketchup that added a nice bit of acid.  The sandwich was served open-faced (also not expected and also makes it not a sandwich). The salmon was cooked well, just as ordered, the avocado was the perfect ripeness and the oven-roasted tomatoes added just the right amount of punch to cut through the fatty fish and unctuous garlic aioli. My wife found it pretty damn tasty. Oh, and the fries that came with it were perfect. Could use some malt vinegar mayo, though.  We made it to dessert and went for the donut holes. Five fried balls of crispy on the outside gooey on the inside deliciousness served atop a little river of fruity/chocolaty sauce. It's fried dough, how could you go wrong? Just sweet enough and a great end to the dinner.  So there you have it. We enjoyed our dinner at 56 Kitchen, it just wasn't great, specifically when it came to the food. It was so close, though. Just a few minor tweaks, some more seasoning, and I think they'll get there. Maybe we'll give them a few more months before we return, just so they can get their sea legs."}
{"text":"56 Kitchen is a great place for lunch, especially if you work near by. The service is usually pretty decent, menu choices are unique, and the atmosphere is open and spacious. Note, take a look at the far back wall! You won't be disappointed!   I had lunch here on two different occasions and both times were great! I recommend to try this place if you don't have a limited lunch time as it can be busy and your food may come out a little slower! I had the French Kiss salad the first time and it was bigger than I imagined. The second time around, I had the Trio Sampler which was awesome because you were able to try a small sandwich, salad, and their amazing french fries!  Definitely should try this local place if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time here for happy hour.  The HH menu has changed a bit since we last came, which I think is nice.  Items outside of happy hour are a bit pricey, but the quality is pretty good at least.  Our server (I think her name was Leah) was great."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Service was pretty slow, which I am not  sure why, because there were barely any people there, but the pizza was so good, it definitely made up for it. Not sure what else to say, but great restaurant all around"}
{"text":"I was searching all over the area for a gluten free AND vegan pizza crust. Yours is delicious. Thanks!"}
{"text":"A nice menu selection and deliciously prepared. Casual atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm impressed. 56 Kitchen was awesome. We came for lunch with my family. My husband is gluten free and the masa waffle with the burgers was delicious. We also had fish tacos, short rib tacos and soup and sandwich. The tomato soup was fresh and sweet and the hand cut fries were salty and crisp. You could taste the freshness throughout the meal. I'm not sure there is any place that even compares in Solon. We live in DC and 56 Kitchen would fit right in. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Greatest food I've had in a long time. I went here with my friend for lunch. We had great service and amazing food. Huge selections of drinks and really interesting menu items. The environment is great and it is really a hidden gem. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food and service. We finally had the pizza this trip and loved it. Their dessert are great and sandwiches also.  We have been there four times and twice we ordered the specials and they were okay. We suggest ordering off the menu... you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night after finding it on yelp! Very good restaurant! The decor was so nice, you would never know you're in a strip mall! Food was amazing! My husband had the pork chop which was delicious and I had shrimp and grits! Pizzas looked really good! We will be back to try the burgers and the pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"Very different, but very good food. Some interesting options for gluten-free and dairy free. No desserts that would accommodate my allergies, but the food was good and I would go back. Terry D. - Bloomingdale, OH"}
{"text":"It's casual dining at its best.  The pizza was for real, the dough is very good. Now it was late when we were there so I can't say not to order the Brussel sprouts but hey were dry and had little flavor.  I ordered the beet salad, it was a healthy size portion and the dressing complemented the spinach and beets well.   Tomato soup had a lot of spice and my friend loved it. The waiters here are casual yet professional and really do try. I truly appreciate this. Love the menu I will return."}
{"text":"Great place in Solon!  The food and drink menus are excellent with something tasty for everyone, from carnivores to vegans.  The bread pudding, caramelized in their pizza oven, is the perfect finish"}
{"text":"Dear God... this place has vegan cheese now.  I love this little restaurant particularly because it has so many healthy food options that taste wonderful!  We tried it out because it was right next to the gym we go to (planet fitness) and it's so nice to have a spot to eat healthy tasty food after a workout.  Their salads are a wonderful complementary blend of carefully articulated ingredients that go so well together.  They make pizza as well, which I recently had with their new vegan cheese and it just keeps getting easier and easier to stick to my new vegan diet because of this restaurant's delicious options! We love it!  Also have a good selection of vegetarian items. Haven't had anything here we didn't like."}
{"text":"Came because of the great reviews for the place.  Impressions: PROS: - Appetizer Wings Confit was amazing!  - Clean bathrooms - Nice decor for a date or family night  CONS: - Sticky floor, sticky tables.  - Service was blunt - not rude, but not friendly either. - Our waitress was nice but sort of offputting and artificial in behavior. - Main course was absolutely not impressive. I had the Vegan Meatball/Spaghetti dish and it was not really appetizing at all. The Beef short ribs with mashed potatoes was also bland and oily.  Conclusion: We definitely won't be back, but if you want to try a new restaurant, give it a chance, you may or may not like it."}
{"text":"Had the salmon sandwich and it was delicious! The decor was really charming and the waitress was super nice."}
{"text":"Not the best experience but worth a second trip. The atmosphere in there restaurant was very cool and the staff were pleasant and helpful. I ordered a specialty burger but received their house cheeseburger. I did not mention it to my server and was charged the appropriate amount for what they served me. The burger was fine but overcooked. My wife ordered a salad and enjoyed it but the serving of protein was a little small. She loved her cocktail though and they had a nice rotating tap list! Even though my meal wasn't the best, I plan on going back to try them again."}
{"text":"What can be more said. Great salads great pizza. The only part that needs improvement is the serving staff. Just the sign of the times no one has good service anymore."}
{"text":"The service was slow, however the food was yummy! My husband ordered the pork chop special and I had the salmon club. The salmon, a generous potion cooked perfectly, sat atop focaccia bread with avocado, tomato, aioli, and bacon. The highlight of this meal was definitely the donuts!"}
{"text":"Great place for a night out. Food was excellent. Mellow ambiance and atmosphere. Warm feeling"}
{"text":"Great fresh food.  Veg items. What a great find.  Staff very helpful picking out items.  I had the fish and was great.   Co worker found it.   Use local food when they can"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. Never had something I didn't like. Service is good for how busy it is too.  The wait is a while and you will need a reservation but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've tried half a dozen items on the menu and they are all delicious. This place opened while I was expecting my twins and the dishes all satisfied me, even when eating for three! My favorite is the open face salmon sandwich. There is a tomato chutney that comes with it that is to die for!  There prices are reasonable as well and the decor is very inviting, kind of hipster chic. You could dress up to go here, but it doesn't feel like to have to."}
{"text":"We saw the place and looked up the menu! It was perfect! Farm to table and healthy amazing food. We have been there 2 times in one week. I had the garden pasta the first time and the vegan meatballs the second time....LOVED them both! It's a fabulous place for 2 foodies like us!"}
{"text":"Love everything. Friendly staff, nice atmosphere, great food, good prices, convenient to the highway.  A pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"This one of my favorite places. The pizza is really good. I have eaten here more than 10 times and every time the meal and drinks-have been great. The staff does a great job!"}
{"text":"Woah! These guys have got it right and its in Solon!  If you go there, get pizza for sure but everything else on the menu is equally as good!"}
{"text":"56 kitchen is a great new addition to solon's restaurant options. The salads have all been good with adding salmon as a meal.  Burger and fries and pizza also very good.   This place is perfect for nicer meals out during the week and still nice enough for going out on the weekend.  No outdoor dining and location is in a strip mall but once inside decor is very comfortable and nice!  Good service."}
{"text":"56 Kitchen is the lovely, local modern eatery Solon has needed for so long! It is so unexpected in so many ways.  Their name is an extension of their sister restaurant, Caf√© 56, which features 56 types of salads. 56 Kitchen is all American fare, sourced responsibly with gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options. The inside is super chic with rustic accents and dark colors.  Also, I can't explain it, but the menu is worded in such a way where I want to eat everything. Pizzas? Sandwiches? Small plates? I'll have them all. Coming here hungry may be the best idea or the worst idea you've ever had. The servers are super knowledgeable and happy to help you make your choices. I loved the 56 Philly Steak sandwich! Would order it again in a minute.  When we had an issue during our meal, I was so impressed that the management came out right away to address it. That is so rare, and it's so uplifting to see a staff that truly cares about their customers! They also do take-out here, and I honestly cannot wait until I return. I think everyone on the east side should check out this place immediately, and for west siders, its worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for dinner on a Wednesday night with a party of 3.  We were seated immediately and we ordered a few cocktails to start and a Bruschetta three way and the olives and garbanzo beans appetizer.  The cocktails were very tasty (although I didn't much care for my husband's margarita, he loved it), but maybe a bit weak.  The bartender who made them wasn't impressed with his work on one of the cocktails so he made another one and brought it to the table and gave it to our dining companion for free.  She's not much of a drinker so the husband and I split it.  The appetizers were excellent.  I particularly loved the smoked eggplant dip and the roasted olives.  For entrees I had the vegan spaghetti and meatballs, the husband had a pizza with meatballs and our friend ordered the trout.  They loved their food.  I tasted the crust of the pizza and it was on point.  Mine was just okay.  It needed salt, which I added and that made it better.  I don't think I'm a fan of zucchini noodles.  I would have preferred real pasta.  Gimme all the carbs!!!  Our waiter was fantastic.  He explained the menu, described some of his favorites and was very attentive.  The owner (manager?) stopped by the table to chat with us as well.  The decor is upscale, warm and inviting.  Overall, a fantastic experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"56 kitchen is new to Solon which seems to be getting a much better spot for food.  56 kitchen is one of those new great restaurant/bars.  My wife and I came late on a Thursday night and were greeted with a friendly host who promptly sat us.   The decor is super cool and trendy, painted concrete floors, a wide open floor plan featuring lots of warm wood. The back wall is all old doors  and a huge stainless steel bar. What I liked most was the size of the rustic tables, they are much bigger than normal tables you don't feel cramped. As the food came out I then realized why the tables were so nice.   The menu is huge and varied, there is something for everyone. I'm sure my kids would love the pizzas which by the way Solon finally has some great pizza. That's because we love a crispy thin crust pie if that's your cup of tea. This was a huge pizza and fit nicely on the table. My wife likes to order a couple apps for dinner. She had a burrata and warm olive and garbanzo dish, with their homemade crusty bread yummo. I had the Salmon club and it was delicious all the ingredients were fresh and tasty.   The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. Both owners visited us graciously to see how we were doing.   Nice experience and since I'm not a drinker I didn't mention the bar but looked great with lots of local beers on tap.   Go to 56 kitchen. And enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Food is really good. Service is good. Prices are reasonable. The location is deceiving; it's in a strip mall next to a planet fitness. The kitchen is open and the ambiance is good. I've been here several times and would go again. The only complaint is they have no outdoor space at all."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed with the alright food and poor service.  At the recommendation by our waiter, we ordered the A Piedi Nudi (olive oil, roasted garlic, peppers, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, baby spinach, red onions, parmesean, mozzarella)- the crust of the pizza was decent and the ingredients fresh. Although it wasn't preferable to my palette, with the other toppings not standing out against the foundation and taste of cheese, this can certainly be a good option for cheese lovers.  We also had the Bordeaux braised beef short ribs, which were unfortunately dry and ruined the texture of the dish. Our side order of fries were just okay- they were near the soggy side, missing crisp, and did not have any particularly special taste. (Maybe people in Cleveland like soggy fries? I am still trying to find good fries in this city!)  The alcohol tasted somewhat weak, which isn't a bad thing for me since I'm a lightweight :) .. but others may not be happy about. The cider mimosa was delicious (I could barely taste the alcohol) and I loved the cinnamon sugar around my glass.  Overall, while the food was average to below average, the service unfortunately did not match the restaurant's attempt to create a restaurant of quality through its nice decor and menu options. We felt that we were waiting for a while to get attention since our table was at the very end of the restaurant, far from the bar area. Our server didn't ask us for water (someone bringing us our food did, but forgot to bring it to us) and we had asked for ketchup but only received it after a second request (our fries were nearly done by then).   We also had started our night off waiting at the bar and ordering drinks, which we needed to ask the waiter to add to our receipt at the end, else they would've forgotten. The bar itself felt somewhat disorganized, with servers coming in and out and the bartenders taking a bit to come take our order (a waitress passing by asked us for our order to help start us off). I would recommend management take a look at retraining employees to ensure quality service, and review the overall set up and workflow of the restaurant. The restaurant is notably long, making it difficult for waiters to tend to all their tables in a timely manner, particularly given the stretch between some customers and home base. I also noticed that our server was serving a table across the room.  While the atmosphere is certainly nice for a date night, my boyfriend and I likely will not be returning for a while provided the other options for good eats with higher quality service."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but this is my favorite place. I have probably tried half of the menu by now and have never been disappointed. My husband and I come here often and I bring new friends here every chance I get... everyone always loves it! There is something on the menu for everyone, from vegans to those with gluten intolerances. Amazing food at a good price point and good drinks, too. I recommend the house margarita!"}
{"text":"I picked out 56 Kitchen as a belated Valentine's Day date spot strictly based on fellow Yelper's reviews, and they certainly didn't disappoint.   We went on their website and made an online reservation. It was a Saturday night and was busy, but we didn't have to wait at all.   It's located in a strip mall, but don't let that scare you: it just means easy and plentiful parking. The ambiance and decor here is top notch. It's a really cool place.   Our waitress Courtney did a really good job. Always on top of our drinks, and quick with the check. She had a good understanding of the menu too. We wanted an appetizer and she recommended the artichoke hearts. They were bomb. The breading was so light, flaky and full of flavor. I could have drank the housemade dipping sauce out of the serving dish, but the wife probably wouldn't have been impressed. It was all that tasty.  Everything the waitresses were bringing out to the other guests looked so good. I'm that weirdo rubbernecking as they walk by with the trays, just trying to get a look at all the food.   We both ended up ordering burgers. My wife got the farmhouse burger, which had maple bacon and an egg on it. She loved how all of the flavors worked together. My burger was one of their nightly specials, and had bacon, a tomato jam, jalape√±os,  and a sharp cheese that really complimented the meat well. The brioche buns were light and tasted great, and I liked the heaping pile of fries. The burgers were awesome, and I'd order one again.   I'd say the only problem with the burgers was how both were cooked. We both ordered medium, and I'd say they were closer to medium-well, maybe even well-done. It gave them a fantastic crust, and I'm not picky, so I was still happy with it, but this could definitely upset someone that doesn't like a burger that way. This is the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 Stars. I would definitely come back though. I'd love to try a pizza next time."}
{"text":"Refreshing, casual towards upscale atmosphere with out-of-this-world food and reasonable prices. The rockfish featured that night dish was more than superb. We were skeptical when the waiter said that vegan spaghetti and meatballs were a favorite of customers until we tasted them. The artisan margarita pizza was a smash. The big finish? Hot and fresh peach cobblers in little skillets. It is a rare night out at a new restaurant when before you even get home you begin to think about who you will tell about the place and how soon you will return."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I have found in a strip mall location in Solon.  Really enjoyed the diversity of options on the menu - lots of vegetarian and vegan picks, that and gluten free all clearly denoted on the menu.  The dinner menu has something for everyone, the kitchen is making a wide range of different food genres.  Solid wine, beer and drink options - reasonably priced, just a tad expensive.  Menu items were also reasonably priced, perhaps a tad pricey for Solon, OH.  I ate the veggie burger, it was huge, and my husband enjoyed the pork chop (delicious but a tad salty).    I would definitely consider eating here again.  Biggest watch out - it was around ~10 degrees F outside, and we were seated near the door.  Got blasted every time someone came in, even though they had 2 doors.  Wish I was sitting closer to the kitchen...  UPDATE: I've dined 3 times now at 56 Kitchen and they've earned upgrade from 4 to 5 stars.  Consistently good service, their menu has something for everyone (all dietary needs), and good is always tasty."}
{"text":"56 Kitchen provides a new, contemporary, refreshing atmosphere that Solon has needed for years. I travel to the East side of Cleveland frequently for work and am always searching for new spots to dine. 56 Kitchen's menu is diverse and well rounded providing the guests with a wealth of delicious entrees and options. Vegetarian, Vegan and Gluten-free options are available as well making this a one stop shop for everyone. I recently had the Hawaiian pizza and French Kiss salad and was very happy with the quality in both presentation and taste. If you are seeking a new restaurant in the Solon area, 56 Kitchen is a must try!"}
{"text":"Been a few times now and seems as though service and quality have gone downhill since opening.   Disappointing due to how good they were the first couple times we visited.    Both times while going on a Saturday they told us the same excuse (different waiters) \"we're not normally this busy and trying to keep up\", but drinks took 25 minutes to make it to the table, by the time the entrees arrived we were starving.   My farm house burger was asked for medium but cook well done, the sunny side up egg was completely cooked and defeated the purpose of the egg running down the sides as it was supposed to, hungry we just accepted it and left.   At this point I don't plan on returning, the service and quality are definitely not worth the price when there are many other options in the area."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Great menu.  The fried artichokes are amazing.  No seriously, I get cravings for them on a weekly basis!  Plus the staff has been exceptionally pleasant when I have picked up a take out order.  Atmosphere is quiet and comfortable."}
{"text":"Wow this place really blew me away! I didn't know what to expect when I went here for the first time. Some of those small restaurants in plazas can be questionable but this 56 Kitchen is amazing! The decor here is modern meets farm. They are centered around using local foods and meats and their decor seems to further this mentality. It is clean, modern and comforting all at the same time. Both times I have come here have been for lunch and both times I ordered the veggie burger. I love veggie burgers and eat them all the time and I must say this one is in my top two! It's seriously that good. The veggie patty is made with brown rice, quinoa, back beans, corn and other legumes. It's crispy on the outside and piled with avocado, greens and tomato jam. I normally don't eat the buns with burgers, but here I have to!! It's a toasted ciabatta bun and it's so good! The sandwich comes with fries or you could sub out with dressed greens.  However, do not pass up the fries here.  They are amazing! They are cooked in soybean oil so at least it makes me think that they are healthier then fries cooked in vegetable oil or canola oils. They are crispy and seasoned to perfection.    Overall, this place is a winner!  The decor, service and food are exceptional and this all comes at a reasonable price.  If you are in the area, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.  First of all, from the outside you can see nothing inside but once you walk in the decor is just beautiful.  Metal trees line the walls and the space has an open, welcoming feel.  Our server was very funny and attentive.  The menu itself is filled with options for any type of eater.  Everything from a salad with grilled chicken to mac and cheese.  You can tell the food is extremely fresh and all made from scratch.  I ordered a cheeseburger and it was cooked to perfection and delicious!  The fries that came with it were fresh cut and also delicious.  Paired with a glass of Rose this meal and experience was excellent."}
{"text":"Great spot for either a couples night out or dinner with friends.  Large portions, strong spirits and make sure you try the bread pudding for dessert!  My wife had the salmon parka (sandwich) which had great flavor.  I had the center cut pork chop which also had great flavors including the vegetables. The best thing I can say about the entrees is that you can immediately tell when someone uses fresh ingredients and here they definitely used fresh ingredients which enhances the natural juices of the foods.  They don't have a microwave or freezer so meals are farm fresh and natural with an emphasis on local ingredients.  Service was friendly and plenty from the time we walked in to the time we left.  We left stuffed, satisfied and will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"At first I didn't think much of this restaurant as it was in the same space as many failed spots. It actually good. When we sat down we were greeted with the menu and put in our drink orders. After looking at the menu, the stars of the menu are hidden and I couldn't quite figure out what type of cuisine the restaurant was. I ordered the burger. It was perfectly cooked, seasoned very well and had wonderful fresh ingredients. Fries were perfect but I would suggest a garlic dipping sauce with them. My mom got Herb chicken and it was cooked extremely well. Great portions and pricing.   Only true downfall, poor atmosphere. I would suggest bringing down the lights a little more and a little louder music as the night goes on. I can tell it's a wonderful spots for after work drinks and late night drinks.  Food: Great Value: Great Drinks: Good Menu Selection: Ok, more specials so the Chef can figure out a final seasonal menu in the next few weeks Atmosphere: Eh"}
{"text":"I quickly figured out why 56 Kitchen owned such a strong Yelp rating...great service and outstanding cuisine, despite being buried in an unassuming strip mall.   Stopped into 'the 56' while in Ohio on business with two other colleagues. After consulting Yelp, we quickly zeroed in on this popular eatery in this suburb of the city that Lebron James made famous by winning the NBA Championship in 2016 after a 52-year professional sports title drought.   We started with the Artichoke Hearts with the house-made Fattoria Sauce....really tasty. Next we tried 56's two soups:  the Portuguese White Bean & Kale as well as their Silky Tomato Soup. Both were excellent.   For our entrees, two at our table enjoyed the Trout Marnier w/ Mashed Zucchini Quinoa and Roasted Brussels Sprouts. The delicious farm raised trout was meaty and saut√©ed just right.  The third person at our table also had the Herb Roasted Chicken and gave it rave reviews.   At the suggestion of our server, we had to jump for a few desserts recommended by our gregarious server including a slice of a dressed-up cheesecake and a unique triple chocolate delight.   The 56 Kitchen is a winner. It earns a coveted fiver. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went back to this place a second time, and it will be a while before we give it a third try.  Just overall mediocre.  Unattentive service, and the food was blah.  Waitress raved about the brisket sandwich - I tried it, and the brisket had huge chunks of fat in it.  What meat was there was VERY tender - unlike normal brisket, which has a little bit of 'chew' to it - in other words, it was tough to tell the fat from the brisket.  I love sweet potato fries.  These were cold and lifeless.  My wife had a dover sole special.  Decidedly average.  Disappointed.  And the waitress never asked how everything was - if she had, I would have let her know - oh well...."}
{"text":"Just go...You'll love the food. High energy and rather loud atmosphere, so it's for those looking for great food and fun."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very rustic but modern environment. My party all ordered pizzas which tasted absolutely delicious. The large was enough for two people (thin crust). They give many options for vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free. I love that because they are catering to a larger population & I could bring my diet restricted friends there. I was given fresh brewed coffee and our server Ed was very attentive. Prices are not bad either! I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"A great addition to the dining options in Solon. The restaurant is small enough to feel personal and has unique and fun decor.  We enjoyed our dinner and plan to go back. Definitely a fun choice that isn't a chain!"}
{"text":"Had the farmhouse burger and a salad. All ok but nothing special. Service was adequate but not a place I would rush back to."}
{"text":"Solid little place. Originally not too excited that it was located in a plaza but it is nicely decorated and once inside you wouldn't know it. Server named Lea was really nice and gave us great service. Tried the farmhouse burger and the pizza with pepperoni, meatball and sausage. They make the meatballs and sausage homemade. I enjoyed both the pizza and the burger. They also have sandwiches, salads and daily specials. I would like to go back and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Inconspicuously hidden in a strip mall next to Planet Fitness, where somebody's fat cousin Rob is eating pizza while he does arm curls on a leg extension machine, and a JoAnne's Fabric, where the average customer is 112 years old, sits 56 kitchen -  a trendy refuge for those seeking a modern dining experience.  Sitting at the beautiful stainless steel bar, surrounded by the carefully curated art and furnishings, I look over my options. The menu has a variety of greens, artisan pizzas, sandwiches, and entrees that are familiar enough to be comfortable, but with the slightest twists to keep it a little interesting. 56 kitchen gives you what you like, but they're not going to settle for serving you items you can get anywhere else.  On this trip I enjoyed their take on a Philly Steak Sandwich. The chili rubbed steak served with their fresh made horseradish spread and smoked mozzarella gave me the slightest hints of heat and smokiness all while still delivering on the things I already love and expect in the sandwich.   A visit to 56 Kitchen is like visiting your favorite grandparent. And as your wrapped in the warm familiar embrace, you look down to see he's sporting the latest pair of Yeezys. Because that's just how he rolls."}
{"text":"Simply delightful!! Awesome gluten free options - my daughter has celiac and tried the pizza, a salad, and sweet potato fries on several visits and loved it.  The burgers are fresh and delicious. They customize orders and always deliver such fresh and tasty meals I have a new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Had a salad to start followed by pizza and ended with some homemade donuts and everything was very good.  My first visit but won't be the last.  Enjoyed the vibe of the place, our server was awesome and the owner(s) was very friendly and stopped by the table just to check and make sure everything was what we wanted."}
{"text":"Ick. Falafel balls raw and gooey in the middle, even old city salad wasn't a safe entree. Chicken sandwich was dry and burned. Polenta bland and cold. Open face salmon was Ok, but the $12 drink sat with ice melting before being brought to the table and it wasn't a busy evening. Left and ate at the Paris Room, always wonderful. Never will go back."}
{"text":"Yummy veggie burger and it was very hearty. I had a pizza there a while back and it was different . Very friendly staff and the place looks classy ."}
{"text":"Solon seems cursed with a restaurant scene not worthy of its diversity and demographics. Thrilled to find this gem!  We traveled from Bainbridge here to find vegan fare for our veggie chomping college kid. Had never heard of it but it popped up on Yelp with my \"vegan\" search.  He had a sandwich of mushrooms and side of fries. I had a wonderful small pizza. Lady friend had a seared salmon. All great.  I snagged a draft IPA as well.  Storefront setting from outside is uninspiring. Deep space, welcoming when you enter. Great decor straddles upscale and approachable. Special occasion to grab a bite, seems to fit everyone. Beautiful bar and open kitchen in back."}
{"text":"Nice addition to the Solon area in the old BBQ place. Light and airy, nice venue. Large clean bar. Menu has a nice selection, including vegetarian dishes and gluten free.  Sandwich bread is tall, so we ate our sandwiches open face. Bread was tasty. Only concern is to be able to get my mouth around the sandwich next time."}
{"text":"Not only is the food excellent, the staff is great as well. I started with a wedge salad and had the philly as my entree. My wife had a chicken sandwich and my daughter the Mac and cheese. Everyone loved their meal. Highly recommended place. Go check it out."}
{"text":"This was an impromptu stop after leaving Aurora, and it turned out to be the best new place we've visited all season. Our server was knowledgeable and helpful. There are a TON of vegan and vegetarian options available, like, half the pizzas were veg*n, and the seasonal drink selection was great. My friend likes more comfort-style American fare while I am vegetarian and like a variety of flavors and textures, and this place absolutely delivered for both of us with ease.  The bruschetta was three creamy mousses with crostini, each incredible. I had the salad with caramelized pear which was light, crisp, and perfect. The barley risotto I ordered on the side was a nice accompaniment. My friend had the flank cheese steak sandwich and thought it was phenomenal.  Unfortunately, we didn't have time for dessert, but I look forward to trying it another time. The atmosphere inside was meant to mimic a small street or an alley like East 4th, cozy lighting and rustic art. It seemed like a busy but not overwhelmed place on a Saturday night.  If you're on the area, I highly recommend, especially for a party with different tastes and diets."}
{"text":"So good!! I've only been here twice, but both times it was outstanding! The menu is very diverse and there truly is something for everyone. The service is always good too!"}
{"text":"This place is just what the Solon area needed. I'll admit that without knowing much about this restaurant, I expected it to be much more franchisey I guess? I'm happy to report it definitely wasn't anything like what I expected. The inside is very rustic, with a hint of steampunk. There are refurbished barn doors and an upcycled chandeliers, with some quirky metal art formations on the walls. Despite the fact that it was a weeknight, it was very crowded when we visited, yet we were really well taken care of by our server. She ensured everyone's food came out for our 15 people party on time and the staff was extremely attentive throughout the meal.   It's really hard to pick off the menu here, they have everything from sandwiches to entree platters to pizzas to eclectic appetizer options. I was skeptical since most places really don't do a large quantity of things well, rather they can do one or two things well and the others are mediocre. Everything here seemed to be on point though- I ended up ordering a pizza, and I was so surprised how the pizza rivaled many of the wood fire oven specialty pizza places that have been popping up. It had that delightfully thin and crunchy outer crust, with a fluffiness and bite on the inside that made it just perfect. My friend ended up getting the trout which was very well cooked, a perfect crust on the outside but not overcooked on the inside.   The highlight thought was the dessert. Not being a huge dessert fan myself, I was first surprised when I was told this restaurant has a specified dessert chef that prepares different desserts daily. This I had to try! It ended with me ooing and awing over the dulce de leche, easily one of the most delicious desserts I've ever put in my mouth. The only downside is that since their desserts change daily, if you find something you like, it's highly unlikely you'll be able to order it again.   What became really clear to me on my visit here is that the staff here is really committed to quality in a way that most restaurants at least in this part of town just aren't. They care about both quality ingredients and good preparation, and I think for the price point of this restaurant, you are getting way more than you pay for, which to me, is a very very good thing."}
