{"text":"My partner and I tried this place a few weeks ago, I believe it was shortly after they opened. The food was great, tasted fresh, and came out surprisingly fast considering only one chef was behind the counter preparing food for eight tables plus takeout. The server was super friendly, fast and accommodating.  If you are ordering off the main menu, the selection is awesome, had everything we are use to plus a few items we had never seen before. The AYCE menu is decent, but doesn't have the biggest selection, as well as having order limits on some of the items. In my opinion, if you are gonna put a limit on an item. Maybe it should just simply be left out of the AYCE menu, aside from that it's a nice little spot with great food and great service. It's worth a try."}
{"text":"Good price for the quality. the menu it's limited only for Japanese food, while most ayce places will have Asian food fusion. So far the taste is ok, sushi is fresh and nice quantity. Nice atmosphere. 

Udon soup is amazing. I'm very happy because they use real udon. 

Perfect 10/10"}
{"text":"The food is fine, the price is fair, but the service is unbearable. The staff aren't rude, but you're either ignored for long stretches or you have someone up your butt every two seconds.

And forget ordering delivery. Every time I've gotten delivery my order has taken well over an hour to arrive and only arrives after I call to make sure it went through. On the chance it does arrive in a reasonable amount of time the order is wrong 100% of the time.

Edited:
I had sworn this place off because of their terrible delivery times but decided to give them one more shot. Delivery time comes and goes. I call to see where my food is. The woman on the line says \"I just have to pack it up and it will be ready soon.\" Soon? It was already supposed to have been delivered 10 minutes ago and it's not even packed up!

I'm done. I'm never wasting money on them again."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! Amazing beef ribs, awesome fried calamari and great sushi. The service wasn't great, but they were really busy Saturday evening. Best AYCE (but possibly only) sushi place around high park. We have been twice and will be going back."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for all you can eat. Everything was perfect. Tasty, clean, value, and friendly. Be sure to order the BBQ beef and tempura banana. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Well, I decided to give this place another shot, and they failed miserably. 

First off they are terribly understaffed.  Secondly, due to the fact that they are understaffed, they get irritated customers who leave because they've been waiting to long for their take out food (saw this happen). 

And Third, I do not appreciate leaving two pieces of shrimp tempura on my plate and being told  that I'll be overcharged due to that after I've been in your establishment for over an hour waiting to be fed, and because I've been waiting so long, I've digested what I've had, so when the rest of my food comes, I'm not as hungry as I was when I first got here. One of the servers was kind enough to thank us for waiting, but it was just too much.

This place is def a miss! I'll take my well earned cash and hunger to a less petty place"}
{"text":"Honestly this place is average food, decor is a lot better then the old Wasabi green. 

Personally I would shy people away from chicken dishes, its pretty low quality (tendons). 

Rolls were ok. 

The dishes you would expect to be safe were definitely safe, including, terriyaki, tempura etc.

If there are dishes that aren't good, be prepared to eat them anyways or argue with the owner, or you can expect to pay. I get the policy forsure, it prevents waist...  but no one should eat chicken tendons and pay."}
{"text":"We live in bloor west village and wanted to check out somewhere that had all you can eat. This is the best sushi I have had in a very long time. The sushi is fresh and seriously delicious.  I am super impressed and will be going back soon!  $13.99 for lunch and I think $19.99 for dinner.
The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because although they are very nice, service for us was pretty slow. They seemed to pay more attention to other tables and forgot to bring some of our food.
Overall, GREAT place for sushi in the west end."}
{"text":"Great food, good ambiance and friendly staff.  It doesn't look like much from the outside but the fish was fresh and tender.  They offered a good selection of sashimi & sushi.  I am coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was very bland.  The eel maki rolls were made of so much rice that I could barely even see the eel inside. The eel sushi we ordered the eel on top were just half of the length of the rice.  The beef tataki didn't taste right, it was sour and the beef wasn't red.. it was like dark red.. wasn't fresh at all! In terms of service, we only had one round of ordering and sumone just came up to us with our second round of order and said if we have to order more and unable to finish the food they would charge us. Yes we had some left overs from the first round but it was just the beef that didn't look fresh enough to eat and some rice. Not even one piece of sashimi! I was really unsatisfied with their service. . And also quality of their food... they didn't taste like sushi...Please trust this review and think twice before u go"}
{"text":"I came here for my first time a couple of days ago on family day for dinner. I did not like the service and the food was not spectacular. 

As soon as I walked in a person came up to us, asks how many people, and tells us that a table would be ready really soon as a group was leaving and walks away. Then another person comes up and tries to find us a table. The first person quickly comes back and takes us to the table but the table still needed cleaning. Then I decided to go back to the door and waited there. I found the staff there to rush too much and they were too eager. Even with the first thing that was served they were rushing so much. The miso soup was placed on the table so fast that some soup spilt over on to the table and the server walks away without knowing! My friend and I just looked at each other and laughed. We found that ridiculous.

Now the food. The beef ribs that was served to us were cold. Too much rice and not enough goods in the sushi rolls. I wanted to have mango pudding for dessert but that was unavailable :(

The value is there. $20 for all you can eat is good, but I was not a fan of the food or service.

A good thing about this place is that there's parking here as it's a mini plaza, but parking is quite limited. It's close to Keele station if you've TTCing.

Tips for this restaurant: Slow down and focus on good service."}
{"text":"Modern AYCE sushi restaurant located on Keele and Bloor that provides an extensive list of food choices for a relatively cheap price.

Service is swift and friendly ,the sushi is delicious and fresh. Must try the TAKO sashimi !!and the BBQ BEEF RIBS?"}
{"text":"The sushi is great quality. But when you enjoy AYCE sometimes some of the things you marked on your card go missing. For example the sashimi or the shrimp. If you mark 10, be prepared to ask again because sometimes these mysteriously go unserved. I get that these are the more expensive dishes, but then don't serve them. Not great service . How dare they \"forget\" our shrimp. We are paying customers and demand to eat all we can enjoy."}
{"text":"After searching an all you can eat sushi restaurant within the $21-25 price range we have finally found it. The sushi is always fresh and has lots of flavour. All of the food is very good. The problems with this place start when you try to park. Only about 4 parking spots out front if you can even get into the lot. No other parking close by.  This isn't a huge deal but my biggest problem is that they space out your orders for a sometimes ridiculous length. Now the place itself is not that big so the slow service is very brutal. We have been here 3 times and no matter what the service is so slow you find yourself asking \"do we still have food coming?\"  I will say though they are very good at picking up dirty plates when you are done and are very friendly, just whoever is making the sushi is very slow. Overall the food is great and the people are kind but if you are in a hurry you should definitely avoid this restaurant (or try their take out i guess?"}
{"text":"Good food, variety, and price. Delivery also came in 10 minutes faster than expected. Giving them 3 stars for now as they forgot an item on our order and it was a long call to convince them that they odd not deliver to, although in the end they came through. 

We'll give them another shot and update this review based on our next experience!"}
{"text":"It's very good. The soft shell crab is my favorite on the menu that I ordered. Friendly staff good service. Very reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Don't even offer water. Dirty, I saw the waitress serving the glass of orange juice on the floor!"}
{"text":"Decent service, horrible food.

Note: Came here for a lunch AYCE. Loved the decor. First thing you'll notice is that the menu is color coded so some items are only available if you pay an extra 6 dollars(on top of the 15.99). These items include popular dishes like seaweed salad and most of the non-rice dishes. This was the first indication that something fishy was going on--pun intended.

We ordered a bit of everything available. Anything with tempura batter was fantastic, and the katsu is actually breaded and fried properly. It was as good as if you went to a diner that only served katsu.

Then came the maki and nigiri which were some of the worst I've ever had in North America. The ingredients were great. Frankly the salmon was the best I've had in an AYCE restaurant and the bbq eel was on point, however the rice in all the rolls and nigiri was just excessive. Not only was there a lot of rice, the rice was packed and dense. I resorted to picking off rice from my sushi just so I could taste the ingredients. I estimated each piece of nigiri had about a cup of rice that had been squeezed together. This ended up filling me and my guest up really fast, and we both left feeling stuffed and cheated as we didn't really get to try much. 

If you go to this sushi restaurant, stay away from the sushi.

In terms of service, my guest and I were one of only two tables occupied during lunch service and we counted at least three items didn't make it to our table after ordering. The waitress was incredibly friendly and attentive, which is why we didn't say anything."}
{"text":"Excellent food and selection. Great hours. Parking is a bit difficult and limited. Price is good for the amount of food you can choose from. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is honest but the service is bellow acceptable. Really inexperienced waitresses. All of them."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday after a long day at work. We've been here before but today the service was exemplary. They were extremely nice, happy and courteous. After we were done with every plate it was immediately cleared. We even witnessed another table spill a drink. There was no pause, the server grabbed a towel, cleaned the mess and brought them another drink. Overall, they're service is amazing and the food is great. The price is well worth it."}
{"text":"The food lacked flavour.  The menu is very good looking but very poorly executed and our miso was watery. The service however,  was excellent!"}
{"text":"What a fat joint!
Me and my sister ate for almost 5 hours until they kicked us out... I don't recommend bringing Ziploc freezer bags for the ol' Buffet Bag-a-roo ShimSham --- They didn't get mad at us... Just probably thought we were homeless. 
LOVED IT... BACK ONCE A MONTH... Booze is pricey... BYOB ;)"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing sushi but service was a little slow. And the gap between sushi rolls was kind of ridiculous, but you know what it's worth it for cheap but great sushi. I've been twice and both times the sushi was filling and very appetizing, very great service as in they know how to speak to you with respect. I'd recommend people coming here, and at 21.99 all you can eat it's a bargain! Recommend FORSURE!  Waitresses are also hit or miss, they are either very friendly or very rude."}
{"text":"We went to sushi place for dinner last night, and it was terrific. The service was excellent and the food was really good value. The portions were generous, and they even give us more rice for our take-out without charging us. The yam avocado rules aren't quite as good as other places, but still pretty good. The waitress was especially helpful with our children and giving advice on what they would like.
I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The smell of Japan greats you, as you enter the restaurant. Sushi is served remarkably fast. I ordered to go, but as I waited I noticed fancy Koyo plates on the table. This place is definitely authentic,However in hindsite the portions are quite small."}
{"text":"This is THE PLACE for SUSHI.  No really, it is, even the name says it.  Honestly, it's such a terrible name, that I almost hesitated going in here and the fact that it's next to a gas station and a 7-11, but because of the good reviews, I ventured in anyways.  

What I loved:
-BEST SERVICE EVER FOR AN AYCE JAPANESE JOINT.  The waitress I had explained the different buffet options to me.  $13.99 for black items, $19.99 if you order any red items.  All items came within 10 minutes of ordering.
-The option to have sashimi at $19.99 for lunch
-BBQ BEEF RIBS.  So tender, so much meat, so juicy, so lovely, so want more now.  
-SASHIMI.  At $19.99, I don't expect the biggest selection of sashimi, but they still had salmon, butterfish, tuna, snapper, crab meat and octopus (tako).  
-TOBIKO...nice melt in your mouth fish eggs.  Btw, I wanted to point out to all my fellow masago lovers, tobiko is more expensive than masago therefore BETTER!
-SEAWEED SALAD - was fresh and had a nice crunch to it. 
-The spoon that came with the ice cream.  Cute.

What I liked, but didn't love:
-Beef sashimi - cooked perfectly but lacking marination.  Added soya sauce to it, then it tasted good.
-Agedashi tofu - fresh and hot, needed a bit more seasoning, but regardless great fried healthy food haha
-The decor.  It was open and modern, but it felt like a cross between a cafeteria, a noodle place and a chain restaurant.  Kind of weird, but it was very clean, so a-ok.  Washrooms were very clean too.  
-The unagi sushi.  Unagi was tasty, but too much rice on the bottom.  
-Tuna sashimi and tako sashimi had a limit of 3 pcs per person.  Understandable at the price point.  

What I didn't like:
-Spicy salmon hand roll - while there were two large pieces of salmon, I felt the rice portion was excessively big and the seaweed wasn't crunchy enough to give the hand roll that nice crunchy taste.
-Ikayaki - grilled octopus.  Too chewy.

Verdict: I'd definitely go again and next time, will try the rolls.  Don't let the gas station and the 7-11 fool you, this is a diamond in the rough.

TL;DR: good sashimi and ribs at cheap price, just go

PS - SORRY TO ONE OF MY FAVE YELPERS FOR TRYING TO BE PUN-NY in my opening line."}
{"text":"Our orders took forever to arrive. We were a group of 7 and the time span between the first order that arrived and the last was one hour. Our It was only decent food. Not worth it and won't come back."}
{"text":"good happy feeling the first time i came here to celebrate for a big life changing event! so there's continuous good happy vibe associated with this place for me! :D

ok the food. fresh fish, most rolls are quite decent with rice/fish ratio (except spider roll - that thing is nuts). like any good AYCE sushi experience, i felt full and content afterwards. very fast service and happy staff. recommended!"}
{"text":"Had the all-you-can-eat meal again. Had to have the spicy crispy rolls.  Had to come back. 

You did right by me this time sushi place.  I know it was only cuz I was in the $19.99 dinner zone. The chicken katsu was still very sharp, our chop sticks were dirty and there was a piece of white crud at the bottom of my bf's glass. Eeew. 

Everything tasted great...except for the general tao.  It was weird and obviously with error. Some knucklehead in the back was probably foolin' around with the paprika or deep fryer settings. It was off.  

Sometimes I close my eyes and try to imagine the shrimp tempura rolls.  

It's a shame that the utensils were kinda dirty cuz that was a 5-star sushi experience for taste/texture... except for the general tao. We also had banana tempura with green tea ice cream.... it was fabulous.

4 stars!"}
{"text":"We were in the area on Sunday to walk in High Park and see the Cherry Blossoms.  Decided to go here for a late all you can eat lunch.

The all you can eat (ayce) menu at Sushi Place was slightly below average.  About what you can expect from a lunch menu, but missing some common items like Salmon Teriyaki, Shrimp Tempura and Kalbi ribs.  

Since the menu is ayce, we ordered avacado salad, salmon/white tuna/crab sushi, vegetable tempura, green dragon roll, chicken teriyaki and a number of other items.

They did have some alternate menu items like salmon katsu and fried eggplant.  The food was okay.  Fish on the sushi was fresh though they give us a lot of rice.

The restaurant was extremely busy and the waiters/waitresses never really found time to check on us.  They managed to get all our orders right in our first round of orders and most of our orders right on our second round.  Overall, the service was satisfactory but unimpressive.

We got a large meal for a decent price.  It was not a memorable experience.

2.2 / 5.0"}
{"text":"I went to The Sushi Place on the recommendation of reviews I'd read on Yelp. While I agree with others - one should always expect less-than-stellar quality sushi and maki when heading to an AYCE establishment - I nonetheless think The Sushi Place is pretty damn good for both the lunch (13.99) and dinner price points (19.99). 

The rolls aren't overburdened with rice and they do really good tempura - the vegetables aren't limp and over-fried. Service was very friendly and attentive, too. However, I went at lunch, so I can't speak to how they deal with crowds. 

In terms of quality, The Sushi Place *easily* outdoes downtown establishments like Aji Sai or the AYCE sushi restaurants at Yonge and Dundas, where your roll is barely formed thanks to the rush. If you live in High Park, the Junction, or Roncie, this should be your go-to for AYCE."}
{"text":"The food was just ok but the service was horrible. Clearly the staff aren't ready to service an \"all you can eat\" crowd. We waited over an hour just to get a few dishes served, and left hungry because we couldn't wait for the rest of the dishes to come out. Paid $27 for it all, ugh! DON'T DO IT."}
{"text":"Sushi Place is a good decision for AYCE sushi. The fish tasted fresh, service was prompt, and the price was quite reasonable. I'll be back and if you're looking for a nice place to grab sushi around High Park then I would recommend giving Sushi Place a try.

I'm not certain how this place is getting 1 stars, but that certainly wasn't the service I received."}
{"text":"Hmm okay first off, this place was alright, it passed but barely. The menu was very big with many vegetarian options and tons of different sushi options as well as entrees like general Tao chicken and teriyaki salmon. We ordered yam roll, shiitake mushroom rolls, California rolls, salmon avocado rolls, chicken teriyaki rolls, fried philedelphia rolls, calamari, , grilled squid, beef ribs, veggie tempura, salmon, tuna and eel nigiri and beef enoki.The sushi was not fresh at all and tasted like straight up lake water. The tuna nigiri tasted like tuna salad and had the texture of playdo. NOT good. The chicken teriyaki rolls were just chicken and cucumber on top of teriyaki sauce that they dumped on the plate and placed the rolls on top of(?) the enoki beef was AMAZING on the other hang. So much flavour and was cooked to perfection. The tempura yam rolls were quite good as well but we're very hot. The beef ribs were very rare and still had some blood oozing from it. The fried Philadelphia rolls were so bad, I'm not sure why they don't just have normal Philly rolls? The calamari was not that great and the batter was not tempura but was very weird and I did not like it that much. The service was alright, but a little slow and they didn't charge us for the extra food we did not eat. For dessert we got ice cream with fried banana and it was quite good. So overall the place was alright, the entrees were much better than the sushi and I would only recommend getting he sushi if you want veggie rolls because the fish was not very fresh"}
{"text":"Great selection.  Good prices.  Convientently near Keele Station.  Looking forward to visiting again... :)"}
{"text":"This is where we also go for AYCE. I wonder if they got a new chef since the sushi tasted different than before when we came this time. The rice was so warm and soft which was a bit weird. Other than that everything seems fair as usual."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place on a Sunday afternoon. It was not busy, and we were seated right away. 
We went for the AYCE menu. They definitely had a decent selection of rolls, and nigiri and appetizers to satisfy our hunger needs. 
They even have dessert to top it off."}
{"text":"Delicious and very fresh sushi. Generous pieces! They do use a lot of rice; really good all the same. We had the mango and green tea ice cream to finish and both were very good.  The service was efficient - they did forget my tea - but brought it as soon as I reminded them. Get ready for a little weight lifting because the teapot was pretty heavy."}
{"text":"The food is ok but not great. If you order delivery they will take an hour and half. I've ordered delivery a few times and they are usually very late. They don't have great customer service either when I call to ask about the status of my order."}
{"text":"Five stars because where else can you spend $20 and get sushi this fresh at an all-you-can eat place in Toronto? Nowhere. You may find something better by paying a lot more, but Sushi Place is a great value. 

Not only does sushi place have very fresh, artfully prepared sushi and shashimi, they also do hot dishes well as well. If you are with a friend/family member who doesn't do raw, the hot selections, such as a sweet and sour chicken or the shrimp tempura are fine.

Bring your appetite. There is a lot to choose from. Also, service is very good here. They also offer beer, wine, and sake.

If you are on the TTC, Sushi Place is right around the corner from the Keele Station on the north side of Bloor Street. Since parking is somewhat limited, transit is a better option."}
{"text":"What a lovely find. I noticed this place the other day and when I read the reviews here I decided to try it. The staff are quite nice. The rolls done well, everything was delicious and flavourful. My only wish was that they would have a larger font/ picture menu. The all you can eat list was very small and I has to read the items to my mum. 
Otherwise, terrific. The spicy crispy tuna roll was a favourite. Also impressed with the hot items. Super yummy and the price is right. This is my new ayce sushi place. I will be back and I'm bringing friends."}
{"text":"I'm very happy to say that this place is worth a try. It's ayce and I paid 45$ for two people everything included. The waitress was very kind and they have a lot of variety.. Sushi, rolls, sashimi.. And it was pretty quick. It's very close to Keele station. I found this place thanks to the yelpers. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Oh hi there, cheap & cheerful AYCE sushi place in my 'hood!

I've eaten in/picked up/ordered delivery and have always had great service. The fish is fresh and the prices are reasonable. Variety of rolls and vegetarian options. 

This place is right by Keele subway and a great stop for any High Park visitors. Parking at this location isn't the greatest - not a ton of parking spots."}
{"text":"Very satisfying!

I had passed this place a few times but never tried it until last night.  I am glad I did!  The food was fresh and fast and delicious! 

 I also have to praise the service. I was hungry when I arrived and the waitress suggested that maybe they hold off on some of the plates as I may not have room (you order all the food at once) She was right! !! Thank you! !

We will definitely  be coming back!"}
{"text":"Wow I it's  very  special  roll  for my  friend, what  can  I say,......soooooooooooo yummy yo!___

{"text":"I went here back in April 2014.
The spring rolls smelled like manure, and tasted off.
Felt sick after eating.

Seeing all the good reviews, I'm hoping they've improved their food quality."}
{"text":"It's clear that the owners of this joint have focused on SPEED - get food out quickly, fill people up quickly, and have them leave quickly. I didn't appreciate that about Sushi Place. Service was minimal and rushed - there were only two servers working the near-full restaurant on the Wednesday night I went, so they were busy.

Sushi rolls were rice-heavy, so I got full much sooner than I usually do. Rolls aside, I recommend the ikayaki (grilled squid), beef tataki, and dumplings. The stir-fried mushrooms were in a sauce that totally ruined the taste and texture, so I definitely don't recommend that dish. Overall, food was quite good.

Don't go out of your way for this place... There's definitely better AYCE in the city."}
{"text":"We are weekend regulars. Service is always friendly and sushi tasty. Good selection for AYCE. Never seem to be more than 3 or 4 tables eating at any one time but fish is always fresh and the price is right."}
{"text":"Do not eat here!! Some of the worst sushi I've had in Toronto. We ordered for pick up and when we got home, I discovered that they had screwed up our order. We ordered the Volcano Roll and instead were given a disgusting deep fried roll with cheese in it. It wasn't even edible. If you want good sushi, go to Sushi on Bloor - WAY better than Sushi Place!"}
{"text":"One of the better AYCE in the city. Food isn't fancy or trying too hard. Its honest, simple and great quality. The service is great and parking is readily available in the surrounding side streets. For the price and selection I would have to recommend this place for anyone in the area. By the way the sushi rice quality is good for any sushi rice critics."}
{"text":"We went for the all-you-can-eat dinner and were met with great quality food and excellent service.  My boyfriend and I went in the early evening on a Sunday.  The restaurant was empty when we arrived (slightly worrisome) but quickly filled up with couples. 
We tried a variety of maki, sushi and sashimi which were all well made.  The fish was also very good quality for an all-you-can-eat restaurant.
Happy that a great new sushi place popped up in the area and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had dinner here yesterday with a group of 6. We were told to order less because they thought we ordered too much and they didn't want to have to charge us for the extra.

We got our first load of food and that was it. From there, no matter what we ordered we would get a maximum of one dish on the table at a time and have a 10 minute wait for the next one. We had to reorder a dish of fried rice 3 times, we never received 4 of the dishes we ordered, and all the while other tables had TONS of food.

It's a shame because one of the people I was with had been there twice before with positive experiences, but none of us will be back. There are far too many sushi restaurants in this city to bother dealing with slow service and empty tables.

We were there for an hour and a half, spoke with staff multiple times about our issues and ended up leaving still hungry."}
{"text":"bf and I loved this spot the first time we came. 2nd time, not so much. the service was okay, food took long in between and sometimes things never even came. my bf wishes they had an ipad system cause he likes to see pictures. overall, decent place! average prices, average food, average service."}
{"text":"Accepted my payment and confirmed my order via Just-Eat, then they called and said because it was after 3 and they had decided to close early (I had made my order beforehand but the page took awhile to load) they would not make my food and would have to call Just-Eat for THEM to give me my money back and that they wouldn't give me a refund themselves.
Don't need to try their food to know I'm never giving them my service again!"}
{"text":"Came here to try the all-you-can-eat lunch, ordered avocado salad, salmon katsu, chicken katsu, pork katsu, beef stir fry udon, salmon sushi pizza, edamame, veggies tempura, deep fried beef dumplings, salmon dragon roll, spider roll, some nigiri sushi and some hand rolls.  
There was quite a wait after the salad and soup were served. There were only three other tables of customers.
The hot food tastes decent, but each dish portion varies quite differently, the chicken katsu feels like two big servings while the salmon katsu contains of only three small cut-up pieces.
The special rolls (salmon dragon roll and spider roll) are ok, but the nigiri sushi and hand roll are horrible.  The sushi rice is warm and mushy, it doesn't taste like Japanese rice at all.  The fish doesn't taste fresh or flavourful.
The waitress seemed rushed and a bit impatient, she just put down the dishes without explaining what was being served.  When we asked which katsu (one of us doesn't eat pork) was on the table, she just replied \"it's katsu.\"
I was a little disappointed about this meal, because I've heard some good comments about this place from my friends.  $13.99 is a fair price for the selection that is offered.  You will get full but your taste buds will not be satisfied."}
{"text":"I wanted to review this place well. I wanted it to be great. What's not to like about $21.99 AYCE sushi a walk from my apartment? Sadly, a lot.

Ill start with the bad. For starters, the miso soup was lukewarm at best and had very little flavour. The tempura shrimp was so greasy and way over battered. The beef tataki was thinly stripped and flavorless. The tuna sashimi was TINY and tasted bland. Actually all of the sashimi was a little too fishy and generic. 

Perhaps the most striking problem was how much bloody rice they had on everything. The spider roll was one of the worst examples... I actually opened a piece up because I literally couldn't see any soft shell crab. I feel like it is a deliberate way to try and fill up customers to make up for their lower than usual AYCE price.

The good? Friendly service. Cheap. The beef mushroom was delicious and the honey shrimp quite tasty. Spicy salmon was decent. Kitchen food is probably good here, and some of the rolls are good.

Overall, it is just bland. Meh. Not a lot of flavour. Feels like they are just trying to fill your gut so you gtfo as quickly as possible. We didn't even have dessert.

I would come back only if I was super hungry and wanted to stuff my face.... gonna spend a little bit extra and go to an actual Japanese sushi restaurant and buy Ala Carte. This place feels more like a trough."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of sushi, but when I'm craving vegetable tempura, miso soup and spring rolls, this is the place to go! 

Good sized portions, quick service and tasty food!! And it helps that it's a 2 minute walk from my place ;)"}
{"text":"This place was really bad. The rice was either not properly cooked or stored because it was mushy and mealy and had no texture at all. Sushi was poorly cut and wasn't even properly thawed.

The service was also terrible. Haphazard serving times, no help when you need it, dishes forgotten completely, and they'll eventually forget about you entirely once you've had a couple courses.

I can't say I expected very much from an all you can eat sushi restaurant next to keele station called \"sushi place\" but it managed to let down my very low expectations. On the other hand, it definitely is a \"sushi place\" so at least the name is honest."}
{"text":"Pros:
- The quality of the food is terrific every time. I've been to the place over half a dozen times, and it's always delicious. I particularly enjoy the bento boxes that come loaded with food.
- The all-you-can-eat option is great, especially for the price ($19.99 for dinner, $12.99 for lunch). I've gone for lunch with the AYCE, and was very impressed with the speed and quality of all the dishes.
- The service is great. The servers, especially one, are always friendly, attentive and occasionally provide freebies (I guess since my family and I are pretty loyal by now).

Cons:
- The atmosphere is okay, but could use a bit of an improvement. The walls are bare and it could use some decor, but I'm sure it'll eventually come.

Overall: A fantastic Japanese option in Toronto's west end. Definitely worth a shot."}
{"text":"Amazingly priced AYCE sushi! Little heavy on the rice for the sushi, and it's never super cold (which I liked). My favourite thing to get is the dynamite rolls! Love the staff here, always nice and pleasant. Great place for a cheap bite to eat, pretty good sushi all around!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I order takeout from them all the time and the food is consistently good. A seaweed salad, spicy salmon roll, and Philadelphia roll bring me to around 30 bucks, which is decent. The servers are great too."}
{"text":"Update:  they still get 5 stars, despite the fact that 3 times they've given me the wrong thing off the AYCE menu.

Almost everything is good, and much of the food is very good.  The garlic shrimp is such a treat.

I'm giving them 5 stars despite the fact that they gave me beef when I checked off chicken as one of the AYCE choices.

Everything I tried was good, and the service was prompt and decent.

And I found one of the sushi masters cool.  He dropped off my plate of Dynamite Rolls, and when I thanked him he said you're welcome in a booming voice with a Japanese accent that made me feel it wouldn't be unlikely that he might have a Samurai sword back in the kitchen."}
{"text":"another great experience, this time beef udon which was ready for takeout in I guess 7-8min! very tasty and great consistency. price is okay, as expected I guess :) will be back of course. a neighbourhood staple."}
{"text":"Hella good. 

Came to Sushi Place for AYCE lunch today and was not disappointed. Sunday afternoon and it's not too packed and all the fish tasted fresh and clean. 

Everything was prepared promptly and the service was top notch. I'd come here again. 

Pace yourselves when ordering/eating tho; you'll definitely want some of that green tea ice cream at the end. It's the business!!"}
{"text":"The food was served quickly and was delicious.  Maybe not the fastest service by the waitress, but I was told I was being impatient.  Would definitely come here again.  Come before 3 and take advantage of the lunch pricing!"}
{"text":"RIGHT around the corner from Keele station, this place doesn't look like much in its little strip mall. But it's EXCELLENT.  The sushi is well-made and delicious.  The AYCE is great, lots of items and everything is tasty. And prices are great.  I was so impressed and I will be coming back many times in the future :D"}
{"text":"The people are going wild for Sushi Place, and I can't blame them. 

What a lunch-stravaganza of fresh fish and lightly battered tempura I just had. We had the To Go option, because it's Spring in Toronto but the service seemed lovely and apparently their AYCE is off the chain. I'll be back and update you soon, but for today, my jeans are just a tad too tight. 

You're near the park, they are reasonably priced and fresh. What's not to dig? Sushi Place.  It's what's for lunch."}
