{"text":"Fantastic! Loved this place! We went on a weeknight during the Comedy Fest. Place was hopping but service was very friendly and attentive. Food all around was great; the cod was superb! The caramel cheesecake was to die for! Plenty for two! On the negative side, it was a bit noisy even though we sat in a sheltered corner, and the coffee was dismal."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with a friend and got a table for two right away. The regular poutine was delicious and definitely worth trying. We not got the beef burger and were not disappointed. It comes with fries and green salad, I'm not a salad person but I ate all of cuz it was that good. The only thing bad I have to say about this place is that once we got the check it said the tip was included but when the waitress came she told us tip wasn't included and we had to shed out more money.  I was visiting Montreal as a tourist and I really didn't enjoy being taken for an idiot! Other than that I guess the place is worth checking if you just want some drinks and bar food."}
{"text":"We spent a week at the Hyatt just down the street. The hotel bar staff recommended it as a local institution so we tried it out.  I had a beer there a couple times and found it very friendly. The first time we eat at Nyk's was great. The Belle Gueule Rousse beer was great and the hand battered Fish and Chips Rocked. I saw someone eating a burger and it looked large and good.

We went again a few days later during the the jazz fest. Everyone was just as friendly and again we sat on the street to people watch.  I ordered the burger and my wife got the chicken burger.  They were Okay, but not what I expected. The burger looked smaller, but was still good. My wife said her chicken burger was pretty flavorless.

For the most part I am going to chalk our second experience up to the craze of the jazz fest. If you have attended you'll understand.  We sat down at 3:30pm by the time we left at 4:30 there were no seats to be had. The atmosphere and the friendliness of the staff make up for it. And there was never any pressure to vacate our table. I'd try it again in a heart beat. If you like good food, good people and rustic. This is the perfect place."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Fresh and fast with an excellent selection of beer/wine. The service isn't the best, but that's Montreal in a nutshell."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer. Not pretentious at all. Cozy, casual vibe with upbeat background music. Sit inside or outside of the garage doors. Excellent selection of local beers on tap. The food was pretty good; the burger wasn't anything to die for but the fries were very good. The burger was served with a salad, which made me feel a little less guilty. Go with friends or alone, it doesn't matter!"}
{"text":"One of the few places i'm happy to admit that I'm an addicted local. Great energy and ambiance, an extensive wine/beer liquor list, and food that smells so good it will stop you in your tracks... And tastes better then it smells!! Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly high quality food at a small corner pub."}
{"text":"Great burger and nice selection of local beers. When we visited the place was quite packed but we still managed to find a table. The staff was also fast and friendly and they don't rush you out of the door just because you haven't ordered a drink 5 seconds after you finished your previous one. The vista is probably not the nicest due to some bare land on the other side of the street, but it doesn't really distract from the stylish interior. That and I'm just a fan of having stuff listed on blackboards ;-)"}
{"text":"Loved the casual, friendly atmosphere. I expected standard pub fare, but got the best steak I've eaten in Montreal. I'm jealous of Montrealers who have this as their corner bar.

I can't stand it when restaurants just hand you a cold, hard roll, so I was glad to see some fresh warm bread to start. It was perfect for dipping the savory cream of celery soup, which had a great flavor yet didn't taste too heavy. The main course I had was a flank steak (bavette) of bison with a whiskey horseradish sauce with fries and a side of roasted yellow squash, zucchini and bell peppers. The sauce didn't really taste like whiskey or horseradish, but it was damn good, so who cares. Steak came grilled to a perfect medium, and was very tender. I know entrecote/contrefilet is the local favorite around here, but this flank steak blows it out of the water."}
{"text":"Great little place with a cozy neighborhood vibe. $5.75 pints from 4-7 makes it a good spot to sit outside and watch the world of Montreal!"}
{"text":"I had the worse service of my life. Seriously only 2 ppl working. Ordered 2 drinks & 1 appetizer & water. Drinks came then I asked for water again. She responds with ok. 15 minutes later asked for water again. I had to ask 3 times to get it. After finished 1 drink after sitting there for 45 mins, waitress comes over to ask if need refill, she never put the appetizer in. I waited 45 minutes thinking it is taking this long to cook my special dish. She never put it in but does not apologize. How deaf can you be?!!! I even asked to make sure the ingredients in the dish is what I wanted. Worse service ever!!! Waste of time & money!! I want to give a zero for my rating. It's so damn humid outside & no water. Imagine how that feels."}
{"text":"Yum! Great service and even better food. Diverse menu with a generous host of daily specials. Warm goat cheese salad was superb. Pulled pork BBQ excellent as well...fries and salad served with most sandwiches which I appreciated. Great atmosphere, fresh air and plenty to look at on the walls with all the artwork. I will return! Good selection of draft beers, was happy to find Carlsberg and Guinness."}
{"text":"Mon premier pub au quebec (donc ça marque) première pinte une belle gueule, une joli brune rafraîchissante (oui je parle de la bière).
Large choix de bière exotique (oui pour moi elles le sont), on peut y manger, gringnoter, diner
Essayer le burger maison pour 13 $ CAD
Service impec, serveuse mignonne ;-)


 Ps : ils ont du RICHARD :-D

{"text":"We stopped in at noon on a Tuesday expecting to easily get a table. Nope! It was packed! 3 of us sat at the bar by the door which was totally fine. I ordered the veggie burger, and my party ordered a French onion soup, and a beef burger. Everyone loved their food, and we would definitely return next time we're in Montreal. Really great efficient service as well."}
{"text":"I am disappointed in this place, the Hyatt recommended we try it, however everything we ordered, except for the fries was sub-par and the service was beyond lackluster. The Chicken burger was dry, the salad was vinegary, But the fries were amazing! The servers lacked follow through - they seat you and dont come back to take a drink order until a half hour later; they do the same for food - they drop the plate and then run away. 

We were trying to hail down our server to get a glass of water, but getting her attention was a task all of it own. When we asked if the chicken burger was supposed to be that dry she replied no and walked away.  

Go there for the fries, that seems to be the only thing they do right."}
{"text":"Busy place for a Tuesday night, but the service was fast, food was delish and I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Tuesday night in the middle of Juste pour Rire. Place was pretty busy but we were served drinks right away.  Appetizer arrived quickly.  The Brie was excellent and the Belle Geulle pilsner was tasty.  Main course took a little longer to arrive than we expected -- between 30 and 45 mins.  I had the duck confit salad.  Wife had the fish and chips.  Both were well above average.  In fact, the fish and chips might have been the best I've had.  The batter was light and flavourful and the fish was thick and flaky.   Plus the extra green salad on the plate was a nice bonus.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Visiting from Ontario, found good food, reasonable prices and friendly staff. Recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently visited Montreal for the first time. We set out to discover the shopping of St. Catherine's street. About halfway down we began to get hungry and wanted to eat lunch and grab some pints and began reading menus outside restaurants. This menu grabbed our attention the most and the beer selection was unmatched in the area. 

They even have some of their own micro brews on tap. My wife got a cider she kept calling the Michael Jordan cider and she loved it. I went with some of the McLauren brews I think they were called and enjoyed those as well. 

We got here about 11:30AM and the crowd was minimal. She asked if we had reservations and we said no, we were just visiting and dropped in. I was curious why they would need reservations, but as we sat there drinking waiting on our food I quickly realized why. Right after noon, the place filled up elbow to elbow. It was clear this was a good place to eat for the locals during lunch hour. 

I ordered the fish and chips, and it was honestly the best fish and chips I had ever eaten before. I have had that dish over 100 times and seriously this was the best way I had ever experienced it. My wife got the Philly cheese steak burger, and she was not as impressed with her choice. It did not look like what we experience in the US as the standard, it was more chopped looking and almost tasted and resembled BBQ. She did enjoy it, she just mentioned she would not order that again. 

I had heard such good things about the micro brews they had on tap there, I was hoping we would get a chance to stop back by there at night for some drinks, but our time didn't allow for it. I definitely recommend stopping here though if you are in the area, you won't regret it even though it is on the pricier side, but what isn't in downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"Get the duck poutine! It's one of the best dishes I've had in the city with a full roasted duck leg on top for you to shred. The fish and chips were also pretty good. Staff was friendly and it's just got some nice atmosphere. Decent beer list too and my first Fin du Monde after landing! This is a great little bar and restaurant I'd gladly return to whenever in the area."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Montreal, I was so pooped by 8:30 pm that I was ready for bed. But then I slapped myself in the face and said, \"It is 8:30! Get out of bed and explore the city, you fool.\" So I wandered down Rue St-Catherine close to Chinatown and found Nyk's (or maybe it is just Nyks). It was quite dark and wooden inside, but the volume of the music was just right and there was a good mix of clientele (old ladies having a slice of cake on the terrasse and a gaggle of kids who could be no older than 18 by the bar). I ordered a half pint of the Coup de Grisou from Cheval Blanc, a very yeasty, fruity beer served with a lime. The escargots on the menu were good, but I wouldn't have even known I was eating snails since the dish was smothered with a thick layer of melted cheese (maybe this is the norm, I have never eaten escargots in Montreal before). The rest of the menu is typical bistro fare, and the kitchen seems to stay open until pretty late.

Don't go for the view though. There is some major construction going on across the street (might have something to do with the Film Festival)."}
{"text":"A very good, laid back place for a meal and a beer or two.

I got the steak frites and several cold local beers.  The steak was juicy and perfectly cooked to order.  The fries were nice and crisp on the outside and had a perfect texture on the inside.

It was a beautiful sunny late afternoon when I ate there.  I occupied a table right next to a huge window that was open and letting in the gorgeous weather and a nice view of downtown.

The waitress that took care of me was very nice.  When it came time to settle up, a young man helped me.  I don't know if this is just a difference between Canada and the US, but he made sure to remind us to tip before he even gave me my change.  Maybe he has been stiffed on the tip a bunch of times.... but it was off-putting.  

Recommend!!"}
{"text":"Nice little pub downtown. I like it because it is somewhat hidden  .... I mean not surrounded by a bunch of other bars. On Saturday night, you can hope to be seated right away around dinner time. Not the typical pub food, way more eatable."}
{"text":"Ended up here two out of our three nights of vacation in Montreal. It was down the street from where we were staying and had the largest beer list I could find in the immediate area. 
We ate here one night and it was good, pretty standard bar food with French additions. The other time we just drank at the bar. The local beers were great and the waiters were very friendly and helpful, even let me practice the few words of French I know and gave us advice on other places to go in the city. Will come back next time for sure, would totally hang out here if we lived in Montreal!"}
{"text":"They have a nice outside seating area when it is warm, however it was full when we went so we sat at the bar.  Nice decor inside and has a cool feel.  We did not eat only came in for a drink, however the menu looked amazing.  
  The wine list is decent and the pours are hefty.  They have good beer on tap and you can get a big pint."}
{"text":"NYKS is a very solid pub if you are looking for good food, local beer, and a relaxed environment.  I stopped in last week with a couple of coworkers because we were looking for some dinner and beer within walking distance of our hotel.  NYKS seemed like a good fit and we were happy with the experience.

The service was probably more like three stars; they forgot our appetizer and were a little slower than I would have liked but we weren't in a rush so this wasn't an issue.  I wasn't too hungry so I just ordered a French Onion Soup but that was very good.  The local beers were also good and the selection was decent.

I won't say that there was anything that blew me away, but it is exactly what we were looking for and I would happily go back again."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Food was average and very limited menu. Beer selection was good. With so many restaurants in Montreal this isn't one we would return to."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why everyone gives a 4-5 start to this place. They have a poor beer selection, the food is not great. My friend had a duck salad and felt sick the whole night. We had a pulled pork burger and it was ok.... expected better for the reviews this place has. The ambience is also okish mostly ppl of 40 and up. Go someplace else if you can."}
{"text":"The drinks are great, the food is delicious, and it's a great place for dates or for just hanging with your friends."}
{"text":"Nyk's is our favourite place in Montreal.  Not just because it is down the street from where we live and is at a great location, but because the food is great, the beer is cold and the owners are super cool. 

Everything we have ever had on the menu has been spot on (I've eaten there maybe 20 times).  Try their soups, they are some of the best I've ever had.  They also have homemade sausage on the menu that is awesome.

They always have specials on their chalkboard that usually feature something unusual (I've seen kangaroo, deer and bison).  They also usually have a fish or other seafood special  on tap (this summer they have had mussels quite a few times).  

Nyk's is also a great spot to hang out and people watch - it's right off St Catherine where the street is blocked off for the various summer festivals so there are tons of \"interesting\" people to see.  In the summer they have the outdoor sidewalk patio open and the large doors to the inside open.  In the winter you can hang out inside and watch the Habs on the bar TV. 

They have a good variety of Quebec and World beer on tap and a full bar as well and have 5@7 specials.

Did I mention the owners being cool?  They are - I usually have my favourite beer on my table before I even sit down.  They take the time to ask how you are doing and make sure you are having a great experience.  It's like hanging out at a friend's house who is an awesome cook and has lots of beer taps!  Go once to try it and then go back to just hang out."}
{"text":"Nice, little pub with a great variety of beers and food beyong regular pub food. Actually, the food menu features a small list of well chosen starters and entrees which are closer to a regular restaurants food than pubfood.
Nevertheless, I had Fish&Chips with fried and salad. This thing is a real huge portion with two large pieces of fish, some fries and a lot of green salad. The salad was lacking a little dressing which is the only thing to complain about."}
{"text":"I came here with 3 other people. First of all, the waitress wasn't the nicest person but i usually don't care if she does her job right. We ordered our food and beer, the drinks got there right away but the food was taking a really long time. About 40 mm go by and still no food and no waitress in sight since we got our beer. ( we ordered burgers and poutine) We finally find her and call her over, after asking about our food, she acts like nothing is wrong. We finally get our food, and yet again, our waitress disappears and never comes back. Later, when some of the party was done eating, instead of waiting for everyone to be done, someone had started clearing the plates. When it came time to pay, I had to get up to ask for our check. On top of this long wait and lack of service, another waitress kept reaching over our table to serve people next to us because they were too lazy to walk around to the other side. This making it very uncomfortable when you're trying to eat but someone's body is constantly hovering over your head. The food was good but since the service was horrible I don't think I'll come back."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for an early dinner because it had good reviews. The food was below average. We had warm Brie which was good and mussels that didn't have much taste. Service wasn't great either. The beer was ok. Skip."}
{"text":"Why oh why did I not get the duck confit poutine?  Seriously, ordered the mussels, which were good, but didn't hold a candle to my sister's poutine. 

I may go back, like now. 

To expand, excellent burger selection, including ostrich, and a few different tartares. Local beers on draft and in bottle. Lovely atmosphere and very friendly staff.  

But honestly, the duck confit poutine is just ridiculous."}
{"text":"Super rude. They acted like they didn't see me standing there waiting....and waiting....
When I tried to ask if it was ok to sit anywhere, the lady rudely said, \"just wait a second. Wait a second!\"

I had been waiting."}
{"text":"Had dinner here our first evening in Montreal, at the suggestion of hotel staff. My husband ordered mussels and loved them. (He proclaimed he was only going to eat seafood for the remainder of our stay in Montreal!) His pommes frites were fantastic-- I probably scarfed down 2/3 of them, and I ordered the confit de canard after spotting it being served to a diner at the next table; it restored my faith in duck. The service was very good, despite the fact that the tiny pub was absolutely packed, and they appeared to have only two servers. It was a very good recommendation."}
{"text":"Just absolutely shocked by local yelpers. 4/5 stars? Maybe not enough people judged the food? I wanted straight up pub food & good beer. The McAuslan cream ale beer gets the star. Clean taps. Smooth tasty, cold pint. I play it safe (I think) and order their classic burger with sautéed onions with the $1 add on cornichons & $1 Gruyere. The beer arrives in 5 minutes (thankfully) the burger comes with fries & salad...after a good 30 minutes. The salad is coated in flavorless oil & nothing more. The fries are dark & soggy with oil and no more than room temperature. Disappointing. The burger does not land within the definition beyond its shape. It is a flavorless, thin, overcooked disc with softened (not melted) Gruyere, raw (not the promised carmelized) onions and pickles. Had I used the burger as a doorstop & only eaten the pickles & bun, I likely would have been more satisfied. 

Verdict: If you visit, just have beer. They don't serve food...really."}
{"text":"I only stopped in with a friend while walking her home to her hotel. We had a couple of pints and a long chat. Our waitress was very kind and respectful and the restaurant has a great, peaceful atmosphere in the evening. It's mostly a meat menu but I'll be sure to come back and experience more of what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful staff. And although the food menu is limited, the quality is excellent!"}
{"text":"C'est devenu mon endroit par défaut au centre-ville. Bien situé près de la Place des festivals, il s'agit d'une bonne alternative des autres restos du quartiers plus coûteux. Menu style bistro toujours constant, staff très rapide et cordial. La table d'hôte du midi est toujours très varié.

Astuce : il faut réserver le midi."}
{"text":"I'm giving three stars, because the server was nice. Not veggie friendly. Had the worst veggie burger, ever! My friend had the steak and said it was delicious. Very small and noisy. In the summer it's right in the centre of the festivals, very busy!! Montreal has so many great bistros, this is not one of them."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here for a drink (or two) during Jazz Fest. The service was great and the drinks were delicious. There is nothing better than day drinking and watching the world walk by."}
{"text":"After reading reviews on this place I was really excited to try their food, but everything was a disappointment...except their fries. 

I ordered the homemade pork and leek sausages with fries and green salad. The sausage tasted okay, but the texture was a bit too dry. I didn't like the salad dressing at all, so I couldn't even eat my salad. The fries were the best part....my 3 friends had finished eating and their plates had been cleared away already while I was finishing my fries. I went to grab the mayo but that had been cleared away too....umm excuse me waiter, I'm still eating, can I have the mayo back please. 

I tried bites of my friends' meals as well an this is what I found... Pulled pork burger was too dry. Fish and chips really didn't have much flavor, but was very tender. Warm goat cheese with spinach and tomatoes was really just that: goat cheese, spinach, and tomatoes with nothing else. There was a lot of goat cheese compared to the amount of spinach and tomato, so if you order this, make sure you really like goat cheese. 

I also found the portions were a bit small for the price. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Service rapide et très bonne qualité de bières et de plats ! L'accueil est chaleureux et le cocktail à la rhubarbe est dingue ! Bon pub à conseiller"}
{"text":"This place had tasty, juicy burgers with some nice herb action going on, along with fresh toppings and a tasty toasted bun. We also loved the fries, which were different than typical. Sangria to go with was nice and citrusy. Service was friendly if a little slow."}
{"text":"If I'm out of ideas and don't want to go through the fuss of picking a pub, I'll probably go with Nyks.

I came to grab a bite to eat the first time I came here. We sat at the bar and the bartender recommended a coffee tasting drink for me (don't remember the name but apparently it's a recipe exclusive to the place. The food was nothing spectacular but the cocktail was pretty memorable.

The second time I came on a very late night. There was barely anyone here. I asked the staff if they took music requests and they ended up play my song. Had a great time jamming out to the music!  Probably the most friendly and chilled staff I've encountered so far!"}
{"text":"Okay.. I'm a global traveller so yes I do keep it objective and in context.  This treasure off of St Catherine's is 5 star period.  
 
The food could easily be 5 star US restaurant , but it's a lively packed open air , music scene.  

Love it, made friends. Had drinks and the award winning pulled pork poutine.. , cognac. I was in heaven for hours.  Staff is top notch , work hard and it's the best of St Catherine's. 

Go here ask for Sabrina, Ricardo, and tell them you want the best.  Their night be a wait and this is not a quiet sit down. It's fun and happy. Go!"}
{"text":"Such a cute spot! Just in town visiting so I missed the food which I am sure is amazing. Our bartender was so awesome and helpful and so attentive. The atmosphere is A1 and the artwork on the walls is dopeeee. Highly recommend. :)"}
{"text":"In town for business. This place is really nice. Manager and bartender took good care of us. Beer list is really varied and the food menu also had a lot of good selections. I had the swordfish special which was really flavorful and cooked perfectly. It got busy after 10, but there was still room at the bar to enjoy our beers."}
{"text":"I am rating this place PURELY on their vegetarian dish. I had a veggie burger and I cannot even tell you if it had any flavor. I doused it in the several condiments provided but I cannot say if there was any flavor to begin with. The beer was great and it seems to be a very popular spot, but not a very tasty vegetarian place."}
{"text":"Perfect lunch spot for us. Open windows and door. Lovely day. Shared the must have pulled pork poutine and a spinach salad with lovely goat chews and added grilled chicken. Only reason not 5 stars is once food arrived, waitress never came back to check. Would have ordered another beverage or water."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere at this place. It's a great place to stop in and have a drink and a quick bite to eat. The service was quick as well, even though they had a huge group of people they were waiting on as well. I tried the pulled pork poutine and loved every bite of it!"}
{"text":"This pub was by far the most consistently crowded place around the jazz festival area in Montreal. My friend and I wanted to go where the locals looked like they were, and this seemed like the place to be. We sat at the bar and was immediately served drinks. I love the atmosphere- really casual, great music, lots of people and great service. They speak both English and French, and the menu was in both languages as well. I ordered the poutine with grilled chicken and it was absolutely delicious. The fries were cooked perfectly, the gravy had fois-gras and was so tasty, and I loved the cheese curds and chicken. Not too heavy and rich- it made for a great satisfying dinner. I was really happy with this place and would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"We came upon this pub walking from the fine arts museum back to our hotel in Old Montreal.  Nyks had the feel of a little European pub.  There are tables outside, and in warmer months the restaurant opens up to the outside by a large overhead door.  The young gentleman who greeted us and served us was friendly and provided very good service even though he was both bartender and server. The pub offers free wifi, just ask for the username and password.  We ordered the classic Poutine to share, which was good with a wonderful rich gravy. The sundried tomato, olive and basil tapenade was tasty and served with a small basket of bread. The bread was not enough for the generous portion of tapenade, but more bread was brought to us upon request. I liked the atmosphere of the pub very much and the friendliness of the gentleman who served us. I recommend stopping here for a pint and a poutine."}
{"text":"One of my fav places in Montreal, excellent beers and food at reasonable prices! Please open on a Sunday?"}
{"text":"Went while in Montreal on vacation.  Atmosphere is thoroughly Bostonian (if that's a thing)... dim lights... warm bar... good beer selection... and not bad food either.  A solid choice for a bite to eat if you aren't looking for fancy-pants cuisine.

Met a few local guys who work nearby at the theatres/perf arts center... and it just seems like a nice group of staff/regulars.

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Was in Laval for a wedding and had a couple hours to spare so I decided to go into the city. Walking through Place Des Arts, I wanted some quick snacks and a beer and decided to try this place. Friday early evening and it was starting to get loud and packed. Staff nevertheless were very friendly and helpful. I had the fried calamari which was delicious and the spicy mayo is what got me hooked. I also had the regular poutine which was decent, nothing great. After reading other reviews, I guess I should have gotten the pulled pork poutine but what are you gonna do?"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place while sight seeing on Rue Ste-Catherine. The service was absolutely fantastic!  They have their local brews. We had their famous poutine fries with chicken added. The gravy was great!!!!  Reasonable prices and large portions."}
{"text":"Toujours excellent quand j'y suis allé, c'est une valeur sûre pour un bon burger. Comme c'est populaire, il faut par contre être parfois patient pour avoir une place."}
{"text":"This is officially my favorite place in Montréal.  I've been in the city on a business trip for the better part of the week and have eaten here three times.  As a solo vegetarian diner with a mild case of social anxiety, it is sometimes difficult for me to find a place where I really feel at home when I'm, well, not at home.  The staff at Nyks are incredibly friendly, funny, and laid back, the atmosphere is cheerful and warm, and the food and beer selection cannot be beat.  They have several on-tap local microbrews and the veggie burger and salads are out of sight, although I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place to die-hard foodies, but I will say this: during my time in Montréal, I have spent hours reading at the bar and have never once felt awkward or out of place and I always leave full and happy.  I love it!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings in regards to this place. It isn't amazing but it isn't crappy either. I like it but don't love it. It's ok but I don't hate it. 

What I do like is that it's a good pub atmosphere to hang out and have some drinks. I ordered a burger which I wasn't satisfied with, but the drinks were good and the brie cheese platter we took home was great. Plus they were playing 80's music which made me very, very, happy. My friend had the mussels which were yummy. Location was ideal and near our hotel so we didn't have to worry about taking a taxi/Uber back too.

Other than that, it was fine, which probably should've given it a lower/higher rating? I'm not sure. Staff was ok, but I felt something was missing. Maybe I was more impressed with the music choices than the food which isn't necessarily a good sign. So..B-."}
{"text":"We are in Montreal working a conference and another attendee recommended Nyks.  After a 13 hour day on our feet we trudged there from our hotel.  Once in, we knew we were in the right place.  Seated in a cozy booth with drinks delivered quickly we perused the menu.  Everything ordered was great, but to us the standout was the fish and chips - what do they do to make cod so good?  Drinks were well done and service just right.  If I lived here this would be my go to pub."}
{"text":"Right off the bat I was impressed.  This place has their S together!!!  Drinks, food, and perfect service!  They certainly know how to mix a drink with a good ole punch to it.  The menu wasn't anything special, but what was ordered was delicious!  I can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Walked here one evening during our vacation. We got seated quickly then waited about 15 minutes for someone to attend us.  Food was ok.  I had the special bison burger with cheddar.  I've noticed that Canadian restaurants seem to use Kraft singles (Canadian equivalent?).  Burger was over cooked and fries tasted a bit burned.  I had a pilsener which was ok then an IPA which was much better.  Husband had poutine which he really liked - not to my liking, but that's not the fault of the restaurant.  Waiter was nice when we could get his attention- on bright side we weren't rushed out quickly.  All in all it was a fine restaurant but not some place I'd rush back to."}
{"text":"Good stop for a beer. The decor is super cute adorned with large gears by the door. It has a nice outdoor patio space. The service was great and they speak English well. Would come back to try the food."}
{"text":"We actually found this pub while looking for another restaurant that turned out to be a reservation only place. It was snowing, and we were so hungry that we pretty much came into the first place that had available sitting. I know this isn't the best way to find a new place to eat, but we didn't realize that at night time (even on weekdays) you pretty much need a reservation anywhere in Montreal. I'm guessing is the cold and the fact that there isn't much more to do than to go out and eat. 
Anywho, we came in and this place is very small and crowded, we were lucky a party of two just vacated a table so we were able to stay. This place had their own brews, but could not be considered a brewery per se. We asked the waitress to recommend something that wasn't dark or IPA. She brought a pale ale and it was very good. We also decided to try the famous \"Poutine\" which is the only Canadian thing we could discern. It's just some fries with gravy and some kind of queso fresco type cheese. They do have different flavors but we went with the original. It was OK, hit the spot when it's cold, but it's not something I would eat often. They did have some entrees, besides the typical bar food. I had a blackened chicken with salad, and the hubby had a pulled pork sandwich. It was very good. I saw another table had ordered French onion soup, which looked amazing, but I was full by then. I would have definitely tried that.

Service was great, even though the place was brimming with people and there was hardly any space to walk between the tables, out waitress came ofter to check on us, even the manager (or I assume was the manager) came by to ask how we were doing. Overall a great place, a little loud, but it was OK. I liked everything I had and the service was great."}
{"text":"This is slowly becoming a popular date night spot for me. I feel like some of the staff are point blank rude, and some are extremely cordial. 
I hate that the appetizers here are over priced and tiny. We ordered the chorizo and corn fries, I honestly think sharing an appetizer is almost impossible here. 

I would recommend this place because I think they have the best cider and the location is really nice. Its a fun touristy place with good main course."}
{"text":"We didn't eat here, but had some terrific beers and the menu looked really good. Service was great but understaffed as the day got busier. Definitely a good choice to stop in after walking around doing the tourist thing all day."}
{"text":"Randomly stumbled on this place after getting lost with a friend looking for Thai express. Man - thank goodness. Great menu at reasonable prices. 

Walking location from anywhere central. 

But be warned (which I prefer) lots of locals. 

The service was amazing. Food was fantastic. Drink selection was wide as well. 

Overall had a great experience and would definitely come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Great bar in Montreal.  4 stars because we didn't eat as it was late, but Emily was a gracious host and mixed wonderful drinks.  Very nice spot to enjoy libations.  Will try the food soon when we get here earlier and possibly upgrade to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Nice selection of beers! It was very crowdy and full but we managed to have a place at the bar. Service was very fast and accurate even with so many clients"}
{"text":"This place keeps saving my life downtown when all I want is good food, a pint, a whisky, an intimate talk with good friends... Somewhere dim and prettily lit with friendly service who don't mind your mellow pace or if you're making inexpensive moves. It's small, and not cheap but not over priced, fully bilingual, bathrooms are downstairs and awfully close to the kitchen, but otherwise tasteful. In this area it's nice to tuck off St Cat's into a place that's not a chain, not a scene, nice looking enough to feel like your life is unfolding beautifully with choices that aren't too bad at all."}
{"text":"Had a great time grabbing drinks at NYKS last night. Great on tap beer selection and quality mixed drinks. The staff was also prompt and friendly. Only draw back is limited space inside. There is a wonderful atmosphere, but limited bar space, so be prepared to be cozy if you're just sitting at the bar and not at a table."}
{"text":"Petit dîner à l'heure du midi. Nous avons appelé vers 10:30 un vendredi pour une réservation pour 8 le jour même à midi. À notre arrivée la table était prête. Le service est courtois et rapide. Le restaurant n'est pas très grand, de style bistro. Le menu est varié et il y a une table d'hôte sur l'ardoise. J'ai commandé le tartare de saumon en table d'hôte. Il vient accompagner d'une soupe en entrée, le plat principale d'une salade du chef et de frites. La soupe minestrone était un peu fade, je ne l'ai pas terminé. La salade était fade. Le saumon était frais mais goûtait seulement les oignons verts. Il n'y avait pas vraiment d'épices. je mange rarement des tartares alors j'étais très déçue, je n'ai pas terminé mon plat. Les frites étaient bonne. Ma collègue a commandé un espresso qu'elle a détesté et n'a pas terminé. J'y retournerais pour essayer autre chose,  car les autres semblaient satisfaits de leur plat (hamburgers, saucisses et fish n' chips). Pour ma part, tartare à éviter."}
{"text":"Outstanding service in a busy neighborhood pub. There are several daily specials on the chalk board along with wines and brews that extend the menu choices. We had the vege couscous curry and the beef cheeks special.  Both were well prepared and delicious. The chocolate soufflé was exquisite!  Crowded and noisy but not deafening on a Saturday night. Worth trying for sure."}
{"text":"We were recently in town for a few days and happens by NYK's... and boy were we happy we did. Everything we had was fantastic... the baked Brie is just something you have to order, as are the house made sausages. The atmosphere was great and the wait staff friendly."}
{"text":"This is a pub with great drinks, cool servers and amazing quality food.  I came here recently for a friends birthday and had a great night.  The bartenders know how to make a proper drink.  I asked for a light, yet tasty shot and I was brought these really cool blue shots topped with baileys.  I think she called them \"bubble gum\" shots.  They were great.  I believe when a bartender has the ability to read your mind on what you want even though you give a very vague description, she is an elite!  The food here is surprisingly better than you can expect.  Pay attention to daily specials, they are usually really good.  I have been here a few times and it never disappoints.  Will be back... OFTEN"}
{"text":"love this place!
 As with most things Quebecois: They have their own \"take\" on simple foods/concepts. A Philly Cheesesteak is pretty straight forward. They have their own take on that, as a Burger @ Nyks. My Wife didn't partiuclarly like it, as she was expecting something else (ie. a Philly-Style, on a Burger Bun). 
 Great selection of beer...House Burger is done really, really well. Best Hamburger I've had in Montreal. Great selection of local beers, moderately priced...great atmosphere. 
 No complaints. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went here late, only 5 minutes until the kitchen closed; was a bit worried but had one of the best meals I had in Montreal while there for work. I will go back when in town - was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was, service was outstanding and drinks were great. Nice selection too! Thanks for a great meal."}
{"text":"Went there with a few friends and didn`t have reservations. We waited like 10-15 mins for a group to finish up and we were good to go. I got the lamb sausages which were pretty good, bit of an acquired taste but I expected that. Pricing is reasonable. 

The place is pretty small with a small terrace but it`s very open, so you don`t feel like you have claustrophobia. 

One of friend got the veggie burger, she gave me a bite and it was surprisingly delicious! Another friend got the duck poutine which I tasted as well. It was also really good. My other friend got the bison which I think was one of the specials, he said it was good but a bit too tough. I never had Bison but I guess it would be tough, not sure. 

Everyone enjoyed themselves and the waiter provided great service. I`d go back."}
{"text":"If you want an authentic Montreal experience, then definitely come here! I had a day to myself and ended up having a delicious meal of the original Poutine as well as a very flavourful local beer. I'd highly recommend this spot! Anglais/Francais aussi."}
{"text":"My visits to Nyks are sporadic and they occur approximately once a year in conjunction of some of the numerous festivals organized in the Quartier des spectacles. The pub provides a safety net against near by chain restaurants or new unknown establishments, it is always a pleasure to submerge in its noisy atmosphere or just grab a pint at the tiny outdoor tables. During the summer the windows are wide opened and one can have a nice terrace feeling. The menu of Nyks is small, but well considered to satisfy everybody's taste. The olives and dry tomatoes tapenade as an example is a perfect snack that can be even shared and I got exactly what I needed with my simple green salad with carrots during my last visit. One of my friends shared a lot of good words about the pulled pork burger. Nyks deserves special Bravo for the bourbon infused Bloody Caesar, it is spicy, but good spicy. They will serve you little cute carafe of sangria if you have cravings for it. The beer list is wonderful, classical imported and bunch of local craft brews on tap. Ended up drinking pint or two of Coup de Grisou last week, second Bravo for the pub. Don't hesitate if you are in the area and really wondering where to have a drink or bite, Nyks will deliver."}
{"text":"Came in late on a Friday for some drinks. My Cosmo did not have alcohol in it. Isn't that a pretty common drink with a pretty common recipe? I thought so. Moving on."}
{"text":"Très bon endroit pour diner. Le service est rapide et la qualité de la carte est surprenante. Beaucoup d'achalandage surtout à l'heure du lunch. Très populaire chez les gens branchés du Centre-Ville."}
{"text":"I've only been to NYK.S two times, and I had the onion soup both times.  It was to DIE for, so delicious.  Honestly I think it's the best onion soup I've ever had in Montreal. 

We were there for drinks only and my friend and I had the onion soup.  We were enjoying it so much that our other two friends could not resist but to order the onion soup as well."}
{"text":"Great location for pre show. Nice vibe. Fine drink menu. Maybe the worst hamburger I have ever had in my life. Barely ate half."}
{"text":"Great place to meet up after work. Busy on a Friday evening. Nice portions. Lots of beer, wine, and spirit options. Kinda in the loud side. Al fresco dining with garage doors open to street.  Nice variety of pub food in the menu."}
{"text":"J'adore ce bistro que des amis Yelpeurs m'ont fait découvrir un soir avant le cinéma. Situé en plein centre-ville sur la rue Bleury, cette place offre une belle diversité, autant pour les consommations alcooliques que pour son menu de qualité. Le choix des plats proposés en table d'hôte (une dizaine en tout) varie à chaque soir, ce qui permet au chef de vous cuisiner une bouffe pleine de fraicheur. 

À ma première visite, j'ai choisi le steak de thon saisi aux sésames. Un délice. Le thon était cuit comme je l'aime (encore rouge au centre mais grillé en surface) et l'assaisonnement aux sésames était bien balancé. Les accompagnements de légumes grillés étaient eux aussi très réussis. La deuxième fois, j'ai dégusté une bavette de cerf avec salade en accompagnement. Là encore, très réussit. Le choix des vins est très correcte quoique un peu limité (j'enlève une étoile). Le service est courtois, rapide et sympathique. 

En bref, le Nyks est l'endroit parfait pour bien boire et manger dans le centre-ville si on désire éviter les places un peu guindées. L'endroit peut devenir bruyant les soirs de fin de semaine, mais tant pis, ça donne de l'ambiance. Je recommande fortement."}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips after a long day of traveling. Great little pub that opens to the street. Nice beer selection, friendly and warm staff. A nice pub- you should stop in."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and I will keep coming back.  It is a lively place that spills out onto the street in the summer.   It is worth paying attention to the special board.   I have had amazing, duck, rabbit and seafood specials at a really fair price.

The fish and chips are the best I have had in the city.   The only flaw I have come across is the burgers.  They tend to be dry.   Other than that, it would be five stars."}
{"text":"Cool, local, hipster place.  They were able to accommodate our party of 8. Atmosphere was great, the service was a little slow and scattered, and the food was generally ok.  The melted Brie appetizer was the hit of the night.  The fried calamari was standard. The steak-frites was cooked perfectly for me (Medium) - daughter ordered medium-well and it was just not ... good.  The cod escabeche was ok, The linguine in mushroom sauce was a thumbs down from my son-kind of \"dry\". The Poutine was ok, but the cheese didn't melt but that's probably because we asked for the gravy on the side.  Wine was small, but the beers were big. Go with the beer."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly servers, just a great feel to the place. It was very crowded when we went for an early dinner on a Friday, so I take that as a good sign. We had a yummy warm Brie with pears and classic poutine. Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Pricy and small portions, also, don't make the same mistake I made - don't get a burger outside of the US

 ¯\_(?)_/¯  

Other than that, it's worth 4 stars because the other food I got to try from friends was very tasty, the drinks were good, the interior is cool and hip, the service was pretty good for our large group.  I could see this being a happy hour or meet up for drinks with friends place."}
{"text":"Toujours à la hauteur pour un verre en bonne compagnie! Service courtois, prix raisonnable et excellent choix."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!! Pricing is good, service is both friendly and efficient and they have a great selection of alcoholic beverages (beers & cocktails!). We first called to make a reservation but the lady told us there was no place. We still decided to go just in case there would be cancelled reservations and a table would be free for us. We waited only a few minutes and we ended up at a table on the outdoor side. Just what we hoped for!!! I had mussels and fries and it was delicious. Mussels were really tasty and the portion of fries was generous. Really enjoyed this place!!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place first time on a Friday evening after work. Luckily we made reservations. It was very busy. We got seated at the bar. We ordered beers, wasn't super cold as you would want on a super hot day. The second drink was bourbon lemonade, it was delicious. I would totally recommend that if they still have it on the menu. For the main dishes, we ordered, the mergeze, linguini with mushrooms and Italian sausage. The three dishes were very well done and we were very happy with the quality vs price."}
{"text":"Je suis allé là pour la première fois et j'ai prit une bière et un scotch. Bonne sélection de bières et de scotch. Un peu dispendieux mais c'Est le standard du Centre-ville. J'ai bien aimé, bon service, carte de bouffe intéressante et pas trop dispendieuse."}
{"text":"What a lovely spot! My girlfriend and I were famished and popped in here on a Saturday night without a reservation...whoops...BUT they were extremely accommodating and sat us at the next available spot. We ordered food and drinks. I got the Oliver Twist, a refreshing cocktail, and my friend got a beer. Famished as we were, we ordered the Brie appetizer, poutine, and fish & chips... oh so healthy of us. Anyways food was great, service was fab - everyone was super nice."}
{"text":"Le bistro de choix après ou avant les festivaux estivale, les pintes de la micro brasserie trou du diable. Belle ambiance d'été à conseiller"}
{"text":"This was my first stop after arriving in Montreal.  A bit exhausted from being up early to catch the flight in from LA, I was craving a good ol' burger and beer, with a low-key atmosphere.  This fit the bill perfectly.  The decor is dark and wooden, and reminded me of a contemporary Irish pub meets classic bistro.  

Service is friendly and courteous (and  they helped with directions to my next stop later), but a tiny bit slow.  Although, I presume this to be because food is not just a means of calorie intake in Montreal.  It is to be enjoyed and relished. :)  Which I did.  The burger is cooked to a well-done (they don't ask how you want it prepared), and I got mine with Mozzarella cheese - and it already comes with grilled onions on a tasty bun.  It definitely hit all the right belly spots.  Paired with a local brew (hmm.. I forget the name and unable to find it on their website, but I believe it was a Molson pilsner?..  if that even makes sense).  The meal also comes with a green salad and fries.  Excellent!  I like how in Montreal, most meals come with either a salad or fruit - and not \"extra\".

Total was less than $20.  Good food, nice ambiance, cool location.  A pleasant introduction to my first night in Montreal."}
{"text":"This little pub is right on the edge of Montreal's entertainment district the Quartier des Spectacles. Nyks has a good assortment of beer and ales on tap as well as bottled beers in their under-counter refrigerators. They tend to specialize in Unibroue Beligian Style Ales from Tremblay which are imo world class brews but they also have other good local Quebec beers and ales too. I have yet to eat there but the food coming out of the kitchen has always been tempting and the presentation is absolutely eye catching. I ordered a McAuslan Cream Ale a local nitro-brew and was totally satisfied as I sat back to watch one of the most incredible bar-tending displays I have ever seen. Rick, the bartender, is a British expat married to a French Canadian living in Montreal now for some 12 years. Orders for drinks were all verbal from three waitresses and Rick never missed a beat, both hands always moving doing two things at one time all the time! My Son and I watched him for at least 30 minutes and were totally mesmerized by his skill level, adroitness and speed. If you wish to have a good beer or ale, Nyks should be on your list and for no other reason go to catch Rick you will be totally bedazzled as we were."}
{"text":"Vendredi 4 juillet 2014

Un beau vendredi en route vers un 5 à 7 avec une de mes cavalières de tango. Quoi de mieux chez Nyks Bistro. Ambiance très bruyante, très difficile de se parler en tête-à-tête, un service qui laisse à désirer, on nous oubli facilement pendant un bout de temps (je n'étais pas le seul à pointer sur cet élément durant la soirée...). Ne demandez pas de cocktails trop complexes, ils n'ont pas ce qu'il faut pour le faire. Le nombre de verres brisés par le barman est absolument impressionnant. On en compte facilement 5 aux 40 minutes ! Je commence donc avec un Pineau des Charentes sur glace. Le menu semble appétissant mais toutefois une grande réserve sur la supposée poutine au magret de canard. L'assiette arrive avec une cuisse de canard confit.... on est loin du magret. Il faut donc expliquer la différence. Le canard confit est cuit dans son gras et ensuite rôti. Il peut comporter n'importe quelle pièce mais en général on confit une cuisse de canard. Le magret est une poitrine de canard bien gras servit en tranches rosées et, en général, préalablement poêlé ou saisi. Point !

Une poutine au magret de canard doit donc être servi avec un magret .....car manger une cuisse sur des frites en sauce c'est plus que décevant. Au goût, c'est très différent, en texture c'est complètement le contraire. J'aurais voulu goûter un bon tartare de boeuf mais ils servent le tartare du moment : cette fois-ci le tartare de saumon, trop facile à faire. On peut mal évaluer les compétences du chef. On en sort avec une facture assez salée pour une maigre sortie. L'endroit est très bien décoré, très bien situé en plein centre-ville mais le tout s'est révélé très loin de toutes mes attentes.

Friday july 4th 2014

A nice friday on the road to a great after work time with one of my tango partners. Why not Nyks Bistro. The ambiance is loud and it's very hard to have a nice cosy conversation. You get forgotten from time to time by the waitress (i was not the only one pointing this out in the bistro). Don't ask for too complexe cocktails to prepare, they don't have what's needed. Broken glass very often by the barman, it's surprising, one every 8 minutes almost, it gets very irritating ! I start with a nice Pineau des Charentes on the rocks. The menu seems nice, I order a duck magret poutine. The plate arrives deceptively showing a duck leg as a basic confit. We are very far from the duck magret. The difference is not subtile. A confit is a piece of duck (usually the leg) cooked in duck fat then roasted, a magret is the duck's chest, very fat and rich, cooked in a pan or grilled and served in slices, medium-rare. That's it !

A poutine with duck magret has to bserved the correct way....eating a leg on fries and sauce is more deceiving to your taste buds. to the taste it's completely different and to the texture, it's night and day. I would have loved to try a nice beef tartare but they only had the \"tartare of the moment\": salmon tartare, too easy to do. You cannot evaluate the chef's hability that way. You come out of the place with a saltish taste on the bill for a small pleasure of the moment. The place is nicely decorated, very well situated downtown, but the ambiance is way far from I had in mind and what I was wainting for."}
{"text":"Nice place with a delicious sangria. They have small but super inviting terrace. The appetizers a overpriced, considering the size. Too small. 

The Basil and lemon grilled shrimps for example is 12$ and is basically a skewer with 4 shrimps. (But very tasty!). The duck with carrot confit is also delicious!

If you want something more substancial to start, try a main course, like the Homemade lamb merguez sausages (served with fries and green salad) and share it! 

The service is vey friendly and I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is solid beyond words. The food is great especially their duck confit poutine, which was amazing. The duck was tender, the fat was rendered (although some of it sat at the bottom of the dish). The fries were fried to perfection and the gravy was just what the whole entree needed. We also got the calamari which tasted fresh and was sizable. The fish and chips which were okay. And the pork sausage which was a bit disappointing - tasted a bit dry and overdone.

The service though was great. The ambience was fantastic - we went on a warm summer night and the doors and windows were opened up to the street. It really gave a laid back European vibe which we loved. People were in and out since this place is pretty popular. Would definitely come back for some wine/beer and some more eats."}
{"text":"On décide d'aller manger au NYKS, avant d'aller voir un spectacle places des arts, il y a du monde souvent un bon signe. On trouve une table pour 2 rapidement. On commence par prendre une bière, le service est rapide et le choix de bière/cocktail est assez varié mais rien d'exceptionnelle. On enchaîne ensuite par une entrée pour 2, tapenade olives/tomates, super bonne avec de bon morceau de pain (rare à Montréal ^^). On continue par 2 salade de canard confite, on retrouve une cuisse de canard confite et uniquement de la salade en grand quantité ..., honnêtement pour un plat à 18$ on s'attend à quelque chose de mieux, une salade composé (tomates, pignons ou autres) avec un canard désossé. Au final un repas à 65$ pour 2, avec un sentiment mitigé."}
{"text":"Waited awhile but it was jazz festival and they were rocking . Had drinks while waiting large portions ,very good . Worth the wait !!!During  Jazz festival a musical group passed by singing and dancing nice touch for this week"}
{"text":"Great pub with good food and lively atmosphere.
They had really good Moscow Mules, food was great, packed with people, super fun.
Came here with a group of girl friends as we were on vacation in Montreal.
I turned them in to Poutine for the first time, we decided to order a couple of different ones an Oh Poutine! its like crack!! so addictive.
Needless to say they all loved the poutine.

We each also ordered a different dish, i had the carpaccio di mango and it was very good. Food is fresh and great ambiance, what else you need?. Service was nice but slow and prices were a bit high, but we had so much fun!."}
{"text":"i really enjoyed our session of pre-gaming in montreal at nyks bistro pub. after walking around the city, and spying a dimly lit, inviting room, we saddled up to the bar and began ordering a whole bunch of beers that we had known only in the bottle back home. each beer came in its proper glass, which was a nice touch, and to boot we greatly enjoyed a little snack of escargot covered in melted mozzarella and accompanied with warm slices of baguette. if i had this bar at home, i would be a happy regular, and a good deal more relaxed on a friday night. the promise of good food, and beer served with a proper foam head is such a great thing, and a testament to the culture of montreal. kudos to you guys. i'm jealous."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you, this place is solid. Service wasn't bad despite the pub atmosphere, we did have to raise our hands a couple of times, but this is a pub, not a 5 star restaurant. The inside is cosy, and they are willing to help pack you in. The drinks are pretty reasonable as well

Started with the warm Brie as suggested by Yelp and it was as good as everyone says it is. The gf has the olive tapenade as her entree and it was also excellent; absolutely brilliant flavor, I thought it was close if not better than the Brie.

I had some kind of cod espenada or something like that ( soupy with vegetables) that had a sharp flavor but excellent in a way that made it disappear quickly. 

The sausages weren't too greasy and had great flavor, and the fish and chips dish was huge and disappeared faster than I ate my meal. The crab cakes looked frozen but I can forgive that considering the home cooked from scratch feel of everything else. 

The  Creme brûlée also seemed made from scratch and was excellent.

Overall the food was fantastic, the service was tolerable for a pub, and the atmosphere was cosy but pleasant. We will probably be back"}
{"text":"Good location and a nice pub atmosphere with outdoor seating.  Maudite  on tap makes me happy. Ordered the mussels and they were okay; Nothing to write home about.  If you are looking for a good pub with decent food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I'm visiting Montreal this weekend with my two nephews (ages 12 and 13) and chose Nyk's based on proximity to our hotel and reviews, and were not disappointed! We shared a poutine and it was quite good. I had a little salad with balsamic dressing that was yummy, although a tad overdressed.
For my entree I had pasta with mushrooms in a cream sauce. It was amazing. My nephews loved it too and ate half of it! We also got a calamari to share. Not the greatest....
Service was fast and friendly, atmosphere was fun and inviting and fine with the kids. Really a great meal!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. We went on a Thursday night without reservations and they were able to seat us at the bar right away. The restaurant is a tad small and tight for my taste, and it was very crowded. 

I found the menu to be a bit underwhelming. My friend and I ordered the polenta fries, warm Brie with poached pear, a french onion soup, and a veggie burger- all to share. The polenta fries were tasteless and not at all appetizing. The French onion soup was decent (not the best I've had but not the worst either), the veggie burger was just okay (also kind of bland), but the warm Brie with poached pear was phenomenal and the best part of our meal! 

If it wasn't for the warm Brie then I would say our meal would have been a total bust, but luckily the warm Brie dish redeemed our entire culinary experience at this place. The guy sitting next to me ordered the fish and chips and it looked good, but I would probably not be back. Plus there were little gnats/flies flying around the bar, total turn off."}
{"text":"Bruyant et chaleureux, service rapide, petit tapas disponibles, grands fenetres, petite terrasse ."}
{"text":"Indifferent bartenders, warm beer, slow service and mediocre at best. We were from out of town and did not feel comfortable at all."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant we visited during a trip to Montreal. The food and service was amazing. My friends and I all ordered different dishes and there wasn't one that disappointed. There's a nice selection of beer available and the atmosphere was very inviting, a warm and welcoming feel. The price was very appropriate considering the quality of food."}
