{"text":"I finally found a place that has thrifty ice cream.
And they have Hawaiian shaved ice. Great find and it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"When you first walk in you're welcomed which is always a plus. The guy I'm guessing the owner is so genuine. The ice cream sand which is so good and good size proportions. The sundae is also a good size and it's super delicious!!! The environment is small and cute also the prices are so reasonable and cheap. PLUS they have an Elvis Presley statue is always a win win situation."}
{"text":"What a Great place! I been looking for a Chill old fashioned ice cream place for a long time. And my search is over. Walked in and smelled so good... like a bakery. I believe they make their own waffle cones. I love the ice cream selection, shaved ice, And snack setup. I think Its a great location it makes the neighborhood feel brighter."}
{"text":"Was looking for Rocky Road Ice Cream, got a super hotdog to boot!  Clean, cute and very reasonably priced.  Great service!    Thanks"}
{"text":"Great little spot for your ice cream fix. Very reasonable prices and the scoops are generous. I'd never had Thrifty ice cream before but now I'm a definite convert. The shop is close to home and the service is very friendly and informative. The owner helped us out and was just pleasant and enthusiastic about being there. The selection is pretty large so you're sure to find a flavor, or combination of flavors, that you'll enjoy. There are spaces available for seating if you choose or grab a cone on the go.  I'll be returning often and I'd highly recommend you stop in as well. Coneheads does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Loved going here! Great atmosphere, & customer service. Amazing ice cream & snow cones!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thrifty ice cream. I haven't had thrifty ice cream since i was a kid. The man who served us (maybe the owner?) was super friendly and he even scooped my ice cream in a heart shape. The prices are super reasonable and the selection of ice cream was extensive (32 flavors). They also serve hot dogs which I didn't try but maybe next time :)"}
{"text":"Love this place ! Owner and lady working there are super friendly. There prices are really inexpensive ; cheap! And they have a great selection of ice cream!"}
{"text":"New little cute ice cream shop. The prices are very inexpensive and their ice cream selection is good. The owner (I am assuming) is very nice. We had a sundae and a cup of chocolate milk, $2.99 each. They also had snow cones and other tasty snacks. Don't forget to say hi to Elvis."}
{"text":"I love the variety of icecream flavors! The only bad thing is there are too many great choices so it is hard to make a decision!  Great prices, perfect for a family night out."}
{"text":"Very nice owner, But the ice cream wasn't very creamy & not a great location. It was very clean however. Review was based on product sold!"}
{"text":"The ONLY spot in the valley where you can find every flavor of thrifty's ice cream! Great spot, owner was very nice too. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"New \"ice cream and more\" spot in the neighborhood. Shaved ice, huge hot dogs and you can't beat Thrifty ice cream. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great ice cream shop! Super clean and lots of ice cream and shave ice choices. Also really affordable and the woman who helped us was friendly and kind. Glad to have a nice indoor/outdoor sit-down ice cream option in the area."}
{"text":"This place is a must! Anyone who grew up on Thrifty Ice Cream knows the power of a Triple Cone or the mear seduction of a Double. As kids we used to ride for miles to hit the Thrifty to indulge in our tasty treat. 


This ice cream is a flashback to childhood for me. The place is,very cute with some fun memorabilia on the walls. The owner is a ton of fun fun and treats Twyla like a princess.

I just like indulging in all of my favorite frosty treats. You can't miss here. They offer much more than ice cream. The ownership is fun and trying to build local patronage. Come and support! You will enjoy! Who doesn't like ice cream.

{"text":"Great service. Awesome! The owner served us. He even made a chocolate covered waffle cone for my son. I grew up in San Diego where there were Thrifty's stores. This is still the same great ice cream I remembered. Definitely a place to check out!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted ice cream and THIS PLACE HAS IT!!! Hug selection so who's up my way willing to grab some good ice cream with me?"}
{"text":"Very cute little ice cream shop! I drive up and down this street every single day and never noticed it back in the shopping center! Found it on yelp and since it was close by, decided to stop in for a cold treat on a hot day. My daughter really enjoyed the shaved iced; they allowed her to pick 3 flavors and they had tons of choices. Myself and my partner enjoyed the Thrifty's ice cream (rocky road, my fave! Also tried mint and chip and chocolate chip) with waffle cones. Loved the little heart shape ice cream scoop! Also would like to mention the woman working was super sweet and accommodating. Will definitely be back. Very reasonable pricing, three large sized delicious treats for only $10!"}
{"text":"We are happy that we found this ice cream shop!  The owner was very friendly and the ice cream is delicious.  A bonus that it's biking distance from our house"}
{"text":"This is a great little hidden gem to hunt down if you're in town.  Lucky for me I live only 10 minutes away 

Great price, great ice cream, cool owners and beats those mainstream ice cream shops.  

I had the milkshake and my family had the ice cream cones.  Milkshakes are amazing!"}
{"text":"Finally , a normal ice cream parlor!!! Just what we needed . Good prices n many choices in ice cream . The man at the counter is super friendly . We will be back ! (:"}
{"text":"Such a great place for deliciously simple ice cream! Thrifty's Ice Cream is absolutely the best kind there is and that's what this business serves! I usually go at night and the lady who always happens to be there is so nice and sweet! She's always got a great attitude! They serve coffee as well, hot dogs and I think nachos along with shaved ice and shakes. Check it out, it's a nice place to just hang out!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place! They have tons of flavors of thrifty ice cream and it's such a cute little place. Workers I have come across have been very friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great variety of ice cream flavors with amazing prices! I've been searching for a place that serves shaved ice! Plus the plastic container they put your cup in is so handy. Boyfriend got a shake and said it was amazing. Almost had it gone by the time we got home. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"My sister and I love this place! We come here often and the ice cream and customer service is amazing. The gentleman and lady who work here (and I assume own the place) are so so so nice. Happy to support this adorable local business."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found this place! Found Coneheads Thirfty Ice Cream on Groupon! We were immediately greeted by Elvis at the door! This place is about less than a year old and I hope it stays for years to come. The woman serving us was extremely patient, helpful and welcoming. I had my two small boys with me and of course one of them had to use the restroom during the middle of eating his ice cream! There's no public restroom in here but she was nice enough to let us use the employee restroom with no hesitation. She also changed the tv channel to Disney Jr for my boys as well as showed them how to play a new game. We will absolutely come back!"}
{"text":"Very neat clean place- come see Elvis! The BEST part about this establishment is the sincere kindness of owner Rick and extra touches added to ice cream like homemade waffle wafers. The ice cream flavors are AWESOME- try the cotton candy! The hot dogs are meaty with tasty flavor! This is a great place to treat yourself and the kids or to take a date. I would wholeheartedly reccomend this cute nostalgic ice cream shop!"}
