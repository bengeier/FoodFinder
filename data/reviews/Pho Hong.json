{"text":"Excellent service and delicious pho! Great broth and they put the raw beef on the side for my husband so he could cook it himself in the broth (the best way to do it!). The fried egg rolls were tasty, crisp and not at all soggy or greasy. Extremely clean restaurant, even including all the sauces on the little lazy susan on the table. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I used to live in San Diego and this place reminds me of the great Vietnamese restaurants on the west coast.  Their broth is legit and so good!"}
{"text":"We were bait and switched!  We ordered a large and regular sized pho, but received a regular and small pho.  When we received the order, I noticed the table next to us all ordered large bowls and received large bowls, but we received small and regular.  I asked the waitress and she said these are the large and regular sized bowls.  I then commented that the table next to us ordered large bowls and there bowls were twice the size of mine.  She then says that on the menu there is an option for X-large bowls; however when I looked at the menu again, there was no option for X-large bowls only large!  She lied to us.  Not only that, she charged us for a large and regular sized bowl when we did not receive them.  Also keep in mind I have been here before ordered a large bowl and they gave me the large bowl the other table had that was two times the size of my regular bowl.  Needless to say I will not be coming back.  Also Pho An Hoa on central ave. is way better in regards to flavor and price and they have larger sized bowls."}
{"text":"This was the worst pho place that I have ever ate at. First we walk in, no one was there to greet us,or sat us down. Bad customer service let you tell you that. The servers did not ask what we wanted to drink or are we ready to order. My husband and I waited while they took other peoples orders when we came in way before them. Worst fresh rolls EVERRRRR!!!! The rice paper was so hard and dried out I couldnt even eat it. Its like they made everything the night before and nothing was freshly made. Do not get boba tea there its the worst its so sweet and the tapioca in drink was so hard. First and last time going there."}
{"text":"Pho Hong is a new Vietnamese resturuarant in our neighborhood. Therefore, my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try Saturday night. We were blown away with both the quality and freshness of the food, and the friendliness of the staff.   We both ordered the Bun Combination on the recommendation of our server. The vegetables were fresh and the meat was cooked to perfection resulting in an absolutely amazing dish! We were so ecstatic with how good it was that we decided to return again tonight. Once again, this place did not disappoint. We are so excited to dine here again, and venture out to try some new dishes."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of places for pho but Pho Hong is the best so far. I come here any chance that I get for a bowl of pho."}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying I am not a \"pho\" expert, I know nothing about traditional Vietnamese food. I can say however, the food here is AMAZING!!!!! I had the pho with chicken and a mango bubba, and shrimp rolls in rice paper. Not sure the actual names for the stuff other than yumm, yummyer, and yummo. I got my pho, tossed in all the extras and some siracha and fish sauce and immediately went to soup heaven. It was spicy, and savory, and the fresh aromatics? Oh lord. The hubby is not a fan of foreign food, but his pork chops and rice? Not a bite left. And while the food was heavenly, our server managed to top that! She was friendly and helpful and frequently checked on us to make sure everything was great. All in all I will be back, with friends, with family, with my bigger pants!"}
{"text":"This is the best Pho in Charlotte! I found it last year, and have been going ever since. The owners are super cool, they already know what we want, where our favorite booth is and drink. The Chicken Pho is my favorite,  with lots of flavor then other Pho Noodle shops in Charlotte. Very clean, free Wifi, open late too."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte. Family owned and run, very good quality and consistent. After trying almost all the pho places in Charlotte, pho hong is the best in my opinion. The pho here is equal to LA and NYC."}
{"text":"Pho Yeah!! This really hit the spot! Hearty broth, fresh herbs, tender meat...recipe for creating a Regular Customer! Open 7 days a week & close to the job...I couldn't ask for more. Only open 5 months, good service, friendly & clean.  My Thai Tea was on point too!!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We have had pho at every place in Charlotte and this place, along with nearby Pho Hoa, is the best. The pho tastes amazing, the bubble tea is yummy, AND they have the best prices of any of the pho restaurants. Can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out since I heard it was new. The place is nice and clean and spacious. Typical Vietnamese restaurant with good selection of food on their menu and bubble tea. I had pho and couple of my friends had bun bo hue (spicy beef noodle soup). My pho broth was lack of flavor. The bun bo Hue is no where near authentic. Bun bo Hue broth was bland, but the spiciness level was good. Portion was small like very small compare to what we usually get. Our waitress was nice but she didn't remember to punch our side order that we asked her to. I would still come back and give it another try on other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service. Menu has a large selection to choose from and the prices are reasonable. It was my first time trying pho and this was the perfect place to go to. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was fairly dead on a Wednesday night when I brought one of my friends over to try what I read was authentic Vietnamese food.  What I like about Pho Hong is that they do indeed have a lot more dishes than say, Pho Hoa down the street, including dishes such as Bun Bo Hue and Bun Rieu.  They also have authentic Vietnamese desserts and drinks.  The restaurant is fairly large and is located in the same shopping center as Food Lion.  Plenty of parking all around.  One of the things that stood out the most to me here was not their food, but their friendly service.  Everyone at the restaurant, especially the waitress, which I assume might be one of the owners, was extremely friendly and always smiling.   As for the food, is it slightly more pricey than most Vietnamese I've had both in the South and in NYC.  A bun bo hue and bun rieu cost over $10 each bowl.  The bun rieu I had didn't have as much of the shrimpy/fishy flavor I was looking for and was way too salty.  The bun bo that my friend ordered tasted more like a pho with spicy sauce rather than a lemongass soup base.  That's not to say that the food was bad... I just came with high expectations given the many, many Vietnamese restaurants I've been to as well as my own personal past, growing up with a ton of Vietnamese friends in Georgia.  We had the goi cuon (shrimp summer rolls) to start and the ingredients were fresh and the rice paper perfectly moist.  We also had an egg soda (raw egg yolk, lime (?), condensed milk, and club soda - this was surprisingly very refreshing and tasty.  Neither of us had had this before.  For dessert, we had a \"che\" - Vietnamese desserts - coconut milk, crushed ice, red bean, jello squiggles, and mung bean - it was sweet and my friend absolutely loved this stuff.  Overall, my friend (who is Caucasian in case you were wondering) really liked the food.  I introduced him to several \"weird\" foods including blood cake, and he even thought that was okay.  Perhaps it takes a more complex palate to detect the minor differences between good Vietnamese food and mediocre Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"This review is a cross between 'meh' & 'ok'.  I've been to this place about 3 times. The egg rolls are really delicious. They don't tell you this, but you can actually order as few or as many as you want. If you order less than 6, make sure you ask for the mint leaves, lettuce, cucumber, & dipping sauce. Use the lettuce to wrap the egg roll & add your fixings. DELICIOUS.   I ordered the number 1 for lunch. It is a noodle dish with meatballs, tripe, tendons, & flank steak. I don't know the Vietnamese name for it. They give you bean sprouts and lime to add as condiments. On the first  2 trips the soup was good.  However, on the last trip the tripe & tendons were inedible. I couldn't even chew it and I have teeth like a horse. I won't say i'd never go there again because I will. Perhaps i'll try something else on the menu and avoid the tripe and tendons all together."}
{"text":"Affordable prices , great fast food . We will be back! The menu was really interesting that I want to come back to order something new . The menu has very clear pictures so you kinda have an idea of what the dish is . Also vegetarian friendly ! Great friendly staff!"}
{"text":"There were so many choices on the menu! But not to worry! I was already craving shrimp! I decided to get the shrimp and chicken in rice paper. And I was more than impressed ! The food is fresh! The peanut sauce is spectacular !  The service is sweet! The place is so clean! Definitely a place I would come on the regular!"}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food, and thanks God I found this jewel in the middle of east way, we weren't sure what we were getting ourselves into turn into a wonderful experience we order the traditional pho ga  and some crispy noddles with seafood on top, we loved it, the pho ga have  that homemade taste and it's my favorite from now on, it's a shame we live so far away!  There aren't so many Asian restaurants as neat as this one , very clean , a very pleasant Vietnamese song playing  was very relaxing, thanks to the owners and the staff. We had a great experience!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based off the reviews. Once again Yelp put me in the right spot for dinner! They took our order with no problems and said it would be 5 to 10 minutes... what! That's fast for a order for 3 people. Once we arrive the food was just about ready and the people were sooo nice and friendly."}
{"text":"One star Bc I've been here couple of times  thinking it's gonna change, the proportions aren't enough. Isn't worth the money."}
{"text":"I wanted Pho so bad.  My friend suggested we get on Yelp and find a place near by.  This resturant popped up and we started to look at their menu.  I usually have the chicken Pho wherever I order from.  This place did not offer chicken.  I decided to try something different so I ordered the brisket and my friend ordered the rare steak.  I wasn't too thrilled over the brisket but my friend really enjoyed the rare steak.  I ordered the kids bowl and it was plenty for myself.  My friend being a pig ordered the Large and it was a nice portion size.  We also ordered the fresh rolls with pork and shrimp.  Delicious I must say.  I could eat those daily.  We called to place order and the gentleman was very helpful and even offered us a coupon code for 10 dollars of our order.  Great service."}
{"text":"This place is the best Vietnamese in Charlotte hands down! Not only is the food on point, my favorite is Bun w/egg roll, pork and shrimp, the price you can't beat, $9.95! When you walk in it is clean, has great ambiance and the service is impeccable. This is a true family run business and they are exceptional. I go here not only because of the food, price, ambiance, but it feels like family. It's been awesome to get to know then over the years and I am all about supporting local small businesses!"}
{"text":"We just found out today that they are closing. This is by far our favorite Pho place in Charlotte. Such a sweet family! We wish you the best!"}
{"text":"New Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte. I'm Vietnamese and I eat vietnamese food everyday. I've eaten at every place located around Charlotte but this is by far my new favorite restaurant. I've eaten here everyday for the past two weeks and there has not been an item that displeases me. Great for family sharing meals or a cold rainy day a Pho bowl hits the spot, it's noticeably that everything is fresh!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a \"non-chain\" place for Pho and this quaint place popped up in Google search. One word: amazing. Service and food were delish.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I like this place even more with each visit! The service has become very friendly, the taro and coffee (blended) boba are delicious and they now offer online ordering thru Yelp. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"The waiter could not understand what we where asking him about food. Then, when we asked for a small side of fried rice, he told me it was not possible to order just a side. So we ordered a plate, which he told me was $5.99. Food came out. Looked nothing like the Lemon Grass dish that we have ordered many times from many locations. Food was not great either. Ok, they are 2 for 2. Lastly, they tried to charge me $12 for the fried rice. Done. Not recommended."}
{"text":"On a visit to Charlotte, Hubby and I wanted to check out one of the Vietnamese restaurants because we had heard good things - and Pho Hong didn't disappoint. We arrived for lunch on a rainy Monday afternoon and were seated (with high chair for our 1 year old) at a table booth right away. The pho was great! Tasty, clean broth. The bowl wasn't impressively large, but it was FULL of noodles and my 3 chose proteins (tendon, beef balls, tripe). The hostess/waitress is about 8 months pregnant, though, and it felt kind of wrong to have her waiting on us!"}
{"text":"I am a lover of pho but am by no means an expert. I have a couple of places around Charlotte to get my pho fix but when this place opened so close to my house we were all super excited. I ordered the seafood pho..#41. The shrimp was a nice size but the other meats that were suppose to be in there were represented by some kind of pink seafood shavings. The broth was very tasty. I ordered take out but the decor is nice and the place was far from busy. I'll probably be back cause it's so close to my house but for a really good pho experience I would recommend Pho An hoa or Ben Than."}
{"text":"My first time there last night with a bunch of friends. So many selections! We had the grilled fish wraps and meat griddle wraps. Delicious and fun to eat. Owner was super nice and friendly and gave each of us a free drink. :) They are having an anniversary special where u get a free drink with a meal. Everything was great and the staff was super nice and friendly. I will def be back even though it's a bit far for me but it is def worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this week, food was delicious and my desert cup (Che) was so darn good I got me a second cup! We got the Bo muc Tom nuong and I enjoy that very much, made me feel like I was back in Vietnam again. Only with AC. Taking my parents here for lunch on a few weeks!! My stomach very much enjoyed this place. Will be returning for some more Che"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful food friendly staff an a fair price for the food always walk away with a full tummy an great healthy options"}
{"text":"Best Pho I've ever had! Try the BBQ pork pho! The meat is tender and flavorful. I get takeout from here once a week. They package each thing individually: meat, broth, noodles, toppings like sprouts, basil, and jalapenos. Very reasonable prices! Family owned and operated and they are super nice people!"}
{"text":"Hidden treasure. Friendly service. Great appetizers. Large menu selection. Great price. What moe to say. Coming back again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and was excited to go. This was going to be a culinary adventure for the family! Unfortunately it was a \"hot mess\".  The wait staff was friendly but really not helpful. We ordered the Grilled Pork Rice Paper Rolls, the Bo Tom Nuong Vi (I thought everyone would like grilling their own food) and asked for an appetizer portion of noodles with meat that the waiter suggested for my children. We specifically told the waiter we did not care for squid (Muc) and only wanted beef and shrimp. I was excited to try a \"33\", Vietnamese beer.  As we were sitting in a booth with not much room, the waiter suggested and helped us move to a bigger table. The staff set up the grill, brought out the proteins and a semicircular bowl of hot water. A waitress asked if this was the first time we had ordered this and we said \"yes\". Sitting on top of the beef and shrimp was a large amount of squid. At the bottom of the hot water bowl were some dead gnats/bugs, as pointed out to me by my spouse; I chose not to mention it. No one told us what the bowl was for or gave us any instructions/tips on how to proceed even after they asked and knew this was our first time. We decided to just avoid the water container altogether.   Next came a full size portion of crunchy noodles with shrimp on top, not an appetizer portion. Now a waitress had officially taken over for our waiter. We mentioned that the portion was way bigger than we ordered, asked if kids ate this dish and pointed out there was squid on top of our other food. She apologized and said that she had never seen kids eat those kind of noodles (too difficult to eat) and she would have recommended small bowls of Pho. She said that the cook hadn't listened and made some mistakes (don't you write these things down when we order). We picked the squid off and placed it in a bowl. It would have been really nice and professional if someone had offered to replace the squid with more of the beef or shrimp we had originally ordered; no one did.  The Rice Paper Rolls were just okay. To her credit, the waitress was very apologetic but apologies only go so far. We were not charged for the crunchy noodles (which no one ate) and the bill was still $40+. $26 for a few slices of beef and shrimp ended up feeling way overpriced and not as much fun as I had thought. On the way out she said we should come back and try the Pho. If Pho is one page of an almost eight page menu, maybe your menu is too large...  On the way out, employees were sitting cross legged on the sidewalk smoking...  Unfortunately I cannot recommend this place. Sorry, like I said, I really wanted to like you!"}
{"text":"My friends and I tend to come here at least once a week. Great owners, great service, great food! The bun, spring rolls, and house special fried rice are our go to's and they always hit the spot."}
{"text":"A great lunch spot but would be awesome for a group dinner because not only do they offer hot pot meals but they have a huge appetizer grouping."}
{"text":"There are some things that are good about this restaurant and some things that are not so much. And here it is, there desserts are really delicious. I loved their Che Ba Mau. However, desserts will not be able to sustain you alone. Their Com Ga Roti, is delicious as well, including their pho. The problem that they have is their portion size is very much so on the small size. Their entree size is what you would receive for a lunch size portion in most restaurants. Their shaken beef marinade is extremely salty. I am hoping the owner reads this and truly listens. Because I really want for this restaurant to work. Their location is great for me. Their wait staff is truly kind and wonderful!"}
{"text":"Best place in Charlotte for pho!!! No complaints, service is great, staff is amazing."}
{"text":"I go here twice a week at least. I love their broth so much more than any place I've ever tried in Charlotte. It's always fresh, flavorful, light, and delicious. I've only ever tried the Pho, but all the meats are great (by the Vietnamese standards of weird meat) and the seafood pho is delicious! The service is always phenomenal. You can see the love that this family has for this place. Take out takes 5 minutes. Dine is always quick and hot. Don't let the area and the shopping center it's in scare you away, this place is incredible. For me, best in Charlotte, hands down."}
{"text":"Came here just for the boba.  The location was fine, service as expected, and drinks normal (pre-made stuff).  I wasn't super excited about the size of the coconut jelly--it was cut into squares rather than rectangles so it kept on blocking up the straw.  Given how pretty much every aspect of these drinks are pre-made and standardized across, like, every restaurant that bothers to serve them, I wish I could have just enjoyed sipping it like a regular blended beverage.  Not bad, just not convenient.  Price was fine, since it's not Uptown."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place, especially with all the amazing reviews. Underwhelming. For $10 a bowl, you would expect the pho to be a good size. However, it was tiny. If you compare the sizes to all the other Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte, you will get much more at any other restaurant. The broth was warm, not hot, and we didn't receive our beansprouts until five minutes after the noodles came out. The waiter was nice but the person who actually served our food was rude and wouldn't say anything and instead just plopped our food down and walked away. Nothing special and won't be returning."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I come in here about twice a month. The service is always great. The pho is pretty good. I have to be honesty its not the best pho, but its good bang for your buck. The portion sizes aren't massive like they are most places but I like that. I like that I can finish the bowl without broth pouring out my eyes and ears. They also don't skimp on the proteins like they do most places! We usually get some kind of roll(Always delicious). My only complaint would be that sometimes the pho is greasy. But all in all a solid 4 stars!"}
{"text":"One of Charlotte's best Vietnamese places! The quality and taste of the food is consistently great and the service is excellent. I've also noticed that the menu is clear and concise with accurate descriptions and photos so that's great for newbies or those not familiar with Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Great new place! We got take out tonight and we ordered brisket pho bowls. Husband and I agree, this is some of the better broths we've had!  Will certainly return to dine in soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's my cooler weather go to! It's relaxing to sit and sip on a hot bowl of pho while calming music plays! Grab you a boba tea on the way out and don't forget to say hello and goodbye to the fish!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and learned how to ask for their help. I am not experienced with Vietnamese restaurants, so I am pretty clueless. The staff is very friendly and always helpful! I do know good food and I have found it here!"}
{"text":"Bun bo hue was phenomenal. Employees were very friendly. I got a takeout order but the restaurant looked nice and clean."}
{"text":"This place was very good.  The staff was nice and welcoming.  The food came out extremely quick and was hot and delicious.  The prices were also phenomenal.  I am sick of going to get Pho or Thai and paying $12-15 for a regular size meal or even lunch portion. The regular Pho here is $7.95 and I had to take some to go.  Will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"This is some of the authentic and freshest Vietnamese food that I have found!  The atmosphere is pleasant, service is very friendly with suggestions offered and questions answered with a high level of detail.  Eastway is not an area that I have visited often, but this restaurant will definitely bring me back!  This unexpected find was terrific!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"My first experience trying Pho was the best! The owner was extremely friendly and helpful. I tried a kids bowl of seafood pho and a pork egg roll. Man oh man those egg rolls are homemade and the BEST I've ever had. The pho was interesting very very interesting. I think you have to have an acquired taste to eat it but it wasn't nasty. I think I'll have to explore a little more to find out exactly what I want and like. Very clean and fresh atmosphere. I will surely be back"}
{"text":"Good pho. More authentic than some other places.smaller portions available, good for lunch. They have bubble tea which is a plus."}
{"text":"Yummy! Love it! Great first experience while at the Taste of the World tour in Charlotte! Tried the pho and spring roll and both were delicious and tasted fresh! Can't wait to try this place again!"}
{"text":"To be fair I ordered food from Pho Hong for delivery through door dash, so the experience in store might be better, but the food that was delivered to my home was awful. Ordered the bun with tofu, pork, and egg rolls. What I got was a sloppy packaged wad of rice noodles - no herbs at all - overcooked tofu and pork fat. Literally was absolutely almost inedible. Was very upset that I paid $10.95 for food overcooked rice noodles and tofu I could have made for less than $1.   Save your money and go down the street to  Pho Huong Que on Independence. Way better food prepared in a more traditional style and with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Great place. You must go to see for yourself, great Pho!!! Broth was excellent.  We are from up north and wanted a taste to remind us from home and this was better the home."}
{"text":"Wow- wonderful new restaurant. Will definitely return to try various menu offerings. As others have commented, it's a huge menu but the choices are clearly described- and some have photos. Many varieties of Pho- I had the rare beef and cooked brisket. Beef quality was excellent and the soup broth just delicious. Also had a chargrilled pork which I liked as well. Look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly and the food is so fresh and flavored perfectly! This is my favorite Pho restaurant in Charlotte! Also, I always order the honey dew boba/bubble tea!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me about this place and i gave it a try. They were pretty busy when we came and it seems like they were short staffed. However, we were greeted and sat quickly. Our server was very friendly and gave us her recommendations when we asked her whats their specialty. We got the grilled fish(ca nuong),chicken curry on rice(ga roti), and the little meat thingies wrapped in some kind of leaves (bo la lot). They were one word: DELICIOUS! The service was a bit slow( understandable since it was still grand opening week) nonetheless it was worth coming.   I would definitely return and would recommend to all my family and friends."}
{"text":"I just ate here for the first time today and I'm so happy I did. I've tried quite a few other Vietnamese restaurants in the area and this is by far my favorite! My friend and I order cha gio to start (they was perfect) and we each got a different rice combo. Everything was perfectly delicious and our server was great. I honestly can't wait to come back and try more of their menu.   All in all a great experience. This is my new go-to Vietnamese spot!"}
{"text":"I see a sign with the word Pho and my mind tells me I must eat there. So that is what happened. I was across the street shopping in the plaza with my family and saw the word Pho in the distance and I turned and told my hunny we had to go there. So off we went.  And I will be honest, I walked in and it was deserted, quite empty. I wasn't sure what to expect and was prepared for mediocre food. The staff was very friendly and attentive without being overbearing.  When we ordered pho and I took the first sip, my belly started to dance. It was good and flavorful. I could pass on their shrimp and pork rolls but everything else we have had is delicious here.  What I really enjoy about this place, is that their prices are affordable and a bowl doesn't cost me too much. The only drawback for me is I am seldom in the area but when I am it is a guarantee that I will always stop here for some delicious eats. This is definitely a contender in my top 3 for viet food in the Queen City."}
