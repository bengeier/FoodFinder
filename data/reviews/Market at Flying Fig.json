{"text":"I stopped by here hoping to pick up a sandwich for a Sunday afternoon picnic, only to discover that they had stopped making sandwiches 2 hours before closing time (5 PM when closing is 7 PM - really??). Despite the lack of sandwiches, the shop has a good but small selection of cheeses, crackers and beverages."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. Light enough to go back to work and full of flavor. Huge thanks to Hannah for the cuisine recommendations as well---friendly and knowledgeable staff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Attended a wine tasting, I felt it was misrepresented in the flyer. It was too expensive for the tiny glass pours, the host was snooty and drank more wine than the paying guests. I was so disappointed"}
{"text":"Purchased coffee and was not told that it was a bag of unground beans.  When I returned, I requested the beans be ground.  They refused.  I then asked if I could return the beans since I don't own a grinder.  I was refused again.  This is unacceptable customer service."}
{"text":"Great deals on wine had me at $12 for a Willamette Valley Pinot! It was just a juicy as promised. Had the roast beef with pickles & a yummy homemade mayo- fantastic taste at a great price!"}
{"text":"I almost cried when I finished my roast beef sandwich - I was so sorry it was all gone and I would never get to eat another delicious bite.  At $8.50 for just a sandwich (no sides), it was admittingly a little expensive, which makes me extra-glad that it tasted so darn good.  Eat up!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little place! I enjoyed the local charm, and the people serving me were very nice. The sandwich I got, the maple bacon chicken, was fantastic."}
{"text":"Seriously? How have I not reviewed this place yet?! Oh right, I'm always in a super happy food coma after I've eaten there and am therefore unable to type.  Hands down, this is the best sandwich shop....ever. Terrific combinations, amazing ingredients, appropriate prices. I wish I could give Market at the Fig 10 stars, it's just that good."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that I have never stopped here before especially because I have such a great love for sandwiches!! I had one of the best sandwiches in Cleveland and now I am excited to try all of their sandwiches!   This place is small but incredibly quaint. There is no seating with the idea of just grabbing a sandwich and maybe a bottle of wine to go. They offer a handful of deliciously made sandwiches, they offer a soup of the day and have a few refrigerated items for people who have limited time. They also have an entire wall designated for wine- affordable wine!  I ordered the Maple Bacon Chicken but unfortunately they were out of chicken for the day so I went with my second choice of the Smoked Turkey. Each sandwich is wrapped cutely in brown paper with a rope bow- which being \"such a girl\" made me love this place more. The Caramelized Onion Focaccia was so flavorful and not too much bread for the sandwich because it was layered with turkey, then arugula and then more turkey! The bacon aioli was spot on and really added a level of sophistication to an otherwise signature everyday sandwich.   *Local chefs have posted on instagram about the Egg & Pesto sandwich so I might have to try that one next. Either way I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I came into this cute little shop for lunch on Friday. I have know about this place and Flying Fig for awhile but had yet to stop in. I got half a maple bacon chicken sandwich and couscous salad for $10. You are definitely paying for the quality. The bread was so soft and of course the maple bacon was yuuum and pulled chicken was moist. The couscous was very fresh and flavorful. It's a nice spot to grab and go for a quality sandwich and/or side."}
{"text":"Came here the other day for a quick lunch. Really impressed by the selection cheese, wine, booze, spreads, breads, and dry meats. Took a minute trying to figure out which Artisan sandwich to get because they all looked really good, but took a chance and ordered one. It's close to a $10 sandwich, but the portions are a good and I can agree that it's a really good sandwich. Would definitely come back here. The Market at Flying Fig is definitely another great addition to Ohio City."}
{"text":"Stopped in last Saturday on a whim based on a number of favorable Yelp reviews.  They have an interesting selection of upscale market items, including grass-fed beef for $5.49 a pound, Zingerman's treats, various cheeses and wines."}
{"text":"It's awesome. I got a vegan sandwich to take out and it was loaded with marinated eggplant, olives, greens and other morsels of tastiness. I had a salted dark chocolate chip cookie with it. Like the sandwich, the cookie also came loaded--this time with chocolate chunks. The cookie was not soft, rather it had a nice crunch as I bit into it, which I really liked. It was amply sized as well, which pleased me."}
{"text":"It's that good.  The sandwiches on the menu rock, and the ones on the specials board rock even harder.  I've been coming here at least once a week since this place opened, and I will continue to do so - cause it's that good!"}
{"text":"5 stars for their grilled eggplant sandwich for lunch. Sometimes eggplant sandwiches can be really soggy and dull, but they pull it off WELL. The bread is thick and well seasoned, the vegetables and pesto have an almost meaty roasted flavor, and it was not soggy at all. The sandwich came with a pretty decently large side of chips too.  The sandwich is pricier but definitely worth it because of the portions. My brother and I shared the sandwich and a cobb salad (also huge). We were really satisfied.  We decided to sit down at flying fig rather than taking out at the market. It was definitely worth it because they have a few more menu options. I'll definitely keep Market in mind for a delicious sit down lunch in the future."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch today at this little boutique eatery and market. I went for the vegan sandwich; hummus, eggplant, roasted red pepper, arugula, olives and capers on a house made baguette. The bread is so good that I'd be happy with a toasted slice of this with butter and jam, however, I enjoyed every bite of this genius sandwich.. I imagine every ingredient and product is very carefully selected at this place, and nothing is overlooked. The wines are interesting and compelling, cheeses and cured meats all looked great, and the packaged products were all of the best quality. Wonderful spot to grab a truly imaginative and yummy sandwich or salad on the go."}
{"text":"There are a few things you should know before coming here, so I'll just get those out right away:  1. They're not cheap. You're gonna pay $10 for a sandwich, but it's made with fresh, oftentimes local ingredients, while you wait, and the portion size is more than enough to satisfy most appetites. They also wrap it up in cutesy brown paper tied up with a string. Awww...that's worth an extra buck or two, right? 2. There's nowhere to eat inside the tiny little shop space so you'll have to get your sandwich to go. When the weather's not total shit for those three months out of the Cleveland year, they do offer patio seating.  Now on with the show.  The wife and I were on the prowl for some grub during a recent Saturday afternoon run to Ohio City. Most weekends we stay away, far away, from OHC because of the insane crowds. On this day we were feeling adventurous and hungry. So what is Market at Flying Fig? To pyt it simply, it's a classy sandwich joint owned and operated by the same folks behind the amazingly awesome Flying Fig eatery. They also double as a wine and cheese shop but I wouldn't go out of the way to go there for craft beer - seems like a bit of an afterthought. So what about the food?  This place is all about the sandwiches. On the big board behind the counter there are 8 different options, all spruced up takes on rustic favorites like French Ham, Smoked Turkey and Maple Bacon Chicken. There's even a Muffaletta if you're feeling so inclined. You can get a half sandwich/side combo where you can mix and match with sides like egg salad, soup, potato salad and fresh couscous salad. Sweet tooth nagging you? Cookies are $2 each with yummy options like peanut butter with chocolate chunks and golden raisins or dark chocolate chunk with sea salt.  Me: French Ham - I love ham. We go way back. This sandwich was delicious. The ham was salty, smokey porcine perfection and it couldn't have gone better with the smooth, nutty Gruyere. I loved the combination of the house-made sweet pickles and Dijon mustard, and the arugula was so fresh I wanted to smack it. But that baguette, it just doesn't work. It's way too hard and chewy to work with a sandwich. Every bite was a struggle to stop the innards from squishing out the back end. It was a messy-fingered excursion indeed. I'd suggest a soft multi-grain, seedy bread or buttery brioche instead.  The Wife: Smoked Turkey + Potato Salad Combo - The first thing that hits you about this sandwich is the caramelized onion focaccia bread. It's immensely aromatic and flavorful, the sweet onions, the herbs, and it's so damn soft you'll wanna take a nap on it. Unfortunately, it's so present that it nearly takes over the entire sandwich. Not that the smoked turkey wasn't tender, juicy and bathed in the perfect amount of bacon aioli, it's just fighting for attention. The potato salad, while nothing to write home about, was pretty tasty, if not a bit underseasoned and under-diced. I've got a big mouth, but c'mon people. Kudos for working in some bacon. Could have also used a more acidic punch.  Yup. That about sums it up. Sure, I was nit-picking (except for that baguette) but when a place is so close to nailing it one has little choice. Tasty sandwiches, fresh ingredients, right across the street from a brewery, it's a good thing.  P.S. I've got my eye on you Maple Bacon Chicken sandwich. Don't get comfortable."}
{"text":"The seasonal salad with chicken or steak is always on point. And, let's face it, only the Flying Fig could make a chicken breast taste good even on it's own.   But something that surprised me even more was the vegetarian banh mi I just recently tried. Yes, trust me, it works. They swapped out the pate for lentil pate and threw some caramelized mushrooms on that bad boy. Toss that yummy in with the pickled veg, spicy mayo, greens and that ohmyf*ckinggod baguette and you have yourself a sickeningly good sammie.   Plus, where else can you get such delicious food to go with a bottle of Cava for a picnic...for under $10... on a Sunday?   This place is just perfect."}
{"text":"I don't know if everything is five stars, but everything I have had at this place has been beyond amazing.  A tiny little place dubbed, \"A small urban pantry\" located right next to the Flying Fig, this place is incredible.  There is a small deli case with all your normal homemade take home wares like duck confit or chicken croquettes.  Looks delicious.  A small, but diverse selections of wines and a unique selections of cheeses and meats to create classy platters of deliciousness.  The pork sandwich is one of my favorite sandwiches ever.  The pork is tender and served with tart pickled fennel, fig jam, local cheese on a fresh baked onion focaccia (no clue how to spell it) roll.  The eggplant sandwich was also delicious but I just keep getting the pork.   Oh and definitely get some homemade shortbread.  For 1.25 you get crispy shortbread with a mound of homemade salted caramel on top.  Hard to eat but it doesn't matter.  I just resorted to biting the caramel off the paper.  Then licking it.  So good. It follows the Fig's concept of only serving delicious local products and you can tell everything is so fresh."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches, although a little on the pricey side. Be careful if the bread for a sandwich has run out--sometimes you'll get a much smaller sandwich and be asked to pay the same price."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for lunch as part of one of the yuppiest days in history. We rode our bikes down to Ohio City, enjoyed some beer at Great Lakes, did some shopping, and chose this spot for a carryout lunch. I got a two-cheese and my husband went for a beet and goat cheese sandwich, both of which were incredibly tasty and worthy of association with the Fig. The store is pretty small, but makes up for that in the quality of the offerings. I only dock a star because some of the prices for packaged goods seemed a bit high even for a shop like this."}
{"text":"I was a lucky lucky boy yesterday.  My lovely wife brought me a grilled eggplant sandwich on onion focaccia for lunch an a chocolate chip cookie.  The sandwich was excellent.  The focaccia was really quite perfect, chewy, delicious.  Ingredients were sundried tomato pesto, fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers, pickled fennel, greens and olive salad.  Can I have another one please?  Skip the cookie, it wasn't worth it.  It was stale and totally missed the mark."}
{"text":"This is a terrific upscale take-out deli and mini market focusing on local and gourmet foods.  It's tiny, but they make great sandwiches to go and have some cheese, meat, great wines and other deli selections.    My favorite sandwich is the roasted beet sandwich, which has thinly sliced roasted beets piled on top of amazing bread with goat cheese and a balsamic drizzle.  This is clearly the best sandwich, but their other options are great, too!  I liked the smoked turkey on focaccia and the grilled eggplant as well.    My only complaint is that the hours are really different from the hours of the restaurant, so make sure to call ahead to make sure they're open.    Highly recommended!  Great to grab lunch, food for a picnic, or meat and cheese for hors d'oeuvres."}
{"text":"Market at Flying Fig makes some of the best sandwiches in Cleveland. I eat a lot more bread and sandwiches as the temperature drops and we approach winter. Ohio City is home to two of the finest sandwich shops in the city which are the Market at Flying Fig and Bogtrotter's Doorstep. An interesting combination of meat, veggies, bread and dressing can be yours for only a couple dollars more than a Subway sub. I have tried many different options here and one of my favorites has been the vegan. Not one sandwich has been less than satisfactory. The baguettes from Blackbird Bakery are fantastic as is the multigrain. This is one of my usual stops after shopping at the West Side Market on the weekend. The people who work there are friendly. Last visit we were talking about the Portlandia episode when while dining at a restaurant, they ask the server if the chicken was local, was he happy, what was his name (Colin) and then go to the chicken farm and meet the owner. That is especially funny because the Fig is all about locally sourced stuff. Next time you want a nice sandwich, skip going to Bodega in Tremont and come here. They will wrap you up a fantastic sandwich and tie it up with a nice piece of string to cutify the whole ordeal. They also carry a plethora of wine, cheese and other things too rich for my blood."}
