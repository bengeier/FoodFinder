{"text":"I've tried many burrito joints and this one was so-so first time here and I had a large pulled pork it wasn't that bad tho I did find the pork a little to salty for the price around $9-$10 if you add guac which is $1 extra 

The tortilla wasn't grilled long enough so taking the first bite was kinda soggy it's loaded with rice,beans and other toppings basically how you'd order at subway.
Very filling though though if only they had cooked veggies like green,red peppers & onions that other places do

I also ordered 2 tacos, steak & ground beef soft taco 
I liked the ground beef more as it was moist and flavourful the steak however was REALLY dry & they put the tacos in a take out box which is really messy as the sauces leak out it should be wrapped individually in tin foil

I did come back here a 2nd time but this time just ordered a chicken burrito you can do mix of 2 meats so I had 1/2 chicken & 1/2 ground beef,the chicken was actually really good juicy and not dry but what I couldn't tell was if the chicken was actual chicken breast or processed as it's sliced and almost tasted like those process chicken breasts"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food. This place serves a decent meal and the price seems right. However the raising is so low since i found a hair in my salsa, the staff wasn't paying any attention and I think one of them was vamping under the counter before i got to him. Never will go here again."}
{"text":"They've abandoned the hard taco shells for a taco salad, alas, but the chicken is good and the workers are polite.   If the lettuce they offer is turning brown, ask for fresh. They sometimes forget their food handlers' sanitation training.  Yesterday, heads were uncovered with one server having a lot of hair falling in her face (and into your food).  And though they're pretty good about wearing plastic gloves, they'll take the money with the gloves on and then reach for your utensils, protecting their hands but not you."}
{"text":"Best burrito in town BARnone! The people are super friendly too! A little annoying to pay 1$ extra for guac....should be 50 cents or no charge.  Otherwise these people male a mean STEAK burrito! THE MEAT WAS ACTUALLY TENDER AND SOFT LIKE SIRLOIN STEAK.  I love this place and look forward to stopping by everytime I'm at home depot IN GERARD SQUARE"}
{"text":"Grabbed a burrito here after shopping at Gerrard Square.  The burrito was very filling and delicious, however, it was a bit too moist for my liking (I had sour cream and hot sauce in my burrito).  The servers warn you about how spicy the hot sauce really is-and they're definitely right!  You only need a tad amount of spice so your mouth won't bur"}
{"text":"Food court meal at Gerrard Square.  It's been a while since i had nachos.  And to be honest, i was doubtful of ordering nachos from a food court stall.  But i decided to brave up and took a risk.  The process reminded me of making a subway sandwich  at Subway.  I was asked to select my vegetable toppings,  then the meat.  It was cool that there were choices of meat such as chicken, ground beef, and other varieties.  So i went for ground beef.  I also saw that they had churros on the menu, so i asked for one.  The last time i had churros were in Spain, and they were fabulous in my memories!!  
The nachos were surprisingly decent.  I would definitely go back and get them again.  The churro tasted like bland twizzlers, so that's  a no.  I spent $12 on this meal.  I thought it was on the expensive side for a food court meal, and will really only go back for more when i have crazy cravings for nachos."}
