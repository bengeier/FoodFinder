{"text":"Delicious. My go-to place to grab some dinner before heading to class. Usually works out to be under $12. So tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"I just discovered today that I can get fresh veggie juice here!  I don't know why I bothered to go to booster juice!  Anyhow the new Reno looks great (haven't been here since the Reno).  The service is terrible and I would agree with the other reviews in that sense.  The juice was great.... A bit pricey $5.07 for the medium juice, but also not an unexpected price either.  The service is slow, and the woman I dealt with today was on the phone on a personal call when I arrived.  I asked her what vegetables could be used in the juicer and she seemed annoyed.  She pointed to the wall and said you can read I over there.  There was a paper stuck to the wall with the fruits.  I decided upon a spinach one.... But alas, no spinach available. I liked my juice and I like the selection of fresh options as well. While I was waiting for my juice I looked around and I really felt that the place looked really messy.  I don't know if they just had a really busy day and hadn't time to clean up or if they just don't seem to care.  There were 3 people working at the time but one was on a personal call so I don't know.  My 3 star review most for the service though.  My juice was great!"}
{"text":"ONE OF THE WORSE SPOTS AT YORK!

first: its pricey!
second: their staff are the rudest especially the blonde lady that owns it and her red hair companion!
third: i do feel the owner is a racist lady, I have seen enough situations especially with specific backgrounds and things that happened to my friends that proves it. Plus they get agitated so easily and then start talking crap about u in Hebrew ( blonde and red hair lady) and they did not guess that I'm fully aware of what they are saying!
fourth: unhygienic 

their fruit smoothies are fresh and they are real fruits ( not powder like the Asian shop across)  especially in the case of watermelon/lychee smoothie .Their salads are not bad at all and you gotta weigh it accurately because if you don't choose wisely your bill will be higher than expected!"}
{"text":"I really don't like this place. I've been a York student for four years and I try coming back to Berries & Blooms to give it a shot every so often and I'm always disappointed with their service - everyone is so rude and doesn't have the time of day for you. Further, they're clearly NOT hygienic. On so many occasions I have seen them make sandwiches or handle food without gloves, once I asked for a sandwich and the lady didn't bother to put gloves on. Makes me wonder what they're doing when they make their salads. They don't bother to keep it clean after a long day where there is salad spilling over everywhere either and sometimes their fruit looks dirty. If you come early enough in the day it isn't as bad but they should at least try to keep up with cleanliness after a rush. I heard that they failed their food inspection once and that could easily be a rumour but based on what I have witnessed I would not be surprised. It's too bad because it IS a handy salad bar to have on campus, very quick and convenient and healthy."}
{"text":"In York Lanes (the mall at York University) there is a great little salad and fruit bar that is the envy of all other eateries on campus. It is firstly, the healthiest choice amongst the other restaurants and from what I've seen and experienced, a popular choices amongst the students. (One of my old faves.)

 Located in the middle of York Lanes on campus, Berries & Blooms contains a very large counter of dozens of trays, filled with hordes of fresh fruit and vegetables that is stocked daily. 

 You can also enjoy a number of fruit smoothies, shakes and they also have a wicked breakfast sandwich menu, and the heftiest-for-your-buck lunches around. The sandwiches are so big, half of one is a meal in itself! My favourites include the avocado sandwich and the turkey...

 So, if you are a student on campus, rushing on your way to fall asleep in your humanities class and need a quick bite, try a healthy alternative for a great price!"}
{"text":"The best place on campus if you want to eat healthy, fresh, and delicious. Such a shame it's so small-I wish there was more seating."}
{"text":"Getting fresh veggies and fruits from Berries & Blooms became a twice a week habit during my last two semesters at York U. I used to frequent the old sandwich/salad/frozen yogurt place that used to be beside BMO because they had affordable salads and fruit smoothies, so I was pretty upset when they closed down during the York Lanes renovation. I had to find a new source of healthy food on campus...so I checked out Berries & Blooms.

I had always avoided B&B in the past because the lineup always seemed too long and I didn't like the idea of paying for my food by weight. I can now say that the lineup moves quickly and paying by weight makes a lot of sense, provided you choose your food wisely (e.g., kale weighs next to nothing and is very nutritious, while grapefruits will cost you quite a bit because of the high water content). There's a good selection of healthy foods, including quinoa, couscous, tuna, broccoli, salads and a wide assortment of fruits. Everything has always been very fresh. The only thing that I thought was kind of weird was the few weeks that the \"kale\" was actually kai lan, also known as Chinese kale...it was soon changed back to regular kale, and though I didn't mind the kai lan because I grew up eating it at home, I'm sure it caused confusion for some customers who didn't expect to eat plain Chinese vegetables with their quinoa. 

In my opinion, the fruit smoothie menu is the star of this establishment. They're much cheaper than Booster Juice or Yogen Fruz smoothies, but taste just as great and come in a large cup. Each smoothie consists of three fruits, though some fruits come in the form of juice, while others are actually blended fruit. I usually chose raspberry (fruit), grapefruit (fruit) and guava (juice), which tastes delicious mixed together. You can ask which fruits are actually fresh and which are just juice, because there's no point in getting a smoothie without actual fruits blended in.

The service has never been rude, but the employees are often seen bickering with one another. It's very strange to see a bunch of older ladies speak to each other with so much attitude. Sometimes the cashiers are extremely nice, and other times they seem completely focused on fighting with their coworkers. Oh well, as long as the smoothies turn out well, right? 

There is very limited seating inside, though I usually found a table for myself because almost everyone buys their fruits and vegetables and leaves. If all the tables are taken, there are always more seats in the Student Centre."}
{"text":"Its too expensive here now. Im not coming here anymore. Hope they lower the smoothie price especially. Customer service has also gone down hill."}
{"text":"We ordered food from two different catering companies for a campus event today. Because York is closed because of weather, I've been trying to call both companies all morning. One of them, Indian Flavour, has said that they will either return our money or honour the catering order at a later date. The other company, Berries and Blooms, has forced their workers to be on campus today and they are charging us even though campus operations have been suspended. I guess they don't make their food fresh. I will never order from them again and I suggest that you do not either. Gerald Milgrom, the catering manager, is an extremely difficult person to work with."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot on campus to grab a healthy, wholesome meal.

You can get smoothies with three fruits for $3.99, deli sandwiches with a bunch of veggie and meat options, or choose however much/whatever you want from the vast fruit/salad bar - you get charged by weight.

Minus one star because the staff can't be bothered to look (much less smile) at you, and because the quality of the smoothies has gone way down, while the price has gone up. Boourns!"}
{"text":"It's terrible service. I use to love this place but after he remodel, the prices have gone up and the staff just seems to have lost interests in customer satisfaction. They are rude, and they're always on their phones or talking to each other while customers are waiting to pay or make an order. This is happening even if there are only 2 customers, not busy at all. I will be standing there while they have a conversation and have to wait to pay for my food. Even right now as I'm writing this the whole staff is in the back except for the cashier who is dealing with a long line and he's calling for help in the back. None of them can hear his call because they're all laughing so loud, I can hear it coming from the back. It's just a shame for a place where I could have come to get some healthy food to now be just too frustrated with each experience I have when I come in. Safe yourself the time and hassle and go to elsewhere. If you don't mind dealing with shitty staff then I'd try their sandwiches, crab salad and smoothies."}
{"text":"Terrible!!!  Had hair in my food TWICE in a row.  Brought it back and the workers were so rude. Totally un hygienic,  worker doesn't wear gloves and is grabbing your toast,  going to the back to do who knows what,  then continues to spread butter. So overpriced for such terrible quality.  NEVER go here.  Such a terrible way to start your morning."}
{"text":"My favourite place to get breakfast on campus. The breakfast special is cheap, and always delicious and top notch. I haven't actually gotten any salads and fruits from here, but the one salad that I get with the breakfast is always decent. The only thing is that service can sometimes be pretty bad."}
{"text":"Love this place I always come here for delicious smoothies and gourmet grilled cheese. They have various cheese options. The staff is very friendly and I like the salad bar."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the most expensive salad bars I've ever seen! Went here a few times at the start of term and then decided to save money and pack my own lunch. 

Food's okay. Better if you get a dish when it first comes out. Kind of gross after it's been picked over. Service isn't particularly friendly and the seating is really cramped. 

At least UWO has a fresh fruit market in the student centre. Why can't York?"}
{"text":"What a rip off for fruit. Came here to try it out and that's all they had because they were closing soon. I see a lot of students in campus buy fruit from here so why not? 

UM MAYBE BECAUSE IT'S HELLA EXPENSIVE. 

I got 1 piece of watermelon, 2 pieces of pineapple, 2 strawberries, 2 pieces of mango and 3 pieces of cantelope. The damage: $8.14. My jaw dropped. Seriously, $8 for a handful of fruit - and not even sweet fruit at that."}
