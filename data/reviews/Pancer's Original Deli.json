{"text":"Great deli. Great staff. Great food. Where do they get their bagels from? They're the best!"}
{"text":"One of the few authentic Jewish delis remaining in Toronto. The baby beef sandwich is the best. Corned beef is excellent too. I also like their potato salad and latkas. The rice pudding is the best I've ever had, so creamy and smooth."}
{"text":"Today I went early with my parents and my father loved it! The cabbage roll was delicious and the service on point. I remember the Latka and applesauce the most from childhood. Everything was delicious! Glad we found a neighborhood deli"}
{"text":"4 words. I love this place! I am so happy that it's back. Last year when I went to my favourite bagel place ever, I stopped at Pancer's to have lunch. I was heart broken to see it was closed. I have been coming to Pancer's for 15+ years. My Dad used to take us here for their deli sandwiches and beef kanish with homemade gravy. I have to say everything from their cabbage soup to their sandwiches is amazing. Everything on the menu is made with love and definitely my comfort food spot. 
With their updated interior it lends to a lot more space throughout the restaurant. I was happy to see one of the sons there today. Always friendly. Some new faces but they still make you feel like you're coming home for lunch. 
Here's to many more years of memories and greats eats! 
Cheers Pancer's!!!"}
{"text":"Cosy deli with delicious and hearty food.   Probably the best deli in GTA.  Great service and comfortable booth seats.   We ordered cabbage roll (tastiest that I have ever had) and a tongue sandwich (meat was sliced thin and layered).   Will definitely come back again to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This is very exciting news because my
husband was your customer since
1973 at the Steeles location.
I came on the scene in the 1990's.
We knew Harvey, Leona,  Red, and  Joel.

Pancer's is known as being TOPS
for many years, the best Deli in
Toronto.
I will surely drop in real soon.
Carry on the good work and the amazing
eats forever and ever."}
{"text":"Very good smoked meat and roast beef sandwiches! Good fix if you are craving Swartz's!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant since I was a kid and ordering their famous corned beef sandwich! It's still hands down the best corned beef sandwich I've ever had! The staff here is friendly and quick. :)"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and the food was delicious. 

I had the corned beef sandwich and matzahball soup. The corned beef was juicy, piled high, and tasty. The soup was flavourful, had a good amount of salt, and the ball was nicely textured. The person I was with also had fries, which I took , they are the kind of fries that are crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. They were delicious as well.

Parking is hard to find here at times, I went on the weekend though, weekday would be better I suppose.

Would recommend and would return."}
{"text":"Went with our son & grandson's. We all really enjoyed our meals here and we will be back. If you're looking for a kosher deli, this isn't it! Not only is there bacon on the menu, they're open on the Sabbath. The food was excellent, portions amazing! I was deciding between a cabbage roll appetizer or the platter, glad I only had the appy! HUGE cabbage roll! Helpful & attentive staff!"}
{"text":"The best deli in Toronto, no questions asked. These guys are the real deal. Do a sit in with your family here for an authentic Jewish deli experience. After that, buy their meat from their deli counter to bring the awesomeness to work. Yes, it is slightly higher than taco bell on the price scale, but definitely worth it. I usually get a pound of their lean smoked meat after workouts, nothing like delicious protein :D"}
{"text":"Great pastrami and corned beef sandwiches.  Authentic and family-owned for 4 generations over 60 years. My kind of place."}
{"text":"The customer service was excellent.  It's a clean little restaurant, great if you're looking to grab a quick bite.  The matzo ball soup was really good, tasted homemade.  The sandwiches were good.  The 3 star rating was because I've had better sandwiches."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Deli. Used to go there under the old management and the service was terrible, decor was poor but food was great. 
Ever since they re-opened again under the original owners not only is the decor amazing and fresh but the staff are very friendly and provide great service.
The food is outstanding. My fav is the pastrami sandwich. The roast beef sandwich is great too. Matzo ball soup was enjoyed by someone I went with. 
So many other items on the list I would love to try!
Will most definitely come back and recommend to everyone to go there!
For anyone who tried Schwart'z in Montreal- Pancer's is WAY better!"}
{"text":"They rearranged the tables since new opening and the place has a clean fresh look about it. Service was quick and friendly. When I arrived at 11:30 am it was not too busy but when leaving at 12:30 it was really filling up!
I ordered the pastrami special because I like spicy but maybe I was given plain old corned beef because it definitely was not spicy. The meal was adequate and typically not great."}
{"text":"Best pastrami east of Montreal, period. Glad to see this gem back in family hands. Local beef done right. Awesome place. Way better than the pretenders Kraplansky."}
{"text":"A really outstanding deli.  

I was specifically in the mood for a turkey sandwich and French fries.  I yelped and found minimal options, this was was 45 mins away and out of total desperation we jumped in the car to head over.

It's so unassuming from the front but walking in the aroma mixed with the array of awards let's you know you're in for it!

I asked what came on the turkey sandwich and the server laughed and said \"Nothing but the plate.  You tell us what you want.\"  And sure enough my custom turkey sandwich was out of this world.  The French fries were perfect, abundant and lovely with gobs of ketchup.

Husbandman enjoyed pastrami on rye with fries and was dreaming of another stomach in which to add a second sandwich.  We compromised and got a pound of pastrami and corned beef to take home to Charlotte tomorrow.

Thank you for a spectacular experience!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pastrami on rye with full fat, along with a side of hot mustard (which I asked for after overhearing my table neighbours asking for the condiment).  Am glad I did, because it went great with the sandwich, which was piled high with the pastrami!  Also ordered dill pickles on the side, both fresh and old, and enjoyed the experience of the crunch of \"fresh\" and the brine of the \"old\" pickles.  Was later told by a friend who goes there often that I should've ordered the corned beef...now I have an excuse to go back and try it too."}
{"text":"Ordered the corned beef and two eggs special and the pastrami two eggs special with a side of gravy.

Pros: fast and friendly service, fair prices, nice family feel, yummy food :)

(I virtually licked that gravy bowl clean lol)
Oh and their corned beef and pastrami are made in house! 

Cons: None really. The only reason we're not giving this place a perfect 5/5 is because we're comparing it to our normal deli place - Centre Street Deli (tastes better and more meat but more expensive).


Overall: Great Yelp find. If we are ever in the area again, we would totally go back! So go and check this place out!


Tip: very generous quantity of gravy served in a bowl. I suggest you share it :)"}
{"text":"Food is below average.  Nothing was real good and we ordered basically everything on the menu.  Service was just terrible.  \" I only have seven tables\" but I can't handle them.\" Then maybe management should give you six right?"}
{"text":"Delicious pastrami on rye with a large plate of fries, please. This is your typical deli restaurant with efficient service. Ask the servers about the photos on the walls and they'll be happy to share the long history of Moe and his restaurant. It's an institution for this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Stopped here during a long layover from YYZ and it was worth all the effort! I ordered Montreal smoked meat. It was the best deli sandwich I've ever had in my life! The service was also extremely helpful and friendly. Anyone looking for smoked meat or pastrami - I highly recommend Pancer's."}
{"text":"Got the beef knish platter (with gravy), julienne salad (no salami but they loaded up the turkey!) and potato latkes! 

All of it was fantastic, I called ahead and it was ready right when I got there. 

Really big portions and the price was decent. 

Only bad thing is I live in Scarborough so I can't go there very often."}
{"text":"Loved the corned beef sandwich was amazing  !  Must have!  Great place to have a bite  when in the area"}
{"text":"This is where its at when you are craving a nice smoke meat sandwich. I've been to delis around North America, and Pancer's is definitely on par with most of those places. I got the open roast beef sandwich, which came with fries, slaw,and a pickle. The roast beef had just the right balance of fattiness and leaness. The rye bread complimented the meat well. The slaw was not overbearing and provided a refreshing contrast to the meat. Service was good. Definitely your friendly neighbourhood deli!"}
{"text":"Pancer's is freaking awesome again!! The beef knish's & Latkes are some of the best I've ever had. It's always a super comforting & filling meal."}
{"text":"Always perfectly delicious! I change it up and get smoked meat, corned beef and pastrami sandwiches. If you're REALLY hungry get the fries and coleslaw, the meal comes with a sliced pickle. I typically just get a sandwich and ask for a side of old pickles.
YUM."}
{"text":"Pancer's is just as good as everyone says. I went in there today for my first time and was immediately greeted by the kindest people. I ordered the Montreal Smoked Meat Special, which was delicious and packed with meat. I'd never had one before, so I can't really compare it to anything, but I'm excited to try different sandwiches now that I know how yummy that one was. Their fries are AMAZING. I loved the place and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Ever since I was born, and now that it has reopened under the original family management, Pancer's is hands down the best deli in Toronto and one of my favourite places anywhere.

There is nothing better than a hot corned beef sandwiches on fresh rye with a dill pickle. 

I have always wished that they would open up a second location or food truck closer to downtown, but I still love heading up Bathurst to grab a bite when I can.

My whole family was so upset to hear that the restaurant had closed and are thrilled that it has reopened. 

We stopped by during the opening weekend and were so glad to see a lineup out the door and every seat in the place filled. I hope the place stays full and that Toronto deli lovers do not take this place for granted."}
{"text":"Better than ever. Not sure where I've been.
Probably because they disappeared, reappeared up North then the original Pancer's came back to life north of Wilson on Bathurst, I've been a little confused the past few years.
NO MORE!
This is hands down the best deli meat in Ontario.
No need to search further, my hot lean pastrami fix has resurrected!!
I got goose bumps when I tasted the meat, it was better than I ever remember."}
{"text":"Brisk service with solid basic food.  Had the borstch, matzo ball soup and turkey and roasted beef deli sandwhich.  The cabbage roll was great too.  Good quick service and very solid basic food."}
{"text":"Excellent flavour to the smoked meat sandwich.  Fries were cooked the way I like them, crispy. 
The maltzo ball soup was pleasantly tasty.  Seasoned right and served hot.  
The only downside to going here is the limited parking.  It's in a small strip mall.  
I would go here again."}
{"text":"My biggest regret after stopping in here for lunch was that I didn't get a second sammy to go!  Oy Vey, this is some good pastrami and I left without a spare!  I guess if you don't have the chops, then survival in a predominantly Jewish neighbourhood is not likely.  This is not a serious full-service restaurant, rather it is a quaint deli, with a limited menu of very tasty items.

The pastrami and corned beef are, of course, amazing-juicy, tender, well flavoured, and not a salt infused \"sodium bomb\".  And the little plastic side cups of cole slaw and potato salad reminds me of other well established places.  And the big pickle spear is a classic as well.

Come in, sit down, knosh a bit or get some take out.  Make sure you get a bit of hot mustard on the side."}
{"text":"I know people have said Pancer's has improved since the family bought the restaurant back, but the pastrami at Pancer's was pretty flavourless. The soup broth was good, but the matzo balls should be denser."}
{"text":"I have been visiting Pancer's with family and friends for the past 20 years. They have consistently delivered one of Toronto's best pastrami and corned beef sandwiches. The meat is shaved and piled high in between two thin slices of moist rye bread covered in tangy mustard.

Unfortunately, there have been a couple management changes at Pancer's that have caused some inconsistencies. Apparently, the original owners are back which could restore this Toronto landmark back to 5-star status."}
{"text":"2nd best smoked meat sandwich in Toronto, and of course in my opinion in the city. 

Great friendly staff, lots of room to kick back and enjoy some smoked meat. 

Delicious smoked meat, great tasting heaven. 

What's your favourite. My #1 is secret ;)"}
{"text":"Legit 4-star deli. Everything is good. The knishes are world class. I love the kishka. Friendly service for a traditional style deli."}
{"text":"There's nothing to complain about this place!Extremely fast take out service! After paying $14 at the counter for a corned beef sandwich on rye, I received a enormous chunk of beef, filled with flavours and juices that just made me smile with every bite I took."}
{"text":"Came here with my work group for lunch the other day. There was about a dozen of us but they were able to accommodate us since we had called in advance. It has a nice classic diner feel with friendly staff. Service was a bit on the slow side considering everyone ordered sandwiches but not very slow. While I don't eat beef myself this place is well known for its corned  beef which comes very stacked full of meat. I ordered smoked turkey with sweet potatoe fries and I wasn't disappointed. The sandwich was filling. What I liked about this diner is that they are generous with their portion sizes."}
{"text":"Pancer's has been around a long time, its a REAL Jewish Deli!! The family has been in this business at least 50 years!! This is one of the BEST Jewish style Deli's left in the GTA. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fantastically filling meal, you won't be disappointed! And with ANY Deli sandwich, order Vernors...:-)"}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of the pastrami!
Love that it's made in house and holy crap on the potato salad. 
Line up out the door but it's so worth the wait. 
Looking forward to trying the breakfast menu!"}
{"text":"The only decent GTA Jewish deli outside Thornhill (Center Street Deli). A meal that any Montreal Jew would approve of. And they no longer serve Silverstein's mediocre rye bread ever since that awful place mercifully went under last year. The result is much tastier sandwiches and a great deli meal!"}
{"text":"This was a great alternative to my usual go-to Jewish deli. The food was served in massive portions and was really good; I wasn't thrilled with the untoasted bread on my Reuben since the rye fell apart, but otherwise it was great. The waitress we had was easily in her sixties and I got the impression that she is a member of the family and has been working there for a while. That's great, but at one point she took a strip off another waitress and the two continued to argue in front of customers, even as we waited to place our order. I'm literally sitting there hungry while two women old enough to be my mother are snipping and shouting and pointing fingers."}
{"text":"I'm so happy the original Pancer family is running the restaurant again. The deli meats are delicious. I am not a fan of coleslaw but their's is really tasty and not to much vinegar. The potato salad is creamy, not dry. This is our favourite place to pick up a deli dinner or eat in. We received a dinner platter last night. If you have to send in a dinner or cater I strongly suggest this as your \"go to\" deli choice. The presentation and selection was beautiful. It came with a 5 selections & generous amounts of cold cuts, the slaw, potato salad, sweet peppers, kosher style dills, mustard, plates, napkins and cutlery. The people who sent the dinner in said the service was so friendly."}
{"text":"Everything they serve is a sold 4 star. However their most unique knishes puts them over the top. I give the knishes 6 stars out of 5 as they are in a class of their own. Overall this pushes them to 5 stars."}
