{"text":"This place is awesome. You need to try it. Fresh salmon is the best. Good seasoning great value. Friendly team."}
{"text":"If you're hungry, don't drive by this place without stopping! Prices are right and the po boys are DELICIOUS. I order mine Flounder, regular, and with the po boy sauce and it has just the right amount of zing to it. And good luck trying to get through the whole sandwich - it's huge!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the experience of picking the fish and preparing it for me. I had the shrimp po boy it was seasoned well with fresh lettuce and tomatoes,then I tasted the red snapper that my cousin ordered it was awesome flaky and melted in my mouth.The atmosphere is great.."}
{"text":"Having eaten many a po-boy in Louisiana, I must say the one I ate here today is as good as any that I have ever eaten. The remoulade sauce and fresh bread roll...wowed me. The Catfish was fresh and cooked to perfection.  Highly recommend this."}
{"text":"I am trying to get a hold of someone to place a very large order for Saturday. No one is answering the phone. Please have someone call me 412-443-1777. My name is Abigail"}
{"text":"This place has excellent poboys at a great price. I had the shrimp poboy. It was perfectly spicy with a tasty sauce. The staff was really nice as well. The restaurant is casual but clean and cute."}
{"text":"Saw this on Yelp while still on plane and came for early dinner on our first day in NC. Deserves  five stars and more for fresh and perfectly fried catfish, best ever hush puppies, great okra, and a low country boil so well prepared that even the potatoes tasted special. In addition to the good food the employees were helpful in explaining the menu to us.  We shall be back!"}
{"text":"First time here was on this past Friday wanted to try something new so i stopped in about 20 mins before closing time and it was packed so I knew they must be doing something right!  They have a pretty good size display to show the fresh fish they have, like others have said you can have fish whole to take home or they will fry it there for you. I think they have like 4 different options for the seasoning. The Po boy is the star for this place with the Po boy sauce you cant lose. Dont sleep on just having them fry something else up also because it is Good! I was mad i didnt order more the first time. Yes its on the West side but dont let thay stop you from missing out on this place! I just wish i was closer to it because i will be making multiple trips back!"}
{"text":"My husband loves poboys. That's why this place is getting 3 stars. He did not love his poboy. We both got the salt and pepper whiting poboy. He said it was okay.  I liked mine. The cole slaw was good. The hushpuppies were delicious! I liked my poboy. It was the first one I've ever had. Their tomatoes are good. It made the sandwich so good. They were sweet."}
{"text":"Delicious down south seafood. I went in with my family last weekend, it was our first time. The restaurant is also a seafood market. You can pick from the cooler what type of seafood you would like and they cook it for you (fried or grilled). There are also choices of seasonings. They even have alligator tail! My family had a little of it all and we shared, the scallops were delicious as well as the flounder."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great lunch. There were plenty of people there when I walked in and now I understand why.  Everything was delicious, had the Po Boy flounder, the bread was crispy, the sauce was delicious, and the fish was fried to perfection even...the french fries were awesome!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch with a colleague.  Great place.  The food was fast and fresh.  When you walk in, you are greeted by a large fish counter.  You can order your fish and take it home or have them cook it for you.  There is also a small menu you can order from and plenty of large picnic tables to sit.  I chose the fried shrimp Po Boy and my colleague had the Lowcountry Boil.  We both chose dirty rice as our side.  Mine was delicious.  The Po Boy sauce was awesome and the dirty rice was nice.  Not oily at all.  My colleagues boil was great too - 10 boiled shrimp with potatoes and corn.  Will definitely be coming back here!  Great find!"}
{"text":"Really good food. I had a shrimp Po boy, gumbo,and hush puppies. All cooked fresh and tasted great. Friendly people working there too."}
{"text":"Number one spot for seafood and number one spot for me at the moment period I love the Cajun style shrimp I hear the poboys are good too would highly recommend this place if you're into Cajun seafood or seafood period for that I've been here least 15 times already lol"}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp and hush puppies.  My wife and I had a full meal for around $13.  Great price as we just ordered a around $5 worth of shrimp each.  I got cajun and she got salt and pepper.  Both of us left very happy.   I would stop in here in a heart beat for the price.  They make it fresh so be ready to wait.  I took the kids down the street for some fast food while my wife waited.  It worked out perfectly."}
{"text":"Way more than just delicious Poboy's.  There is a full display of fresh seafood that you can purchase to take home or have them cook it for you.  Service was excellent and the menu looks great.  Worth multiple visits."}
{"text":"Brunch with friends... Amazing! The \"you buy we cook\" style restaurant has some of the best seafood.  I had the fried tilapia and shrimp with coleslaw. Seasoned to perfection.  We even ordered pork skins...these were awesome best ever!!! The prices were reasonable.    Not a lot of seating it will be nice to eat outside in summer."}
{"text":"The food is on point. I got a shrimp po boy the last time I went. The shrimp was seasoned perfectly, and they weren't stingy with it at all. It just takes a long time to get your food. Honestly though, that's not going to stop me from going back because I have my eye on that oyster po boy now."}
{"text":"Pretty darn amazing honestly.  Hate that it took me so long to check it out.  If I'm ever in the area I'll be grabbing a shrimp po boy with fried okra.  Although, I am curious to see how all they prepare such beautiful seafood.  Get the shrimp poboy, have it breaded however you like.  Get some fries or fried okra and grab a tea while you're at it.  Thank me later.  That's it.  That's more than enough food for the first time trying this place.  The poboy is huge!  The shrimp are perfectly cooked, the bread was about exactly what I was looking for.  Spot on, one of Charlotte's best restaurants IMO."}
{"text":"Highly recommended! The staff here is amazing! The food is great and will not kill your pockets. They really take care of their customers. They are a seafood market that also makes food. I had the catfish with hushpuppies and green beans. Totally worth 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place after reading all the amazing reviews. Freedom Drive is kind of lacking when it comes to really good restaurants. Anyway, this place is right next to the Community Thrift Store and there appeared to be plenty of parking. I snagged a spot right at the front during lunch time so that was a plus. Inside there's a counter where you can order various kinds of seafood either raw or cooked (priced by weight), and they also have a menu of sandwiches, salads, soups and sides. To the right is a dining area with a nautical theme. The guy (medium height, sandy blond-ish with a beard) who helped me was really patient in explaining all the options, which I appreciated. He was the bright spot in this whole thing. I ordered a shrimp po boy with Poboy sauce, which he said he would put on the side, and BBQ pork cracklins. When the young woman (short, with short hair) brought out my food, she asked if I wanted sauce. I was confused because I wasn't sure what else needed sauce that I'd ordered. She said since I ordered a poboy, it already came with sauce. Cool. I don't need extra. I'll say that she didn't really have an attitude, but she wasn't as pleasant as the guy who took my ordered. She just seemed bothered that I wasn't sure whether or not I wanted (or needed) extra sauce.   ...of course I get home and there's NO sauce on the sandwich (like the guy and I agreed) but there's also NO sauce on the side. Just dry. It's annoying because someone else mentioned getting home and having a dry sandwich- I should've checked the bag before I left. Oh well.   The sandwich itself was fine, the shrimp was crispy and seasoned well. Sure would've been nice to have some kind of sauce on it. The cracklins were salty and I just didn't feel great about eating them. I'll give them one more shot before making a final decision, but for now it's three stars."}
{"text":"I now have been here twice. Excellent both times!!! Great customer service and the fresh seafood that can be cooked to order, sets them apart. They have one loyal customer with me."}
{"text":"The MAJOR take away from my experience here is the warmth of the staff. It was honestly like walking into your Aunt's house for lunch! My fiancé and I ordered a few different pieces of fish and some shrimp (cuz OPTIONS...lol) and split them. While she LOVED it...being a guy with Charleston roots, I felt there was a LITTLE missing on the complexity of flavor front. It was decent but I've had other spots in town really amp up the flavor when it comes to their options. The different seasoning options (which we made sure to diversify) ended up being not so different from one another which was a little disheartening. Ultimately, though, everything was decent,  just not earth shattering. That customer SERVICE, though, bar none! (And let me reiterate, my fiancé LOVED it...so it could just be a personal taste thing for me...they're definitely worth the trip)"}
{"text":"I give an three stars because I ordered an salad an the lettuce was on top of the chicken and everything else. The eggs should be slice other than that, the service was good."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! Worth the trip to the west side. This place won't disappoint you. The food is fresh, hot & made to order. Their po boy sauce is on point. Loved everything"}
{"text":"Awesome place on freedom Dr. I went here for the first time today and they had a nice crowd coming thru. This is gonna be a popular place in the city. I ordered the flounder Po Boy. I got mines with Po boy sauce which is a must have but they didn't put enough on the sandwich so I'm glad they had bottles that you can take to your table but if you order to go you might want to get some extra if you don't want a dry sandwich. I had the sandwich small fries and bottled water for under $11."}
{"text":"Came to Charlotte for business and tried this place out...absolutely awesome!! It's an adorable little seafood market with nice tables to eat in. Very clean, and the staff is very friendly. Has a menu with simple selections, but you can also order any of the seafood either raw or cooked by the pound. Prices are really cheap for the quality! I'm beyond happy. Tried the oyster po boy, fried Cajun croaker, boiled Cajun shrimp, and dirty rice. Had basically 2 more meals to take home after eating. A must try if you're in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Came back again and more of the same.... awesome fried fish! But a game changer occurred, ordered the Cajun shrimp by the pound and they loaded that box up! Great taste and servings!"}
{"text":"Poboy's is Charlotte's best kept secret. The service is friendly and fast and the food is always piping hot! Moreover, the prices are beyond reasonable. I placed what I thought was a fairly large to-go order today, and when I arrived for pick up I had to ask the cashier if the total was correct as it was such a good deal. I have not yet ordered any fresh seafood from the market to take home and prepare but plan on doing so soon. The restaurant is clean and tidy and doesn't have an overwhelming fishy smell at all. I've only known about Poboy's for one week and have already visited four times if that's any indication of how good it is. As a recommendation you cannot go wrong with any of the fish fried Cajun style, a side of fried okra, and hushpuppies."}
{"text":"I visited Poboy's yesterday for the first time and was extremely impressed!  Kudos to Brandon, Matt and Shamari for awesome customer service from the ordering process to receiving my food.  I ordered the Porgi, Argentina shrimp, rice and beans and fried okra (regular and Cajun fried).  It was soooo delicious!!!  I love the concept of placing an order for fresh seafood and having it cooked while you wait.  Had this same experience in Denver, CO and was so glad to see something like this come to our area.  The seafood is displayed and labeled appropriately, prices are fair, clean and no fishy smell---which confirms the freshness of the supply.  Great job to all.  Thanks for a wonderful experience; I will definitely be back.  Keep up the good work!  Ray"}
{"text":"This is a new favorite of mine, featuring quality seafood & po boys at decent prices. I had an oyster po boy from here (market price, ~$11) and it was amazing. The oyster itself was fresh, but surrounded with a perfectly crisped, cajun-seasoned crust. These babies are clearly handled with love and thrown onto a well-made hoagie roll.  But if you're not into oysters, there are plenty of other options, such as the classic shrimp po boy. In addition to sandwiches, you can buy fresh seafood here by the pound (raw or cooked to order). Lastly, the people working here are so friendly! It encourages me to come back again soon."}
{"text":"As a pescaterian I'm very particular when it comes to seafood. With that said this is one of the beat seafood restaurants I've been to here in Charlotte. The did is fresh and delicious. The Po-Boys are to die for abd that's no exaggeration.   Excellent food! Go check it out."}
{"text":"This place was referred by my husbands coworker. First, just let me say I had my doubts when he said it was on freedom drive. LOL! Once we arrived plenty of parking, restaurant very busy, everyone smiling and happy. We were immediately ask if our order could be taken. After a few minutes of looking over the menu and by the way everything sounded good. They have all types of seafood you could possibly want (of course it's all fried). They also have fresh raw seafood that you can buy by the pound or by the case, we decided on the Po boy shrimp sandwich & the Po boy flounder sandwich. Can I say the shrimp Po boy was amazing! The shrimp was fried to a perfect crisp, it was just spicy enough, not too spicy just the way I like it! The sauce that comes on the sandwich was that extra that made you stop and appreciate all of the wonderfulness in your mouth. I was a little disappointed there were no broiled or steamed options on the menu. Did I mention orders are made fresh. No food setting under heat lamps!! if you're looking for the best fried seafood in Charlotte, definitely hands down Po Boys on Freedom Dr.  is your place. Check them out!"}
{"text":"I have finally found my seafood heaven! The options here are ridiculous at first I was overwhelmed with what to choose. I heard so much about this place but being that it's a bit of a drive I never was in a hurry to go a friend invited me and I am so happy I went. I ordered 1/2 pound of catfish 1/2 fried shrimp fried okra with Mac and cheese. You can tell they are very popular and the amount of food given was so much. I knew as soon as my plate came I would need a to go box. My friend let me try his flounder and I will say that was my fav so far cooked to perfection. The only thing that disappointed me is the Mac and cheese. I am a huge fan of the dish and the one I tried here will not be ordered again. However, I will say that it didn't turn me away from the restaurant still my favorite seafood place in Charlotte so far and I will faithfully take that drive."}
{"text":"Such good food! We had the low country boil fried oysters and red beans and rice.  The young lady that helped us was amazing. She gave awesome suggestions. I'd just landed in Charlotte, this was my first stop. I definitely will be back. Fresh delicious and fast."}
{"text":"Brandon made my first visit here a pleasant one. I had no idea what to order and he made a few suggestions.   Waiting on my food now. I'll come back with an update once I eat."}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place. It was just as the review said it was. Crispy shrimp poboy with soft bread. The sauce was slightly spicy but it worked with the shrimp.  I got a side of gator tail bites which was exactly what I remembered the tail to be. Slightly chewy and stringy but delicious.  In the end the only bad thing that there were not as many customers as I expected."}
{"text":"As a life long NOLA fan, I always wish there were decent places to find good cajun and poboys outside of Louisiana and South Mississippi.  Poboys Low Country Seafood Market is just that place.  It honestly would be about a 3 star in NOLA or 4 star in Mississippi, but I will happily give them 5 stars for Charlotte.  A decent portion of protein flavored well, taste sauces, fresh veggies and most importantly great bread.  If you want a good sandwich be sure to check them out."}
{"text":"I give this place three stars it because of the cleaning is of the restaurant I ordered lunch in one day it was very crowded so I assumed I was getting the best fishing Town considering I read all the reviews however my fish had no taste and neither did my size I had to put hot sauce mustard tartar sauce on everything to even get any type of taste probably won't return"}
{"text":"My dad picked a visit to Poboy's for his birthday dinner and it did not disappoint. This low key fish market is the perfect stop for a sandwich to eat their or pick up some raw fish for home. Everything is out in cases for you to peruse when you walk in. Staff is friendly and helpful with recommendations and suggestions. You get a lot of fish in the sandwiches, more with fish than the shrimp poboy. Deliciously fried, fresh and tasty. The coleslaw was a great side and paired perfectly with our sandwiches. Make sure to ask for hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Super cute & clean spot to dine in and/or buy raw fish to-go! Love the chalkboard menu. I had the Catfish PoBoy fried Cajun style w/ PoBoy sauce & fried okra as a side!! AMAZING!! So fresh... so good! I also ordered a Black Bass @ less than $9/lb they cut into filets for me while my lunch cooked!! I will DEFINITELY be back!! Loved it too much NOT to at least make it a weekly experience! So much different type of fish to try!!"}
{"text":"Great food and Great Service. Brandon was very personable, helpful, and seemed to genuinely care about people. Shemari was very sweet full of smiles and was really great at explaining how things work for out of towners like me. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"The food had really good flavor, the lemonade was great and the service was super friendly and quick. Great seafood for an affordable price, I definitely would recommend. I had the oyster Poboy with a side of hush puppies and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place has the best shrimp Po Boys I've ever had and I'm kind of an expert on them.  Having had some very good ones in Louisiana and Mississippi I would have to say that if these were not the best Po Boys they are equal to the ones I have had I the Deep South.  I strongly recommend you try this place.  It's not expensive unless you are like me and have to try everything.  Lol!"}
{"text":"Not my usual Stomping grounds .... but I was hungry and looked at Yelp and it was well rated and sounded good. Well --- it is excellent ! Great service / clean as a pin / nice folks .... I had the \"spicy\" Shrimp Po Boy ---- super fresh ingredients and id say equal to the best I've had from N.O.  Give it a try - you won't be  disappointed!"}
{"text":"Yelpers....thank you! I was jonesing for a good fish Sandwich or Shrimp Po Boy and after seeing the amazing reviews I had drive over.   Pros: cajun shrimp po boy! It's a large sandwich, the sauce took it to the po' boy level. Location is clean, doesn't have that stuffy Fried foods smell & smog and they offer a large selection of fresh fish.   Cons: I just killed my po boy sandwich and enjoyed my visit - not a con in sight!"}
{"text":"Awesome food good service and great priced. I love alligator Tail. Theirs is fantastic. I'll be returning very soon."}
{"text":"My goodness!!! 5 stars all the way!! First off I love the atmosphere!! My servers were great! So this is a seafood market/restaurant....you come in and get your seafood by the pound raw or cooked!! They have an array of fish from bass, flounder, perch, to croaker (which is my favorite) to shrimp and you can get it Cajun, salt and pepper or any other flavor....it was so so so good to me!!!! I recommend this joint if you are in the area!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment twice and I'm definitely going back! I have not been able to find porgies...anywhere, but I found them HERE!  And they fried them to perfection!   There customer service was amazing both times I visited and they really make you feel at home & comfortable. I feel like their prices are a bit high, but overall it's well worth it.   Stop by for a visit, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great customer service AMAZING FOOD make sure you get the PoBoy sauce it's heavenly on everything that's fried!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Friendly and very helpful staff. I would strongly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Our first time here and they were very helpful as it's not a menu on the wall, we had 20 shrimps, half Cajun/salt and pepper. Heavy on the pepper as I like it ! Mac and cheese, fries and okra as a side. All was delish and under $20!"}
{"text":"Finally we have a place to eat when we visit Charlotte.  The staff is hands down the friendliest I've encountered and very helpful with suggestions.  The very sweet lady who took our order remembered us from our visit two months prior.  The food...OMG... I've ate a lot of fry house style seafood living in the South but their twist on it is so delicious.  The Po sauce on their poboys is da bomb! And their fried fish and shrimp is some of the best I've ever eaten.  Their okra is frozen but you'll mistake it for fresh.  Get the fruit punch then switch to Lemonade so you don't have to choose. Don't forget dessert."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!  Hiding on the west side, down freedom drive, is a great seafood restaurant.  It's also a seafood market, with a good selection.  Don't be fooled by the seemingly limited menu, they can and will cook anything you want.  If they have it in the market, they will cook it for you any way you like.  My wife got 1/4 pound small shrimp fried Cajun style, and really enjoyed it.  The breading was the perfect consistency, not to thick.  I got the low country boil small plate and everything was delicious.  It comes with 10 shrimp, potatoes, corn and sausage.  The seasoning was strong without taking over the dish.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  We just moved to the West side and will be making this a regular stop."}
{"text":"This was such a friendly spot. The \"country girl\" came out in me. I had the catfish stew and had fish fried for my momma.   Everything was delish. When I'm back in town I will be back. The staff was so very friendly and patient. Try the catfish stew when you come. You can purchase to cook or have them do it for you. They do a wonderful job and you house does not smell like fish.  Two parting words:  Go.  Eat!!!!"}
{"text":"It was good but everything was sold separately.??? No Lunch or Dinner plates , Meals or Combos !!! And you leave with a bag full of boxes with separate items in them.Too much . .. Who does that ???"}
{"text":"Choose a fish. Any of the many different fresh fish there. Choose a style. I chose Cajun. Po boy or with sides. Good food under 10 bux including side and drink! Long benches to sit. Oh and if there are others on the table, feel free to ask if you may join.   Shrimp poboy, fried okra, dirty rice and ice tea today"}
{"text":"Best food and best service I experienced in a while. Brandon was so patient and helped us a lot. That's very rare now to see customers service like theirs!!! We enjoyed the food we ordered poboys shrimps, poboys alligator, and pork skins, and shrimp boil was excellent and so dilicious! The owner even take time to greet us when he learned that we are also from new jersey"}
{"text":"Oh My Gosh!! This place!! I visited Po boys today in celebration of my birthday. After hearing rave reviews from a friend and looking up Yelp reviews. Goodbye Captain d's. From the fresh fish display to the genuinely nice, helpful staff, I could not have asked for a more perfect bday lunch. Flounder was outstanding. I ordered a oyster PO boy to go for dinner. Sauces and sides really good! The fried pork rinds came to our table still crackling on the plate. What? I will visit this establishment weekly for my seafood fix. Give this restaurant ur business!! They're earning it!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Charlotte! The menu is incredible (not available online to my knowledge), the food is fresh, the service is top notch, and you get free refills on sweet and/or lemonade.   For $13, I got the shrimp Poboy (cajun style), fried okra (small is plenty to share for two), the mac & cheese, and a lemonade.  They are so well priced and the food was delicious and fresh. I will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"I'm so glad to find this place (Thanks Yelp!). The bread is so fresh and so is the seafood. I also like the taste of their PoBoy Sauce, it has a little kick. I have had the shrimp here and it was so good. Do yourself a favorite and check this place out."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Poboys is the equivalent of great food great service and extremely consistent. Every time I go in there I meet great people the staff is always amazing and the food is good you just can't beat it period I would recommend this place 10 times over over and over and over and over again. It's clean I love how the decor matches the actual establishment and service that they're providing to the public there's always plenty of parking and even though it can be wait times ahead there never longer than 30 minutes. Go here you will not be sorry and I love their cherry cheesecake parfait!"}
{"text":"Love this place and the fresh available food. Always packed so be prepared. The soft crab Po boy was amazing."}
{"text":"I was in the area and stopped by for lunch a few weeks ago and the line was long but moved quickly nonetheless. The young lady who took my order was pleasant and patient. I had the flounder Po'Boy, mac and cheese, and green beans. I planned to save half of the Po'Boy but that did not go as planned once I bit into it! The sides were just ok, but I would definitely return for a Po'Boy."}
{"text":"Excellent spot to stop in Charlotte. Food is outstanding and the staff is very friendly. I had the fried shrimp Po Boy with Poboy's sauce - just delicious. Also got two small sides of okra and hush puppies that were huge, had some left over to take home. Can't recommend this place enough"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place! It's a restaurant and fish market all in one. It's doesn't have the fishy smell which is a plus. I order the shrimp Po boy. You have your choice of 3 different seasonings. Salt and pepper, Cajun, and regular. I tried the salt and pepper and the Cajun, both are great but I like the Cajun the best. The fact that I pick my seafood then the cook it is a plus. Food was very well seasoned. If you are looking for great fried fish/season come here. They have a regular customer out of me!"}
{"text":"I love how the seafood is displayed, beautiful, just beautiful, then i noticed they sell fresh fish by the case, those who know me, im a foodie, Yelp, Foodspotter, CONNOISSEUR.  Please check dem Po Boy's. PS: GREAT EATS."}
{"text":"Totally informal, great service and Good food. No fishy smell, clean environment, and didn't leave smelling like a fryer!    The only thing disappointing was the cracklings.  Shrimp  was super good.  And french fries were nice and crispy, the way they should be."}
{"text":"We can't get enough of this place Let me tell ya'll. The shrimp po boys are EVERYTHING! And that Po Sauce! LAWD HAMMERCY!  We haven't eaten inside yet but will probably do it soon. We've just placed our orders inside and taken it home or the few times we can get someone on the phone (no shade cause I know ya'll are busy) and taken it home but I will say the inside looks very nice and inviting.   So happy to see PoBoys on Freedom Drive. I live in the area and have tired of the other restaurants around. Can't see myself getting tired of good fresh fish tho. My only negative and to me it isn't a biggie (Ya'll can have all my five stars) is that I had a hard time finding if they were open on Sunday or not. Luckily I can just swing by on my way home and look at their sign.   Growing up my father would go to the outer banks and fish and bring it back to fry. This place reminds me of that. Nothing like good FRESH fish. And they season it to perfection. Please go here if you're a fish lover. Even if you don't live or venture to the west side much, make a special trip. It's worth it."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd visit and I have no complaints! The staff is really friendly and helpful. I ordered the Cajun shrimp po boy, side of okra and Mac and cheese, and a sweet tea. I wasn't sure of which side to get so they let me sample them and I chose both. You definitely get your money's worth here in taste and the amount of food they give you. I was only able to eat half of my order.  I will be back for my seafood cravings!"}
{"text":"After all the hype I decided to try them out today. I must say I'm very impressed. Everything was perfect. I got the Flounder PoBoy and Chicken PoBoy along with a side salad. The Salad was even good, they make their own dressings so that's a bonus with me....I'm a happy customer."}
{"text":"At first glance, it might not seem like you have arrived at the right place - I mean it looks like somewhere you can grab dinner (and the kind you eat then and there, or at least take out not the sort you have to make yourself). In fact, it looks like an old fast food joint. Surely they have something to eat. But it says market. And when you walk in, they have a bunch of what appears to be fresh fish, and nothing on the menu that would seem like you can order it to eat.  So... What gives? Just wander up like you have no clue and they'll be happy to help. This is the approach I took and it works wonders.  The staff here is amazing - some of the friendliest and most helpful ever, and patient like you would not imagine (incidentally, they do have menus where you can order po boy sandwiches, they are just usually sitting on the cases containing the fish). Those staff will help you through the menu, or they will help you with something to go.  Then the will give you your number, and bring the food out to you when ready, and be ready - it is a heck of serving. Sandwiches are not small. Sides are perhaps a bit on the small side, but you didn't come here for the sides, you came for the po boys - that's what is on the sign, after all. The one you should definitely try is the cracklins - much better than the kind you'll get in a bag at the store, and with some cajun spice on them, well worth it and they go great with the sandwich."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good shrimp po' boy and I found it. Every meal is made to order. Awesome."}
{"text":"I'm so very excited about this place. Having come from New Orleans, I know what a po boy is supposed to be. And contrary to popular belief, it ain't just another name for a submarine sandwich. The bread has to be light and fluffy, with a very thin, almost brittle outside crust. Po Boy's has the staples: an array of fried fish, shrimp, even oysters or roast beef. The best part is that the fish is fresh and fried to order, you see the whole fish on ice in the front fish market area. I assume you can also just buy fish here to cook yourself, like any normal seafood market. I had the flounder po boy, cajun seasoned, dressed with lettuce, tomato and their cajun mayo remoulade sauce. It was hands down the best po boy I've had since I left Louisiana. I also had a lowcountry soup, with sausage, shrimp and corn and it was good. But the star of the show was the killer sandwich. I'm so happy to have found a place where I can order a real po boy. I'll be back, and probably pretty often."}
{"text":"Hello Friends,  I've bookmarked, road passed, talked about and whatever else this place for some time now. I'm not really on this side of town unless I'm working. Yup, that's my ONLY reason.  Well Saturday I went. Being the first time there I walked in an looked like a newbie. The ppl behind the counter ask if I needed help. In which I did. I've been back about 8xs. Everyone is/was very helpful and nice.  The prices are good/fair. I'm not really sure why the big difference in prices from a lot of different markets.  I'm just an average Joe so spending $$$ on a lb of tuna isn't gonna cut it. I just want to eat it, I don't want to sell it at my fufu  restaurant. A place on Selwyn Ave and a few others made me ask if the price included a personal cook.  Go enjoy,  TTFN"}
{"text":"Yelp never does me wrong I've driven past this place but didn't decide to stop until I read some reviews being from Boston I steer away from seafood here a lot. I ordered shrimp po boy... perfect from the bread, fresh lettuce , tomato and the shrimp...been back almost monthly the past year."}
{"text":"I love seafood and this place does not disappoint!  I had the steam pound of shrimp with 2 sides and it was all fresh and delicious. I typically manage my expectations with side dishes but the sweet potatoes and green beans were amazing.  The shrimp was fresh, I had it steamed with old bay seasoning. I will definitely be visiting again to try other items on their menu!!"}
{"text":"The fish is always hot and fresh.  This time I had the shrimp PO Boy. The shrimp was flavorful, crispy and not over battered. They put the sauce on the bottom of the sandwich which is perfect. They also gave extra sauce on the side. Between the sauce and the shrimp was shredded lettuce and sliced tomatoes. Although it was a shrimp PoBoy it's the bread that steals the show. That french bread is EVERYTHING. I lived in Louisiana for 2 years the bread here is real deal"}
{"text":"Really glad I find this place. Being from a waterfront city it was hard not being able to get fresh seafood like I was used to. This place reminds me of the seafood markets back home. If I could say anything it would be about the charge for cooking the food. Back home they charge $1 per pound and here they charge $2, but ultimately I guess it is what it is. The food taste great so that takes the sting out a bit for the pricing. I guess I'm just spoiled and have to get used to the prices here. I've been here more than once and definitely recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"Walked in and was immediately greeted! This place is truly a gem. I ordered a piece of whiting which was huge and 4 scallops and my bill was only $9! This is the definition of a lot of bang for your buck! Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Brandon took my order and was super nice, we chatted a bit about Pittsburgh and banana allergies. Very nice guy!   I had the low country boil, it was seasoned just right and so good. The hush puppies were delicious. The corn in the boil was just ok.   Real nice little spot with picnic bench seating, and an awesome fish selection!"}
{"text":"We recently got lunch to go from here after hearing that it was good. I got a shrimp poboy (salt and pepper breading) with poboy sauce. My husband got the catfish poboy (Cajun breading) with poboy sauce. He also was excited to see Cracklin on the menu and ordered a small size of them with bbq seasoning.   Wanting to try different things, we split our Poboys so we could sample both. We agreed that both were fresh and super tasty. I would have liked a little more poboy sauce but it was otherwise, perfect. I liked the shrimp best and my husband liked the catfish best.   My husband was a bit disappointed that was was called cracklin on the menu is actually pork rinds. He liked it (although his wished it had more bbq seasoning) and said he would get it again but prefers actual cracklin and had his hopes up.   Overall- tasty and reasonably priced. We are fans!"}
{"text":"After a long morning of digging through the bins at the Goodwill Outlet my stomach was talking to me and seemed to be telling me that it couldn't wait the 15 minutes it would take to get home but that I would need to find a closer option. So I did what any respectable hungry person would do in that situation.....I opened up my Yelp! app and did a nearby restaurant search...Ooooh what is this?! A po'boy spot?! But where? and why had I never spotted it before ( I would later find out because it has only been open for 3 months). It was an off time of day, 4pm, so I rang em' up to check that they weren't just a lunch spot (yelp didn't have their hours listed). The friendly voice on the end of the line assured me that they were open until 8pm. Yessss.   Already having been hooked by eying a pic of the oyster po'boy I knew this was what I was getting. But the offer to \" You Buy We Fry\" for the various fresh fish was also a very tempting option for future visits. You get several options for the fry of the oyster. Cajun, S&P and regular I believe were the options. Then you can choose po'boy sauce or mayo as a sauce. I chose cajun and the po'boy sauce. Duh. The very enthusiastic girl behind the counter assured me that the combo I chose was also her favorite. I almost got one of the made-in-house sides, green beans perhaps, until I was informed that the sandwich was HUGE. Next time.  The size was indeed over ample, and the taste was on point. Perfectly seasoned fry on the oyster, not to mention a generous amount of the plump suckers, 8 If I am not mistaken. The bread was great as well, perfect balance of soft and chewy. It could have easily been split between two people, but not being one to cower away from a challenge, I finished the entire thing solo. However, not without regrets and the need for a nap.. zzzzzzzz"}
{"text":"This is the first Po Boy sandwich I have had in Charlotte and it did not disappoint. The cajun seasoning and Po Boy sauce were on point. The low country boil was also amazing and had just the right amount of kick to it. I will definitely be referring friends to try this!"}
{"text":"I'd never had a po'boy before, but I'm sure glad I did at this little gem!  The staff were so friendly and were very helpful when making recommendations for my first po'boy. I ended up going for the fried shrimp po'boy and a side of cracklings. The sauce on the po'boy was delicious. (I'm partial to mayo-based sauces anyway.) The fried shrimp weren't greasy at all, and the breading was light and flavorful -- really just perfect. The bread was great, too. Very soft with a crispy crust.  If I lived in the area, I would LOVE to buy fresh seafood from them, too. I feel spoiled with seafood up here in Boston, but the South definitely has seafood worthy enough to be on par with what we have up hear!  Do stop by this place if you're looking for a tasty Southern seafood meal and pleasant staff to boot!"}
{"text":"Accommodating, fresh, crispy, seasoned and just down right delicious. This is the spot to go to. Pick your own fish or shrimp. Even the bread was toasted to perfection. I absolutely love this place. Skin off sauce on the side, you name it and the staff delivers."}
{"text":"Soooo fresh and sooo good!! Very friendly staff! Very fresh seafood! Love the option for you to take home or they cook it for you!!"}
{"text":"This is our once a month lunch stop after shopping in the Value Village across the street and while im not the biggest po boy fan I find their sandwiches to be quite tasty. I would love a more generous portion of shrimp, the bread over powers. But since I have nothing to compare it too I honestly dont know if that's just how it's supposed to be. The staff is always pleasant. The place is always clean. You would never think you're stepping into a fish market."}
{"text":"When I first pulled up, I wasn't sure what to expect. Once I entered into the place, I didn't want to leave. I love the interior decor. It's super cutesy and nautical. I loved that while I knew it was a fish market, it certainly didn't smell like one.  I've certainly had better po boys after living near NOLA friends. However, I will not discredit the fresh offerings found here! The service is extremely personable with a flare of southern hospitality.   The prices were reasonable. I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best seafood I've ever had in charlotte. I am addicted!"}
{"text":"I must admit, PoBoy's has impressed me beyond belief. I can't believe we were afraid to walk in here lol I was completely blown away when I found such a fresh fish market so close to home!!! You can purchase whole or have it gutted and even fried! They have regular seasoning or Cajun seasoning. Everything also looked very fresh with clean containers and ice everywhere, they take their precautions. I'll be picking up fish fillets from here moving forward.   As for the food, also wonderful! I ordered the fried shrimp Poboy while the bf had the fried chicken poboy. We also got a small side of okra to split and a small banana pudding. We were having a movie marathon and really didn't want to leave so we stocked up. And stocked up indeed as the portion sizes here are insanely big. The Poboys are served on a hearty 9\" hoagie roll while the \"small\" fried okra side we got was enough for 3 people. We were very stuffed before even opening the okra. First off, I love the Cajun seasoning for your fried items! Everything was freshly fried without excess oil or grease, nice! The sandwiches were packed with our protein of choice with lettuce and tomatoes. The okra... Has got to be the best fried okra I've ever had hands down!!! Like shut the front door good! So fresh on the inside, I'm guessing they do not use frozen okra, and perfectly crispy on the outside. The banana pudding was very good as well, apparently they bring in desserts from local bakeries.   The staff was wonderful, she took time with us and explained everything since we were noobs. Great people. My recommendations: Make the Po sauce a little spicier, had to add siracha, and invest in steam/heat friendly takeout containers. The styrofoam will melt! Fan them open in the car ride home so you don't eat plastic! Regardless, we will for sure be back for more! Yay for PoBoy's Low Country!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The staff was helpful and very friendly. I ordered a meal as well as some fish to take home and cook later. I was pleased with the selection. I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"So after reading another's review I was convinced I needed to go here and try out the fish. I love fish and hate cooking it because the entire house smells like it until it airs out. First let me start by mentioning the owner is very hands on he comes out to everyone's table ask how are they enjoying the food and if it's anything you need. The setup here is like a fish market, so you could actually go in and order fish, crab legs, etc to go. I ordered the flounder Po boy sandwich with fried oakra and lemonade. Everything was ok it wasn't sink down in my chair good but it did the job.  I Will revisit and try some other things on the menu in the future."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise that I find via Yelp (surprise!) when searching for a good lunch spot. You first walk in, and it looks like just a seafood shop, but then you look at the menu and they tell you they will even fry something up for you from the case. I came for a po-boy, and I got a catfish po-boy. My only complaint was the basic hoagie roll . Wish was a little more like a traditional New Orleans po-boy roll. But otherwise, great fry on the fish, and good sauce. The fried okra was AmAZINg!! Portions are big, so come hungry!!"}
{"text":"Do not allow the bad part of town nor the looks on the outside of this diamond in disguise fool you! This place is great hands down. Wonderful atmosphere, wonderful customer service, fresh seafood that you pick out yourself; cooked fresh with your choice of regular, cajun, or salt & pepper breading fried to perfection. Don't miss out... I promise you'll love it."}
{"text":"This have to be the best PoBoy in town!  I've tried the Gator, Crawfish, Shrimp, Oyster, and Fish, NO DISAPPOINTMENT AT ALL!  Everyone that has come to the place with me has fallen in Love."}
{"text":"I said in my tip that Saturday's are for checking out bookmarked joints and this Saturday was a winner, winner Po Boy lunch.  Hmmm... 1 star for not rhyming.  Seriously though, this place is on point in all respects.  Prices, friendliness and most importantly, good food.  Now, I'm only going on this one visit personally but all these other 5 stars can't be wrong.  Beyond the good quality fried shrimp on the Po Boy they got the bread right.  Little crisp on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.  I went kind of traditional with mayo but there is their Po Boy sauce along with ketchup, tartar and hot sauces available and i pretty much tried it all.  It was a beautiful day and I sat outside and in about 7 minutes, out came a guy with a tray of goodness.  I had the fries (crinkle cut) and slaw as sides and both were decent companions but the star was the sandwich.  They've got a seafood market too where the product looked fresh and the prices seemed reasonable.  They'll cook selections for you or pack it to go so you can do it up at home.  Po Boy's isn't in the neighborhood for me but it's a guarantee I'll find reasons to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. The best seafood in Charlotte hands down! The best po boy in Charlotte hands down! I've visited here maybe 7 or 8 times since they've opened and every time has been great. They season their fried fish and shrimp just perfectly. My favorite item on the menu right now is the catfish po boy. Please don't pass on the po boy sauce...it takes the sandwich to another level.   I've tried the low country boil, shrimp po boy, catfish po boy and I highly recommend all of these. Plus the service is always friendly. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Can't wait to go back. I'm so happy that the owner opened this restaurant in Charlotte!"}
