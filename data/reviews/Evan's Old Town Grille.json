{"text":"Evans - also known as \"our favorite restaurant\".  When my brother and sister-in-law were here visiting from Ohio we took them to Evan's.  My brother later told me \"if he lived out here, that would be his favorite restaurant, too\".  We are regulars!"}
{"text":"I went to Evan's for the first time last Saturday and the experience was great!  The place is a favorite with Boulder City locals for good reason.  The staff was excellent and very accommodating.  The food was tasty, well priced and of good quality.  The menu offers a variety of dishes from old favorites like Liver and Onions to specials like Saffron Risotto with Asparagus and Shrimp.  I had the risotto, which was perfectly cooked and delicious.  One of my fellow diners had the liver, which is a favorite of his and he couldn't have been happier.  They offer a full bar and a short, but good wine list.  Definitely, worth the trip to Boulder City!"}
{"text":"Overrated! We tried this place for lunch and dinner. For lunch, they have a decent Gyro and Rueben sandwiches for takeout. Dinner was another story. We made reservations for two a few days ahead. When we arrived, our non movable booth was too small in which to sit. They then wanted to seat us at the bar. Meanwhile, two other tables were open. Were told they are reserved. I asked them if they were going to Honor our reservation? After standing there awkwardly for a few minutes, they sat us at one of the two open tables. So now we are seated, but ignored for 5 minutes. Finally, when they come around for drink orders, we go ahead and order our meal, as we're not feeling very comfortable here. The tables are very close together and it was difficult to have a conversation without raising ones voice over the din. We both ordered the side salads instead of the soup. My wife's salad looked pretty good. Consisting of romain and iceberg lettuces. My salad (plate of weeds) was entirely different. After I picked off the weeds, I have basically no real lettuce to eat. I ordered the NY Strip medium, it came medium well. The side of pasta with meat sauce was blanketed by the overwhelming flavor of Olives...yuck! It was like a tomato-olive sauce, I couldn't eat it. My wife's salmon dish was nothing special with a very modest portion. Needless to say, this meal did not deserve coffee and desert.  This small 15 table place is overrated."}
{"text":"I loved the tilapia.  Superior service great food just try it.  Very accommodating staff for such a small place."}
{"text":"We loved this place. We're staying down the street at the Boulder Dam Hotel, which we're thrilled with, and they recommended Evan's for its Greek food (in spite of it being put in the Italian category by Yelp). We had the Greek salad deluxe with some garlic bread. It was perfect to share after a long day in the hot sun. (It was still over 100Â° at 9 pm tonight.) The salad containing chicken, feta, red peppers, lamb, onions, lettuce, olives, cucumber, and tomato was delicious with one of my favorite parts being the sauce. Overall this place not only has great customer service and a welcoming environment but also has an excellent, refreshing Greek salad (as well as a good Shirley temple)."}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the past few years and what I've noticed the most is how consistant it is.  It's always the same staff, same very curtious and polite service and the same good food.  I've had almost every dish on the menu and I haven't found one yet that I don't like.  On my most recent visit I ordered a gin and tonic and it was served in a fun size (pint) glass.  What a nice surprise.  There is nothing insanely over the top about Evan's, but on the other hand, nothing's screwed up.    They are closed on Sundays and Mondays.  Other days can be busy and I would recommend making reservations."}
{"text":"I usually don't eat salads, but because of yelp, I tried out the greek salad and it WAS good! good call guys! Of course I had to have my side of meat. Rack of lamb. Also good!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The rack of lamb is my favorite!  Also love the chicken pasta with the artichoke hearts.  The staff is amazing and the food consistently wonderful.  It's our favorite place to go for dinner in BC."}
{"text":"Visiting Boulder City and came to Evans base on Yelp reviews, great choice. We shared the rack of lamb, it was excellent, tender, flavorful and perfectly prepared. The Greek salad was very good as were the side veggies.  The service was prompt and friendly; but not overly so. A very nice evening."}
{"text":"After a week paying high prices in Las Vegas for mediocre food finding and taking lunch here was like finding an oasis. Our waitress Cathy was wonderful. We had one of the specials which included a cup of soup. So good we three dinners had a desert. The baklava was wonderful."}
{"text":"We ate on a Wednesday when they had some Greek specials.  I had the half rack of lamb and it was prepared perfectly as requested medium rare.  The presentation was beautiful and the orzo was the most flavorful I've had.  The baklava was fresh and a little flaky; excellent.  We were surprised by some of the small details like the homemade ranch dressing that was delicious and light.  Our waitress was very pleasant and accommodating.  My kids enjoyed their meals and they are fairly picky eaters."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on yelp looking for Italian food. Never would have thought it with the name Evan's. Great find! Greek salad is awesome! Gyros had a very authentic sauce."}
{"text":"Everyone at this place is really nice. Unusually nice. But ok. I've only had the sundance pasta and it's my favorite. Def will go back."}
{"text":"the waiters/waitresses and bartender were super nice and friendly hard working people. each staff member said hello with warm trusting and honest smiles as they passed by my table, this says a lot about a small town restaurant. The food was pretty good. I'm a vegetarian and the vegetarian pasta dish was fine, maybe a little too oily for me but I'm sure it was better than most places nearby. The veggies tastes fresh but were swallowed up by the oil/sauce. Next time I'd get the sauce on the side. To be honest the friendly local vibe and small town ambiance was so inviting and warm, that I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place was divine. A wonderful place out away from the glitz of Las Vegas.  Actually a much better meal than stuff offered in Vegas.  Prices were wonderful, Cathy our waitress was superb, and we were so impressed, we also ordered dessert.  Yummy"}
{"text":"Restaurant gem in Old Boulder City. Food was delicious and reasonably priced. Service was excellent. We were not sure what to expect from the outside other than seeing positive reviews on Yelp. I would definitely recommend Evan's to anyone going to Old Boulder City. And would eat there again when anywhere in the area. Greek style (optional way of preparing) pork chops were perfectly done. The deboned Greek style trout was delicious as well. They're baked potatoes we're done perfectly. We chose Greek style salads and were glad we did."}
{"text":"We were heading back from Hoover Dam and wanted to do a little window shopping in Boulder City. The proprietor of the House of Antiques recommended Evan's. What a great place.   We sat out on the patio because we could (below freezing back home). The owner stopped out to welcome us and took our drink order. She recommended their lemonade drink which my wife gives two thumbs up. Her staff was attentive and friendly.   My wife ordered the light Salmon with almondine sauce. She loved it. I had the Chicken Southern. The spice was perfect and the lime juice added a little more zest.  While we skipped dessert, the second round of drinks kept us there until the Dillinger's band began to play across the street. Nice small town feel. We will be back."}
{"text":"Love Evans... The food and service is the best. As many times as I have eaten there and tonight found another favorite dish. Wednesday night is Greek specials. Always something new and delicious."}
{"text":"The southern is my favorite. I recommend Evans Old Town Grill to everyone. It's an excellent restaurant that provides great service and delicious food. Next time your in Boulder city, give it a try."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best restaurant in Boulder City. The staff is wonderful and the food is excellent. I eat here at least twice a week."}
{"text":"Exceptional Food and Limited Dining which results in a more Personal Dining Experience. Highly Recomended. A+++"}
{"text":"Very good , cozy restaurant. Cute town!! Nice change from Vegas overpriced, mediocre food!!"}
{"text":"Very authentic and special place for a small town great food and good service we will come here again definitely"}
{"text":"Excellent meal. Try the southern chicken pasta dish for something a little different.  Southwest / Greek fusion. Friendly staff. Good prices."}
{"text":"Evan's Old Town Grille - Best Steaks In Town - Authentic Greek Cuisine - They Cook Better Than My Greek Mother!"}
{"text":"Great dinner - we sat outside and enjoyed the warm night and beautiful sunset.  After a day of hiking and being outdoors, this no-fuss spot put on the best dinner I'd had for my entire trip in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"Went to Boulder City because we have never been there.  Loved Boulder City, we decided to stop, and get something to eat.  We saw \"Evan's old town Grill, and decided to try something from there.  The place was a little small, so you can hear everyone's conversation.  We all got the Greek salad, which was outstanding, feta cheese, fresh vegetables, and this dressing was out of this world.  I had the special lobster ravioli, it had lots of filling, and was a huge portion size.  My husband had the prime rib, now this prime rib looked like it came from the Stone Age, but it was so good I would order that the next time we are there.  4 stars only because they forgot to give me my leftovers."}
{"text":"1st time to visit this quaint, comfortable and casual place - and.....I will be back!wife ownership Owner was there assisting with all aspects of the restaurant/bar! I visited on Valentine's Day 2017 and it was busy - however, our waitress, Sheila, managed to keep us happy by frequently checking in on us - in addition to her being attentive, she was gracious, patient, detailed, and smiled the entire time!   While I must admit the food wasn't phenomenal, just average, the service and the price overcame everything else!"}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE! WE have been coming here for years. It is a family favorite. The service is great and waitresses are friendly. The owner is nice. I am vegetarian and they will allow substitutions and have a few options to choose from."}
{"text":"Great little place we found for lunch after visiting the Hoover dam. Not an extensive lunch menu but SUPER YUMMY FOOD. We all cleaned our plates! Attentive service too. We had the gyro, Greek salad, Rueben (with turkey) and fish and chips (special of the day). Quite pleased with this little gem."}
{"text":"Food was a bit overpriced, and nothing special.  I expected some artistic license with the greek italian combo, but it was just glorified tv dinners.  Waitress was nice though, and cool vibe with the red lighting!"}
{"text":"We came here because my wife loves the lamb chops. We were shocked, food was AMAZING, service was EXCELLENT. The Greek salad was authentic and light. I gambled on the liver and onions - he cooked them better than my grandmother. The server was on point, brought the food at perfect intervals, and really made our dining experience a great one."}
{"text":"Ok, I have only been here once, but I will be trying it out again. I heard many great things about this place from all the Boulder City locals and they were right on. The plates are plentiful and you get a great amount of food for the price, plus apps. I had the Veal Marsala special for the day and it was great. My friend had the Prime Rib and the cut was HUGE with bone in. I was startled by the quality, choice of sides, consistency and prices. They also have a full bar. Big bonus is that it is family run, consistently busy and the staff were all great and friendly. They even offer a great catering service as I have been told by the locals as well."}
{"text":"This was a great dinner at a very reasonable price. I had perfectly cooked Greek chicken and my husband had one of the best pieces if Princeton he's ever had. The staff was nice and friendly and the service was great. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The \"house social\" was over cooked bland vegetables with a pasta in a tasteless pesto sauce.  Cubes of cheddar and Swiss cheese turned out to be cut up strips of processed yellow and white cheese slices.  The atmosphere and service were fine."}
{"text":"Very good home cooked American and Mediterranean food    I will drive up from Henderson to go here again !"}
{"text":"Very good food! I got baklava and chicken cordon blue twice and it was delicious, friendly wait staff and good atmosphere. A little noisy though."}
{"text":"Mixed impression my first time here. Food was tasty. Buttery garlicky fresh artichoke appetizer was great but choke was not removed, requiring messy surgery at the table to get to the heart.  Grilled trout was tasty, but dorsal pin bones were not trimmed off, which diminished the experience.  Greekish side salad was excellent.   They couldn't have worked harder to hustle us out quickly . Main course was served while we were still working on the appetizer. We had to repeatedly tell the otherwise pleasant and efficient server to put our plates back on the table. She actually took my plate away in mid-bite, as I was lifting food to my mouth.  Boulder City is not known for fine dining, and the food here was pretty darn good, so I would eat here again.  However, I will confront them about the bum-rush if it were to happen again."}
{"text":"Holy crap, I finally found a great place to eat in Boulder City!    I travel through this area fairly regularly for work, and I love Boulder City, despite my Abbeyesque attitude toward dams.  But I haven't had great luck with the restaurants here, so I keep trying something new every time I stay.  I think I finally hit the jackpot!  This place had the best damned spanikopita I've ever had in my life.  Next time I'm in Boulder City, I may just come here and get five orders of spanikopita.  The Boss mumbled something about it needing more layers of phyllo, but he certainly didn't hesitate in consuming his half of the appetizer.  And why would you want more phyllo when you can have more delicious spinach and cheese?    I think we'd have appreciated our entrees more if we hadn't stuffed ourselves with the amazing spanikopita.  Have I mentioned enough times yet how awesome the spanikopita was?  The Boss had a vegetarian pasta type thing, which he enjoyed.  I had a gigantic, bloody rare prime rib and baked potato with butter and sour cream, which Boss probably did not enjoy watching me eat.  But I sure as hell enjoyed eating it.    The prime rib was very slightly tough (possibly my fault for ordering it rare), and it didn't come with au jus.  Those are my only *extremely* minor complaints.  I'd have given Evan's 4.9 stars if that were an option.  I ate every last bite of that leftover prime rib with my bare hands on the road home the next day, and I thoroughly enjoyed every last molecule of it.    Evan's will be my preferred dinner place in Boulder City from now on."}
{"text":"My mom told me about this place a few months ago, and we finally made it out on a Wednesday night for Greek Night.  Wow was she right!  We had the greek chicken and spanakopita. (I'm sure I spelled that wrong! :)) Everything was wonderful! Sarah was the sweetest server ever, and the food was perfect.  It really is just a quick drive out to Boulder City. You forget how close it really is. I'm sure we'll be back again soon!  Evan's may be our new spot! Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"The bread sticks were extremely hard!  When told the guy brought a new basket of great bread sticks.  The fork accidentally got taken away with the salad.  The server did not give another fork he kept forgetting.  The nice customer beside us gave us his.  The filet mignon was like a burned piece of cardboard.  They were great with the kids menu and subbing mash potatoes for French fries.  The price was not worth the food!!  Disappointed!!  Whole family gives 5 - stars."}
{"text":"Came here on the advice of some other Yelp reviews, and definitely a great choice. Had the Chicken Sparta which was amazing, along with the Greek Salad as a starter.  Small place with huge taste and spot-on service. Won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Prime Rib... this one was amazing. 3 people with drinks, entrees and appetizer... $68. And it was amazing. Fast service. Friendly staff. I'll definitely come back. Took 30 minutes to get there from be Strip. Worth the drive. Close to the Hoover Dam too."}
{"text":"VERY disappointed and Our 2nd time eating at this restaurant.  I ordered Filet Mignon and mom had the Salmon, Mine was way overcooked and I NEVER send food back. I ate half of it and was too dry to finish, I did not complain or act rude in any way when asked if I would like to take it home. I simply stated \" No thank you it wasn't very good\" Waitress asked why and I tell her it was overcooked with a smile.  Evan told the waitress to remove 2 beers from my bill. Moms salmon was luke warm if not room temp. I spent $80.00 last weekend and will NEVER go back, I also recommend if your not a local who keeps Evan in business eat elsewhere because Henderson is only a couple miles down the road!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in the Las Vegas area.  I just love their Gyros, and the Gyro salad.  Great place for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"This was a cozy little restaurant in the middle of Boulder City. The menu is comprised of mainly Italian and Greek fare. Our server was great. She handled our party of six flawlessly and remained attentive and upbeat throughout our stay. I had one of their specials of the day which was Tilapia with spinach and feta with a side of pasta in clam sauce. The food was tasty and portion extremely fair for the price of $14.95. Each of their main courses comes with  a choice of soup of the day or salad (greek or tossed) and as a side you can choose baked potao, fries, or pasta. If you choose pasta you have several different options of sauces and style. Wine list isn't terribly extensive but sufficient. If i was in the area again I would have no problem sampling more of their menu. All in all, everyone in our party left satisfied with their meal and service."}
{"text":"We were recommended this place by an owner of an antique store down the street and it didn't disappoint. A great gyurro, friendly staff and all around solid value."}
{"text":"We have attended the Wine Walk twice now and decided to eat at Evans afterwards because it always smells so yummy. I went with the Greek salad (yum) and the chicken parmesan and garlic noodles (so-so, the chicken wasn't crispy and the garlic noodles were not garlicky but they were watery) my husband got the Caesar salad (he sent it back, twice. Once because it was swimming in dressing and the second time was because they just put two more pieces of lettuce on it to make it less drenched) he also ordered the chicken cordon bleu which was taste less and the Mariana sauce on his noodles was tart and tasted canned. Our waitress at the end said, and I quote, \"wow, it seems like you did not enjoy your meal at all. I'm sorry\" but did not offer to get us anything else or to take care of the bill. We ended up paying about $40 for a salad and two bites of our meal- since that is all we ate. We were really disappointed. Don't think we will be going back."}
{"text":"We're just out traveling around and have been on the road for three weeks. We decided to try Evan's based on the previous reviews here and, boy, are we happy! Wait service, atmosphere, food quality, and value for$ are all great. Serving size was large, I couldn't finish and that's VERY unusual for me. We split Mississippi Mud Pie for desert and it was good too. Just go there!"}
{"text":"We stopped in at this little restaurant on the recommendation of the hotel concierge, at the Boulder Dam Hotel where we were staying.  It was a little dark and cozy, but it was busy and that was a good sign.  We had some wine and relaxed while people came and went.  The locals ate there (lots of regulars were in - you could tell because the hostess knew everyone's names and what they wanted to drink as soon as they got in the door) which is always promising for a restaurant.  Since I wasn't going to get my annual chicken parmesan in Vegas this year, I thought I'd give theirs a try, with a side of greek salad and a baked potato.  The salad was lightly dressed, a nice opening to the meal, and everyone got a fresh hot and fluffy breadstick with butter.  The chicken was a nice large piece of juicy meat, not overly-breaded with generous sauce that included little meatballs!  The cheese was a good portion too, definitely went well with the chicken.  It was delicious.  The green beans were a little overcooked for me, and there was some zucchini as well which was nice.  The baked potato was HUGE with loads of sour cream (my favourite topping naturally).  For dessert I tried their tiramisu which had a nice light coffee flavour but a unique maple-twist to it.  I swear they used something maple in it because that really stood out in the aftertaste and it was amazing!  Not something I'd have thought would work with tiramisu but next time I'm there, I'm definitely getting those again!  Looking forward to stopping by that cute little italian restaurant next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Nicely decorated inside, small, tablecloth covered tables, full bar. Seating is pretty tight, but manageable. Clean and nice. We arrived as they opened for dinner, and as we dined, the place filled up. It reminded me of the kind of place you would take your grandma to, and some people looked to doing exactly this.  I was craving beef and wanted a steak or something like it. I ordered the prime rib (18 oz) that came as a full meal for just under $20.00!  Such a deal in such a nice little place. Dinner came with soup or salad, bread sticks, vegetables, and choice of baked potato, pasta or french fries.  Everything was great. Food came hot, service was attentive. If I were a local, this would be my go-to place for some nice sit-down dinner food. The menu selection is nice, Split service can be obtained and includes extra soup or salad and extra choice of baked potato, pasta, or French fries for only a few bucks extra.  Parking is available on the street. Lunch is served. The restaurant closes between 3 and 4 p.m.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Came in tonight for the first time. Amazing food and incredible service. Had some of the best pasta I've ever had. Definitely one of the best places in Boulder City."}
{"text":"I had an hour to kill, so I stopped by this little restaurant. It was so warm and welcoming. I asked the waitress for suggestions and she recommended the linguini with butter and garlic with sun dried tomatoes.. I wish I could remember her name, but I did thank her for that awesome suggestion it was beyond delicious!! And service was awesome too! I will return to try another awesome suggestion"}
{"text":"Went here with a group for my mother-in-laws birthday. AMAZING FOOD!! Service was attentive (but not annoyingly so), the owner came around and greeted us which was a nice touch.  Red tablecloths, cloth napkins, fantastic wine selection - and I let the waitress give me a recommendation.  I had the Ultimate Greek Salad with Lamb, hubby had lamb chops, the chicken and lemon soup was super delish.  Boulder City might be a drive for some, but the atmosphere and food are definitely worth it - hands down best Greek food I've had in years."}
{"text":"This is literally one of the best restaurants I've been to in Nevada in two years.  Including all the fancy places on the Strip and around Vegas.  The food is THAT good!  We were there on a VERY busy night, some festival in town and a street party in front of the place, not to mention we came in just before closing and we were still blown away.  My wife had fish and I had lasagne.  Just absolutely amazing!  I don't think you'll find a bad thing on the menu.  The staff is amazing, the atmosphere is great and the food is unbelievable.  Just go."}
{"text":"Excellent Service!  Very tasty Reubens sandwich.  Wonderful Greek Salad.  One of the best I've ever had.   The gyro was good but a bit dry.   A very pleasant lunch in one of the cleanest little cities we have ever been in.  Boulder City Nevada is a gem"}
{"text":"Don't know what they could have done to make dinner for 14 people better!  I was a little concerned when we went through a residential neighborhood and a park to get there; but everyone in our party took it in as an adventure.  We couldn't have been more pleased, drinks, appetizers, dinner and desert for 14 people all our food came out together, was excellent and service was fab, the price very reasonable. I would highly recommend this restaurant and can't wait for an excuse to visit Boulder again, the choice to bring 14 people to a restaurant I have never eaten at was easy with Yelp reviews and I have never been let down."}
{"text":"Some good friends invited me out to dinner last night. This was exceptionally exciting because he is a tour guide, leading people around Las Vegas, Boulder City, and various parts of California. So, when they offered to take me out I knew that I had done the research and it would be a delicious surprise. But I had no idea that it would be this delicious!  Evan's Old Town Grille, situated in the quaint and quirky town of Boulder City, brings a unique Greek feeling to the place. It is a small restaurant, perfect for long conversations, multiple glasses of wine, and that feeling of being one large family. At the end of our visit the owner even made the rounds by all of the tables greeting customers as if they were old and dear friends.  If that is not enough to make you want to visit, then surely the food will! The greek salad has tremendous flavors, filled with olives, feta and fresh tomato. I tried one of the specials for the evening, the Tilapia with dill, and with each bite my tastebuds were singing. The vegetables were roasted to perfection--a hard feat for zucchinis and squashes somedays--and the greek style potato was like a baked potato I had never had before with seasonings roasted into it. There were a few points in the dinner where we were speechless because the food was that good. My culinary companions tried the Lamb Chop special and the Shrimp Scampi. Both said that their meals were delicious, and from the look of how large the shrimp were, I could see why.  For desert we tried a little bit of everything. The chocolate mouse, the limoncello, cheesecake with berries, and (of course) baklava. Needless to say, I needed a wheelbarrow to exit the building, but every bite was well worth it. If you are one who only eats one dessert, then my recommendation leans towards the baklava and the chocolate mouse. However, you can not go wrong with any of them."}
{"text":"Really good food, family atmosphere.  Every time I'm in Henderson, I make my way to Evans.  Liver and onions is killer, like my grandma used to make."}
{"text":"Food was all good. Prime rib was nice, but kinda salty. The Lobster Ravioli was good, but not special.  Waiter was trying very hard, but seemed overwhelmed with the business.  We will go back and try it again, because we enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"Spent the last several days in Vegas and had the opportunity to eat at several \"fine\" restaurants with some exorbitant prices. None of those meals came close to the quality and value we experienced tonight at Evans. Hope we have the opportunity to eat there again in the future."}
{"text":"Not a fan, and we won't return. Very crowded, extremely, deafeningly noisy, and the food was nothing to write home about.  My Greek salad was swimming in a pungent oily dressing, vegetables were overcooked, the salmon was ok, but the pesto was strange and had a very off-putting taste, no taste of basil or pine nuts or garlic or Parmesan - so why call it pesto? My husband's \"grilled\" pork chops had been dipped in flour and cooked in oil on the flat top - that's not grilled. The final insult - they were out of baked potatoes by 7:00!! Poor planning for the Friday night of a big holiday weekend.  The locals may love this place but we were not impressed."}
{"text":"I was astonished at the delicious food that was served in this outdated looking dining room.  Don't let the ugly outdated dining room scare you.  The food is spectacular (I have eaten at Michelin star restaurants). It is a rare thing to find a dining establishment which serves orange roughy!  This is one of the flakiest and delicious fish out there and they have it at this place.  There were 4 of us at the table and our family is in the habit of sharing each others entrees.  All of our entrees were delicious.  If you are in the area you must eat at this establishment!  Prices are a bit on the pricey end but the food is worth the price."}
{"text":"Eh.  The food is not horrible but nothing special. Terrible wine list. Owner is kind of rude."}
{"text":"Decided to take a drive out to Boulder City today, it's one of our favorite places to visit when the crowds of Las Vegas get to be too much.  We'd never eaten here and thought we'd give this place a try. Peeking my head inside to see what the place looked like I noticed a peculiar smell. Not totally unpleasant just different. I thought we'd give it a try anyway, but opted to sit at one of the outside tables.  I did use the restroom while here and found it to be clean and sanitary.  We both ordered our meals. I ordered the club sandwich, My girl ordered a gyro. Both meals came some sort of a thick chicken rice soup with a lemon taste. The soup was good until my girl discovered a hair in hers. That kind of turned me off on eating anymore of it. We let that slide cause a random hair can happen now and then.  The sandwich was very good as was the gyro. Both servings were very large and filling. Neither of us could finish them. The waitress, after learning we planned on being in Boulder City for awhile, offered to put the leftovers in the fridge for us to pick up later. We declined but it was nice of her to offer.  So other than a hair in the soup and a little odor, which may be because it's an old building, not a bad place for lunch."}
{"text":"More of a Italian food place but good food, the service was great. If you get there before 3pm you can get sandwiches otherwise it's pasta, steaks and entrees only."}
{"text":"Really good food, really good service. We ate outside where there are tables because we had our dog. The Clam Chowder was very good, my Turkey & Avocado was served with anti-pasta and the Mrs, who is a vegetarian had the Vegetarian Sundance. It was all very tasty. We were the only ones outside and yet we were not forgotten."}
{"text":"Yum! Great service here guys. We had the pesto-feta pita as an appetizer which we were super pleased with! Two of us had the special which was the French dip; was OK. Bread was a bit soggy for not having been the traditional dip and the meat was more of a Lunch meat than actual slices of cooked fresh meat. I would definitely return to try the regular menu items though. It seems like a genuinely all around good place to have a meal or event a drink and some appetizers! I will definitely give it another shot!"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding restaurant, we've been here several times and never been let down! Prime rib is to die for, Greek salad is awesome. Prices are very reasonable and you get a ton of food. Service is top notch :)"}
{"text":"Found this wonderful restaurant from a menu at the Boulder Dam Hotel.  The Greek salad was huge and delicious. The lemon roasted 1/2 chicken  so tender and moist. So much food we had to take quite a bit with us. Stuffed pita with the chicken dish was a great compliment.  The dining room is packed with locals. Tables are close. Waitresses are attentive.  Next time we are in Boulder City we will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I live in Boulder City and have eaten dinner here twice. I honestly do not know how they accomplish a high Yelp rating. The staff is friendly but poorly trained with little knowledge of the menu items. Most of the food is frozen or canned and it's obvious . I'm no gourmet cook but I can easily outperform this place at home. The soup was not edible. The fish, very salty which is indicative of processed food. The bread straight from the supermarket . Steamed vegetable? No boiled to death. Best part? 2 people, no desert, 2 mixed drinks and no soft drink - $65 plus tip. I'm done...oh yeah, they were out of baked potatoes on Friday night at 6 PM.  The Dillinger is where you want to go."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to have a salad in Boulder City. Have been coming here to eat periodically for many years but sort of stopped because the veggies were always soggy and lifeless. Then a few weeks ago a friend suggested we stop in for an early dinner and I must say the veggies were cooked perfectly. So I've been back twice since then and am loving the Greek salad with grilled salmon with cilantro pesto. It's a perfect sized portion and just deliciously seasoned salmon. The salad is excellent with a generous dressing and feta cheese.  So, if you haven't been in lately, give them a try, friendly, efficient wait staff and a full bar."}
{"text":"This was the best meal we have had in the last 48 hours in the Vegas area. Gyro meal was fantastic. Tender beef/lamb, avgolemeno soup had great flavor, and service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. The server forgot my drink for half the meal. She just didn't bring it.  The prime rib was really fatty and cut pretty thin for prime rib.  The server also messed up my boyfriend's mom's food and brought the wrong food altogether. My boyfriend's risotto was not good at all either.  Will not go back... There are much better places to eat in Boulder City."}
{"text":"I suppose I could write a book on why we love this place but, in short, it's the atmosphere, the Friendly staff and the great food that makes this a place we like to treat ourselves to whenever we have the chance!"}
{"text":"Prime Rib was excellent. Not recommend if you want to dine with friends. Went with 4 couples and they wouldn't split our checks. Felt rushed and judged for asking for a beverage refill (only 1 w/purchase). Server questioned me for asking for more bread, \"I just wanted to get our table one piece per person\" party of 12. Staff talking about me in the kitchen, for asking if the kids meal came with dessert. Only asked since server advised my kids to save room for strawberry shortcake. Go to Dillingers across the street for great food, unlimited refills and awesome service. Plus split checks are welcomed."}
{"text":"Great great food. Mediterranean and Greek take on very current dishes. We had the spanakopita and stuffed pita appetizers. The Sparta chicken was amazing and the Greek pork chops were as good as my Greek mom's attempts at them. Very good dinner :)"}
{"text":"Chicken Alfredo and clam chowder were very good. Took a while to get the check."}
{"text":"WOW! We found this place through Yelp and I must say we are extremely impressed! Along with the EXCELLENT service, the place has EXCELLENT Prime Rib as well as the New York Steak. We ordered ours medium and medium rare and we got our food exactly as ordered. The baked potato is also really good, which was surprising because, well it's baked potato! The Chicken Parmesan is also a good recommend. Excellent food for about an average cost...not too expensive, but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Great Greek salad. Famous for Greek chef. The waitress was the world's best. Bill and I were tired from driving but this little local grill made our DAY. Large menu with Italian specialties   The hamburger was incredible  we sat and had wine and comfort"}
{"text":"The most amazing restaurant I've been to in years! Whatever they are doing is right.. I'll be back here a million times over!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place but I have been in a few times recently and the food is just not like it once was. The food is greasy and the service is slow. The menu is also pricey, I really do not understand expensive Italian food, how expensive are noodles? Anyway the food is not all that bad though the service is not really very good or prompt so this place garners a 3 star rating from me."}
{"text":"On the plus side, you can get unique items here like a gyro and turkey with avocado. And the wait staff is super nice. But when you fork over $8 or $9 for each entree you want fresh lettuce and fries right out of the fryer. I appreciate the fries were fresh cut, but that makes their state on arrival at the table all the more egregious.  As for allergies my very friendly waitress didn't write mine down and didn't catch that the fries had cheese sprinkled on top which made them no longer edible for me. Hubby admits that they might have been fried recently but the oil might not have been hot enough.  Too bad...I wanted to like them a whole lot more."}
{"text":"Don't know what the big deal here is.  No way this place is 4 1/2 stars.  the southern chicken was ok, same with the steamed clams.   everything was OK."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service.  Great value.  Old-school small restaurant where the owner cooks and checks on his customers.   Easy to see why they have been in business so long.  Pasta dinner with your choice of sauces and pasta with all the trimmings for less than ten bucks? Really?  Love this place - going back often!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner for the first time at Evan's the service was great and the food was great! I would recommend Evans if you want a nice dinner at a great price!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love Boulder City, but we have never driven down some of the side streets. We did this time and found Evan's Old Town Grille. Small town atmosphere with big time service, a great menu, and excellent food. This truly was a great dining experience. I couldn't resist the prime rib, cooked to perfection. Our service was so quick, but NOT rushed. And the place was pretty busy both inside and outside. Our waitress, Wendy....she was tremendous! Can't wait to get back there!"}
{"text":"I expected better... reading the reviews I had a chicken Gyro..I have had better and my other half had a Ruben sandwich   That was saturated with sauerkraut juice he had to cut it."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this restaurant. I have been coming here for years since I live fairly close to Boulder City. It is a cozy, family-owned restaurant and always offers quality service and quality food. Just what you expect for a nice meal out. I love their Greek salad and their chicken Sparta as well as their pasta dishes. I am so addicted to their toasted buttered bread. It is so simple yet it is so good! The desserts are fantastic as well. Especially the watermelon sherbet ice cream cake. So yummy! The owner, Evan,  is a great chef and an even friendlier man. This is a great place to dine at if you're looking to have a nice quiet date night outside of the typical Las Vegas scene."}
{"text":"If you want mom and pop gourmet cooking infused with casual subtle elegance go here. There is something sweet about this little place, the tables are close as it is small but somehow it seems intimate and not aggravating. The patrons have some class and do not talk too loud etc.  They give you choices of veggies which I love ( and its good veggies too like broccoli and zucchini) , the regular salad is unique but not a weird bowl of goo like some places will give you. It was fresh had beets and beans for a unique twist. They have nice Greek touches to some dishes , and the salad is great. The steak is great quality and superb. The dishes are put together with thought, and garnish. Nothing is just thrown on a plate here.  They have affordable board specials. You can eat here for 10 and up. Can't wait to try the lamb on my birthday. :)  The service is great, they know when to talk and when to leave you alone. The only drawback here is the parking. There aren't many spots without a small walk. The walk isn't far for most people but if you have health issues you may want to ask to be dropped off at the door just in case once the heat comes.   Clean, consistent and reliable. A real gem. Casual but in a classy way."}
{"text":"Quaint little place that caters to locals. I was not impressed with the food or the service. Had a pasta dish that a felt was out of a can. Noodles not cooked through and maybe sat too long cooling. were stuck together. Not sure we would go again."}
{"text":"Went in just for a Greek Salad, Yum  Appreciate the great service  thank you For making my lunch hour something to look forward to!"}
{"text":"There's always something for everyone at Evan's.  I'm a fan of the Greek salad, but my family always raves about the seafood.  The customizable pasta options are great for a carb splurge or for the kids.  Great wine selection and super friendly staff.  The place is usually full with a lively atmosphere that adds to the experience."}
{"text":"Went in after the beer fest for dinner 6 of us . We have been their three different times after the beer fest and was very good BUT this year it was like a new place wow the service was good but the food we ordered was bottom of the barrel and way over priced. 2 hamburger steak dinners that were so over done we could not Finnish them. 2 prime ribs one was ok the second very well done and didn't get the baked potato so they brought French fries at the end of the meal ?. 1 dinner was ravioli it had three small ravs hardly no Sauce . 1 dinner was chicken Parmesan it was ok . All the salads so much dressing it was running off the plates. And not 1 of these were priced under $15.00.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Went here with my mother and stepfather. Atmosphere was nice and quiet.  Our food was incredible. Mothers steak was perfectly cooked medium rare as she ordered it, and her and my stepfather's vegetables were cooked just right.  I had the \"Chicken Southern\", which was penne pasta with peppers in a spiced sauce. It tasted incredible.  We paid $90 which I think was worth the meal."}
{"text":"Evan is a complete gentleman and an amazing cook. We had an incredible sample plate with 4 different entrees all with flavor a that complimented each other perfectly. The salad starter with steak and feta was one of the best I've ever had. Highly recommend Evans!"}
{"text":"I can't begin to tell how terrific the food is here.  We were there with four others friends and we all raved about the food.  My friend & I had the Chicken Angelo - OMG so good.  One of the best dishes I have ever had (I'm in my 60's so that a lot of eating out).  My husband had the prime rib and loved it.  It was huge and very tender and cooked perfectly.  Two other friends had the mahi mahi and are still raving about it which is great since one of them is a very picky eater.  The last dish was the beef medallions which were also perfect.  I wish Evan would open a place in west Phoenix, I'd be there every day.  Evan stopped by the table to make sure everything was good and our waitress Wendy was fantastic.  What a great find in a small town.  LOVE IT!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great service and excellent food. Would definitely revisit."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants I've eaten at since being in Nevada. Nice blend of Greek and Italian food.  I ordered the Chicken Southwest and my sister ordered the Chicken Spartan. Both were REALLY good. Our server was great; really patient with my picky family. Hearty, great-tasting food that can please almost any palette"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I had high expectations for this place. Ok, I didn't expect Michelin star quality but I was hoping for flavorful, well prepared food. I must say I was disappointed.  We started with a \"steamed artichoke\".  Unfortunately it was soaked in relatively bland garlic butter.  A garlic mayo would have been better.   The lobster ravioli's my wife ordered tasted bland with no lobster flavor at all as it was drowned out by the cheesy filling.  The side vegetables were also without flavor.  Not to say the meal didn't have its moments.  The breadsticks were the best thing about this place, tastier than olive garden's.   My seven year old had spaghetti and meatballs and we all loved the meatballs' flavor.  I had the Ginger Lime Mahi Mahi and thought it was excellent.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  Although the pricing for each entree was under $20.00 I felt it was overpriced based upon portion sizes, blandness of the dishes and quality of side dishes.  Overall could have been better but next time I will hold off on the meal until we return to las vegas area."}
{"text":"Exactly what that other guy said about day of hiking + plate of yummy food (lots of yummy food) = just what the body needed. I was so thrilled with the number of breads, salads and sides that accompanied my fish! Cute charming little place."}
{"text":"4 of us for lunch after a recommendation from a man we met at the Elks Lodge last night.  The men had Reubens and loved them, us gals had the Gyros which the one I had the pita was burnt and it was very dry.  Loved the red bean and rice soup.  The service was great."}
{"text":"It is very difficult for me to post a bad review for this restaurant. The owner Evan, came over and spoke to us. Our favorite server, Wendy, was her perfect self. But when you find a fly in your salad, you expect an apology. And then a comped meal. Or a comped glass of wine. Nope. Didn't happen. That's just bad business."}
{"text":"The food was decent and the service good.  Would not make a special trip, but if in the area good choice.  We had lunch in the late afternoon, so that might have impacted the experience.  The soup was delicious and next time I think I would get the Greek salad instead of a sandwich."}
{"text":"stumbled upon this place after a trip to the dam. awful. its says Greek out side- but its a lie! i asked for falafel - they don't have it- the waiter offered gyro instead- because you know how similar they are?! i suspect the reason he offered it was because that's the only Greek thing on the menu.  everything else is pasta dish, which for some reason comes with a option of a baked potato? everything is over priced- we ordered a starter of garlic bread- what arrived was sliced sandwich bread toasted-on one side!! and smeared with garlic butter. nasty. my sister ordered a chicken pasta dish-which was a pesto soup of well done noodles and way too much oil, which when the waiter delivered it said-\" i don't know what this is\" , the gyro my husband ordered was the worst - the meat was not off a skewer- frozen ,processed and reheated nasty thick slabs of mystery meat- and the \" fries\" are frozen crinkle cut oven cooked mush. if your going to serve frozen oven baked fries from the grocery store- don't get crinkle cut! -leave some mystery with straight cut fries-i know your not crinkle cutting back there! when we left-my sister asked for to-go boxes ( why she would want to take this god-awful food home- i have no idea ) the server brought one small box for their two huge pasta dishes- a new party entered the restaurant- and we didn't see the waiter again. another server brought the check- with a pen from dollar loan center! don't give a customer a pen from dollar loan center to sign the check!- one can only assume dollar loan are how you are staying in business!!"}
{"text":"6 of us ordered lunch for the office today. The food was delicious and hot and didn't take long at all. Super friendly staff and affordable prices. Thanks again Evan! Keep up the great work. Hats off to the chef."}
{"text":"Last night I had the spaghetti with Italian sausage and it was awesome. The service was excellent and we didn't have to wait for a table. My husband had the chicken parm, and loved it. I will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"We explored the town Friday evening and found an excellent cafÃ© called Evans Old Town Grille for dinner and the Prime Rib covered half the plate for 15.00, the full plate not the special. You have to do this one time when you are in the Vegas area. It seems that everyone eats dinner and breakfast at the same time. So go early or call and ask to be  added to the reservation list"}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting from Pittsburgh, PA and Evan's was suggested to us. Well let me tell you it was a great treat. Service was excellent and the food was fabulous. I had the \"chicken southern\" a magnificent culinary delight to say the least. This place is Highly Recommended by my wife and I - you want go wrong here."}
