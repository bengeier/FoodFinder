{"text":"Place looked nice, thought we try it out...worst customer service ever, unprofessional...ordered chili chicken and butter chicken litterally 5/6 diced peices of chicken in the takeout jar...mostly just gravy...asked the girl too \"wheres the chicken ????\" She replied its in there checkk\" rudely so i stormed out and wont ever go back dont recommend it at all !!!"}
{"text":"Big mistake. No staff to greet us tonight. We just sat down and hoped for the best. We sat down. Still no one approached us. We got up and went to the buffet.  The rice was mass produced in a rice steamer.  Very tacky.  The desert was mixed with main foods. The quality of the food was 5 out of 10. Will not go back."}
{"text":"I went to this place without seeing the reviews first since it's right around the corner from my cousins. This place has THE BEST warm gulab jaman I have ever had in my life. I will never go to another restaurant for gulab jaman when I'm in the area. The food was good too, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Take out is great, I have always purchased thali and channa bhatura from here. The channa come with delicious chutney and achar. The service is okay as the staff sometimes speak a mix of English and Punjabi. They get the order right and on time. Ordering before hand is great as they ask when you will arrive to pick it up.   Would give them 5 stars but dining in was not good. It's clean and free but the service and place overall isn't great. The TV angles are not good from every table, only a select few. They don't offer any menus when you are seated, you must go order and tell them it's to dine in.  They don't come again to ask you if you would like more or refills."}
