{"text":"Great Pizza. A little more pricey than the other chains but definitely worth it.  Also I'd be willing to bet that Chris called the wrong location, as there is more than one in the Akron area. But he'll never admit that."}
{"text":"Romeos is an all around good northeast Ohio pizza chain.  The pizza is typically everything you would expect from a pizza.  Their sauce is on the sweeter side which I do like.  I have been ordering Romeos for several years now and have never been disappointed.  The staff and delivery drivers are friendly.  I grew up in an area that has a lot of first and second generation (straight off the boat) Italians so I am used to very unique pizzas.  Romeos fits the corporate model of a good pizza that is expanding their franchise."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Their toppings are great, and the crust is pretty tasty, but the sauce is too sweet. I do like the pizza, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price. Even with a coupon, it is pretty expensive. It's worth trying, but it's not my regular pizza place. Also, don't get the kitchen sink pizza. It sounds like it's going to be good, but all those toppings makes for a crappier pizza quality."}
{"text":"You would think that the people who worked at a pizza restaurant would have a piece of paper and pen to write down a simple order of a pizza with two salads... WRONG! Not only did I spend 20 minutes on the phone with these people to explain I wanted 2 salad and a medium mushroom, onion, and sausage pizza, but when we came to pick it up, YEP, YOU GUESSED IT! They didn't have our order! So then we proceeded to explain our order 5 more times to these workers who still looked at us as if we were explaining a chemistry equation to them.... What a production that was!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I've experienced from any pizza shop ever. We called to order a few pizzas for delivery and the woman on the phone was rude, bitter, and unprofessional. She was verbally abusive; frankly she sounded like she needs mental help. Not sure how she managed to slither past management, but if Romeo's wants to stay in business, they need to dispose of her.   She snapped argumentatively at everything we said while on the phone. Seriously, it's ordering two pizzas. How hard is that supposed to be? She gave us such bad attitude. The pizzas arrived cold and tasteless.   Will NEVER go back to Romeo's again. Nasty lady, should be fired."}
{"text":"Romeos is some good pizza. I like there pizza sauce, it is a little sweet. It is my favorite out of all the pizza chains in the area. I wish that they had more veggie topping to choose from, but they do have the meat eaters covered."}
{"text":"Bought a deep dish Italiano, 2 pounds of wings two flavors and some cheese bread. Did not expect much from the deep dish and that is what I got. Not much. Just some extra dough with sauce on top. Now the wings although good cost $9.99 a pound. No approximate number is specified on their website but I assume like most places it be around 10 a pound. I was wrong wrong. Six tiny wings that I doubt even weighed one pound cost $20. Cheesy bread was good nothing special again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Kent/Stow. Love their meatballs and fresh mozz. Buffalo Chicken pizza is amazing, too   Local chain which I highly recommend.  They deliver to Kent and offer online ordering.  ___  I see the Yelp automated software has excluded my review from the average rating, watching their little video its apparently because they don't think me qualified or don't frequent the place. For what its worth I have a degree from Johnson & Wales University and 7 years of professional kitchen experience, and this is my go to pizza spot and has been since 2012 - first the Twinsburg location, and now Stow. Take from that what you will. If I could review Yelp it would be a giant thumbs down."}
{"text":"Romeo's is one of my favorite places for pizza. Does it best Angelo's or Dewey's? No, but it's definitely the pizza spot I like to go to if I don't feel like venturing out to Lakewood.  The pizza crust is cooked perfectly, not doughy, & has a nice bite to it. It's not overly greasy either. The pizza sauce is sweet but I actually like that because it cuts down on the acidity of the tomatoes. My favorite toppings to get is pepperoni & the crumbled sausage, I like to keep it simple with my toppings...sometimes."}
{"text":"Romeos pizza is delicious. But every time I eat it I get diarrhea. I'm sick of this pizza giving me diarrhea."}
{"text":"Berea ohio -  okay people i know things are expensive, 1 medium pizza and 1 lb pound of wings, $25.00.  no substitutes.  If i am going to spend that much,  I rather go somewhere else and get a steak.  I know it is expensive to make a pizza,  haha.   But come people get real."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, I've eaten here several times and have always been happy. However, last time I ventured out and tried a speciality pizza (margherita pizza) and it was a total letdown. Way too much sauce globbed on, very little cheese, and swirled with pesto sauce. Not a fan!"}
{"text":"Don't go. You'll be sorry.  Little Caesars has crappy pizza, too. But at least they charge you like they should."}
{"text":"Not very good, if you like eating bread you will love it lacked toppings and sauce. This is the second time that I've given them a try, will not be going back to that location."}
