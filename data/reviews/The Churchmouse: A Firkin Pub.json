{"text":"Once my weekly end-of-the-week haunt, I have since abandoned the Churhmouse. When I first started eating here three years ago, the staff were incredibly attentive, personable, and professional. The food was plentiful and tasty. How times have changed.

\"So, are you done yet?\" is not what waiting staff should be asking a group of nine that is steadily drinking and has a record of tipping well. All of the best staff have left and been replaced with people who cannot recognize my group after weeks of serving us. This is on top of a major decrease in portion sizes.

The food is still tasty and their burger specials are excellent. However, the service is now really sub-par. I would like to dine in the Village more, but the attitude in the staff needs to change."}
{"text":"I went there for a social outing with my volleyball team and it was great. The host sat us in a booth and was attentive but not annoyingly which we appreciated. Just a quick is everything good? Need a refill? 

The food was awesome and the specials were will priced! I had the fish and chips and it was to die for. So tasty and the tartar sauce was great too.

The Butlers draft is well priced and goes down good with the pub food."}
{"text":"Been going here for years, so maybe you could consider me a regular.

The staff are great, and really that is what sets this Firkin apart from all the millions of other ones.

The Churchmouse is very active with the community, and all sorts of events take place there through the year.  Word of warning: if there is a church street event happening, the ChurchMouse will be jammed.

Like all Firkins, the menu is a bit lacking for those with eating restrictions (vegan, vegetarian) but its a pub so that shouldn't be a surprise.  Lots of specials, all the time, and their cookstaff are fantastic.

And they have guinness; what more could I ask?"}
{"text":"Meh.  The service here is OK at best. Food, on the other hand, goes downhill as the price goes up. The bangers & mash should be called bangers & instant. 

There are better options around--I suggest you try them."}
{"text":"Everything was great from the food to the service. 
We sat in the inside, but there was an outside patio and an upstairs. The food portions were large and the prices were reasonable. They also offered $5 pints!! 
Shout out to Mackenzie. Best server ever!!"}
{"text":"My favorite pub.... had brunch there for the first time... the pulled pork benny was awesome"}
{"text":"If you visit this place, take the name literally. I saw mice running around, and when I cancelled my order they laughed in my face. Worst experience, would never go back! Disgusting!"}
{"text":"My favorite Pride spot- the food is good, the service is friendly, and the bathrooms are clean even when super crowded- it's good money with me!"}
{"text":"A Grilled Cheese sandwich with bacon is just about heaven, and the Churchmouse made an excellent one today.

Top that off with awesome April weather and you have a jam packed patio with friendly servers and some of the best seats in the house. The best seats on the house, you ask?

Today, it was  a young naked guy across the street  who kept taking his pants off (then on, then off, then on,  then off) before finally walking out of view. A woman at the next table summed it up nicely when she said, \"Ah, Spring.\"

Embrace the sideshow that sometimes happens when you are out on the patio, and enjoy some great food."}
{"text":"The best pub in Boystown with a nice corner Patio to watch the boys and girls go by. Great staff and Manager Andrew is a Gem. Quiet upstairs room/bar in the winter months, Has daily specials which are usally better than their standard menu which is rather limiting."}
{"text":"Haven't actually eaten here, but love the atmosphere and the upstairs couch area. It's a great relaxing spot to have a drink after work."}
{"text":"Friend and I went for the Sunday Brunch. Specials were stilll on but I teally wanted eggs benedict. The only thing I can say is the hollandaise was separating but it was still good.
What made the day was our server, Cody. He was amazing. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A good central located, Brit-style pub, in the heart of the gay village. It has gone through some various changes over the years , though not a big deal at all: A couple name changes I believe (don't quote me on that), and it has also changed its interior decor and layout slightly a couple of times to, I assume provide more seating.  

That being said, the seating is tight , almost too tight for a quiet and private chat during peak hours. I have literally sat at a table, less than a foot from another table, bumping arms and legs, and trying desperately to get comfortable in such a tight and small area, and I am not by far, a large person.  

The outdoor patio on the north side of the restaurant is pleasant, especially in the dead heat of summer, if you are looking to eat while  checking out the street crowd. Of course, there is A/C indoors which is a pleasant balance. Take note : like indoors, the patio is much too small, much too tiny a space to, in my opinion actually enjoy dinner without again, smacking others or God forbid, bump into a waiter at full speed which I've seen happen. Personally, although it's fun to crowd watch, but just keep in mind you can literally have periods of anxiety from the very tight and not particularly comfortable furniture. 

Ok, the food and service. I have to admit, service is 100% completely hit and miss. At times, when there is seating on the second floor, me and my party of friends have been almost forgotten upstairs, for 45 minutes - be careful on how many staff actually do work upstairs. In contrast, I've had good customer service on the main floor , with our waiter only a smile away. It is hard to peg down the quality of the service. It could be better but it could always be much worse. Choose your seating carefully, almost strategically I think is good advice. 

The food , in my opinion is where the pub falls short of expectations. Now of course, it's a very standard fare, like ALMOST all other pubs downtown, i.e. a lack of something different, of variety, of uniqueness. Do NOT expect anything more elaborate than the regular burger or chicken fingers or a chicken sandwich smothered in gravy. But that's the type of food you are aware of in pubs. It's bar food, it's not a food that stands out in any way whatsoever. Quality ? I have had pure cold food before which eludes me for a restaurant. I find the food rather bland and have had to ask the waiter on 2 occasions to return it and actually cook the food. Maybe others have had better experiences with the food or feel the need for more variety is not an issue at all, especially if the food is more of a quick liquor lunch and some nachos before heading back to work or home. 

As for the range of alcoholic drinks, i.e. Beers, the again, standard fare, 100%, nothing unique sadly. The same can be said with the wines, with even more of a generic menu for those who would prefer wine. 

Lastly, the location is again a great location, the patio is very tight, but at least the patio is there to accommodate more people and the walk by crowd is always a fun, extra bonus to a few beers. Service is --- adequate, not terrible, not by any means glowing but again, it is a standard pub environment which you know instinctively when you see the restaurant and choose to dine there. 

All that being said , I think it is a good \"watering hole\" for the local community and it has been there for years now, which in itself on Church St. is a MIRACLE beyond words (the village has really suffered from high rents and so many great stores and bars are closed and long gone), so I would end my review and say that this pub has managed to keep itself in the same spot and it's always a place to plan around for some really basic eating out."}
{"text":"Disgusting attitude from the waitress. How you can now know what ingredients go into your food is disgusting from a customer service standpoints. And to couple it with attitude. Not coming in here again for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was ok. You walk in and someone is ready to help you out, \"upstairs or downstairs?\" I've always picked downstairs; I prefer to be in the eye of the hurricane. 

The food is alright but then again, I haven't had many of the pub fare specialities. Still, everything on the menu should be really good! I've tried the linguini and meatballs (which I found to be a bit dry), curry with warm naan (which I liked and was huge but expectedly was not a great curry) and French fries. Guess which one wins? The French fries! Obvi. 

The service, drinks and atmosphere make this place a wonderful place to be. I'd put the food in the backdrop of reasons to come, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't come and enjoy some good things to nosh on."}
{"text":"Great location, nice patio, decent food, nice eye candy. Decent service, free refills on pop and no extra charges for regular condiments. Chipotle mayo. Mmmm."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years now, and Churchmouse & Firkin is always a solid bet for a cold pint and a quick bite to eat. I always try to order off the specials menu as this usually ensures that the food is made fresh, rather than cooked from frozen.

Since they renovated, the patio and inside space is far more modern and trendy. They also have daily specials (both for food and drinks) and the new bar downstairs is very nice indeed.

After their recent renovations, they tried using a \"check in\" system inside the front door whereby you tell the host how many people you need seating for. This caused a lot of hassle in my experience and I think they have recently stopped this system for indoor seating."}
{"text":"Undercooked fries. Burger had thousand island dressing on it without mentioning that part on the menu. Tasted awful. When they rolled down the outside patio tarp, everyone on the patio got wet, due to the last time they rolled it up while it was still wet without letting it dry first. Server was friendly, and the patio is nice, but the most important part is the food, and that did not deliver."}
{"text":"A good place to sit and get a burger near Yonge Street.  The menu isn't that large, but they have standard fare and a wide selection of beer and other drinks.  The waiters are very friendly, helpful, and quick."}
{"text":"Bartender was very friendly, ordered Poutine as I had never tried it before since it is my 1st time to Ca.  He suggested to try the loaded poutine which included tator tots and upon receiving it I was not impressed with it (nothing special to me about fries covered in gravy).  Glad I tried it but wouldn't order it again if & when I come back to visit."}
{"text":"Apparently I'm a Firkin regular! They should give me frequent Firkin miles...hardi har har...

I was hard on the last Firkin I visited, but this one was great! Super duper friendly service from Teja (ask for her if you go), yummy comfort food, intimate setting and fun atmosphere.  The Firkin triple cheese bread is dangerously good...

Apparently the bar tender is usually pretty cranky, but soften her up with a few jokes and she's a hoot. We also tried to send a drink over to a cute guy, but the funny bar tender warned us against it because apparently someone had already tried and he refused! 

Anywho, thoroughly enjoyed my evening curled up in a booth with some delicious chicken fingers and fries! Extra plum sauce free!"}
{"text":"Has been our fav place on church and the renovated place is much better. But to scrimp on liquor on highly-priced cocktails is a no-no for any business. I paid $9 plus tax for a cocktail which was supposedly with 1.5 oz of vodka and knowing my liquor, I did not get 1.5 oz! Sadly, that is how businesses lose their long-time patrons. The week prior had gone for drinks to Cafe California and was pleasantly surprised with the martini, even though it cost the same. Yes, I am willing to pay $9 but the drink has to be awesome, just not laced with soda."}
{"text":"I was sitting out on the patio with my wife one night. We where having a great time having drinks. But then we saw a rat run under some of the tables. Never again will I go there. Thats just gross!"}
{"text":"Great beer, great service, great outdoor seating. However if you sit outside be warned about being hit up for money and cigs. We arrived late and were booted out... politely of course! I would definitely recommend and I WILL definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great upstairs seating, cozy and attentive service.  Wine is overpriced and limited, but good appetizers!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best firkin locations. It has a great patio for lovely days.  The drink deals are definitely a awesome price. 5 dollars for butlers pint is fine by me! The food here is average pub grub but it's more a place you go for the atmosphere and music ! Service is fast and friendly, and there is a lot of selection of seating. Definitely a fave spot in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"A little better than your standard Firkin if only for the service! Super friendly wait staff, fast and helpful and courteous and friendly! (wait, I said friendly twice). 

Granted it's still a chain but when all I'm looking for is a beer with some friends, the rest doesn't matter much. Service is ten times better than O'Grady's across the street and the prices are similar, as far as I've noticed. 

It's become a standard spot for a beer before hitting another bar in the Gayberhood. I'll keep going back.

TIP: They're typically quite happy to accommodate larger groups when they can which makes it different from a lot of other pubs in the village.

ETA: If you don't like gays or \"bums\", don't go to the village and definitely don't sit on the patio! Someone messaged me so they could tell me this is the worst Firkin they've ever been to because of the gays and the bums. Seriously, people? Oh, and let's get real, if you don't like gays, I'd rather you didn't come to Toronto at all. Please and thanks."}
{"text":"As a regular business visitor to Toronto it's hard often to find somewhere where you are welcomed as much as the locals. But this place is an exception. Everytime I visited I was welcomed and interacted with both at bar and outside by staff and food was always great and well priced. Drinks have a great strength which as you may know in canada is something ay!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a bite before a show at the Pheonix. I had the curry ($11.95), which was served with a small salad and naan bread. The curry was tomato-based, which is not my favourite, but none-the-less was pretty good. The naan bread was plentiful and fresh, though not as fatty as your usual Indian naan. Overall a pretty good meal, especially for the low price point. The main floor has a bar, and to get to the restaurant portion you have to go up the stairs at the back which was a little confusing."}
{"text":"my friend and i went for dinner 2 weeks ago and i'm sad to report they have increased the prices on the menu.. too much i believe!! my favourite pot roast dinner is now $17.. for a pub i think that is overpriced! 

so i had the app version called 'stuffed yorkie' for $8 and it was the pot roast chopped up with the yorkshire pudding stuffed with the potato mash and gravy.. so basically minus the veggies and you save $9! but it was crazy salty!!!! i told the server and they were like: ok i'll tell the kitchen. no offer of a complimentary dessert to make up for it since he never came to check on us while i was eating and i was starving so i ate it! 

so we have decided to not to go there as often. we'll go back for some things on the menu that didn't get jacked up price wise!!"}
{"text":"This place is probably the best pub food in the Village. It is easily a step above the adjacent Ogradys. I've been here several times, and the food is consistently good, and it's priced very reasonably. 

I love how a lot of the dishes come with fries AND onion rings, and if you want to substitute for salad there's no charge (I always get frustrated when they charge you an extra couple bucks for salad!). I've had burgers, salads, wraps, and sandwiches here, and I've always been pleasantly surprised. The staff are VERY friendly as well, so it makes for a good experience.

Finally, Churchmouse has THE BEST NACHOS! I honestly never really liked nachos until I tried theirs. The chips are delicious and the platter is packed with all kinds of yummy stuff. Thank you, Churchmouse, for making me like nachos!"}
{"text":"So very standard of a Firkin.  But I love firkin's because they are consistenly good.
I would rather, however cross over across the street and find myself at the o'grady's pub."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and great drink specials. Wings are okay.

We came in on a Friday evening and it was pretty packed. The drink specials of the day were $5 tall boys of Millstreet Organic and $4 shots of jagermeister. So it was that kind of night. 

Our server was super friendly and great, even offering to find my friend some Tums when something disagreed with him (I blame his lame stomach. We ate/drank the same thing and I was fine.)

The wings were pretty good, but the suicide sauce was more like hot. They were salty. The BBQ flavour was better. Fries were fine and the one plate was enough for two people to snack on casually.

A few friends joined us after and we settled into a booth, which was nice and comfy. Oh and I had to leave early, and the server got me my bill, which had half of the wing order on it. I didn't even know that was possible!! 

I'd probably come back when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"One of the closest pubs to my home, it's a reliable favorite when in need of a drink or some food.

Like: Staff is always super friendly and chatty - they feel like friends.  Menu is varied, reasonably priced and has good quality options.  Prices are great, especially the daily drinks specials which can be as low $5 for a pint or glass of wine.  They recently renovated and it looks nicer than ever.

Dislike: Not a whole lot.  This is a place that is consistently a good option.  Can be fairly busy, especially on the patio in nice weather.

Definitely a place I'd go back to over and over - especially the patio.  After numerous visits, I've rarely had anything bad to say."}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place is the patio.  The food is plan, over priced and the service is slow and unfriendly.  Been there a bunch of times, and always the same.   Staff need to learn to smile and multi-task.  Some staff are good but most not so good."}
{"text":"Pro : really like the Ambiance specialy at the second floor or the Patio. Burger are nice and good beers as well. Belgium Moon is great.

Also always had a good service as well."}
{"text":"An okay place to go for lunch on a warm weekday/weekend afternoon, Churchmouse and Firkin is a Village hotspot for those wanting to see and be seen. With indoor and outdoor seating, the place is very happening during summer months when people watching is an enjoyed sport. Menu here is okay, servings are large, and service is average. Would come again if going with a friend(s), otherwise I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We were here last night. We ordered the hummus platter. I loved the red onions with arugula. I want to figure out how they made the red onions!! The hummus was so good. Leaps better than any hummus I ever made. I would love to talk to their chefs about how they made this. The pita chips also good. Nice to have a lighter option for an appetizer. 
Service started to get slow around 9. We had to ask twice for a few things, but that's okay. I'd still return. I had a great time!!"}
{"text":"Having visited the 'not so renovated' Churchmouse a year and a half ago, I wasn't too impressed.  Average food, below average decor, and carpets that belonged in a museum. 

My hockey team started going here after the renovations, and they did an AMAZING job!  The menu is great, the portions just right, and the staff are truly welcoming.  The new patio is a great addition, I only wish it were able to get a bit more sun. 

One of the only places where I can say that I'm not too upset when they're busy, as I'm just happy they're doing so well.  The servers make this place, and it seems like most of them stay long term - for sure a good sign."}
{"text":"Not a bad little spot to take a date in the gay Village or get revved up before going out to a show. The apps are a little expensive but they're higher-quality and if they're not to your liking they will try to remove it from the bill or throw you a free drink which is super cool"}
{"text":"One of the best Bloody Caesar I've had. And they have a fried calamari caesar salad that is on some secret menu... Good portion size with lots of calamari. Was Yummy."}
{"text":"The food is.....ok. It's bar food that tastes like it was made a week ago and heated in a microwave. The mixed drinks are pretty watered down so if you want a good drink stick to the beer"}
{"text":"A MUST GO IN THE VILLAGE!

My husband and I have ate at this restaurant countless times! When we are walking around TO thinking of what to eat, we sometimes just default to here. 

The food is always good, but really depends on the chef at the time. I've had some gross fish and chips, but majority of the time it's great. I'd recommend to look at the feature or special of the day since it's most likely the freshest option. 

The service is just amazing here! We've been lucky to get the same guy every time. If you get served by the red head with the dachshund tattoo then please note you're going to have AMAZING service. I wish I knew his name to give him a huge shout out, but we honestly love this guy. 

Overall, I'll be back and I continue to bring my friends & family to this location."}
{"text":"Great place!  Clearly very popular.  If we'd gotten there any later, I doubt we'd have found a seat.  It seems to be like this every day of the week!

The food was terrific!  Fried pickles are nom... :-)  The service is as prompt as can be expected, what with how busy it gets (as previously stated).

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is they didn't appear to have potato skins (a classic pub fare), no dart board, and they didn't have much in the way of UK import beers such as Hobgoblin from the Wychwood Brewery.  These items just seem to be something you expect as \"the norm\" in Firkin pubs.  :-/

Otherwise, we'll definitely be going back.  If you have the chance, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is good. Service is good. Servers and bar tenders are up beat and friendly. The food however isn't fantastic, not horrible either. It really depends what you get."}
{"text":"Restaurants in the village divide into basically two categories: low-quality, intermediate priced pubs or higher-quality, high-price restaurants.  The Churchmouse & Firkin is in the former category, but I'm happy to say it's near the top of it.

First to note, the Churchmouse is a part of the giant Firkin pub chain in the \"New Britania Style\" (when you read that sentence, you should make sure to either pronounce the quotation marks as 'quote' or make physical air quotes with your hands).  As such, it's pretty standard pub FOOD  You can expect consistently average pub food at these places.  You will never be wowed, but hopefully you won't be too disappointed.  I've found the shepherd's pie to be perfectly decent and the burger to be over-cooked and dry.  I will say the quality of the food exceeds that of both O'Grady's (which I doubt anyone will argue with) and Hair of the Dog (which some may want to debate with me).  

The DRINKS are pretty standard pub drinks.  On the tap list you get the macros like Rickard's and Canadian as well as some of the macro-micro's like Steamwhistle.  A pint is $7.70 with tax, which is sadly pretty standard prices on the street for quite pedestrian beers.  They do make an effort with their Caesar's.  Cocktails are low-quantity as is standard, but I do like that they have Pimm's in summer, although with a mere 1.5oz of the low-alcohol liquor.  Wines are expensive and bad...give them a miss for sure.

The SERVICE here is generally pretty good.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The patio can be a bit hit and miss, but I've always felt some genuine friendliness from the staff.  

OVERALL, if your plan is a pub-type restaurant on Church Street, this is your correct choice.  It's so much better than O'Grady's, I can't fathom why anyone goes across the street, except for their giant patio in summer."}
{"text":"Had an awful experience at this restaurant. I lost my wallet and realised it only when I got home. I called the restaurant and told the manager exactly where I was seated. Their response:\" you can call back later or you come back here to look yourself!\" So when I got back to the restaurant, I saw the wallet lying under my chair. It didn't take me more than one second. I had a word with the manager to express my disappointment that the waiter didn't try to look for my wallet. It is not their responsibility but certainly would be an act of good customer service and kindness. Instead the manager said \"it's our company policy to not look. I'm sorry. And we are done\", with hands pointing at the door asking me to leave!"}
{"text":"It was a beautiful sunny day during the festival, we decided to have lunch at the Church Mouse patio.  I understand during this weekend, the wait staff is very busy but ignoring the patrons is not acceptable.  We tried to get some shade under the patio but they refused to bring out the canopy.  They gave us several excuses why they couldnt bring out the canopy.  Wind/Rain on the radar and due to the sun, the heat gets trapped under the canopy.  It wasnt a pleasant lunch experience as I was very uncomfortable.  Other guests were also complaining about the sun on the patio but their requests were ignored.  Definitely not a place to come and enjoy during the day."}
{"text":"Friendly people and good beer but very limited weekend brunch menu with few specials. Lots of other vastly better brunch places in the city."}
{"text":"They are perfect in service and the food.extremely friendly and they ask for all of the your food detail.I'm sure they are 100000000time's beter than ogradys.I was ordered beef and chips and she told me I have another option for have the salad instead of chips.it was perfectttttttttt"}
{"text":"This is a reliable choice to meet friends, make news ones or watch the game.     Great service and menu."}
{"text":"How do I count thee ways to thank yee , you sheltered me from the rain and provide me with Bloody Ceasars..

Pride Toronto, rained before the Parade and after the Parade.  Good news was that I was able to enjoy it dry because of friend of friends and your friendly neighborhood chain bar.  Apparently all owned by a chain, other names are Fox and Firkin, etc.  Name your animal and Firkin.

Atmosphere coy, drinks not too strong, cost okay.  However it did provide shelter when torrents of tears from heaven fell on the street and the fair goers."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It is perfect for people watching, hanging with friends, or as a date-night stop-in.  The food is pretty good, and the staff seems to be friendly.  I have been here three times now and have not had a bad experience yet."}
{"text":"The hostess was a very very friendly girl who put a giant smile on my face. Never saw a hostess so happy in my life. 

They have handsome waiters, that's true. I asked for one drink or two, they weren't as good as I expected. Then I decided to ask for an Oreo Brownie and a Coffee, to indulge my sweet tooth, and said something about being drunk. 

The waiter brought me the bill and said he couldn't serve me anything else because I was drunk. Eh? I decided to pay and go to the pub next door. 

I understand his concern about drunk customers. If you care so much about me, buy an ethilometer and ask me to blow it, something like that. Banning me from your place is too rude for me. I didn't like it."}
{"text":"I like this place as it's right across from where I live.  The atmosphere is great, but the two levels are not always open.  The staff are amazing and fun, but can be a bit flaky at times.

Best Nachos in the village - add the chicken!  They are expensive though - $19....but it's filling and YUMMY.

In true Firkin fashion - it's great in a pinch and I would take it over any other pub in the area."}
{"text":"Went here with my aunt to grab a drink and a bite to eat after arriving in Toronto from NYC. It was around 6 on a Friday night, so the place was pretty packed. Thankfully I was able to find a seat at one of the tables across from the bar.

After ordering a pint of Strongbow, I noticed that they had daily food special. I was a bit hungry and can never resist lamb curry, so I decided to order the Friday small curry daily special.

For $9, the \"small\" plate of lamb curry is loaded up with lamb, rice, yogurt sauce, apple chutney, and naan. I was just looking for a little snack, but this was a full blown meal!

The lamb was very tender and the curry had just the right amount of spice to add flavor, but not kill your palette. The rice was what you would expect and the yogurt and chutney were a nice addition to the flavor profile. Lastly, the naan was some of the best I've ever had--it had great seasoning and little toastiness to it--and was a decent sized portion.

Overall, I was not expecting much from this corner pub, but was pleasantly surprised with not only the low prices, but the high food quality as well. In addition, the wait staff was super friendly and the atmosphere was great. Definitely worth checking out, especially if you love curry."}
{"text":"After Gord and I toured the Loblaws at Maple Leaf Gardens, we walked to the Churchmouse & Firkin for supper.

It was a busy spot and we managed to grab a table by the window.

Mark was our server and he took really good care of us. He was funny and friendly. He seemed to know everyone and obviously loves his job.

Gord ordered Pad Thai (rice noodles, chicken, egg, green onions and bean sprouts all tossed in our tangy pad thai sauce). It was tasty.

I was going to order wings but Mark talked me into ordering one of the specials, Meat Lasagna and Garlic Bread. It was good too (thanks, Mark!).

We had a fun time and will definitely popped back in the next time we are in that 'hood."}
{"text":"2 floor neighbourhood pub with exceptional service and great pub food and industry standard drink prices that include a daily $5 pint selection.  They're on Twitter too @ChurchmouseFrkn.

Always a great time every visit."}
{"text":"Waited to get a table for 2, but didn't make any sense since there was tables available but they would only sit a party of 4. I mean, you rather make people wait just in case 4 people show up?! Bad management."}
{"text":"Came in with my lady friends and got raped on 2 beers and 2 weak a*s mixed drinks that were supposed to be \"doubles.\" - double the juice- - then got a bill for $45!!!! I tipped 20% because I was raised with manners, and the chubby- fat bearded bitchy boy behind the bar proceeded to talk crap to us being not from here- if you are American, don't give this place your business- there are plenty of other bars on this street that will appreciate your patronage- if you believe people should be shamed when trying to pay money for service or drinks DO NOT Give this bar your money- no one spending money should be treated bad- they hate Americans-"}
{"text":"Believe what you read. Very tasty! Stopped by with mom around 3:30PM Tuesday. Sat inside with Eric as our server (name on the receipt). He was fantastic - great personality. Ordered the fried pickles. Now, I consider myself a connoisseur on these babies and these are some of the best that I have ever had (Texas and South Carolina included). They are spear shaped (not my fav) but the pickle was kosher dill with a great bite - not too wet, or salty - perfect. Coating was wonderful.  Love.   Mom ordered the Shepherd Pie - she ranked it has one of the 2 best ever. I had the Butter Chicken (never heard of it before) but I loved it. Chicken in an tomato based, Indian spiced sauce served with tandoori mash potatoes and a yougurt/dill cream drizzle. The naan was hot and delicious. This place is solid, clean, airy, just perfect for a wonderful lunch,   Great service.  Two entrees, one appetizer and bill ran $39.00"}
{"text":"Food is quite good. I like the service. Specials are very reasonable. The second floor has an amazing view. i strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Really good service! The waiter was very friendly and nice and he even let me and my friend stay after they closed the pub after seeing that my friend and I were engrossed in an intense conversation lol"}
{"text":"The food is good, but could be better. The best thing about this place is definitely the patio. It's recently renovated and looks great both inside and out. Drinks are good, but could be colder. Service is very good and it's a great location. Would give it a higher rating if the food was better. Perfect spot for people watching on a weekend afternoon."}
{"text":"This was the first of the Firkin pubs I ever tried (new in town), so I don't know how the menu selections compare to the other Firkins (based on some of the other reviews, it's not hugely different). I can't talk to that point.

But: I can talk to how the food is cooked, and the service. The fact that I give it five stars says it all - I'm not the slightest bit hesitant to give something one star if I don't think it deserves more than that, and as an event planner who has worked with many caterers, I don't impress easily when it comes to food.

Friend visiting from out of town and I hit this place on a hot, humid, typically-Summer evening. We collapsed into our seats and ordered the biggest, coldest glasses of water they had, and spent the next five minutes fanning ourselves with the menus before actually looking at them. The waitress was a hoot - very kind, very funny, and very helpful. Double dose of the latter two, actually.

We couldn't decide between various starters and items on the full menu, and on the advice of said helpful waitress, decided to go with just a selection of starters. 

We had the Mushroom and Brie Flatbread, which was absolutely to die for and I made note to try and attempt to recreate it at home (only the second or third time I've ever encountered something on a menu that I was so taken with as to want to try, since I'm NOT a cook and rarely bother). I had it some time later at a different Firkin and found it bland and tasteless - maybe Churchmouse and Firkin just prepares it better?

We also had the Cheddar and Ale Crock, and we almost licked out the crock when it was all done. Lastly, the Sweet Potato Fries. I'm not a huge fan of those, because in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I came from, they're very common on menus, but they did a nice job with them.

I wish I could remember what we ordered for dessert. I remember it was sinful, and that we'd ordered it on the advice, again, of our waitress. We were intrigued when we saw it go by on her tray, on the way to another table. Mostly we were intrigued by the fact that she held it low when walking by a rowdy group of eight across from us, too low to be seen by any of them. 

When we asked about it, she said the item was a pain in the butt (not her exact words :)) to prepare and that she didn't want to encourage them to order eight of it. We asked if it was worth it. She said yes. We asked if she'd hate us if we ordered one to share. She said no. So we did. Whatever it was - chocolate and molten, if I recall aright - was wonderful. 

Any restaurant, even if it's a pub with pub fare, where the service is speedy and friendly, the food delectable, the prices reasonable, gets five stars from me."}
{"text":"3 of us popped in on a Thursday afternoon for a late lunch (2:30pm). We were seated immediately and provided with menus. A few minutes later our server came by and asked if we wanted to order drinks. He took our drink order and they were out in less than 5 minutes.
The server was friendly and apologized for not coming over sooner (as soon as we arrived) as he was busy taking food out to other patrons. There was no need to apologize as he was there within a reasonable time frame....plus he was friendly and had a great personality.

Menu is typical pub fare with some interesting items on it.

I ordered the Chicken Gumbo and a Caesar salad. 1 dining companion ordered the grilled parmesan cheese sandwich (came with fries and a deep fried pickle). The 3rd person ordered a maple glazed chicken salad. Our server asked if I wanted the gumbo with my meal or as an appetizer, I opted to have it as an appetizer and it was out within 5 minutes.

My gumbo was not really gumbo...although it contained some of the ingredients gumbo has (okra, tomatoes, rice, etc). It was far too watery to be called gumbo (it was along the lines of a watered down tomato soup)....plus it contained maybe 2 shirt button sized pieces of chicken and no andouille sausage.. it was a disappointment as I LOVE gumbo and it would have been perfect on a cold winters day. My salad was ok....a bit under dressed with a pretty bland Caesar salad dressing. No lemon wedge, no parmesan cheese offered.
The dining companion who had the grilled cheese sandwich loved it. He said it was excellent and the deep fried pickle was an added bonus. Fries were typical pub fare.
Our other friend enjoyed his grilled chicken salad (it was sliced breast of chicken on what appeared to be spinach but could have been organic lettuce). He said the maple glaze on it was excellent.

All in all, the food was ok...very pub style food. Service very good. Warm environment.

I would have rated it 3 1/2 stars but 1/2 star ratings are not possible. I the gumbo wasn't a let down the review would have been 4 stars.

I will revisit if in the area to try other items."}
{"text":"The Churchmouse just reopened after a renovation and it looks great.  Fantastic new modern look, really comfy chairs, same great service and food.  Love this place, I'll be back more often."}
{"text":"Ate there tonight (June 25, 2015).  Food was average but service was horrible.  Waitress walked by like we were invisible.  Bartender was too busy socializing to serve drinks.  Spent close to $100 and they wanted $2 for a slice of bread to eat with a sausage.  First time ever that I did not leave a tip.  There are too many other good restaurants with staff that care to eat where it appears they don't want your businesses, just your cash.  Never again."}
