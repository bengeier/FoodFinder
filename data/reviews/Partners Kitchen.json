They have a two piece special for $5.79 that comes with ,two pieces of chicken a side and a drink...(fries which are like the ones from Costco ...coleslaw, macaroni or onion rings) ..student special is the same for $5 bit you only get fries"}
{"text":"I don't know where this place came from but I got a flyer in the mail and went to check it out and see what they served so they explained to me as soon as I entered the place it was newly renovated an had about 30 seats inside and looks very inviting I also checked the washrooms and it is up to Par. The menu consist of fry chicken  fried rice and chowmein. So I ordered the three piece combo that came with a side and a drink  about 6 to 7 dollars,, boy, was I surprised when I took a bite.  Simply amazing.  Will be my local joint!   Only con seems to be little parkin and was hard to find.  Not a bother for me as I walked."}
