{"text":"Second time ordering. First time our Burger s were burnt. Thought they were just busy and decided to give them a second chance a few months later. Once again the burgers were burnt, very burnt, almost cracked a tooth. Gravy tasted weird as if it was old. Will not go here again"}

I'd give these guys 100 stars if I could ."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Greek food in the city. I could eat their Greek salad all day long. They have the best Greek fries, and they heap on the feta.   When I was recovering from surgery and bed ridden their delivery driver was incredibly accommodating. They are always so nice and so quick. I really can't say enough good things."}
{"text":"One of the best places ever not just cus of the price but the awesome an friendly ppl aswell"}
{"text":"Love this place so much, grew up eating here too. They have amazing food at wonderful prices. Also delivery is a decent time wait too about 30 min!"}
{"text":"Decent food but doesn't take authentically Greek to me. Their fish in the fish and chips meal doesn't have much taste but everything else I've tasted is pretty good. They also do delivery which is a huge plus."}
{"text":"Had the chicken souvlaki on a bun+onion rings and it was pretty good, definitely a spot I'd come back to when I want some quick greek food"}
{"text":"The person working there is very rude. She never said good morning or anything. Then I asked for what she recommends for breakfast and her answer was to look at the vreakfast menu. She s obviusly not in a good mood to work today, and this is definitly an experience I wont repeat."}
{"text":"Great bang for buck you get your money's worth. Delivery is always very fast. And food isn't dissapoibting happy customer, we always go with the chicken souvlaky dinners and it's great"}
