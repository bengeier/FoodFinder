{"text":"Bomb wings.  Great service.  Great prices.  Need to upgrade the tv's.  Feels like happy hour every hour.  Great hole in the wall feel and people are extremely friendly.  Staff remembers you from your first visit on."}
{"text":"My parents started coming here 25 years ago on a \"bicycle tour\" through all the different bars in the Valley.  Stacker's was on one of their stops.    Back when I was in high school, my dad decided that we should revisited Stacker's.  My parents haven't stopped going since.   The cheapest drinks in town during happy hour!  And the wings are the best we have ever had anywhere.  You can't beat the dinner prices...or lunch for that matter!!  Can't beat that!!!    Yes, the décor hasn't changed since it first opened.  However, if you're the type who only cares about atmosphere, and you want to pay high prices and eat low quality food, then Stacker's isn't the place for you anyway...  It's been about 10 years since I've graduated high school, and my husband loves Stacker's.  Unfortunately, we no longer live in state, but we ALWAYS make an effort to swing by Stacker's when we are in town for a visit.  LOVE this place!!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I have to add another!! Seriously mic medium sauce with bourbon molasses wings here and your life will change.!!! Game days are the absolute best I can't handle it!! If you haven't been here you're missing out on serious customer service quality"}
{"text":"The wings are awesome, I'll give them that.  But it's in a bad location and reminds you that bar in movies where something is about to go down.  My advice, get the wings to go and get out while the getting is good."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken wings!!!  It's all I eat from this joint...  They are not breaded (naked) and definitely meaty!!  I'm there once a week. Neighborhood dive bar with amazing wings!!"}
{"text":"Place was crazy busy when I got there. Bartender Shelley, who was also the cashier for the two servers on duty was killing it behind the bar. She was so busy but somehow managed to smile and give everyone the attention they needed. I didn't eat here so I have nothing to say about the food.  There were a lot of regulars and I was an outsider, but felt welcome. It's not a fancy bar but they have 15 taps. If you're in the area for Spring Training or whatever, come see Shelley."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar. Best hot wings in town. New happy hour times 2:30 thur 7:00 Monday through Saturday. Wings are 50 cents each with beverage purchase during happy hour. $2 pints and bottles of bud or Bud light. Domestic pitchers $3.25/5.25.  Odell IPA,  Kilt Lifter,  Blue Moon on draft."}
{"text":"Been going there for close to 30 years.. it's Timeless  great bar and Sara is the best bartender I've ever seen... anybody gets close they deserve to treat themselves to a real bar atmosphere great place... the food is fantastic and the cook is a great guy great sense of humor"}
{"text":"Stackers has the best wings that I have ever had........great Bloody Marys! Love this place!"}
{"text":"We are not from Phoenix but fell in love with this dive bar and their cheap beer and food and very friendly staff. Came to visit this place each night during our stay in Phoenix."}
{"text":"If I could put 4.5 I would. Nobody is perfect. True Biker bar but the food is amazing. If I was coming back to Phoenix it would be on my list to come back again. Staff makes you feel like you are family... 80's meet 2016..."}
{"text":"Perfect bar! Great wings, cheap beer, good service and friendly people. Would recommend this place to anyone in the area. Only complaint is limited beer selection but can't expect it at this type of place. Can't say enough about the quality of the wings. Cooked to perfection and great spice. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp after our soccer game was canceled decided to try it out for lunch. Wings were awesome! Cooked all the way with lots of sauce and great flavor. I had the chicken Philly and it was delicious! I recommend this to anyone looking for good food at great prices. Locals were friendly :)"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years with the family!  Their wings are always bomb and the atmosphere is chill. The staff knows the normal customers and know how to make them feel welcomed.  Last time we went we were told they were out of batter so the server suggested to not order anything deep fried with better like fried pickles. We appreciated her opinion but ordered anyway and they didn't taste so bad. But it was kind of her to be real about it. Only reason it's not a 5 star because the music kind of sucks. You have to pay to hear music. Which is smart for them but sucks for us. It's a Jukebox $1.00 for two songs I believe.  Also, because the food is so bomb it is sort of a family restaurant (despite being a bar) and they don't offer high chairs. Which is understandable but it would have been amazing to have my 2 year old in a high chair!"}
{"text":"If I could describe Stackers in one word it would be \"classic\". It reminds me of that old show Cheers because literally everyone knows everyones name.   The beers cheap, the foods decent enough (which means its awesome when your slightly wasted) and the environments relaxed.... what else could you ask for in a bar??  Oh and yea, those 50 cent wings are some of the best in Phoenix,  try them!"}
{"text":"Hi, Ive been a loyal customer since it was first opened over 30 yrs ago, I WILL NOT buy wings anywhere else, they are the best in town!  the food, staff and people are the best also, such a comfortable, kid friendly bar\restaurant.  Give them a try, you'll fall in love with the staff!"}
{"text":"If you like a dive bar with good food and friendly staff and patrons, I believe you have found your bar. Happy Hour 3:30p-8p. (Yeah, you read that right. A recent change. )Fifty cent wings-YUUUUUUUUUMMM! We went on a Wednesday, February 18th about 6p. It's a really small place, but it was pretty full. They had a bartender, cook and one waitress working the floor. And that waitress was FAST and friendly. The only thing I didn't like, I wish they had a a larger bar area. My husband and I always prefer to hang at the bar at dive bars so we can get to know the regulars and make new friends. Can't do that in a booth. Going to be praying a new space opens up so that this little place can expand. After years of being loyal patrons at Wagon Yard, new owners are pushing the old timers out the door and taking the once successful bar \"in a new direction.\" Good luck with that. Knew the breakfast cook here ;) and decided to give it a shot.  Yes, it was worth it! See you soon, Stackers!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Stackers for over 3 years now, since I am in walking distance and enjoy the ability to crawl home after too many drinks. A month ago I would have given this super-friendly, laid back neighborhood dive 4 stars, but a recent hike in their prices forces my hand at 3.   Pros: stiff drinks, great staff, friendly bar folk, cheap booze, pool table and a decent juke box  Cons: just so-so bar food that seems to all taste kinda the same....weird  The proximity to my home, cheap booze and free drink at 5 on Friday will keep me coming back for more. If you want to stop by, get there before happy hour because this place gets packed every day and finding a seat can take some time."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great staff. I come here often with my fiancé, family, and friends and we always have a good time. Wings are the best in town!"}
{"text":"Oh ya. Just moved to place nearby and my first visit in highly impressed.  The fish is delicious and the price is right.  Great group of people there. My new favorite fish fry joint"}
{"text":"Stopped by because it was in close proximity to where we needed to be that afternoon. Noticed it had decent reviews. For a \"hole in the wall\" the place is good. I though the staff was very friendly and we felt welcome right away. Food was good, though it took awhile to get given that they were not that busy. But thats ok, the company was good so it didn't really bother us."}
{"text":"Five stars! This food is amazing! I'm not much of an alcoholic drinker but I've gone here many times simply for the food. ! \"It's like an orgasm in my mouth!\"  Great prices and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Husband went to get us some food to go from here last night. Burgers were tasty, our steak fries were overcooked and had no salt or seasoning on them. Zucchini rounds were tempura fried and just ok. We also had an order of boneless wings and those were pretty good."}
{"text":"I came to eat at this restaurant last night I was ordering to go. I am white my friend is black. I felt the were really racist. They gave us the cold shoulder and the server was extremely rude. She rushed me to order. My food sat on the counter for  ten minutes before they gave it to me.  The owner was there as well and when issue was brought to him all he cared about  was that I paid for it. He was worse than the server. Told me im not allowed there anymore cause I complained.  This is by far the wort servers customer service I have ever experienced.  Rude people, food was good but its npt worth being treated with such disrespect. I wouldnt recommend this resturaunt even if it was the lake last one standing. Horrible,  horrible people."}
{"text":"This has been hands down the place to go for hot wings! Always order them extra crispy, finger licking good! Also, I've never had a bad experience here whether its the staff or customers."}
{"text":"Horrid smell when walked in so we walked right out!  Between the odor and scene, it appeared very unclean. We went here because it was close to our hotel and somehow had a 4 star average review on Yelp. Do not make the same mistake as us! Jon Taffer would not be happy with this joint!"}
{"text":"It was ok until I hear the owner cussing at a pregnant waitress and the bartender . I have never seen such a display of hatred, i do not recommend this place. The owner is less than deserving of anyone's business."}
{"text":"Best happy hour wings in town!!! My first time here I felt like I didn't belong just cause it gave me the impression of a biker-ish dive bar. Needless to say the yummy wings, chill waitresses and laid back environment have me coming back. Booths are kinda uncomfortable but who cares!"}
{"text":"Came here with a coworker tonight to have a beer and to celebrate me getting accepted to ASU. It's a nice little dive bar which I've never been to before but there's a first for everything!  We sat ourselves and a waitress came to us right away. We got a pitcher of beer and she brought it out with ice cold glasses. I got their six piece wings and it took a while to come but it was amazingly delicious. I've heard many great things about their wings and now I know why! They weren't those pathetic wings that are super crispy and no chicken in them. They were \"beefy\" (for lack of a better word) and so tender. I can consider myself a fan.  It was a nice little place to hang out, have a beer, and chow down on some wings. Will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar of all time. I've been coming here so long I remember smoking inside. They have great American bar food and cheap drinks. Their wings are great but, so are their burger and Ruben.   It's a dive bar and nothing fancy but,  they do what they do well. Great staff as well."}
{"text":"Just what my buds and I were looking for, so we thought.   A local style bar that's close to home has decent bar food and our favorite beer on tap.  First visit and impression was an OK atmosphere, typical bar food menu but not so cold beer :(   We all agreed that the chicken wings are excellent.   The bar is dark wood and uncomfortable booths, the staff is friendly sometimes. The EVERYDAY barflies' tend to cheapen the place, maybe it is them that wear on the staff causing their lack of enthusiasm.  Still I was compelled to return mainly because the tasty chicken wings and the proximity to home.   Now here it comes at least 7 out of 10 visits our tab reflected drinks that we did not order! Hmmm, so I always asked the wait staff or bartender why? They were quick with their replies, their apologies and offers to fix it. OK that's great but on my last visit they tried to charge us for a pitcher of beer we did not order or consume, the first 2 that we did drink were at a different price, go figure. The tax on the liquor was nonexistent WOW! I am starting to believe that this was being done intentionally.   Shame on me for returning, but sometimes you want to believe that it was truly an accident or anything but intentionally being ripped off or taken advantage of.  Enough is enough; lame unacceptable excuses and the repeat offenses have left me and my friends angry. My friends and I are done with Stackers and will never return.   Fair warning; keep track of your bill if you plan to visit Stackers.   I give them 2 stars only because of the chicken wings!  I do hope that the owner and staff will read this and take it to heart."}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal. We're talking FAT zucchini slices hand battered and fried to perfection, delicious wings that are priced darn near cost, and a perfectly cooked burger that rivals the current burger bar trend.  It's a dive and it's near the interstate so the area is a little sketchy. You may see tweakers nearby, but don't worry all the people in the bar are chill. Don't expect anything fancy, just amazing food and cheap beer. Great value for sure.   We own a restaurant, so we end up having to eat out well after closing, so we eat a lot of bar food (when not eating pizza). This is the best of the best for classic bar fare."}
{"text":"Imagine you open a sports bar in 1980 and then don't change anything to 'keep up with the times.' 35 years later, they still have the same decor, they still serve many food items that other restaurants have long since stopped offering (potato skins come to mind) and it seems the only thing they've 'upgraded' are the prices (to keep up with costs) and added about 18 flat screen TVs. Other than that, it hasn't really changed. This is a biker bar, and when I was there, the crowd was made up mostly of older people, many of whom look like they were once (or still are) bikers.  This isn't a problem. Bikers are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet. Our waitress treated us like we were regulars and everything we ordered was good. Prices were fair and the food did not take long from ordering to serving. The bench seats used in the dining booths are very narrow. You get about 10 inches of seat for your bottom. That's it. So apart from feeling like I was sitting a booth designed for children, I really liked this place.  They also do this weird thing with the music that I also like. A song will come on and, when its over, its stays quiet for about 5 minutes before the next song plays. I like this because it can be hard to have a conversation at restaurants that have music constantly blaring. This music gave diners a break of silence between songs. I like this a lot and wish more places would exercise this practice. Its not a club, it's a restaurant!  I've read numerous stories about how rude the owner can be on display to his customers, though we did not experience any of that. Our entire dining experience was 'normal.'  This place is a bit of a dive, but its actually quite nice for a 35 year old biker bar. No issues with parking or finding the place. They also have a lot of menu items I want to try, from the burgers to the wings. I had the Philly steak sandwich and loved it.   Looking forward to dining here again real soon and enjoying my trip back to 80s when I'm there. Love it!  UPDATE:  Went back last night after reading the reviews here about how great the hot wings are. I ordered 6 mild wings, 6 medium wings and 6 hot wings. They were just .55 per wing and domestic beer was $2. Pretty cheap!  The wings do take a while to cook, but the wait is worth it. The mild has no heat at all, the mediums have a slight heat and the hot flavored wings have a medium heat to them. I didn't care for the smell of the hot sauce on the hot-flavored wings. I think I would order mediums in the future (and ask to make them crispy!)  The salads here that I've tried are also excellent!"}
{"text":"Well let's begin with the 25 cent charge for extra ranch when all they give you is a 2 ounce portion with 12 wings.  Then while you're dining you get to enjoy the owner Lou, yelling at and belittling his staff. Would have enjoyed myself but I hate owners who treat their staff terribly"}
{"text":"I have been going here several times a month with friends and the food has always been yummy. But the last several times have been not so good. I usually order the grilled chicken salad and it is very good. This time the chicken was cold and dry I think they went out of their way to add water to the salad (very watery) the bell pepper was rotten or something, and the hard boiled egg looked bad. On the plus side the ranch was great as always. And everything seems to be way over cooked. Service is always good and so are the drinks. They have the best cheese curds and that is one of the main reasons we go but they have been out of them quite frequently lately so we must not be the only ones that like them.  I hope they start improving soon I don't want to find another dive bar. Another con is that the seats are pretty uncomfortable to me. If you go on Friday make sure to place reservations as the place fills up quick."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years. The atmosphere is awesome,  staff is extremely friendly and the food is good.  Stackers is best known for their wings and phillys.  Prices are average but if you order a philly better have help,  they are huge.  The stackers burger is also very big. Wings are cooked to order and many sauces tho choose from.  I seen someone put that stackers is a total biker bar but that is not true.  They have all kinds of people coming here.  Most of the employees have been there for over 15 yrs and will treat you like family.  My family and I love going there.  Come give it a try."}
{"text":"Wings were great. Had the Southwestern Melt sandwich, it hit the spot. Service was great. Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"I just have to say again this place has the best wings in town Nobody gets them as crispy as they do. The sauce is your average wing sauce, its good not fancy with mild,. med, and hot but its not about the sauce its about the wing. I never dip my wings in ranch or blue cheese. The ranch is for the carrots or celery in my opinion.  God dam I find myself craving them at least once a week. The other thing I like here is the Chicken Philly. Freakin awesome. This place also has the cheapest beer ever. Love this place. The wait staff here are great and very friendly. Its funny cause I have been going here a while and everyone working here loves me but there is one lady that works here that likes me but hates me cause everytime I go in there I play some heavy metal on the juke box. I play the music cause welI I love heavy metal but also because she cant stand it when I play it. I get all the other waitresess to sing with me and she gets so upset and just rolls her eyes. I love it! lol"}
{"text":"The thing to make stackers so great is the service --the ladies that work there work very hard, very fast, and they're always always friendly. also  their beer specials are great , they carry an okay House wine, they're always nice no matter how busy they are they're completely about serving the customer. I've never had a bad meal or bad service at stackers and you can come exactly as you are. One wish is that they would carry some local draft beers but that's the only thing I would improve upon. Update!!! They just got a fantastic IPAdraught beer!! Woo hoo"}
{"text":"Great place with great attitude! They will treat you like your a regular, and the red headed server named Sarah is awesome! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped to get gas on my way to Texas from my hometown of Vegas and felt a bit hungry and a little thirsty. Hit up yelp for a close bar and here I am. 2 things got my attention on Yelp. DIVE BAR and good WINGS! Absolutely my style! Bartender was very nice as she was pumping money into the jukebox, like a great bartender does. Already knew I wanted the wings but checked out the menu anyway. 5.99 for 6 wings! (.50 a piece during happy hour) Awesome! They also have great lunch specials for 5.75! Ordered mine Hot and crispy. Came out perfect. With veggies of course. Ordered a Goose IPA to wash it down with. Wasn't as cold as I would have liked it, but hey, it's a Dive Bar! If I lived near here I would be a regular!!! So glad I stopped in here! Well, I'd love to say more,but I have to hit the road! Thanks Shelly and Stackers!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. It looks a little run down and needs some maintenance however they have pretty good food and cheap beer so I'm game! :) we got wings, fries, beer and appetizers and everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! An friend named Donnell recommended Stackers for wings. Took home wings 3 times this week! They are the best! I tied garlic parm and garlic and red pepper sauce. They will mix and match any combination of flavors you would like. Terrific service. I am now a regular. Way to go Stackers"}
{"text":"Have not had wings in a very long time - you cannot come here and \"pass\" on the wings.  The whole neighborhood smells like their wings!  Definitely a divey dive bar with really good wings."}
{"text":"4 stars for service. But other than that, wings are definitely delicious. Went here with some friends and got some beer and wings around happy hour and mann were they good. We couldnt stop eating. We got both the bbq and mild wings. I would have to say that I prefer the potato wedges over the crinkle cut fries, but they were delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight with 2 family members and the food was GREAT! I had the fried shrimp dinner, (pic), and we shared the fried zucchini,  mushroom, onion rings combo. Made with FRESH veggies, ( not frozen). They had the French dip supreme with mushroom and swiss, and the tuna sandwich. We were all full and happy. I've been here before and the wings are made to order, any way you like and a bunch of sauce/ heat options to please any palate. The owner, Lou, even stopped by our table to see that we were happy. Great food, great service;  what more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Alright. This place has been sad the past few times i went. But this last time took the cake for me! There wasnt much people in the bar pretty mellow. Until one of the workers came out wasted and couldnt hold himself up! Our waitress Sarah kept serving him drinks when everyone at the bar was wanting her to stop so they could get this guy outta there.  He started a few fights at the pool table nearly tripping over himself on our table. Sarah our waitress just laughed and treaded on.. The food was terrible this time as the usual cook wasnt there.. Sarah \"forgot\" a lot of the things we ordered. Like a side of fries, bacon on a burger and ranch. We asked her many times only to her defense saying she never heard us say we wanted that, YET she wrote it on our ticket? huh? Then claimed the cook wasnt doing his job right and forgot our stuff not her. Haha... alright. If your going to lie make sure you do it right. It wasnt till we were done that we got our ranch, fries and bacon. What good is it now?  Oh and let me just add, i found a piece of hair wrapped around my wings. Nothing was done except for Sarah saying its not hers and walking away. DISGUSTING. Never again!"}
{"text":"Best wings ever, ,new flavors to choose from get them grilled you'll be amazed.  Been coming here for over 25 years."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad, but it's not great either. The food is mediocre and the atmosphere is your typical dive bar. Although, for some reason my Boyfriend loves it here. I think it has more to do with the fact that he's been coming here for years, so it has sentimental meaning to him or something. I will likely be back because he will make me come!"}
{"text":"4 stars based on previous visits, but I must tell you the story.  Came here a few months ago.... Swear I posted aNd then it wasn't there.. Anyways Always had a great time coming to this Dive bar, wings are phenomenal and service is always great!  Until..... The supposed Owner decided to come into the kitchen and try to boss everyone around. Very Rude too! The Cooks were doing an amazing job without him.  And then.... The owner decided to \"Try and help the kitchen\" and we witnessed him throw some RAW CHICKEN on the cutting board that the cooks were using to cut lettuce, tomatoes, dress the sandwiches & burgers etc.... THEN the next cooked sandwich comes out, he, the owner, places it on the exact spot the RAW chicken was to cut the sandwich and proceeds to deliver it to customers!!!!  I ran over and told the customers to NOT EAT THAT SANDWICH!! Well now, the customers had a very surprised look on their face, thanked me gratefully and I went back to my seat at the bar. Then the owner was not happy with me and told us to leave. We told him we were not leaving and that he was very unprofessional and rude to his staff, us and the customers that had been served the improperly prepared food.   I think the owner then realized he had made a huge mistake and said nothing else to us. And he never apologized and never owned up to his mistake of preparing food.   As long as he is NOT in the kitchen, we will gladly eat here anytime as we witnessed the cooks in the kitchen doing a fantastic cleanly proper job. This is an open kitchen, so you can see all food being prepared at all times."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this family establishment best burger I've had anywhere all my life I go in often with a craving for there food the whole menu is amazing"}
{"text":"Dive bar, mainly domestics on draft. Their prices are very reasonable, hot wings had a crispy outside, tasty, above average wings, I would come back when I feel like beer and wings!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal. I'm giving 5 stars to the staff because they are all awesome. They are always freakin' AWESOME. I'm giving 4 stars for the food. It's pretty damn good and especially so for more of a dive-type bar (which I LOVE dive bars).   Here's the kicker... ZERO stars for the seating and most uncomfortable, po-dunk, cheap-ass, trailer park, homemade, ass-cramping booths I have ever had to sit in. In all seriousness, this place has lost business from my lunch crowd because we would often rather go eat lesser quality food and be comfortable than piss off our precious taints by sitting in those booths for mare than 5 minutes.  To the owner, please, please, PLEASE, for the love of our backs, tear those crap booths out and put something comfortable in. I truly believe you will gain more business by doing so. Until then, you average 3 stars... I almost made it 2 stars just to spite your booths."}
{"text":"I've  been coming here for close to 15 years... every time it gets worse. Food that used to be awesome, has gown seriously downhill and so has the service. We wont be back."}
{"text":"Great little bar & grill with great food. Wings are spot on and have good heat! Nice size menu with lots of options, the staff treats you very friendly and are very attentive. The day that I tried them for the first time was for lunch and noticed a good spread of patrons with everything from single diners to families to a table of suits & ties. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"First (and only) Half of Review:   I happened into this dive bar/grill recently since it's near my NoPho / Ghettro-Center 'hood.   Stackers gets points for having a few different beers on tap (Bass, I can't remember the rest) along with the regular boring finds. That's all I was there for at the time.   I did not eat, but they seemed to offer a lot in the way of typical bar food. Maybe they have super delicious food, maybe not. I'll never know.   There would have been a second half to this review. There would have been a follow-up where I found the place interesting enough to go back when I could sample the food, too, because I did find the place interesting enough to warrant that second visit. That's what I was planning to do as I sipped my beer.   But there isn't going to be a second half to this review.   It all came down to watching a skinny dude in a cap come in from out front -- obviously smoking cigarettes -- and proceed to gather ingredients and utensils and then actually make what looked like a big jug of tartar sauce, or something, and then prepping other items, WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS.!!  This is inexcusable.  Skinny cap dude was not the cook at the time, a young lady was at the grill, but he was doing prep work in the back.  The trouble seemed like only him, so I resist my temptation to hard-nose and give only 1 star, and give them 2 instead.  I had so completely planned to go back and try out what seemed like it was going to be some good bar & grill grub, but I just couldn't bring myself to do so. Maybe if I were to run out of other places to check out I'll try it again, but not if skinny cap dude is anywhere in my sight.   For me Stacker's has fallen before even getting a chance, like a barely played out game of Jenga ruined by a clumsy player."}
{"text":"Stackers is a quintessential Phoenix dive bar. It's got that old dingy feel to it. I didn't try the food here, but they do have fairly cheap beer and cocktails available. I want to come back to try their highly regarded chicken wings. If you're in the neighborhood...this is a fine place to drop by and get a beer."}
{"text":"Decent dive bar. 2 dollar domestic pints, and Happy Hour too from 4.30 to 7 (I think)."}
{"text":"Was afraid to go here alone for the first time. Almost looks like a Cheers kinda place where only older guys go and have been going for years. You know the kind.. Where you walk in and the regulars give you a dirty look and you immediately feel unwanted and uncomfortable.  Well.. That isn't so here.  I've been wanting to go for a while but as a single woman was a bit scared. So I took a guy friend. We were both pleasantly surprised.  Staff was good. Drinks and food were good. Only drawback was when our food was brought to the table... The cook ran his arm across my friends straw instead of asking us to move the drink so he could reach the table better. YUCK!  Server apologized and got us a new straw.  I'll be back... Even alone. But I'll make sure that my drink is out of the way when the food comes next time."}
