{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover! This place from the outside may look questionable, but once you get inside everything changes. Some of the best Mexican food I've eaten in a long time! Great ambiance, fast and attentive service. Green salsa is soooo good! You won't be disappointed. Only reason I didn't give 5-stars was because I was charged for an item I did not receive or even ask for. Upon bringing this to their attention they apologized and fixed my ticket. Great little Mexican joint. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing we came here without knowing that they were going to close soon. Waiter was like no welcome come in. Food was amazing lots of flavor. Sweet green salsa was delicious and the drinks had the crunchy delicious ice super dank!!!#"}
{"text":"The food is great! This is one of my favorite Mexican places. Reminds me of the flavors that I ate at the family's fav restaurant in California."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all and a little disappointed. The red salsa not spicy or flavorful and the green one was sweet which I was not aware of until I took a huge bite , it took forever to get a waiter and the food not so good I make better tacos at home but, I did like the happy hour price of $2.99 for the margaritas"}
{"text":"First to respond to some of the other reviews and folks who reviewed on other sites regarding the locale.  Yes, it is in a strip mall.  Not a fancy strip mall but we didn't have any plans on eating in the parking lot.  I'm not sure why the issue of safety is raised as we didn't feel there were any safety concerns.  Inside is very clean and the atmosphere is casual.  Enough said about that.

We felt from the menu offerings that there is a great west coast (of Mexico) influence.  There are many seafood options and also the offering of spanish rice contributed to our feeling of the \"west\".

In terms of the salsa.  The green salsa is sweet but they bring that along side a red salsa that has a nice little kick to it.  Alternating between the two was surprisingly grand.  They so nicely complimented each other.

The first time I try a new Mexican restaurant I always have the mole.  I figure if they do a good job on this complex sauce then they do a good job on everything.  I had the chicken enchiladas in mole sauce and it was great.  We didn't see just chicken mole on the menu, only this dish, but our waiter said no problem.  Great to know when we return.  My partner had a shrimp burrito with a pineapple salsa.  The burrito was filled with alot of good meaty shrimp and the taste was extremely good.  

Prices are reasonable and the service was very courteous and efficient.  What more can I ask for?  We will be back.  As a side note, the menu on their website is quite abbreviated and I believe it does a disservice to the restaurant.  The actual menu is varied and offers many choices."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying a new Mexican place while working in the east valley, and the Yelp reviews seemed promising. But I have to say I'm disappointed. I ordered the chicken chimichanga platter. I really don't care for the seasoning of the chicken, or of the rice for that matter. The chimi tasted almost burned. The service was good, but the food was \"meh\". For my money, I'd much prefer to eat at Manuel's."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent.  We took a chance on this restaurant since we don't live in the area and we made a good decision. The atmosphere was a spot on with what we were looking for.  Try the green salsa as well as the beans."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Margaritas...yes please!!! 
Ambiance was great. Service was on point. Food was fresh and delicious. I ordered the spinach enchiladas which were pretty good. Tried my friends mole enchiladas, even better!! Overall...really good!!"}
{"text":"Great Food & Drinks, friendly staff, perfect place to bring your family."}
{"text":"Terrible I have no idea how this place has 4 stars. Our table legs were all uneven causing the table tip all directions so we moved tables to the one right next to us which had a dirty cleaning rag just left on it. The salsas they give you with the chips are just weird the red one taste like straight rosemary and the green one is sweet? My chicken burrito was completely dry no sauce on it or anything. Our waitress was nice enough but never saw her again after she brought our food my boyfriends drink was empty for the last 15 mins we were there and we had to track her down to pay. So sad I wasted my money there will never be back."}
{"text":"The Original Rosa's Mexican Grille gets 5 STARS for Best Fish and Shrimp Tacos! Best Chicken Mole! Best Chimichanga! Best Tomatillo Salsa Verde! And Best Place to Take Your Out-Of-Towners!  

We have been going to Tia Rosa's with our family for what seems like over 15 or more years now, starting with their original Mesa Drive and University location as well as the second East McKellips and newly opened Gilbert restaurant at Higley and Warner.

I originally heard about Rosa's reading a New Time's Best of Phoenix review and first  we tried the \"Plato de Chimichanga\" with oven roasted and marinated for two days beef or pork.  All in all it got 5 STARS and has been my wife Karolien's favorite and staple for many years since.  This dish earns your loyalty and respect with it's tender taste!  Includes Spanish Rice and delicious smoked beans topped with sour cream, plenty of guacamole and cheese!  She also loves their Pineapple Avocado Salad and has order another Mango Salad in the past which she swears by!

\"Why I keep coming back time and time again?\"; Rosa's gets TOP HONORS FIVE STARS as the BEST TAQUERIA in the Valley of the Sun hands down for their Beef, Chicken, Pork, or what I always order fresh Fish and Shrimp soft tacos!

Their Baja Style Sauted Shrimp Tacos with pineapple salsa are what they say; \"To Die For!\" Juicy and tender I have never found any other contenders even on the beaches in Mexico!  I love to top the shrimp taco with Rosa's Best Green Tomatillo Salsa Award that I have yet to find that green is sssooooo addictive beware!.  

The fish soft taco either your choice of grilled Salmon or Halibut comes stuffed with red Cabbage and Orange Mango Salsa are my absolute favorites.  Are you kidding me!  Anyone looking for the BEST SEAFOOD, FISH OR SHRIMP TACOS IN PHOENIX YOUR LOOK IS OVER....DRIVE TO THE EAST VALLEY!  The 2 item plate comes with delicious Spanish Rice and those oooohhhh so good smoked baked beans!

It even gets better as I absolutely love Tia's \"Plato de Carne Asada\" which I understand is a 12 spice marinated beef or pork slowly oven roasted for 10 hours, and then charbroiled over an open flame!  It comes to your table smoking hot and I love many flavors and so get the combo Beef, Pork, and Chicken!  Put it this way I am getting hungry just thinking about how good this dish is!  

I forgot to mention Rosa's takes the prize for Best Chicken Mole!  Which includes six varieties of chilies, 22 spices, herbs, nuts, fruits and chocolate blended together in this classic Mexican sauce. It comes garnished with sesame seeds and served with rice and tortillas!  This sauce is king!  Delicious and never greasy!  It is a true art to have an award winning Mole!

So grab the whole family and set a date for Rosa's and Rancho de Tia Rosa's in Mesa and Gilbert, call ahead on weekends to get placed on the waiting list, you will not be disappointed and any miles driven will be well rewarded!  They have earned every one of these FIVE STAR Awards as good as it gets!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite TeX Mex place.  I've been coming to Rosa's for many years and I haven't had any bad experiences. Rosa's was always one of the restaurants on my \"visiting home from college\" list. 

First: Decor
The place looks nice but tiles are EVERYWHERE.  And yes they're pretty and colorful, but sometimes it can be a little hard to keep your balance when walking to the bathroom and your chair will not stop rocking.  The cheap paintings and plants are OK, definitely better now than ten years ago.  Overall not great, but WAAYYY better than El Charro.

Second:  Service
The service can be hit or miss.  Some days it seems like they have enough servers and things are done in a timely manner, but some days the whole place is just off.  Like it will take forever to get drinks, and then an eternity to get food, and then you get sick and tired of waiting to pay the server so you end up taking your bill to the front counter and have whoever is up there ring you up.  But those days are few and far between, and most of the time the people are nice and quick.

Third:  Food
As I mentioned I've been a regular for quite some time, and so I've tried everything on their menu and not one complaint.  My usual is the shrimp tacos, but I also enjoy anything beef especially the nachos.  The only down side is probably their salsa, its a bit too watery and not spicy enough but I ask for habanero sauce and that definitely punches up the spice.  And while I enjoy the taste and texture of the food as I eat it, I also greatly appreciate the fact that it doesn't \"mess me up\" later in the evening.  Most other Mexican food I have usually results in me re-enacting a traumatizing scene from Dumb and Dumber, but Rosa's doesn't.  All in all, the food is good.

In summary, Rosa's is and will always be my standard for TeX Mex."}
{"text":"great service and atmosphere. reasonable prices solid portions and everything I put in my mouth was awesome. dig the tart margaritas. cheapest thing on the menu, the bean dip I think is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I remember this place from nearly 20 years ago on a family trip to Arizona and it was fantastic! They had a great coloring contest for kids to keep them occupied while they wait for the food and I won! Great beans, I remember that was my sister's favorite dish!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place.  What a find.  Thank you Yelp reviewers.  Terrific flavors without the oversized platter full of forgettable sauce/gravy covering everything!  Each item stands by itself with unique sauce/flavoring.  My favorite test of a Mexican menu  is the basic cheese & onion enchilada, and theirs is definitely a home run!   This will be a \"must stop\" every time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Good mexican food and nice service. I recommend"}
{"text":"Red salsa is decent, green is really sweet for some odd reason. The margaritas taste exactly like the Jose Cuervo premixed ones - that's not a good thing. We also received the margaritas AFTER the gentleman behind us who came in approximately 5-7 min after us. Didn't like the place enough to try out any food although the menu did look promising and authentic."}
{"text":"I have been living in New Orleans for a long time, so I have admittedly low standards for tacos and tex-mex. While in town for a conference, I stopped by Rosa's for lunch, and got the fish taco plate with beans and rice. The fish taco was very good. If I had been in town longer, I probably would have gone back again for dinner. And like another commenter said, the faucet shaped like a pump in the women's bathroom is pretty great."}
{"text":"$40 for two adults and one kid. Red salsa was sweet versus spicy. The chimi was dry. It was full of meat, would of been delicious if there would of been cheese and sour cream inside with the meat or at least all over the top outside."}
{"text":"We love Rosa's!  We come here at least once a month with all 5 of our children.  We especially love \"kids eat free on Tuesday\" for obvious reasons.  The service is always great.  Food is good and comes out very quickly.  Great family owned restaurant!"}
{"text":"Took my son and his buddy to Rosa's. The service was a bit slow but the food was great. The retried beans are the best I have had in a long time. And the salsa was spectacular. I had the pork tamale with enchilada sauce, it was ok.  My son got the rolled tacos and his buddy got the shrimp taco. They thought it was good."}
{"text":"My parents love this place.  How they found it I'll never know.  The food didn't blow me away, but it was good. I would return if invited by someone, but would go there again on my own.

Bit of a scary neighborhood though - lock your car doors!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  The food is tasty and we love not having to worry about lard in the tortillas and beans.  Rosa's is a great choice for vegetarians that love cheese enchiladas and veggie burritos.

The location is a little bleak, but the waiters have always been friendly to us, and they really hussle during busy times."}
{"text":"Great food. Lots of meat! Fun environment. Can be busy at times. We have made it a family tradition to visit the restaurant anytime we are in the area. We are never disappointed with the quality of service or taste of the food."}
{"text":"Service was excellent...prompt, friendly and complete. Food was delicious! Tamale was good but not as good as mom's, but on the other hand, who can beat mom!!! Chicken mango salad was enormous!!!!
Not realizing the restaurant had closed, we were not hurried, or felt rushed in any way as we stayed one hour beyond closing!! Super experience"}
{"text":"After all these years, Rosa's is still one of my favorite Mexican places in the Phoenix area. I've been going here for well over 10 years, and we still make occasional trips to old town Mesa for their signature meats.

Our favorites:
* Plato de carne: basically a huge fajita plate with better meat--you get your choice of meat with grilled veggies, beans & rice, and tortillas
* Chicken chimichanga: their chicken is marinated and always fabulous, and I'm a sucker for a good chimi
* Salmon tacos: big chunks of salmon, white cheddar, and homemade mango salsa--my wife's staple.

I give it 4 stars since those salmon tacos have lost some of their original luster. They used to bring tears to your eyes, but I think they're skimping on the salsa a bit nowadays.

Service is consistently good, as are the chips and salsa. The beans, as others have mentioned, are superb. You won't leave any on your plate."}
{"text":"I have seen a number of posts
 looking for authentic Baja style fish tacos here in the Phoenix area.. At 328 E. University drive in Mesa (NW corner of University and Mesa drives) Rosa's Mexican Grill serves fish tacos in 3 varieties: white fish, salmon and shrimp tacos. They are marinated and grilled, not fried. and topped with an excellent verde salsa."}
{"text":"I hate to do this.  We love the food here.  However two of the last four times we had to leave without being helped.  

Today might have been it for me and we have been going there for about 15 years.  

Walked in.  Greeted by a young man typing something into the computer.  We figured it must be something important because 10 minutes later we were still standing there.  

My wife got annoyed first then me.  We saw that there were a lot of tables with no food and what we perceived as customers that waited too long. 

It was about 12:30 to 1:00.  They were not that busy.  There was another waiter filling drinks and helping other guests.  

I saw no one else. If you cannot afford to pay staff please close your doors.  I was looking forward to eating there and it is not a short trip.  

Most likely my last trip.  I will miss the #7 - green corn tamales a chicken enchilada.  So long old friend.

Oh and the time we left... We were seated but no one showed up to take the order (maybe three months ago.)."}
{"text":"Angel the waiter is great the food fabulous place vary clean friendly los platillos geniales"}
{"text":"I had planned on grabbing some McD's and saw the bright lights of Rosa's in the same parking lot.  I saw it as a sign to avoid fastfood for tonight.

I ordered the Plato de Carne Pork.  The portions were HUGE.  I probably ate about 1/2 the port.  

My fav part of the meal was the free chips and salsa.  The red salsa was great.  The green salsa was addicting!

Total damage was $19 including tip."}
{"text":"UPDATE Oct. 2013: I went there again this weekend and it was just like the good old days.  The service was great and the food was absolutely the best food I have ever eaten there.  I got the Nachos with chicken and beef and the flavors of both are amongst some of the best flavored meats I have had anywhere.  They have also remodeled in the past few months and it looks really great.  They added new booths that look nice and are comfortable.


This used to be my favorite mexican restaurant.  However, over the last few years it has really been a disappointment.  My most recent visit a week ago was horrible.  They got both orders at my table wrong.  I sent mine back and it came back wrong a second time.  I was so annoyed I ended up just picking it apart and eating the chicken.  My friends just ate hers the way it came. The server offered no apology and I just couldn't wait to pay the check and leave."}
{"text":"The sweet 'n spicy pulled pork is excellent! Had it in an enchilada, with a pork tamale, everything was great!"}
{"text":"Couldn't believe how empty it was here for Cinco de Mayo! Nice menu, quality food, friendly service and a solid happy hour. Strong margaritas. Nice, casual atmosphere and above average, varied and large Mexican dishes."}
{"text":"This place has really good Mexican food. Ok place- not too fancy - not too much of a dive.  Service is good. Atmosphere is perfect for Authentic Mexican food. We go with our large family often. They do a great job keeping up with all of us. We also go as a couple often. I recommend it to anyone. 

I think I've had everything on the menu and would recommend it all. They have some hot sauce that you have to ask for that is amazing. Ask for the spicy salsa or if you are up to it the habanero salsa :)"}
{"text":"Great food! We went with a group of people and we all ordered different things. Everything tasted great and was very fresh. Loved it and we will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Would not recommend if you want any flavor in your protein. The chicken in our tacos had zero taste, it was cooked, yes. I guess that's a plus. Fajitas were not bad. Margarita was ok. Interior has a nice Spanish/mexican decor. Service is average. Not worth going again. I ate very little."}
{"text":"We ate here last night. The food was good and the service was good. Nice atmosphere. Seems to be a popular place but not a long wait."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food, although our waiter got our order wrong twice. I'd recommend this restaurant again. There was so much food I had no room for dessert. Be warned. The desserts look great!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Ignore the location, it's obviously not the best but the food is delicious.  If you are worried about location, go to Tia Rosa's up on McKellips which has much better ambiance with the same food.  All of their meat tastes like to is lightly smoked which really adds to the flavor.  This location is also great for lunch if you have business in downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"So glad we found this hidden gem  saw they had some good reviews on Yelp and decided to give them a try. 
Arrived and the outside was a little iffy, but we walked in and they had a good lunch crowd.
They inside is super cute, and our sever was nice and prompt. The food was so good! I had the Flying Saucer with pork, the pork was marinated well. My boyfriend had the Mole Enchiladas, which was excellent! It had a chocolate taste to it. 
Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Guys trust me, don't let looks deceive you this food here is killer!! The green salsa is heavenly! Endless bowls of hot chips and fresh salsa. Margaritas are divine. My go to meal here is the stuffed quesadilla with pork and smothered enchilada style with green sauce! It's like nothing you've ever eaten before!!! Also the smokey refried beans are outta this world."}
{"text":"I like Rosa's. 
Being that I've resigned myself to never again eating the great cheap Mexican food I had in Chicago (or even in Madison), I might have just lowered my standards -- but I think that Rosa's serves inexpensive and tasty food.
I know some other reviewers have complained about the atmosphere, but I think the place is cute. Also, our waiters have always been really friendly. The last time I was there, we were served by a guy named Juan and he was the most outgoing, responsive and sweet waiter I've had in a really, really long time.
I've only been here for lunch, so I usually have the lunch specials, which are in the $6 range. I feel like I get a pretty good deal, and the service is quick."}
{"text":"Omg I can drink the salsa tomatillo. Wish this place were closer to home."}
{"text":"Sorry, I didn't actually get to eat here because I walked out after 5 minutes, waiting for the hostess to acknowledge us.  While she was on the phone taking take-out orders, we waited, only to be told that there was a 15 to 20 minute wait...and the place was half empty.  So this place needs to decide if its take-out business is more of a priority than sit-down; because it doesn't look like they can do both."}
{"text":"Smoked beef is the best. My favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"First of all I'm originally from New Mexico so I like hot green and flavorful red...This isn't for me, and I so wanted to really like it.  As others have mentioned in numerous reviews, they put a sweet twist on a lot of their items.  The Green Tomatilla Salsa definitely has sugar or agave nectar in it and the red salsa is bolder in flavor but still has a sweet taste to it. I opted for the Pork Burrito Enchilada style with green sauce.  Again I couldn't escape the sweetness factor of the pork.  I can tell that they marinade the pork in Orange Juice for long periods of time to achieve this flavor.  Many regions of Southern Mexico prefer a sweet versus hot flavor in their food. It wasn't horrible by any means, just not what I'm accustomed to.  The Rice was very mediocre, no flavor or Authenticity.  The beans on the other hand were a little different in achieving a smoky flavor.  Most good places simply use bacon drippings to achieve the flavor.  With Rosa's it tastes more like they added liquid smoke.  Again not horrible, just not for me, as I know my preferences and know My top 5-10 places in Maricopa County to go.  Service was friendly and restaurant is clean.  Go here if you like a sweet twist on Mexican Food.  They've been around a long time so obviously they have their Clientele."}
{"text":"Looks like a hole in the wall but it's pretty good.  Good service, good food, good prices.  They have specials every once in a while so we go when we get our mailed coupons (cuz we're cheap like that.)"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Nice atmosphere.  A bit expensive for Mexican food.  Kind of noisy, some party was in the room next door.  

The red salsa was very good.  The green salsa was a bit too sweet.  The chips were crisp and fresh.

Got the cheese enchilada lunch special.  One of the best I've ever had.  The beans very nice and covered with cheese.  The rice was kind of boring, but not bad.

The service was great."}
{"text":"My sister and I love this place! Even though the location seems a little iffy - the food and the service is great.  Try the shredded beef chimichanga...I don't know what they do to their beef, but I love it."}
{"text":"Ok..seriously just ok. Green salsa was horribly sweet and gel like. It had no taste of tomatillo in it. The tacos were stuffed to the gills but average. The chimis tasted reheated in the microwave and oddly like sopapillas. Over all ok food but a bit pricy for ok food."}
{"text":"Started as a small taco shop by a missionary to Mexico and has expanded several times over the years. You will not find one bad or so-so item on the menu! The meats are simmered over many hours to perfect flavor and temperature. 

The Plato de Carne is quite a large portion too. They have several different types of salas so you have to ask not only the \"hot\" one but there's a habanero that is many levels higher than that! 

One of my all time favorites in the heart of Mesa."}
{"text":"The food was good for american type mexican food. I got the enchiladas with rice and beans and the margarita was huge, but not much alcohol. The flan was the best flan I ever had! so creamy and sweet!  The service was quick and very friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place and eat here about once every other month and an excited I'm going today!"}
{"text":"There food has gone steadily down hill. Ate there several months ago, and it was good. Ate there a month ago, and just OK.Ate there last night and had a burro I couldn't even eat. I don't know how else to describe it, but the meat tasted \"dirty\" A bad flavor, and no spices to speak of. There chips are ok, but their salsa is really bland. Service is good, but there food is going south real fast. I would not recommend them. There was a current change in ownership, which i will blame on the tepid food."}
{"text":"Read all the reviews & decided to give it a try. Our family did Not like anything but the beans! EVERYTHING was SWEET, green salsa, enchilada sauce, masa on tamale, SWEET!?!?  Service sucked as well."}
{"text":"Pretty sure I just had the best shrimp burrito I've ever had.  Other than no soap in the baño, it was a good experience.  Oh, and the margaritas are 1/2 gallon sized...rediculous ; )"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Margaritas are very tasty. The salsa with the chips was just the right level of spice. I had the sweet and spicy pork salad and it was great. Good and spicy"}
{"text":"In Short: Awesome food, one of the best places for authentic mexican food in the valley.

I've been going here for a while and I've never been disappointed.  It looks a bit sketchy from the outside but once you walk in, you're going to be pretty happy.  

Before you start the meal they'll bring a heap of fresh tortilla chips and two salsas.  I find the green one too sweet and the red one with pineapple lacks a real kick.  If you ask them they'll bring two other varieties one is about medium hotness and the other one is the habenero salsa.  Be careful with that one, it's really hot, but I find it if you mix that with the green salsa, it's pretty damn good.  

I love their enchiladas, the monterrey enchiladas being my favorite.  They have massive burritos and chimichangas too, can't go wrong with most of the items on the menu.  It's one of the only places in the valley with a decent horchata, there's a just a hint of cinnamon, making it near perfection.  Definitely save room for some flan, it's so creamy and delicious, perfect way to cap off a spicy dinner."}
{"text":"Got carry out and even the customer service over the phone was excellent.  We tried the enchiladas, sweet n spicy pork salad, flan. All were delicious! They gave us two types of salsa we loved the red one but found the green too sweet for our taste.  Thrilled that we were given enough flatware and napkins too. We will be back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Rosa's is kind of a Mormon staple - it's being so close to the Temple and all.  I have been there countless times, but my last visit on June 3, 2009 was an unqualified disaster.  Service was painfully slow.  The food, normally good for Baja, was lousy.  We complained to the person who was pointed out as the manager - Bert - and he was less than interested in our problem.  He basically said, \"There's nothing I can do for you.\"  Awesome business skills.  Well, there is something we can do for him.  The five of us, and our families and anyone we can dissuade, will not be patronizing Rosa's ever again.  There is a lot better Baja in the Valley.  I think they are resting on their laurels.  Oh, and the best part?  We found out that the good regular chef wasn't there - and that a DISHWASHER had been recruited to fill in with the other regular chef.  Seems that clogged up the kitchen, because it took them a while to call in another dishwasher."}
{"text":"This is a very nice little neighborhood Mexican restaurant. The neighborhood itself is a little sketchy, but the inside of this place has a welcoming atmosphere with some beautiful colorful decor. Rosa's has been serving Mesa residents \"Baja Style\" Mexican food for over 20 years. I love chips and salsa and they gave us a couple salsa choices. The green salsa had a very flavorful sweet taste to it. My buddies got tamales and really enjoyed them. I went for the cheese enchilada and chile relleno combo plate. I love how Mexican dishes all blend together and this plate was no different. My enchilada just oozed with cheese (and served Christmas style - both red and green sauce) and the asado poblano chile was nicely battered and cooked. This place was an awesome unexpected find for us and the customer service was great too! I never take for granted the great Mexican food we have here in AZ."}
{"text":"Visiting for spring training so naturally used Yelp to find a place to eat. As some of the other helpers have indicated, this place looks like a dive from the outside, but inside it is very nice and reminiscent of old Mexico. The service was excellent and the margaritas delicious. The chips and salsa were delicious - chips thin and crispy. Prices are good. My husband had the fish tacos and I had the flying saucer which is essentially a large tostada. My husband enjoyed his fish tacos (I don't really like fish tacos so I didn't try them). I really wanted to like the flying saucer but just couldn't find anything special about it. The tortilla was overcooked - almost burnt. There weren't enough beans or salsa, and the pork was dry. And this is supposed to be their house specialty.  

Came back a year later. (I'd forgotten my earlier review!  this time I ordered carnitas tacos. Very good. We ordered a second round of margaritas that never came, but we were charged. Fortunately, I was looking for that and got the charges taken off! The food was brought quickly but then she never came back and we had to go wait at the cash register. This is a very cute place, but needs to get its act together!"}
{"text":"If I could eat only at one restaurant for the rest of my life, this would be the place!

It's definitely a hole-in-the-wall joint, but if you're looking for seriously delicious Mexican, this is the place to go!

I've had basically everything on the menu, and everything is scrumptious, but here are my staples:

Chips and Salsa - They do provide complementary chips and salsa and I could drink their salsa verde... both the red and green salsas are sweet, but they pair well with the fresh chips. 

Bean Dip - The smoky refried beans are mixed with cheese... heaven in a bowl.

Pineapple Avocado Salad - Try it with chicken... makes for a great \"light\" lunch. The poppy seed dressing is refreshing.

Green Chile Burro - Holy cow. This massive burro is literally bursting with  green chile beef (their delectable carne asada mixed with roasted green chiles). Try it enchilada style with green sauce. You will go home with leftovers with this one.

Plato de Carne Asada (or Carnitas) - Either way, this is a huge plate of meat. The meat is so tender, juicy, and flavorful that it will satisfy even the most finicky Midwesterner. If you get the carnitas (pork), ask for extra limes for making your tacos... totally delish!

Shrimp Tacos - This is the dish I would choose as my last meal (along with another side of refried beans and their chips and green salsa). This is Baja at its best with tender, flavorful shrimp (cooked in a honey butter sauce) served with pineapple salsa that rivals the greatness that is their salsa verde. I've never been a fan of corn tortillas, but with the honey butter sauce soaked into the tortilla, I'd eat a dozen tortillas no questions asked. 

Shrimp Mazatlan - Big sweet shrimp grilled on a skewer with that same yummy honey butter sauce served with a skewer of grilled vegetables and pineapple over rice. So good.

Enchiladas Monterey - The same great carne asada in enchilada form. Get 'em both with green sauce. You can thank me later.

Plato de Chimichanga - This is good any way you get it. Seriously. 

Refried Beans - I never liked beans until I tasted Rosa's refried beans so many years ago... smoky and delicious. I can't get enough of these beans... and find myself licking the plate to get every morsel in. 

Rice - I love red rice, and Rosa's rice doesn't disappoint. The great texture comes from little bits of carrot mixed in.

The prices are really reasonable, and the portions do not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant. Their happy hour goes until 8pm. I got an awesome $3 Margarita. 

The shrimp tacos were tasty, but what made them extra special was the pineapple salsa that comes on them.

The neighborhood is pretty run down, but once inside the restaurant everything is great."}
{"text":"This place has been a family favorite for 20 years. We use to take people from out of town to Rosa's right away... and usually came back with the same friends for at least one meal before they left.  Not any more. We have eaten here for our last time.  The food is barely passable now.  So sad.  In January, the cost for a pitcher of Margarita's went up $15.00 in price over night.  We had a pitcher on a Tuesday afternoon and by Saturday, the cost increase happened.  The server knows us well and yet did not warn us. We basically felt cheated as if a best friend pulled a sneaky thing on us.  Now they are increasing the food prices by huge margins but not increasing their offerings while the quality is slipping fast.  (DO NOT EAT THE BEEF FAJITAS! I was sick for hours after I tried to eat 1/4 of what was served.  The texture was weird, like pressed meat (?) and the flavor was well, yuk.   ... 

This use to be a place we went to 3-6 times per month but we are looking for a new mexican hangout.  So sad"}
{"text":"Suggested by someone we met and did not live up to the hype. We orders mini chimi appetizer, enchiladas (chicken beef pork and cheese), chicken burro, and a beef soft taco. Chicken was DRY DRY DRY. ALL the enchiladas were undercooked. The corn tortillas were sooo dry and chewy. Beef was flavorless like it wasn't seasoned. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype.

Bean tacos- just okay.  Spinach enchiladas- just okay.  Chips and salsa- just okay. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Margaritas are sweet and potent. The interior has Mexican written all over it. Very authentic. Service was excellent.  The red salsa didn't have any bite but I enjoyed it. It tasted roasted and had a fruity flavor (pineapple or mango, I suppose). The green salsa looked like tomatillo salsa to me. I loved it. Flavorful and hearty, although it was a tad sweeter than I am used to.

My steak fajitas came out on fire - awesome. The meat was flavorful and so tender! I asked for another type of sauce. A mild sauce. So the waiter got me the perfect dark red sauce with just the right kick.  Poured the sauce all over my fajitas and was on my way to grubbin'.

The margaritas were $2.99 - can't beat that.  I had three.  I jogged back to the hotel in case anyone was wondering...sike."}
{"text":"In town for Cubs Spring Training and yelped a few Mexican restuarants, hit the jackpot here.  Clean, authentic decor, not a fast food stop.  Delicious,  fresh ingredients used in our dinners.  Fast, friendly staff, think family owned and care atmosphere.  In a strip mall corner but walk in and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went to Rosa's on a weekday at noon and it was deserted. There were 4 of us and we each ordered something different. Our orders came out and the meats were very dry and had any flavor. The staffing was minimal and it showed. The Care Asada was inedible and sent back.
They have raised the price of drinks quite a bit as well.
I did like their green salsa, refried beans and chips a lot. However, between the increased prices and so so food, we will not be back. There are too many great mexican restaurants in Phoenix to make a trip to this one.
Too bad as this used to be one of our favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Great chicken tacos. Service started off a little slow but it improved through out the meal. Definitely am coming back for the tacos :)"}
{"text":"Delicious dinner & great service!!  We are visiting Scottsdale for spring training & found Rosas on Yelp.  Reviews looked good so we decided to try it & we're so glad we did!   Very authentic ambiance with very friendly staff.   Our server was sweet, kind & attentive.   Chips & salsa were really good.  Chicken fajitas were excellent (steak & shrimp fajitas not as good).  All the sides that came with fajitas were great too-the guac & the rice & beans.  The beans had a good smokey flavor.  Our 11 yr old son LOVED the carne Asada tacos!  The meat was juicy, tender & very flavorful.   We would def go back next time in town!!!"}
{"text":"My food was B L A  N D. Atmosphere was quaint. Drinks were good. Service was very good. Don't feel the need to go back."}
{"text":"Based my choice on a rating from Yelp -- great flavored food, friendly service, and reasonable prices. Highly recommend if you're nearby, and have a desire for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Been going to Rosa's for over 20 years and has always been one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the Valley. Went again today for the first time in about a year. Wanted to say it was so good and bought back its heyday about 10 years ago. Everything was excellent food drink and service. Great happy hour margarita for $3.50. Red chili beef and pork soooo good. Can't wait for my next trip. Try it you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I have to write a review for this place. It's easily one of the best in the Valley, and it's where I always take out-of-town visitors to prove to them that the Mexican food where they live sucks. 

I've had burros (enchilada style!), nachos, and most recently the combo fajita platter. Easily the best fajitas I've had. The shrimp was nice and crisp, the chicken juicy, and the steak was marinated to perfection. Not to mention heaps of veggies, rice, and beans. Took half home for dinner the next day."}
{"text":"I will never go back. The beans had a Smokey taste like they were burnt. The service was slow. At 7:30 they were rushing us because they close at 8. Therefore the kitchen staff leaves at 7:45. The enchiladas were dry so I asked for more sauce and they charged me $1.35. I told them I wanted the mini quesadilla for my son from the kids menu and he gave us that AND a cheese crisp and even though I didn't order it I had to pay for that. The green salsa was super sweet as if they poured a ton of sugar in it. The price was super high for what you get. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Great food and great environment. I visit the PHX area a couple times a year and make Rosa's a must stop."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, nice environment. Ok so I tried this place after reading the positive reviews and I must agree the outside parking lot is a bit crappy, but once you're in you'll soon forget about it. It has a nice traditional Mexican feel to it. The margarita's are tasty and the food is pretty good!

I went there with my family and we ordered the Plato de Carne( mixed meats) which was ok if you mix all the sauteed veggies with the meat because with out it the meat is pretty dry with little flavor. Although I must say if I was to order again I would get the chicken because it was very moist and flavorful. We also had the Shrimp plate, it was very good! I really enjoyed the grilled pineapples that accompany the shrimp. We did like that the plates come with lettuce, tom. s/c and guac. The salsa's are ok, I was excited to try the green that people raved about but was disappointed upon tasting it. The green sauce was very, very sweet with little- no hint of spice and the red wasn't much of an improvement.I did ask for something with a little more spice and the server brought out another but I think it was the same red? We ordered the bean dip and really enjoyed it (finger licking good) chips are very tasty and fresh.I would most definitely return and would not hesitate to bring others along to enjoy this great find!"}
{"text":"Great food! I had the fajitas and they were about perfect. The chips and salsa was very good too. Next time I'm in the Phoenix area I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here. We started with their home made tortilla chips and salsa. The chips were extremely light and flavorful. For main course had two meals; seafood tacos (1 shrimp,  1 fish) & chicken enchilada mole. Both meals were wonderful; plentiful and prepared to perfection. Our server was attentive,  without being over bearing. We'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Love this place and have been coming here for over 20 years. The retried beans have a smokey flavor that my picky husband loves. The meats are quality cuts of meat. Love the green tomatillo salsa  yes it's sweet but addicting. The decor is cute and inviting. Cute neighborhood restaurant that I hope stays around a long time."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry for the bad review, but this is for the sweet green enchiladas that I ordered they seem to put sugar instead of salt in the sauce it has a sweet flavor to it, and if you know anything about REAL authentic Mexican food you know that is a big NO."}
{"text":"We Yelped Mexican near our downtown Mesa hotel and the list was as long as my arm, but Rosa's specifically said they had sopapillas and I wanted some sugary fried dough, so I was sold :) 

The spot is in an older shopping plaza.  Once inside you are greeted with cute brick walls and an old school Mexican casita look and feel.  

We had a really attentive server who was on top of drinks, food and generally checking on us that we were happy.  

I started with a few margs on the rocks - they rocked and the chips and salsas.  I personally preferred the red salsa over the sweet green, but the latter grew on me.  For an entree I selected the chicken mole enchiladas.  The enchiladas were rich and delicious. Everything was just a little different than usual and the was a welcome surprise!  And of course, I got my sopapillas for dessert and they were yummy fried goodness (they had flan and fried ice cream too if that floats your boat).  

I am surprised we never went back during our stay, but were so on the go we just didn't make it in again, but I would go back if in Mesa in a second!"}
{"text":"Good solid mexican food.  Great Margaritas.  See photos..."}
{"text":"Service was good. My enchilada was bland, hardly any sauce, same with cheese. Beans were dry and had a smoked flavor was added, did not eat. Rice was not any better except cooked. We will never eat here again. Green sweet salsa that came with chips were wasn't what I was used too. I like heat in the salsa not sugar sweet."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  The cheese crisp is awesome. A simple cheese crisp but made on a tortilla that stays crispy.  The chimis are stuffed with so much meat.  Great little MeXican restaurant.  My daughter loves the sink in the girls restroom..a tin bucket."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. It was decent service. Their red salsa was good. The green salsa was sweet which I wasn't used to, but not bad. I ordered the tamale and it was pretty dry. Was not a big fan of it."}
{"text":"Big portions, great food, salsa was amazing as well as my chimichanga . My party tried the Shrimp and pineapple dish and loved it as well, the tamales are to die for and should defiantly be tried and tried again. I live in Florida but anytime I'm back in Mesa I will be eating here!"}
{"text":"I accidentally ordered the wrong menu item and they gladly got me what I really wanted. The chicken chimichanga is huge and I had enough for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Rosa's since it was an unknown hole-in-the-wall. No longer unknown -- nearly any time of day finds the place packed -- and occupying several times the space it started with, Rosa's could still technically qualify as a \"hole.\" But no mater; the food at Rosa's is about as good as Mexican gets. Housed in a run down Mesa strip-mall, this unlikely epicurean delight serves traditional Sonora-style Mexican food, topped with five different kinds of homemade salsa (watch out for the  habanero --it will strip the enamel off your teeth). 

But it's the soft tacos that are Rosa's real glory: beef, pork, and chicken are marinated in fruit juices and herbs for 12 hours, slowly oven-baked for another 10, then shredded and charbroiled. And the fish taco is in a class by itself. Mmm... I think a taco run is in order...

I only deducted a star because the wait can be very long and therefore the service slow. But I'd love Rosa's if I had to wait all day!"}
{"text":"We love Rosa's!! Its the perfect place for a group as they accommodate large parties and kids. I love the chicken mole, cheese crisps, and shredded beef tacos, and the salsa is delicious!"}
{"text":"This moderately priced place really rocks.  I can't even begin to tell you how happy I get when I think about a potential lunch or dinner there.

Because it's so good, Rosa's is usually packed.  Lunch time is just plain INSANITY!  Groups of parties with with 10-14 seem to be quite the norm.

I've been there consistently for the past 3 months and I've yet to see the restaurant have dirty floors, bathrooms or unfriendly and slow servers.

I've tried just about every dish they have and I would recommend the Flying Saucer or the Chimichanga Plate.

The meats are heavenly -- they are spiced just right, are flavorful and juicy.  The chicken has never been dry in all the times I've eaten there.

Ok, I'm cutting this review short -- I'm heading out to Rosa's.  Hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood is a bit crusty around this location. And the strip mall and outer appearance don't do this place justice.
You don't hold out much hope for the inside, but it's actually quite pleasant. Beautiful colorful tiles and decorations fill the place. Very nice decor.
We were seated quickly and our waiter was very nice.
I got the special listed- Al Pastor burrito and my husband got the chicken chimi.
Food came out in a standard amount of time and it was heaven on a plate. So much frickin flavor packed in that burrito it was unbelievable. I enjoyed every bite. Didn't come with sour cream or guac, but I just stole my husbands. ;)
My husband said his chimi was ok. They put a LOT of meat in it...which was fine...but it was a little dry.
We got a Margarita, Corona, and two meals..and the bill was 32. If that gives you an idea on pricing.
I just realized they opened their other location on McKellips which looks really nice from the outside. It definitely wins more points for outward appearance. But the reviews were iffy regarding poor service..so I'll probably stick with this place.
Ranking close to my top favorite Mexican food in AZ so far. ;)"}
{"text":"Shrimp tacos!  These really are the best I have had.  I have eaten them 3 days in a row before."}
{"text":"There are a few great things about this restaurant, and a few bad things about it. Let's start with the bad:

- service is slow...I kept finding myself thinking \"any day now\" a lot during my visit: for our waitress to come back, to get our food, to get refills and to get our check processed, so beware of the slow service.
- too windy...yes I know we live in a desert and nice, cool air circulation is great n'all; but Rosa's had their A/C a little too cold for how many people were in the restaurant and their fans were spinning at high speeds which was annoying because I always had to wipe that flyaway hair out of my face and I was freezing cold!
- Bean dip...you have to order it...but at other restaurants they give it to you for free, and personally it wasn't worth the money we spent.

Now the good:

- Bathrooms...can I just say: amazing!! It's small, but oh so cute!!! Beautifully decorated, well ventilated and I just LOVE the faucet! Very impressed.
- Food...food was good, I'd say a 5 on a scale of 1 - 10. The food came out at the perfect temperature to just start eating right away - which was good, because I was STARVING. 
- Decorations...this place has the perfect environment for an authentic Mexican meal. Nothing is over done: music, but not too loud; art, and you don't need sun glasses; Lighting, not to dark, not to bright; Bathrooms, again, fabulous...
- Friendly Service...they are slow but when you get the chance to see your waiter, they are nice :)

I recommend this restaurant, it's A-OK!"}
{"text":"Terrific service and very friendly. Took a very obnoxious friend and they handled her brilliantly. Drinks were huge, meal was STELLAR and the place was VERY clean. I will be going back again and again."}
{"text":"Went for Saturday breakfast at 1:20 pm. I am 66 years old and eat alone as I have no family in Arizona, so I always tip at least $5.00 even though my check is usually below $15.00 dollars but I feel it's only fair to the server because I take a table and realize their income is dependent on tips. I ordered a chorizo burrito and coffee. The very nice waiter returned to my table and informed me they were out of coffee. I said you don't have any made or your completely out of coffee? Well they said it takes 25 minutes to brew and didn't want to make it.  I've eaten here before and didn't mind waiting, but they still didn't make it. So I voted with my feet and left. So there goes customer service."}
{"text":"Great food wonderful margaritas   Service is super fast and very personable. Chips and dips to start with and the chips are fresh and warm  great place to bring the family  reasonably priced for the amount of the portions."}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying the mole enchiladas were yummy,  The server was adorable, and the chips were great!

Now the bad: My family is vegetarian with the exception of me.  After constant assurances there was no lard or pork fat in the beans we ordered chips salsa, a veggie burrito and the fish tacos.  Both my wife and daughter (the veggies) became violently ill on the way home.  The server claimed there was only peanut oil in the beans which we believe to be suspect.  In addition, all of their salsas, with the exception of the habanero have chicken stock.

Bottom line: cute place, nice atmosphere, not going back.  Not putting lard in products does not make them vegetarian.  What a rough night."}
{"text":"I was pretty dissappointed with my last visit to this location. The service was really slow and inaccurate (ordered a margerita on the rocks and frozen came). I can't really blame it fully on the waiter, the place was obviously under staffed. 
I ordered a green chilli chimmy with green sauce... and it was not good. The beef was dry and flavorous and the green sauce was bla... I couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Did not care for this place at all. Surprised it had four stars!  Salsa was sweet not spicy, meat smelled weird, beans had odd taste and worst of all we didn't feel well after eating here.  Will not go back!  Would have been better off going to Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my daughter and it was wonderful!  The food was served quickly and it was very large portions.  The flavors were good and the staff was very attentive.  Really great dining experience."}
{"text":"I am from the SF Bay Area, hence, i have lots of excellent choices in CA.  This place is ok.  I probably wont be back although not bad.  I  had the Mexican salad and that was good.  The beef taco was good but nothing special.  I guess that somes up the restaurant good but nothing special.  Chips and salsa ok at best."}
{"text":"This place is below average. I ordered my food to go - Chile Relleno a la carte and a Chicken Chimichanga Plate Enchilada Style. Staff was friendly and my order was done fast, but the food wasn't very good. The Nachos were stale, my Chile Relleno was made with New Mexico Chiles and not the Poblano listed on the menu, lastly my Chimichanga was merely chicken - no sauce or flavor to substantiate the \"enchilada style\" designation.  I've sampled enough of this menu to know that I won't be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Burrito Grande and Horchata. They started us off with a large bowl of complimentary fresh tortilla chips and delicious dips. I'm not from around here but the proportions are amazingly huge; I could not finish my plate. The food is delightfully authentic with a ton of meat in the burrito. And the horchata was very smooth as opposed to the powdery stuff, and in a cup so large that I could barely wrap both hands around the cup. 

Only minor nitpick is that the food was not spicy and neither was the provided hot sauce. But then I don't know what the gauge is for spiciness in this town."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the management team has great customer service! I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best white-people-Mexican-food around LOL!

 The stuffed quesadilla is BOMB. The cheese crisp, yum. Tacos, great. Chimichanga NOT great, it's very very dry. EVERY time I order it, too. Actually most of the shredded beef is dry. 

And the green salsa is sweet! Which, seems to be either a love or hate feeling for most people. I happened to LOVE it. mmm. The beans are cooked with like a smoke flavor so they taste super good. Overall I would recommend Rosa's. It's not SUPER authentic Mexican, though. Just sayin. Kinda Mexican American...Kinda.. But I enjoy the flavors. And you can tell by the almost-strictly white audience that dine in here, its not 100% Mexican flavors, but don't let this comment turn you off. It's still really good, we come here quite often. just know that there are more authentic places

Overall, there's more good food than bad. I would recommend this place (and I do often) to my friends and anyone else."}
{"text":"Outside is questionable but go in!!  Service was great and good was good!  Portions are big and drinks are cold.  I had the chimichanga and could only eat half!  Margarita hit the spot after a long flight!"}
{"text":"Wonderful attentive service from start to finish, came on a weekday wasn't very busy. 
Ordered Mole enchiladas and the green corn tamale with a cheese enchilada it was decent tasted authentic except both plates tasted so smoky! So it all essentially tasted the same smoky flavor even the beans and rice! I think it's fine if just one item had that flavor but It was a little too much. Really nice family restaurant, you can see the attention to detail in the restaurant hacienda design and it has a charming feel. Horchata was good tasted more homemade very rich (leche cream maybe?). Overall good experience but based on food.... leave the smoky flavor to one entree."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident during a business trip. Glad I did. Ordered the mini taco sampler as an appetizer and they were really tasty. Had the seafood enchiladas as my main course and they did not disappoint. Service was very good as well. Somewhat pricey but the food was fresh and plentiful."}
{"text":"Great food. One of Mesa's originals. Staff was very helpful. My wife loves to go next door to get great deals on clothes while I finish up my meal."}
{"text":"This has become a staple for lunch.  We go  about three to six times a month. 

They have a few tasty lunch specials for great prices (try the sweet pork enchilada). The flying saucer--basically a sort of salad with tasty chicken or beef--is one of my favorites.  

Give it a try.  Good food fair price!"}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped at Rosa's for lunch after golf. This is the place we usually frequent when we are in the area. However, I ordered my spinach enchiladas as it is usually good. However this time it was not the same. I brought it to my waiter's attention and asked him if it was a different chef because I have had it before. His immediate response was that is the way we make it all the time. He did not offer to exchange it or if I would want sometime else. His attitude was \" your tough luck\" if you don't like it. He was rude and does not belong in the food service industry. I am surprised that a long time establishment such as Rosa's would have employee that represents them in a negative way.  We have decided to take our business elsewhere next time. Perhaps the management of this location need to be looked at by the owner."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and had excellent service!! Would come back again! The green salsa is so good!"}
{"text":"I keep forgetting about this restaurant because it is so far south of us. We arrived at the restaurant around 6PM and we were the only customers and the staff was outside getting fresh air.

The decor is still the same, not much has been done. The sign outside is a bit faded.
Our server was so-so, all business.

I had the two enchilada combo, One pork and chicken and I substituted the refried beans with black beans with red sauce. It was pretty tasty. Plenty of chicken and pork with each bite. There were more black beans on my plate with a couple of spoon fulls of Spanish rice. The little bit of diced lettuce, tomato and onions was refreshing.

My wife had a different combo, forgot what she ordered which came with the refried beans. Ask her why she didn't get the black beans and her answer was that sometimes the beans aren't thoroughly cooked, Mine were perfect.

This is the place to go if you just want good Mexican food."}
{"text":"We are in Mesa for a month a year and have come to really like Rosas.  We have tried a variety of dishes and all have been excellent.  Especially like their shrimp and fish tacos.  Also, they make great margaritas and they have a great happy hour. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is so good that every time my family flies down from Chicago, we drive an hour just to drive out to Mesa from the west valley just to eat here!!  Everything I've had I've loved!!  And the bathrooms are adorable!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre. Been here 3 times and it's been generic and underwhelming every time. Got the enchiladas with mole sauce and I honestly wish I could go back in time and make a different decision."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is nice, generous portions, authentic Mexican food. We are glad we went here. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Very friendly. Great service. I asked them to make my pork in green chilies spicy and they did it perfectly. Will visit again"}
{"text":"Pretty standard Mexican food. It was good. I was pleased. Can't say I was necessarily impressed. I'm sure we'll be back at some point since they are super close to us. I'll have to update then."}
{"text":"Friend and I had the shredded beef Chimichanga plates with rice and beans.  Very run of the mill Mexican food, not bad, but nothing to get excited about.  The rice is very good and the beans are just so-so.  The guacamole however, is plain awesome!  The beef had little flavor so it was just something to fill up on.  I've definitely had better Mexican food.  The restaurant and our table were very clean and the service was good.  Nice place for a decent meal with no surprises."}
{"text":"This place is ok. I dont think its as good as everyone says it is. Its Americanized Mexican, which is fine but not something that I go for all the time and its definitely not at the top of my suggestion list for Mexican food restaurants."}
{"text":"I don't live in AZ anymore but whenever I visit, a trip to Rosa's is high on the list of priorities. Chips and salsa are always fresh, staff is always friendly, and the food is delicious! 

Take a friend and enjoy a happy hour margarita and a few tacos in this brightly decorated atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Considering I was part of a group that had over 20 people in it, I would say they handled the situation fairly well. Only one plate was given to the wrong person, and one person didn't get silverware. 

The food itself was great, not one complaint about the food. Everyone enjoyed their food, conversation remained lively and all was well with the world."}
{"text":"Rosa's is the only Mexican place I like in the East Valley. They serve baja-style, seemingly authentic Mexican, with fresh ingredients and good service. Don't be put off by the almost-dead, no habla ingles crappy shopping plaza...just park in the ample lot and ignore your surroundings.

I've been there enough to have settled on a favorite dish: the baja shrimp tacos (also available in a tasty grilled fish), which are amazing. The shrimp is always perfect, and it's complemented with a not-too-sweet pineapple salsa and fresh vegetables. I'm not a rice and beans fan, and the staff has always happily substituted black beans and a grilled corn-off-the-cob dish.

I did once have a mistep, which might have been more my taste than the food: I didn't care for the mango chicken salad. The carmelized onions with mango didn't appeal to me, even though separately the ingredients were all fine.

The highlight of Rosa's is the green salsa verde that's served with chips as you wait. They'll also bring a red tomato salsa to your table, but you'll forget about it after you try the green."}
{"text":"No restaurant review should ever have to say, \"Where you start getting into trouble with this place is when the entrees come out.\" But that's exactly the case here. This food is hot garbage wrapped in tortillas. The fish tacos are nauseating. The incredibly dry meat in the green chilli burrito gave my brother in law food poisoning. The beans taste burnt, and they've apparently decided to season their rice with dust. Failing at the basic, I can only imagine the nightmares happening on the deeper items on the menu. Also it's overpriced. The chips and salsa are very good (especially the green salsa), and the staff is very friendly. Those things are important enough to squeeze out two stars. But if you're near downtown Mesa, I don't know why you wouldn't go to Mango's instead."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a local to us as we were in town for a swim meet. We stopped in for lunch and was not disappointed. The steak fajitas were great along with the half pitcher of margarita. The green salsa was different and grew on ya as you kept dipping. 

Atmosphere was great inside, definitely worth returning!"}
{"text":"My wife has this tendency to suggest that I give Mexican restaurants a second chance if I give them a bad review on Yelp.  So, I gave Rosa's another try after panning them in 2013. 

Holy crap, Is this the same place?

Maybe the chef was having a bad day when I was here a few years ago, but now, I would have to say that I'm a big fan of the food here.  The red sauce on that wet burrito was amazing, with a distinct, unique smoky flavor.

Okay, make that jump now from 2 stars to 4.  Definitely a place I'll be returning to when I'm in the neighborhood--maybe the next time my wife and I go to Fallas we'll go here for lunch or dinner afterwards."}
{"text":"Burro supreme is very good. Fantastic flavor on the beef. Wife had a chimi with beef which was different than expected but still pretty good. Beans had great flavor as well. Service was prompt and staff was good.  Overall a great dining experience with great food."}
{"text":"Nice decor, friendly staff and good prices.  I thought the salsa was a little weak, the green tomatillo sauce actually tasted sweet, not spicy.  Portions were enormous.  Great happy hour prices on Margaritas."}
{"text":"We ate at Rosa with friends on a Saturday night. It was pretty empty when we arrived at 5:30, so it was surprising that service was so slow. It took about 20 minutes to be asked about our orders, and we weren't staring at our menus that entire time. They did supply us with large bowls of chips and fresh salsa, so that satiated us in the meantime.

I ordered a fajita salad with steak. It was incredibly good, and HUGE. The steak pieces were abundant and the avocado slices were perfectly ripe. The vinaigrette worked well, too. My margarita, however, can only be described as mediocre. 

My husband had the steak fajitas and found them to be quite good. Large amounts of food for a good price.

Our son ordered the cheese crisp. He didn't like it, but that was because of his own pickiness, not the fault of the crisp. Us adults had pieces and thought it was just fine, and the leftovers came home with us.

Even with the blips in service and the state of the margarita, the food well exceeded my expectations, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I wouldn't mind coming here again."}
{"text":"I love this place, the staff is always friendly and fast. The food is always grease and great I think we go here 3 times a week st least."}
{"text":"Last night we went to Rosa's due to the fact that we were near Mesa and to my surprise it was semi disappointing. We thought since it's a \"hole in the wall\" Mexican restaurant, it would be delicious, but the food was just sub-par.
I ordered the two seafood tacos (shrimp and cod) with a generous side of black beans and Spanish rice. All in all, it satisfied my hunger, but it was much too sweet and kind of bland, due to a lack of salt. The food was also cold by the time it got to us. The best part was the chips and salsa and the black beans. 


We may come back, but so far it wasn't all that impressive."}
{"text":"Some friends introduced my husband and I to Rosa's a while back and it was love at first bite.  I grew up in Arizona so I know the difference between real (at least Arizona real) Mexican food and Chi Chi's.  Anyone here from the east coast who has experienced Chi Chi's?  Chi Chi's is just wrong, in my opinion.
Their green salsa (something you don't see everywhere) rocks and their margaritas are potent.  Whenever you go, try to go during off hours.  Almost every time we have been there we've had to wait for a table.  It's definitely worth it.  And if you have to wait, just ask the bartender for a cold beer.  You don't have to be seated to get great service.  

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and when I'm having a cheat meal then I visit Rosa's.... The 2 cheese enchiladas with beans and rice... Along with a side of chips and green salsa.... YUMMY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I could not recommend this place more. The chicken nachos were amazing and a lot of food even for the half order. My wife got the shrimp tacos (off the chain) I got the chimichanga plate and a tamale(red). Everything was amazing and there was so much food that we had left overs. It was still amazing the second day!"}
{"text":"It's good we had a great service but wasn't the best Mexican food I never had! I am glad I tried it no regrets and hope you enjoy!i had the quesadillas and fajitas with the three meat shrimp,chicken and beef! it was fresh and the place is beautiful I love their selling lamps and decoration and mostly its clean so I will be back when I am hungry in this area! bonne appetit!"}
{"text":"I won't repeat everything that has been said about Rosa's.  They range from \"great food/terrible food; great service/terrible service; authentic/not authentic\" and so on.  No restaurant can please everybody, so I suggest if you like Mexican food you go there and form your own opinion.  Here's mine ...

There is no doubt this restaurant is in an old strip mall in a seedy location.  If that turns you off, perhaps you should find a place in trendy Scottsdale.  In reality the location isn't THAT bad.  If I were to weigh food quality vs location, well I can't because I have eaten in some amazingly filthy dives around the world and as a result have been fortunate to have eaten some of the most incredible foods of my life.

If you can get past the location, the interior is actually quite nice, sort of like a sun splashed courtyard in Jalisco.  The staff is quite friendly and the menu is extensive (and reasonably priced).

I tend toward the Enchiladas de Mariscos, which seem expensive at almost $14 but they are made with REAL seafood, not that fakey stuff most restaurants use.  I'm not sure what magic they use to make these but it is sheer bliss.  I would drive 100 miles to taste this delicious specialty.

In my travels I believe I have had some amazing Mexican food ... in U.S. border towns, in Mexico City, in Baja, in Mexican seashore villages that NO one ever goes to.  Those experiences are the only reason I can't rate Rosa's a 5-star.  But if none of those places I have visited ever existed and Rosa's was one of my final choices I  would rate them as easily in the top 5 in the Southwest USA.  And that's putting Rosa's up to some VERY worthwhile competition!"}
{"text":"Hands down best traditional Mexican food in AZ!  Green salsa and Enchiladas Monterey are amazing!"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover, this place is AMAZING! Whenever I travel to Arizona from Colorado this is ALWAYS a stop for me and my family! 
This is the only restaurant with salsa hot enough for my dad. The fish tacos are outstanding and so refreshing! The sweet corn tamales are what dreams are made of! Do your tastebuds a favor and stop in for fantastically flavorful authentic Mexican cuisine!"}
{"text":"This place is great.   Food is excellent and service and prices are reasonable.   You will be glad you ate here."}
{"text":"Killer Burrito with cheese + watermelon aguas frescas = amazing."}
{"text":"We came here with family after recommendations from friends.  The food was just ok, and seemed a little over-priced for the quality (and it wasn't that expensive).  We drove from Ahwatukee to try this place out and I would never do that again.  If we happened to be in the area and saw the place I \"might' give it another visit, but not really worth a lot of effort."}
{"text":"My brother raves about this place all the time so we decided to take a large party there for dinner. The food took a while to come out and when it did a few of the orders were mixed up. The waiter apologized and did what he could to quickly correct it but it did take some prodding. The food was really good but I actually do like Tia Rosas more. The prices seem to be a little high and the service needs to up its game a bit (if they can't accommodate  larger parties, they just need to be up front). Overall, we didn't mind too much because it gave us time to catch up and the food ended up being good. I think in smaller parties, I'd give rosas a 4 star instead but time will tell."}
{"text":"Sigh... I'm done with Rosa's.  Went there on Thursday and ordered something I am very used to ordering.  It was bland and uninspiring.  The salsas - forget it... you'd be better off smuggling in a bottle of Herdez.  Chips?  Bland and stale.  The waiter was very quick, though - gotta hand it to them on that."}
{"text":"On first look, this place is not in the greatest part of town. However, that's when you know it's gonna be great--and it sure was. We always came here when I was younger, but we came back today--and wow, definitely blown away. The chips were just like any other place--nothing special, but the salsa--amazing. I'm not much of a red salsa fan, but even the red salsa was great. The green was so tasty--we had two cups each. We got the carne asada quesadilla and the sweet pork grande burrito--both were fantastic. It was incredible how good the food was--and the portion sizes were large! It should be not d, the server was great and friendly, too! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A friend who lives nearby brought us here for a late lunch.  I ordered the shrimp tacos with mango salsa. The shrimp were cooked just right and the salsa complemented them with just the right amount of sweet and sour.  The rice and beans were among the best I've had, just a little smoky, which was really tasty.  The chips and salsa came with both red and green salsa.  The green salsa was a sweet salsa, very tasty.  The red salsa could have used a touch more salt, and I would have preferred a little more heat, but it tasted fresh and went well with my meal.  I look forward to visiting again and sampling more menu items."}
{"text":"This is classic Americanized Mexican food... super cheesy, mostly fried, and fully delicious. They start you with chips and 2 salsas - green and red, which are both mild and kind of sweet. Now, if you ask for it, you can get a tasty 'hot' salsa, which I liked much better than either of the original salsas. I had a cheese crisp and beef taquitos. The cheese crisp was more crispy and more cheesy than most.... it was a fabulous thing. The taquitos were fairly average, but also covered in melty cheese... overall, nothing special, but tasty. The husband enjoyed his bean and cheese burrito. The bill was under 20$... can't complain about that!"}
{"text":"Rosa's is awesome.  It flourishes despite its sketchy surroundings.  The location is downright scary from the outside - beaten-down old half-empty strip mall, with a clothing store next door that sells new clothing, but makes a typical thrift store look like Neiman-Marcus.  If you were just driving by, the odds you'd want to stop are near zero.  Don't be deterred!  Once inside, you'll be quite comfortable as the surroundings are nice and comfortable.

I've had several items here, but have settled lately into their fajitas.  I always order a chicken/beef combo, and I swear they simply double the portion of meat by giving full servings of each.  The beef is unusually good for fajita beef, very steak-like and tasty.  Zombie Girl generally goes for the shrimp tacos, which she loves.

Prices are reasonable, service is competent and friendly, and the value proposition is strong.  Rosa's earns a solid 4.5 stars on the patented, trademarked and copyrighted Brak-O-Meter, a half-star withheld for location.. but rounded up to 5 due to all the positives.  Visit Rosa's tonight, you won't be disappointed.  And you know you can always trust Brak!"}
{"text":"OK so the venue is definitely a hidden  gem. I did a to-go order but took a look around and you definitely would feel like you're in a different area...the neighborhood looks kind of shady. Service was great and food portion was decent to above average (lots of meat in my chicken enchilada), prices were very reasonable.  4 stars instead of  5 however because I felt the food was just ok...worth the buy but not anything amazing"}
{"text":"We had a hankering for Mexican on our first night in Mesa. We'd gotten up super early to fly in, gone straight to a ball game, the finally found our hotel and were ready to do some eating.

Rosa's was the perfect choice. Service was way above par and our waiter came by like every 2 minutes to make sure we were doing okay.

I ordered a shredded beef burrito and it was excellent. I wish their sauces had a little bit more of a kick to it, but that's all right.

We ended with the sopapilla's (a closet favorite of mine) and they were superb. I could've eaten them all day."}
{"text":"Rosa's is my new go-to Mexican spot in town. Service was slow (seemingly for all tables) or else I would give it 5 stars. Don't judge a book by its cover (or in this case, it's semi-seedy strip mall location).

Definitely ask for the hot salsa as the other two are sweet as other reviewers have mentioned (we mixed the sweet ones with the hot and enjoyed them all). The horchata was really good (and includes unlimited refills, which I found odd for a horchata... note - more than one will really fill you up). 

Portions were large and tasty and great as leftovers the next day.

If you have enough room left over (or a lot of friends to share with), give the fried ice cream a try (I have been trying to find fried ice cream like this since moving to Phoenix from Denver in 2001!)."}
{"text":"I was craving a shredded beef crispy taco from Mango's last night so I drove 20 minutes out of my way just to arrive and find the place closed early on Monday's. I was super bummed :( So I pulled out my Yelp iPhone app and searched for the closest Mexican place with a decent rating. I pulled up to a super sketchy shopping center and parked in front of a taco stand. I looked at the sign and realized it wasn't Rosa's, so I moved my car closer to the front of Rosa's. I walked in and the place is decorated pretty nicely. Chips and salsa came right away with my drink order. The chips were great: large, warm and crispy. The red salsa, however, left much to be desired. It was ok, but nothing to write home about. The green salsa, was absolutely gross! It was sweet. Sickly sweet. Call me crazy, but I was under the impression that salsa was supposed to be spicy. The sweetness of the green salsa only served to highlight how little spice was in the red salsa. But it was free, included in the meal, so I can't complain too much. I ordered a shredded beef crispy taco plate with rice and beans. Now, I don't eat a lot so the portion size was fine for me, but $8.50 for ONE taco and rice and beans? I think they should give you at least two. But, I suppose that is just the nature of ordering from a sit-down Mexican restaurant as opposed to a taco stand. Anyway, my entree came out quickly and although the menu only states soft taco, they gladly made me a crispy one. It's funny because the entire time I was sitting there munching on my chips, waiting for my taco, I kept thinking that I should have just gone over to the taco stand I initially pulled up to in the same shopping center. I wondered what their tacos were like. As soon as my food came and I took a bite of the taco, those thoughts immediately vanished. The shell was nice and crispy, shoved full of very flavorful shredded beef, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese. I like a litte spice to mine so I added some Cholula and it was right on the money. Onto the side dishes - here, they cancel each other out in my book. To give them credit, I usually do not like spanish/Mexican rice. I never eat it. In fact, I usually order double beans no rice. Their rice, however, was really quite good. It was super moist and flavorful, not dry or rubbery at all. I was really quite surprised at how good the rice was. The beans were also surprising, but not in a good way. They tasted more like bbq beans cooked next to, or in, a smoker. All I could taste was smoke and it was not only overwhelming, but out of place. Refried beans should not taste like pure smoke, just sayin'. All in all, the place was quite good. Service was friendly and attentive. However, I wouldn't drive 20  minutes out of the way to come here, like I would for Mango's."}

{"text":"Pretty impressive! Great food, not too loud, attentive and friendly server, and PLENTY of room for my daughters wheelchair. We left full and happy and will be back for sure. Thank you Rosa's!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant.  Best salsa, especially the green. Staff is very friendly. Don't let the storefront scare you away.  It is in a rundown strip mall but the food is great. The flying saucer is a favorite and the sweet pork taco salad bowl is another go-to entree.  Very reasonable prices for large portions."}
{"text":"Is it cheap?  Yes.  Are the chips fresh, and the salsas free?  Yes and yes.  Is the food delicious?  Yeeeeesssss.

Whenever I'm back in Arizona, I hit up Rosa's for some authentic, Baja deliciousness.  Their Baja platter with fish and shrimp tacos is my go-to staple, but their chimichongas and enchiladas are also great.

(Oh, I also forgot.  Are their beans addictive?  Yes...!)"}
{"text":"Hmmmm, unless a Mexican restaurant is authentic, has killer salsa or guac, or thinks totally outside the box, Tex Mex seems all the same to me. I mean obviously if they hand you a burnt or cold dish you can say it is terrible and if it has killer salsa or guac you can say it is great. Maybe I shouldn't write reviews for these types of restaurants because I just don't get it. I have just never left a Mexican Tex Mex restaurant and said OMG! I love it. However, I  am an \"authentic\" Mexican food lover, innovative Latin Fusion taster, and of course, the worse Salsa and Guac snob in Phx. Sooooo, on that note here goes with my review. They kind of asked for it and tempted me to do it when I read their advertised, \"Best Salsa In Town\" signs.  
    The place is darling. I liked the darling deco, the menu artistically is adorable, the girls bathroom has a pail and water pump for a basin! (Love it) My mom said I have always been fascinated with fancy bathroom decor since I was a little girl growing up in NY and I guess I haven't changed much. lol!
   Food- the chips tasted like a bagged grocery type- and I am not talking one of the better brand types either. The red salsa tasted like ketchup to me. However, I will say I did like the green salsa. Mango or fruit infused maybe? The green was good but I am still not giving it a \"Great\" or \"Best\" in town label. Not even close. Nothing to write home about, just better than the red. I ordered a Shrimp Quesadilla, which again was good but nothing to write home about.
  The service was not very good. It did not stink but it wasn't great either. They were busy due to the convention. I usually reserve judgment on those matters to the  managers for not knowing what is going on around their town and scheduling enough staff. However, the guy was not very friendly serving us. He seemed annoyed with simple requests, and he was very slow.  More help was definitely needed that day. Pet Peeve on service- please clean away empty plates and glasses when you put down new ones. We had tons of dirty dishes and glasses in front of us at an already very crowded table. (Not good)
  Ok, so there is my review. Take it or leave it. I feel this place is nothing to write home about. I am amazed at all the 4 and 5 stars it got from fellow Yelpers. It is cute though with OK food. The prices seem on a high average end. Go on off hours I am guessing for possible better service."}
