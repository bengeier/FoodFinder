{"text":"We stopped by on a whim and really enjoyed it. My Jamaican beef pate was nicely flavored. My husband ordered the jerk chicken. While it had sauce on it, the seasoning was deep into the meat. Highly recommended and hope they're successful."}
{"text":"We have been at Savourez three times since it's opening, and there's still no consistent staff in sight. The menu, however, is now much more informative, and the food is still great. 

The second visit was a bit of a let down. What I though was jerk chicken was actually BBQ chicken. It was served as one piece of grilled chicken thigh/leg covered in a (commercial?) spicy BBQ sauce. Too bad, I was hoping for a marinated, slowly smoked and grilled jerk. The rice and peas had also switched to Haitian-style rice and peas, instead of the previous Jamaican, pink-coloured kidney bean rice.

Upon the third visit, Savourez was seemingly back on track. The rice and peas had returned to its former self, and the curry was a good as ever. We passed on the jerk, though.

They told us there would be brunch on weekends! Something to try!"}
{"text":"Cheap prices, friendly staff and good food sums it up! I took their pulled chicken sandwich and it was amazingly seasoned and very cheap! It seemed like it was a family run business so I really encourage people to check it out since they just newly opened--tastes homemade and light on the wallets--definitely a go to for students!"}
