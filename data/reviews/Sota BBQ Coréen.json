{"text":"If we need to wait long time, I understand them, it's because they are popular. If they get the wrong item, I understand them, no one can be perfect. But WTH is this? After 9, basically everything we order got disappeared?? And how can someone just forget to bring a drink? You only have to put the glasses under the machine and thats it!! Food is fine, seriously I don't really have comment on the food. But the service? Lol WILL NEVER COME BACK ANYMORE, reataurant with the worst serving attitude EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Bustling resto with lots of life. Staff super friendly and service somewhat quick. They forgot alot of the stuff we ordered but the plates kept coming.  The manager was sociable and kind.  The sliced beef was very fatty and hard to chew when cooked. The quality of meat could be better.  The soft drinks were all you can drink and they kept our glasses full :)   I don't know if I would come back but I'd give it one more chance."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but they have the worst service I've ever seen. If you can, go to seoul chako instead."}
{"text":"Here, the service was terrible. Our entrees came around thirty minutes apart and they were all cold. It was debatable whether the food would give us food poisoning or Salmonella but after the meal I was considering I had both. The Crispy beef was black and was probably one of the worst dishes I have ever eaten. The beef ribs were alright and the only thing there that even approached average. At any restaurant these ribs would be the worst thing served but here they were the best while still terrible. We barely had our water refilled the whole night. This restaurant was sickening and gross and should be shut down."}
{"text":"We've been to this one and Seoul Chako (directly across the street) and we much preferred Sota. There were a few items from Chako that I distinctly remember not liking (sushi and meat) because the taste was \"off\" and we didn't even want to finish them (I would give Seoul Chako only 2 stars). But everything here tasted great. While I do think korean BBQ dinner weekend buffets are a bit overpriced by a few bucks, to be fair, you're paying a little more to have the option to eat a variety of dishes instead of just one entree. Be reasonable, people!   Some other notes: -Friday is considered weekend (yes, that means you pay more $, but there are also items exclusively available on weekends only)  -Resist sitting in the two-seater couple booths unless you're dining alone. I don't know how a couple can eat there and manage all the dishes in that small space comfortably! This is probably not negotiable if you show up doing a prime-time busy hour.  -The pictures for the food that needs to be cooked (meat, chicken, veggies) are not correct -- the pictures look like platters, but they are more literally like 1-2 pieces per order. (Strangely, the seafood dishes seemed to have more quantity in an order). As a couple, we had two \"rounds\" of dishes where each round we ordered about half a sheet of paper worth, which was approximately 8-10 dishes.  -There are a few random Chinese/Thai dishes (general Tao chicken, sesame beef, pad Thai) that are quite good and really hits the spot if you just want some asian comfort food. Quantity for these orders were much more (I would estimate to be about 1/4 of a regular order at an actual chinese/Thai restaurant), so don't crazy ordering all of them because you won't be able to finish them!  -Can't speak to the service during a crazy dinner hour (we were there around 5 on a Friday), but service when we went was efficient and attentive. Water glasses were continuously filled before we even emptied them."}
{"text":"Good food, great service.  Restaurant across the street cost more and drinks are not free.  The squid is better here.  You can't beat the price, service and food variety."}
{"text":"J'aime vraiment ce resto comparé à celui d'en face. Honnêtement , côté viande ou légume il n' y a pas grand différence avec Séoul Chako. Mais à sota, les drinks sont gratuits, plus de variété de sushi et de crème glacé et aussi il y a des fried buns ( sont vrm vrm bon ). C'est aussi très propre et les serveurs sont tous amicals."}
{"text":"I went there with friends when the menu was halfprice. We waited outside for 2 hours to get a table, since it was a decent deal.   The service was tremendously slow. Food took an eternity to arrive. We were able to tolerate that, since the restaurant was jam packed with customers lured in by the deal. The intolerable part was that half of the food that we ordered never came to our table. For example, we ordered rice and miso soup more than 3 times, they were never brought to our table during our 3 hour stay. We also ordered drinks several times and even personally asked the waiter for the drinks, and still managed to bring the wrong drinks. The vegetables we ordered were also lost in the abyss.  As for the food, the meats were not fresh, most likely they were frozen. The squid tentacles were super salty. They have less items on the menu than the korean bbq restaurant right across the street (some items like pork belly cost an extra $15 to $20).  Overall a terrible experience. Everything took forever to be brought to our table, even the bill! The manager even got angry at us when we did not leave a 15% tip and started to throw our bills and credit cards on the table. Must avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Korean BBQ and think this was our favorite. Only $27 for all you can eat dinner! We live in NYC, where we def can't get this so cheap. (And the US conversion makes it even cheaper for us)  The meat was all well marinated, included Japanese and chinese food, included ice cream and other yummy deserts. Included soda   I loved that there is a menu with images and you easily write down what you want and hand it to someone to bring to you. No need to keep getting up   The service was a bit slow, but you get what you pay for and we happily waited for things to give our stomach time to digest.  Also didn't have to wait long, it's first come first serve and we might have waited 10 minutes on a Friday night.   Highly recommend and def plan on coming back on our next Montreal trip"}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday for lunch. Reasonable price for an all you can eat. The restaurant wasn't too busy so the service was pretty good and fast, but as the restaurant started to fill, the service got slower. The servers were very welcoming and nice, they made sure everything was good and up to our standards. Good selections to choose from"}
{"text":"If they want to compete with Seoul Chako, they need to lower their prices."}
{"text":"I was nervous coming here after seeing the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's true the service is not friendly and they leave you on your own to figure out what to do. BUT the food was delicious, cheap and efficiently delivered. After being told that the wait at Seoul Chako was an hour for a late Sunday lunch, we decided to venture all 10 steps across the street. We were seated right away and yep, left to our own. Using our tourist smarts, we flipped through the menu and filled out the order sheet. Now, this place is busy, so the servers don't have time to come ask you how you're doing etc etc...you have to flag them down. We waved our order sheet around and BAM, 10 minutes later our stack of meat was dropped off at our table.  The food itself was actually really good - the meats were marinated and flavorful. My favorite dish was the bone broth. And they even had sushi and dessert! For $16 a person AYCE, it was a steal.  I don't think the servers mean to be rude - they're just rushing around, delivering new plates of food, cleaning up the ones you polished off and putting on new grills. They did mix up my order once..or twice..but oh well, it wasn't like I was paying extra for it. I left Montreal happy, full and wishing we had one of these in the States."}
{"text":"Je ne vois pas la difference avec Seoul Chako (qui est d'ailleurs just en face). Mêmes prix, même nourriture, même genre de serveurs sans émotions (et surment le même proprio). Le plus ici est que la boisson est à volonté. 16$ au lieu de 30$ avant 15h (je crois). La musique kpop donne une ambiance assez cool. Ils incluent direct le pourboire de 15% comme Chako en face."}
{"text":"Came here because the wait in front was longer. For an all you can eat bbq, for this price, the quality of the food is pretty high. The meat tasted fresh and were well marinated. The sushi were ok, but what can you expect from an all you can eat? They also have soft drinks included in the menu.   It's a great place if you're really hungry and to chill with friends. With tax and tips it costs around 36$ on a weekend evening."}
{"text":"We arrived a Saturday afternoon for their 50% off promotion. Things didn't start too well, as we were seated in front of a dirty, blackened grill which was thankfully promptly changed afterwards.  Wanting to try a little bit of everything, we proceeded to order different items from all parts of the menu. The order included meat, sushi, salad, soups, soft drinks, skewers and fried tempura items.  The sushi and meat arrived reasonably quickly; the flavor was quite nice and the sauces complemented the meat really well.  This is where the debacle begins. After waiting over 30 minutes, we still had not received ANY other items, including soft drinks. We asked a waiter and he told us to simply reorder everything, which we did.  Once again, we never got anything else except meat and sushis, so we asked the waiter personally if he could bring us the soft drinks. However, even though he wrote them down on a paper himself, he still managed to forget one of our drinks.  90 minutes into our visit and after two more orders of meat, some of the soups and tempura veggies we had ordered finally arrived, but we still hadn't received the skewers, the sushi pizza, and the salads. To finish our meal, we decided to simply order more regular sushi. Thirty minutes later, when a manager came over to tell us that this was the last call to order food, we told him we were still waiting on sushi and that we were only planning to order ice cream afterwards. 10 minutes later, surprise!! : the items we had ordered 2 hours ago miraculously arrived (the miso soup, however, seemed to be forever lost in the abyss).  The ice cream, and then the bill, also took forever to arrive. When a waiter received our ice cream order, we specifically asked if it was possible to have each order in a separated bowl. He then came back with 5 bowls each containing a different kind of ice cream, which we were fine with. We asked for extra bowls to split the ice cream amongst us.  A waiter asked us if we wanted separate bills. We said yes and waited a whole ten minutes. Needless to say, he did not get back to us. We then asked a manager if it was possible to have the bills. He said he would take care of it. Another ten minutes later, he came back and asked us if we got the bills to which we said no. He, once again, said he would take care of it and disappeared for another ten minutes. When he came back he told us there was a system error and told us how much to pay. The total was a little less than 10 dollars. Each of us paid with 20 and asked for 10 dollars back. Obviously, the manager did not appreciate it. He asked us why we did not want to leave some tip to the waiters. We nicely explained that we did not receive decent service during our stay today. He responded furiously, saying the waiters are working their ass off, saying we made a mess while eating(we always stacked the plates in between orders and made things a bit easier for them while waiting) and saying how insulting it is. Again, we told him that we understood but we did not get decent service. Then, he threw the money and the cards he was holding in his hands on the table, turned to another waiter and said in Cantonese(we spoke in English this whole time): \"take care of this. I'm getting the f*** out.\"   He added that \"it (the service) is always like this\", so I'm pretty sure I'll never be coming back here again. Wait 3 hours just to get yelled at by the manager? No thanks!"}
{"text":"The food was truly outstanding. I did read the reviews and even though not many were great I still took a leap of faith!   The portions were perfect. I was able to take my time cooking and not feel like it I ordered too much variety I would be over stuffed.   The staff was friendly and attentive.   The selection is good. There is a little of everything for everyone. I enjoy that we can also order sushi at the same time as BBQ!   Over all - I will return when I am back in Montreal!   I wish I had taken more pictures but this is all I have! :)"}
{"text":"Reviews on bad service seem to have got to them- I went with my family earlier this month and was greeted with amazing food and service. Everything was very prompt and servers were attentive and friendly. Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"My frd and I came here for dinner and it was great. At first, we were hesitating because of the reviews. The buffet was really nice for that price. The sushi was not that good but not that bad either. Moreover ,the staff wasn't that great. However, we were there to eat not to have a conversation with the staff so it was fine for us."}
{"text":"The staff's attitude was so bad. This is all-u-can-eat but the staff didn't want us order again because she thought we eat too much......We just ordered normal food for four people. It just were two thin pieces meat on one plate."}
{"text":"It was a great experience. I read the reviews pre going there and lowered my expectations as other people mentioned  The place is very very busy that's for sure but all the servers were easily stoppable to either take my order or help me out with whatever was needed. There are enough servers running around that anytime you looked up there was someone there to help Actually one of the servers noticed from across the restaurant that one of my chopsticks fell on the floor so within seconds I found a server with a new set standing by the table before I even stopped any or asked for any, which I totally appreciated.  The food was great, the portions were a lil small but that's another great thing about all you can eat, it's the fact that you can keep ordering if you want more.  It was def a good experience. Basic instructions: look at the menu, wrote your order on the sheet provided and then give it to a server. It's pretty basic but very good. Great food, good timing, nothing took too long."}
{"text":"Petit restaurant. La bouffe est bonne mais vous devez être habitué a ce type de restaurant car le service est exécrable.   Si vous connaissez pas le concept, le menu; vous sentez que vous dérangez.   La bouffe arrive rapidement même en période de rush."}
{"text":"Une honte pour la cuisine Japonaise et Coréen très mauvaise expérience  vous pouvez voir la saleté sur les pinces pour prendre la viande les deux pinces que nous avions étaient très sales. La qualité de la viande de boeuf est vraiment médiocre avec plein de nerfs. Les kamikaze que j'ai commandé avait du saumon sur la photo un cube au centre quoi, mais quand je vois le plateau qui arrive, des sushis au riz et concombre avec du goberge enduit d'un coulis de sauce teriyaki...aucun saumon? Je demande au serveur (gérant) pourquoi il n'y à pas de saumon dans les sushis c'est normal?  il me dit ( il est là en dessous de la sauce) je regarde une dernière fois pour être sur, non toujours rien ma copine ne voit rien elle aussi et on ce regarde l'air embêté avec un ptit sourire en coin.  alors, juste au moment ou je me questionne sur ma vue il me répond (c'est un sushis à volonté qu'est-ce que tu espère!  Je fais moi même des sushis à la maison et je suis amateur de saumon cru apprêter de plusieurs façons si j'ai pas de saumon dans les sushis que j'ai commandé je risque d'être déçu, surtout si la photo le montre clairement. Je dit au serveur (gérant) que je ne mangerait pas ces sushis là, ce n'est pas les mêmes que sur la photo alors il me dit ( vous les avez commandé il faut payé pour ça!) Il est très agressif et donne une mauvaise image à sont propre restaurent alors je lui dit : ok, écoute ma copine à manger deux morceaux et ne les à pas trouvé bon en plus qu'il manquait le saumon je te paye un repas soit disant 25$ pour deux morceaux de sushis et deux verre d'eau et je pars manger ailleurs merci bonsoir! Je me fou du 25$ je veux juste partir de cette place d'attrape touristes. Mais non il voulait que je paye la totalité quand je n'avait rien mangé des plateaux que lui même avait apporté, il avait bien vu que je n'avait rien touché, j'étais pas contant il n'y avait pas saumon je voulais pas manger.  Bref Il a fini pas accepter les 25$ et je suis partie . Quel histoire quand même pour une soiré en tête à tête...ma soirée à quand même bien terminer, on est aller au SUSHI CRESCENT qui est juste à côté ou j'ai eu un excellent repas et service."}
{"text":"This was probably on of the best place we came across while visiting Québec, MT.   My friends and I drove into Montreal from New York for the weekend and hopped around some decent restaurants. We checked out of our hotel Sunday at noon and headed out to grab a quick bite before the long drive back home. After checking out some spots which didn't seem pleasing around Shaughnessy Village, we made a wrong turn and ended up at the right place.. Sota BBQ & Coréen!  The staff was beyond great. David was very nice, he stepped out of the restaurant and walked down the block with me to make sure that our parking meter was paid for correctly. In all my life experience in dining that was a first, so thank you David. I return back to my table, sat down and we settled for the all you can eat BBQ lunch. We were shocked at how well priced it was and assumed the quality of the food was poor. Oh were we wrong! The steaks and sushi were so delicious. We cooked the steaks on the table to our liking and they were marinated perfectly. The service and the quality of the food was surprising - Great job staff.   Will definitely be coming back to this eatery next time I'm around town and sharing the experience with my family and colleagues."}
{"text":"Food and sushis ok, free soft drinks is a plus.  larger choice then Seoul Chako accross the street, i prefer Sota.  The only negative point is the sitting space is so tight, the owner wanted to squeeze in to maximized the place...."}
{"text":"C'est ordinaire comme service  Le grand monsieur à la chemise était très bête et nonchalant.  La bouffe est ok. C'est un \" all You can eat \".  En plus, on a pas eu ce qu'on a demandé. Au lieu de nous avertir, ils nous ont laissé poireauter pendant 20 minutes.  Je n'y retournerais pas!!!  Ah! La cerise sur le sundae. On a tipé 5% pour le piètre service et le gros monsieur nous a insulté en sa langue!    N'y allez pas!!!"}
{"text":"I think this place was pretty cool. It's about ordering as much meat in small containers or veggies and you can order as many times as you want. They have a little piece of paper and pencil for you to write what you want. One thing I do like is that they also have a cute sushi section to choose from. Honestly it's a nice place. The issue is the meat is good but it's not the best sushi? But I understand that it is korean BBQ. I just think the service was also meh? They were good but I had to ask for my own water so it was alright. I got red bean and green tea ice cream, but the green tea was a little over bearing. The red bean was good though. I have to say it was overall a good visit. I would come again, hopefully there's better service next time"}
{"text":"This would have been a four stars if the server didnt make 3 mistakes and if they were a bit more communicative.   My girlfriend and I went for a long anticipated lunch binge. We were so excited that we ordered so much meats and food. That food stayed on our bellies until supper time. It was totally worth it.   About the place, you wont miss a place to sit because they have a place at the main floor and the basement. The paper was taken right away after we finished to write on it. That was a great plus.   When we got our orders, they gave us potato soup instead of the beef broth one. I thought it was the beef one so I drank it. After we got our main orders, the beef soup arrived. I drank it anyways, it was an honest mistake. Afterward, we didnt order chicken sticks, they gave us some. The third one, we didnt receive our spicy saussages. We were a little disappointed at the service...   For the ones who are allergic or dislike certain things on the menu, be prepare To look at the food more closely in order To avoid nasty surprises!  Overall, it is a good and inexpensive place to nourish your cravings of awesome food in one place. Be a little prepare to have your orders mess up from times to times. Life can be a box of chocolates when you let it."}
{"text":"Food came quickly, tastes good, nice variety, free refills on soft drinks, servers were nice. They don't take credit but they have an atm machine available at the restaurant."}
{"text":"We are a fan of seoul chako and wanted to give this place a try. We went there for luch.  They offered us a table of two by the door but the table was really small and it was windy and there were some bigger tables (4 people)  availabe, we asked them to switch and they refused!  Some couple came after us and they gave them the bigger tables, so we asked them again but again they refused! Anyway, the tables remained empty untill we left and we sat there uncomfortable and disappointed. I checked their menu online before going to the restaurant and there were a lot more options than the menu they gave us. An extra charge of 8.99$ for mushrooms??! The meet had a loooot of fat on it, I don't know how to explain A LOT! Sushi, very average. I payed with card and I was going to pay the tip by cash, when the waitress saw the bill she gave us a look and said you didn't pay tip!!  Overall: I don't recommend this place, if you want to try korean grill, seoul chako accross the street is a way better option."}
{"text":"I went to their opening and they had limited options at the moment. They basically have the same offerings as Chako across the street but they have lots of sauces. Classic Korean BBQ. Since it is their soft opening,  they do not serve alcohol yet. I feel that they have areas to improve on so I would come again after its fully established."}
{"text":"A very average all you can eat self grill combining sushi place. The beef is the best because it was marinated very well. The squid is also a good choice. For the other food, this place is very average while there are many other places to choose from.   The service was very good last time I was there. The soft drinks were always refilled. The empty plates were collected very often. All the staff were very attending.   This is a recently opened restaurant.  people gave one star review when they were here during the half price promotion. Since the place was just testing the water at that time, the review should be more tolerant and friendly. Thank god I wasn't here waiting two hours to suffer the promotion and probably that's why you guys left the worst review and I can't share the feeling."}
{"text":"No go kbbq. Better go to seoul chako then this one.  We went here for the first time. It was dinner moment. 31$ after tax.   When you look on their door. You can see lot of things on the menu. But once you look at the menu. Few of good choice are not for free. 3,99$ for laitue. 8,99$ for some mushrooms.  When you look at the meat. It's not properly cut. You still can see some extra fat or other white stuff on the meat.  When you pay for the bill. I gave to the waitress 40$ for the change back then for the tip. But she gave to me a mad look and said: do you want the change back? I think she think I will give to her 9$ tips or what?   Not Recommended."}
{"text":"Horrible service, dirty environment, food was not fresh at all.   So bad experience ever.... I would never go back"}
{"text":"Went there with some friends for their 50% off deal. Food was quite nice, meats were well seasoned, but the soup was cold and the octopi were too salty. The main problem we had with the restaurant was that service was way too slow, but it may be understandable since the restaurant was really busy. What I don't understand is that half of our food did not arrive until we asked for our bills (3 hours later). We asked for soft drinks 3 times before getting them, and even when we got them, we were still missing a few drinks. We asked for the grill to be changes and it took at least 20 minutes, which is way too slow. When we decided to leave, we were not full, we were just tired of waiting, and asked for our bill. It took more than 45 minutes to get the bill. I had to leave since I had an appointment, and let my friends settle the bill. They then told me later that they did not want to give much tips, and when the manager knew that, he started trash talking to them in chinese, and threw they credit cards on the table in a very direspectful way. If it was not for that, I would have given the restaurant a 2 star, but I believe that disrespecting customers is simply unprofessional and should never happen in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Nouvellement ouvert, ce restaurant n'a rien à envier au compétiteur en face. Il est grand avec des places de disponible au sous-sol.  La nourriture est fraiche et gouteuse. Je crois même mieux que le restaurant en face. Le menu extra du week-end vaut la peine: la viande est beaucoup plus tendre.  Le jus ou la liqueur est gratuite! Thumbs up! Le service est un peu lent, je suppose qu'ils sont dans leur rodage. Je reviendrai certainement pour réessayer."}
{"text":"It's really getting better and better each day. Marination of their meat is on point and not too sweet. Fantastic price"}
{"text":"Horrible service and food quality. Try another korean bb restaurant right across the street. Server threw a wasabi plate and check when he served and the pork i ordered was three pieces of bacon. And had to pay 85 ca dollar. Rude people trash food."}
{"text":"Cool concept with decent price (I went for lunch during the week - 16$), but the food was not all that tasty and the staff wasnt welcoming"}
{"text":"Restaurant de type manger autant que vous le désirez avec un BBq au centre de la table.  La nourriture est vraiment bonne et la variété des plats est très grandes. Ayant et au kalbi avant, j'ai préféré ici puisque j'ai plus de choix que j'aime et il y a des sauces et épices de diverses saveurs.  Par contre, il me prenne que l'argent comptant, pas crédit ni interact.  Je vous conseil une place près de l'allée, le service est meilleur surtout pour le remplacement des plaques de cuisson.  Point faible, il manque souvent des choses commandé lorsqu'on les reçois ou ce ne sont pas les bonnes choses. Nous avons meme eu une commande entière que nous n'avons pas reçu, ils ont même pensé que nous avions terminé.  Très bruyant tout se même et malgré l'absence de ventilateur, la place n'est pas enfumé mais il fait très chaud."}
{"text":"Cela fait maintenant plusieurs fois que j'y vais, et je n'ai rien a redire: le service est rapide, les plats sont absolument délicieux."}
