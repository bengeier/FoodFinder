{"text":"Just ate at Vivo for lunch today and it was wonderful!! We ordered a ceasar salad and a margherita pizza. Both were incredible!! The pizza crust was so tasty and cooked to perfection, and the cheese was absolutely delicious!  The atmosphere of Vivo is really cool and it has an awesome vibe. The decor is hip and fun too.  We were lucky enough to meet the owner, Mike. What a gem!"}
{"text":"Came here with my mom and sister on Eater Monday, saw it was an Italian restaurant and thought why not. We were pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food was, i ordered the pasta with rapini and chilli flakes, my sister ordered the fettuccine Alfredo& my mom the salcica pizza. Both pasta tasted so authentic and the Alfredo sauce was delicious. We've been to quite a few Italian restaurants and were also Italian so it was nice to have authentic tasting food.  The service was also very good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i went here last night. the restaurant is dark romantic and the decor is amazing. There are photographs of the owners and chefs family on the walls.... its cute. My boyfriend called ahead and told them i was vegetarian and the chef prepared a couple of things for me.  There is no set menu and the waitress reads out what the chef has prepared for the night there are 5 courses. an appetizer, pasta, main course, a salad and and dessert. I thought the salad after the entree was pretty interesting . They are also very generous with the bread which i LOVED!!!! Every meal was made to perfection. It had a homey feeling ..... My boyfriend had some scallops that he is still talking about.  My entree was spaghetti squash with mushroom wild rice and berries and limed artichokes. There were soo many flavors and all the ingredients were balanced. The service was great.  All in all it was an amazing experience. The chef came out to say hi at the end of the night...... i finished off my dinner with the creme brulee and some coffee. Our bill came to $120 with tip and it was absolutely worth it . This is a great restaurant for a super special occasions and  it is very private.Not to dressy and not too casual.  Pick out a great bottle of wine or two and get ready to get your taste buds blown.  Im pretty sure my boyfriend and i will be going back."}
{"text":"We have a regular weekly lunch at Vivo. The service is fantastic and the food is amazing! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Looks delicious -- but staff hygiene is gross! Waiter fixed a table leg from rocking then cut lemons, the chef is sweating and wiping his hands on his apron."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and really enjoyed the food. I believe I ordered pasta the first time - no complaints but maybe not the most memorable. I came here for lunch with a coworker and we both got pizza. I loved the one I got - N'duga. Dough was thin and crispy, sauce and cheese was tasty and the sausage was flavourful and spicy, just the way I like my pizza. We also didn't feel like total crap after eating which was great. The only thing I didn't like was the rosemary garnish and would ask to have it left off for next time."}
{"text":"Vivo is not you typical Italian restaurant where you go and sit and eat for hours.  Its not quite fancy and its not quite a dive.  I like to call it an Italian diner 5 start restaurant food but not quite 5 star ambiance.  I give 5 starts to the food, service and the whole Vivo concept.  Menu it not too large but covers all your Italian needs.  Every section on the menu is the same price.  Example all Apps are the same price, all pastas are the same price etc...  I was looking for a good Sunday lunch but wasn't willing to get all dressed up an wanted to be super casual.  Vivo is super casual but with top notch real authentic Italian food.  We ordered the fried Calamari and Shrimp to start they were cooked perfectly taste was there we all know fried fish kind of always tastes the same lol.  I then had a pate of Penne a la Vodka.  Sauce was amazing penne were cooked eldente, just the right amount of pancetta.  Portion was also perfect.  Whats an Italian meal with out having a piece of tiramisu and a coffee.  Tiramisu was very good.  All and all this felt like a typical Sunday Italian family lunch.  There are still many items to be tried on the menu so Vivo here i come lol."}
{"text":"I ate here with my husband and toddler tonight and we were very pleasantly surprised. We shared the insalata caprese, patata pizza, and gnocchi bolognese. The caprese was very fresh tasting, and the gnocchi was a good texture with a tasty bolognese. The pizza was amazing! The flavours went together really well amd the crust was thin and crispy yet also fluffy. And the bonus was that my toddler ate a bit of everything and liked it! Definitely going to keep coming back here."}
{"text":"Decent margherita, bit saltier than I prefer. Nice addition to Etobicoke/North Queen. At $15 it's a bit pricey, $11-12 be nice..."}
{"text":"Great place for a meal!!. I'm still savoring my pizza that I ordered for tonight's dinner. This is my second review about my wonderful experience at Vivo. When we're nearby the area THIS is the place to go for pizza, pasta and anything else. We had the Tagliere Di Salumi as an appetizer. Then we ordered two pizzas that we shared. My better half had Capricciosa pizza and I ordered the special pizza. Wow oh wow .. three ingredients that I love and they put it on a pizza ( mortadella, bufala cheese and pistachio). A glass of wine and illy espresso to end the meal. Always a pleasurable  experience . Thank you staff at Vivo"}
{"text":"I decided to order the salami pizza for takeout one evening. It was a very tasty pizza; thin crust, flavorful dough and toppings but they were stingy on the cheese and meat. Just six little pieces of salami and a few dollops of flor di latte. It was almost like the pizza was meant to be an appetizer for two to share. I would only buy it again if it was about $5 but I'm not paying $15 + tax for that."}
{"text":"I'd liken this place to a West-end Marcello's!    I've been looking for an affordable Italian place and just ended up at bakeries - which is fine, but sometimes I just want a nicer atmosphere and this had it.  Location:  Across the road from Sherway Gardens, past Walmart/Winners, sharing the same parking lot as Marshall's, tucked behind Nando's.  Area is primarily Commercial, some Industrial, mainly for shopping.  Prices:  In comparison to other Italian restaurants, Vivo offers blanket pricing so all Apps - $11, Pizzas/Pastas - $15, Desserts - $6.  There are also Daily Specials - $23.    Pastas at other joints can easily be $20+!  Why?  It boggles my mind.  Portions:  GOOD.  You will have leftovers.  I probably ate 1/2 of the portion of gnocchi - and that was shared.  We packed up a coupla slices of pizza.  Food:  We ordered Gnocchi with Bolognese sauce (meat) and Primavera Pizza.  Server suggested the Bolognese as opposed to the Pomodoro.  Gnocchi were nice and soft.  Pizza was thin, not too crispy, still soft.  Between the 2 dishes, we preferred the pasta.  What I noticed was that the food was just a bit under-seasoned.  So don't expect your tastebuds to go off immediately!  The flavour is there, but if you're used to lotsa salt OR dine out a lot, it may come off as bland.  Great option if you're near Sherway and don't feel like any mall food!"}
{"text":"A delighted surprise! To be honest, I walked into this place knowing it was a franchise restaurant. This place exceeded my expectations! Food was fast and service was efficient. The restaurant feels modern vs. upscale dining, but food was up to par.   We ordered a pizza and pasta both priced at $15 each. You could also explore their daily special priced at $23. At this price point, you would be expecting a Scaddabush setting which is kind of a miss, but I promise, their food makes up for it.   We ordered the prosciutto pizza and the spaghetti agile e olio. The cooked pizza dough was delicious and extremely tasty. The Spaghetti was not spicy and noodles were made to al dente. We had a great meal!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite 'event' restaurant (by which I mean, spendy, but definitely worth it for special occasions).  It is great for intimate birthdays, celebrations, etc.  Whatever karmic intervention gave the 'Bustling Borough of Bellevue' this restaurant makes me think we, as a community, has done something right.   But more importantly the food...  Oh, the food!  The owner/chef takes so much care, it makes the whole experience very enjoyable.  I have never had a bad meal.    I"}
{"text":"Newly opened in the Etobicoke area. Not far from Sherway Gardens! Came for an early dinner and it was quiet. Our server/owner was very chatty, gave us great recommendations and description of portion size as we were asking him how much we should order for a party of 4.   What I ordered: Gnocchi  Carbonara Prosciutto pizza Daily special pasta  We ended up ordering four dishes to share. And the carbonara was hands down everyone's favourite! But the portion sizes were relatively small. I feel like if we came in with an empty stomach, it wouldnt be enough. Would keep this place in mind when im in the area for dinner!"}
{"text":"Yes!!!!!!     Great service! Great Food! Love the BYOB!!! ($5)."}
{"text":"I went to VIVO on a whim while searching for a good BYOB to celebrate a special occasion with my other half.  I was skeptical as I had never been to Bellvue before and knew there was not much there.  I was pleasantly surprised with VIVO's atmosphere.  In the heart of this small neighborhood, I found a fabulous, european like restaurant that tickled my taste pallette.  The menu is entirely verbal and progressive meaning your entree order is not taken until you are finished with your appetizer.  Something I had come to know and love when studying abroad in Italy.  After a lengthy meal of beyond exceptional food, the Chef/Owner visited our table (and everyone elses) to ensure satisfaction and talk to us about our lives and the life of VIVO!  He was sincere, personable and a real treat to the already amazing food!  This place is worth every penny!!! Viva la VIVO!!!"}
