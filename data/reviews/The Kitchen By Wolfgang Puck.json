{"text":"Traveling solo so I was seated at the bar.  Two bartenders on shift, was at least 10 minutes before they acknowledged my presence.  Beer taps not working, so I ordered a Coors Banquet which came in a stubby bottle.   Ordered the WP burger with the standard chips, fries were an upgrade.   Burger tasted good, patty was a little on the small side.  Certainly nothing special for $18 CDN.   Will likely just grab something from Spolumbos or BK next time."}
{"text":"As far as airport food this place is excellent. I had a chopped salad with salmon. Everything was fresh and well prepared. Service was a little slow. If you have a flight to catch be sure and tell your server."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with lots of tv, the bartenders will change the TV's to whatever you want. Great selection of beers on tap from your regular budwesier to local brewhouses like Wild Rose. Service is attentive but not intruding. Typical expensive airport prices, a pint is $13."}
{"text":"Best grilled chicken sandwich I've ever had! The French fries were thin and crispy and yummy as well. The meal was topped off by a gregarious and friendly Karen who obviously enjoyed her job. A nice way to round out my trip out of Calgary, keep up the great work everyone!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast.  WP restaurants are usually great. Not this one.  The waitress was rude - from beginning to end.  When she walked up she said \" How are you ?\" my husband replied. I was looking down - putting away our passports. She looked at me and very rudely said \" I said how are you ?! \"   My eggs were awful. Not real eggs from a jug.  My husband ordered fried - those were real.   Then we watched them drop eggs on the floor and pick up the ones that did not break and cook with them. He used the same gloves to cook as he just cleaned the floor with - not cool.   Horrible service here at this location."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat at the Calgary International Airport! What a gem!   Inside the brand new International Terminal, The Kitchen is Wolfgang Puck's newest culinary adventure - and one not to be missed if you're nearby!  The interior of the restaurant is comfortable and clean modern lines with just enough rustic stone, mood lighting and linens to make it homey. The menu is varied through homestyle Americana comfort food with everything from Mac & Cheese to Sandwiches and Pizza.   But the real star of the show on our visit was the Chicken Milanese! Oooh! Do I have dreams of this perfectly breaded poultry cutlet goodness! Truly, it's the best one I've had in years! It's simply stated and not overdone plated next to a small green arugula salad. The breading texture is light and airy while still savory and satisfying. The cutlet is thin, tender and moist - perfect! Just the welcome addition of fresh lemon and some stone ground mustard is all that is needed.   The Chicken Milanese cutlet with lemon and stone ground mustard versus the arugula salad with cherry tomatoes is the perfect balance of sweet: savory: tangy.  My husband ordered the Fennel Sausage pizza with feta. He enjoyed it but I was too obsessively immersed in the Chicken Milanese to pay his dish much attention.  We visited The Kitchen just a few days after the Grand Opening and were pleasantly surprised. Typically newer restaurants are a little rusty and take time to smooth out the edges, understandably. However the staff we encountered on our visit were experienced, knowledgeable about food and wine pairings, attentive and efficient. Which is awesome when you want a nice meal but need it to be within your time schedule at the airport.   Really, I can't say enough good about this place. My only complaint is that there isn't one in Seattle yet..."}
{"text":"We had time to kill and somehow this restaurant managed to do just that, but in a negative way. I got my water refilled once and just getting my drink to start with took over half an hour. I got asked if I wanted more water when my food finally arrived after an hour later... I figured that was a given. The food was okay, I'd recommend going somewhere else to sit down and eat. This one was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Fewer than 10 people at 5:15am, I ordered french toast. It was served lukewarm (I think the server didn't notice it was ready) and the syrup was actually cold (it came in a little plastic cup and I think the syrup canister was stored in a fridge). Intriguingly, the butter was in small canisters that seemed to be room temperature. I'm giving them 2-stars instead of 1 because it was plated nicely with chilled whipped cream and a few berries. And aside from the non-heated state of the food, it was bland.  In other words, avoid this place (at least the food)."}
{"text":"International travel is always tough to plan ahead for... sometimes  you breeze through security with plenty of time and other times it takes hours and you just barely make your flight... Luckily for me and my husband, security and customs were a breeze on a recent trip heading back to Phoenix from Calgary, so we had some time to hang at the YYC airport before boarding our flight.  I've flown out of YYC before, but I'm pretty sure they added some new retail and restaurants since my last visit, as there are now plenty of options if you have time to browse or $$ to spend.  We wandered over to TKBWP and were greeted promptly by a manager and seated within minutes in a comfy booth in the back.  Rahul was our server and he was super friendly and knowledgeable.  I was very pleasantly surprised by this as you don't often find this level of service at airport establishments.  The menu is solid and after some back and forth, we decided to order a hummus and quinoa wrap and an order of avocado toast... for sides we went with a mixed green salad and chips and shared.  The food was very good.  We enjoyed the wrap better than the avocado toast, but we cleaned both plates and lingered a little since we had time!  I'd happily return to The Kitchen on future trips and recommend you do the same.  You may even want to request Rahul's section... enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant in the Calgary Airport.  Friendly staff and convenient plug ins for technology.  Inhad the pizza margherita and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Located in the new concourse E, this place has great ambiance and lots of seating. Looks like they should have good food but it was disappointing that they were not able to meet that standard. The food was ok the price is steep and the setting is awesome."}
{"text":"Writing this review from the perspective and expectation of airport food, we stopped in for breakfast before flying out to the US, it was busy for breakfast but our servers were friendly and prompt. Grabbed coffees and the basic breakfast of eggs, toast, bacon and hashbrowns. The smashed potato hasbrowns were quite tasty, the rest of the breakfast was quite standard but no complaints."}
{"text":"Got a voucher for a delayed flight so I decided to grab a quick snack. Ordered a hazelnut latte and salted caramel pudding. Both were delicious and complimented each other well. The staff was very nice and engaging. Next time I'm in Calgary I'll definitely order more as their main menu looked very diverse and the food smelt great."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful! They are still getting their legs under them where they are new, but a nice solid addition for an airport.  We stopped for breakfast and ordered at the window & then found out that was the Express, when we wanted to sit at a table, but they were kind and seated us. The breakfast potatoes are the best I have ever had: tiny steamed potatoes with herbs pan fried. My BFF had a Hummus Wrap that included Tahini, Tomato Vinaigrette, Argula, Black Olives, Cucumbers, etc. It had an amazing flavor. My guy and I had a traditional breakfast with The Potatoes and Smokehouse Bacon. Very satisfying. They also had fresh squeezed Orange Juice, which I love! The service was very good."}
{"text":"Sadly the usual crappy airport food. Oatmeal has milk and sugar already mixed in. Avocado toast covered in oil and the avocado is more of a squeeze paste / guacamole on toast than the vegetable itself and the scrambled eggs are just disgusting whatever they're made of."}
{"text":"I wish this restaurant was in every airport I visit. We all know that airport restaurants often suck. This one doesn't! The chicken burger was delicious! I'd purchase it outside of an airport. I don't know the last time I thought that about a meal I bought in an airport. My husband's chicken wrap was good.  The chips and fries good.   The waiter was very mediocre - he whispered and we could barely hear him in the quiet restaurant, but that's ok, because the food was good!  Since we go through Calgary regularly, this is our absolute must-go-to from now on."}
{"text":"I like Wolfgang Puck eateries but I was really disappointed by the kitchen. The waitress who sat me was rude and kept rolling her eyes. This place is much to nice for this. I ordered my eggs with cheese from the bartender and it was not add. Not a big deal but when I asked for more cheese the waitress was weird about it. She did take my plate back and then just sprinkled cheese on top. The bartender, Quinn, was so nice though (he is the only reason for the second star) he saw my plate and took it away immediately to fix it. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"For what this place is (airport restaurant), they crush it. Fast and friendly service with good food"}
{"text":"Wish there were 4.5 star rating to give, as the service was neither friendly nor attentive, but rather, fine to good.  But...the Crispy Chicken is absolutely incredible!  Flavorful, tender, juicy, just a little dip in that mustard sauce and whoa...it's the kind of bite thar makes my mom release embarrassing noises in public.  Impeccably spotless, impressive decor, amazing food.    Try this if you're in the Calgary airport or not!"}
{"text":"Around lunch time and we had lots of time before our flight. One of the better options available for lunch. Like many airport restaurants, I had no high expectations. The only expectation; over priced ok meal, just like any other airport restaurants I've been so far.  The Kitchen is no different. Our host sat us down quickly. Server was rather slow with our water. He did apologize at the end. All in all service was just \"meh\".  Food wise, it was just not that good. I had the spaghetti with meatballs (extra for meatballs) my sister got the margherita, and a share quinoa kale salad. Out of all three dishes, the salad tasted best. The spaghetti sauce was blend, meatballs were dry and blend. The margherita pizza wasn't great either, any good pizza starts with great dough and sauce. I could tell the pizza had neither. Tasteless tomato sauce, and pizza overall was like bitting through a cardboard. Lastly, can't forget my drink. I order the pineapple cooler. It tasted more like lemonade than pineapple personally. Next time, I'll stick with a salad or sandwich. As you all well know, don't just believe what you're reading, go experience it yourself is my say. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are some haters writing reviews, but I have enjoyed eating at the kitchen whenever I am returning from Calgary to Houston.   First of all, before this terminal was built, there was jack squat for decent food in the YYC terminal for United Flights to H Town. I was ecstatic when they started working on the new terminal, and I absolutely love the results.   As for the kitchen, their breakfast pizza is totally legit. In fact, so are all their pizzas. I always sit at the bar where i can pop open my laptop, grab a drink, and know that the bartender is taking good care of me.  I come to YYC often, and I will keep hitting this spot when I am headed home."}
{"text":"This review is as much about the service as it is about the food.  Our flight was a delayed and my wife and I decided to grab a pizza for our kids to get them fed.  While she ordered at the counter my kids found their way to the bar!  Luckily the bar was empty and the bartender, Quinn, was totally chill about having them visit as I shambled over, kit in tow.  Before you knew it, he was having a conversation with them and serving them OJ and water.  The kids were delighted to be sitting up on the high stools and sipping from actual glasses.  It was picture worthy.  The kids cheese pizza was pretty great too!  My wife and I ended up eating their leftovers and a Caesar salad that we ordered.  First rate!"}
{"text":"The Kitchen is one of the better restaurants in the YYC international terminal.   You can sit at the bar, eat a meal and watch the big screen tv while waiting for your flight connections.  Today the Rangers are knocking the socks off the Blue Jays. I have mixed feelings about this.    Their menus offers small bites, flatbreads and few larger courses.   Today I am taking the bartender's recommendation and having the pepperoni pizza.   The bar is lightly stocked, you won't find the rare and unusual here. Still it is sufficiently served and the two bartenders are not at all lazy."}
{"text":"This location is situated in the brand new international terminal at YYC. Tried the lobster bisque, maple bacon mussels and the chicken & waffles. The vibe was more of the business class clientele around us. I suspect this place is fairly new as the server could not recommend any dishes for us to try. Service was quick and the food was good! If you're not up for fast food fare at the airport, give this place a try."}
