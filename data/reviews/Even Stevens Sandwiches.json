{"text":"The sandwiches are great and the vibe is good. I highly recommend the French dip it was probably the best one I've ever had"}
{"text":"This place is really yummy! Prices are high but they donate. I'm willing to pay a little extra to a company who is giving back! Will definitely keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"The gentleman at the front of house was so friendly and truly made our first experience a great one. What an awesome spot to support local biz and charities while enjoying a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for a salad, read some Yelp reviews, and liked the idea behind the concept of giving back. Wasn't expecting a wait that was well over a half an hour at a sandwich/salad type place though. This was my first visit.

I placed my order, it was busy but it was also close to 1PM so to be expected. I opted to do take-out since most of the seats were full. However, after standing for about 15 minutes it was obvious that the seats were full of people waiting for their food...one woman who complained to the management had waited for an hour! While I can't say for sure how long my wait was, when I took a seat after standing it was at least 30 minutes before my order was ready.

I told the young lady who gave me my order and simply said \"thanks for waiting\" that this was my first visit, and if it was always this busy. She said no, that they had a catering event that caused the delay. I replied that it was well over a half hour wait though, and she just gave me a look and a \"yeah I know.\" 

My salad was good, and I will try this place again since it is very close and I believe you should give more than one chance to a new restaurant. However, if you know that you are making customers who come into your establishment wait this long for their food, you may want to alert them when they order to be more proactive. Or maybe a \"I'm sorry you had to wait so long, we appreciate your business. Here is a cookie for your troubles and I hope you visit us again,\" might be a better response than \"yeah I know.\" Not cool."}
{"text":"Plus another 1/2 star for the excellent service.  We had the capreezy sandwich, chicken & beet salad and du Gouda sandwich as well as  party tators.  The tators were excellent and the sandwiches were very tasty. Side salads are included so filling, too. The salad was ok but nothing too special.  The place is adorable. Very family friendly and a good place to hang out alone too since it has plenty of seating and different sections.  Would definitely go again next time we are in town."}
{"text":"How great is it that all the kids can have fun (community games while you wait) and find something they like on the menu, the food is delicious, and we're helping to reduce hunger in our community? SO great!! :)"}
{"text":"Super tasty! Their roast dip sandwich is divine!  It's the perfect quick lunch. Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 4 stars,  but can't because even though my sandwich was great there are a cadre of things that dragged the score down.  Im new to the area and its a holiday weekend; I wanted to make sure they were open.  I called the number listed here on THEIR Yelp listing, and it didnt go through.  I tried 3 times to make sure it wasn't a user error.  Sadly, it wasn't user error.  So I gambled and hopped in the car.  I get there, tell the girl at the counter I tried calling and she didnt even apologize for the inconvenience.  I also told her it was my first time there to which there was no warmth/welcome....nothing.  I must've been inconveniencing her and keeping her from all 7 people who were there at the time.  I order a Do Gouda sandwich.  She clearly forgot that I mentioned it was my first there and blankly asks what I want for my side.  By the way, sides arent posted plainly anywhere....I promise Im not that person who doesnt look for stuff!  The choices were garden salad or chips.  I chose the garden salad.  I proceeded to wait 15min for my 'to go' order.  I get my order, get back to the car and found that my bag seemed a little light.  I open it to find a sandwich, chips, and a fork/knife for my nonexistent salad.  I should've walked back in to have them fix it, but who knows how long I'd have to wait for my salad.  The sandwich is great though.  If you dont mind lack luster service and dont have anywhere to be this is the place for a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Chill vibes, nice workers, yummy food, & all for a GREAT cause! Love how you can play games while waiting for your food! Not only that, but if you show your ASU school ID, you get free coffee.... #bless! Their breakfast burrito was 10/10 & I can't wait to go back and try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"I was in Arizona over the weekend with a couple friends on a road trip and on our last day in Phoenix we decided to look for a nice place to have brunch before our drive back home. I found this place on Yelp (thanks for always coming through, you never fail me)  and I could not have been more pleased. The service was great, I love their cause (they donate a meal for every sandwich you buy), the food was tasty (I'm vegan so I love that they have several vegan options) the decor was ON POINT and they also had live music. There was this beautiful young woman singing there yesterday, I wish I could remember her name :( Her amazing voice filled the place with a great ambiance, I was singing and grooving in my seat. Great experience, I will definitely be back whenever I am in the area again."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cubano thanks to the temptation of a certain Jon Favreau flick (you all know the one) and I wasn't disappointed. Delicious! A bit greasy for my taste, but good quality ingredients and an even better value and cause to boot. I had been going to Ike's and Which Which for my lunch fix, but I think I have a new go-to sandwich place whenever I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"Been here for lunch on two occasions.  The sandwiches and salads are outstanding and the service is super friendly.  Even better is that they donate a sandwich for every sandwich purchased !"}
{"text":"A great vibe, friendly staff, some fun live music, and  delicious food. The sandwiches are on the sweet side (lots of sugary sauces) but they are tasty. Love the locally roasted coffee and the cookies."}
{"text":"Presentation was great and the food was pretty yummy however the gluten free bread falls apart the second you pick it up. Hopefully they can get a better recipe for their bread."}
{"text":"Awesome interior. I stopped by for lunch around 12:00pm and it was very crowded. I recommend going earlier than that to beat the work crowd. I ordered the Sprang Chicken which was great, minus the bacon. It was very fatty which made it difficult to chew - I ended up removing it from the sandwich so I wouldn't have to deal with it. Other than that, a nice experience!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! This is my new place for sandwiches. Da Gouda is my favorite. I love the crusty bread. We also tried the Sprang Chicken. It was good, A bit dry. The Bahn Belly was yummy too. I tried that one last and by the time I got to it, The bread was a bit soggy from the  slaw but it was still good. There is Sriracha  on it that added a nice kick. 
I ordered at the register at the side when I entered , got my drink and sat down and then the server brought out the food pretty quickly.  Service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Friendly service and good food at a reasonable price. We had the french toast and breakfast burrito - both were really good.
We were there for the 1 millionth sandwich. Congratulations!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty sandwich place. Been to the Gilbert one and the location in Tempe. Not very busy, unique flavors, fun decor and atmosphere. Nice workers. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm a college student down the street as ASU and this new sandwich shop opening is a god send. All the food around our dorm is mediocre. I've been to Even Stevens twice and both sandwiches were delicious. I got the pot roast dip and the capreezy and both are really good. Plus it comes with a side salad (or chips) and a pickle. The mac n cheese and tomato bisque are really good too but kind of expensive ($5) for the portion they give. Place also plays great 80's music it's a really cool vibe. Would definitely recommend I'm gonna keep coming back."}
{"text":"Love the charity concept! Was lucky enough to be able to attend a soft opening for breakfast. Food was great, environment was light/fun and location is awesome (maybe because I work in the plaza). Prices are a smoking deal for the area and I can't wait to return to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"man I really live the cubano I don't think ive ever had a better sandwich and sandwiches rarely tickle my fancy, besides a BLT once in awhile. I really liked everything so far the soup and the pork belly salad. there is a lot of variety and its not your cookie cutter place, every sandwich is different im actually looking forward to trying all of it. I give this place an A ok one of the best lunch spots in the area. affordable and really chill. a cool hand out."}
{"text":"This  place is amazing. The best sandwich I have had in a long time. I got the Turkey day. Even though there was a wait, so worth it. Will go back again!!"}
{"text":"One word can describe the entire experience : PERFECT! The food, staff and ambiance were all great. If you are in Phoenix, you have to go for lunch!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches!! Excellent service!! And the free cookie with yelp check in is just icing on the cake! Will definitely be my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch sandwiches. Nice mood, helpful staff, and they're running the place for a good cause. (Get the capreezy. Trust me.)"}
{"text":"Always great food and a friendly staff! Looking forward to my next meal here each time i leave!"}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten at ES before but saw the great reviews and thought I'd try their breakfast burrito since they had tots in them. Tots rock BTW. I had the Undergrad with the sausage and pork belly. YUM! Great flavor, slightly toasted and crispy tortilla, meat was warm and flavorful, cheese all melty, egg scrambled and hot, and house sauce was complementary/flavorful without being overwhelming. I was really looking forward to that first hot, crispy-crunchy tot bite

I got to the tot. Cold, chewy, disappointing. Maybe it was a one off fluke. I mean, they have tots all over their menu. They seem to stake their reputation, at least partly, on their tot offering. They must know how to tot right. 

Nope. I pulled a tot out to eat it alone and same disappointment. Tots ruined what started out as a great breakfast. I told the staff and they quickly replaced the burrito. The second burrito was much better. Tots were warm, and not chewy, but still not crispy-crunchy. So ES only gets 4 stars because they don't do their tots crispy-crunchy. 

I learned they bake their tots. I think you can still get a crispy-crunchy tot with baking. Maybe it was an off day or new kitchen staff. I'll try them again or try another location at some point."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I had the stuffed French toast with a side of eggs and bacon. It was some of the best stuffed French toast I've ever had! You can tell their ingredients are fresh just by the taste. I love the fact that I can come in at 2pm and order breakfast. Excellent customer service from everyone! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Waited a long time for this shop to open and it is so much better than a typical sandwich shop. Service was great and the setup is very unique! I like the different items available on the menu. I believe it was a suede green couch really made the place pop! Also, they donate sandwiches! What a awesome concept! Definitely will return!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and helping good causes. Check it out instead of waiting in line for over an hour at the other restaurants."}
{"text":"This place really rocks. Nice ambience, nice and helpful staff who go out of the way to make the customers feel good."}
{"text":"Love everything here.  Food was amazing an priced great.  Service was warm and friendly.  Loved they serve the community buy giving back.  Board games offered if you had time to hang out."}
{"text":"I went in this morning for Brunch--my first time at Even Stevens. I ordered their stuffed French Toast... Two layers of french toast, with a banana cream inbetween, and then covered with a fresh berry coulis.  Ordering was easy, with no yelling as another poster experienced. I got my number and took a seat in the nearly empty dining room. One bubbly employee was in the dining room, tending to things and singing along with the music. She gave the place a nice energy, even though it was pretty empty. The food came out fairly quickly and was delivered to my table. It looked great, and the flavors were fantastic, BUT, the french toast was barely luke warm. And the toast itself was tough. I needed a knife to cut it, instead of just being able to use my fork. But since it tasted so good, I just ate it as it came. When i got about 3/4 way thru with it, an employee (the same man who took my order originally) stopped by and asked how everything was. I told him that it tasted great, but did not come out hot. He kinda stammered a little and said he would let \"them\" know about it. He continued on doing various tasks in the dining room, and, as far as I could tell while I was there, never once said anything to anyone about my cold french toast. 

I will come back and try again. The food was good, but there was obviously some kink in the system where hot food doesn't get out hot. Work on the service (front and back of house) to make sure hot food is hot and you will have a winner here.."}
{"text":"Lots of growing pains with this restaurant.  Food was good but few options for drinks.  Only sodas available, no ice tea because they don't have a tea machine yet - try boiling some water, toss in tea bags, wait 15 minutes and put it in a dispenser.  The idea of a sandwich for charity for each one sold is a good one.  Hope the restaurant does well - it could be a nice addition for lunch downtown."}
{"text":"I just had the breakfast sandwich that came with tater tots.  Never again...  Tater tots had that nasty freezer burned flavor and the sandwich was 90% bread, 5% processed eggs, 3% avocado spread, and 2% I didn't recognize.  
If you must have a hippie experience in Phoenix, check it out.  If you want breakfast that doesn't make you feel queezie, go to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Even Stevens Sandwiches was close to ASU and had an abundant amount of room to sit both inside and outside. The menu had some interesting choices and our sandwiches for two were pretty good with a side of grilled mac and cheese for around $18. The waitress also gave us some tips on things to do in downtown Phoenix. Would recommend, but not a must try!"}
{"text":"The Sandwich I had was OK. Most of the ingredients where put in the middle. Second Place that I've been to that did that. The Potato Tots where pretty bland.  Needless to say it did not make me want to return. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place was OK. Bought two BLT chopped salads- they didn't have any tomatoes although the menu says it comes with tomatoes. The Reuben was OK in size, was a little dry but they gave me more dressing. The sauerkraut is not your typical sauerkraut and gave the sandwich a different taste. Bought my son a kids meal and the boxed chocolate milk was spoiled/thick. They replaced it with a fountain drink. The location is nice and clean. Very open feeling, went in the early afternoon and it was nice and quiet. The staff was nice."}
{"text":"Wow , that was an amazing Cuban sandwich! Got it to go so i could relax in my hotel room with a book and a beer while my gal is at her conference. It was so delicious and decadent that I must take my gal to this place again before I leave Phoenix. The inside is artsy fartsy (an English term) and reminiscent of some of my favorite places back home. Oh and the beer choices inside look great too!

Also they donate their food to charity , Awesome!"}
{"text":"Even Stevens is a delicious sandwich shop with a purpose. We love the food because it is fresh and flavorful. Staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and all sandwiches and salads that we ordered were exceptional! Will definitely come back again for more!"}
{"text":"After a long flight from Boston, my daughters and I found this place on yelp. Said they had breakfast all day. Got there at 8:30 PM.  I cannot review the food because we placed our order for French toast, paid, then sat down. The person who took our order came over and said they ran out of bread. So we went back to the cashier and got a credit and re-ordered a beet salad. We paid and sat down. Five minutes later he came back and said they ran out of beets. So we got another credit and left. Looks like a pretty cool place but has a very limited menu. Also some very unsavory characters were in there which made the place seem very unappetizing.  The gentleman at the cash register was VERY nice but he should've been better informed by the kitchen about what items they ran out of or what they still had to offer. I'm hoping that my two credits went through because I didn't get a receipt for either transaction. Also the music was much too loud! We kept moving tables to see if we could find a place not under a loud speaker but it was impossible!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best sandwich shop in the west valley. All of the ingredients are super fresh and everything is super delicious...breakfast, lunch or dinner!! This place is a gem!! Bonus: the staff is super polite and very attentive!!"}
{"text":"We had the Sloppy Joe's, Rueben, Baked Mac, and chips and queso. What a pleasant surprise! Fun atmosphere, delicious food, and price on point! Would come back again and again to try it all!"}
{"text":"I came here because I liked the giving aspect of the restaurant. I ordered the BLT Cobb and the salad was basically all lettuce. There was at most 3 grape tomatoes and the kettle chips were so salty that I had to pick them out. The plus was that there was plenty of pork. Overall the salad was nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"SO HAPPY EVEN STEVENS IS NOW LOCATED IN DOWNTOWN CHANDLER!! I first tried this place in Gilbert and fell in love! This location is just as fun, clean, and friendly as the Gilbert location (with the added convenience of being much closer to my house.) All of the menu items are fresh & delicious, but I'd recommend the hummazing vegan- my personal favorite! The staff is so friendly and welcoming (which is so refreshing!!) Now that I am in closer proximity to an Even Stevens, you can be sure that I'll be here (frequently) to grab a great sandwich for a great cause!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE
The sandwiches/salads are great and so is the service! Not to mention, they support such a great cause! Would recommend the hummazing vegan sandwich or the jack fruit torta with the side salad. Can't wait to come back and try something new!"}
{"text":"The food here was average at best. I got the Mihami Vice, which was soggy and bland. The meat in the sandwich was fatty and chewy and it just made me not want to eat anymore. My girlfriend ordered a kids sandwich because the menu didn't have anything that sounded remotely satisfying. She ordered fruit, which came out black and practically inedible. I never write reviews, but this place is an exception."}
{"text":"I dont usually leave reviews unless the place is really good or really bad. Even stevens is exceptionally good, and Im a sandwich snop and a hard critic of sandwich joints. I had the rueben, it was delicious, the perfect portion with warm soft bread, and side salad was fancy greens with a homemade dressing. This joint has a very cool concept, unique decor, and they sell beer and clothes there. You will pay a little more here and wait a little longer than most sandwich joints...but its well worth it."}
{"text":"A surprise find with a great mission. Food was delicious -- had the \"Turkey Day\" with cran-peña ( yes - cranberry & jalapeño) sauce on super good sourdough bread comes with a salad that has homemade dressing and cherry tomatoes sliced on a mandolin! My husband had a pot roast dip sandwich that was huge and it was actually was TURKEY - yet tasted like beef!   Also enjoyed a lot!
Their mission of working with three main charity organizations for assistance is touted and obvious inside the restaurant. Great people work who are warm and very helpful. Going back!!!"}
{"text":"Really good Cubano.  Don't expect little Havana in Phoenix, but solid.  Display case for drinks was odd.  They have fountain drinks but all that is on display is beer and bottled water/Gatorade.  Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"According to a tattooed older gentleman that identified himself as a manager, they do not accept Arizona state i.d. cards as a valid form of identification. As a person that does not own or operate a motor vehicle I find this incredibly troubling, especially coming from a management position. I will definitely head to one of the many other establishments in the downtown area that do accept state I.D.'s."}
{"text":"The humazingly vegan sandwich is humazingly good!  Friendly staff and good eats made fresh and fast."}
{"text":"My first time eating at Even Stevens.  Stopped in for lunch and had the Reuben sandwich...hands down, the best Reuben I have eaten in a long time, maybe ever.  Corned beef was incredibly flavorful and tasty, and the marble rye bread was great.  Absolutely delicious.

Cindy had the Mihami Vice (aka Cubano), and said it was really good.  I cheated and tased a bite of it,  and i agree.  It's a pretty classic Cuban sandwich with pulled pork, ham, and pickles on a baguette, and according to Cindy is a definite \"eat again.\"

Friendly, cheerful staff who were very helpful to a couple of first time visitors was a great bonus."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches, my wife said it was her best sandwich she ever had. She had the turkey I had the beef dip."}
{"text":"This was our first time and it was not great. We ordered two salads and Brussel sprouts. My salad was iceberg lettuce with some blue cheese and bacon thrown on top. The other salad was a chicken and beet salad, 2/3's was beets 1/3 was chicken (maybe 3 oz). Brussel sprouts came out uncooked and with a very sweet sauce on top.

Guess you should not get salads at a sandwich shop, dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and kid friendly! I have breakfast, lunch and dinner there. No complaints. They accidentally billed me for an extra kids meal, I found out later and told them, they gave me a $20 gift card. I have also ordered online, and the process is very smooth. FYI, everyone I go with loves the tomato soup!"}
{"text":"We went for brunch to get french toast, ended up getting the stuffed french toast and tots. We forgot to ask if these were part of the Sunday unlimited french toast and unfortunately they weren't (our mistake). We should have gone with just regular french toast- the filling is barely there and overly sweet. I did have to send my meal back as it was cold and stale... I think they're still trying to work out the kinks. Major issue- we watched and employee drop drink lids all over the floor, pick them up, and restock with them. The manager happily took care of it though when we alerted him.

Overall, nothing special but may get better with time.Perhaps turn down the music and keep the doors closed when it's cold and rainy out like today though ;) I must add, all the employees were very kind and helpful! They really made the visit enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great service. The food is delicious. Had the Go Guda, really good  and almost too big for 1 person."}
{"text":"One word ... WOW!
Great location, cool people and awesome food.
Ordered the Mihami Vice ... The Even Stevens interpretation of a Cubano.
Absolutely amazing.
My go to lunch place.
See you there!!!!
Thanks for coming to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Variety in menu to deliver most any desired result. The gluten free bun one of the best my wife has had.  Great and friendly service, which was significant considering how new and busy they were. And great underlying society mission, donating back to the community"}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time, and everything was great. All the sandwiches and breakfast options looked so good that it was difficult to choose...I went with the the jackfruit tapa and was not disappointed. The service was also really excellent. They had a huge lunch rush, but the long line went quick, and I only waited about 5 minutes for my food after I placed my order. I think they were understaffed because there were only 2 guys working in the front of the house, but they were both super friendly and kept their composure even with the large crowd. I will definitely be going back to try some of their other options."}
{"text":"Saw an ad for this place on Facebook and decided to give it a try for takeout and my boyfriend and I were really impressed! We ordered the Cuban and the Do Gouda and both were delicious. The house chips were great, kettle chip level of crispy. We also ordered a side of Mac and cheese and it was really good. Nice and simple with big chucks of bacon. On the whole, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The guy next to me says this is a dinner sandwich, what does that mean?  I had the Pot Roast Dip. Good sandwich.  I suppose I don't eat pot roast for lunch or breakfast so maybe that's what makes it a dinner sandwich.  My question is the sandwich was made with turkey. What is turkey pot roast?  I asked the staff and they couldn't answer my question.  The sandwich I would give 4 stars.  The chips I got were crumbs so minus point there.  Also got the Party Tots.  Basically taster tots with everything on them.  They were barely warm.  And we're mushy.  Will not get those again.  Beer Cheese and pretzel sticks were a tastier option but they came after then sandwiches came out.  Will I be back? Yes. Couple other good looking sandwiches to try."}
{"text":"Great food, cool space and fair prices. All that plus $2 beers. I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Fantastic find! The sandwiches were sooo unique and flavorful!! This place is very hipster and fun, casual atmosphere. Decor is great and the seating indoor or outdoor is vey contemporary. We sat and waited and played Uno. They had other games too! We love that they donate to local food banks too. What a great concept; makes you want to go there more often!  We ordered the Turkey pot roast...soooo good with Jalepeno jelly and Swiss cheese. Mahi mahi sandwich was delish and light and not fishy tasting. The Miami Cuban was outstanding too!! Wow! Yelp pulled through again!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever had. Fast service, great prices, great quality food. I'll be back, probably tomorrow. Haha."}
{"text":"???????????????????hangout?????ASU????free coffee all day?"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are good but there could be more meat. Was here on a Sunday afternoon and the music was so loud that it hurt my ears and having a conversation was hard."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and good sandwiches! The turkey Day is my favorite! Very nice and friendly staff! This is one of our top sandwich stops for sure!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, an amazing industrial chic vibe and fun for the whole family!  The kids found some games to keep them busy and the adults could enjoy their time together as well."}
{"text":"This place serves great sandwiches at reasonable prices. It is definitely one of the better sandwich joints in Gilbert. If you're sick of waiting for your table at one of the downtown restaurants and could go for a sandwich or salad instead, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fantastic service, and a wonderful cause! Highly recommend eating at Even Stevens!"}
{"text":"Sadly my new favorite salad -BLT chopped -has suffered and now the salad which previously had great pieces of pork belly, now is being served with only the \"fat portion of the pork belly. I requested a do over, and was told this is a fatty piece of meat. Not happy"}
{"text":"The Caprezzy and Bfast Burrito are excellent.  Substituted the meat for avocado in the Burrito...... and the smokey salsa on the side was a great addition."}
{"text":"Amazing food, everything on the menu is delicious. What's even better is that this is an honest company who cares more about making a difference than making a profit. If you haven't stopped in yet you're missing out."}
{"text":"Nice people, good causes, great food.  Been here for brunch a few times, the Morrisey burrito is great for us that don't eat pork or beef, very tasty.  The jackfruit torta is great too!  But the people that work here are amazing and friendly and make this place special."}
{"text":"A friend of mine works in the field and has to eat out a lot and we are always sharing good places to dine.  He said to come here and try the Da Gouda so I took my husband yesterday and ordered that.  He got the Pot Roast sandwich with chips....  mine was good but the Pot Roast...oh...my.... gosh..off the chain deliciousness... it has jalapeno jelly on it with cheese and onions and it tastes like your mother's homemade pot roast.  We sat in silence and savored every bite.  The staff was so nice and answered all our questions about the ingredients and what the restaurant was all about.  I may sneak a visit today while running errands.  It definitely is out \"go to \" sandwich place.  And lucky for us we live so close by. They have some amazing things on their menu and we can't wait to go down the list and try them all."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for lunch. The food is fresh, large portions and very reasonable. Staff is very pleasant and very helpful. Plus dollar and two dollar beers. How can you go wrong. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great experience here today. Reasonably-priced in a cool location. To start off our waitress was welcoming and very helpful. She stroke a good balance between recommending yummy specialties from the menu and leaving time for us to decide by ourselves. I got the special corned beef sandwich which was really good, steaming caramelized onions and fresh bread that was still fluffy in the middle when it came out. My girlfriend had some sweet potato ravioli which I also tried, it had just the right amount of sauce and a loads of tasty mushrooms. After food we had such a nice chat with the waitress that we almost forgot to pay."}
{"text":"Was promised a gift card... was going to pass it on to a homeless person... gift card has not been sent."}
{"text":"A sammy AND helping those in need? SIGN ME UP!

I found myself downtown waiting for a meeting to start at the convention center when Even Stevens popped up in my recommendations on Yelp, and I was just as pleased to try as I was excited to stop in!

I went for the pot roast dip sandwich (name?) and the kettle chips: SO good! I added so many of the other mouth watering options to my \"must try\" list so a follow-up visit is a must! A great space to remotely work, and an even friendlier staff make this place jump to the top of my Phoenix favorites in my first month of exploring!"}
{"text":"They have amazing jackfruit sandwiches! Great customer service, chill atmosphere, and the workers are truly aware of veganism!"}
{"text":"I love this chain!  Great flavors, friendly staff and they give back to the community by feeding the hungry.   The location is kind of one off... but not far off the beaten path.   Great for a sando anytime"}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the first time.  I got the reuben with tots and my girlfriend ordered the grilled cheese with tots.  When I walked in they were freshly bagging up my order.  Well, full disclosure we tried a tot as soon as we got in the car and it was not hot or fresh at all.  That seemed to be an indicator of what the rest of the meal would be like.

First of all I know there is something to be taken into consideration when getting food to go.  But the fact is they were wrapping it up as I arrived and not one single item we received was hot.  Both of the sandwiches seemed like they had been set on the griddle for about 10 seconds but neither of them were the slightest bit brown or crispy.  I got a few bites into my reuben and the rest of the meat was essentially just fat so I could not finish it.  My girlfriend's grilled cheese had good flavor but almost no cheese.  And the tots tasted like they had been sitting on the counter for 24 hours before they were boxed up for us.

Most of the food we got we didn't finish and it wasn't worth saving.  Pretty disappointed as we were really excited to try this place but we definitely won't be back.  We ended up getting sandwiches somewhere else later that day since most of our food ended up in the trash."}
{"text":"Pretty good vegetarian options, we had the hummazing sandwich, jackfruit torta and tomato basil bisque. Hummazing sandwich is really awesome, top notch. Jackfruit torta is pretty good, might get some getting used to. The bisque was ok. Overall a great experience, will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"I thought the flavor of my jackfruit sandwich was delicious and I give five stars for the flavor, however the gluten free bread was just terrible. It immediately fell apart and was stale. I ended up making a bowl instead of eating it like a sandwich. I am sure there are amazing bread options when you are not gluten free, so please don't let my gluten free opinion keep you from trying this place! :) I would give the gluten free bread one star. I hope it will be improved one day. 

I was not happy with how I was treated by an employee taking my order. She asked me if I wanted chips or a salad on the side. I asked her what are the ingredients in the chips. She was extremely rude about it and snapped \"it's just regular potato chips\". Well, I am sorry she felt inconvenienced by my auto immune illness which doesn't allow me to eat everything I want. There are certain kinds of oils and ingredients in many potato chips that I cannot have. But not all are bad. If she doesn't know, all she had to do is grab a handbook (which almost all places will have) with the ingredient in all of their food listed. I did not appreciate the way I was treated due to my restricted diet because of an illness. I don't think I'll be back because of that. 

However, if you are craving a sandwich, I recommend this place as long as you don't have crazy restrictions when it comes to food. :)"}
{"text":"Best Pot Roast Dip sandwiches I have ever had.  I will order this anytime.  I'm had to steal this photo just to post this.   Lame!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I came in late for a training and was shown such care and accommodations in creating my meal! Later, I went back for lunch and saw them feeding a homeless man sowing him such hospitality! The food is exceptional with wonderful various dishes! Here's my bruises sprouts! And the prices are accommodating!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with mt 11 year old and the girls were super friendly and took the time to explain their menu and their story.  Aside from being really customer service orientated the food was great my kid ate her whole sandwich!"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly a great sandwich place ... the bread was awesome the combination was inventive and out side the box... I loved the vibe and what they are doing for their community..... great job Even Stevens !!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. They give one sandwich to charity for every sandwich sold."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were a 2/10. They were too messy and both of the sandwiches that I ordered were sopping with an oily liquid which absolutely ruined all of the chips. I understand how one meat may be bad but both the beef and ham were. Even the sandwiches that I saw being made were sloppy too. I ordered the cubano sandwich and it didn't taste like a cubano at all. It had a weird sweet creamy flavor that absolutely shouldn't be in a cubano sandwich. I defiantly wouldn't go back for lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches, interesting sides, good service.  We went for lunch, all 4 of us got something different and each of us loved it.  JP Grilled Cheese was so good."}
{"text":"I recently moved around the corner from here so it's really convenient and close. I have a really hard time finding a decent salad and the BLT Salad really hits the spot for me. It's always been very fresh and they don't mind special requests to make it how I like it. The employees are friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is okay. I always prefer to eat outside and the patio is my favorite spot. My biggest issue is my latest to go order I placed last night. I opened the bag and they had added quacamole, some type of crushed potato chips, I think, and they ADDED the wrong type of cheese and NO DRESSING. Also, I noticed sometimes I get a huge amount of pork belly and last night I found literally mere specs of it. I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but can't just yet. I will go back and see how it goes but I'll definitely be double checking my order before I leave."}
{"text":"Love this spot. Breakfast sandwhich is tasty and Michelle always takes good care of our team who are now regulars. Quite inexpensive for the quality. They donate a sandwhich for every one you buy."}
{"text":"Basic menu.  Good food and they include a side salad or chips with the sandwich.
They also feed the poor with some of the profit."}
{"text":"Went there to try a new lunch place out. The sandwiches were very good and option of chips or salad was very nice. I would recommend it for a nice lunch spot. Also the guy at counter was very friendly and outgoing and made it that much better! I ask so he gave his top choice and I normally don't but I just went with it and happy I did!"}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMEND: the Hummazing Sandwich. Delicious blend of vegetables and multi-grain bread.
Pro tip: order the salad dressing on the side. There was just a bit too much on my side salad.
Owner and staff were super friendly. Live music on Sundays and $4 all you can eat French toast that my boyfriend ordered and raved over. WOW. 
Check out Even Stevens. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Such a good experience when I come. Its easier to walk here from certain downtown buildings than driving. I had the truly day sandwich, and it's a good blend of flavors across the havarti cheese, tomato paste spread (gives a bit of spice) but the cran-peno jelly gives that sweet ending. Plus they have a community donation program, check it out."}
{"text":"This place is pretty rad. Ordered the Mihami Vice and Hummazing Vegan and they both delivered. Delicious! Staff is friendly and they have some board games. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"The Hummazing Vegan sandwich, so freaking good! Went in at a busy time and got lunch to go, they were quick and super friendly. And I saw they have a couple other vegan options which I will definitely be trying next!"}
{"text":"Slooooow service, even on web orders. 
Food is pretty good and a good value.  Large selection of sandwiches and other fare."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast and was surprised, great food. The breakfast burrito is amazing with tots inside, super friendly guys working here too. I recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"French toast is nothing to write home about but for 3 bucks who cares. The sammies and bravarian tots are off the chain and the fact they donate food to the needy is the definition of cool."}
{"text":"Nice! The people, the building, the seating, the food, the concept...  NICE!  There are a lot of sandwich shops out there. Generally speaking, a lot of them are pretty much the same. Lather, rinse, repeat. Even Stevens busts the mold! A good, unique sandwich (I had the turkey day) with an excellent salad and an attention to detail included with everything. That's hard to beat right there! But wait... there's more! They partner with local charities to help supply food to those in need! Are you kidding me? That content feeling in my stomach might not just be good fresh and tasty ingredients but a knowledge of giving something back. Like I said, NICE!"}
{"text":"My husbands sandwich was wrong on every level. When I asked the manager if we were getting another one he was exceptionally rude! He said well your husband said he wanted a refund and I didn't know. He then said again in a horrible tone well now you know. When my husband said he owed me an apology he was oblivious. Said he was not rude at all. Gave us two ten dollar gift cards that we gave to the homeless person outside. We didn't want the cards."}
{"text":"Places like this amaze me when they aren't packed to brim. $3 all you can eat French toast on Sundays?!? They donate to feed the hungry, the employees are amazing,
and there was live music. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere!!!! Large open windows and great service! Very quick good lunch portion."}
{"text":"Loved it!!! Great workers  loved the environment & the cookies.  Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"I will say I wish Even Stevens had more vegan options. I thoroughly enjoyed this place. 

The ambience will make you want to stay and relax for hours, they have board games and comfy chairs. It reminds me of bohemian shops around the valley with a Tempe atmosphere. 

Everyone working was exceptionally friendly, and we came in 30 minutes before closing. 

I hope they offer more vegan options in the future. 
I got the Jackfruit Torta, which has a kick to it. Nevertheless delicious."}
{"text":"I always give places two chances before I say \"Nope!\".  Well, today is the day Even Stevens gets a big, fat NOPE.  NEVER AGAIN.  Today i ordered for pickup for the second time and was left, once again, thoroughly disappointed.  The first time I ordered, my sandwich was completely deconstructed and they didn't include my side order.  This time, I ordered the chopped salad and added chicken for an additional $2.  Guess what? No freaking chicken on my salad.  Also, this is THE WORST chopped salad I have ever had - ice berg lettuce, hardly chopped at all, a few tomatoes, a smattering of sliced grape tomatoes and a sprinkle of blue cheese with a few chunks of pork belly; for the $10 I spent, I could've made myself a better salad with ingredients from the CVS down the street.  Way to let me down once again, Even Stevens.  I will never patron your store again and I will never recommend anyone eat there."}
{"text":"Love the vibe from this place! The sandwiches are our favorite! My son begs for this place very often. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here--we were looking for a lunch sandwich shop that offer salads. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Hubby got sprang chicken sandwich with a side salad. I got chicken and berry sandwich. You can tell from our pic it was horrible--kidding! We forgot to take the before pic. But trust us...it was good. We will definitely be back with the kids. Totally kid friendly and they offer a variety of kid games. They have lounge seating if you want to hang out a bit. Weather was good so windows were open near bar area. It was perfect. For sure coming back. Oh and the best part--eat to give makes it even program makes it even better. For every sandwich sold they give back to nonprofits!! Win win"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great atmosphere and wonderful food. I'll be excited to eat here again! They have a unique twist on old time classic sandwiches and other delicious foods."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. With the four plus star rating I figured it had to be a winner. They were busy when I arrived. Ordering line moved, and food came out faster then expected. I ordered the Rueben from the limited menu. Sandwich was small, and not a lot of meat. Did not care for their cabbage, and taste was so so. House chips were ok. Jason's deli Rueben blows them away! Not likely to return."}
{"text":"Great place! Came on a Sunday morning around 11 and had no problem getting a table and served quickly. I brought my vegan relatives and they loved their food and the options they had on the menu. Cool atmosphere, super easy parking, and a wonderful cause. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I yelped for vegan and Even Stevens came up.   Only a couple blocks from the hotel I decided to give it a try.   What a great decision.  I was greeted warmly by Sean.  Placing my order was quick and easy and I was even given some recommendations on lunch should I come back in the next few days.  My food was prepared quickly and was extremely fresh and delicious.  I got the Monterrey vegan breakfast burrito.  The tortilla was super fresh.  The tofu and soyrizo were well prepared and exceptionally seasoned and flavorful.    And best of all it's food for a cause.   I highly recommend this place and will definitely go back when I'm in the area ."}
{"text":"Love the place and the people!  My co-workers and I (3 of us) decided to grab Evan Stevens for lunch Friday.  I'm so glad we did!  I've tried a few different types of sandwiches during a Yelp Frenzy event last year and loved them.  I don't live near an Evan Stevens so I never dined in, until last week when my co-workers invited me for lunch.  I had no idea our office was so close to an Evan Stevens.  The weather was great last Friday so we decided to head out of the office for lunch.  

Between the 3 of us we tried the Pastrami Sandwich with a salad, pretzels and cheese, tomato soup and the wedge salad.  I personally had the Pastrami sandwich but tried everyone's lunch.  I loved my Pastrami Sandwich and I LOVED the pretzels and cheese.  I'm not sure what kind of bread those pretzels were made of but boy were they tasty.  They taste like sweet, wheat bread like I've never had before. We couldn't get enough!  The tomato soup was ok ... I could do without that.  The Wedge salad was scrumptious .... If I were to get it in the future, I'd get it without the potato chips on top.  Yes, there's kettle cooked potato chips on top of the wedge salad. The bacon in the salad is pork belly instead of regular bacon.  It was scrumptious!  

After we ordered, we sat down to chat.  Within minutes our orders were coming out.  Both the food and service was awesome.  So much so that I'm heading back to Evan Stevens soon. Next time I'm trying something totally different."}
{"text":"Love the look of this place and the food was pretty good. I loved it even more when the manager came over and explained how for every sandwich or salad or burrito that is purchased they give the same amount of money (in food cost) to charities around the valley that feed hungry people. Service was very good and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is a fun little shop. Eclectic atmosphere and fun games to play. Different but delicious sandwiches plus breakfast is served all day. Great costumer service lots of choices of drinks and live music. Fun older music. Live music Saturday-Monday"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Affordable and chill place to eat at! Love the interior design and friendly staff. Also coming back for the unlimited French toast on Sunday."}
{"text":"Wish I could do 4.5 stars. Good atmosphere, fast service, and delicious food! I had the Cuban and it was amazing! Can't wait to try more, because they all sounded amazing!"}
{"text":"Had a breakfast burrito, honest to God tastiest breakfast burrito ever. Did the eggs over easy in it, had delicious sauce and mixture of ingredients. Everything is so cheap during breakfast too"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place 4 starts but I feel things happened during our experience that brought it down. We ordered the jackfruit carnitas Tortas and they were bomb! The atmosphere was super chill at first, and they even had a guy singing songs with his guitar. We also ordered the vegan tots which came out really hard and burnt. When we told the lady she looked at our tots and made a ew face. She said she was as going to tell someone in the back but it seemed like she was just telling us what we wanted to hear and no action. We didn't eat our vegan tots and it would have been nice of them to hook it up right. There was like 2 other people there I think we're customers, and 2 other ladies that worked there but was busy chatting with another guy the whole time, I think 1 of them was a manger. It was awkward after a while especially when we realized the lady was not coming back out with fresh tots. So confusing!"}
{"text":"Better than expected!! This place has a really cool eclectic vibe, with glass garage doors to open up on nice days and sometimes even live music. Pleasantly surprised by the selection of beers (canned) and $3 mimosas on Sundays! The sloppy joe sandwich was delicious, and it came with chips and a pickle. Chicken sandwich was also very good. 

Prices were very reasonable, place was really clean  and staff (and not sure, but maybe the owner?) super friendly! Excited to hear they will add another location on the west side!"}
{"text":"Soooo good! Fresh made sandwiches! I had the breakfast burrito and it's probably one of the best I've had. Nice variety of sandwiches and sides. Will please everyone! Will be back."}
{"text":"Another birthday dinner was celebrated at this great place that focuses on givig back! The sandwiches and salad was fresh and tasty. The turkey in one of the sandwiches was a nice thick juicy cut of breast, white meat. The restaurant is in a cluster of new places in downtown gilbert and parking can either be found in a dirt lot, just north of the canal or in the parking garage, not too far away. We were a bit concerned that there wouldnt be enough seating for our group of 7 but it turned out fine. They had a live musician in one part of the restaurant. And while a nice touch, it was a little out of place on a Sunday afternoon and it made conversation a little hard because he was a little on the loud side. They have one of the fancy soda machines with a million options. Like other reviewers have said, for every sandwich purchased, each location donates one sandwich to a few local causes. This location had 3 listed and while we were there, this location donated about 300 sandwiches. They also were tracking the statewide or national (?) count of donated sandwiches. We did not take advantage of the unlimited french toast and $3 mimosas while we were there but that gives us another reason to return!"}
{"text":"Awesome Sandwiches, would recommend the sprang chicken. Wish they had different chips, their only chips have a hint of salt and vinegar chips which are not my favorite. One of the few sandwich shops that sells alcohol as well. 
A special trait about this restaurant is for every purchase they donate to a organization. They have the donations they donate to on a big broad. Pretty cool if you ask me."}
{"text":"I first tried the downtown Phoenix location and it was amazing so I went back with a few friends to split & try more entrees. We had the mahi mahi bahn mi, stuffed French toast, and the Cuban style sandwich. Everything was amazing. When I heard that they opened up a location by my house in Peoria I was ecstatic. 

We just tried the new location this morning & everything was perfect. My husband had the loaded tots & Do Gouda sandwich, daughter had a really large sized kids PB & J sandwich which came with sliced bananas & a drink, my son had the stuffed French toast & loved it and I tried the Vegan sandwich. Despite missing meat and having gluten free bread it was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had! 

Everything was fresh and delicious & we will be hitting up the Peoria location regularly."}
{"text":"Such a good place and great service! Good food, I like how they donate food as well! Really appreciate what they do for the community! Overall I enjoy everything!"}
{"text":"I visited this spot for breakfast. They had nice covered outdoor seating, but since I was not used to the Arizona heat, I went inside for my breakfast.

The inside was quite large, with lots and lots of seating options. Since the spot is located at the corner lot, it was very bright in the inside with natural light. 

To the left of the entrance is the order counter. When I walked in around 8:30am, it was empty... I was expecting some king of a morning rush, but I don't think I saw a single soul in here... But, that didn't stop me from getting my breakfast.

I ordered a Breakfast Sandwich that comes with two eggs and choice of meat or avocado, cheddar cheese on Hawaiian Bun. For meat, I wanted pork belly, but the staff told me that they don't offer pork belly option any more...how sad...

The sandwich was pretty darn tasty! Hawaiian bun was like a softer pretzel buns, with little sweetness to it. The eggs were fluffy, and bacon strips were crunchy, cloud-like buns...yum! Another thing I loved was that it came with tater tots instead of home fries. The tater tots were nothing really special, but comforting. It was quite filling, I took about half of it back with me. 

Another treat I got was their sugar cookie, for FREE!!! How? Well, I checked in at this spot with Yelp, and it gave me a free cookie! Yes! Thank you Yelp! 

The staff here was not very friendly, but nice enough and willing to help."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, not like your boring chain sandwich place.  Good place for decent breakfast burritos as well."}
{"text":"I had the half grilled cheese with jalapeno with tomato basil soup.Both were delicious! It's a cute place for sandwiches. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Fabulous food and a great cause. The folks here donate food to food banks and missions to help feed people down on their luck. The restaurant is causal industrial chic with colorful murals and incredibly friendly and accommodating staff. What a way to start our Friday morning.  Just here in Phoenix visiting, but while I'm here, this will be my go to place."}
{"text":"We tried this place based on proximity to our hotel and other reviews. We were immediately greeted by a very friendly employee. She was super nice,  gave us ample time to review the menu and made recommendations. The breakfast sandwich was fantastic! I recommend this place without hesitation. Yes, the music is a little loud but it fits with the atmosphere they are creating. The manager, Danny, even stopped by to check on our experience!"}
{"text":"Fast delivery, delicious sandwiches, not expensive. All top notch except mac and cheese, pass on that!"}
{"text":"I work around the corner from this place and came in and tried the mihama cubano and love this place, it's one of my favorite subs now....great service as well. I highly recommend this place to anyone....."}
{"text":"In love with this concept coming from SLC-based Even Stevens of eat-to-give. The space is beautiful, the sandwiches are made fresh with honestly sourced ingredients, and the passion of the people who started this business and work here is tangible! As far as food, I tried their pot roast, sprang chicken, cubano and their breakfast burrito and they are all exceptional. The portions are big, the fillings are generous, and they have have a unique twist in each of their offerings. For instance pot roast sandwich takes a jalapeno jam made by a local company (Cotton Country Jams), which was unexpected and gave just the right kick to the sandwich. I am still thinking about their food, that is how good it is. The proverbial cherry on top is the price which is very reasonable (don't think I saw anything above 8-9 dollars!). Last but not least, you can be sure to feel good about this meal knowing that Even Stevens donates to local charities (list displayed conspicuously on their wall) with every sandwich sold. What is not to like about this place?"}
{"text":"I was so excited to attend the soft opening of Even Stevens, a local sandwich shop which gives back to the community with every purchased meal. 

Everyone that worked here was so gracious and friendly, welcoming all into their space. The team is like a close-knit family and I felt right at home. I learned a lot about Even Steven's aim to give back to the community & where they locally source their ingredients. 

This is unlike any basic sub shop, think more artisanal like Earl of Sandwich. They have a multitude of delicious sandwich choices with unique names like Sprang Chicken, Mihami Vice, and even vegetarian options like Jackfruit Torta! I had the Sprang Chicken which consisted of chicken, provolone, avocado, bacon, tomatoes, cucumbers, greens, honey mustard on multi-grain bread paired with kettle chips and a pickle. It was delicious!!!! They also have salads, small bites and brunch options. Tonight, their vendor, Peixoto was also there to promote their coffee. Super nutty, rich, and delicious!! We also met their other vendor Cotton Country Jams who create their marmalade and jams on the sandwiches. Yum and Bravo!

I definitely recommend checking this spot out and supporting an awesome cause! I will be a regular, as this will be one of my neighborhood favorites!"}
{"text":"First time checking out an Even Stevens sandwich shop and had a great experience! When you walk in you're greeted by many (maybe all?) of the staff, which is nice but unexpected- nothing wrong with that. I ordered their banh mi with pork belly, hubby had the cubano. Hubby devoured his sandwich. The banh mi was visually appealing and really tasty but too saucy for me. My husband tried it too and he said it was like a very wet bbq sandwich with some pickled veg on top. I've had many banh mi sandwiches and they're never dripping with soy sauce. That being said, it was still pretty tasty and definitely a flavor bomb. If I order it again I think I'll ask them to go easy on the sauce if possible. The sandwiches are also pretty big so come hungry! They also have a good kids menu (my little one had a yummy grilled cheese with some veggie sticks and a juice box). 

Overall I'd give it 4.5 stars. The space is clean, open, inviting, and fun; the staff members are super friendly (I think we were checked up on maybe 4? times while eating) and the food is tasty and filling. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great vibe, super yummy sandwiches. Fast and friendly service. I had the Turkey Day and it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is fine for what it is.  Decent sandwiches, great cause, and a neat setting.

Staff was okay.  They were sitting at a table, quickly took my order, then returned to sitting and chatting with the other work friends.  

Nothing special about the sides.

For a place with rave Yelp reviews, I don't get this one.  Maybe it's for the cause, which many other businesses do as well without making a spectacle on their walls about."}
{"text":"Great variety of sandwiches + Fresh ingredients + Friendly Staff = great place.

I like the Turkey Day and Sprang Chicken.

Plus, they have tater tots!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Even Stevens and my experience was very different than my previous time. I think this may have been a one off, but really unhappy with my experience. The customer service was great and the staff very friendly but I ended up having an issue with my food. I ordered their breakfast burrito, the new morrissey. 

When I took a bite, the food tasted a little weird. I don't like the taste of papaya and it smells pretty bad to me so I told myself there was probably papaya in my burrito (I was really hungry). I ended up just scarfing down half the burrito, ignoring the weird smell and taste (yea not a good idea, that's on me). Later when I went to eat left overs I was really having trouble getting the \"papaya down.\" I finally asked bae if he liked papaya and when he took a look, he said he didn't think it was papaya. That's when I got a little freaked out and called the restaurant. They said they had not put papaya in the burrito. They put carrots in there. 

Uh oh, whatever the orange mushy stuff was in my burrito, it didn't taste like carrots. It smelled weird and tasted weird. I thought maybe they had a funky sauce on them but nothing else in the breakfast burrito smelled or tasted like the carrots so couldn't have been vinegar or kimchi. The carrots were also mushy so definitely think there was something up. 

Thank goodness I didn't get sick, but I'm upset that the restaurant sold spoiled food and a little confused how they served the burrito like that. The carrots were pretty stinky.  After that experience, I will not be going back to Even Stevens again, unfortunately because enjoyed my first experience there and think they have a cool space.

During my phone call with them when I figured out there was no papaya in the burrito and was telling them I thought their carrots had gone bad, I did not feel like they were taking me seriously. When I finally talked to the manager he apologized and said \"they were there for me\" not sure what that means. But didn't offer to refund me for the food or take any action to show that they felt bad or wanted to help. Hopefully no one else has an experience like this."}
{"text":"While ordering, I felt rushed and almost like an inconvenience because there's no details on the sandwiches or any other item on the menu. But the only question I asked the front cashier was \"what cookies do you do have?\" Because them selling those isn't posted at all but I received a free one for checking in on yelp. I spent $14 on a drink, sandwich, and Mac n cheese. Not really an issue except that the turkey day was extremely average almost as if my mother had made it for a school lunch. The Mac n cheese was literally lukewarm, basically equal to the room temperature, if not below. I went to an event at the Van Buran after this and while just standing there my stomach begun to hurt very badly. Something was just not correct with this meal. I really regret spending the money I did on a poor meal like this. I was very disappointed by the overall service and food quality."}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times since we live right down the street. Last time we went on a Sunday morning. They had $5 mimosas and a live band. It was a very fun place to hang out for brunch in the neighborhood and the breakfast burritos are too die for. I went back 5 days later to get them to go for dinner again! Absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out by just wondering the area because I had gotten tired of the places around it. I Can't tell you how many times I've been here ever since the first time and it's been an amazing experience every time. I've tried out their breakfast burritos and sandwiches to their lunch sandwiches, they even have some French toast if you're feeling something with a little sweetness. Well I can say that each meal is made to perfection,  the sauce that they make themselves is absolutely delicious and I recommend asking for it if your meal doesn't come with it already.

The staff is incredibly friendly checking up on you if you need anything extra. Highly recommend trying if your looking for a great tasting brunch or lunch!"}
{"text":"Came for a few meetings over breakfast. This place is super friendly with its staff and serves great food. Had the sausage breakfast sandwich that came with tater tots. The tots were the perfect throwback addition to the well made breakfast sandwich. Free wifi and ample electrical outlets AND free flowing diet coke will make this place my new client meeting place for downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Great find for excellent sandwiches. Several vegan options available. We had the hummus sandwich and the jackfruit sandwich and both were delicious. Friendly staff. Look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  It was GREAT!!! The staff was funny and helpful.  Anything you should choose to eat, you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Fresh and flavorful sandwiches! Great location and excellent customer service! Don't miss out on the tater tots or the Sloppy Joe!"}
{"text":"Visiting from CA. So excited to try this place since the reviews were so positive and the Even Stevens nostalgia in the name was kinda cute, but not too much good to say. The hostess(?)/server seemed bored and despondent and put out to hand us paper menus - and didn't seem to really want to explain how the place worked. My BF asked if the weather was unusual (it was raining and we are from Ca) and she literally looked at him with a blank stare and said \"I don't know\". Did she just arrive from somewhere else into Phoenix and this was Day 1 on the job? 

Ordered our food and found a seat with our number and when the food came she brought no silverware - which was not located at the help yourself counter so had to find her again and ask for some. The burritos had so much cheese (and trust you me, I love cheese) that they were inedible and there was so much grease that the tortilla was soggy. We ate less than 1/2 each and just left.

TBH, the vibe seemed very sort of hipster, proud of themselves and more concerned with being cool than actually taking care of the people spending money - great that they give in the community but that money should come from giving everyone spending their money a positive experience. 

Too bad, the inside is cute and has potential - hopefully they take care of others better than they took care of us.

**Update 5/4/17: the person who commented below reached out to me for my email to make amends, but never emailed. I messaged her a month later to follow up, still no response to date. Seems on par with the initial visit - all hat, no cowboy."}
{"text":"The food was good and the workers make the experience even better. They had a life size connect four and the chef on his break was cutting up with us while we were playing. On our way out I saw a trash can and was going to throw my food away and the other worker there said \"oh no, don't you worry about that, you come here, and eat and enjoy, that's our job to clean up\". I like that she stopped us and made us feel even more special being there."}
{"text":"An absolute five-star breakfast sandwich. Don't worry about the extra $1 for the pork belly, just get it and get the eggs medium. Gooey egg plus savory pork and maple glazed bread equals a wild mix of flavors in every bite, especially if you get some of the house sauce on the side. I've found my new favorite breakfast sandwich in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"BEST stuffed French toast I've ever had! Staff was super friendly. Live music playing. Loved this place!"}
{"text":"Only my second time here and both experiences were on point. 

The stuffed French toast is amazing. The mimosas are delicious. Breakfast burrito with the Siracha sauce is extremely good. 

The atmosphere is very laid back with couch seating if you prefer. Very relaxing atmosphere. 

They have $3 mimosas on Sunday's with Live music. And the best part is for every sandwich sold they donate a sandwich to a local non profit. 

I will be back."}
{"text":"Steven Steven let's be even. Your lovely sandwiches need to be eaten. 

I have been to this little sandwich shop several times now and have not been disappointed. 

The decor and the atmosphere is that of a 70s vibe.  Someone mentioned Austin powers and that's exactly what it's like. I personally like it. It's different. It's unique and welcoming. 

They serve beer which is also very different and a very welcoming. 

The sandwiches I have tried so far have all been good with no complaints. They are inventive and absolutely delicious. 

No complaints from me and this is why they get 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have been to several of their locations and love them all. The party tots and capreezy sandwich is so delicious. Mac & cheese bites are yummy. The chopped salad has potato chips in it, FYI. That might not be okay with some people. I would go here than another restaurant. You can get a lot of food here for $10 for one person, more food than other restaurants. I would definitely return the next time I'm nearby!"}
{"text":"This place is unique.  I have driven by it a few times and decided to stop by.  I ordered a sandwich and it was really good.  I want to say maybe it was Cuban variant.  The sandwich had really good flavor.  The sandwich was huge too.  I was only able to eat half of it also.  Plus I tried a beer there that had a orange blossom flavour too.  It was really tasty.  I can not wait to eat at this place again and try a different sandwich."}
{"text":"Walking distance from my office and a great place to grab a sandwich. So far I've tried the Banh Mi and the Miami Vice Cuban sandwich. The food is fresh, tasty, and fast. Service is friendly and the place is very clean with lots of options for places to sit, table, couch, lounge chair, etc. Plus it's cool that they give back to local charities.

Too many places treat lunch sandwiches as just a throw-away item on the menu but Even Stevens gives them the care they deserve.

Check it out, you might even run into me there :-)"}
{"text":"This place is fast and friendly! I'm here no manger than 10 mins. The staff is nice and friendly. The food here is amazing and and they have such a great cause. You would not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly, best breakfast burrito I have ever had. Love their mission, love their location. Win!"}
{"text":"Even Stevens is dope! They donate a sandwich to various charities around the valley for every one sold. I think the hidden gem about this place is the breakfast menu. The french toast is really tasty and very cheap! The breakfast burrito is fantastic also."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch, I'm not a big sandwich person at all. Like I totally despise jimmy johns and cheba but lol But this was the best sand which I've ever had!! 

I got the turkey day and bravo tots. The bread was nice and crips but not hard. And the dressings they put in it was sweet and tangy loved it! 

Next time I want the tots with gauc and all that fancy stuff I see people post lol."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and even better food! Can be pricey but they donate food for each sandwich you buy."}
{"text":"Went here with my dad this morning for some breakfast as I heard they had some delicious vegan options. I ended up ordering the vegan breakfast burrito called The New Morrissey! It consisted of Mexican soyrizo, marinated tofu, tots, roasted veggies and a house made garlic brava! It wasn't very busy and my food came super quick. The restaurant was also super clean and pretty on the inside. I would definitely come back and order this again!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! This place is sooooooo good! The atmosphere is perfect for kids that don't like to sit still. The customer service is fabulous! The food is PERFECT! Love this place, games to play with the fam who you eat too. Totally chill. I'd highly recommend the JP grilled cheese and the stuffed French toast. Awesome! And they GIVE BACK! You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Best customer service I've ever experienced in a sandwich shop and great sandwiches to boot. Also, every sandwich you buy also provides one for someone across the globe."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast one day as we were exploring the neighborhood... and I have to say we were pleasantly surprised... !

I had a breakfast burrito, my gal had the stuffed waffles and her sister had the breakfast sandwich... all pretty tasty!

The service is similar to what you'd expect at Liberty Market, up the street - you order at the register and the food arrives at your table.

What's great about this place is the value... very affordable given what is in the surrounding area and I often wonder how places in the Gilbert Historical District will survive given the amount of really good places to eat down there - this is one that might make it given the pricing and the value... and is worthy of your time. 

It's location isn't ideal as you can't see it from Gilbert Rd... and it's behind some really great places... but if you turn in and look around behind some of the flashy places on the street - this is one that's worth your while."}
{"text":"This was a chill sandwich spot! The restaurant inside looked like a hipster hotel lobby lol. I ordered the pot roast sandwich & it was good! The bread was baked just right for me because it was tender & wasn't too crunchy to dip it in the au jus sauce. The workers were hella nice. Knowing how hot it was over here compared to California, enjoying the food to the air conditioning on super full blast was lovely! I Couldn't complain about this joint!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Ruben sandwich I've ever had. Seriously. Get it. The beef was sooo tender-buttery even. People here are very friendly, service was quick and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Friendly employees. Oh and this sandwich is bomb.com!  The sausage in the breakfast sandwich is flavorful and real. It's sad that I have to point that out in Arizona, but there are still some restaurants that didn't get the memo. I'll definitely be back for more. Goodbye weekday cereal (for breakfast at least)."}
{"text":"Five of us stopped by for lunch on Saturday...unfortunately my initial excitement for Even Stevens took a quick turn to disappointment. I'll do my best to keep it short and sweet. 

Everything was undercooked. Food comes right from the kitchen to the tables and we dug in as soon as it arrived. Nothing that was supposed to be warm was which makes me question how hot food is being held...I guarantee it's at the wrong temp. I'm hoping this is not the norm and maybe it was just an off day. 

The Sprang Chicken had undercooked bacon. Personally, I prefer soft bacon (I'm the only person I know who likes soft bacon) but my friend who ordered the sandwich was not impressed and had to take it off. Strike one.
The gouda on the gouda sandwich (not sure the real name) was not melted. Strike two.
The Party Tots were cold...it was just like eating a cold french fry. The cheese was not warm and they were flavorless. Strike three.
The Brava Tots have garlic aioli that was also flavorless, therefore it's just mayonnaise for the most part. Tots were also cold. Strike four. 
Finally, the Bahn Mi had pork that you could not bite in to. I took it out of the sandwich to look at it and couldn't even tear the pork apart. I've never experienced anything like that ever. Lucky for me, they exchanged my sandwich and I got the Caprese sandwich which was actually really good. Out of five things, that was the best and I would recommend that.

As for the people and the atmosphere, the shop was relatively clean and everyone was really nice. We were able to donate some non-perishable food that we had with us, and when I got my drink I realized that I really wanted coffee so I asked if there was a price difference and the girl working the front said that they actually give free coffee to students which is pretty cool. I would give the concept of the restaurant a 5 out of 5 but on this day they just couldn't deliver on quality."}
{"text":"I had always walked by this place and decided, one day, to eat here. The Sloppy Joe sandwich caught my attention. The best Sloppy Joe ever!!! This is all I get here! I hear the company is trying to do away with the Sloppy Joe. It would be detrimental, if they do. Great customer service! Definitely a go to!"}
{"text":"Went to Even Stevens for the first time today with a friend and it is the perfect place to go get a nice lunch or breakfast! I ordered their Mac and cheese and it was super tasty the quality of it was by far the best I've ever had. My friend ordered their breakfast sandwich with ham and said he highly recommends it as well, it even came with tots on the side which were lightly seasoned and had a nice crunch to it. Very nice environment to be around!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for brunch. Love that there is endless French toast on Sundays..so good!  My husband had bfast burrito and he said it was one of the best ever!! We'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches AND you give back to the community! I highly recommend this yummy Chandler eatery"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere, the place is very clean and the grad breakfast burrito was very good.  The staff was fast and efficient. If I am back this way again I would gladly come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Congratulations, Evens Stevens, you are the only Utah-based chain that I truly like. The food is all good, and I love the charitable giving of the establishment. 

A big plus for me is the availability of vegetarian options. Most sandwich places just have one veg sandwich that's basically just all their toppings and cheese. Even Stevens has jackfruit which is a wonderful but underused vegetarian substitute. Their torta is delicious especially with the pickled onions. The hummus sandwich is solid, but it's more like the typical veggie sandwiches found at other places.

The vegetarian breakfast burrito with soyrizo is a delight, and I promise meat eaters will like it as well. Many people I've talked to said they like soyrizo better than the real stuff since it's not as greasy. The marinated veggies in the burrito are tasty, but the salsa is pretty average.

I've been here a couple times with meat eaters, and they seem to really love the beef sandwich with au jus. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying a cookie since it's free with yelp check-in."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great! Want yummy food, great customer service, a laid back environment, and doing it all for a great cause? Stop looking now and come get yourself some food at Evens Steven!

We arrived about an hour and a half before their closing time and stood at the front to look over their menu. There were about three other customers who were still dining in as well.

The employee quickly ran over to us and asked us if we had dined in before. We told her no, and she kindly went over everything with us. 

We ended up ordering a sprang chicken sandwich with a side of their tomato soup and we also ordered a BLT salad.

We sat down and the food came out soon after. My chicken sandwich was delicious!!! The tomato soup was pretty good, but I just wish it would have been hot when I got it. It was lukewarm when it was brought out to me. The salad was the best! It was so fresh and the portion is pretty big! 

We spent close to $30 and it was well worth it. The food was great and the employees were friendly! We will definitely stop by again, and next time, I will make sure I ask for the soup to be extraaaaaa hot!"}
{"text":"Lady on the street told me to try the breakfast food here(I was on my bike). Elizbeth and I decided to try it. (Elizbeth likes the breakfast burritos at the Original Burrito Company in Awatukee, just to far to drive) This place is hidden behind the restaurant row on Gilbert road. 

Make this your next breakfast adventure!!
I had the breakfast sandwich medium eggs with ham. Omg! The ham was the star of the show! Great sandwich!
I guess you should expect great sandwiches from a sandwich shop, but these guys are going all out!
E had the 'grad' breakfast burrito and really liked it. With a little arm twisting this might be her local replacement for the Awatukee burrito she loves. I tried it and I'm sold! 

Enjoy breakfast here, you'll be happy."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.   Good food, great price, live music and an awesome cause.   Eat here"}
{"text":"I haven't been to the one in Peoria yet but the one in downtown is money!  I get the Rueben every time and it never disappoints.  Even Stevens is top 3 sandwich shops in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Took my kids to ESS yesterday and it was phenomenal! Not only was I digging the inside decor and of course the food was great but the staff was completely welcoming. ESS gives a great vibe to downtown Phoenix and it's pretty rad."}
{"text":"This place not only serves delicious breakfast and lunch all day. They also have the best employees. Mike Thank You! your amazing bubbling and glowing personality totally made my day."}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review for a reason. I have a lot of patience and understanding when it comes to restaurants being a manager of a very successful one myself. However upon sitting down at a table for a quick bite before a concert we were immediately told that they were out of a few things on the menu, which that's fine I get it, busy night. But then when we tried to order some small bites we were told no Brussels sprouts, no shishito peppers, no grilled cheese?! It's only 7pm on a Saturday! We then waited nearly twenty minutes for a small bowl of baked mac and cheese which I'm nearly positive didn't have real cheese (came out barely warm to the touch) and was topped with cold tomato slices and fatty bacon pieces and a hummus plate with pita bread that definitely wasn't freshly baked. I hope management gets with the program and realizes restaurant season is just about in full swing and if they continue having nights like this, I wish them luck. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Awesome for little kids. Plenty of games, small person table. Nice kids food menu - no junky or fried stuff. Mellow and happy, kid friendly acoustic lunchtime music. Don't fear though if you don't have tots; you can still have a pleasant lunch. No Chucky Cheese atmosphere. Very nice staff. Is the food awesome? No; it's just pretty good and healthy. Plus the charity angle is great."}
{"text":"Loving this new sandwich shop in downtown Chandler!  We've been watching and waiting for it to open.  The sandwiches are top notch!  They are fresh, unique and taste even better.  And the gluten free bread is very good!"}
{"text":"I went here with some friends and had a mixed experience but don't plan to return.

The good: my Reuben was delicious and well made. Reubens can be very messy but this one had a great corned beef and just enough sauce!

Also good: Management apologized the issues and discounted our meals for the bad stuff below.

The bad:  service was poor.  The person delivering food couldn't find the right table 2 or 3 times while I was there.  2 of the 3 others at my table had their orders come out with wrong side dishes or missing bacon.  The other sandwiches were greasy and unappetizing.  The bottomless French toast was not made right so it was dry and more a cinnamon toast than nice and soft and eggy...  The kitchen corrected all the errors but they seemed be having too many problems to want to return."}
{"text":"Just wow!!! This place is awesome!! Other than being a little new and not having a packed place, this shop gets our full approval!!! It won't be empty for long, though. Word of mouth and this place will put a dent on every other sandwich shop around here. Worth a drive, as they have a fantastic mission!!! Live music, just right atmosphere, awesome!!! Downtown Gilbert needed a place like this!!!"}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable. The sandwiches were yummy!!! I absolutely love the vibe inside. We sat outside and although its hustle bustle, it was cool to people watch while we ate."}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is amazing! Hands down the best sandwich I've ever had!! I am the biggest food snob and honestly, I don't even like sandwhiches. Before finishing the last bite we were already planning our next trip back. I was so sad to finish my food. Every time we go out to eat at a sandwhich place, I pick half the bread off and feel awful afterwards. The bread was PERFECTION!! The staff was so unbelievably awesome as well. After a very long day having a late dinner, this was the perfect night cap. Thank you for sharing your gifts with the world"}
{"text":"The food here is great! Super fast/friendly Service! And they have vegan options! Great breakfast/ brunch/lunch spot. The breakfast sandwich with pork belly is mouth watering. Plus, the vegan options arent just salads. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Jack fruit quesadilla/torta is great!"}
{"text":"My fiancé showed me this place when I visited him during Thanksgiving. I'm from So. Cal and I love food!!
I love the concept of this restaurant where when you purchase a sandwich, they donate one to a local non-profit. (If you'd like more info on how that works, check out their website!) Wishing there were more restaurants like this.

Alright, the food:
I ordered the Party Tots and the MiHAMi Vice Sandwich (essentially a cubano sandwich). 

Party tots are like a small version of nachos but with tater tots. Make sure to eat it as soon as you get it! It doesn't taste as great as it gets colder. 
The guac that was on top of it was so good! Tasted very fresh and wished I had the recipe for it! I love guac! 

The MiHAMi Vice was good as well! I only wished there was more mustard but the meats (roast pork & ham) were cooked to perfection. I hate meats that are over cooked to where you're chewing until eternity. Nope, not with their meats.

Can't wait to come back to this place the next time I visit Arizona and love the idea that I'm also helping out someone else with getting fed."}
{"text":"Nice place overall. The ordering and staff can be a bit quirky, but the atmosphere is kind of fun."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place. But i will never forget it. 

The 4 of us all ordered very different things (2 sandwiches, 1 french toast, 1 breakfast burrito). We all loved our food. It took a while to get the food, but after eating it, i understood why, a little better. 

Im sure ill be back soon , and when i do, ill add some more to this review..."}
{"text":"One of the best shops with customer service and amazing eats! Trevor and all the staff always take care of me when I come thru! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great casual atmosphere and super delicious food. Options for all from sandwiches to salads to Mac and cheese. Very friendly service and wouldn't hesitate to return"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. They have something for meat eaters and vegans, which made this vegetarian very happy. The seating is awesome, very retro. And they have retro family games to play. The menu items are affordable  and  they  have a vegan gluten free whoopie style cookie. Yas!!! My boys ate and played rock'em sock'em robots. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito was delicious! My mother got the stuffed French toast, everything was delicious. The service here is great. We were visiting from California, glad I found this place."}
{"text":"Met for lunch here last Sunday. The place has a coffeehouse vibe. A young woman played guitar and sang. She was good. The service was very good and friendly. Made us feel welcome.
I had the grilled cheese with jalapeños and a side salad. The sandwich was GREAT, and the Salad was surprisingly fresh. There were 4 of us, and everything was fresh and tasty. Definitely recommend it, and going back again. Food was delicious and music too.."}
{"text":"Um......no.  

The girl taking my order was nice, but short of that it was a big waste of time and money. Took them 15 minutes to make my sandwich, which was piled high with lettuce. Very little turkey and all kinds of different liquids that just made it a soggy mess. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Do not get the breakfast items to go - somehow the quality always suffers as I learned on my last visit. The best option is to dine-in and order the breakfast sandwich. It was totally on point with a great roll, a hint of maple and crisp bacon with an egg patty. Sometimes, the tater tots are under cooked, but they got it right this time. The only issue is cream situation when you order coffee. You have to ask the register girl for the cream and she is usually busy doing something, but the coffee is still pretty good."}
{"text":"Had a delicious turkey sandwich with side salad. Live music on a Sunday afternoon was good too."}
{"text":"I went to the Scottsdale location and ate the Cuban sandwich. OMG it was one of the best sandwiches I've had in years. Kids meals are great to for the price: $5 for ham and cheese sandwich , sliced strawberries and banana and milk. I can't recommend the Cuban sandwich enough"}
{"text":"This place was great! I am gluten and dairy free and they were able to accommodate me very well. I had the Banh Mi with a salad and my mom had the spicy grilled cheese. Mine was delicious, lots of flavor and the gluten free bread was think and soaked up all the juices from the pork resulting in a delicious sandwich! My mom loved her spicy grilled cheese. She said it was pretty darn spicy though so if you are not into spice it might be best to avoid. The reason for the 4 stars is because it is pretty expensive. Compared to most sandwich shops this place is like eating at a fancier lunch spot. My moms grilled cheese was $9.25! Overall the atmosphere is great. The people who were working there were super nice and we had a really good lunch!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Overpriced, and only a few salad choices. They claim to pride themselves on healthy choices and solicitation of donations. They give you ice burg lettuce (zero nutritional value) and very sub-par service for what you pay for. This is a bad idea if you want health for both you and your wallet. I'm done, despite the close proximity to my office."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came here last night for a takeout order since we were in the area and it was around 9:00 p.m. We have been to the location in Tempe and enjoyed our meals there so we decided to give this location a try. 

When we went inside, one of the employees was vacuuming the place and the place was dead. The location is a bit tucked away so maybe people don't know it's here yet. 

I was craving something sweet so I went with the stuffed french toast. My fiance went with the sausage breakfast burrito. When the food was ready, it came in two separate paper bags and I thought it was odd that they handed my order to me vertically. I wasn't really sure what to expect so when we got back to the car, I ripped open the bag (it was stapled) and realized I should have been holding it horizonatally. The berry sauce that they had in a container inside my order spilled all over inside and of course, that little container smushed my stuffed french toast. 

15 minutes later, we get home and dig in. The french toast was okay but my fiance's burrito was not edible. He took one bite and spit it into the trash. I took a bite to confirm and spit it out as well. It was so weird and tasted sour. I asked him if he wanted me to call the establishment but he said no. He said he should've known better when ordering a breakfast burrito at night from a sandwich shop. 

To top it off, I was supposed to get a cookie for my Yelp check-in. They rang it in for me and all. Guess what - no cookie when I get home. Such disappointment... He was really excited to see this location and now we are just really bummed about our experience. I was going to leave 1 star for this review but because the service was nice and the establishment was clean, I'm adding another star."}
{"text":"Great vegan options! I have had the veggie sandwich and the Jack fruit one as well, both very yummy. Always clean and fast service. Price isn't bad either."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal here, all 7 of us. My three kids loved the mac and cheese and kettle chips. The rest of us had various sandwiches and salad. All of us really enjoyed what we ordered. Love that they give back to those in need."}
{"text":"We went for a late brunch and ordered the breakfast burrito! It was delicious. The atmosphere really added to the overall experience and the staff is accommodating and so friendly. They have a great cause and we can't wait to go back to enjoy some drinks and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Awesome, fast, reasonably priced, sizable sandwiches. $2 devil's ale cans, and Van Halen hot for teacher playing through the speakers. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"A place I have never heard of before until this afternoon popped up on my Yelp search list of \"Restaurants in my area\" and after reviewing other's experiences, I'm glad I had the opportunity to stop over to Even Stevens Gilbert.

Upon walking in, you're going to be greeted by a very hipster and open area. Don't let it scare you, it is welcoming once you step in more. The aroma of the Tomato Bisque will have you drooling. You order at the counter and take a seat. As you anxiously await for your food, you have some time to appreciate the atmosphere; one that you won't find anywhere else. Hipster, fun, very \"edgy\" but not an awkward California-Surfer-Dude-Edgy, a good edgy.

Then, the food comes.

I had the Sprang Chicken, Tomato Basil Bisque and a free cookie, compliments of my Yelp check-in. The Sprang Chicken was incredible. Not too overpowering of flavors, just a perfect combination of chicken to cheese to avocados to tomatoes. It was incredible. The Tomato Basil Bisque was some of the best I've ever had. Not too Tomato-y and not bland, it was a different kind of different, most definitely worth the $4.95 price tag, that soup was made by God himself it seemed like.

The place was clean, the service was extremely friendly and helpful and the food was great. All in all, a great first-time experience. I'll most certainly be back when I'm nearby.

Thank you, Mr. Even Steven. Thank you."}
{"text":"Four stars for the food and three stars for the service. The food is amazing and I very much appreciate anywhere that has vegan options. Its not something I would recommend for work lunch because it takes about 1/2 an hour just to get your food which leaves you 10 minutes to scarf it down if you have a 10 minute commute. Staff aren't that helpful with questions either. But they donate a lot to charity so I figure that forgives quite a bit."}
{"text":"It was ok for their second month being open. I first tried to order the stuffed French toast with berries but they were out of the bananas that come on it so instead I got the Grad breakfast burrito with soyriso instead of meat which was very good. 

I also ordered a mimosa and paid for it before they told me they were out of champagne. So they gave me a beer which was cheaper than what I paid for the mimosa. 

We also got party tots and they looked amazing but they were just kind of warm and tasted like they had been sitting out for a while. Even the melted cheese that was on top was dry and I know that wouldn't happen if they were freshly made. 

The atmosphere is pretty cool though and they have some good board games so we played some games and had a good time. And the staff is super nice. The food needs improvement though. I would have given 2 stars if the staff hadn't been so nice but they earned the extra star."}
{"text":"I love that this is a place to eat with a cause more than just filling my belly with good food!  Each location donates a sandwich to local charities in the same city. I love this!  We came for lunch and it was packed. I ordered a lunch combo, 1/2 sandwich, 1/2 salad and a drink for $9.95.  I had the Reuben and it was so delicious, tasty rye bread from local Noble Bread, crispy red cabbage kraut and not too overloaded with sauce.  The salad had fresh blueberries and granola over field greens with a very yummy vinaigrette dressing. If you are a fan of tater tots try them party style with bacon and avocado! They also offer breakfast too which I hope to try out soon."}
{"text":"Shout out to Chasity for making our visit to Even Stevens 5 stars! She was extremely patient, gave suggestions, and was very accommodating. She went out of her way to give excellent service and was happy to do so. I work in the service industry, so customer service is extremely important to me. Chasity exceeded my expectations (good customer service is hard to find these days) and we will definitely be returning. Oh, and THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS TOO! The entire staff here seems awesome. Great team, great time, great food! What more could you ask for??"}
{"text":"Been here three times. Food is good but when you have a line out the door at lunch and only one person taking orders it kind of kills the experience. Y'all need to figure this out ASAP!!"}
{"text":"I expected this place to be good, but was still pleasantly surprised when I tasted my sandwich. I had the turkey one and really liked the combo of the savory meat and cheese with the sweetness of the jam!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my kids while visiting for the weekend. It was literally around the corner from our hotel. The kids found sandwiches they liked. I had a beet salad, which really could have used more beets. 

The service was really great and friendly and I like the mission of the organization. Would go back"}
{"text":"Delish!  I was in a party of 12 and we ordered and had our sandwiches in no time.  Everything tasted amazing!  The Mihami Vice Cubano especially was the bomb."}
{"text":"Had the Ruben sandwich which was fantastic, Brussel sprouts were awesome as well! Great price friendly service. All wins, cant wait to try something new."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite breakfast burritos!!!!  I got the undergrad with avocado.  I'm not sure what is in the sauce, but it is delicious!!!  The tater tots were so great inside the burrito....yum!!!  

The kids got the grilled cheese and the cold turkey sandwiches and they were both big portions and the kids loved them!! 

We will be back!  

Mario was a real pleasure to talk to!"}
{"text":"We went for the first time the other night, because well who wants to cook when it's 120 degrees outside, or eat hot food? Not me!
Their restaurant is spacious, light and bright , order up at the counter and chill kind of place! I love the choice of music that played in the background, the books and games on the tables and even a few toys and benches that give this place a welcoming relaxed family atmosphere.
I ordered the Brussels sprouts, they were a tad bit too toasted but the bits of bacon and maple glaze made them so delicious that I had to fight for every bite as my kid's fork kept diving in after my bacon!  I also ordered the Turkey day sandwich, turkey, cran-peno(cranberry-jalapeno) jelly, Havarti, roasted tomato spread, greens, cucumbers on French bread, with a salad......so good! 
My mini me ordered the JP Grilled cheese stuffed with cream cheese, white cheddar and garlic roasted jalapenos on French bread, it was a melted masterpiece! The only thing that could have made it better was a bowl of tomato soup and a cool weather day!
Not only is the food delicious but Even Stevens partners with local business, Peixoto coffee, Noble bread, Cotton Country Jellies, and San Tan Brewery and 4 local non-profits to help feed the community hence the name. This is one place where you're money goes further and we'll be back often!
 At Even Stevens every time a sandwich is purchased the community prospers and a soul is fed!"}
{"text":"Even Steven Peoria does not disappoint. The Miami Vice (aka Cuban) was as delicious as I remembered. Slow roasted, melt in your mouth pork, tasty and savory ham served up on a toasted roll, cheese, mustard and pickle spears, this is their Cuban sandwich. Fabulous!

We chose the chips, but they also have a great side salad with a tangy vinaigrette if you want lighter fare.

Do check in with Yelp because they offer a free large cookie. The sugar cookie is AMAZING!

Service was friendly and each sandwich also helps you give back to the community. This is a very socially conscious company!"}
{"text":"What a cool concept! For every sandwich that is sold, a sandwich is donated to one of the non-profits that they work with. 

When you walk into this place, you place your order and they give you a number to place on your table of choice. I went with the Sprang Chicken sandwich with chips, my sister went with the Do Gouda with tomato bisque, her roommate got the sloppy joe with tomato bisque and my boyfriend went with the Do Gouda.

I enjoyed my sandwich thoroughly - I wish there was an option for something more than chips or salad as a side. Maybe an option to pay more and get sweet potato fries or small side of tots? 

We ordered the party tots to share and I was not impressed but it was nice to have some thing to share with the table. When we got this plate, it was barely warm... Speaking of temperatures, the tomato bisque was barely warm as well. We had them reheat it for us. By the way, tomato bisque is the only soup available there.

If we're in the area and are looking for a quick sandwich spot that supports a good cause, we'll come here. In the meantime, I have some other places in Tempe bookmarked that I still need to try!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute  & delicious ! I enjoyed chatting with Jason the GM - love the concept how they really do help the Community. 

Yummy food & great vibes ! I can't wait to come back ...a lot !"}
{"text":"Good good and quick service. It's VERY noisy. Couldn't hear anything my husband said. Also, who doesn't have half and half gor coffee?  Matt doesn't. They only serve milk! Big disappointment! Coffee tastes much better with cream.  Can't stand it with milk!"}
{"text":"So fun. Me and my girlfriend like this place. The beef dip sandwich is crazy good! Love their cool 1970's theming. Makes them stand out as a sandwich shop. Also, they give away a truckload of sandwiches to non-profits which is extra cool. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Had the brunch special...unlimited french toast and a mimosa. And a cup of water. The french toast tasted like it had been cooked at about 7 that morning. I could hardly even cut it. The water container was empty and not very impressed at all with the food. The mac and cheese tasted like one I could make.  The music was good though and so was the help. Everyone was quite attentive."}
{"text":"Stopped here at 7 am on Monday morning before hitting the train to Tempe. Let me start by saying this is a great brunch/lunch spot. They have 3$ mimosas and 7-9$ sandwiches. 

It goes to a good cause because they donate food each time you order a sandwich.

Moving on the the meal itself, I had a mimosa and a Mahami Vice, which is a Cubano. 

Cubano includes ham, beef, pickles, and mustard, comes with either chips or a mixed green salad.

Other than being a little bit dry, the sandwich was a large portion and was a great breakfast! 

It's a really laid back joint, the service is good, and they have study and small casual meeting spaces available.

If you're looking for a good sandwich with a good cause this is the place."}
{"text":"Wtf... 10+ dollars for a sandwich.. huh? It's tiny! What.. I'm super confused. I feel ripped off.

Well.. at least they have craft beer! 

Oh wait.. no taps? Damn.. 

Cans only.. 

I'll stick with Heidi's and jersey mikes. 

I will give them 2 stars because they have a good cause. But wow.. priced.

Edit: not comparable prices when you get a half a sandwich. Thank you, the downtown location is better."}
{"text":"Wow!  I finally got out to visit Even Stevens!  My Aunt & Uncle were here for a visit from Illinois.  I decided to take them to a \"local\" eatery.  We were not disappointed!  
The staff were all very friendly and very welcoming!
We went in on Thursday last week.  I should have the greeters and staff names to give props due to them but I don't .  In any case they were great reps to Gilbert and the kind of friendliness I experience on the regular in my new town.   Props to Gilbert and the infectious nature of kindness that is one of the things I absolutely love about living here!  ! 
I ordered the Mihami Vice (Cubano). It was one of the best sandwiches I have had anywhere!  The baguette was fresh and crusty on the outside.  The flavors were fresh and the meat very tasty!  Price for sandwich with choice of salad or chips $9.25.  
Even Stevens donates and partners with 4 different organizations for every sandwich sold which is a very cool bees  knees biz to do!  They give to community organizations to help feed individuals  and children that have fallen on difficult times!  (See pic) the 4 organizations are in the pic attached. 
My Aunt and Uncle split the Reuben and raves about it!  
We all enjoyed our visit immensely!  
Btw love the logo!  This is a great restaurant and community support concept that other restaurants could follow suit to support people in need."}
{"text":"We got the JP grilled cheese... wow!! Let me tell you... the grilled cheese is amazing!!!! Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches for a great cause. Eclectic but enjoyable atmosphere. This is a casual dining experience, so don't go expecting something other than that."}
{"text":"Great service. Went with what staff recommended pot roast dip. Delicious!! Super friendly staff and every sandwich they sell they donate a sandwich to local charity! Very cool"}
{"text":"I've been to this location 3 times in the last two weeks and I will probably be here many more times. Their online order and pick up system is very simple to use and helps you skip lines. The sandwiches are a tad on the expensive side but worth it in quality in my eyes. Get the garlic aoli it's Delish. My favorite Sandwhich is the Rueben, solid."}
{"text":"Both the sandwiches and the salads are very tasty. The atmosphere at Even Stevens is so lively and refreshing."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches with a side of charity. They are a small chain with a few locations in the area. I usually go with the turkey day sandwich but I've had others that are good too."}
{"text":"Ok, let's talk about this place. It's bomb. com. I got the breakfast sandwich. Instead of it having ham on it, I switched it out for turkey and I had them substitute whole egg for egg whites. The sandwich has like a sweet maple glaze that they brush the bun with and it was soooooo good. It was like a sweet and savory sandwich. The sandwich also came along with tater tots and who doesn't like those?! They also donate food to local communities, what an amazing concept they have here. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Don't get the salads maybe? First time coming here and was sadly dissapointed with the chopped salad. The \"pork belly\" is just bacon bits. They put potato chips in the salad... Really?! Not very filling. Will try again just not a salad"}
{"text":"First of all, a huge thank you to Hector (the manager) for restoring my faith in the restaurant business!  Hector welcomed us, checked on us while we were eating, and even brought over some \"Even Stevens\" Swag when we were done eating!  This place uses local vendors as much as possible, and I have to say the food is awesome, and very reasonably priced.  If you're downtown and looking for a place that really appreciates their patrons, try Even Stevens, and if Hector is working, be prepared for some serious hospitality!"}
{"text":"This review is quite simpleBest sandwiches in all of the land!!! Like  Billy Dee Williams and colt 45....IT WORKS EVERY TIME!! I love the pork belly sandwich.!!! GET IN MY BELLY!!!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite sandwich place! I always get either the Do Gouda or the Turkey Pot Roast sandwich. They come with chips or a salad and a pickle, plus they have the custom Coke dispensers, which I love! Try the turkey pot roast without red onion or the jalapeno jelly, add the onion marmalade! It is amazing, especially with the au jus. The atmosphere is eclectic and laid back, plus they do all you can eat french toast for brunch on Sundays with live music! And trivia nights on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Yummy! We both enjoyed our sandwiches and everyone was very friendly. They forgot the onions on my sandwich and the jalapeno spread was a little heavy, but overall - my sandwich was great! We also got the specialty tots, nothing special."}
{"text":"Vegetarian breakfast burrito was good. Great prices. All you can eat French toast on Sundays. Really cool looking place and a great cause giving food and jobs back to the community."}
{"text":"Meh... just really meh, my sandwich was greasy and my girlfriend didn't think her sandwich was very good either. The staff is the only reason this place gets two stars. Over the top nice, however we ordered two sandwiches and a side salad, to go, and it took 25 min to get our food. The when we got home we enjoyed finding out instead of a salad they gave us over salted chips. I see them trying to be hip and different, but you need the food to be tasty as well. Disappointing first try, hope they figure it out."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have a nice menu with a good amount of sandwiches and other items. There is 100+ flavor coke machine as well! The place is decorator with a lot of fun stuff and bright colors. I tried the Mihami Vice, which was a warm sandwich, and it was sooooo good! Got to try out the party tots as well. It had avocado and jalapeños on it! 

The staff were really passionate about the company and why they do. Service is pretty fast too. They donate the cost of every sandwich they sell to charity. There are about four different charities that they work with. They do this in every community that they have stores in.

They originated in Utah and have been expanding.

This location is on bell and has a lot around it but there is plenty of parking. Shouldn't have to walk too far, even on a busy night.

Everyone, go try this place out! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches AND they support the community! Love it!  What a great concept but the food....YUM!"}
{"text":"Love the JPs grilled cheese! Fun vibe with charitable aspect, board games, and delicious cookies!"}
{"text":"This place is confusing. Walked in and didn't know if you seat yourself, order somewhere, or what. No one acknowledged us, so finally we walked to the front to order. I highly recommend that they put a clear expectations of what the customer should do. 

The food is so-so. The service was awkward. They have mimosas on the menu. When. I went to order one the Cashier stated they don't have mimosas. On the plus side they have live music on Sundays. The musician was really good. They also donate a sandwich to a local charity for every sandwich bought. 

 This is not a restaurant I would be dying to visit again."}
{"text":"Went there Sunday after the race.  Ordered a grilled cheese sandwich (GF).  When it came it was cold, I told the GM that was working.  I brought the sandwich to him and he told me he was sorry.  He then turned around and went back to speaking to someone in the kitchen.  

I was very disappointed in the service and the general disregard for the product that they produced.  Won't be back.  Can't really give any stars, didn't get a chance to eat anything.

I messaged the business on Sunday in the afternoon, but no response."}
{"text":"What a awesome find, thank you again YELP! Decor is amazing, but wait coors golden beer a dollar all the time! Whoa! They have toys and blocks for the kids, couches to launch, inside and outside seating with patio overseen downtown... can't beat it! I got the Mihami vice and it was so good, my husband had the breakfast burrito and it was delish I loved everything we had! Good job we really enjoyed this place!"}
{"text":"Even Stevens soft opening was a blast.  Just a quick background Even Stevens started out in Utah with several locations and even Boise, ID....Now have hit the ground running here in Gilbert!  Love the aesthetic on the their interior design.  Huge space that's like quirky vintage chic with a modern hipster flair.  Now onto the food........

I went with the pot roast dip.  The really nice employee recommended it saying if you closed your eyes and ate it you might not even know it was turkey.  That got my attention so I jumped on it!  Great recommendation!  Jalapeño Jam gave it just enough sweetness to balance the  well seasoned roasted turkey and the jus for dipping was supreme as well.  I would've subbed out the raw onions for pickled onions which I didn't realize are available until looking over the entire menu after I had ordered.  A 4 star sandwich cause that dark turkey meat could've given any pot roast from a traditional French Dip a run for its money!  

For any peeps on a celiac diet....Chef Brandon who previously had worked in fine dining in UT had mentioned that it's not officially on their menu yet but they they are now offering GF bread from local AZ bakery Gluten Free Creations.  So it is available to sub out for the breads on all their sandwiches!  

The highlight for me during this event was meeting wo passionate ladies who were on hand promoting their products.  The small batch jams from Cotton Country Farms which can be found in three of Even Stevens' sandwiches like my pot roast dip.   Amanda was quick to educate me on the differences between jam and jelly.  All their products are jams.  On their menu at Even Stevens they were listed as a \"jalapeño jelly\" or even a \"onion marmalade\" which should be corrected on their menu since they are jams!!! dare I say Jam Oh Jam!!!.  I'm copping some of that onion jam for sure at a future farmers market or the Phx Public Market!

Julia from Peixoto Coffee was on hand with complimentary bags of their freshest single origin roasted on 10/3 in Chandler.  I can't wait to brew this with my aeropress and chemex to compare the body of the chocolatey notes.  Always inspiring to meet someone that left Corporate America to continue the family legacy.   Definitely would've considered featuring them in my past life in the Coffee Sub Box Space.  Can't wait to visit their coffee bar now that I know about they are a player amongst other third wave roasters.  

Overall, a very well thought out and organized \"sneak peek\" by Michael and the rest of the Even Stevens management team.  A++++"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. As soon as we walked in, I loved the decor! Casual with a variety of seating options. We were greeted with a  warm, welcoming smile and  told to sit wherever we want. The sandwiches we wonderful and perfectly toasted. The saucy tots were nice and crispy with 3 very good sauces. The \"baked\" mac and cheese wasn't really \"baked\" (a little runny for our taste) but still good! (My husband still ate every bite!) All in all, I highly recommend it! And we will be back! Maybe next time I'll bring a book and hang out a while! (Oh! And they give back to the community! Another great reason to come here!)"}
{"text":"Genuine and enthusiastic employees that really seem to care about the food they make! The dining room itself is so cool with the industrial/Victorian tables and seating and a mix of eclectic signage. 

We got the Cubanos and the Pretzels with beer cheese and the peanut butter cookie. The sandwiches are enormous and more than worth the price. You get a choice of chips or salad the chips were crisp and fresh kettle chips and the dressing on the salad is killer. The Cubanos rival authentic Cubanos without the plancha pressing it down. 


Dat bread tho. Oh my god the bread is so good. Fountain drinks are the new style coke machine that puts out that amazing fresh flavor and the Ice tea is the best in the area. And we've been to every restaurant in the surrounding blocks. 

Keep up the amazing work guys! We'll be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"We actually visited Even Stevens because we did a wine & paint nite @ the location. Upon entering we were greeted immediately and the waitress explained how to order. We got a couple awesome San Tan Brewery beers & took our seats. We ordered a couple grilled cheese sandwiches with a starter of hummus and pita/veggies. The grilled cheese were amazing! I loved their jalapeño spin on it! The service was great and the location is trendy and comfortable with some games @ the table that can be played. It's a bit pricey but for a good cause so I can accept it."}
{"text":"This place is super unique and the food is amazing! We got the mahami vice because they recommended it to us and it was super delicious! Even the salads were flavorful and perfect. There is also a nice hipster type atmosphere which was cool to check out! I deff recommend this place to anybody who wants a high quality sand which!"}
{"text":"I love this sandwich shop!  The service is excellent, food is very good, atmosphere is casual and fun.
The brussel sprouts are amazing! I love the Pot Roast sandwich, and the food is plentiful.
i do wish they'd put lemon slices on the beverage bar.  We always have to ask for them.
A great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and really enjoyed, the only reason I am not giving them five stars is because I ordered the Bahn Mahi and found out 10 mins after I ordered that they were out of Mahi, so got the Pork Belly. My friend got the half sandwich Capreezy and the Goat Hugger salad. Additionally, I don't drink soda so would love for them to offer iced tea (brewed preferred and green tea would be even better) apparently they have additional drinks under where they take your order but you can't see them (kinda of makes it hard to really crave something). Loved the vibe, the seating, the couch out front which we took advantage of since it was a bit chilly inside. Overall would be back to try more."}
{"text":"Yum! This is definitely one of the better chain sandwich shops. Their hot sandwiches are always my go to. Their Cubano (Mihami Vice) is by far my favorite.  

One thing I always judge sandwich shops on is their bread. Nothing ruins a sandwich like bad bread. Luckily for us, Even Steve's has top quality bread that is both crunchy and chewy just the way you want it."}
{"text":"12/1 - we received a gift card and are looking forward to checking out Even Stevens again soon!! Thanks!!

We had heard great things about this place and are VERY disappointed.  They ran out of 2 of the 3 items we wanted to try and it's not even 1pm yet!There was no sign indicating so had to choose other menu options. We had to wait a long time for our food. Bathrooms were not clean and didn't have soap in the dispensers. Hallway had empty boxes making it look dirty and cluttered."}
{"text":"I had never been to one of these restaurants before. I see we have some in our area (I'm from the Dallas area), but have never had the chance to check it out. I am glad we stumbled upon this place while visiting Phoenix. It was conveniently located close to our hotel, so we just walked right on over.

There are tons of sandwiches to choose from including vegan options (I'm not vegan, but I have a few vegan friends... And it's always hard to find restaurants that allow for us all to eat what we want). I ended up getting the JP Grilled Cheese. The cashier suggested I swap out steak for the jalapeños, but I went ahead and kept it how it was on the menu. We also ordered mimosas because they were decently priced, and they only had sweet wine.

The sandwich was greatness. Cheesy, spicy goodness. It has white cheddar and cream cheese on it. The cream cheese made it hard to keep the sandwich together as the two pieces of bread kept sliding around. Still, the flavor was very good. I think it might have even been better if I would have substituted meat for the jalapeños. My only major complaint is the bread kind of hurt the roof of my mouth because it was so toasty, but it was worth it. The mimosas were also very good and a nice size. 

Overall, the restaurant was nice, clean, and the food was delightful. I'll definitely check one out closer to home."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Had the Cuban sandwich, it was amazing!  Also tried the Bahn Mi sandwich, also very good. Comfortable atmosphere, and great service."}
{"text":"TREVOR (Employee)

So my sister and I were looking for a place to eat. We found Even Stevens, It was our first time !

Let me tell you , Right when we walked in, we were greeted by Trevor. He had such great customer service skills, did NOT make us feel out of place. 

You know that moment when you visit a new restaurant for the first time and feel pressured to pick what you will eat? Well, we didn't feel rushed at all, he also has good recommendations on what to eat, if you are new to the place that is...

Definitely will come back again !!!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich place I have ever been to! Amazing food and they donate to a good cause. Great environment too!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here. Sandwiches are above average, staff are relatively friendly, and location couldn't be better."}
{"text":"I have only had the breakfast burrito with sausage, after eating that i have been there every week for the burrito. very good!"}
{"text":"Buy a sandwich, feed someone in need.  It's not unusual for restaurants to engage in benevolent causes every so often, but shaping an entire business model around such a cause is almost unheard of.  No wonder then why Even Stevens has grown from it's Salt Lake City roots to now (as of me writing this) 10 locations in less than 3 years, including 3 locations in Arizona.  Their Downtown Phoenix location is well positioned to take advantage of the Downtown breakfast and lunch crowd as well as the growing number of nearby college students.  And yeah benevolence is great and all, but how's the food?

I made my way here after work on a Thursday afternoon.  The Downtown Phoenix location is on the southeast corner of 1st Avenue & Van Buren, just a short stroll from the ASU Downtown campus and an even shorter stroll from the main Downtown bus and light rail stations.  Despite a relatively small looking footprint on the outside, the restaurant itself is actually quite large and spacious.  Seating for easily 100 people including some couch seating as well as patio seating outside.  In fact one of the smallest components of the restaurant might well be the front counter where you order.

I'd done my homework in advance and decided I'd go with a Sprang Chicken sandwich for my first venture here.  Chicken, provolone cheese, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, cucumbers, mixed greens, and honey mustard sauce on toasted multi grain bread.  Also comes with a pickle and your choice of chips or a salad (chips for me).  Total cost including tax: $10.  Came out to my outside patio seat in about 5 minutes.  Sandwich was excellent.  Loved the texture and the crunch of the multi grain bread, chicken was cooked perfectly, and the bacon, greens, and cheese were in abundance.  I also have to say I really liked the chips.  I'm not sure which brand they used, but tasted like old school kettle chips.  Much heartier and crunchier than your average Lay's.  Big thumbs up for this creation.

Back to that whole benevolence thing.  As I mentioned, Even Stevens helps feed those in need for every sandwich you buy.  At the end of every month they tally up sandwich sales and a portion of the proceeds go to fund sandwich ingredients which are then donated to local nonprofits who then make the sandwiches and give them to those in need.  For their 3 AZ locations, Even Stevens has teamed up with Saint Mary's Food Bank for this project.  As of me writing this, over 17,000 sandwiches have been donated to the food bank.

So to recap, great sandwiches from a restaurant that shapes its business model around literally giving right back to the community.  The Downtown location in particular is a welcome addition and has sandwich options to satisfy the myriad of folks and tastes that walk and drive by this intersection everyday.  My sandwich was already delicious regardless, but its nice to eat a good meal and feel good about doing so.  And I'd imagine many will frequent here both for the food and as a thank you to business model.  Even Stevens may be a Utah creation, but the concept is sure to have a faithful following here in the valley and elsewhere."}
{"text":"What's not to like.....  great food, super cool vibe, friendly staff and they GIVE BACK to the community.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is great, the staff goes above and beyond in customer service, and the ambience is welcoming and kitschy.. what more could you ask for? 

I only tried a sugar cookie, but my friend liked her tater tots, although she said the sandwiches were much better.  While the food might be 4/5, the staff pushed our experience into 5/5 since our server, Curtis, was so friendly and kind -seriously, he is an awesome representative for Even Stevens!! I'd recommend this place for sure if you're in the area and looking for a quick and satisfying bite"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I just swung by for a quick breakfast sandwich and the atmosphere was awesome and I didn't feel strange at all eating there in my own. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with medium eggs (not scrambled) and sausage. They layered 2 parties and the 2 eggs on a yummy, soft yet toasty bun. Oh and lots of empty cheese. It came with tots which I thought was weird and when they cooled down they got stale quick. 

Overall I was very satisfied with the breakfast sandwiches and I wish I didn't live out of state or I would be coming back often for some lunch sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in town! Killer breakfast sandwiches and outstanding staff. Everything I've tried on the menu has been amazing!!"}
{"text":"Speechless. Breakfast sandwich with ham added avocado, bun was soft with the perfect crunch tater tots were crispy and delicious. I'll be dreaming about this sandwich tonight."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, so glad there is something like this in old town Gilbert now! Chill vibes, unique layout full of colour and books on the coffee tables. Joe always provides friendly service and remembers my name when I come in. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. A little pricy but delicious food. Customer service was good, not great."}
{"text":"This place is so good and supports great causes in our local community.  First time I came I had the pork belly breakfast burrito graduate style and it was one of the best breakfast burritos I have ever had.  Second trip tried the breakfast sandwich served with tots.  Again hit the spot.  Will have to try lunch next!"}
{"text":"They have an ASU student special where if you show your ID card as a sun devil you get FREE coffee w/ no purchase necessary! What a steal!"}
{"text":"First time at this Even Stevens. I arrived for lunch at 11:30 on a Wednesday and the line was 8 deep with 20 eating. It took me 15 mins to get to the register tho. 

No paper menus in sight, I had to order based on the title of the sandwich. Big miss there. I ordered the Mihami Vice and a soft drink for $11.50. It came with salad or plain kettle chips. 

My lunch arrived in 15 minutes, five minutes after the lady behind me in line got hers. Hmm, miss. 

There was really, really loud music. With the concrete floors, wood walls and plaster ceiling, it was nearly impossible to converse. For a downtown spot, another miss. 

Excellent sandwich: crusty bread, plenty of ham, pulled pork, cheese and aioli, plus pickle spears. Service was adequate but nothing notable. 

Please turn down the music!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Can't recommend it highly enough. Party Tots, Sloppy Joe, Grilled Cheese, tomato soup, Mi hami ice, I've tried them all and they are all amazing. Such awesome service and food quality. Not only that but they give back. I'm obsessed with this place times a thousand!!!"}
{"text":"You walk in and it doesn't look like much.  However it is clean and you are immediately greeted by very friendly customer service.  You order at the counter and sit and wait.  Luckily since it's almost all sandwiches, everything comes out very fast.  The first thing I noticed was the cost of the sandwiches. $10 for a capreezy sandwich and it comes with house made chips, is a little pricey but I get it's because they donate a sandwich for every one purchased.  The size of the sandwiches is a little small but flavor is on point.  My capreezy was the perfect balance of pesto and mozzarella with very fresh basil and tomatoes. We also tried the party tots but they were out of beer cheese so we didn't quite get the full experience.  They were good but the cheddar wasn't as good.  They were also out of chicken and ALL of their cookies other than their vegetarian option.  Despite this I would go back and try again for sure.  Hopefully next time they will not be out of so much stuff and we can try a few more things."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday at 2pm it wasn't busy at all. The place is looks very nice inside. We were greeted by Toby and he explained how the restaurant works and recommended a few things to try. My husband got their Cuban sandwich and I got their Turkey Pot Roast Dip. Both sandwiches came with kettle chips and a pickle, but can also be paired with a salad. Sandwiches were very tasty and well made. You can tell they put alot into it. My sandwich had very juicy tender pulled turkey. Would like to come back and try their Breakfast burrito (breakfast served all day and Sunday brunch 9am-4pm: $3 mimosas/unlimited French toast) and their other sanwiches. We are excited haha."}
{"text":"On a Family bicycle ride to down town Gilbert we stopped in Even Stevens Sandwich for lunch. We were greeted by Joe what a great guy taking time to help us order seating us and bring us our meal making everyone feel at home. The food is excellent service is great and prices are perfect. The crew works together backing each other up keeping the restaurant clean and fun for all This was my first time there but my family frequents the establishment and we will be back. To the owners of Even Steven's thank you for having people like Joe on your staff. Check out my pictures on face book and please tag yourself."}
{"text":"Cool sandwich shop.  I had the Cuban Sandwich and my wife the BLT.  Both were excellent.  We also had the tomato bisque which was delicious.  Service was fast and friendly.  We will definitely be going back to try some more menu items.  I think my next sandwich will be the Reuben.  Well done Even Stevens, an awesome break from the ordinary!"}
{"text":"I love everything from the atmosphere, friendly staff, food, culture and mission.  Not only is the food delicious but each store is committed to their community.  I don't only mean that they will buy their food and drink from local farms and manufacturers because they go even further than that.  The concept of Even Stevens is when you buy a sandwich, they will donate the ingredients for one sandwich to a local service in need, such as food banks or homeless shelters.  When we went in, only one month in, they had already donated almost 4500 sandwiches locally."}
{"text":"The food was at best ok. My fav part was the sushi ginger they incorporated into the pickled veg.. and hardly looked like pickled veg, a bit of cabbage and some super overly pickled jalapeños. The carrots pretty much non existent, oh and no cilantro so I'm not sure I would even categorize that as a ban mi!!  It's sad the food world we live in the expectation and the what people do to escape the near budget a restaurant hads to survive off of.. but hears the thing you don't take shortcuts and make really good food people want to eat... well then there is no problem at all!! A win. For everyone. Very disappointed and the fruit cup grapes and bananas like a horrible hot mess of wilted grapes and brown bananas!"}
{"text":"I love the eat give to charity idea! It was chicken day for me, and they only have one chicken sandwich, the sprang chicken. It was good but not remarkable. I can't wait to go back and try the real eye catchers! Like the vegetarian jackfruit torta sandwich! I've not had jackfruit yet! And both the mahi banh mi and the mihami vice cubano are on my short list! I'll be back for those."}
{"text":"The turkey sandwich with the cranpeno sauce was the bomb!! So glad to know their new location downtown is so close to my work!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my breakfast burrito and I was so happy that they serve breakfast all day! The decor was retro and very bright and clean. Everything tasted great and the staff was friendly. I especially enjoyed the tater tots! I really love that this place serves to support people who are in need of food!"}
{"text":"First time at Even Stevens. I arrived at 12:15 for lunch and there were 15 diners. It's on a side street, so advertising would go a long way. 

I was greeted immediately and asked if I'd been there before. I replied 'no', but he just handed me a menu and walked away. There were plenty of empty tables so I sat at one and watched what others did. 

I ordered a Pot Roast Dip and Brava Tots plus a drink. It turns out the sandwich came with salad (didn't see that part on the menu).  It all came to $13.74 but for every sandwich ordered they donate one sandwich to the needy. Cool. 

The chairs were fairly uncomfortable, being all metal, narrow and with no cushion. 

My meal arrived in about 8 mins.   There were 20 tots, which come with aioli. For the sandwich, it had a crunchy baguette, which held up well to the juicy, plentiful pot roast. The salad came with a light salad dressing. 

Definitely not my last visit."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere! Our group of six, high school students and two, adult teachers ate there on our first morning in Phoenix. There was something on the menu for everyone. We enjoyed it so much, we went there two more times on our four day stay. My only reason for not giving them five stars is because they could have done one, minor thing better in the customer service department. I didn't know the difference between the Grad and Undergrad breakfast burrito, so I asked. I was told that the description was in the menu, but she didn't hand me one. I had to get the menu myself. An excellent customer service response would have been to hand me a menu while telling me the difference between the two. Good food is great to have, but the customer service must be excellent as well. However, that minor issue didn't stop me from eating there again and again."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast burrito & breakfast sandwich, perfect tots & they give back to the community?! Perfect place to eat and do good at the same time. The atmosphere is open & clean, staff is incredibly friendly and helpful,"}
{"text":"We have been watching the construction of Even Stevens for quite some time and were excited to check out the new restaurant in our neighborhood!  We stopped in for lunch yesterday and ordered the Da gouda with salad, the Mihami Vice with salad and a side of brava tots.  The sandwiches were quite tasty, the tots were just ok (a little cold), the atmosphere is really laid back and fun and the service was pretty quick.  Some of the employees need a little more training, but it was technically their 2nd day open, so I won't hold it against them."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this newly opened place. This corner at 1st Ave & Van Buren has been vacant/unsuccessful. I think that's about to change! They serve beer, breakfast, lunch and dinner: breakfast sandwich, burrito or French Toast. Good simple sandwiches along with soup or salad. And sides- bites as they call them. And beer & wine! I had the pot roast dip- best I ever ate! It came with potato chips and a pickle slice and au jus. There is live music on weekends and an open mic starting in December- think I'll bring my guitar..."}
{"text":"Food is decent. I've only ever gotten the French toast on Sunday morning. The rating is more for the service. On a Sunday morning where everyone is ordering the same thing because of a weekly promotion, you'd think there would be French toast ready. We waited 15-20 minutes for our first serving and half an hour for the seconds. Not impressed."}
{"text":"First time at this Even Stevens Sandwiches. I arrived at 11:30 on a Super Bowl Monday and there were six other diners. Guess the students were studying?

I got the Mihami Vice (Cuban sandwich) and a drink. The machine was out of my first four drink choices, so I got lemonade. 

My lunch arrived in six minutes. The bread was nicely toasted and the cheese was melted and gooey with a good sour swiss. The side dish option of chips or salad was lame but consistent with other locations."}
{"text":"This place is fun, energetic, super friendly. I went in and did some writing while enjoying a superb sandwich and tater tots."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous sandwich shop!!! Food was super amazing and the staff is some of the friendliest in the valley!!!! I love the atmosphere and casual comfortable feel. Did I mention they have a fabulous staff! I cannot remember the sandwich name I ordered but it was the first on the menu.  Very filling and yummmy!!! They have vegan options as well. I tasted the peanut butter cookie.  Yum! Excellent iced teasorry no photo because I enjoyed that first bite so much I was absorbed in my meal!"}
{"text":"We had walked past this place while it was under construction and bookmarked it on yelp. When we saw it was open, we decided to give it a try. 

This is one of those places that you order, then find your seat. They do have a tip option when you pay at the register. Seemed a little odd since you pay and seat yourself and haven't had any service yet, but we still gave a tip. 

When we looked at the menu we weren't super thrilled with the limited options but decided to give it a try based on all the great reviews. 

My husband ordered the turkey day sandwich. He said all the ingredients were very fresh and flavorful. Overall it was a very good sandwich. He was pleasantly surprised and I was relieved since coming to this spot was my idea. 

I ordered the blueberry steel salad with chicken added, it arrived about 5 minutes after my husbands sandwich. When it arrived it was covered with marinated onions. I immediately told her that the menu didn't state onions were on it and I don't eat onions. She asked \"is it an allergy?\" to which I replied \"No. I despise the smell and taste of onions\". She then asked \"do you want me to take it back and have them pick them off for you?\"  (Gross!) I said no, I will try to pick them off myself. 

Long story short - I could only eat about half my salad, the rest was laying on a napkin next to my bowl. The chicken I paid extra for was inedible, as were many of the toppings. It MIGHT be good but it's hard to say since mine smelled and tasted of onions and most of the toppings were laying on a napkin. 

As noted by previous reviewers, the only tea they have is bottles so there's no refills or sweetener available, if you use them. We only drink water and tea, and Usually more than one cup so it was a bummer that we couldn't get refills. 

Lastly, they had a person singing and playing the guitar. Usually I enjoy that atmosphere but it seemed overly loud to both of us. 

My husband said he would be willing to come again. I might but need to get over the literal bad taste of onions plus the offer to have them \"picking\" at my food. 

The husband gave it a 5 for his food, 1 for the rest. Averaging at 3 since 2.5 isn't an option."}
{"text":"Excellent Sandwiches and service and a wonderful win/win on good food & service, fun location and a worthy partnership benefit to the community."}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST BURRITO EVER!

If you're here for breakfast, get the Undergrad burrito. I get mine with avocado but man, this burrito is beyond delicious. 

I've never had a bad experience at an Even Stevens location and their business model is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches, spotless restaurant and the staff here are so amazing and kind. Would recommend times a thousand. We got the torta with pork and the turkey sandwich. So good!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and got the turkey pot roast both times.  It is a perfect sandwich in every way.  You might think turkey pot roast, yuck, but don't.  It's delicious and tastes like pot roast.  The bread is perfect, it holds up to the sogginess of the meat just right and doesn't fall apart.  We got an extra side of the brava tots and those were good too.

The ambience is great.  It's a super cute place and not super busy.  There's a lot of options in downtown Gilbert, don't skip this one.  Plus you can feel good about them donating a sandwich too."}
{"text":"Good food, good vibe. Great place to hang out if you are an ASU student. Staff was very friendly. An interesting blend of a 70's motif with modern technology. Very clean."}
{"text":"I had only ever been to the one downtown Phoenix. The Gilbert Location was great. The staff was friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed. The musician playing was great. I went for lunch and I had the salmon BLT. It was perfect."}
{"text":"1st time here and I accidentally requested a table for 3 to someone that looked like a manager.  He quickly, and curtly corrected me and told me I needed to order at the counter.  He then proceeded to ask me if I wanted a menu, and handed me a very well used menu that was even more bent than I was at this point. I apologized, and said oh sorry, it's our first time here.  His response? Yeah, you order at the counter, any questions?  Needless to say, food was ok -not worth the $10, however thank God they explain their giving campaign online or I would've had no clue how they truly give back.  Customer service was below average.  Especially since I gave them the chance to explain what they do...  No thanks, I will spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I really love this place they have amazing vegan and omnivore options for myself and entire family. The staff is very friendly, I was especially surprised by how knowledgeable and accommodating they were in regards to my vegan diet. They even have a vegan whoopee pie that's to die for! I usually opt for the hummazing sandwich which I 10/10 reccomend everyone try!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff at this retro location. The food is tasty and each location supports local causes/charities which I really dig.  Def come to eat, drink, play games and be apart of the community."}
{"text":"Unlike the other reviews, I will actually describe what was good to eat at Even Stevens.  My sprang chicken sandwich was really good, it came on a delicious type of toasted wheat bread that included bacon, avocado, etc.  I chose the salad as a side and would of liked more dressing bc it was good. Bc I checked in with Yelp, I received a big homemade cookie and I chose the sugar cookie which was soft and delicious! My sister ordered a GF grilled cheese sandwich with jalapeños that was pretty tasty & brussel sprouts with bacon and something that made them a little too sweet for my taste.  Also love the ice and that they use Peixoto for their ice tea.  It's the best!

Sidenote:  thank you to whoever made that incessantly loud tic toe game go away."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and had a great experience when I've sat inside. However, yesterday my friend and I sat outside and got unlimited French toast and tots. When they came out with my food they didn't bring tots so I reminded them I ordered them. They didn't come out for another 15 minutes and when I got them they were cold. We were also not offered more French toast and waited another 20 minutes before I had to go back inside to ask for another plate. They said they forgot about us. 15 minutes goes by and I assume she forgot to put the order in or something because it was a ridiculous wait. Finally after 20 minutes she came outside with French toast and we weren't even hungry anymore. Waited another 10 minutes to see if she would check up on us to offer us a to go box and no one ever came out. Really disappointed in the service. I tipped really well and had the worst service ever. If you want good service go sit inside. If you want to be forgotten then go outside."}
{"text":"SECRET best Saturday brunch spot in downtown Gilbert  The Undergrad breakfast burrito is amazing and the kids will love the stuffed French toast! Pleasant atmosphere with a few toys and games for kids."}
{"text":"It was disappointing after reading so many good reviews. The cobb salad was 90 percent lettuce with a few fatty slippery pork pieces and tiny bits of cream cheese, oh and a half a teaspoon of avocado. The dressing was garlicy and tasty. I also ordered the family tots they were cold and mushy, the bacon was crispy, but it could not save the dish. The beer cheese on the tots tastes like a beer, I could not taste any cheese.  When staff came to ask how meal was I said it was meh and he awkwardly removed our plates. No words were said. Staff overall is friendly and food was served quickly."}
{"text":"Vegan Sandwich paradise!! 

I can't tell you happy I was when I found out that they were opening a location in Old Town!! They also have fun games that you can play like Connect Four and Uno. Had a super fun brunch here with the gf where will had breakfast burritos and laughed at how unbeatable I am at connect four... jk.

I go back frequently for the Hummazing Vegan Sandwich as well as the Jackfruit Torta.

The Jackfruit is super yummy and its a great meat substitute. 

I tell everyone about the little place as it is off the beaten path and they are not normally super busy. 

They are right behind Morning Squeeze and they have $3 Mimosa brunch on Sundays!!"}
{"text":"First time here, definitely not our last! Food was delicious, salsa that came with burrito was too salty, served hot and timely. There was a gentleman playing guitar and singing music that was appropriate for the time of day. Staff was great and the store is super clean!!!!"}
{"text":"Holy cow this is a good sandwich!

Today (January 25, 2017) I had a Mihami Vice aka Cuban, and man it was good!  It was served at my table, warm, juicy on fresh toasted bread with pickles and chips. DELICIOUS! A healthy portion that I'm sure could be shared.

Plus the staff is friendly, there's good music and you're supporting a the less fortunate. This is what I call a win, win, win!

I'm holding back a star because besides bottled water, they didn't have an unsweetened drink option. Thanks Even Steven for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Very good service! Nice ambience! They have almond milk for the coffee which I love! The hummazing vegan sandwich is very creamy, rich and full of flavor! Thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"Bahn mi sandwich was rock star good.  I wasn't a fan of the side salad though.  Will go for the chips next time"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous & delicious!!  I had the Graduate with Pork Belly (made w/ house maple glaze) & my nephew had Graduate with bacon.  Nice pick me up, very strong coffee. Chocolate chip cookies was like cookie dough decadence \"Cookie Monster\" worthy. 

Breakfast burrito (2 versions with choice of Bacon, Ham, Sausage, Avocado or Pork Belly +$1):

Undergrad Breakfast Burrito - $6.75
Flour tortilla, Two eggs, choice of Meat, Pepper Jack, Tots, house sauce, Sriracha.

Graduate Breakfast Burrito - $7.75 
(same as Undergrad) +ADD Tomatoes, Onions, Spinach.

The New Morrissey Burrito - $6.75
FAMOUSLY VEGAN. MEXICAN SOYRIZO, MARINATED TOFU, TOTS, ROASTED VEGGIES & HOUSE MADE GARLIC BRAVA.

Sandwich with a Cause!  For each sandwich purchased, Even Stevens donates to local non-profit (Joshua Tree Feeding Program, Friendly House, ICM Food & Clothing Bank and Native American Connections). 

1/2 sandwich, 1/2 salad or soup & a drink special of $9.95 w/ kettle chips & dill pickle:  Had the Sprang Chicken (w/jalapeño jelly added yummmmm fave so far) & Pot Roast Dip. Both times had the Pork Belly Wedge Salad (delish) with it.  Great price & quite filling. 

Great coziness to this place with each location being customized to the neighborhood with local artistry feel & slight differences in food offerings.  Staff is very friendly & passionate with great smiles!!!

Gluten free available on all their sandwiches: just request it."}
{"text":"Overall I would give this place 4 stars.  

I'm compelled write this review because I had their bahn mi sandwich (however it is spelled). Let me clarify I've had this sandwich at other shops, so I understand it is a fattier sandwich. 

However, I give this sandwich at even Stevens a 2 star....just the sandwich itself. Staff is friendly, restaurant has great vibe, etc. if you order this sandwich just understand you are getting quarter inch slices of the fattiest bacon you've ever seen. I literally ate half my sandwich and tossed it. I realized I had nothing but pork fat in my mouth. Maybe this is okay for some people, but I don't want to pay $10 for pork fat. 

Try anything else on the menu or sub the pork for the mahi."}
{"text":"I read some reviews and decided to check it out.  I have been impressed with the incredible breakfast burrito! It was a great place to meet with my friend. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very upset..I came here a couple times and ordered the soup tomato bisque. Today I did a Togo order and ended up paying 5bux for what appears to be a very small amount of soup not even worth 2bux...Thank you for taking my money and not giving me my full cup of soup..."}
{"text":"I ordered the JP grilled cheese, it was very good. Only negative is that they were out of the French bread, but it was still amazing on whole wheat. The service was lacking for the most part. Seems as though they were a little understaffed for a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"I wish this place was close to work.  My husband and I had to go through some papers at the bank across the street so we order a sandwich to split, sat down to read the papers and have a snack.  Had the turkey with roasted tomato spread, dang that was a good sandwich.  I will take another please :)"}
{"text":"Went here for their grand opening and had a blast! I love concept of giving. I can not believe how many sandwiches these guys have given to causes locally. 

For every sandwich they sell they donate one. Can you BELIEVE that!!??

Have an amazing sandwich and support a good cause at the same time!!"}
{"text":"We had really high hopes after all the hype we've read/heard about! We ordered 2 sandwiches, 1 burrito & tots, it took almost 40 minutes with only a few people in the building. The tots were soggy & the pot roast sandwich would've been amazing minus the jalapeño jelly, it was just too sweet & overpowering. For the price we paid for the meals & the time it took to get the food it just isn't worth it for us."}
{"text":"A Sandwich shop with a cause they said, it's a new location they said!  

Ended up not coming here for the elite event, was looking for a relatively healthy spot for lunch last week and chose Even Stevens.  That idea, quickly went sideways as I chose the delicious kettle chips over the salad.  The girl up front was totally nice and had tips for the popular sandwich of the week and day.  

Breakfast is served all day and unlimited French Toast Brunch on Sundays...one day, one day.

When I got my pulled pork torta the busser stated that it had been popular.

Also, the soda machine: vanilla orange coke...cmon now, that's too much!!!"}
{"text":"Fricken amazing stuff! My boyfriend got the French dip (he's had many in his life) and he said this one was the best he's ever had. I got the breakfast burrito with \"soy-rizo\" (soy chorizo) and wow! It was so good, the prices are fair and the food is yummy, filling and timely. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The best love this place for a big salad after them gym , soup salad ice cream sandwiches ate bomb too"}
{"text":"I walked in a 9:30pm when they closed at 10. Even though they were close to closing time they were very nice and helpful. I got the  caprese sandwich and it was great and fresh even though it was almost closing time. I also had the Mac and cheese, I throughly enjoyed that as well. It's a great spot and I will be back."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try this place for a while and finally had the opportunity to do so today. I thought the location was very cute inside and I enjoyed that they do community outreach. However.... the banh mi I got was quite soggy. My friend got the Reuben which was much better. We also purchased an order of the beer cheese and pretzels that were just so so. Service was quick and courteous, but I just wasn't super wowed. I'll be back, as some sandwiches still sound delicious, but I would pass on the banh mi."}
{"text":"Decided to try this new place due to great reviews...they did not fail...the turkey pot roast on baguette was wonderful..served with bowl of a jus that was not salty..thumbs up...Steak  sandwich with Gouda also very good.  Sandwiches come with either chips or side salad.. we both ordered side salad.  I am not big fan of salad with no 'regular\" lettuce so sent salad home with sis.  We will return and hope to try Sunday brunch soon."}
{"text":"\"Buy a sandwich, donate a sandwich.\"

New sandwich place in Tempe (and Phoenix!!) is NOT messing around. Their takes on classic sandwiches are GREAT. I have tried the Mihami Vice (Cubano) and Banh Belly (banh mi) sandwiches. Both were great and had an extremely unique taste - a reason I will definitely be returning to explore other sandwiches and their unique twists.

I also ordered the Party Tots which, while delicious, were definitely not freshly fried tots (frozen, bagged tots?) They were still a great snack to munch on while waiting for our sandwiches, but the tot quality was not the highlight of this meal.

Rumor has it they have bottomless french toast and cheap mimosas on Sunday so I will definitely return for those!"}
{"text":"Cool little local sandwich shop with some funky(in a good way) sandwiches. The staff was really nice and the service was great. If in down town Phoenix y'all need to stop by for a bit."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast sandwich and it was delicious.  Also get the pretzel with beer cheese as it is outstanding.  Will definitely be back as this was the first time."}
{"text":"Just finished the jackfruit torta. Had it to go. Really like that the jackfruit was packed separately so the bread wouldn't get soggy. Great flavor. In fact, loved everything about the experience. Was there at 1pm and got in a line with 12 people ahead of me and walked out less than 20 minutes later. Fast and very friendly customer service. Definitely going back to try the vegan hummus sandwich. Looks like a great addition to downtown and how can you not LOVE their helping local social agencies?!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Great vibe in the heart of Phoenix. Highly recommend. Plus what's great business model of giving back to the community."}
{"text":"Delicious! Sprang Chicken was amazing with fresh greens and flavor. Definitely coming back! Love the idea of partnering to help the community"}
{"text":"Ok so my wife and I have a thing for sandwiches. All sandwiches. Big, small, toasted, baked, cold hot you name it. We are non-partisan sandwich lovers. This place....they are on the Mr. Rushmore of sandwich shops. Local ingredients,  amazing combinations (da gouda New York beef sandwich with onion marmalade) made to perfection.  By far the best sandwiches I've had in PHX. Can't wait to come back and explore the rest of the menu. To top that they are big time givers in the community. They have several non-profit partners and are constantly giving back to those in need.  Add it all up and this place now has a new customer for life."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are amazing and the staff even more impressive. Buy one sandwich, give one.  Even Steven's! 

Atmosphere: Trendy, fun and philanthropically efficient. 

Eat here & change lives!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich shop with gluten free options. Very fresh greens (always a sticking point for me) I despise limp greens. Great service and great live music. So happy to have them in downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"The grilled cheese, is bomb! They have Great sandwiches, and a fun vibe! Plus they donate proceeds to local charities which is pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Overpriced! Tomato bisque and grilled cheese Sandwich for $14.31? There are many overpriced restaurants in Arcadia that are at least good, but this was nothing more than tomato bisque from a can and cheese spread on French bread! Not impressed!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here for lunch not long ago and got the berry, chicken and oats salad and it was great. Anyone looking for a healthy alternative then this is the place. Can't wait to go back and try the sandwiches. Cool atmosphere inside!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great but inexpensive, and it all goes to a good cause! I love their stuffed french toast (only $4!) or their \"Do Gouda\" sandwich. I love that they partner with local non-profits, so I always feel good about buying a meal from here because I know that a portion of my purchase goes towards helping others!

The vibe of the restaurant is super 1970s. There's lava lamps, funky vintage furniture, and even classic board games for customers to play. The service is always friendly, and they're always willing to give recommendations. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos and other breakfast options are very good. The service was friendly and the interior area was very clean. Overall it's a good spot to grab a quick breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! Their sandwiches are amazing. Never did I think I would be obsessed with a vegetarian option but I totally am! That and their pork belly breakfast sandwich! Great now I'm hungry and wish they were open! Stop in today!!"}
{"text":"An interesting place. Found it by watching a local show on tv that talked the non profit work the company does. 

The food is good, the price is right. This location has a \"younger\" crowd than my wife usually mingle with but given its location next to the college, it's understandable. The place has a lot games and such for people hanging out.  Portions are ample. 
I have only done the breakfast thing and might have to try lunch."}
{"text":"Bahn Belly is pretty tasty if I must say.
I have got to try breakfast soon.
#localfoodie"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner the other night and really enjoyed the food and the service. The music was pretty loud, so it's hard to have a conversation with others during dinner, but overall the experience was really good. I would definitely recommend you give this place a shot."}
{"text":"I have been eyeing this sandwich shop for almost a year now and finally made my way in for lunch. It was definitely not what I expected, and in a good way! 

First, when you walk in you immediately step back in time, surrounded by 70s novelty items and memorabilia like roller skates, rotary phones, and a color palette that mimics the set of That 70's Show. There is ongoing 70s music playing in the background, which totally sets the vibe! There are community board games up for grabs, some of my favorites like Battleship, Guess Who, and Life. 

Then there's the food-mainly sandwiches, which the grilled cheese was unconventional with cream cheese and jalapenos in the mix, but tasty after my taste buds adjusted after the first bite. The sprang chicken sandwich was so-so, I think it needed more mayo? The pretzel bread with beer cheese was good, but I felt the consistency of the cheese was watery. The soda fountain is one of those fancy touch screen self serves, which is always nice for refills. The menu also featured unlimited French toast and $3 mimosas on Sundays. And here is the kicker for the grown folks--you can order a beer at this sandwich shop! 

The staff was very friendly, greeted us as soon as we came in and walked us through their set up (order first, pay, sit down with your table number). Quick service with our meals and bussing our table. I'm always a fan of good customer service!

The chain originated in Utah and is spreading along the West Coast. I definitely appreciate the concept and the atmosphere is groovy and chill. It is one of a kind when it comes to sandwich shops. If you love places like Cheba Hut, or Mellow Mushroom, then this place will intrigue you and make you wish you grew up in the 70s. I will definitely be back to sample more of the menu and I'm excited to try the Sunday brunch specials. Peace out!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich and vibes. The food is great with their mission statement and how they give back. The price are a little pricey but it's worth it. I got a vegan breakfast burrito and it just tasted like heaven. Very bold and strong taste that fills you up. I could only eat half before I was full. Great service with the employees and a very open environment.

Pros:
Fast, easy and delicious.
The cause and their goals to help the community.

Cons:
Price."}
{"text":"Hmmm.........this may be my new favorite sandwich place.
Had the vegan sandwich and it was THE BOMB!!!
Tons of flavors coming through. I am so glad I opted out of the Chop Shop 
next door. 
BONUS.......live music on a Sunday afternoon?  LOVE IT.
I ordered mine to go, but ended up staying and listening to the music and eating.
TOTALLY will be back."}
{"text":"We were staying downtown and thanks to Yelp, found this restaurant. After perusing the menu for a bit we decided on the pretzel bites with beer cheese, a Reuben and the Cubano sandwich. Plus a $1 Coors in the van for good measure.  (Can you beat that?!) Our pretzels arrived promptly and were holy moly amazing. The pretzels were warm and soft and perfectly salty, and the beer cheese was out of this world. I wanted to live inside it. Get this if you go, you HAVE TO! The sandwiches arrived shortly afterward and were equally delicious. The woman working at the front was bubbly and kind and very helpful to two out of towners. I highly recommend a stop at This awesome place! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Really good Undergrad Breakfast Burrito. It had tater tots in them! Cool vibe inside and very energetic and helpful employee."}
{"text":"Love that it's urban and so close to work, service was great, food was interestingly good."}
{"text":"Nice and unique atmosphere. Sandwich options come with unique options but easily customizable. Entire menu is served all day including breakfast items and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I came here for my lunch break at 11. There was one person before me and the line moved quickly. I ordered the grilled cheese which very cheesy and very tasty. Food is moderately priced the the ambience is lively."}
{"text":"I was one of the many people who previously passed this place by going to one of the neighbors. What a mistake, this is not another normal sandwich shop. Unique items like a mahi mahi bhan mi and a jack fruit machaca sandwich should tell you enough. The inside is bight and wide open, quite nice. The sandwich was on fresh crunchy baguette the mahi was well cooked and the slaw had a fair amount of flavor. It included kettle chips. 

They also donate to local food charities which is nice and does not seem to make the food over priced."}
{"text":"Cool place, great service, good vibe. Next time I'll trust my gut and try a sandwich. My hunger lead to me to the mac and cheese and brava tots (weird lunch I know!) The mac was a step above church's chicken chicken or KFC mac (neither of which I like), more of a cheese sauce vs. real cheese - bacon saved the day though! The tots were soft, not as crispy as I like and not really seasoned. Service was a tad slow but it was the lunch hour. I'll try again another day!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous place!! We went for lunch today, Sunday, and love it here!! Live music (great acoustic guitar and singing!), nice atmosphere, delicious food-my husband LOVES the gf bun on his So Gouda sandwich, endless brioche French toast (which I didn't get but looked amazing!!!), my daughter loved her macncheese, and my lettuce wrapped chicken sandwich was so yummy! 
Great service, fair prices...and the BEST part? They give back! They feed homeless people and support other local charities! Great restaurant! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I can't even explain how bomb it is to get the grilled cheese and add steak. I got the Brussels sprouts as an appetizer last time and was thoroughly impressed with them as well. Keep the chill vibes going"}
{"text":"Holy heavenly sandwiches! The sandwiches available here are amazing! There was live music when we stumbled upon this place. It's a cool vibe. We like that they give back to the community. The setup is a little weird - ordering and paying without much service other than bringing your sandwiches to you. If you're planning on more than one mimosa, beer, or non-fountain beverage, the prices will lure you in but getting the additional refill seems a little tough. This also applies to the all you can eat french toast. I'd vote they stick to the sandwiches. I'll be back for more tasty sandwiches in the future!"}
{"text":"Big Ruben fan, order the food had great service. I ordered it to go for home and was excited to eat. The sandwich meat looked purple not red so was a little weird but still dove in because of the excitement of what I have heard. Sub par meat, sub par quality, with a good meaning behind it. Don't recommend it unless you have heard of a better experience. Good luck."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this location so far. Love the one downtown. Stopped in today on my way home from work to get a quick salad. The guy at the register was good. However, service was slower than molasses despite being one of only three customers, they gave me the wrong dressing, my chopped salad was not actually chopped or even cold, and the cookie I ordered/paid for didn't make it into my bag. Unfortunately I didn't notice the missing cookie until way later because I got busy handing out candy to trick or treaters. 

Ugh."}
{"text":"Marginal at best. You can get a much better sandwich at Firehouse Subs. Party tots absolutely disgusting...my wife and each are one and spit it out. This was our first...and last visit."}
{"text":"This place is the God Father of all sandwich places. Not only is the food phenomenal, but they donate to such a good cause. If your hungry and want to satisfy your deepest sandwich craving, come here and get the turkey day and some baked Mac. Better yet get any sandwich because they are all SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to get some late night sandwiches (10:45pm) for the family. We got a Cubano (by far the best of the 3 sandwiches we ordered. A Sprang Chicken sandwich - very fresh! And a club sandwich - delicious. They all came with tiny bags of chips and each cost about $10."}
{"text":"The Reuben!!! If you go here you have to try the Reuben. I had a hankering and they fulfilled it! Really modern setting and they have noble mission."}
{"text":"We love this place. We discovered them in Utah and couldn't believe that they came to Peoria. They have the best sandwiches and breakfasts. The food is always fresh and delicious. The staff is always friendly and helpful. And, they do good in the community. Win, win, win!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I have now had all of the vegan options. I first tried the Hummazing, then the vegan breakfast burrito, and today the Jackfruit Torta. It was so yummy! The atmosphere is nice, and they donate to local charity. It doesn't get much better than this in my book!"}
{"text":"So excited we got one of these on the Westside! Amazing food, specifically the pork dip!"}
{"text":"Great capreezy sandwich.  Delicious pretzel bread.  Fun atmosphere and fantastic socially conscious business model! We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place! The service was amazing and everyone was so friendly, they donate to good causes with every sandwich purchased, and the food was amazing and very well priced! I will definitely be back and will recommend it to anyone craving a sandwich."}
{"text":"Perfect for any diet, vegan sandwiches that are huge and so delicious! not your run of the mill vegan either- i had a jackfruit sandwich, it was delicious. love companies that have a purpose, buy a sandwich give a sandwich. super cute & retro inside as well!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches!! Each one is unique with interesting combinations. They also has an assortment of local beers to pair with your sandwich. We will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Staff are really friendly and fast service. Sunday's unlimited French toast and $3 mimosas is hard to pass up. Next time we'll bring our dog (patio area approved!)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food, and very clean environment. I love this place. There's always a staff member cleaning and keeping the place nice."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good but the lack of consideration for customers is poor.  I came with a infant on my way to buy buy baby to enjoy an evening out of the house.  I ordered my food and sat down and quickly noticed the music was abnormally loud with a strong base component.  My ears were hurting so I asked if they were able to turn it down because of my ears hurt I couldn't imagine what my baby was feeling.  The girl at the counter said there was no way to turn it down (flat out lie since I've been here before when the music was off during Sunday brunch).  Anyways the food is good but won't be back due to child being attached at the hip for the next few months and it's just not safe to expose his hearing for a sandwich."}
{"text":"First time eating there and not very impressed. The samdwhiches were good. I recommend the Rueben and the turkey. The woman server was not very pleasant or polite."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after flying into Phoenix. First and foremost, it's in the downtown area so finding parking was a huge pain. We drove around a good bit before we could a spot. Once inside though, it was a really wonderful experience! They had live music on a sunny Sunday afternoon although there weren't very many people inside. I checked in on Yelp and received a free cookie so that was a sweet treat! I was so excited to see that they served shishito peppers so we ordered that to start and then I ordered the Hummazing Vegan. I understand that hummus was the star to this sandwich, but I was overwhelmed by the amount of hummus there was! It tasted great with all of the other layers, but I wound up scraping a lot of it off. Another thing we noticed was the huge amount of homeless people that hung out right outside the storefront and we were asked for money constantly to and from our car. I would have loved if this place had a better location!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! So glad we have a great sandwich place in chandler!! The food in incredible!"}
{"text":"Great gourmet style sandwiches that serve another purpose other than feeding my face. I love it! When you support this trendy sandwich shop by eating there or catering your next luncheon you support a local charity that serves our homeless or food banks. 
Please make sure to support this great business!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to for all my sandwich and salad needs! The food is delicious and they have awesome service. The vibe is great and it's great to bring co-workers etc."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by all the good reviews... the service was quick and kind.  However, the food was not something I would try again.  I got the gluten free sprang chicken- the gluten free bread was decent but there was absolutely no flavor to the chicken.  My husband got the miami vice and he said it was the worst sandwich he ever had- he never leaves food uneaten but two bites in and he threw the entire sandwich away.  His sandwich was two pieces of cut deli pork and was soggy and flimsy.  We will not be giving this place another try and don't recommend spending your money there either.  Which truly stinks because I loved the mission that the company stands behind."}
{"text":"Love the concept of supporting the community, however I could not get with serving French toast that was sitting for awhile and having to inquire if it was my order!!! The French toast looked good and appeared to have some white icing on it.. li and beholdby the time I received it , it was cold and the icing was fat that formed while waiting to get to my table... Bacon was cold and came in a bowl bowl swimming in oil .. awful!!! According to my daughters there breakfast burritos were good.  Not coming back"}
{"text":"WOW AMAZING!!! Probably one of my favorite sandwich spots in town now! I enjoyed the Pot Roast Dip. Which is made out of turkey!! It had the jalepeno jelly inside, some cheese with a choice of chips or salad. I chose the salad with their house vinegarette on top! The set up inside is so cute! Tons of seating! If you haven't tried Even Stevens you definitely have to!"}
{"text":"I was in early on a Wednesday morning for breakfast on my way to a conference. The cashier was friendly in taking my order, but maybe not totally with it as I had to ask for my receipt even after selecting to have it printed on the Square reader.

I got the stuffed French toast, and it was pretty amazing and the price was right. It took maybe 10-15 minutes for it to come out. I used the free wifi and checked in on some work emails while I waited.

I was able to get in and out of the place in a reasonable amount of time. Food was good, prices were okay, and the biz concept is great. I would return and try them for lunch."}
{"text":"I like this place as a very casual sandwich shop. You have to place your order at the counter, which I didn't like. They do deliver to the table via a stantion  number system.
But that's about the only thing I didn't like. Sandwiches at our table were delicious and generous!  Outside seating was on an entertaining intersection. The light rail arrives and departs within a block. Clean. Good service. A good place!"}
{"text":"Really loved the idea of this place and loved the live music. I was a bit disappointed with my salad, I had the greens with cheese and pecans. They were very light on the dressing and I couldn't find salt and pepper any where. My family had the sloppy joe and the caprese sandwich and they were happy with their choices. I was also disappointed there wasn't any iced tea included with the beverage choices."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our breakfast burrito's and French toast. Kids loved they had games. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Very unique and delicious sandwiches. The inside has a nice open atmosphere. Sandwich left me feeling very satisfied. I tried the banh belly which was exceptional, and the missus and kiddo both enjoyed their sandwiches as well. I will definitely be back to try some of their other sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I catered the vegetarian/vegan options for my wedding reception from here. I ordered a mix of the Hummazing and the Caprezzy sandwiches as well as some of their catering sized salads. Everything was delicious and fresh. They delivered it right on time, and even brought me a card for my wedding! They said I was the first wedding they catered. It was absolutely perfect. Sierra was the catering manager that helped me and she was the absolute sweetest!"}
{"text":"Really amazing gourmet sandwiches!

The location is spot on for ASU students. It has a very modern style to it - good atmosphere. It's a fairly large venue with lounge coaches and free wifi to eat and study as well. I have to say, the rest room is extremely clean and smells too good!

The food. When I walked in, I ordered in the front of the store but food is served to our table and they cleaned after us. 

I ordered the Bomb Mi with Mahi Mahi (fish is a few bucks more; the meat is usually pork belly). I'm guessing this is there take on the classic Vietnamese Banh Mi sandwiches. Has a mayo/aoili spread and pickled veggies to go with it. The fish was cooked and seasoned perfectly (not a dry flake of fish). The French bread that sandwiches everything was good as well - soft and dense inner bread to soak up the garlicky soy sauce sauce with a crusty outer layer.

Also tried my girlfriends sandwich, the Mi Hanoi vice. Great sandwich as well. Has less things going on, but the flavor/savoriness is on point. The belly fat definitely plays a huge role in the flavor. I do feel like it's too fatty - the chunks of pork belly have a huge amounts of fat on them (of course, that's pork belly for you).

Meals come with soup or salad. We both got salad (not your typical romaine) with cherry tomatoes and a drizzle of vinaigrette."}
{"text":"4 1/2 Stars and 1 Dollar Sign price point???  Not so sure about that.

It's not all bad, but also not deserving of either of these.  My experiences:

FIRST TRIP
I went on a Sunday afternoon about 4:15pm only to find they were closed.  It's true that I didn't think to check their hours of operation, but what restaurant closes before dinner???

SECOND TRIP
Returned on Thursday for lunch.
1.  Be prepared to jockey other vehicles in the parking lot.  There are cars going INTO and OUT of the neighboring Dutch Bros. drive thru line, not to mention other cars from Rural Rd. trying to squeeze into the long parking lot line and still others into and out of parking spots.  It could be a while, as it was for me.  It's something to consider if you have limited time.

2.  The ambiance was nice; a mixture of new construction and a 1970's theme.  You'll find games like Lite Brite, a lava lamp and patterned wall coverings to bring you back in time.  The facility was largely clean; a definite must!

3.  The service was ... umm...all over the place.  Initially, a new hire cheerfully explained the menu and ordering options.  It's nice to know ESS gives back to the community.  A second woman took my order, but didn't seem happy to be there.  There was no smile, little eye contact and she didn't provide the drink cup included with the combo.  I waited while she took another person's order to ask for one.  A third woman delivered food to the table and seemed pleasant.  Against my better judgement, I left a 20% tip at the time I placed my order when I should have waited until just before I left.  NONE of them bothered to check back to ask is everything was ok.

4.  The food was ok for \"quick serve\" but, in my opinion, overrated.  I ordered the 1/2 sandwich, 1/2 salad and drink combo, plus a \"bite\".  The menu (see photo) indicated the Mihami Vice (Cubano) sandwich is served on a baguette, but mine was on sliced bread (see photo).  The roasted pork seemed to have little flavor and the sandwich was overpowered by the taste of not the mustard listed on the menu (see photo), but something resembling mayo.  The Blue(Berry) Steel salad (see photo) had one large clump of granola on top which was difficult to spear with a fork.  Is this what the menu (see photo) means by \"warm\"???  The combo came with chips which were the best part of the meal.  I'm not sure the Cheesy Baked Mac (see photo) had any real cheese or was even baked.  The cheese was more of an imitation cheese sauce, instead of real cheese and the consistency was that of a well-known boxed version.  The mixed in bacon was ok.  It was topped with diced tomatoes which seemed fresh.

Overall, it was certainly not the worst meal I've had, but not close to being worthy of the 4 1/2 stars currently on Yelp or close to the one dollar sign (under $10) price point displayed, even if I hadn't ordered the \"bite\".  My tab (see photo) with tax and 20% tip was closer to two dollar signs at $19.09 and should have been half the price point."}
{"text":"Great service. Great atmosphere. Really good breakfast and sandwiches. Best bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"The food was great. Came here after a trip to check out ASU one week and before driving back to Cali met a friend here. It was around 10 am and the customer service was iffy at first when I came in no one really greatest us it wasn't until we got up to the front to order that the cashier was nice and taking our order that's the only reason I won't give it the full 5 stars. The sandwich was awesome I also had some tots with my meal which are pretty big and filling. I ended up taking it to go for the road but over all the food was good. It's a nice artsy location. I just think they do need netter greeting manners or friendlier service when people walk in. Especially people going for the first time and trying to explore the menu it would be cool if we got a better first impression."}
{"text":"It was NOT Mexican.  We were avoiding Mex, Indian, Thai, sushi, bbq, Ethiopian & just sticking to regular, casual.  We never tried downtown Gilbert (east valley) & EVERY PLACE  was swamped at noon on a gorge sunny, warm Sunday.  We loved the idea of a live guitarist/singer, too!  He was very good & never played a song I didn't know....FUN!  $1 of each sandwich order they use to feed the poor, which was cool.  They even had girls selling GS cookies at the next restaurant down!  Of course, some of our party picked out a few boxes.  Me being a Brownie & GS leader of years gone by resisted the cookies. The place was certainly mellow, relaxed & perfect for a place to sit & enjoy our sunny Sunday'ish day.  I think we all enjoyed our relaxed brunch...yes we tipped the great young singer!  He even sang \"Norwegian Wood\"...a fave Beatle song of mine, & we laughed when he played a really interestng version of of a 70\"s disco version of Donna Summer's \"She Works Hard for her Money!\"   We all enjoyed our brunch & was pretty sure, our guest, Brian, did too.!!    PS, we tried burgers, french toast, breakfast sandwichs, salads....and their delish mimosas!!"}
{"text":"New location for this fantastic sandwich shop. The food is amazing and the staff is super friendly and helpful.
The restaurant is very open with windows all around. I will definitely be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Magic. I'm not sure how they do it but the breakfast burrito is magic. The atmosphere is super inviting, spacious, and laid back. They have board games and such if you plan to stay a while. Everything I've tried here is DELICIOUS. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yum. 

Good service: the man working at the register was awesome. He was fast and attentive. 

Food: sooooo goood! I ordered the jackfruit torta and it was delicious! Ordered it to go & the sandwich came deconstructed so nothing got soggy. Even if you're not a vegan, it's a tasty sandwich. Also, check in on Yelp for a free cookie!

Atmosphere: it's really a cool spot. There was live music today which was nice. Not sure if that's everyday but I'm guessing it's often! 

Prices: very fair. Sandwiches come with either a salad or chips plus a pickle. Plus the sandwiches are a good size. 

Do yourself a favor and come here!!!"}
{"text":"Of all of the Utah fast-casual exports (Cafe Rio, Zupa, Kneaders, Rumbi, etc...) this might be my favorite.  They combine some of the more creative sandwiches you'll find, with some of the most genuine philanthropy you will encounter in the 'for profit' space.  To top it off they create a comfortable atmosphere that isn't typically found in this category.  

My only complaint is that they over do some of the sauces to the point where they overshadow the rest of the sandwich. A minor quibble as I have pretty much enjoyed every sandwich I've tried."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Even Stevens and it was great! My friends and I thought we would try it out Sunday afternoon after church and I would highly recommend and can't wait to go back. The lady at the register was so friendly and great at answering every question we had! I got the JP Grilled Cheese, had some spice too it but over good. And overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Had a light dinner here one recent weeknight. Had Da Gouda and tater tots with the 3 sauces. There was no one in the restaurant, however the manager was very friendly and my order arrived promptly. The sandwich was bursting with flavor and it was obvious they used quality ingredients. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful- great food, great prices and great service. Plus a portion of proceeds feed folks in need. You can tell the team really believes in what they are doing and enjoy it. I had a goat cheese salad with arugula and fresh beets that was to die for. So glad they came up my neighborhood."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place not really knowing what a community minded concept they had going!! We love it!! Plus, the food is amazing! I had Mac & Cheese with Bacon  and my hubby had a vegan sandwich option that he was digging!! We practically fought over the Brussel Sprouts....yeah that's right! They are Bomb!!! Hate that it's a bit of a jaunt for us but worth the drive! Service was personalized and fun! That's key!! People loved working there bragging about the goodies, offering suggestions and showing Pride in their community outreach to feed those in Need"}
{"text":"This place is welcoming and staff is very hospitable, felt like home away from home. Food is excellent. I ordered the French toast and bacon and my husband ordered the breakfast burrito, both fabulous and reasonably priced. The manager Hector was very passionate and attentive in asking all the right questions and adding info on live music and trivia nights. Will most certainly be back with my friends!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are solid and they donate to a few local food banks every time you buy one!  Eat well and show your support!"}
{"text":"Great food, and the waitress asked me if I work around the area, (which I do) and she put in a discount for me, which is awesome! I don't even work at a nice, well-known spot."}
{"text":"I randomly dropped by Even Stevens yesterday because I was starving after a doctors apt and I could not resist after seeing all the good yelp reviews.

It was a good experience, but not amazing ... I would say everything was average.  I tried the Rubin sandwich and their side salad.  It was tasty, but like I said I've had better, and I've definitely had worse.  I felt like there could have been more meat in the sandwich and some of the meat was quite fatty.  The salad was also tasty and healthy.

The space is very cool and I love the fact that they donate to charity.  

The girl who took my order and one of the servers were friendly and super sweet.

Overall, do I think it was deserving of a near 5 star yelp review?  Ehhhh ... The sandwich just wasn't that great, but I did like the vibe ... I would return if I was in the area, but I would probably give another spot a shot before coming here again.... It was just okay for me overall ... Nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice and was greatly disappointed both times. The first time I tried a Do Gouda sandwich and the Party Tots. The sandwich was very greasy - more so than any sandwich I have had before - I don't feel I tasted much of the flavor combos just grease. 

The tots were served with super ripe onion that overpowered the entire dish, they were also dry and had a thin slime of ranch dressing and various toppings. 

I unfortunately tried this place again and had a 1/2 soup 1/2 sandwich combo. I choose the tomato basil soup and the Turkey Day sandwich. The sandwich has a tomato jam that is oddly sweet tasting, the bread was crispy/greasy again and the soup was so sickly sweet. I regretted the rest of that whole day that I ate it. I don't eat many greasy things and in retrospect, I wonder if they are deep frying their bread. I also wondered if the basil on top the soup had gone bad. There is something so very greasy queasy wrong with this place. 

The menu sounds great - in actuality it doesn't play well at all. After the last afternoon that I suffered through -- I wouldn't eat here again if it was free. 
Now that's ironic."}
{"text":"Always great service and sandwiches at any of their locations. This place stands behind a great mission, happy to support it anytime"}
{"text":"I won't be coming back here for a long time! I placed a take-out order for one sandwich at 12:45 pm. 30 minutes later, I was still waiting and was told that because they were busy, it would be another 20 minutes - for one sandwich.  They refunded my money when asked; however, the tip that I gave was not refunded. They said that the system won't refund a tip.  So basically I gave them money to wait way too long for nothing!  Great idea for your customers - tell them it's a 45 minute to an hour wait BEFORE they place an order."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and the staff friendly. I had the sloppy Joe sandwich with a side salad and a drink. My co-worker had the JP Grilled Cheese sandwich. The place is cool and the interior fun and funky. The food was ok but not amazing. (Full disclosure: I'm not big of sandwiches in general, but it was a sandwich kind of day.)

My sandwich was very bread-y. I should have picked something on a different kind of bread. I only ate half of the gigantic roll it came on. (Yay me!) The meat was seasoned very well and there were onions and a bit of slaw on top. Pretty good!. The side salad was ok, but I'm not big on mixed greens. There wasn't any crunch and I need crunch in my salad. The salad needed a little umph, in my book. It was just too plain. It was a better option than the chips, though.  

I ordered a drink too and headed back to the fountain area. What? No ice tea?  How can that be? OK, I'll have a rare diet coke.  Really? None either? My guess is that the machine wasn't connected or they ran out. I asked about the ice tea and was told that they had it in cans in the front. Oh well. I guess I just expect there to be an ice tea available in all restaurants.

My co-worker said her grilled cheese was good and not too spicy. Definitely not low-cal based on its looks. 

A customer in the booth next to us asked if his sandwich was indeed gluten free an an official looking guy who worked there told him it was not. The customer was upset since he ordered his sandwich on gluten free bread. The \"manager\" apologized over and over again, which was great. After that he brought over a gift card for the customer that he could use later. Be sure you confirm that your sandwich is indeed gluten free!

Last, I noticed that Even Stevens supports non-profit partners. For every sandwich sold, They donate a sandwich to a local non-proflt. That's very cool. Thumbs up! 

I plan to go back and try something different. I hear the Sunday morning unlimited french toast is a steal!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, we've tried a few things on the menu and have not been disappointed yet, not to mention what this company stands for, and who they partner with....it's within walking distance of our home which is even better, if you're in the neighborhood make sure you stop by and try this place out."}
{"text":"The sandwich market here in Phoenix is a bit saturated with many options, but I think that Even Stevens is one of the best as far as taste and cost! I love their business model of donating a sandwich for every purchased. I enjoy eating here rather than carrying out because of the vibe! (Grabbing Dutch Bros near by never hurts either!) There are board games to keep you entertained and the food is relatively fast and very fresh! This is a great study break and I am very pleased with this new opening and location! Parking is not an issue and there is plenty despite being close to campus."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place today. It's literally a 90 second drive from my office. Nice building, very open and inviting. A/C was blazing, making the wait very comfy on a hot afternoon. The guy at the counter was pleasant enough. The rest of the story was underwhelming at best. It took quite a while to get my to-go Rueben. When I eagerly opened the sealed foil (not) 2 minutes after I was handed my bag, it was limp and tasteless. No \"yum\" first bite on this summer day. Wasn't expecting that from such a hearty classic. I imagined they were too busy behind the magic wall to keep it on the grill long enough to crisp up the rye, or to heat it well through. However, that's not the deal breaker for me. There was literally twice as much pink, pickled cabbage than beef. The overwhelming flavor was sour cabbage. My suggestions for management? Give us more than a thin layer of beef, and spice it up for God's sake! Just a shake of S&P, and the cheesy sauce would do the rest. And, a little sour cabbage goes a long way! Also, if your'e gonna grill it, don't be shy. Anyone reading, rethink spending $10 for a simple food item, unless it's exceptional. This one wasn't. Too bad. (I know, what do I expect from a chain?)"}
{"text":"Not in the area of this shop often at all but looked good. Got the Cubano sandwich and thoroughly enjoyed it. Meaty sandwich with great flavor and came with a little salad too. Definitely would go here again."}
{"text":"sooooo happy to have even stevens in the hood! came the day after opening and was so surprised at how smoothly everything was running. I had the mihami vice (Cuban) with a side salad and the husband has the French dip with chips. we also shared the shishitos and everything was delish..super delish. everyone working was so welcoming and informative about the work they do in the community, which I appreciate! can't wait to try the tots and brunch options. one visit in and I'm a forever fan of even stevens :)!"}
{"text":"FOODIES! Come one, come all! This place has such a great modern industrial feel inside. I love that you can enjoy your food at a table with friends and family or all gather on the couches, eat your food and play some board games.

The service was great, you find your own seat and when you are ready to order you make your way up to the register. You're given a number and the food comes out really fast! I mean really fast!! They about put Jimmy Johns to shame. 

I got the Hummazing Vegan. I've been vegetarian for about to years now and I really miss my big meaty sandwiches. This sandwich really blew my socks off. It's really hard to make every bit great when it come to a sandwich but these guys have figured it out. 

My wife got the JP grilled cheese, you better believe a snagged a bit of that. I really couldn't believe that that sandwich was just as good as the one I chose. Maybe we got lucky and ordered the 2 best things. 

If you are looking for a great sandwich with a great cause I would stop over to Even Stevens Sandwiches. You buy a sandwich and they give one to those in need. This place is a stand up sandwich joint."}
{"text":"Our family loved it! The kids played their board games while waiting for their food. Our sandwhiches were amazing! My husband got the stuffed french toast and loved it. Gotta try the brussel sprouts! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow what an over all amazing experience! Hands down my favorite place in Old Town Scottsdale. My family and I went out for a family night to Even Steven's, Steven himself was in from Salt Lake City visiting the location at the same time as our visit. He personally came up to my family and introduced himself. Explained to my nieces how for every sandwich bought, Even Steven's donated one to a non profit charity. Talk about giving back to the community and less fortunate. We came in behind a large party and expected to wait for our order, and the nice thing about hanging out is they provide games and coloring. Wish a mid-century modern decor it makes you feel at home. Steven gave my nieces complimentary pookie pies from Salt Lake City, which they of course are over the moon about. Then my sister's sandwich was the las one to come out and the manager came out to make sure we had everything we needed, as well as taking care of the sandwich for the long wait. Which we weren't even concerned about. If that doesn't meet your service expectations, I don't know what will. I am completely satisfied with my visit, atmosphere and the food is amazing. Even Steven's added vegan options to the menu. The jackfruit frittata is the best vegan sandwich i have ever had in Arizona. I will always be a happy camper coming to Even Steven's, thank you for taking such outstanding care of my family Steven and all the Even Steve's staff."}
{"text":"So my group of friends are doing a 24 hour Questival adventure race and one of the \"challenges\" was to eat at Even Stevens. I wouldn't really consider it a challenge though because we were hungry and couldn't wait to get here after the opening festival! 

My friends all got different sandwiches, which they loved but I ordered a chicken, berry and oats salad. It's very unlike me to order a salad but for some reason, I was craving something good but easy to eat. I'll admit. This was the first time I've eaten a salad with granola oats in it. It was made of homemade granola oats so the good type of chunky and flavorful.  With the blueberries and the feta cheese, it was a really refreshing salad! The chicken seemed like it was roasted and thinly sliced. The large salad was very filling even though it was just a salad.

The environment was warm and inviting. Tables resided both indoors and outdoors. The patio wasn't too large but gave just enough space for people to enjoy the outdoors especially during the nicer weather now. On the other side, there was a brightly colored turquoise couch with colorful pillows and a coffee table facing two large grey swivel chairs. Our group gravitated towards this couch! The coffee table had books about the history of Arizona and Phoenix with a lot of photographs. 

The best part about Even Stevens is they donate sandwiches to non profits!! I can't say there are many sandwich shops out there that exist for a cause other than just food alone! I'm glad I finally got a chance to try Even Stevens and can't wait to go back to actually have sandwiches and not just a salad!"}
{"text":"Toby really ruined Even Stevens for me. I've made my way around to every location but that hobbit looking man really chapped my ass. Won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Yum!  Hungry for a great sandwich?... here is a great option. 
I got the Ruben sandwich, which was hot, juicy, delicious. The meat was plenty large for the fresh bread. Arugula topping was a nice touch.  

Staff friendly. Clean and open space inside. Can't wait to try another one."}
{"text":"Eat a sandwich - Give a sandwich.

When I started to write up the review this morning, Even Stevens located in Gilbert was just about to hit their 500 sandwich donated and they've been open less than a week. Even Stevens might be a bit of a youngster in the sub shop world, having opened their first spot in 2014, but clearly these sandwich artisans are on to something. 

Being a good neighbor is an important part for each Even Stevens store so each location gives back to the local community. The local non-profit partners for this location are: Open Arms Care Center, United Food Bank, Boys & Girls Clubs of The East Valley, and A New Leaf. 

But that's not the only good thing about Even Stevens. They also offer tasty food with friendly service, that you can feel great about supporting because you are helping give back locally. Their sandwiches are full of flavor too! Probably due to the fact that they use local bread and ingredients that are additive free and san artificial flavors. Plus, their veggies are prepped in house daily so you know what you get is fresh!

But the standout menu item is the Stuffed French Toast. It is packed full of a banana sweet cream and topped with a warm berry compote. The price point of $5.95 is great for the amount you get. Hoping to try their Sunday Brunch sometime soon! Unlimited French toast and $3 mimosa! Sounds delicious, filling, and wallet friendly. 

If you stop by on a Thursday or Friday night or Sunday afternoon you can enjoy some local live music, which just adds to the very chill vibes of the shop. 

My only wish is for them to offer local tea options like they do for coffee. But that is honestly the only tiny improvement that could make this place even better. 

Kudos Even Stevens for being so awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm a little bummed-a-roni about this place! Our boss treated everyone for lunch here and I was super excited when I saw there was a Banh Mi on the menu. 

My sandwich was INSANELY soggy, I mean sloppy joe on a Walmart hamburger bun soggy. The description states this would be served on a baguette; however, it came on what appears to be a hoagie. I also have zero cilantro or roasted Jalapenos. 

I am still giving a 3 star rating because the side salad was good; and although I had to wade through the sandwich like Michael Phelps during spring training, the flavors are there.

I will give the place another shot as the other Bahn Mi photos on this  review look amazing! I am hoping it was just a one off situation and that it this could have been the result of my managers voodoo powers to kill everyone's joy, even free lunches!"}
{"text":"Nice place, way fancier than your average sub/sandwich place. Very welcoming and cozy. Service was great. Everyone was very friendly. They have a good variety of options, I just did not like my choice that much. I had the Mihami, the description sounded like a Cuban sandwich (not sure if it is) and it is the one the lady at the register recommended as one of the ones with most meat. I asked if it could be wrapped in lettuce and they said yes.
It was OK. The cheese was not melted and was kind of strong in flavor (probably because of the 'wrapped in lettuce' thing. Oh by the way, it was very loosely wrapped)... My friend liked her salad, she just mentioned the oats were very sweet and she was not expecting that (kind of rolled in honey or something).
The food seemed good quality and I would like to try more options, they had good options for drinks too (unsweetened teas, fountain machine, etc).
Overall, a nice and friendly place to meet with a friend and catch up."}
{"text":"Awesome, fresh, clean, friendly and great value. I ate the vegan jack fruit sandwich and fell in love on the first bite! Husband had the turkey day sandwich and loved it! 
Trevor introduced us to the community give back programs.  I want to buy all of my friends a sandwich:)"}
{"text":"If you want happiness, have a JP grilled cheese with their tomato soup.

Their food is awesome, although the blaring music is a bit too much, why has this become a trend in restaurants? Why does the music have to be so loud?  When I cannot hear the person behind the register, I am less likely to go back, luckily this place has good food."}
{"text":"This place has a great Pot Roast dip, wow ! The server / cashier was super friendly and helpful on what choices they have"}
{"text":"This place rocks!
The motto behind the business means a lot!
They donate monthly a % of all sales to several local charities. 
How many businesses do that???
On top of the food which is so yummy! I got the breakfast burrito it was packed with a ton of food it was paired very well! Per our server suggestion and a good suggestion at that! This is definitely a place that I would visit again and again went in the area! Thanks even Stevens!
I wish we had more restaurants and businesses like you!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast burrito and sandwiches. Rhythm was awesome!!!
Definitely like for every sandwich purchased one is provided for the hungry"}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 overall. 

I ordered online at Even Stevens to grab sandwiches on a weeknight. Grabbed the Jackfruit Torta for myself, the Mihami Vice cubano for my friend, and the brava tots. I was pleasantly surprised to get a text telling me that my order was ready for pick up! 

Now the food itself was ok, but not that amazing. The jackfruit torta filling was inside a soup container and the bread was wrapped in foil, but the cubano was already assembled together when we grabbed our items out of the bag. I liked the jackfruit torta for the most part, but didn't expect that they would basically hand me a disassembled sandwich to assemble. I can understand that this keeps it from being too soggy, but it was just a bit strange to me. The flavors of the torta were good, but a little one note so I might try something else in the future. My friend liked the cubano, but felt that it wasn't really anything special. The real let down were the brava tots which were soggy and almost stale. I was really excited to have crispy tots with some brava sauce, but they were honestly so soggy that it just ruined the meal a bit. (I know that's a bit dramatic, but I just really love potatoes!)

Overall, it's cool that you can order online and pick up your food or eat there when you're feeling like it. The sandwiches themselves didn't really live up to my expectations so I'm not sure if I'll go back in the near future, but it's a sandwich option in the neighborhood if you really just want a sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is going to be huge! Not an Italian sandwich stop that you may be looking for (if so go to Defalcos on Scottsdale road), but they have unique (kinda hipster?) sandwiches loaded with toppings. Feelin the hipster lounge vibes they've got going on as well."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend and I have been to multiple Even Stevens locations (Arizona, Utah, Colorado) and the food is amazing across the board! Same friendliness from the team, fun and chill environment with sandwiches worth driving hundreds of miles for! Thank you Adrian for you kind service and making our visit so great, keep it up Colfax!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch after the crowds had died down. Had the Turkey sandwich with a side salad and an order of the Brava Tots. Tots were tasty and the salad greens were fresh. The sandwich had great bread and a good bit of turkey on it. I liked the subtle bite of the cranpepper spread. Also made sure to check in and get my free cookie-oatmeal-delicious. All in all, it's a go to lunch spot for me when in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly staff, awesome live music provided by Davis, and some great food! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Such a simple but satisfying meal! For only $3.75, you get unlimited French toast on Sundays. They always have really awesome live music too. 

My husband and I went there to end our staycation after staying in downtown Phoenix, and honestly, it was probably the highlight of the weekend. The musician playing was perfect and all the people working were super kind and attentive. I'm just in love with the vibe of this place!

You also can't beat the price! We got two unlimited French toasts and an order of Party Tots for less than $20 including a 25% tip. 

I also checked in on Yelp, and I got a free cookie which I'm super jazzed about."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Think Roosevelt row/hipster cafe plopped right smack in the middle of downtown Phoenix. Large space, 30+ tables (mix of tables, bench sitting, sofas and outdoor patio.  Very bustling atmosphere, patrons mostly white collars on lunch and convention goers. 

Food: Menu has your typical artisan inspired sandwiches and salads that include micro greens, artisan cheeses and other fine touches. The turkey melt had Havarti cheese and cranberries, which I thought was a nice combo. The goat hugger salad also was delicious with generous portions of feta and beets.

Service: Food delivered promptly and with a smile. They hire from disadvantaged populations which adds to the feel good vibe not mention they donate heavily to local non-profits

Price: On the high end but par for course in the artisan cafe world.

Overall: A great option for lunch when you're downtown that includes the feel-good factor that your contributing to a worthwhile social venture. Also check out Helpings if you're into cafes that donate back to the community."}
{"text":"Great place to get good food that's kid friendly. My 4 yr old loves the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Bomb grub that doesn't burn a hole in your pocket and a stellar atmosphere. More than comfortable and open late. Definitely coming back

The breakfast sandwich was phenomenal. Braised pork, fried eggs, and tots. Mmm. Gotta come check out Sunday Brunch with unlimited French toast! 

The place is very comfortable. Retro furniture and wall art gives this spot it's character, kinda like a beachside taco shop, etc. Super rad 

Close to home and easy to find, right off Rural just north of Dutch Bros. Will be here much more often"}
{"text":"My girlfriend had been wanting to try this place so we did. The environment is cool and the staff was helpful. but i didn't really enjoy my sandwich very much. It was mediocre."}
{"text":"This is the best damn sandwich place I've been to in old town! Highly recommend to come here!"}
{"text":"Well we have been waiting for over a month to visit this establishment and it was well worth the wait. My wife was sent....via email.....invitations to what was being called \"Veg Night Out \" with Even Stevens. Now being that this was Scottsdale I was concerned about parking even if this event was being held on a Thursday Night....however there was ample parking when I arrived around 6:45pm. The place is very quaint and in a very nice neighborhood in Old Town Scottsdale. The hostess and General manger along with one of the community advertising leaders were very pleasant.

Now for the food.....well this Night was dedicated to their Vegan and Vegetarian options and I have to say they were all very good. They had samples for all of their Vegan and Veggie options and the clear winner in my mind was the New Morrissey Burrito which is a breakfast item served all day. It has FAMOUSLY VEGAN. MEXICAN SOYRIZO, MARINATED TOFU, TOTS, ROASTED VEGGIES & HOUSE MADE GARLIC BRAVA. I highly recommend this delicious bundle of joy. Please go to the website.....check out the menu.....VEGANS can truly rejoice and the best part about this establishment is that for every sandwich they sell they donate one to the less fortunate in the community.....hence the name EVEN STEVENS.

If your in Scottsdale and need a Vegan or Veggie Fix.....plus contribute to a great cause.....EVEN STEVENS is your place. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends.

P.S. The Free WiFi is great too!!!!!"}
{"text":"Real meat. Real bread. Gourmet sauces and spreads. As good as a sandwich gets. It's like you used your own Sunday dinner and made the best leftover sandwich ever. Maybe not the healthiest choice, but if you're going to splurge, at least make your choice non-processed meats and cheeses."}
{"text":"Are lunch today, good vibe.  Pretty good sandwiches with creative toppings that appeared to be made in house.  Could use Fresh Iced Tea, bottled teas have to much sugar. Validation if parked in the garage above them would be nice."}
{"text":"Had such an amazing experience! The food is  amazing and the hospitality is uncomparable! Rhythm   was very welcoming and made us feel at home! Definitely the best sandwich shop around!"}
{"text":"We went to Even Steven's this afternoon, and it was fantastic! For starters they give free coffee for ASU students with your ID. The coffee is unlimited self serve. They have almond milk as an option too, which is great for non-dairy drinkers. 

I got the undergrad burrito with avocado. They don't charge extra for choosing avocado over meat, which is also great! My partner got the breakfast sandwich with bacon. We also got an order of party tots.

The party tots came out first and they were better than we were expecting. Not that they didn't sound delicious, but they were light and tasted healthy! My partner's breakfast sandwich came out first and he was surprised at how heavy it was. It was definitely hearty and he struggled to finish it! 

My burrito somehow got forgotten about, but they let me chose a cookie to make up for it. The burrito was so good I wasn't even bothered that it took awhile. The sauce inside it was delicious, and I've never tasted anything like it before (I think this was the Sriracha sauce). It was sweet but spicy. 

Overall we were really impressed, especially because they just opened. Sometimes openings can be kinda rough. I tend to eat vegetarian and they have a good amount of veg and vegan options! 

Oh and they also have a decent game selection and they made waiting fun!"}
{"text":"Had the Cuban sandwich and salad. Really enjoyed it. Service was fast and friendly.
Update: Came in again this morning to try a breakfast burrito. It was a few minutes after they opened and I was the only customer. Waited almost 20 minutes after ordering when someone finally told me they were waiting for the oven to warm up. Couldn't wait any longer and got a refund. Maybe warm up the oven before you open? Just a thought."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches, and even better atmosphere! They donate a sandwich for every sandwich that you buy! Eating good and doing good. Can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"At the soft opening and I have to say, it's going extremely well! Super friendly staff, very reasonable prices and the food is delicious. We tried a few and the sloppy joe (yummy chorizo) and the my hammy vice are absolutely delicious! I'm not much of a sandwich person but I will absolutely be back! It's got a really fun vibe and my favorite amenity, a dog friendly patio!! They have $3 mimosas for Sunday brunch.  I'm in!!"}
{"text":"When it comes to odds and evens I would choose Even Stevens every time. Hand crafted Sammies that will make your mouth water faster than a tropical rainstorm in the amazon jungle. If you are trying to be a little odd but are feeling a little even I would recommend Even Stevens"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, great food and a place with a cause to end hunger in our community! We you eat here, they donate to local non-profits to feed local families in need. Doesn't get better than that!"}
{"text":"Did you know that Even Stevens caters too! They still give a sandwich for every sandwich they sell on catering orders! They do not charge for delivery of catering orders which is a plus. Veggie platters, fruit platters, salads and their delicious sandwiches - couldn't ask for better! The do breakfast catering as well - try that next for the office."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I tried it yesterday and went back today for another dose of Even Stevens. I got their Cuban which has a cool fancy name and that was awesome and filling. Then this morning I got the breakfast burrito with bacon and the salsa that is served with it is so good! Their saucy tots or whatever they are called comes with three sauces including a spicy cream cheese which I really liked but steered away from because I had already went overboard. Overall a great place! The one thing I didn't like is that they displayed a $2 side and I was charged $2.95 and then I asked for avocado on my burrito and was charged but didn't receive any. I'm sure they would make it right but it's never fun having to let someone know they fudged up and complain about .95 cents. Just a little downfall for a great place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go! Best sandwiches in the state of Arizona no doubt! I take all the ladies here cause it's a guaranteed good experience. The workers are bad ass. 100% come here for a perfect dcperixeb"}
{"text":"The bread was excellent. The sandwich was pretty good. I had the miami vice aka cubano"}
{"text":"I've been seeing Even Steven's pop up all over the valley, so I decided it was time to drop by and see what it is. Very cool little setup, reminding me of a set taken from an Austin Powers film. I guess they were going for a 60s/70s ASU theme, and I was told by the very friendly and informative cashier that this would be changing. Hopefully they have something equally as original in mind. Also some pretty cool art up on the wall (I'll attach an photo I snapped of it). 

I didn't try any sandwiches, but instead went with the Party Tots, which are more-or-less nachos with tots in place of chips. They're not bad, though I think I'm ready to try a sandwich next time. And last but not least, I was informed that for every item purchased, they donate another to charity. I'm not sure how it all works but I like the way it sounds!"}
{"text":"Is there anything better than a delicious sandwich?  Fantastic ingredients, dynamite bread?  I would say there is not.  If you're a sandwich lover like me you have to try Even Stevens!  The whole vibe is awesome, comfortable and casual.  Even Stevens provides food to those in need.  Buy one, give one. I love this so much. I'll gladly eat here again and often and even pay a few extra dollars on the high side for a sandwich if this means I'm helping others.  The Bahn Mi was incredible.  The pork delightful.  The aioli a perfect compliment and the bread was divine.  I also ordered the shishito peppers and they were very good. I checked in on yelp and was given a complimentary cookie and the sugar cookie was incredible. This place is so good and I can't wait to return and try more fantastic sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches with a great cause! Don't miss Even Stevens!! I can't pass up a good sandwich any day, and certainly not when the restaurant is also donating to local food banks! The concept alone will get you in the door, and the hip environment and tasty sammies will keep you coming back! 

So far I have tried the pot roast dip, bahn mahi and mihami vice sandwiches. Everything was fantastic and fresh. Even Stevens does a good job of implementing unique ingredients, like jalapeño jelly, that are sourced locally. 

I cannot get over this place!"}
{"text":"Super hip vibes and very tasty food here at Even Stevens! I met the owner Michael and got to hear about Even Stevens' story and mission. I was very impressed with his passion for food and desire to benefit the surrounding neighborhoods. I love that Even Stevens gives back to the local community! More sandwiches for everyone!!!! They partner with local nonprofits to donate food to people in need (\"buy a sandwich, give a meal\"). They also pride themselves in supporting small local businesses through their inventory purchases. For example, all bread is sourced from a nearby bakery, all jams/jellies come from a family-owned operation, and their coffee comes from a small coffee shop in Chandler that brings the coffee beans directly from their family farm in Brazil!

The space itself is very open and airy; despite being packed with a dinner rush, I didn't feel crowded at all. The decorations and furniture create a welcoming atmosphere and a comfortable place to kick back with a friend. You can come for dinner, but rush - stay awhile and play a board game on the couch!

I ordered the pot roast dip sandwich. It was very delicious and rich. The sandwich was extra \"gourmet\" with fancy jalapeño jelly on top and dipping juice on the side. My boyfriend got the banh belly and really enjoyed that as well. We are excited for our next visit so we can try some other creations! All the sandwiches on the menu are unique and AFFORDABLE!! In this day and age of $15 burgers, it is refreshing to find a great sandwich place where I can eat well under $10.

Affordable, philanthropic and delicious. Can't top that!"}
{"text":"My first stop at Even Stevens. I ordered the Mihami Vice (aka Cuban) and my wife ordered the Pot Roast Dip. Both were very good but I did like the Pot Roast Dio better.  The jaleoeno jelly made the sandwich.  Be sure to ask the staff what they like best as they have several \"add one\" to the sandwiches they feel make them even better.   

I really like the fact that for every sandwich sold they donate a sandwich to 1 of 4 partners to distribute to the homeless.  What a great way to feed the homeless.  

My hats off to Even Stephens.   Why aren't more restaurants doing this?"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went there cause of the Yelp event I had attended a month or so prior.   I had the mac and cheese and tater tots at that event, and I like the fact they contribute money towards worthy causes for every sandwich bought.

I had the mac and cheese again -- It was so tasty from the time prior -- and we shared the party tots.   They were as yummy as ever, of course.  As stated in my prior review, the guacamole tends to make the tots soggy; therefore, I set it to the side as we ate the tots.   The bacon is a very nice addition.   The sour cream, to me not so much albeit my daughter liked it.   I thought it was too sour.  My mac and cheese was the best of course, especially after I gave it a good squeeze of the Sriracha sauce.   Yummm!!

She had the breakfast burrito, which has the tots in it as well.   It comes with sausage, tots, scrambled eggs all rolled up in a tortilla.   I am not a fan of breakfast burritos although I did try it.  Not bad.

She said she'd definitely go there again but do takeout.   (She's a fan of takeout!)   I'd go there again, of course.  I probably should try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I really like the concept of the community and establishment giving back however, I was a little disappointed with the quality of my food. In the end, it was fairly expensive for what we received. We actually had to have the kitchen remake our food."}
{"text":"My sandwich was fresh and tasty. The staff was helpful, attentive, and friendly. The ambiance is comfortable, but a little cold. Not cozy, but still a place I would consider having a quick lunch. Food was a little salty, but I liked the taste."}
{"text":"Took the family here for lunch - First thing I noticed was how affordable their prices were. I have a family of five (5) so eating out can get very expensive.. Honestly, I chose this location based on the previous Yelp reviews; it did not disappoint. 

Great food, great atmosphere, very clean inside. We advised our waitress that it was our first time here; she proceeded to give us a full on debriefing of the company history and how the process of their donations worked (this was really cool). 

I will be back, family and all - 4.5 Stars out of 5."}
{"text":"Second time here and it's becoming one of my favorite go to places for sandwiches. 

Their atmosphere is pretty laid back and open. I like the mixture of tables and lounge couches and chairs. Great place for a casual breakfast/lunch. 

The first time I was here I didn't have high expectations because it was just a sandwich place. I ordered their JP Grilled cheese. It was love at first bite. 

Not only if their food delicious but they give back with every purchase to help feed those in need. It's a win win!"}
{"text":"Even Stevens is a great concept and by the looks of it's taking off in many cities!  Don't let the Buy One, Give One idea lead you down the skeptic isle, the food totally holds its own, it's well priced and no Even Stevens venues are identical!

I just ran into one of their GM's by luck at a Starbucks and decided to sit down and have a chat. (he was geared out from head to toe in ES gear... which by the way, they make pretty sweet shirts)  He gave me the scoop on the concept idea, and that every location they open, the interior is designed on its local traits and history!  How cool is that?

Why go there:
The sandwiches are just awesome, it's well priced and what comes with it will make your meal worth it for the $10-$12.  They are fast and consistent.  All locations support local food banks and other charities close by.  It's just an awesome thing to be part of simply by eating there.

Don't miss:
The pun'd crown jewel of the place: The Do Gouda.  

5 stars y'all keep up the good work.  Yelpers, check in and get a free cookie!"}
{"text":"Woohoo! A great addition to the West Valley... finally! Stop by and hear Even Steven's story and what their Eat/Give \"mantra\" is all about.  Got to see Mr. Steven himself on opening day which is great to know that the founder is not too cool to hang where his stores open!

Why go there:
For one, their staff at all Even Steven's locations are unbelievably friendly, think Dutch Bros' staff just less on the annoying side. The food is great, they have an eclectic menu with unique items for a sandwich shop.  This location has a Peoria/West Valley subtle theme to it (if you look for it).  And of course this place stands for something pretty awesome with its buy one give one model. Ask for their GM, Jason, he'll give you the specifics of how they work with local non-profits, it's actually brilliant!

Don't Miss: 
Their Do-Gouda sandwich, that's the crown jewel I believe, oh and they have the best ice hands down, paired with one of those thousand flavor fancy soda machines.

Tip:
Breakfast person? They do it all day. Eat your heart out Mickey D's.

Bon Ap!"}
{"text":"I got the Mihami-vice. The order area is a little different. Maybe it works better for when they are busy. The dining area has plenty of space. I liked the pop art idea they have. I also liked the option of a salad instead of chips. Good portion for the money."}
{"text":"We love Even Stevens. For the food, the cost, and for the greater good.

Every sandwich purchased donates another to the local non-profit partners that ES works with (Operations Care Food Bank, Tempe Community Action Agency, Tumbleweed Center for Youth Development, and UMOM).

So if you want to grow your community involvement, and sate your hunger, Even Stevens has you covered."}
{"text":"Cool vibe and good food. Set an online order for 8 breakfast burritos at 715am pickup. Didn't walk-out with food until 730, which is frustrating because I was on a timeline. Would possibly order again but give yourself plenty of time."}
{"text":"This location opened this weekend. ok , went to try as menu seemed good.
I ordered a ruben sandwich. took forever for our order to arrive.
the meat was JUST A PIECE OF FAT...REALLY FAT...NO MEAT...JUST FAT..
The marbled rye bread...great..the cheese...actually was on there...along with cole slaw.

the service was great and they tried to please and really nice to see they donate to great
causes. just avoid first weekend openings and they claim they cook and cut their own stuff.
so boy..they need to find a better product and not put a piece of fat on the sandwich..
ugh...
will be a while before I try them again."}
{"text":"Great sandwich place! They have some of the most friendliest staff I have ever met! They talk to me every time I come and it's never any annoying, forceful small talk which is unnecessary. It's true and genuine. The place has a great atmosphere. Never very busy either. I'm a vegetarian so I'm happy they have options for me and they have a little selection for vegans as well. The best sandwich they have in my opinion is the Hummazing Vegan! It's what I get every time I come here. The prices are a little high for sandwiches but when you get amazing value and fresh ingredients, who can complain?! I'll never stop supporting this place. The sandwiches also go to a good cause which I think everyone can get behind."}
{"text":"This is probably one my favorite places to eat in the Arcadia neighborhood.
The people who work here are friendly and courteous.
There concept of business is awesome,before long I will know what everyone's name is.
I love you guys."}
{"text":"There are special circumstances where the realms of quality and quanity collide, and this place, on the time I visited for Sunday brunch, was such an occasion.

I don't know how to peg the style of food they do here other than it is a little bit of everything. Cultural appropriation, but in a good way. I got their burrito and it was big, piping hot, and pretty darn good. Their salsa aint to shabby either, more on the cool refreshing side as to the go get the fire extinguisher kind.Three dollar mimosas and ayce French toast at 5 bucks for the table was quite nice as well. 

The space is big, clean and well lit. They have some board games you can peruse, and also live music as well. We stayed for neither, but the atmosphere was a welcoming one, where kicking back and taking it slow was something that you could tell would not be frowned upon, unlike other places. 

Overall, solid food and a solid spot for a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"We recently tried this new restaurant and I left a bit disappointed. We ordered one of the chicken sandwiches with a side salad and the hummazing vegan with chips and pickle on the side. The bread on the hummazing was kinda gross and weird. They advertise that it has avocado but it was more like a thin spread. It also had some kind of salad dressing on the sandwich that isn't on the menu that I could've done without. Veggies seemed fresh but I definitely wouldn't order the hummazing again. Also, my chips were like the smashed up dregs at the bottom of the bag and they forgot my pickle. The chicken sandwich was much better all around. If I return, I'll definitely try a different sandwich and get a side salad rather than the chips. Also, they are offering 1/2 sandwiches with a nicer salad or soup but only offer one kind of soup. I'd love to see them offer a few flavors of soup."}
{"text":"My first time here, Mihami Vice sandwhich was absolutely delicious, so were the peanut butter cookies sampled. I will definitely be back to try the french toast!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for brunch before driving back to San Diego. First thing you will notice is the cool decor/ layout of this place. Makes you want to hang out for a while.

I enjoyed the Reuben with a side salad that was delicious and my gal got the stuffed french toast. 

Awesome food, reasonably priced, and they give to charity. I can dig that."}
{"text":"My best friend happens to work here, so I was spoiled enough to be invited to the friends and family night prior to them opening for business. I had never heard of this place before, but free food and good company and I am there! He also told me he would explain the concept upon arrival. I wasn't exactly sure what to make of that!

first off, parking does suck. but it downtown so I guess every place sucks for parking! the place is pretty small, tucked in a corner unit under a parking garage. Super cute décor (we were lucky enough to meet their designer who is insanely talented I might add). I really liked the simplicity of the menu, some times too many options aren't a good thing. 

I got the sprang chicken sandwich minus the greens, which comes with a side of chips. the food was amazing. it tasted great, and also like I was eating something healthy for once. Generous portion too, I felt. Price point is right where everyone else is at. They do have a kids menu, but as of prior to opening it was on a small menu board behind the register, not their large one posted on the wall. Again, fair prices and generous portion on that as well.

the best part of a place like this is not only do they have great food, they have a great cause as well. for every sandwich you purchase, one is donated to one of 4 (I think) companies they are partnered with. For once, I wont feel guilty being a pig and ordering more than I should! 

great food, location, people and cause? a win all around, Rae will be back!!!"}
{"text":"We tried this place today and loved it!! From the welcoming staff, great environment and amazing food we highly recommend going here. 

We tried different sandwiches and enjoyed them both very much. They offer many choices for drinks and the local San Tan Beer is also available here. 

The very roomy seating, open windows and comfy couch set up makes it a great place to not only eat, but we enjoyed hanging out finishing our drinks while our son played with the wooden checkers. 

In addition they have a amazing cause. For every sandwich purchased, Even Stevens donates one to a local non-profit. Now that is something I !! 

We will return to Even Stevens again!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times so far and tried to get a different item or two each time. I am very happy with the food! My favorite so far is the Cuban. Dining room is clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. Great experience each time."}
{"text":"Enjoyed it! We went on a Friday evening and the live music and delicious sandwich made my day! The service was great as well. I wish the sandwich was bigger haha. The jackfruit sandwich was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"We've visited this location 4 times since they opened and overall it's been good with very friendly staff. The Turkey Day sandwich has been my favorite so far with the cran-peño jelly and tomato spread. But I've experienced a few minor inconsistencies. For example, today the chips with my sandwich were mostly bottom of the bag crumbs instead of full pieces, and they were out of iced tea, which would have been nice to know before ordering a drink because I don't want soda. Also, I think they really should tell people when ordering, that the Banh Mi sandwich which is described on the menu as \"Soy Glazed Pork\", is actually Pork Belly and mostly just fat. The website is correct but the menu in the restaurant is not, so that sandwich was a waste of $9 unfortunately. But overall I think this will become one of our favorite lunch stops and I'm excited to try all the different sandwiches."}
{"text":"Way cool new place to eat in Downtown Gilbert. I had a little trouble finding it, it's a little bit off of Gilbert Road behind other restaurants in a square. Loved the decor and met the Manager (very nice guy), they have a great selection of unique and delicious subs and sandwiches and even Breakfast Burritos. The staff was very helpful and I love their mission of every sub you buy they give one to charity. I had the Pot Roast Dip, it was great and can't wait to try others on the menu!"}
{"text":"Loooove this place ! Went for breakfast , the stuffed French toast and their breakfast sandwich are to die for ! Fun 70's theme with vintage games to play at your table if you'd like (kept my 3 year old entertained). Excellent and very quick service . Will definitely be  back for lunch soon ."}
{"text":"This is our first time at EvenStevens and the sandwiches were phenomenal! They taste as good or even better than the picture. It looks very clean, it has a Cool vibe and like the industrial/vintage feel.I also love that they donate the sandwiches purchased to charities! There were two girls/servers one was super friendly always making sure we were doing ok and the other one seemed flustered and on her phone (that's the only thing I didn't like)."}
{"text":"This is more than just a sandwich shop! It's great priced gourmet sandwiches with a great cause. 

Staff was super friendly and outgoing. They were all on their A game for this event. 

The food was great, and the sides were delicious. 

Vibe was awesome, and decor was cool. Concept of the restaurant is killer.

Can not wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and enjoyed the sandwiches.  The staff however is so laid back that I often have to serve myself.  They are friendly, informative and courteous, but seem to have so much fun with each other that my service is delayed.  Portions are ample and come with a bit of pickle and side of your choice.  I endorse their philantrophic efforts and will return.  The menu changes a little but the favorites are always available."}
{"text":"been here a few times now and the sandwiches have been *really* good every time. I can concur with other reviews on the issue of the atmosphere being a little too hipster/millenial, which just feels unprofessional at times but they are nice and helpful. They do have other issues they need to get worked out 1) everytime I go there it is freezing in there, 2) more often than not the coke freestyle machine is on the fritz, 3) yes, I agree that their chips seem like Lay's, which is pretty unoriginal, and 4) why am i asked to give a tip when i pay for the food when no one has served me yet? Tips are based on quality of service and not necessarily obligatory. The sandwiches, though. So, so good. Food generally comes out fast too. I will keep coming if they can grow into something better, but if they stagnate, I'll probably go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try this place... friendly quick service, great food and a comfortable trendy open industrial environment to eat! We will return:)"}
{"text":"Needed some food to start my day, so I grabbed a breakfast burrito.  So, so, good.  Nice big place with a welcoming atmosphere.  I can't wait to come back for lunch."}
{"text":"The sandwiches and service was really good. The parking situation is a total disaster!!!"}
{"text":"We go here all the time. I'm not sure what they put in the French toast, but it's awesome. Try the pot roast dip sandwich. It's super good. My wife gets the salad with the granola and she swears it's the best granola she's ever had."}
{"text":"Stopping through Scottsdale and we randomly piped into this spot! I am so stoked on everything here! I had the breakfast sandwich and devoured it instantly. The vibe is amazing. We came in on a Sunday and the musical guest was so incredibly talented. I've never enjoyed music in a restaurant and he blew us away! Come here eat here fall inlove! Omg and every time you buy a sandwich they donate a sandwich to someone in need! I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now for lunch. The food is pretty good, they have a unique take on most of their menu items and the flavors are unique. Today I got the chicken berry and oats salad, and they replaced the granola with pecans and didn't ask me beforehand. When I asked for the granola they were like meh sorry, were out. No offer for any type of compensation or an apology. The chicken also wasn't warm like It was last time. Kind of have a bad taste in my mouth from the experience and not sure if/when I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to sample some items from Even Stevens last year. Since then, I have been wanting to go back. Especially after learning about them giving a sandwich to someone in need for every sandwich purchased. 

I do recall tasting bites of sandwiches, however, I do not recall it tasting so delicious. I am not big on sandwiches these days but in trying to figure where to eat I suggested we check it out. I am SO glad we did! I was surprised that it wasn't busier, although we were a while after lunch time. I was stoked they had some beers to choose from. I decided to try the Bahn mi sandwich on a whim, the dude got the Gouda and the lil one had a pb and j. We were all happy with out selections. I was so impressed with mine that I was only willing to share how good I though it was. I wasn't about to share any bites because I wanted it all. I was a bit worried I wouldn't like the pork because it appeared to be a bit under but not was I wrong! It was smokey, it was cooked and it was delicious. 

One note their house dressing is a bit pungent for my taste and though it was delicious I did find it slightly overpowering. Not enough to lose any star rating though. 

I will be back. I like that they also display the sandwiches given back to the community inside. I felt that helps to give an idea of their impact. Super great concept, super great food!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop In downtown Gilbert. Every sandwich you buy gives back to the community. Tried there chicken sandwich and party tots.  Have to say it was pretty solid. They also have some legit coffee from a local shop in chandler. Price is pretty average. It's one of the cheaper options in downtown Gilbert. It still has great quality though!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great new place in the West Valley! They have so many vegan options from jackfruit torta to the new morrisey burrito! I would highly suggest the new morrisey burrito,it has such great flavor without any animal products! Thank you for the gift cards to come back and eat again. Service was spot on!"}
{"text":"Came on the soft opening night. Grand opening is Wednesday 4/26. Had a taste of everything. Husband got the Gouda sandwich and I got the Cubano. Would definitely recommend any sandwich with the French bread...delicious! You get a choice of chips or a side salad, both are good! Was hoping for more of a kettle chip though.

$1 coors & coors lights! All. The. Time. :)

Stuffed French toast was good, nothing spectacular. They put a ton of berries on top so that won me over! Coffee was super delicious, I heard it was local, out of Chandler. They passed around samples of cookies. OH MY GOD. Get them! You won't be disappointed! 

If you're vegan, this place is the place to go! They have a bunch of vegan options. AND they have almond milk for coffee creamer...yes! 

Will definitely return. Staff is young, so I gave them a little bit of a break. Has a nice outdoor area, with seating and even puppy water bowls!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches! Just a hidden location. Make sure to play their board games while you're in here! Have some fun!!"}
{"text":"I am incredibly disappointed in my experience with Even Stevens resturants.

The resturant is very cutesy and convenient, it's right by all the music venues so it was semi crowded when we went. It was a clean facility, and the staff were pleasant to deal with. 

When I went up to order, I ordered a basic sandwich and asked what sides they offered. She told me all the sides, and I picked the fruit cup. Little known to me, it was $2 extra. Which was NOT told to me. And not on a sign that I could clearly see (I will admit, I'm visually impaired). 

I shrugged it off and sat down, my friend ordered and had the same thing happen, not being told what sides are extra. 

When we got our food, we were happy with the portions but both of our sides were incredibly lackluster. 

The Mac and cheese she ordered was LUKEWARM! Not even hot, it was a small small portion of it. We were in rush so we did not complain. Plus staff was nowhere to be found at this point.

My fruit was not worth $2, the blueberries were very mushy, the pineapple was good but it had such small slices. 

Afterwards, we both started to feel ill. Our stomachs were extremely upset. We both ordered the same sandwich (I forgot the name but I do know it was the chicken one).

I expected more from Even Stevens due to its high reviews. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This fast-casual sandwich shop is quickly becoming our go-to when both the fridge and our stomachs are empty. We enjoy the friendly service staff, the food, and the live music; but not so much the heavy metal dining chairs which were unnecessarily uncomfortable. 

The pricing seems fair on most items. We've tried the Sprang Chicken (as good as it sounds) and have fallen hard for the breakfast burritos. I might even use the L word to describe them. They're a large size like Chipotle's burritos so you could possibly split one especially if you add a second meat. 

A curbside takeout service would earn 5 stars but for now my (unfortunately) disabled legs still have to haul me inside for pickup."}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**

At least half of the sandwiches on their menu are vegetarian! I love that their menu indicates what is vegetarian or vegan.

I tasted the Capreezy sandwich from my friend, and that was just as delicious. You could taste the basil from the pesto.

Entree: Hummazing Vegan
Just as it's called...it was hummazzzingg. All the flavors complimented each other very well. 

I will be back for brunch! Unlimited french toast...how can anyone say no?!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! I had the reuben, my wife had the Sprang Chicken. We had two other ones that were great as well. Cool atmosphere and friendly staff. My favorite part is that the sandwiches come with a side salad so even though some sandwiches may not have any veggies (like the reuben) you get your dose of greens."}
{"text":"I went today for the first time. Love this place!
Knowing your purchase is helping feed others is 
Priceless. 
Please check out Even Stevens. Fresh ingredients
And tastes delicious. 
Check it out!"}
{"text":"Lazy AF for opening at 9am. But the sandwiches are fire when they actually cook the hash browns."}
{"text":"Stopped in after getting accidentally stranded and waiting for a ride! Was super hungry, saw Even Stevens Sandwiches and have been meaning to try it for a while now! Was helped out by a small woman manning the cash register and she was suuuper sweet! She gave me a free drink since she could tell it was my first time so I'm thinking she has to be either a manager or an owner.
I ordered a Mihami Vice or the Cubano.. Super delicious!!! 

And the place itself is really amazing. You won't be able to stop looking around.. music was on point as well! 5 stars! Will have to stop in again :)"}
{"text":"This is our second time here while in AZ and loved it! 1st time we had the Cuban sandwiches for dinner and they where great! Today we had breakfast and the burritos and French toast where  on point! You can taste the fresh ingredients I personally loved the salsa that came with the burrito!  Oh and the service is fast and friendly!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service! Love the environment. Employees go above and beyond for their customers. Food was served quick and tasted fresh. 

The only concern I have is for parking in the area. I was literally eating inside for 30 minutes and came out to my car. It had a yellow tow away sticker on it. Worried to park there next time as my car might actually get towed away!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service with a great cause behind the business. Let's just say we went there twice within 24 hours because the food and experience was THAT good!"}
{"text":"Order the pot roast sandwich on sourdough bread. All your wildest dreams will come true!"}
{"text":"This place is so hip! I was so surprised when I walked in.  I had never heard of this place until one had opened up in my neighborhood. The decor is retro and we loved it! We also learned they are not only a place to eat but they help a great cause! Donating sandwiches to non-profits! Awesome!
I was very impressed with how many vegan and vegetarian items they had. 
I got the Humazing vegan sandwich and my husband got the dip. 
The vegan sandwich was so good! It had hummus and veggies on this amazing grain bread! Loved the salad on the side and the pickle was a nice touch. 
My husbands dip looked so good! He loved the jalapeño relish! In the middle of eating he also loved that they did scrimp on the portion! He loved it! 
This will be our new sandwich spot for sure! It's such a fresh take on all the usual sandwich shops on every corner."}
{"text":"Love the food, cool space and concept but the push for tips is shameless.   Myself and coworkers all agree the food and prices are great!  When you're about to check out it feels like your entire moral being is in question:"}
{"text":"Was so inspired after meeting the owners and learning about Even Stevens great philanthropic work that my sister and I had to try the sandwiches. Stopped by and was not disappointed! Phenomenal meals and service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Their menu is awesome, it's the perfect combination of laid back and professional. I've tried a whole bunch of things and never been disappointed, but I heavily recommend the pot roast dip sandwich."}
{"text":"Great selection of sandwiches salads and small bites! Food is amazing, especially for the price. Staff was super friendly...came out to talk to us numerous times during our meal. It's also for a great cause - for every purchase, they help feed the hungry. Would definitely recommend this place! We got the BLT salad, peppers, Brussels sprouts and tots... all for $22. You should go here!"}
{"text":"We have gotten food from here twice so far, and both experiences have been excellent. 
My boyfriend has gone in both times so I can't personally speak to their customer service, but he says that everybody was very friendly and knowledgeable. I have a gluten allergy and they were very accommodating to that as well. 
We've tried two of the three vegan options, and both of them were amazing. The New Morrissey Burrito was great, but the Jackfruit Torta has been our favorite so far. They also have vegan brava sauce for their tater tots which is delicious. 
The prices are also reasonable considering the portion sizes.
Overall, this place is great for vegans, and I'm sure the other options are just as delicious. 
We were really happy to hear that they also have a Tucson location, but we definitely will make it a point to stop into this location whenever we are in the area."}
{"text":"This place is worth your time, money, and attention.  Not only do they offer quality food but on top of that quality service. I have tried 6 of their sandwhiches so far and never regretted a purchase. They give you chips or salad with your sandwhich and you are free to add on more for an upcharge. They're breakfast burritos are also incredible for the price value. They sold me a PORK BELLY breakfast burrito for only $7.49 when any, ANY other place that has a decent burrito would go right for the $10.99 price. They also make a DAMN good Pico De Galio, their PARTY TOTS are a STEAL for the value and also iIf its anything, they sell you a beer for $1.00 (it may be Coors but seriously, $1 for a beer? Good fucking luck getting something cheaper in the area, let me tell you, all of the bars in the area does NOT have a beer that cheap for sale and if you say so then you better link up some pictures.). Lets not forget the live music they have on occasion, the super friendly staff, and welcoming atmosphere. To top it ALL OFF they donate every sandwich sold to charity, gee, can't feel guilty spending my money now :) Thanks Even Stevens, now when I go other restaurants in the area I feel like I am cheating on you."}
{"text":"Even though this is my first time trying this out It  deserves 10 stars . My goodness, the best bacon macaroni and cheese I have ever had. I ordered to the jack fruit sandwich with a side of chips . Most delicious sandwich on there menu . FIRE.  Consider ordering two ."}
{"text":"I really love the Even Steven's concept, their stores really are super cute and customer service is something they've really nailed. The food just isn't my favorite. I was in Scottsdale for a work conference so breakfast was brought into the office. I ordered the Undergrad Breakfast Burrito  (scrambled eggs, ham and avocado, no tots or Sriracha sauce). Burrito's don't always hold very well...but this one did! I just didn't love the combo- since tots somehow made their way into my breakfast burrito and the avocado isn't really avocado, it's more of a puree of sorts. For me, breakfast is the most important meal of the day...and the offerings at Even Steven's don't really fit the bill for a nutritious and balanced breakfast. If you like tater tots and sriracha sauce, then you'll surely like their breakfast burritos. It's just not a combo I personally like."}
{"text":"The sandwiches and salads are amazing, healthy and packed full of flavor. This is my 2nd experience and it didn't disappoint!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great! The staff was so nice and definitely excited to be there. The food was great, I had a breakfast burrito. Their salsa is different than I have ever had before. Really good. The location is a little hidden but definitely worth a try! They are out for a great cause too, but one sandwich and one gets given to someone in need. Love it."}
{"text":"This place is so cool! We stopped in for lunch today. The staff is on top of it and really happy! The couch areas are super vintage and neat AND the food is great. Hummazing and Capreezy are awesome! 

Oh, and the best part, they donate to local nonprofits for every purchase in the shops, how cool is that? We'll be back, for sure."}
{"text":"I am in love with Even Stevens. Hubby and I ordered the Do Gouda sandwich and Brussels sprouts and everything was tasty. Can you please open a location around the PV mall please?!"}
{"text":"I ordered the 1/2 sandwich with 1/2 salad and a drink. I got the reuben sandwich and it was yummy although not exceptional, but I expected the salad portion to be a little bigger. It also comes with chips. The place is nice inside, you order and sit down, waiters deliver your food. I guess they're aiming for that hipster vibe.I was a little upset because I ordered the blueberry steel salad which comes with feta cheese but instead It had blue cheese which I always try to avoid for its strong flavor and don't understand because there was about two other customers besides me(on a Tuesday around 2 pm). A little pricy for me, not in a rush to visit again."}
{"text":"I really love this place and the great options they have. As a vegetarian there's so many options which I appreciate. I had the jackfruit torta which was very tasty! The service is always great and it's a nice atmosphere. I am going to be going back often!"}
{"text":"The food was really good but hella expensive.  We got two sandwiches, two drinks, a bowl of soup, and free cookie for checking in on yelp.  Our total was $30! It is really good, but unless I'm ever in the neighborhood, I doubt I'll stop in again.  Not to mention, we had to wait a really long time just to order our food. I love that they give back to the community too!"}
{"text":"The first time we went there I couldn't wait to go back. The second time we threw our food away as it was so dry and nothing like we'd had our first time around. Not willing to give it another shot."}
{"text":"I'd add an expensive star or two to the price guide. At $10 per sandwich (no drinks) this place is more expensive than the 1 star price I was expecting. The decor and feeling of the place is really nice though and the place is open and airy.  Wow the sand which is really good though. I had the Cuban and it was piled high and excellent. Tip tho don't get this to go. By the time I ate it the bread was soggy from the jus (although still really good) and I imagine it would have been excellent fresh in the restaurant.  4 stars because if quality but not 5 because too expensive."}
{"text":"What a groovy place. Had the Sprang Chicken which comes with chicken, greens, bacon, cucumber, tomato and a tasty house made honey mustard sauce all on whole grain toasted bread. Pretty dang tasty! We shared the party tots which were just okay and the bread dipped in beer cheese. Very intensely beer flavored. By checking in we got a free cookie as well! Certainly a friendly staff and a clean restaurant. Plus every sandwich bought provided a donated sandwich to non profits that help others get some good tasting food. Good experience in this hipster downtown gilbert location. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Just what we needed in downtown!  Casual, family-friendly & delicious!  We're going back for the Sunday brunch & $4 unlimited French toast. Really enjoyed the openness and overall vibe of this place."}
{"text":"Good take away salad. Try the Hulk, mint lemonade tea! Service can be slow at peak times"}
{"text":"Went to this place yesterday, Very nice service, toys for kids to play with and good food. I tried the vegan torta...first time eating anything vegan and I was surprised it was really good. My son had mac and cheese which was also pretty good, boyfriend had a turkey sandwich that he enjoyed, and my sister had a really good chicken sandwich...overall, I thought it was a great place and definitely recommend to any sandwich lovers out there."}
{"text":"Still the best Reuben I have ever had. Having been to the location in Idaho a dozen times I had to visit here as well. I love that when you  buy a sandwhich they give one, feel good all around. My family loves this place, and appreciate how clean the dining area is. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Perfect location right off the light rail, friendly staff, and a cool atmosphere (this location even has an arcade game) with great music. The JP grilled cheese I got was pretty good but nothing to write home about, I'm also glad I got it with chicken added as that definitely added to it. I would definitely come back, hopefully there's plans for more sandwich options in the future though!"}
{"text":"Overpriced small sandwiches.  They taste good, but you'll still want more and unfortunately there won't be any left.  All for $10 or so.  Too much!"}
{"text":"I had forgotten about the new Even Stevens location here in the West Valley until I was driving by and decided to stop in. I tried various sandwich samples from Yelp events so I wasn't too surprised about their menu selections. I decided on the Sprang chicken with chips and a fountain drink.

Side note: they have the soda machine like AMC does where you are able to pick different sodas/flavors. Also if you check in on Yelp you also get a free cookie! My pink sugar cookie had way too much frosting on it but there are other options. 

The sandwich was decent. I honestly picked this one because of the avocado, however it was avocado spread instead of avocado slices. Also the avocado spread was so thin on the bread slice that it was practically non-existent. So $9 is pretty pricey for the sandwich IMO 

What I do LOVE about Even Stevens is their mission for giving back. For every sandwich purchased, X amount of sandwich is then donated to a non-profit organization! Kudos to that"}
{"text":"I've now been to this Evens Stevens location a few times and it never disappoints! All of the sandwiches are delicious- my favorite three being the Cubano, Bahn Mi and the Gouda. The cookies are soft and chewy and easily melt in your mouth. I also enjoy the tots, which are lightly dusted with a spice blend that is very flavorful. 

Everyone on staff is incredibly friendly and service is prompt. I feel that the pricing is accurate for the portion size (which will easily fill you). 

Tip: Go through the side entrance as the main entrance is off of a sidewalk and requires you to step up and into the restaurant. I've now accidentally tripped three times because I never can remember!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible! I went to the soft opening a couple of weeks ago with friend who was hired here, and I almost missed the opportunity because I was sleeping! I have stuck to a rigorous diet for more than a year now so I can continue to improve my body, and I usually have one meal a week where I can go outside the realm of \"Whole-Grain\", veggies, or lean meat. So giving any new place a try is extremely difficult for me because I want the best possible treat that isn't going to make me wait for the next Friday in grueling agony as I eat quick oats and protein powder the rest of the time. 

I ordered the Party Tots and the \"Do Gouda\" sandwich, and felt awful for not taking the chance to order the french toast which looks phenomenal. The tots themselves were all cooked with that crunch you need in a potato, and the toppings themselves complimented the salty-ness of the tots. 

When the sandwich arrived, I noticed that it was a very good size with a good bit of kettle cooked chips along with it. I bit into it, and I shed a tear because of how perfect everything worked together in the sandwich. The sourdough was toasted with an all-around crunch, and no where on the bread did it look like part of it was burnt. The meat itself is not close to your ideal roast beef, and is instead so tender that it comes across as an extremely well marinated and slow cooked steak. What threw me over the edge was the combination of the salty steak with the sweet onion marmalade. It reminded me of back East where I would eat a bratwurst with homemade jam, because the salty-ness of the brat and sugary jelly brought out each of the opposite's best qualities. Not to mention that the sandwich in its presentation was aesthetically pleasing.

This sandwich was memorable to say the least, and I have been thinking about this place every time I want a treat meal. You cannot go wrong with any thing here, and if you're like me where you can only indulge every so often, be confident that you won't lose a meal here!"}
{"text":"Everything was extremely tasty! I got the Pot Roast Dip with chips and my husband got the Breakfast Sandwich with tots. A couple of things to note to this new establishment: 1. My baguette on the Pot Roast Dip was soggy on the bottom so it made the sandwich even more messy! 2. While I enjoyed the jalapeño jelly, it was a bit overpowering to the rest of the sandwich and was more spicy that savory as Pot Roast suggests. Next time I order it I will have to ask for light jelly. Everything else from the way the employees treated us, to the cookies was a great experience overall"}
{"text":"It was out first time there, and the girl at the door was so helpful and friendly. The entire experience was great. The food was so good. Since I work at Dunkin Donuts down town I will be there more often."}
{"text":"Love this place. The fact that they offer vegan, vegetarian and meat options is perfect for my family!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the Brady Bunch living room! I just loved the 70's interior of Even Stevens and could have spent more time just hanging out and listening to the music. 
I love that they are sandwiches with a cause, and give back to the community.
I very much enjoyed my Rueben sandwich which had the perfect amount of meat and was toasted perfectly. Hubby enjoyed a Cubano sandwich and we also tried the mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was a disappointment, as it didn't have any flavor. But the overall feeling of eating a great meal at a wonderful place left us full and feeling groovy!"}
{"text":"Super yummy sandwiches! We had the Do Gouda and the turkey sandwich, can't recall the actual name but both were great. Kids Mac n cheese was good and not served piping hot, which is like a no brainer that most other restaurants can't seem to figure out. The staff was friendly, atmosphere was cool, and I love the idea of donating to a cause all while eating good food!"}
{"text":"In town visiting for the Final Four and stopped in for breakfast.  Limited items for breakfast but my sandwich (over medium eggs, pork belly, avocado, cheddar, maple mustard on Hawaiian bun) was really good, service was great, and atmosphere was cool and laid back."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place while staying downtown. What a wonderful concept! Delicious food with a great cause!! For every purchase they donate food to the local food banks. We had the yummy stuffed French Toast and a breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"I love the cause!  Even Stevens came from my home state, and I've been here a few times.  

But, to me the cause alone is not enough to make me love this place.   The food to me, is just... OK.   Not terrible, not outstanding.   

Try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff food and drinks were amazing. Super kid friendly! Love the layout of the place. They have some adult and kid friendly games to play with while you wait for your food. Love it!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! I don't mind paying a little extra for sandwiches that taste so great and fresh, have perfect customer service, and donate to the hungry and needy!"}
{"text":"I tried this place the other day and boy was I impressed. I am a HUGE fan of sandwiches so I came in expecting a critical evaluation. 

I am happy to report their sandwiches are not great. They are PHENOMENAL. I had a Cuban and it may have been the best Cuban sandwich I have ever experienced! 

In addition, their design and space was open inviting and friendly, and is a very convenient place to meet people and close to free parking."}
{"text":"This place is a great stop in for lunch or small bites and a beer, and the giving back aspect of purchase is a nice sentiment that is rarely seen anymore.

The cashier suggested a lot of things, and I can of just went for it. Brussel Sprouts (Delicious) Hummus (Pretty Good) and French Toast (Mediocre)

The beer also being 2 bucks is a big win, and tasty. The 1 dollar beer is a winner always as well.

Cool spot, worth a visit or two!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is not the forte here. Maybe lunch is better? What I did like was the old school board games available to play, Guess Who, and other memory makers. I also liked their cause of giving back to the community, that rocks!"}
{"text":"This location is quaint and everyone is extremely friendly. It's a great place to stop for lunch. When you walk in, you order at the counter, pay, get a number, and sit down. Their sandwiches are great, there hasn't been one I haven't liked. I am not a huge fan of their side salad. When I first started coming here I enjoyed it so I'm not sure if they changed it up or what. Overall, great location in downtown and you can usually find a parking spot in the ramp."}
{"text":"This is literally the most amazing sandwich's I've ever had in my life. And I love a good sandwich. I had their pot roast sandwich with jalapeno jelly... It was a orgasm in my mouth. Not even kidding. I'm going to come here every week for the rest of my life. I'm seriously coming back on Sunday for unlimited French toast"}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwiches.

Not sandwich just for breakfast, but sandwich that has all the breakfast stuff done right in one sandwich. Their buns - mcgriddle style with the syrup infused,but burger king style with the croissant texture, must appreciate. 

Also on point is their grilled cheese and tomato soup.

If there was a place for anonymous comment cards, I would say please fry the tator tots longer."}
{"text":"Ate here in Salt Lake City and was excited when I found out they were coming to the valley. Ordered the Do Gouda and enjoyed every bite! Plus they give back to the community by donating sandwich for sandwich! It's a must try!!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife have been in here several times and everything from their breakfast burritos to their Reuben (my personal favorite) has all been consistently excellent. It's a shame there is always so few people whenever we stop by. But I hope that changes soon!"}
{"text":"Loved it, we were just passing by to eat at Bourbon Jacks, but stopped in to check out the menu and it looked great. I had the pot roast dip with a salad and my fiancé had the sprang chicken with chips. Both very delicious and full of flavor, I also love that it's local and supports nonprofit organization. Check it out, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Not bad for a late evening nosh. Food is good and vegetarian friendly! Their shishito peppers and tots are favorites! Check-in for your cookie!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian breakfast/brunch--yay! Surprisingly tasty. Their tomato soup is delicious. Kid friendly...especially if you check in for your free cookie!"}
{"text":"So good. I would imagine that every single thing on the menu is good but I had the turkey pot roast dip and it was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Easy for me to order online Block in around the line and simply Grab & Go great sandwiches super fast just doesn't get better than that"}
{"text":"WOW!  I wasn't expecting much... but WOW!  The Mihami Vice (cubano) was AMAZING!  Roasted pork, ham, creamy mustard, Swiss, pickle spears, baguette... sounds pretty gross actually but OMG!  Mouthgasm!  I never say that about a sandwich!  But WOW!!!!  

I was in town for work and my co-worker took me here.  The staff was super nice and the food was hot and fresh.  The guy at the register even came and held the door open!  Talk about service!  The soda machine was fun giving you lots of choices on a touch screen menu... I even got to add cherry to my diet Dr. Pepper.  Pretty cool!

I will ABSOLUTELY visit the next time I am in town!

I wish I could give 10 stars... it's just that good!"}
{"text":"I really, really, really, really enjoyed Even Stevens Sandwiches.  They appear to have done very well on Yelp which is why I opted to try them!  The restaurant is insanely clean.  The tables and booths were clear.  The floors were immaculate and the service was friendly, prompt and made me feel welcome.  The decor is hip, fun and modern.  Their logo consists of an animated / cartoon hand holding up a peace sign.  In addition to their delicious meals, they have t-shirts for sale representin' their name / logo.  It's a fun place I would suggest seeing for yourself.  Enough about the decor, how 'bout those sandwiches?

I was going to try the Ruben because who in the heck doesn't love a good Ruben sandwich?  But everyone sells a Ruben these days.  I mean, you can get a Ruben anywhere.  Heck, even Arby's sells a Ruben so I opted for something unique to Even Stevens - their Mihami Vice a.k.a. The Cubano.  While this sandwich may be prevalent and popular in Miami, FL, it is not so prevalent in Arizona.  Plus, I love pork.  And speaking of pork.  I'm getting ahead of myself here.  I do that when I'm writing an overly excited review on Yelp about food I've just devoured.  So anywho, the sandwich is served on a fresh baked baguette which is chewy, but not too chewy like a good baguette should be.  Wedged inside of the baguette is a large helping of their infamous roasted pork.  Soooo much flavor!  The pork was tender, melt-in-your-mouth and exactly what I needed after a hard Wednesday at the salt mines.  But wait!  There's more!  Lying next to all that roasted pork is you guessed it.  More pork.  This time in the form of some delicious ham which was also equally awesome.  It wasn't dry or tough like ham can sometimes be.  So you've got the roasted pork, the ham, the baguette AND under all of that pork melted to the baguette are several slices of swiss cheese.  Cooling off all that ham on the sandwich are a few dill pickle spears and the condiment is a what they refer to as a 'creamy mustard'.  Quite frankly, I don't care what they call it.  It was a concoction that hit the spot on this late Wednesday afternoon!   Coupled with the sandwich was a heaping pile of potato chips lying next to it.  

Their fountain soda machine is also one of those weird fun ones that have the capability of mixing several thousand different combinations of flavors together.  So if you want grape Coke (I'm being facetious) or whatever... you can have that, too.

My only minor, minor, minor gripe was the simple fact that I did not get a napkin when my food was brought to my table.  There were no napkins on the table and the only pile of them were next to the window where the server collects your food.  So it would appear they would bring the napkin to the table when they bring you your lunch / dinner, but I didn't get one.  AND that's not that big of a deal.  Still no reflection on my meal as a whole and still not a reason why I would not hesitate to recommend Even Stevens to any of my friends, family or fellow Yelpers.  Oh!  You guys!  I totally forgot!  So... also, I 'checked in' here with Yelp when I arrived and I scored this gigantic oatmeal-raisin cookie just for checking in on Yelp!  (no photos of the cookie.  I ate it on the way home.  sorry, not sorry)  Seriously good sandwiches.  Seriously good cookies.  Awesome chill decor and an awesome chill vibe in the whole place.   Go check it out for sure."}
{"text":"Unique concept! I love that this sandwhich shop is community oriented and putting forth efforts to help others. We were greeted by a very enthusiastic guy, that knew the menu inside and out. 
The place is decorated retro modern with almost a homey feel. 
Great selection of sandwhiches, soups, and salads. They also have wine and beer. 
Grilled cheese- The best grilled cheese I have ever had! Fresh crunchy bread with jalapeno cream cheese, garlic jalapenos and loads of cheese. Amazing!! The tomato soup was a robust consistency and full of flavor. Great combo with the sandwhich.
Turkey Pot Roast- crunchy, crusty loaf, full of tender juicy meat. You would never think this was turkey. The au jus sopped up in the bread nicely. 
I ordered Moscato in a can. But it was served nicely in a wine glass. The wine was actually very good for coming out of a can. Crisp, sweet, and light.
Will definitely return. I hope more restaraunts follow suite and give back in this way, and of course provide awesome food!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches with unique choices.  We ordered the Sprang Chicken, the Bahn Belly, and the Pot Roast Dip....all worth ordering again.  Only downside was the dressing on the salad had a little too strong of a taste.  Value is better than many non franchise sandwich shops.  The service was attentive for a casual, order at the counter establishment but I agree with an earlier review that the tip jar on the counter is annoying; how do you know if a tip is warranted when you are only ordering?  I'd definitely go back.  I also love the charitable twist."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and the server Felia was super nice and very helpful!! I will definitely comeback honestly it was the best sandwich and service I had in a long time! Thanks Felia!"}
{"text":"A new place close to home.  Pretty good cubano sandwich with a side salad.  Will repeat."}
{"text":"Good food and I love the mission to support local! I had the BLT Chopped. Neat idea to have the chips on top but I think next time I'll sub turkey or chicken for the pork. Sandwich looked (and I'm told was) amazing...Sprang Chicken.

Beer served, nice TVs & decor. Can't wait to try for breakfast. And sugar cookies!

Ps catering options looked very reasonable."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick sandwich based on Yelp review. Was impressed all around. Clean and modern inside. Staff was nice and had good recommendations. The food is reasonably priced, and more importantly very good! I recommend the ban mi sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopped in early morning and just had time to grab a coffee. The interior is really fun and the staff is excellent. I can't wait to come back and try some breakfast! I want to give them more stars for having almond milk at their beverage bar because I appreciate that they are conscious of people's dietary habits."}
{"text":"I have driven past this place many times the past few months and decided it was time to check it out! The cool, retro, hipster sandwich place is in the heart of Chandler and a fun spot to check out. Be mindful that it can be difficult to find parking here in the evenings or if there is an even happening in downtown Chandler. I ordered the turkey day which was so good! I didn't know a sandwich could taste so yummy. It exceeded my expectations. The bread is flaky and toasted and the meat is very tender.l gave them 4 stars because the cost is a little much for a sandwich and the portions are not very large. However, if you are looking for a tasty, gourmet sandwich I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I go to this even Stevens all of the time for breakfast burritos and they are usually amazing! But last time the white in my eggs were runny (I ordered them scrambled) and this time I found a thick piece of clear plastic in my burrito...... Had to throw away both of those burritos. 

UPDATE: management reached out and said that they gave their staff further training. Also compensated me for the bad experiences. I have eaten there twice and the food has been amazing."}
{"text":"Great food! Great atmosphere! Mac & Cheese and Turkey day were great and hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Wonderful. Tucson folks this is as close as I've found to Baggins. Love the concept. I had the Turkey Day and soup. Yummy   The only thing I would add is some great ice tea."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches with interesting names.  Very fresh ingredients!  I love the atmosphere too.  I also like that they donate to a charity with every purchase!"}
{"text":"We've used this location on a few occasions for catering meetings and have always been delighted with both the service and the food. The team is so helpful and we love the company ethic. We'd mos def recommend Even Stevens."}
{"text":"Awesome food, service and loved talking to everyone during soft opening. Highly recommend this sandwich shop!!!"}
{"text":"We should have realized something was wrong when we walked into the restaurant and couldn't find anyone to take our order. When someone finally came over they yelled at us when we didn't order correctly, it was our first time in so I'm not sure how we were supposed to know the intricacies of they're poorly designed menu. Service was slow and it looked incredibly under staffed. When the food came it was pretty average although my sandwich had almost no avocado and the side salad was swimming in dressing.

We will not be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"I literally come here 4-5 times a week. The breakfast burrito or break sandwich is incredible. Staff is awesome. Place is clean. Most importantly foods incredible."}
{"text":"It does get pretty busy around lunch time - so if you're looking to get in and out pretty fast - be cognizant of that. I got the jackfruit torta and it was awesome! It is hard to find vegan food that is tasty and filling - and this totally hit the mark. I am nut usually a huge fan of BBQ type flavors, but this had just a hint and had other flavors and textures going on. Very well done and satisfying! (BTW they also have the cool new soda machines and the good crunchy ice.)"}
{"text":"This place is so cool looking and the food was awesome. The manager Danny knew it was our first time there and made sure that we enjoyed our food. The service was excellent and the food came out delicious. I would definitely recommend it to anyone in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Breakfast spot on. Cheapest sandwich in downtown and tastes a million times better than any other sandwich shop. Sides are amazing as well. Can't go wrong here! Cleanest place in downtown. Came here with my girl friend and we were thrilled."}
{"text":"I just had their pot roast dip sandwich, mind blown! The jalapenos jelly is amazing, it has a slightly sweet flavor with a tiny kick. Not enough to call it spicy, but enough to know that it's there. The turkey pot roast was MOIST with a wonderful taste, you can taste the slow cooking that went into it, very umami. Lastly, and to me a very important component in a sandwich is the bread, the texture is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside that brought the whole sandwich together. 

If you're looking to try something new and interesting then this is the sandwich for you the flavor profile is exceptional."}
{"text":"Fantastic new sandwich shop in Downtown Gilbert!  I had the best breakfast sandwich evvveerr!  Pay the extra $1 to substitute the pork belly.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had the braised turkey version of French Dip and must say is one of best sandwiches I've ever had!  So good, went back for dinner 

Looking forward to working my way through entire menu when visiting Phoenix and Salt Lake City.  Hope to see some soon in DFW."}
{"text":"Fun! Fresh cool spot with savory sandwiches. The manager was engaging and sincere with how our experience was. I had the \"Do Gouda\" and the onion marmalade was amazing! She had the \"Mahimi Vice\" and she loved it! Definitely will return soon to this location for another fun filled exciting experience.

p.s. They have games on games so if breaking the ice is difficult for you then I encourage you to visit more so than ever."}
{"text":"Trevor was awesome. The food is amazing and atmosphere was awesome. The pretzels and beer cheese sauce are my favorite."}
{"text":"My grand daughters visited this restaurant today. They had a rude encounter with someone named Liz. When they walked into the restaurant and picked up the menus, Liz responded in a surly way...stating, \"That is not our menu. And pointed to another one.\" (rather than greeting them with a friendly hello and handing them a menu). Then when they asked her if they could make their own sandwich, she responded rudely and tersely \"No.\"  this was their first time using the restaurant and we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot in downtown Gilbert! I came with my parents and we all got sandwiches. I got the hummazing, my dad got the pot roast dip, and my mom got the Reuben. We all loved them. The meat on my parents' sandwiches was perfect- not too tough or chewy. Mine was delicious- even without meat. 

The staff was very friendly and helpful. They gave great recommendations and explanations of the menu. 

The only complaint that we have is that when they cleaned off our table there was an extra napkin that we don't think we used (and the staff surely doesn't know if we did) that they just put back on the clean pile on the counter. I know they were probably trying to reduce waste but it's also unsanitary because what if someone had used it or if it had gotten something on it while at the table.... I surely don't want to use used napkins when I come to a restaurant. (So we took off one star for this...)"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast burritos  and sugar cookies with a great ambiance and friendly service. If you check in on Yelp, you get a free cookie!!"}
{"text":"Omg! I had the Mahami, so good. So toasty and gooey cheese with shaved roasted ham...delicious pickles ahhh. I should have gotten an extra to go. The French toast was amazing. I like the toasted style, since I am accustomed to the saturated type. They have a soda dispenser with my favorite cherry coke. I also tried the pink fizzy lemonade...damn good. I recommend anyone with tastebuds to give this place a try. You'll get hooked like me. I can't wait to try the other sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Good music, great decore, even better food. My wife got the turkey and i got the breakfast burrito. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches - objectively I'd say it's probably the best place around in terms of sandwiches. The only issue is the wait. I get it when it is busy, it often is around lunch, but there have been times I've been in there and I'm the only one, I've had to wait 45 min once. Now I always call ahead."}
{"text":"Even Stevens is the coolest establishment around. They've got tasty food, good service, and a great mission of giving back to the community. I love that they don't physically give a sandwich to every one sold, but instead provide their partnering organizations with the money and means to purchase their own ingredients for making food. I've been to the Tempe location a few times and it was my first time coming to this one. Always happy to support the monthly Veg Night Out and enjoy good company.

We were treated to samples of vegan menu items, including the Brussels sprouts with a maple glaze sans bacon (DELICIOUS), red pepper hummus with veggies and vegan pita bread, shishito peppers, jackfruit torta sandwiches (yum), and a deconstructed version of their New Morrisey burrito, which had a fantastic combination of flavors. I also ordered the JP grilled cheese (amazing) and tomato basil bisque (too sweet for my liking). Staff and management were lovely and accommodating to all and the place exuded positive energy. We were also able to enjoy a vegan dessert called the Pookie pie, which is similar to a Whoopie pie. It was delectable, that I know. 

So glad to see Even Stevens doing well while they adhere to their vision and continue to make excellent food. I wish them all the best and encourage people to try them out, there is something for all palates."}
{"text":"I've been anticipating this visit and so I made dinner plans to come here. I'd heard about their first location opening in Gilbert, then downtown Phoenix and now Tempe. I love their concept of partnering with local food banks and agencies to give back to those who deserve it.

Even Stevens is sandwiched (!) between The Halal Guys and the new bike shop and soon Ahipoki Bowl next to that. Parking is plentiful as it wraps in the back towards Dutch Bros. It's got a cool setup with ample seating and several cushions and couches. Their retro 60s decor definitely took us back to our childhood home and it was comforting. Seems like their intention is to create a sense of nostalgia, along with the games, and they succeed. 

There is an employee standing outside the shop greeting people and giving out menus. We made our choices and ordered at the counter. I got the banh mahi sandwich and my brother ordered the half goat hugger salad and half do gouda sandwich.  It took about 10 minutes for our food to arrive and the busser raved about our choices and how excited she gets when she sees the sandwiches. I appreciated how friendly everyone was and the live entertainment who sang for us. I enjoyed my sandwich; it was on the salty side with the soy glaze but the flavors really worked together and I loved the baguette. The kettle chips were crispy and delicious and the pickle was the perfect accompaniment. Everything tasted fresh and not formulaic like other shops. 

I plan on coming back and trying other menu items! I appreciate the variety of vegan and vegetarian choices and how they are clearly marked on the menu. Plus, they seem to be good with substitutions."}
{"text":"Even Stevens is quite delicious. They have awesome customer service and David provides superior quality service. They have a fantastic layout and atompshere. I really enjoyed the staff and the food is homemade!!! Defiantly stop by again."}
{"text":"What's better than a sandwich?  A sandwich with a cause.  This place is awesome, the interior is amazing and it has such a great vibe!  The food, you ask? Awesome.  Every sandwich you buy = a sandwich donated to a local non profit, such as the Phoenix Rescue Mission and Desert Mission Food Bank. Awesome contribution to the thriving DT PHX scene."}
{"text":"I enjoy the customer service and food they have. I was impressed with the food and the decor! The staff was magnificent and very helpful!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are great. The staff was super friendly. The atmosphere is real hipster-y. They have board games and whatnot. Which is nice since the food took awhile even though it wasn't busy. I felt intimidated to walk in at first because it felt like you should already know what you're doing when you walk in. It would be nice if the counter was closer to the front so it didn't make awkward people like me feel nervous. But overall, I loved the food. The manager was friendly."}
{"text":"This place takes too long. It's not $, it's actually pretty pricey. $9 for their cheapest salad"}
{"text":"Went in for a breakfast burrito got a burrito that sounded sooo good and specifically said egg whites only because I'm allergic to yolk they said no problem well I got to work and it was loaded with yolk so of course I couldn't eat it. I called and the manager anele and she was so nice told me to come in and she would replace the burrito I said great thank you so much! Well the one it was replaced with had a dry tortilla old tater tots in it and when I spoke with Andy he really didn't seem to care. Which is a bummer! Maybe next time it'll be better."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, my fave is the myhammie vice. Great service. And they donate a sandwich for everyone they sell."}
{"text":"Cool places with great sandwiches. The best part is they give back to the community. Great business!"}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly at the door, ordering is confusing because you don't know if you order at the table or the counter, ordered a corned beef sandwich- corned beef not a high quality meat here and not much meat on the sandwich.

Restaurant is comfortable and inviting but the food quality has to be better.

2nd chance? Maybe, but I can't recommend the corned beef sandwich."}
{"text":"I got the Jp's grilled cheese and it was awesome! The bread was perfectly toasty and it was full of flavorful, melty, gooey, spicy, cheese. The ambience was funky and hip and they had a guy playing guitar that was basically a one man show. I would definitely recommend this place and will definitely be back. The cookies are legit too"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is super dope, laid back and chill!!!! 
Food is A-Mazing! 
Definitely will be going back.."}
{"text":"Pretty great place to eat. Lots of options for vegetarian/vegan, as well as people on regular diets. Seating at this location can be a little weird depending on how many people are in the dining room, but there seems to be enough space for individuals and/or groups. The food is pretty good and portions are generous for the price."}
{"text":"Ordered take out today for a late lunch after my husband found on Yelp! Tried the caprese sandwich with side salad, queso, and Reuben. It was phenomenal. Can't wait to go back for brunch"}
{"text":"I got a French dip sandwich from here.  It comes with jalapeño jelly which I got on the side in case I didn't like it, but it ended up being amazing!  The bread was the perfect texture and the sandwich had great flavor!  I would definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"So excited we got a hip sandwich shop on this side of town.  Even Stevens has such a cute vibe.  When you go here I highly recommend the pot roast sandwich.  It's so delicious"}
{"text":"Such a great place! The sandwich was amazing and the chips were delish! Definitely a great place to grab lunch. The service was a bit slow, so make sure you have an extra 10ish min."}
{"text":"Even Stevens has an interesting little business model. It's a chain, but yet they partner up with non-profit organizations that are actually all locally-based. So, when I eat a sandwich here, I can pat myself on the back and declare that I'm a good person - despite denying change to the countless beggars that approach me when I'm filling up my gas tank in sketchy areas of Phoenix.

Even Stevens also boasts that they use local ingredients, which I'm pretty sure means that they partner up with San Tan Brewing company - like pretty much every other restaurant in Phoenix that wants some local \"cred.\" They also have a list of suppliers that they use, most of which, are all Utah-based companies. Not that there's anything wrong with that. They actually have quite an interesting backstory after I did a little research.

We've been here a couple of times and tried a few of their sandwiches. I like their JP Grilled Cheese sandwich, which includes garlic roasted jalapenos that's actually more like some kind of spread/jelly. The sandwich is decent and slightly better than what you'd find at most comparable places that serve grilled cheese. Additionally, I've tried the Do Gouda, which is also fine if you're into the whole New York steak style.

As for the Sprang Chicken: It should be noted that they either forgot to add the avocado, or the avocado is similar to the jalapenos in the sense that it's actually a pureed-spread that they use. I'm not entirely sure. My girlfriend has also the pot roast dip, which she felt was too soggy for what it was trying to pull off.

Yes, you'll get a free cookie upon Yelp check-in. Their freshness might vary, but it's free, so you can't really complain too much.

Ultimately, this is a cool little place that is a step above what you'd find at all of these damned sandwich delis that are identical in terms of what they're doing. For that, I do give them some credit. I'm sure that at some point, we'll eventually return to sample some of their other menu offerings.

Check them out."}
{"text":"We ordered the \"all you can eat\" French toast.  They seemed to be stingy about bringing more out when we asked ... they would bring one very small piece at a time a we'd wait very long for the next small piece."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sandwiches !!! I love their great cause too. Try out the caprese.... want more protein? Add grilled chicken to it."}
{"text":"Went in and no one was at the front to take orders. I stood there for 4 minutes before I left - never acknowledged by any staff. 

If you're selling $10 sandwiches, the least you could do is provide some customer service."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from Even Stevens after hearing rave reviews, but I was really disappointed. 

I had the 'turkey day' on gluten free bread and nothing about it was very good. The bread was soggy and fell apart, leaving me to eat the turkey/cheese with a fork. This may be in part to the bread being gluten free, however other sandwich shops offer gfree bread that doesn't become soggy or fall apart. The turkey was chewy and the cheese was really rubbery, leaving me to eat just a few bites total before throwing it away.

I'm giving it two stars because my fiancé, who ordered the breakfast burrito, finished his and said it was okay, but nothing spectacular. 

For the price and based on this experience, I would not go back."}
{"text":"Whaa! What happened here?! So looking forward to brunch. Huge fail! Cool that they have unlimited french toast for $4.25. It arrived luke warm. Service was slow and food arrived in segments. French toast reload then took quite a bit of time. Kids said french toast was ok. My burrito was a fail. Cold sliced cheese and mounds of raw spinach with alot of siracha sauce made it SO disappointing. No liquor license yet. Staff did ask if I was unhappy with my burrito and if I would like something else. I declined. She discussed it with manager but he was watching NFL and did nothing."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place was empty for Sunday brunch. They had unlimited French toast, amazing $3 mimosas and love music. We had the turkey day and it was spicy and sweet super tasty. Would highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"It's a hipster place with a cause. Went for lunch because of the 4.5 stars. Ordered the a ban mai. It was awful. Greece on top of Greece. Bread is the most important part and it was a swing and a miss! 

The salad was good and the reason it's a 2 instead of 1 star. Atmosphere is hipster. Food is ok  much better places in the area for lunch."}
{"text":"This place has some legit sandwiches, and its super cool that they donate a sandwich for everyone bought. It's a werid environment, but it's cool anyways."}
{"text":"The Mihami Vice, a Cuban style sandwich, is amazing. It's an interesting take on a traditional Cuban. The traditional fillings are served hoagie-style (loose, not pressed) and it totally works. The bread is toasty with hints of butter. This one is my favorite."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are average. Nothing really stands out. I ordered the Sprang Chicken and chips. The chips were incredibly greasy with minimal flavor. The bread was pretty dry so it made it hard to bite down. The lettuce and tomato were fresh, which I liked."}
{"text":"Even Stevens sandwiches are delicious! Awesome food and they donate one Great atmosphere, fantastic sandwiches full of flavor. The meats are all incredibly tender and the sauces are succulent and unique. When you walk in you'll notice the staff are smiling and full of life. Very happy with this place! Wish there was one in SoCal! This particular location has a fitting farm theme that matched this history of the surrounding area. One of the coolest things about this restaurants is that they donate one sandwich to a charity for every sandwich that is sold. You can see the amount of sandwiches sold on the wall for this store as well as nationally across all of their stores. Giving back is great, but giving back while eating a delicious sandwich is much more rewarding. This branch has been open a few months and donated over 6000 sandwiches to charity. Nationally they have donate almost a million in 2 years."}

{"text":"Seems like more help was needed behind the counter today. It took about 10 minutes to place my order and then nearly 20 minutes to receive a breakfast sandwich. The sandwich, with bacon, was good. The maple glaze adds a nice touch. The tater tots were horrible. They were greasy and clearly sitting around too long as they were barely luke warm. I'd try them once more but another crazy wait with non-hot food and I won't return (Ike's never lets me down)."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast joint. The food was delicious and inexpensive. The place was clean and well decorated! Staff was awesome."}
{"text":"Our first time trying Even Stevens was yesterday and we loved it! The best part about it was the customer service we received from Rythm the gentleman that took our order! Truly one of a kind. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying this place and I was upset I hadn't gone sooner.  The sloppy joe (and side salad) was awesome and I got to enjoy it in their cool interior.  Prices are reasonable and the staff stays busy and friendly throughout your visit.  Definitely give this place a shot sometime if you're looking for lunch near campus!"}
{"text":"The hardest thing in the food business is getting customers to first try. 1) I think the name is dumb... even though I use that term all the time. 2) the corporate photos on yelp don't really show your quality. 
I went for a breakfast sandwhich. 
Walked in. Staff friendly and smiling and helped answer my questions. 
Found out they serve Peixoto Coffee. 
Great sandwhich. I mean *****
Try it. I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"This place took me and my Fiancé from 2000 the 70s it was super Retro, I remember seeing a few of the furniture pieces in my family home. lol I was so nice and had a good feeling.  
Now onto the food I had the Sprang Chicken sandwich Roasted chicken, provolone, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, cucumbers, greens, honey mustard, multi-grain it was delish and my fiancé had the Cubano with the taters he was really please with the Cubano. We shared the taters which were OK.. a little under cooked and could of done without all the dressings maybe we should of asked for those on the side, But over all a Nice place and good Food, We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Wow I loved it, everything was five stars about this place! The pot roast sandwich with jalapeño jelly is insanely good. Everything else great too. Can't beat the ice cold coors in bottle for $1 either. The party tots a nice warm up to delicious sandwiches. I will definitely be back to this cool spot."}
{"text":"Lots of options. I got the jalapeño Mac and cheese with an upgrade to the tots in the side. 

Since I mentioned yelp I got a free huge cookie as well. 

He tots came with three dips. The Russian dressing one was the Best for me. 

The Mac and cheese was excellent (a little warm) but really tasty. 

Very inexpensive.  Recommended."}
{"text":"I'm currently eating here for probably the second dozen time. The sandwiches and salads are wonderful as well as their beer and mimosas! Within their menu they have helpful icons to identify both vegetarian and vegan options. 

Bringing back a wonderful retro vibe the restaurant is a hot hangout spot, welcoming guests to enjoy themselves for as long as they would like! Not to mention complimentary coffee for students, and tons of time passers kept in restaurant such as rock-em-sock-em robots, along with a couple 3D View-Masters including dozens of playful slides to view. 

On top of their wonderful food, atmosphere, and well rounded as well as speedy service, the restaurant has a Cause! Donating a sandwich to one of their 4 partner causes for every sandwich or wrap built just goes to show how for the people they are! 

All in all it's a great hangout spot, quick bite, and nostalgia triggering blast from the past everyone needs! Not to mention $3 mimosas and unlimited French toast for the price of one on Sundays!"}
{"text":"I was excited for this to open but very disappointing in my 1 experience. The menu is confusing. And my Togo order was wrong.  It really disappointed me because I didn't check the bag (even though my name was correct on it and the name of the sand which I ordered was correct) and when I got to my office, it was a completely different sandwhich. 

To make matters worse, this sandwich wasn't very tasty and also cheaper than the one I paid for. 

I would stay away and go to Jersey Mike's instead."}
{"text":"These Sammies are superb. Might could be the best turkey sandwich I've had. Open air environment with couches and tons of seating. 5 strong stars."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix for a couple of days, and Even Stevens was right around the corner from my hotel. It was the perfect lunch spot. The vegan sandwich was wonderful. I came back the next day to get a salad for dinner, which was also delicious. It doesn't seem like a late night spot, so I was surprised they were open so late. The service was quick and friendly. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. The party tots are definitely a party waiting to happen.   The stuffed French toast is served all day. I would highly recommend the chicken spring sandwich too.  They have an additional location in Gilbert where we have been before."}
{"text":"It is really cool that you are giving back when you eat here. They partner with non-profit organizations to donate a sandwich for every sandwich that is purchased. We came here for a family night dinner and it was very good! I got the Do Gouda and really liked it! The onion relish was very strong though. The other sandwiches my family got all looked great. We also tried the party tots and beer cheese pretzels. The beer cheese is very strong and the toys were not our favorite but they were cool to try. Just wouldn't get them again. For the purpose this serves it is great and for he sandwiches are pretty awesome if you are looking for a specialty sandwich."}
{"text":"Awesome place downtown Phoenix, food, atmosphere, beer selection and price were all great. The gal playing guitar and singing was terrific."}
{"text":"The grilled cheese is amazing and spicy! The ranch is tasty! The tator tots could have been a little less dry but other than that it was amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot to stop in for a quick bite or a casual sit down meal with friends. Great for breakfast and lunch. Great for ASU students who are looking for some good food in between classes too. Came here after a morning class and had a delicious breakfast burrito. Decent prices and good specials. You definitely should give them a try. Great hang out spot or just for studying as they have several comfortable lounge areas as well!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich in town, and the side salad. Top notch lunch. Highly recommended, good vibes"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I have ever had! Love, love, love the ambience here! Unique and eclectic decor and I absolutely love their music! 

Staff is very friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Love finding little restaurants with big goals! We stopped into Even Stephens Sandwich Shop and normally we would pass it by but a sweet lady stopped us and told us when you buy one meal they donate one. Now that's something we can get behind! Thank you sweet lady for explaining your mission & for reaching out! So many people could learn from this lady.. Building your business is first about building relationships. And side note my salad was sooooo Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"So impressed was I on my first visit to an Even Stevens last night- Tempe location- that I wanted to try the new Scottsdale branch (a little over a month old), and I decided to stop by before seeing Wonder Woman on the \"silver screen.\"  (This particular film occupies a HUGE moment in film history, as it broke box office records for female director; holds the highest grossing opening weekend ever; and we audiences had to wait through NINE Batman and TEN Superman movies before seeing this beloved comic and TV classic come to fruition!!  We are women, hear us ROAR!)

Service was OK.  Not as impressive, or as familiar with the menu (both cashier/runner and a cook) as the service encountered in Tempe, but this location's only a month old...  There's time to improve.  :)  As with yesterday's visit, I offered three food items: two new-- Reuben sandwich, with Kettle-brand chips and Shishito peppers (my first experience with!)- and my already-beloved Stuffed French toast.  Everything was OMGoodness delicious.  I haven't encountered a bad choice, yet.  However, I've yet to try the cookies I've received for free with Yelp check-in.  Of course, these cookies are from Rise Up Bakery in Gilbert, so I know they're going to be very good."}

My love for the Stuffed French toast and the sandwiches here- I've tried the Pot roast dip and Reuben in two other locations- brought me to try this Gilbert location.  Inviting live music (female vocals with acoustic guitar) wafted through the open windows and door as I walked in.  It's a bit chilly in here, but I always have a sweater in the car for times like this.  Noticed I didn't have to wear it for long, so someone must've taken notice and turned A/C down-- thank you!

I tried the JP Grilled cheese, with salad, Brava tots, and my beloved Stuffed French toast.  I enjoyed the albeit over-salted grilled cheese, made with garlic-roasted jalapeños, white cheddar, and cream cheese on satisfyingly-toasty French bread until I reached a corner of the half-sandwich and tasted something more akin to detergent/cleaner. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/even-stevens-sandwiches-gilbert?select=iOsmVJoPipnQj_w2RHmhxg  To cleanse my tongue, I switched to the brava tots, which tasted great with their paprika dusting and garlic aioli, but I would order this again with the aioli on the side so that I may control how much I consume.  Went back to the sandwich and again tasted something akin to glass cleaner.  Took the second-half home to see if it too was handled with a contaminated glove- I will update soon.

All of the food comes out around the same time, including the French toast, since it is an entree you may order anytime of day here (within business hours, of course), and I was already disappointed from the presentation alone. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/even-stevens-sandwiches-gilbert?select=Kh7KZoz0Q6yIgoWEC56Bpw  Besides the actual uninspired plating, the bread looked shrunken, and after the first bite, I felt like either this had been sitting for a long time prior, or perhaps the bread used was more than a day old...  Also, there wasn't much of the sweet cream cheese stuffed in between the old, shrunken bread.  Gilbert's version made me want to weep, as I knew how great it could've been!

I'm hoping that my sub-par experience here in Gilbert was due to shabby kitchen staff skills and not to my too-frequent visits to a chain.  I do admire Even Stevens' dedication to helping out local communities- this location's partners are Open Arms Care Center, United Food Bank, Boys & Girls Clubs of the East Valley, and A New Leaf- but I think I'll just visit the Tempe and Scottsdale locations from now on.  [I need to see if my hypothesis on Tempe and Scottsdale having the better kitchen staff skills after all. ;)]"}
{"text":"Have a craving for stuffed French toast any time of day?  I do!  I do!

First visit, and I was a little worried after reading a few of trusted Yelp friends' reviews, but I am very impressed!  Admittedly, I stepped up to an empty line, so I had Morgan's full attention, but the customer service was terrific, with her showing extensive knowledge of the menu and willingness to check with kitchen staff regarding allergy concerns.  (Perhaps having a relative with a sunflower oil allergy made her empathetic to my issues?) The friendly service, offered with a lot of smiles, continued throughout my stay here.  But what about the food, you ask??  Everything I tried was scrumptious, and the flavors, textures, and COLORS were ALMOST on point-- I found the jalapeño pepper jelly in the pot roast sandwich to be a bit too sweet, but overall, the sandwich was delicious, and I'd order it again. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nKRXBeqZ_pZn05ZR78MaYQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  Special mention-- that Stuffed French toast is, as Peixoto owner Julia once told me (and then repeated on a comment on my Instagram post) \"a game changer!\" https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=XjZ1kJOyNAD1Pf7-9sBAFw&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  Come here, try it, and you'll see.

I'm already looking forward to my second visit!

Two minor complaints- the tots in the re-fire weren't fully cooked and the Peixoto drip coffee in the second thermos- the first was completely empty- was a tad above lukewarm.  The first Party Tots served was perfect (delectable textures and popping flavors), but the salsa fresca had cucumbers in it (allergy), and Morgan immediately offered a remake. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=M8A_dzhLjs9zDLubTYVdSg&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  I commend the effort in the eagerness in correcting, though, and I'm sure the cook, as well as manager Liz, both wanted to get the app out asap since I was already served my Pot Roast Dip sandwich (lovely!) and Stuffed French toast (fabulous!).  

(Ahem!) Coffee should not be served cooler than body temperature...

Breads and stand-alone cookies served here are from Rise Up Bakery, so that's another plus!  Love to support restaurants that partner up with local shops!

Did you know that Even Stevens locations match their monthly profits \"even stevens\" and donate across multiple Cisco accounts so that funds may be used appropriately to feed the hungry?  This Tempe shop is at 27,536 sandwiches donated and counting.  Not bad when it just opened back in January of this year!

Thank you to Morgan and Izzy for the service and info.  I'll be back very soon!

p.s.  A new location, near Scottsdale Fashion Square, just opened two weeks ago, so I'll be visiting that one soon, too!"}
{"text":"Super laid back cafe which I loved because my   mini clones were able to hang out leisurely while we waited for our food and ate.

Tons of boards games to play. Arcade game when you walk in.

Breakfast is served all day. The boyfriend got the breakfast burrito with pork belly, super filling and yummy. The salsa was super fresh and yummy. Kids got kids meals which came with a side and a drink. Would have like to seen more nondairy options on the menu but still had a couple of choices. Had a couple other menu items that were also yummy. Everything was really fresh. Pricing is very reasonable. 

If you check in with yelp you can get a free cookie. I got a non dairy chocolate creme pookie pie. For serious this pookie pie was absolutely amazing. I have since researched the business that makes them (city cakes). I didn't realize it was non dairy until half way through when the lactose free child wanted a bite of my delicous goodness. 

There is a parking garage literally next door and tons of metered parking around the block.

You can get unlimited french toast for $4 on Sundays. Oh and $3 mimosas. You can also get some cheap local brewery beers too. San tan brewery as an example.

Defitinely will be back!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute little place to hang out.  The woman who took our order was extremely nice and helpful. I got a Grad breakfast burrito and it was absolutely delicious. Just the perfect size where I didn't feel too full after I was finished eating.  The rest of the menu also looked wonderful and I will definitely be back to try some other things! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Even Stevens... And it definitely will not be my last.
I love the laid-back atmosphere with a mix of tables and couches. The decor is edgy and simple but very cool. Huge bonus points for the fact that they serve one of my favorite local coffees from Peixoto in Chandler...and the music played over the speakers is great. 
They have a program that gives back to the community through local nonprofit partners... for every sandwich you buy they donate one to those in need. 

And THEN there's the food!

I had the Mihami Vice (Cubano)...wow!!!
Roasted pork, ham, creamy mustard, Swiss, pickle spears, on a baguette that holds up well with the juices from the meat! The baguette is soft but not too soft... And a little bit crunchy but not too crunchy. Is that possible?? 
Time and time again a great sandwich is ruined by horrible bread... Not this time!

I cannot wait to come back and try more items on the menu... I really want to dig into the brioche French toast.
Thanks Even Stevens! Happy to have found you. I guarantee I will help spread the word about this gem."}
{"text":"I love Even Stevens and what they stand for. The restaurant is always clean and food delicious. They donate a sandwich to the hungry for every one you buy. Food is fresh. They serve beer. The music in the dining area is usually 80's music that doesn't kill your ear drums. I'll keep going back as long as they have a sandwich I haven't tried. One bad thing, if you are on the cusp of becoming a diabetic, DO NOT order the sugar cookie. You will face a lifetime of insulin. Otherwise, try it, I can't imagine not liking the sandwiches."}
{"text":"We have been to the location multiple times and it just gets better every time! Great staff, great food, great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great place, I had the Pot Roast Dip sandwich, it was awesome, a hint of spice with jalapeño jelly.  It can with a side salad, next time I'll get dressing on the side, way to much on the salad, but otherwise it was an awesome meal!  Service was super friendly, I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent sandwich joint.  Despite the effort to stand out from other sandwich chains, I really did not find a huge difference except for their mission and some healthier options. I am a bleeding heart and applaud the business models inclusion of contributions to non-profit organizations. With that said, the food itself is ok.  I would however choose Even Stevens over other chains which I would mostly rate sub-par.  East Coast shout out to all the great sandwich deli's, you have spoiled me and made it difficult for me to be objective.  Unfortunately the closest Even Stevens to my location is  still a bit far for anything other than a very infrequent visit.  I would not go out of my way to eat here yet would definitely stop in while shopping in the Arrowhead area."}
{"text":"Super tasty sandwiches! However I've felt uncomfortable around the staff several times. Twice I've gone in there and they have yelled across the restaurant to coworkers. Another time my husband and I were approached mid conversation by who I'm assuming was the manager?? Not sure. And she explained who they donate to and more about the business. It was nice but the conversation went on for an awkward amount of time and I'm not sure who she was (she was eating at a table near us). Strange. But again, I enjoy this place because their food is delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is a really good sandwich spot! I have been here several times and I have some tips for potential customers. 1. The tater tots are horrible. I ordered online for pick-up and the tots tasted old and hard. I called the manager and he was so AWESOME! He apologized and made me a whole new order. Sadly, they were hot this time, but still tasted the same. I'm not sure how they cook the tots, but they might want to cook or buy a different brand of tots because I'm telling you, they are the worst tots I have ever had. 2. Don't order online. I ordered online and my tots and mac n cheese were very cold when I picked it up. I was 10 minutes early from the time they quoted my food to be ready and the food was already bagged.  I have been here where I have ordered to go in person and the freshness of the food is night and day. 3. Do get the Turkey Day! It's my favorite sandwich so far."}
{"text":"Trendy/relaxed aesthetic. Friendly staff that greet you with recommendations. Was in a sandwich mood but went with the breakfast burrito. Generous portions worth the buck and tastes as good as it looked. Probably will be back for lunch"}
{"text":"Got a beet salad and should have asked about the dressing, it was all cream based and i could not eat it. Mac and cheese was a hit at the table. The bread served with the salad was tasty. Soda machine was also a hit. Seeing the 1980's toys were really cool."}
{"text":"Very cool and hipster atmosphere. Parking is next door in a garage and they do not validate so take note. We ordered the party tots to start, they lacked salt and really any flavor. My fiance ordered the Miami Vice (cubano), which really needed a sauce to add a bit of something but the meat was tasty. I ordered the sloppy joe and it had a really great flavor but came out cold. The food is high quality but there were definitely seasoning issues for us. I would give this place another try, their breakfast menu looks very interesting. Not the best first impression though"}
{"text":"Great, fun place- great for kids.  Games while you wait, and the food is amazing! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So, I've been hearing a lot about this placed called Even Steven's that had opened recently in downtown. So I thought I'd give it a try after taking a look at their menu. Clever and funny it is at the same time. So after finding a parking space, I make my way to the sandwich shop.

My first impression of the joint was to immediately turn around and walk out. The place oozed millennial / hipster / Scottsdale-Bro mentality, pretty much everything I despise about the people running around off their meds in today's world... But then again, I am posting this with a smartphone, so yes I see the irony... 

Moving on... I make my way to the counter and was greeted promptly. Plus. I told the hostess that I'd like to place a carryout order for two Do Gouda sandwiches, one without the red onions with the marmalade on the side. No potato salad? Fail. So plain photo chips that I'm pretty sure were Lays was what we got.

Fast forward nearly twenty minutes, my take out order is ready. Twenty min for two sandwiches when I'm the only one in the store? Did you have to go out back and round up the cow, and smoke the gouda while I waited really? Fail. Both orders went into two separate bags... okay whatever.

Meet up with the other person who wanted the sandwich, the one who wanted hers without the red onions and the marmalade on the side, well, sure enough, onions were on the sandwich as was the marmalade after the bag was clearly written on saying otherwise. Fail. And these people want $15 an hour, really???

Okay fine, whatever, I'm hungry and I dig into my sandwich. Now, I will say, these guys do make a mean roast beef and gouda. Damn good really. Plus. Aside from the boring Lays photo chips, the sandwich was absolutely awesome.

The greatness of the food greatly offsets the millennial / hipster dirty feeling one gets from walking into this place I will say that. I'm not sure I will return to the downtown location for this reason, and well, parking is a hassle, but I will have to go check out one of their other valley locations."}
{"text":"I love their undergrad breakfast burrito! Food is amazing and friendly staff! It's good to know every sandwich sold goes to a good cause!"}
{"text":"The Bahn Mi sandwich was delicious! However, the Da Gouda had beef that was too fatty."}
{"text":"Great concept. Buy a sandwich, give a sandwich. You get a free cookie with check in too so this went from 3 stars to 4. My husband ordered a basic sandwich (meat, cheese, bread). It came with scraped off avocado which made it inedible (for him). Be better than that ESS, philanthropy without integrity is just nothing at all. Don't make us be jerks asking for what we requested & paid for at the beginning. Next time I'm in AZ I'll give you another shot, hopefully we can get this up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"The young man that helped us, Taylor, was extremely helpful. He came to our table a couple times to check on us. He was very friendly and really looked liked he enjoyed his job and being there. A couple tv's kept us entertained while eating. Wish this place was in Southern California, then I could go all the time. Thanks for the great food and service."}
{"text":"I'd give this place five stars if it wasn't for the pompousity of their business plan. 

If you're going to do charity, don't brag about it. 

The fact that they say a sandwich for a sandwich is misleading, as well. They give boxes of produce sold wholesale to charities to make sandwiches, so the amount they're donating is not much. 

But, again, I can't stand places that have to pat themselves on the back. 

Their concept and gimmick really irks me and I'm not going back, even though the food is very good."}
{"text":"Even Stevens, the socially conscious sandwich! This ain't no broodwich. You can almost taste the morality in each bite. For every sandwich that is sold, the shop donates an equal amount of sandwich materials to various nonprofits in Arizona. There was a fairly steady line when we got here around lunchtime but it moved pretty fast and we got our orders quickly.

I had the hummanizing sandwich with the side salad. The sandwich had lightly toasty bread, hummus, and vegetables. It was supposed to be on wheat bread but it looked like they used the same French bread that my friend had on her turkey day sandwich. The flavors worked well together. The side salad had fresh mixed greens, grape tomatoes and a lightly sweet vinaigrette.

Overall it was a decent sandwich and we were done just in time to get back from our hour lunch. There are better sandwich places in this area but for the price and quick service Even Stevens is a good choice."}
{"text":"I was feeling like a cheapskate and wanted a bite to eat before getting some lovely Peixoto Coffee a few doors down. We walked around a bit through the downtown Chandler area but everything seemed too pricey for my tastes today, or was super busy with no seating available. Since Even Stevens was so close to Peixoto we decided to eat here for lunch. The menu is basically the same as other locations, with sandwiches, salads, sides, and breakfast options. 

The restaurant occupies a cushy corner spot with a nice open layout and large windows to let a lot of light through. There are a multitude of seating options too, with high tables, booths, and regular tables, as well as a front patio. 

I felt like having something a little lighter today so I had the New Morrissey, a vegan breakfast burrito with veggies, tots, tofu, and soyrizo with a side of salsa. It was made in a few short minutes and was a hefty burrito. The tortilla was lightly toasted which made a great contrast to the other textures in the burrito. The creaminess of the tofu worked well as an egg substitute while the roasted veggies and tater tots were lightly crunchy. The whole thing was a pop of flavor in every bite, and was an interesting mix of Southwestern spices from the soyrizo and pureed salsa and the fresh flavors of the veggies. Since the first ingredient listed in the Morrissey burrito is soyrizo I was hoping to see more of it than a smallish smear off to the side. I think the main component in the whole thing was actually the tater tots. Maybe it's for the best though because the actual soyrizo pieces were a bit tough. 

I also had a bite of the Rueben which was excellent. The corned beef packed in a lot of flavor and all the components of the sandwich worked well together. 

Overall Even Stevens is a great place for a reasonably priced quick meal if you're in downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"2 sandwiches, 2 drinks and some tater tots.$26.
That would have been fine if we had gotten what we paid for... having never been there we say and waited for our cups... And waited... Tried to all, but was ignored. Tossed brought and we asked for our drinks.. Cups were handed to us. Tots were nothing spectacular at all.. Much better next door at Smash burger. Sandwiched come and the boyfriends pot roast sandwich green all over, he asked for no Jalepeno. 3 bites later he throws it down disgusted, covered in Jalepeno jelly ... I again attempt to get someone to remake the sandwich to no avail. 
Mine was ordered on gluten free bread. Unfortunately I also can not confirm is Gluten-free. I pack the sandwich to go.. He's pissed and is now ready to go. 
I called to clarify if the bread is Gluten-free.. She said \"if you ordered it Gluten-free then it's Gluten-free \" I explained that  my boyfriend ordered no Jalepeno and his is covered in Jalepeno jelly. She said it should be gluten free. Great.. I have to trust that response or get sick!?!?? WTF?? (She never acknowledged the other sandwich that was messed up.. 
That sandwich hot the garbage also! $26 wasted... Well as others pointed out, I guess they feed 2 people when we bought our sandwiches... Too bad we didn't get a meal out of it...
Customer Service had a few chances and failed miserably..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love it so much! 

Atmosphere: fresh, hip, casual, easy going 

Food: friendly for all types of diets

Staff: helpful, pleasant, and quick!

I came in here on a Saturday after going to the market in Gilbert with my mom & son. We skimmed the huge menu boards but if you really wanna know the food descriptions there are menus next to the counter to read! We chose the Hummazing and the New Morrisey and of course Brava Tots (sauce on the side!) We try and eat a mostly vegan diet so it is refreshing to not have to change ANYTHING on a menu item for once. I always love that. 

So I can't describe how delicious everything was. My mom's hummus sandwich was so good. Fresh veggies and yummy sauce ughhh I could eat that every day. My breakfast wrap was amazing as well. Loaded with tots, soyrizo, tofu and veggies! YUM. A side of tots is also a must. (The brava sauce is not vegan. We got it on the side tho!) YUM A MILLION TIMES YUM! 

I've been back here twice since then. Equally great experiences each time!

I love the giving back to the community part and the support they give local businesses. Really an amazing place I can't wait to bring my friends/family to when they visit."}
{"text":"This is a new sandwich shop in the Arrowhead area. We ordered the turkey sandwich, grilled cheese and an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. The food was super tasty and the Wallace & Ladmo theme brought me back to my childhood. I'd recommend this place for anytime of day eats."}
{"text":"Who doesn't want to give back while eating a good ass sandwich?! The mission of ESS is \"Eat  give\" they partner with local companies and give back to them each month, in return they volunteer and give back to those in need. 
The plus to this is the food is pretty good! I got the grilled cheese and let's just say it's a close second to my homemade grilled cheese. I love that they put cream cheese inside and offer chips or a salad for sides (I got the salad).
I also love how they didn't forget about the littles! They have games, coloring books and little toys to keep them occupied. 
The only downfall is they don't have a kids menu, and a changing station in the women's restroom but not the men's."}
{"text":"How can I keep forgetting to finish this review I started months ago. Lol 

Oh Even Stevens.  How I love you.  Seriously.  I heard about this little gem from some fellow co workers.  The smell of their lunch, specifically the b.sprouts, had me intrigued. They gave me a taste of one of their sprouts and I was mind blown.  Granted, I love me some sprouts.  

The fam and I decided to try ES out after we got done with mighty mud mania this year.  We were 
not disappointed at all.  

Party tots - Amazeballs (and the husband hates...yes hates guac. but he loved these tots).  

Brussel sprouts - bacon and sprouts. You can't go wrong there!!

C loves the Mac and cheese.

My favorite sandwich, the Bhan Mi. Ask for a side of gari (thin sliced pickled ginger). They use a little of it in their pickled slaw, but adding extra just bring this sandwich to a higher level of awesomeness.  

Don't forget the Yelp check-in! (Free cookie!)"}
{"text":"We came here tonight for Valentines day dinner, you're right, ES doesn't scream 'romantic' but, we have a newborn and a toddler. We wanted soup and a warm sub and immediately knew what we were going to order our minds were set on items we have previously had no need to fix what's not broken, amiright?? 
We place our order, we grab our drinks out of the really cool Coca Cola machine, we sit down we start playing with the boardgames and they alert us they are all out of ham- and both of our meals main ingredient is ham. Yes, they refunded us after the confusion but this is consecutively the second time we have drove here and they are out of something. 
I want to love this restaurant because there is a lot to love but it's annoying and frustrating when they are fresh out of ingredients, the customer service from the beginning was questionable and she seemed tired or regretful working the rainy holiday but towards the end the supervisor refunding us for our meal apologized and handled it amazing.
My husband rants and raves about the downtown Phoenix location however, this is 15 minutes closer to home.
Maybe I'll give them a 3rd chance- or maybe I'll arrive for lunch hours instead of dinner service. 
Either way, I'm looking for a sandwich HOTSPOT!"}
{"text":"We have been here three times in a week. ITS SO GOOD. The dip and the Caprese are my favorites so far. It's big and open and the staff is super friendly. Glad this is in Gilbert! And a bonus? The donate to the community!"}

{"text":"Everything I have tried here is delicious and the employees are always very upbeat and inviting! I recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious sandwich. They also have THE BEST frosted sugar cookies!"}
{"text":"Great location and nice, relaxed atmosphere in downtown Gilbert. Staff very friendly, and they have a great cause. They donate a sandwich for every one you order. My son and I went for brunch. He ordered the Sprung chicken with chips, which he enjoyed very much and said it was delicious. His food looked fresh and the Sandwich was big! 
I ordered the stuffed French toast, which wasn't so great. The taste was good-- loved the berry compote, cream cheese and banana filling, but the bread was very hard and stale--like they made the French toast ahead of time and just reheated it on the plate. It was so dry! Not enjoyable at all. I sent it back and asked them to please remake it fresh. The second plate was exactly the same! I was very disappointed and notified the waitress. She offered to give me a refund, but I declined because I know part of their business is to donate for a good cause. I think they should either take it off the menu, or start making it fresh to order---not reheated"}
{"text":"First time here. They only opened a little over a week ago. Food selection was good. We both liked our sandwiches. Staff working hard and manager very engaged in customer  service. Also for each sandwich puchased they donste one to local charity. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot! Chef inspired menu and a fun atmosphere to enjoy your food. Lots of vegan and vegetarian options. The Jackfruit Torta is my favorite sandwich."}
{"text":"I love this place because the food is awesome and they give back to the the community.
They have live music every now and then and it definitely has a cool vibe.
I've only had the pot roast sandwich with a kick, they add jalapeño jelly. Just the right heat. You can tell the people that work there love their job and they are super friendly. Finally a restaurant that's cool on the west side."}
{"text":"Very distinct, nice, clean little spot. Most of their sandwiches are unique with a choice of chips or a side salad and you can combine them with a diff beer. The side salad is actually pretty good! I will def be going back to try their different items on the menu. Overall, it's a very chill, hang out place with board games!!- always a plus on my book!"}
{"text":"No Iced Tea??!!  Gotta have the basics. \"Do Gouda\" lacks the beef. The jackfruit torta sandwich is different but a little on the salty side and messy.  My tots were luke warm almost cold. Not sure I'd rush back here especially for the prices of sandwiches and average food!"}
{"text":"Even Stevens is a good place to grab a quick bite without breaking the bank in Downtown Phoenix. I've tried the corned beef sandwich, New Morissey burrito (vegan), Jackfruit torta, and stuffed French toast. All were delicious and very filling. 

The service was great. Friendly employees and prompt service."}
{"text":"While the sandwiches are OK in this place, the service is atrocious. On a recent visit it took over 30 minutes to receive my order. It was for a vegetarian sandwich-no substitutions and no complications. And this wasn't the first time that the wait was unacceptably long.

The problem doesn't seem to be isolated to the kitchen as the check out line takes too long as well.

It's not like this is some small family run sandwich shop in a strip mall not expecting the volume. It's a chain fast casual restaurant in a high traffic downtown location. They should be prepared for the \"lunch rush\"."}
{"text":"My husband would rate the Mihami Vice TEN stars if he could. I never hear him rave about a sandwich, but he's obsessed! The French toast is good, a little in the dry side, but not bad. The new morrissey burrito is tasty! I wish the roasted veggies weren't 90% onion and even more so, I wish that the mixed veggies weren't pre-mixed so that I could request no onions (as onions can cause migraines for me.) The vibe of the place is chill and relaxing. We love that the sandwiches help support local causes."}
{"text":"I support this cause 100%, And feel great knowing that my previous 3 meals here have led to 3 meals for others.

Having said that, I am not going back to the Tempe location again.

The downtown PHX location is always tasty, accommodating, friendly.

What Happened Today in Tempe:

I walked in, approached the cash register. 

My plan was to order my usual. A side of bacon, regular French toast, and scrambled eggs.

A gentleman in a Grey baseball cap and t shirt asked for my order...

Me: \"yes, can I get a side of bacon....\"

Employee (immediately interrupting): \"uh...OK JUST a side of bacon?\" (He looks down to enter the order).

Me: \"No, there's more. Can I also get just regular French toast?\"

Employee: \"Oh so like, not with the berries?\"

Me: \"Correct. A regular order of French toast. Am I able to get that?\"

(Context: Even Stevens serves regular French toast on Sundays. Every other day, they usually serve French toast with berries and berry compote. However, the past 3 visits I asked for regular, and they kindly accommodated.)

The employee's facial expression looked like he was genuinely confused, or being willfully obtuse to make a point that I was being a difficult customer.

His next line really spelled things out for me.

Employee: \"So like......(long pause, hands reaching out in confusion) just plain French toast? Like you don't even want cinnamon and sugar on it?\"

Me: \"Actually... let's cancel the whole order please. Thank you.\"

Employee: \"Uh...ok so you don't want the bacon?\"

Me: \"No, I don't want anything. I'm gonna head out, thanks.\"

Employee (again, feigning confusion, possibly to make some kind of point): \"OK..............?\"

IN CONCLUSION:

- I am aware that I am asking for a special exception, to eat regular French toast instead of berry/berry compote French toast on a Monday. 

- The tempe location HAS made the accommodation for me the past 3 times. \"Sure we can get you the regular kind, no problem!\"

- At no point has any previous employee wondered \"so when you say 'regular French toast...you mean like, no cinnamon and no sugar?!\" As a society, we all have a general understanding of what \"regular French toast\" is, with the exception of this Grey-hatted employee. 

- I never said \"bare French toast,\" \"plain French toast.\" My words were \"Regular French toast.\" I.e. bread, egg, cinnamon, sugar. (And a drop of vanilla extract). 

Why has every other Even Stevens employee completely understood this? But this gentleman seemed to have such a difficult time grasping the mere notion, that a man would want French toast without berry compote, on a Monday of all days!

Again, I know I'm asking for a special exception: regular French toast on a Monday. But, berry french toast is on the menu. I'm just saying, \"don't put the berries on it.\"

The previous 3 times, the employees completely understood, with no confusion. 
They didn't stammer back at me, scratching their head and asking things like: 

\"So uh....when you say \"regular French toast,\" do you still want a plate and a fork? Do you still want to eat it on a table?!\""}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to be working when a guy stopped by to hand us the menu and some $5 gift cards. This is my first experience at Even Stevens and it won't be my last. I'm so happy that they have vegan options available. The Jackfruit Torta was the best sandwich I've ever eaten. The bathrooms were clean and the atmosphere of this place was fun and unique. I'll be stopping here again to try more options that are available."}
{"text":"Just okay. Had the sprang chicken, not much flavor. We also got the party tots which tasted like frozen tater tots with flavorless cheese on top."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last week and let me tell you the salmon BLT was amazing. Each and every ingredient was perfect and went together very well. Also had the Brussel sprouts wish they were more soft."}
{"text":"Not only was the the food great but they donate sandwiches to those who are less fortunate. My Ruben sandwich ingredients were well balanced and it was not greasy nor dripping in sauce. The red cabbage kraut was mild and fresh. I loved that I had the option to have a side salad instead of potato chips at no additional charge."}
{"text":"I got a salad... it was just ok. I felt for a $9 salad that is \"chopped\" if would be chopped not such big pieces of lettuce and skimpy on the cheese crumbs. We also had the pretzel and beer cheese bites, they were better but still just an average quality. I like the concept to donating for each sandwich sold but I expected higher quality."}
{"text":"We love Even Stevens!  I've been here several times and haven't been disappointed with the food!  The jackfruit torta is messy to eat but fabulous. I also recommend the Capreezy. The atmosphere is uplifting and food is always fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Even Stevens and my wife and I both agree it's a place to go back to. It's a very open space restaurant so it could get a little noisy but not during lunch on Wednesday. My choice was the Turkey Day sandwich with chips, and pickle slice. The 'cran-peno' jelly was outstanding with just the right amount of bite. Beer is from San Tan brewery so choices are limited. Customer service, from a greeting to order been taken and food served was very polite. Since no place is perfect I'll mention that salt, pepper, and sauces are self serve from the front counter. We look forward to our next visit. Thank you."}
{"text":"We have been here 3 times. The first visit out order was wrong. The 2nd visit we waited over 30 mins for a sandwich. The 3rd visit our food sat at the counter for 5+ minutes while the waitress roamed around. I confronted her about it & she told me it hadn't been sitting there long & wouldn't let me take it. She insisted on bringing it to the table. AND there's a giant hairball on the floor. Food is great, service needs a lot work."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for sandwiches and the pretzels (so good). I'm a picky eater and asked for some items to be left off my sandwich and they got the order wrong (took off things I wanted on instead) so docking one star. Overall though I'll be back."}
{"text":"Their food is great and their business model is even better! On Sundays they have unlimited French toast for $3.75! The staff is friendly and welcoming. Laid back, hipster atmosphere. Unique and delicious sandwich options. A must-try!"}
{"text":"Turkey Pot Roast Dip - What a way to start my day!! I ventured into Even Stevens across from Arrowhead Town Center today, my first time. I was welcomed by friendly staff who helped me navigate the menu. Dude recommended the turkey pot roast dip as I was struggling to decide. Their entire menu looks delish. It comes on a fresh baguette (would have been happy eating the bread alone, so goooood), Swiss and jalapeño jelly. Ohhh, jalapeño jelly, where have you been all my life. This is a condiment I could put on everything!

My ONLY issue... no locations near my home! PLEASE open up a shop in N Scotts! Though, it's worth the drive. I'll be back to hang with my new friends (the staff here is super fun) and try a new sandwich."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great customer service and cute environment inside. Will definitely stop here again in the future. A+"}
{"text":"This place was not what I expected but in a good way. Much more then your basic sandwich shop. This place has a really cool space to hang out and enjoy your food . even a few classic board games to play . the food its self was good . I got the tomato basil soup which was fresh and very good and their cuban sanwhich which is not a true cuban but very good . decent size but not quite enough to fill me up how ever the meat was not over cooked or dry which is a problem with lots of places that attempt to make cubanos here. Will def come back and try some more of their stuff."}
{"text":"this is an awesome place in more ways than one, they gave back to local charities which i believe is awesome than it's also a sandwich shop/breakfast place also. they have your basic sandwiches that most places have that has that street of new York taste if you know what i mean and also unlimited french toast the last Sunday morning that i went in there."}
{"text":"I'm a very picky eater so sandwich shops are always a little tough to order at but the stellar cashier (Taylor) knew exactly how to walk me through the process of ordering! The presentation of my food was amazing and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Great menu and fast service. They say they are coming to Denver soon. I will be ready!"}
{"text":"I visited Even Stevens tonight to redeem a coupon for one free side that I had claimed on Facebook. The time I was here before, I ordered the salmon BLT to go, and it was so delicious I almost cried. So I ordered a salmon BLT this time, too. My coupon was for one free side, and the cashier (a super sweet woman whose name was Karyn? I think) recommended the seasonal vegetable, which happened to be maple bacon brussels sprouts. Ohh my word. They were the cherry on top of another wonderful dinner. The bread is so crunchy and fluffy and perfect. The flavors of the lettuce and tomatoes are awesome with the seasoned and perfectly cooked salmon, which is capped with slices of thick, crispy bacon. It was delicious this time around, too. The brussels sprouts had a bit of a vinegar taste to them, and as I was eating I tried to remember if she said maple vinaigrette. Hmm. Either way, everything was scrumptious. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I received a free cookie because I checked in and I decided to get the Sugar cookie and it was AMAZING. I had the stuffed french toast and it was so good. The berries that came with it were obviously frozen which was a little disappointing, but the french toast had a little bit of an orange zest taste which made it fun and different. This isn't somewhere that I'd crave necessarily but it was still good. My husband had the \"da gouda\" and I had a few bites. It was good but the sauce is very powerful so you can't quite taste the gouda. I love that they help with local charities in the area, great idea."}
{"text":"First time to this location, second time to try Even Stevens, still impressed with their food and the mission behind this chain. 

Located by ASU in downtown, this is a very convenient corner for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Tastefully decorated, like the other location I visited, the vibe makes you want to eat here. 

Even though their menu isn't huge, everything sounds so good.  My companion suggested the capreezy sandwich and I was definitely not expecting much from a vegetarian sandwich (I love meats and I'll always eat meats and that's where I stand on this topic.)  But this capreezy sandwich did not disappoint.  Warm, toasty bread sandwiching thick slices of mozzarella cheese, flavorful basil pesto, tomatoes and hints of balsamic vinegar - words cannot describe how fulfilling this simple caprese sandwich can be.  

The side salad that came with it was also delicious; mixed green with sliced cherry tomatoes and a ranch-like dressing but only better than ranch. 

The next day we came back for breakfast, and I had the stuffed french toast.  I've had the stuffed french toast before at a different location, and while this one was not as good as the one I've had before, it was still pretty darn good. The creamy filling with the sliced bananas are hard to beat, topped with the berries compote.  The only gripe was that the edge of the toast was a bit hard, which could be easily fixed with some extra berries compote, but it didn't bother me enough to make the extra effort.  

The staff are friendly and professional.  We hung around for another hour or so after we finished our meals and we picked a game out of the game bins behind the couch and were never bothered.  You can also dine al fresco and enjoy the Phoenix weather.  Absolutely a fan of Even Stevens' food and charitable cause."}
{"text":"Only second time here. First time was a bust but today the Mihami Vice was delicious. If they keep up the good work I will become a regular."}
{"text":"Great concept for a restaurant. Games to make eachother interact. Staff was friendly and really made sure you had a great experience. The mimosas are where it's at specifically the mixed berry mimosa. If you want a champagne not too sweet but just right make sure u get the mixed berry mimosa. I had the endless French toast. Tots and bacon. I would say the bacon is great when asked for crispy. They were extremely busy when I went but I will say they make sure ur still treated well."}
{"text":"Even Stevens is so conveniently located but I've only seen it busy at lunch time. Please please please support this venue so it will keep the long hours. Phoenix needs this kind of touch. 

The space is nice with a comfy couch, patio seating, and plenty tables. Need I say more? 

Okay...
young charming staff
poppin' music
good community cause
quick service
delightful jackfruit sammich

The bad: the tater tots. The taste is straight outta the bag from the frozen aisle.

But I will be back 
to snack
on another jack
cos i luvs it like my daddy mack"}
{"text":"Great food! We went here for lunch and had to go back and try breakfast, which was fabulous too! We loved: reuben, do gouda, and kettle and queso. And for breakfast: breakfast sandwich, breakfast burrito, and stuffed french toast. Everything is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"It's just ok. Sandwiches are decent if you are trying to get away from Sub style sandwich. The atmosphere is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff was welcoming and friendly. The food was delicious. We started with the Beer Cheese and Pretzel Sticks then I had the Do Gouda and the hubby had the Reuben. We enjoyed everything from the staff to the food and most importantly that they have partnered up with non-profits in the community."}
{"text":"My sandwich was a recommended combination of a grilled cheese and steak, super delicious with a little heat - jalapeños!  I love that they donate proceeds to local charities!"}
{"text":"V dope. V good. Go here and have lunch or a sandwich. Cripsy lettuce. So good mouth feel--wow. Enjoyed the flavors and good spices here."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous addition to downtown Phoenix. Literally everything on the menu is amazing. I live downtown and work downtown as well and few restaurants can rival the pleasant eating experience that is Even Stevens. I highly recommend the JP grilled cheese! One of the most amazing things I've ever eaten. 

Side note: to the people complaining about parking. Welcome to downtown Phoenix. Everywhere is either metered or its garage parking. That's not the businesses fault and a stupid reason to lower your rating of a downtown business. Take that up with the city."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and quick. Had the Do Gouda and it was AMAZING, im excited to try more when I visit again."}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious everything. I ate breakfast here the past two days and lunch, all 4 masks were ridiculously good. This place is inexpensive and the ingredients are high quality. Everyone is super nice and they even donate to charity for every meal. I hope they keep expanding!!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. As everyone has stated, the food is just delicious and fresh as can be. I don't know how they are making money since the sandwiches don't cost very much AND they donate a sandwich for every one sold. This place is just unreal.

The atmosphere is really cool, all kinds of restored old train and farming parts, really cool light fixtures and all the employees are super helpful in explaining the menu, keeping the place really clean and also just being friendly in general.

The entire business model is super charitable, but I just can't get over how ridiculously good the food is. For 6-8 bucks you get a giant breakfast sandwich, or a full size prime rib dip or incredible stuffed French toast. 

This place can't be beat, I hope they open even more locations!"}
{"text":"One the weekends, this is a great place to come with friends, to relax and enjoy some good breakfast or lunch, and local craft brews.Tucked away from the busy Heritage District Strip, but still in the middle of it all. Great location! I told myself, to try a new sandwich, each time I come.  The staff is very friendly and informative. I tried breakfast here the first time, and the eggs were a little dry. They have the best mimosa on this side of town!!!  You can also feel good while you eat here, because every sandwich you purchase, they match the $ amount to go to local non-profits, such as A New Leaf, United Food Bank, and The Boys & Girls Club. They also have all you can eat French Toast on the weekends. I would personally prefer bottomless mimosas! I think this place is great new addition to the HD Strip."}
{"text":"Soooo rude just walked in to grab a drink and no one was at the counter, I stood there for a couple minutes finally someone comes up and I just say yep just here to get a drink, they only sell one size, and she goes okay what can I help you with and I repeat a drink and she starts screaming at me \"I asked you what\" so rude will never go here again and I actually run a tour company in the area will tell everyone about my horrible experience. I wish I had her name but she's a younger girl who obviously hasn't learned how to treat a customer yet"}
{"text":"Great service and even better food! I got the sprang chicken with ranch. Delicious! Plus food always tastes better when you are helping an awesome cause!

S/O to rhythm for the awesome service"}
{"text":"It's a big, comfy sandwich shop with an altruistic twist--customers aren't just paying for their own food, but helping feed those in need as well. It's like TOMS shoes, but with your lunch. 

Anyway, it's convenient. There's plenty of seating, and even a giant TV where folks can watch sports. They've got a few beers, and if you feel like being cheap the aluminum pints of Coors Light are $2. I don't know how many you can order before they give you concerned looks. =) 

Anyway, I ordered the So Gouda, with thinly-shaved steak, onions, and gouda. It was just OK. The bread didn't seem like anything special, and it was toasted in a manner that made it incredibly crunchy and crumbly. I really enjoyed the chips that came with it, and the price overall was good, so I won't complain. 

If you're on the light rail and totally starving, I'd say look for this. If you want a really good sandwich, keep on going."}
{"text":"Food is delightfully flavorful. Staff is friendly. Atmosphere is fun and inviting. So far my favorite item is the breakfast burrito with avocado, spinach and onions. :)"}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere reminded me of Iceland eateries. My husband and I loved this spot. We ordered two of their local beers (so crisp!) along with our sandwiches. Try the capreezy, ya'll! It's a light and tasty sandwich that won't make you feel like your stomach just expanded. Excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch while in downtown Phoenix. I had the Banh Mi sandwich with Mahi instead of pork very tasty. Also try the bravo tots. They donate a sandwich for every sandwich ordered to local non profit partners. 
A must if in downtown Phoenix"}
{"text":"I was already in Arcadia so I decided to stop by here on an early afternoon. I got a to-go Breakfast Sandwich that came with two medium eggs (or scrambled, if you prefer that), bacon, house maple glaze, and cheddar cheese in a Hawaiian bun. It also came with a side of tater tots. This sandwich was honestly pretty great for a breakfast sandwich, especially the unique addition of the Hawaiian bun. 

However, the service here when I went was not too welcoming and slow (for a quiet afternoon). What I expected to be a quick wait, the breakfast sandwich, turned out taking between 15-20 minutes to come out. I was short on time and made sure to order something that seemed simple and quick enough to make, but that wasn't the case, unfortunately. Since I enjoyed my sandwich, I'd consider coming back here, but probably not for a while and only if I have enough time to sit around and wait."}
{"text":"On a whim we decided to check out the hip and happening new Even Stevens sandwich shop for lunch. Parking was a breeze, and when we walked in we were warmly greeted by the staff and a charming atmosphere.

We wanted to order food to go, so we studied the menu for a bit and then placed our order. We got the turkey sandwich with a side salad, breakfast burrito, and the breakfast sandwich with tater tots. After our order was placed we discovered the ability to make the turkey sandwich a lettuce wrap and immediately the gal putting orders together made the change, no problem! Our order took a while, so next time we will call ahead to place an order without the wait. Waiting wasn't a big deal however because the inside of Even Stevens is very comfortable and inviting. 

The sandwich shop is large with plenty of seating including tables with chairs, and even a nook in the corner with cushioned booths and tvs to watch a game or whatever. They also have a little section for the kiddos with toys and games so adults and kids are happy! When we were waiting for our food they had live music playing in the corner; the music was pleasant and not too loud. The staff was extremely competent, hard working, and friendly. 

When we finally got our order we headed out to enjoy it at home. The breakfast burrito and the breakfast sandwich were works of art; they looked unbelievable! The taste however left much to be desired. The eggs were overdone, the tater tots were underdone, and the salsa lacked flavor. The turkey sandwich lettuce wrap was a wreck due to the poor wrap job. No worries though, we ate it like a salad. The flavor was decent, but nothing to write home about, and the side salad was just greens. Despite the mediocrity of the food for our first experience we will be back to try other things. 

I recommend trying it for yourself; the atmosphere is charming, staff is welcoming, and it seems like a chill place to meet with friends and grab a bite."}
{"text":"This was our first time at an Even Stevens and despite being newly opened, it was a very good experience. We dropped in on a Sunday morning around 10a. This restaurant is the only open business in this new development so no parking issues. The ordering process seems a bit unorganized and a bit of a delay but otherwise not a deal breaker at all. The entire staff that we interacted with were very friendly and attentive even after our order was delivered. 

The space is very open and a great vibe. You could sit and work comfortably and there appeared to be power outlets with USBs scattered throughout. We ordered the Ruben and the breakfast sandwich (with ham, avocado). The Ruben came with a salad and the breakfast sandwich with tots. Both sandwiches were very savory and tasty. And you can't beat $3 mimosas on Sunday either! 

Most importantly, it is what this restaurant stands for in giving back to the community and local charities that makes it even better. Please come check it out when in the area. E"}
{"text":"We are pretty much new to this place and we love the delicious food and very friendly and welcoming staff. This is our second time since the opening day. Alejandra was our server this last time we were in and she was outstanding. Nice atmosphere. Thanks for bringing your restaurant to downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"I'm still a fan of the sandwich.  It is actually very good.  I also like the concept of matching donations.  That is pretty much where it ends though.  My daughter just arrived from LA and we decided to try Even Stevens again, this time for a dine-in.

I am happy to say that nobody yelled at us when we walked in.  Props.  They changed the Bahn Mi name on the menu, more props.

We stood in line behind five people for about 15 minutes, I guess while the one woman that was taking orders figured out the machine she was using.  When we finally came up, there was no \"sorry for the wait\" or any other cordiality, basically a \"whaddya want\".  The daughter orders.  The wife orders.  I order.  I spied a huge sign as we walked in, advertising a smoked Brisket sandwich.  I asked for that.  \"THATS NOT UNTIL JULY 3!  IT SAYS SO ON THE SIGN!\" spoken with a hint of irritation.  Well, I didn't argue.  I checked the menu again and ordered the \"Do Gouda\" - we had the same sandwiches as last time, only this time I told them to leave off the jam.  I then asked for a side of tots.  \"THE SANDWICHES COME WITH CHIPS OR SALAD!\".  spoken harshly with a glare.  Um, well, okay, I'll have chips.  May I also have the tots, or is it not allowed?  I got the tots.  phew!  My wife asked about what flavors of tea do you have?, Angry cashier girl looks at her like she's from pluto.  I tried to help - what blends?  WE HAVE BLACK TEA, I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WHICH!\".  Well, okay then, we'll just have the tea.

Now the wife goes to pay.  They use this credit-card app that the angry cashier swings the terminal around so my wife could complete the transaction.  There was an automatic tip calculation - 25%, 20%, 18% or \"other\".  She chose \"other\" and left ZERO.  That automatically adding a tip to our bill really is irritating - this is a fast-casual place, not full-service.  After the cashiers attitude, we just wanted to eat and get out as quickly as possible.

When getting our tea, we noticed no lemon wedges.  There are bowls of fake lemons and limes displayed all about the dining room, but nary a real lemon to be found.  After sitting, I decided I'd like some extra aoli for the tots.  I went up to the window, where the angry girl was and asked her for some extra aoli - again the \"Are you from Pluto? look\".  sigh.

Really?  I was so much hoping for better, especially after the very kind response to my first review.  This experience just put me off of Even Stevens.  You can match 50 to 1 sandwiches, but after today, I won't be back, and honestly, I'm not surprised the dining room was nearly empty for the time we spent there.  Probably scared everybody off. There are too many other decent places around that actually appreciate my business 

The sandwiches are delicious.  The concept is to be applauded.  The service/attitude however, very off-putting.  When leaving, I took a picture of the sign.  Notice the really small print for the available date?  Gee, sorry I missed that the first time around.  I can assure you, you won't have me making that mistake again."}
{"text":"I love this place! Excellent for lunch or quick bite to eat. The staff is incredibly friendly & the food is ALWAYS fresh. (Try the breakfast sandwich)"}
{"text":"I like this play more and more and more and more. Good people, making good food, for a good cause. Dig it. We just used their catering for a corporate lunch event, and it was great to be able to share their message and all enjoy the awesome sandwiches. The store was quick to communicate, personable and the food was fantastic. Nicely done."}
{"text":"I only have tried this sandwich shop once but it wasn't great or bad. I will probably give it another try but definitely not my favorite sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Quick response and goodwill gesture to my issues on our last visit. We returned for some more delicious sandwiches and service was great this time. Very busy lunch rush, but food was quick and accurate. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great staff! Uniquely decorated! I had the Sprang Chicken and it was delicious! I will definitely be back on my next visit to Tempe!"}
{"text":"When I walked into this restaurant, my wife and I were greeted by a very friendly person working the register and taking orders. Happy faces early in the morning are sometimes hard to come by! 

We placed our order, I got the undergrad breakfast burrito, it was one heavy burrito, and it had everything -great texture, great cheese and great tastes. 

They also had some good coffee in the house!

S/O to a great breakfast burrito and S/O to good coffee."}
{"text":"Had lunch here recently!  Great sandwiches and a definite step above the usual sub joints!  The pot roast sandwich will bring back fond memories!  Can't believe they got that oldy but goody into a sandwich.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"When in Phoenix EAT HERE!!! Come here!!! Great food. Great people. And a purpose! These guys absolutely got it right!"}
{"text":"I went there because of the reviews and b/c they give back to the community.

I ordered a breakfast burrito with any issues, no waiting.
The order was taking a long time and so I asked the server where it was.  He said they burned the tortilla and had to make another...what?  Then why would several people after me get there order?  Don't lie to customers, just own up to losing my order.  Still another 7 minutes goes by before I get my burrito and it's not very good, kinda bland, including the salsa they provide.
Sorry, but the service and the food are not worth the frustration or disappointment.

Like that they give back, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"BLT salad....YUCK! The few pieces of pork belly were pure FAT. Not much cheese or chips to help the salad taste better either. Called to complain but the number rang busy for 1 hour, almost like it was off the hook. Less than impressed. Pretty bummed since I have had good experiences in the past and work down the street from this location. Hope this was a one time experience but not sure I will be giving them another try after this."}
{"text":"Wow! I love the atmosphere here. It's very open and clean. It's fun in there, as they have cartoons drawn on the wall and there's lots of board games by the entrance. The staff are really cool too. Very friendly and helpful. The guy that was running the food was busy but he doesn't show it, he was very friendly and asked how everyone's experience was. 

It was my first time here. The girl taking the orders suggested I try the Cuban as it was their most ordered one. I decided to order the banh mi and substituted the pork for mahi for a dollar more. Mmmm! It was sooo good! I love their version of the banh mi. I was worried about the bread, because it looked big and difficult to eat, but it wasn't! It was crunchy yet soft. I loved it. Instead of chips, I had the salad and that was very good too. I hope they expand with more locations in south Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches and super friendly staff. Can't wait to try the breakfast burrito next time."}
{"text":"Love this place. I had the Cubano Sandwich, and it was so tasty. Place is super clean. I loved that. Hannah was simply incredible and nice. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy myself at Even Stevens, no matter what location I'm at. The service is top of the line... every other business should figure out how they hire such amazing employees. The breakfast is pretty great too - large sandwich on a makeshift Hawaiian role... hell yes. The lunch sandwiches are great too and add a cookie with pink icing.. YUM. 

They also do catering... I highly recommend the boxed lunches. They're pretty incredible and really easy."}
{"text":"If you aren't a fan of the hustle and bustle of the main Gilbert Road strip than this is definitely the place for you. In a tiny parking lot about 100 feet behind ZinBurger and all the other places is where this shop is located. 

I went in and was literally the only person in there who wasn't staff until about halfway through my sandwich, which I wasn't complaining about at all. It's a great spot. Very casual. Seems like a place where you and some friends could just hang out for awhile. 

I had a sandwich and some chips which were absolutely delicious. No complaints what so ever. They also gave me a free cookie for checking in and the cookie was amazing. 

The only negative about the location is that there is no name indicators on the sidewalk or on the glass. And the sign above the restaurant is hidden by the awning. The only recommendation for the business is to find a sign to put on the sidewalk cause I definitely walked straight past. 

All in all a fantastic experience. 10/10 would reccomend."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast--the stuffed French toast is amazing! Piled high with a variety of berries and filled with a sweet cream cheese, it hits the spot! Pair with a big cuppa fresh coffee and you're set!"}
{"text":"Free Mothers Day French toast!  It was delicious. I got the Brioche style and my son got the stuffed version with berries, bananas, cream cheese filling. Berry mimosas topped it off. The staff were super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"My experience really started out in the parking lot. As this is a busy shopping center you can imagine parking is a little hard to come by. Which is why I found it even more odd to see a Even Steven company truck parked in one of the few prime parking spots directly in front of the building. After I safely shuttled my children across the hot black top parking lot we walked into a wide open inviting layout of a place. The ordering was straight forward however the large menu had no details about the items you could order. Afterwards I headed to the booths along the wall to claim a seat. Thinking all the booths were occupied I finally spotted one at the end that looked  empty. As I approach I realize that it had a laptop and drink and was taken by one of the people who work there. The two stars are for the actual sandwich(which was overpriced) but tasted good."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend Sunday around 12:15 and there was no wait. A nice man was playing acoustic covers of various songs which was a surprising contributor to the ambiance. Very hipster and friendly. The food was ok - I think I would have liked the breakfast sandwich better if I was hungover since it was delicious but huge and greasy - and the mimosas were mostly orange juice but for $3 I certainly will not complain. The French toast was great! The party tots were not really down to party. I definitely want to go back and try their sandwiches. 

Overall, this was a cool little place, the food was good, and the prices are very reasonable. One thing to note - the Dutch Bros next door made getting into the parking lot tricky, but once we were in there was a ton of parking."}
{"text":"We took a chance at a new place for breakfast sandwiches as we didn't have time to go to a restaurant and sit. The food was very good, very reasonably priced and was much more than the three of us could eat. In addition to a huge sandwich, we each were given a cup of tater tots. Each of our meals was in a separate bag which was nice. The person who helped us explained the concept of the business. For every sandwich sold, they essentially give food back to the community they are located in to help serve the low income and homeless population. Very impressed!"}
{"text":"I had the Sprang Chicken with Chips and it was delicious. My BF had the Reuben with salad and he love his as well. 4 of our girls ordered Macaroni...and 3 of them loved it and the 1 said it was ok. Our boy ordered French Toast and he said it was ok as well. Overall, we enjoyed our 1st visit. The staff,  Peyten, was very attentive. Loved that they have name tags! The place is super cute and clean! The kids loved that they had a \"gaming\" area. We also got a FREE cookie because I checked in so I let our youngest pick it out and of course she picked their PINK FROSTED SUGAR COOKIE...and it's the highlight of going there (besides the gaming area) and it's super yummy!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at the Van buren street location and am generally fond of even Stevens ,but this store did not meet me or my wife's expectations... First off a staff member man with black curly hair was smoking a cigarette on the phone outside , then comes in and goes to the kitchen without even washing his hands! That grossed my wife out, she didn't even order anything. I ordered my usual ;the Morrissey and it took 15 minutes. (Not too mad about that because it was busy)  The music was blaring, that kind of bothered me but it was Green Day so it was cool. Then the  curly haired guy with an accent was not accommodating to me or my wife when we asked for information regarding the complex, and responded with smug and non-genuine service. ES staff is usually very friendly and generous but I didn't feel the same atmosphere here . The food was prepared well, but I do not appreciate the vibe of this store. I will continue going to the location on van buren but see no reason to return to here. The valet was also a huge annoyance. Even though the valet guy meant well and  was very courteous and professional to my wife but I shouldn't have to pay to park at a restaurant like this . Overall 4/10."}
{"text":"After checking out some vintage spots nearby, my fiance and I decided eat here because of their great reviews and menu. 

We were lucky to find parking spot in front of the joint and fed the meter $2 via credit card and were excited to check the place out.

Unfortunately,  as we entered the restaurant we encountered a horrible sewage or rotten egg sulfar-kind of smell.  In less than a minute we decided to leave instead of ordering.  The stink was too bad to take a chance at eating this food much less staying in that building.  

I'm not trying to hate on this place... maybe they were having issues that day... but the first thing you smell should not be a rotten stench but delicious food.  YMMV."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill since the last time I was here. The food was slop, at best. Cold & not cooked all the way. Tried enjoying my dinner on the patio but that was also ruined by the type of customers this place attracts. A woman yelling on her cell phone and cussing every other word. I cuss too, but I don't yell in a public place where I'm going to disturb other people trying to enjoy a night out. I used to love this place. I won't be back.
Update: this patron is now blowing her nose and tossing the napkins over the patio so they're landing on the sidewalk. Classy! Disgusting humans."}
{"text":"I came into Even Stevens and ordered a pork belly bahn mi.  It wasn't a bad sandwich it just wasn't amazing for its price. The flavors were overwhelming and the pork belly was underwhelming. It came with a salad on the side which had no dressing that wasn't anything special. 

I think that it's possible that I had a bad experience or chose the wrong item and I may end up trying it out again."}
{"text":"I ordered a Reuben sandwich, it was hot but did not have any taste. The sauce also did not have flavor. My husband ordered a steak and gouda sandwich is also dry with no flavor. I have tasted Reubens before so I was expecting more when I ordered it because they make their sauce."}
{"text":"Ordered the sprang chicken online, picked it up in store, got to work, opened up the bag and realized I  was given the vegetarian sandwich.....

Looks like I need to find a new sandwich place"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious .  Always get my food in such a great time . Staff is so friendly , always smiling . I love the non profit organizations they work with ."}
{"text":"5 stars across the board! The best part is that they give back to the community as a \"sandwich shop with a cause\" donating sandwiches and feeding thousands of people in the area. After we had already ordered, my grandpa saw a breakfast meal going out to someone else that he didn't realize he could still order at lunch time and asked if it were possible to switch his order. The man who took our order accommodated my grandpa's request immediately, with a smile. He was incredibly friendly and helpful as were all of the staff. That's key to me and the service really stood out, everyone seemed genuinely happy to be there. The meals were just delicious with many unique options. I'm so happy I found this place on Yelp!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 separate times for lunch, and I've enjoyed the food and service each time. They need to drastically improve their breakfast offerings if they are going to advertise it so much on social media. This past Sunday was our first time trying their breakfast menu. They have a board outside advertising $3 mimosas and $4.50 all-you-can-eat French toast. They also offer a single serving of mixed berry stuffed French toast for $5.50. The empty restaurant at 10am on Sunday (prime brunch time) should have been my first clue. I decided to try the AYCE French toast. I didn't expect anything stellar for the price, but I expected it to actually resemble basic French toast. It was very dry like plain toast and served without butter, only syrup. 

Pros: excellent lunch entrees, delicious mimosas, friendly service. 

Cons: AYCE French toast was dry and inedible and tasted like regular/dry toast with sugar on top."}
{"text":"I have to admit....it actually feels good to know that for every sandwich sold, that one us being donated to a local non profit partner to feed homelessness!!! First i though $10 for a sandwich, then I said, well at least we can afford one....!!! And that's when the idea struck me as brilliant! What a Millennial idea!!"}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich here is  definitely the sprang chicken. There is so much flavor in their food! With it I had the lemony asparagus and that was also excellent! We ended up liking their food so much we came back for breakfast burritos the following weekend! In addition to that, the staff is great, always friendly and smiling when people come in."}
{"text":"Not too bad actually. I got the sausage breakfast sandwich and a coffee. 

So the sandwich is really generous , two eggs, two (apparently maple) sausage patties, cheese and a nice soft bun. A little greasy and rich but overall pretty edible. 
The coffee too was also good. 
My only complaint, is there was a container in the bag and I opened it to find some unexpected tater tots crammed in. Okay. Sure, who hates free tater tots? 
But when I popped one into my mouth??? Yuck, no. Not only was it undercooked, it tasted like it was at LEAST a day old. *barf* both the unappealing flavor and texture made me want to chuck up the delicious sandwich and coffee.
I spit it back out, into its little white container and tossed the whole thing. I've had stale tots before, but nothing that bad before."}
{"text":"Great sandwich place and nice decor. I was only in town for a short time and needed a bite and something for later. They specially packed it so when I was ready I had WOW pot roast and cubanos. I am back in town and I am going for coffee and a breakfast burrito and leaving with a cubano."}
{"text":"This place is a much-needed breath of fresh air in downtown where the options are limited to Subway,Cvs,and a few other places.

I read about this establishment and saw that they're active within the community helping local charities, i.e. Saint Vincent de Paul and few other food pantries.

I walked in and was immediately greeted by a young lady in her early 20s and who took my order. 

I settled on the JP grilled cheese with jalapenos and a lot of cheese with a side of chips, and I must say that I was pretty pleased at my decision to come here.

Definitely would come back"}
{"text":"I ordered online and when I came to pick up my order everything every employees seem very nice but when I got home and unwrapped by grilled cheese it was burned what a bummer and a waste of money I will not return check your sandwiches before you leave"}
{"text":"Great gourmet sandwich spot. First time! Approached at entry before could get through the menus we grabbed by the door. We ordered the Jalapeño grilled cheese w/ fruit cup, and Caprese sandwich with side salad. Everything was overall pretty good. Great service. Friendly inviting, atmosphere."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch while I was in Phoenix in January. I had the Morrissey (Vegan) breakfast burrito and a local beer - both were great. I think I also had the tater tots. Food was great and I enjoyed their interior design. I love that they don't waste food and donate to charity. This place also seemed to attract cool individuals. Parking was easy, fun, & free in the structure. I'll post the cute picture I took later."}
{"text":"Even Stevens is an instant hit!  I feel that the owner Michael did everything right.  He seemed to be very excited and extremely friendly to everyone that attended.  I took a picture of the menu, and I love how it is not overwhelming with items to a point where it's hard to choose the right meal.  In my case, I chose the pot roast dip sandwich and omg!! It was very delicious.  Usually when I eat toasted bread it slices my gums up. But this bread was baked to perfection for people like me!  It crumbled perfectly and was very flakey and easy to eat.  I read that it had jalapeño jelly but didn't expect it to pair so well.  It was amazing and I want another one just thinking about it!  They also had, probably the best cookie I've ever eaten, jelly in the center and a peanut butter cookie - so amazing!

They had a vendor/partner there that actually made the jalapeño jelly for the pot roast dip sandwich.  Her name was Amanda and they have been making jellies and jams in her family for years, actually a secret recipe that her grandma came up with (Cotton Country Jams) - amazing.  The honey jalapeño was very tasty as well. 

Lastly, another vendor explained how special their batch of coffee was because it came from her own family's farm in Brazil.  I've actually seen this brand before but never knew too much about it.  Her name was Julia and she was extremely sweet and very knowledgeable about her coffee.. I definitely look forward to grinding these beans up and making some authentic Brazilian coffee.. (PEIXOTO coffee)

All in all I had an amazing night, I love the openness of Even Stevens, and will definitely come back for more.  Thank you to all of the staff there for the invite:)"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches with a nice toast and abundance of delicious flavors. Love that you can get half sandwich/soup/salad or a whole with a side salad! Fresh taste and friendly staff. Looks like a fun place to hang out with folks of all ages. I took my Turkey to go. Yum!"}
{"text":"Nice concept to donate some of the proceeds to a charity. The decor and music is all over the place though. The music is way too loud and people have to shout to talk. My vegan burrito was made with a premix of veggies that had way too many onions and even though you ask for light onions they don't tell you this until after. I like that they have WiFi of course and some of the food is really good."}
{"text":"I cant stop going to this establishment.  All of their sandwiches rock!!!  Their best sandwich is their banh mi.  You gotta try it.  And while you're there order the party tots! I swear they put crack on their party tots cause I keep coming back for more. Their tots are addictive :)"}
{"text":"Wow I would like to know how is it possible to make such an amazing breakfast sandwich. I would give this place 10 stars if I could, the pork belly sandwich is like a Zen moment, I seriously was sad/glad at the last bite. Sad it was gone glad that it was the right size so I didn't over eat. if it was any bigger I would have ate it all and regretted it. The employees are top notch two thumbs way up super friendly and very helpful. Hector and team thank you I will be back many many times. I was told the Mihami is off the hook  so that will be my next try... get here enjoy."}
{"text":"I went with a friend and while she seemed ok with her meal, I got the torta sandwich...uh, this was not a torta. In fact this was the worst whatever sandwich ever. It smelled and tasted like vinegar, I could not taste anything else. I doubt I'll return not impressed"}
{"text":"Even Stevens is quite the sandwich shop! Staff is extremely friendly and inviting. I would highly recommend this place any friend or family member! I will see you again Even Stevens!!"}
{"text":"I had the Capreezy.  Ingredients were fresh, sandwich was really good, just one small problem....that was the tiniest sandwich known to man!!  This was my only time here, so perhaps I was just unlucky and had the bread from the end of the package? For $10 though, you really need to make a bigger sandwich than that my friends!!"}
{"text":"I had such a hard time deciding on what to order.. everything sounded incredible. The employees were super friendly and the food was delicious. I can't wait to go back! 
Except the tots... they were nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and trendy inside but gives back to the community ten fold. Great deals and perfect location.    I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches - I will be back. The front check out girl Lindsey was attentive and gave great recommendations of what to eat and boy was she right. I love the food and atmosphere and will be back! Be sure to get the spring chicken it was phenomenal :)"}
{"text":"There's so much to like about Even Stevens food! Normally when I'm not in a gym nutrition challenge, they're one of my go-tos when I don't have dinner ready- it's normally quick service and the food (whether breakfast or dinner) is good! 
The setup is a little weird, it's like they can't decide whether to have waiters or counter service. 

Unfortunately that's why I can't give them 5/5. Most of the times I go, it takes about 5-10min for an employee to acknowledge me and come to the counter to ring me up. I understand that they're probably college kids with homework, but your job is to pay attention to your job, even if the place is dead. 

The vibe is totally kitschy 70's basement like in That 70's Show, and I love it. A few times I've not been in a rush on the weekend and sat on one of the comfy couches, propped back, ate my food and read a paper. It's like a cafe that's taken up a notch.

My fave menu items are the Grad Breakfast Burrito sans tomatoes and the Jackfruit Torta. If they are out of sides for a sandwich, they'll normally give you a (fairly sad) side salad of just greens and dressing. Oh and did I mention the sugar cookies?! Check in on Yelp to get yours fo' free."}
{"text":"The humanizing vegan was amazing and the gluten free bread is vegan and tastes like heaven!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm super excited about this place! My husband and I went there for a day date. He go the Do Gouda with chips and I got the Ruben with side salad. Both were amazing. The only thing I wish is that had brewed ice tea vs canned tea...then again I'm a tea snob. Everything was great! Great food! Greet Service! Great Space! Most of all Great Cause!!! Job well done!"}
{"text":"We celebrated a 50th wedding anniversary and 70th birthdays this past weekend. We had Even Stevens cater this event. We met with Erica O'Daniel at the shop two weeks prior. Took all of 15 minutes to complete the order. She arrived at our home on time and set up the trays. Sandwiches were fresh, fruit platter fresh and same went for the veggie platter. Proof of that - not a single sandwich was left uneaten and fruit & veggie platters pretty much consumed.  Diverse group so you kinda worry if a sandwich will work. Well it does. Easy to manage as well. Thanks Erica for a job well done"}
{"text":"The food was great! My only problem was with the service. The guy at the front counter was very friendly and it was clear he had great customer service skills. My only problem was with the guy who served me my food, Joe. He threw it down in front of me without saying a word and walked off. I saw him deliver food to other tables and he did not act that way. Server needs to work on his customer service skills because he was down right rude."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure to sample numerous options on the menu and was not disappointed! I really enjoy the pot roast dip! 

I often utilized the check in offer too for the free cookie as those are excellent as well! 

Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Super cute lounge for students to hang out and study. Staff is really friendly, and the sandwiches are great, too. Free coffee for ASU students!!! I recommend stopping in if you have the chance, for every sandwich you buy, they donate a sandwich-- contribute to a great cause!"}
{"text":"First time customer. Courteous order taker. Got the pot roast sandwich since the sweet girl that took my order said it was her favorite. Loved the entire order although I'd get the jalapeno jelly light next time. Otherwise, big fan, will be back!"}
{"text":"This is the second time this has happened. I'm done coming back here. They just gave me pretty much bacon fat in my breakfast burrito. Gross. I don't understand how they don't notice that."}
{"text":"Found on Yelp
Wanted a breakfast sandwich and figured I would give them a try.
One of the best Breakfast Sandwiches I have ever had. The eggs were perfect and the roll was awesome.
Topped it off with some Mac and cheese.
I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of That 70s Show (which is a huge plus). Super cool and chill atmosphere. The food is here is pretty good and reasonably priced. I believe they even had $1 colors lights if I'm not mistaken. They are speedy with getting the food out so it's a great spot for a lunch break. I wish they had some more info on their nutritional facts but that's being petty. Great spot over all and recommend my buddies at work to try it."}
{"text":"Very very tasty selection , but don't expect a Hardy meal. I had the Bomb Mi and it was excellent. I upgraded to mahi mahi there was a small piece in the sandwich :-). They have a decent selection local beers also. The orange week was really a good choice for me. Like an orange shock Top on steroids. Other than being a lighter meal I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This place was good. It is a simple sandwich shop. The menu is small. I had the sprung chicken and Mac and cheese. Both did the job of getting me a quick meal on the go. I will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. Awesome employees, the sandwiches were amazing!!! Highly recommend for a good deli style sandwich"}
{"text":"I wont be back. I tried 3 sandwiches. The dip one had a ton of sweet relish on it that was interesting but ruined it with excess. The Reuben was dry but just nothing special. The Chicken sandwich my wife had seemed to be all cheese, bread, and meat, actually they all seemed to be that way, like a weird balance. Anywho, not terrible but nothing I cant top a few blocks away from my house like Main Ingredient's RB&C, so not worthy of a second visit."}
{"text":"Although I applaud the effort to be different, it was not good.  Not everyone wants spice in their sandwiches, and they could do better.  I would re-think the menu and learn how to do a real grilled cheese."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Super affordable, great food, super-friendly staff, and so casual!The best part of all is that they partner with non-profits, so every sandwich sold, they donate a sandwich! I can't believe I had never heard of this place before.. I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Let's try the Jalapeno grilled cheese sandwich, which turns out to taste like a big Jalapeno popper pocket...simply delish. Oh yeah, then let's add the grilled Jack fruit sandwich to that order which comes on a super soft bun and packed with flavor...tasty. lastly, for desert let's throw in a freshly baked sugar cookie smeared with a buttercream spread on top of it that are both whipped up and made in house. Solid experience with live solo acoustic music and friendly customer service. Thoroughly enjoyed."}
{"text":"This place rocks sandwiches like a boss and donates proceeds in the process! We stumbled on this sandwich shop by chance after arriving in town before restaurants  opened for lunch but needing a good meal after traveling and being two hours off our time zone. They were open and served breakfast and sandwiches all day, so we gave them a go.

They are on the corner of a small shopping area surrounded by local shops and other hidden restaurants, which gave the allocation a quaint feel that was quickly turned trendy and modern by the interior of the shop. The decor is trendsetter with a touch of texture from the seventies; the colors are modern and the music is popular hits. The staff was very friendly, welcomed us, and talked through the menu with us. They were laughing and talking he entire time we were there, obviously enjoying their time together.

I ordered the JP Grilled Cheese and loved every bite! I got the roasted garlic jalapeños on the side and still had a little trouble with how spicy the sauce was, but it was delicious nonetheless. It is definitely not for the faint of palate. But the bread was fresh and crunchy, the cheeses were velvety and rich, and the combination of flavors was perfection when paired with their salt and pepper chips. My SO ordered a breakfast sandwich and said with her last bite that it was so well balanced that it tasted like a thoughtful sandwich rather a breakfast item for only the morning.

We count ourselves lucky to have discovered this place so soon on our trip and will be back before we head home! Tasty, intelligent sandwiches with a purpose in helping local non-profits? Go for it!"}
{"text":"Great Sandwich shop in Downtown Gilbert.  Tried the pot roast dip with a side salad and they tasted flavorful and fresh.  Live music and great food on a Saturday afternoon.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Have never written a Yelp review but felt I should so people are aware. Got the tots and they were cold and undercooked, but worst of all I got the Bohn Mi and the pork was raw, so raw the bread was soggy,  but they tried to cover it with the lettuce, I took the sandwich apart, it almost made me throw up. Won't be recommending or going here again, just wanted to warn people because that can be very dangerous and cause people to be very ill. I am mortified that my order ever left the kitchen, so scary."}
{"text":"Excellent concept, price does reflect their contributional concept though.. That being said.. 

Food is excellent, fresh bread both time I have been here..

MiHami Vice, great spin on a Cuban sammich, wihtout the overpowering mustard as in most locations, and love the pickle spears in the sammich itself.. 

Rueben, Wife had this one and she said it has been one of the best Ruebens she has had, second compared to Rocket Burger,, lol,,

Will Def be back, !!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely outstanding. I have been back 4 times now and everything ordered, sprang chicken, pot roast dip, breakfast sandwich, and mihami vice has been fantastic. It is not close to my work at all but I keep finding myself coming back at lunch time!! Artisan coffee from the place next door and local San Tan Brewery beer. You guys are doing something right for sure. Keep it up"}
{"text":"Love the new downtown Chandler location! We have been to the Downtown Phoenix location and good to have one closer to us. Our faves are the Reuben and Banh Mi - very generous with the pork belly but I will have to remember next time to ask for no jalapenos, they are super spicy! 

The loaded tots seemed more baked than fried which made them pretty soggy so we sort of just picked at as a group. Everyone in our group liked their orders of the Mihami and Spang Chicken...cute space and the service was attentive and quick with our meals."}
{"text":"Awful service!! They need to do some training with their front of the house staff. Rude lady named April taking orders. She was condescending when I had basic questions. For being new to the neighborhood you would think they would welcome people inside their establishment. 

Food is overpriced and bland. Barely anyone inside the place. I hadn't heard anything positive but wanted to see for myself. Way better places to have a sandwich and salad at...don't waste your time on this one. I would rather go to any fast food joint than this place."}
{"text":"Just visited for the first time today- we have officially found our favorite sandwich shop. Had the Do Gouda and Pot Roast sandwiches and they were absolutely delicious! Ambience is also wonderful and our three year old was plenty entertained with the coloring and toys they provide for kiddos (and adults- husband and I had fun playing some games too)! Staff was friendly  and the mission of this business (partnering with 4 nonprofits around the Valley to donate food) is inspiring. We will be regulars!"}
{"text":"I had the stuffed French toast for breakfast (which is served all day). It was phenomenal!  There was so much fruit, I had to share with my husband. I am looking forward to my next visit. The coffee was also tasty but they do not serve decaf."}
{"text":"Ate there 2 weeks ago haven't been back i got the turkey sandwich with the cranberry jam and cucumber i asked for mustard on my sandwich when I but into it none  there menu clearly says pickle and chips when I open my bag no pickle chips aren't the bag kind there who made except the taste super stale and greasy i waited for 5 mins to be helped when place was emptya a manager was at the register  and a cashier there are to registers the other cashier is busy helping someone i go up to manager he looks at me says im not a cashier hell help you there are 2 registers"}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal! Exceeded my expectations leaps and bounds! I wanna eat the whole menu. I look forward to brunches here!!!

I had the jackfruit torta, and I was impressed. Even a friend of mine thought it was chicken! The salsa is house made and the avocado was very fresh. The owner was very sweet and I am super excited that he works with local businesses to help build his amazing menu. Like Peixoto coffee? They serve it. I love getting two good things in one place!. 

Overall, the atmosphere was super hip, they had a really wonderful DJ playing all my favorite classic hits of '90's! I would come back, I am already telling all my friends/coworkers/family members about. Guess a found a Bday brunch spot! thanks for having us!"}
{"text":"Been here twice in less than a week and both times I was more than satisfied.  Do Gouda and the Cubano were both delicious, can't wait to try the Reuben and pot roast dip.  Good bread is always the X factor for a great sandwich, and this place gets it right.  The meats here are high quality too.  Expect to spend about $11 for sandwich and a drink; well worth it, the sandwiches are big and delicious plus you get a pickle and chips or side salad.  Both times very friendly and well trained staff as well.  Blows every other sandwich shop in town away in my opinion."}
{"text":"Just tried this today for the first time..LOVE the atmosphere at this location..casual and comfy.. Food is fresh and delicious and not too pricey so I'm very happy about that. Staff was very friendly and accommodating.. I was not at all disappointed with my \"overachiever\" cookie that I got free just for checking in on yelp I will be back if I have the chance!"}
{"text":"Ordered the miami vice and was pleasantly surprised w/the taste & quality. The pork was super moist and tender. The potato chips were delicious. 

The vibe of the restaurant is casual and trendy. I love the board games to play while you wait for your food and the homesque furnishings w/comfy chairs and cushions. 

I would certainly come again if ever i happen to come through Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went for the first time in Tucson, then came again to this location three days later! Such a great atmosphere with delicious sandwiches, salads, and cookies (1 free with a yelp check-in). Also definitely planning on coming back on a Sunday to try the unlimited French toast for $3.75!!"}
{"text":"Even Stevens makes my panties wet!! Order the caprezey with goat cheese and siracha and the jp grilled cheese you won't be disappointed! This is my all time favorite sandwich place now above Cheba Hut by far!"}
{"text":"Came in here on a Sunday and really digged the open atmosphere and very relaxed coffee shop type vibe. The live music was okay and they had a great happy hour. We got party tots and a pulled pork sandwich and the Bahn Mi sandwich which was all very good. The tots were a little soggy but the quality of the sandwiches made up for them as did the decent prices. Will definitely come back some other time!"}
{"text":"Wow! Very impressed!! I was looking for a simple breakfast sandwich and was blown away. Took some driving around to find as it's behind the parking garage in Downtown Gilbert. We went early on Saturday morning. The place is very hipster and laid back. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with sausage and scrambled eggs. Wow this thing was massive! Two sausage patties and two layers of egg! On a perfect toasty brioche bun! Oh and it had maple syrup on it! To my surprise it came with tator tots. So good! Next time I want to try it with a medium cooked egg. 

Can't wait to go back and try other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Food was not good, nor was the service. Kids were manning the register and didn't seem to know what was going on. Portion size was large but other than that I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Everything is Super Fresh and I love the live music. Perfect Friday night spot with the family."}
{"text":"This is a neat place. Appears to be healthy as well. For every sandwich you buy they donate one to a local food bank. They also offer chips or salad with their sandwiches. I got the Spranger Chicken Sandwich with gluten free bread. It was was very good and filling. Their service was very good as well. One thing I'm not a fan of was how they have an option for tips. They turn the monitor over and have you choose no tip, 18%,20% or 25%. Felt awkward choosing no tip. I'm a big believer in tipping waiters not cooks and cashiers. If they want tips they can become a server. Servers make less than minimum wage and work hard to receive tips."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cubana and I was satisfied with it. Not the best or the worst sandwich I've had but it was good. Conveniently located in downtown Phoenix and overall a laid back atmosphere to eat at. Great service, clean establishment, and a good bite while on the run. Quick service, 4 star"}
{"text":"The menu looks awesome!  I love the vibe, and I will definitely go back.  I want to try their breakfasts. I had a bahn mahi.  The bread was perfection!  I thought the fish was a little salty, but I enjoyed the sandwich.  I also tried the mac and cheese.  Even though it had bacon in it (I do not usually eat pork), I had to try it!  Very rich!  

Michael the manager/owner was very friendly.  Staff was excellent.  I love that they serve Peixoto coffee.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and have loved it both times! First things first: 1) If you're a student, show them your ASU ID and get a free coffee. 2) Check-in and get your cookie. The oatmeal chocolate is delish, as is the frosted sugar cookie. 3) HOW COOL IS IT THAT THEY DONATE A MEAL FOR EACH SANDWICH YOU BUY?!!?! I can't get over that. 

Service: This place is on point with their service. The people are friendly and always have a smile and suggestion for what to get. They do a great job getting your food out to you on time, and making sure that everything is okay if you're eating in. 

Food: The Reuben is our go to. It's melty goodness on cumin-studded rye bread. The bacon is delightfully flavorful and the dressing pulls it all in together. It's served with either a side said (delicious), or chips (delicious, but too salty). It's a pretty greasy sandwich, so be prepared for that. Oh, and maybe schedule a workout in for that day. The pickles are yummy and free!

I've also tried the Turkeyday: the turkey is good, but the red pepper(?) jam isn't my favourite. I wish there was more cranberry flavour, and stuffing!!! Oh, and maybe some mashed potatoes. I'm really looking forward to Thanksgiving you guys. 

We bought our friend a Chicken and Beet salad, and it was a huge portion! The croutons were freshly made, and my friend said that even half of it was super filling.

Ambiance: Tons of seating available inside and on the patio. There's a strange retro-modern vibe happening. Not sure how they managed to make it work, but it does. 

I'll be back. Maybe every week. It's that good. I really want to try the brunch items and the small bites."}
{"text":"Amazing place, love how they serve breakfast throughout the day. The burrito I had and French toast were both incredibly good and not even that expensive which is great! Definitely will be going back and recommending this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"Even Stevens is new to the valley, and I hadn't heard of them prior to their AZ expansion.  After hearing about their cause (for every sandwich sold, they donate a sandwich/its fixings to charity), I was excited to give them my business. 

They have 3 dedicated vegan sandwiches, marked with a tomato icon on the menu. They have some salads which can be tweaked to be made vegan. The Brava Tots can be made vegan upon request (they'll just add vegan brava instead of the vegetarian brava sauce). 

They currently do not have any vegan desserts, but a PR rep and a chef informed me that a chocolatey vegan dessert will be coming soon. Yay!

At this location, I have had The New Morrissey three times. It has been different each time.  The first time was perfection: the wrap was toasted and warm, the perfect amount of veggies were added and it was delicious.  The next 2 times it wasn't toasted and didn't taste as amazing. One of the times they forgot the jalapeños and avocado/guacamole that I had added (and paid for), and there was an overload of carrots, which overpowered the other flavors.  The missing items were brought out a la carte after I mentioned they'd been forgotten. 

The tater tots are so good with the vegan garlic brava mixed with ketchup. Napoleon would approve.

The restaurant space is large and open. There is an outdoor patio area, which will be a hit when it warms up again.  The music here is banger! I end up dancing in my seat every single time I'm here. I suggested they host a karaoke night once a week or so; it'd be a hit!

They have one of those soda machines with the 101 flavor mix options (disclaimer: I do not know if there are actually 101 flavors, but there are a lot), and they have crushed ice here.

Being a downtown location, my only complaint is the darn parking.  They initially were validating parking at 100% of the cost, but something happened with the building management and the validation was reduced to a discount of like a few cents. This gave me major side eye, but it's not the restaurant's fault. I was informed that they are trying to rectify this.

Cool concept, friendly staff, yummy vegan options, and reasonably priced. I'm sure the cooks are still trying to get accustomed to the menu, so I expect that I'll be able to update to a 5-star review once the inconsistencies have been addressed."}
{"text":"I had been patiently awaiting the opening of this location and was super excited when they finally announced the grand opening date. 

I went for the pre-grand opening and I actually tried something new (Shocking; I know!): The Hummazing Vegan. I love hummus, but had avoided this dish at Even Stevens, thinking how amazing can an American hummus sandwich be? It was pretty darn rad. It's roasted red pepper hummus, roasted tomato spread, avocado, red onion, and arugula on toasted wheat bread. It also comes with cucumbers & tomatoes but as always, i omitted those. (If you hate the taste of tomatoes like I do, know that you're safe with the tomato spread.) Their sandwiches come with a choice of chips or a side salad.  For the first time, I got a side salad (lots of firsts that day!). It was a mixed greens salad with a vegan-friendly vinaigrette, and it was a healthy addition to my meal. 

They have one vegan dessert called The Pookie Pie (made by a vegan bakery in SLC). It's essentially a vegan chocolate whoopie pie: 2 large, soft cookie-cakes with a cream filling (think cookie sandwich, but softer). It's pretty good!

I find that the food here is filling, fresh, and a great value. Of course, I love their cause of donating food to the needy. This location's non-profit partners are St. Mary's Food Bank, A New Leaf - East Valley's Men Center, Boys & Girls Club of Greater Scottsdale, and Family Promise of Greater Phoenix.  

The Scottsdale Even Stevens is located in Old Town, east of N Scottsdale Rd, on the SW corner of E 4th Ave & N Winfield Scott Plaza (US Bank is across the street). The building is something called Mid-Century Modern (I seem to be the only person who has no idea what that means), which I translate to mean really cool looking, both inside and out. There are a couple of TVs inside, there's free wifi, a cozy back room, a soda machine that spits out crushed ice, and plenty of free parking.  What's not to love here?! 

I happened to witness something outside of the building, away from the cameras and customers (and I was sitting in my car, so they couldn't see me). A manager's interaction with an employee that was on such a human level: mutual respect and genuine caring.  The employee was leaving for the day and instead of a simple goodbye, the manager thanked that employee for everything that they'd done that day and there was an exchange of hugs. (Awww!) If their philanthropy model didn't prove anything, the way they treat their employees sure should!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice. I ordered The New Morrissey and the Jackfruit Torta. Both times were for carry out. I wasn't a big fan of the way they made their New Morrissey; it tastes better at their other location.  The Jackfruit Torta had a great taste and I like that they give you the messy/saucy parts in a separate container so that you may put it all together once you're ready to eat. This prevents you from having a soggy sandwich by the time you're ready to eat it. I would like to try the Jackfruit Torta while dining in to see if it tastes better that way.

Employees were very nice and friendly.  It's a large restaurant with ample seating. There is a parking lot and a garage, so there's plenty of free parking.  It's in downtown Gilbert, so it's a bit of a drive for me and anyone who lives west or north.

I do love the concept of giving food to charity with each purchase of a sandwich here.  There aren't a lot of vegan options in the east valley, so it's a solid choice for those who live, work, or just find themselves near Gilbert and in need of a solid vegan option. 

(They also have crushed ice for those of us who love our ice!)"}
{"text":"Even Stevens is rapidly growing in the valley, and this Arcadia location is the newest addition. Located on the NW corner of 40th & Indian School Rd, this brand new structure can be easily spotted from the road and has ample free parking. 

Employees and management are passionate about the food and their cause. Everyone was happy and eager to help. 

I got the Jackfruit Torta and added vegan aioli for extra flavor. This sandwich comes with jackfruit carnitas, pepitas, guacamole (however, I don't recall seeing guac on mine), salsa morita, radish, cilantro, lettuce, and pickled onions. It's served warm on what they call a sweet bun. This sandwich is delicious! I do suggest (insist) that you dine in with this one. Carry out doesn't do this torta justice. A pickle spear and your choice of either kettle chips or a salad is included with the price of their sandwiches. 

They plan to expand their vegan menu and vegan desserts are coming soon! 

This location partners with the following local non-profits: Joshua Tree Feeding Program, ICM Food & Clothing Bank, Friendly House, & Native American Connections."}
{"text":"This is a cool hang out of a restaurant right next to Clever Koi in Gilbert and I love it! Great vegan options that are meant to be vegan so no modifications needed, cool vibe, great meat options too, breakfast, and a good location next to the parking structure in downtown Gilbert. I'm happy.

Vegan options:
I had the Hummazing vegan sandwich and it really was hummazing. I got it with the chips, which were really yummy, but next time may go with the salad to see what they can do with some greens. \"Roasted red pepper hummus, slow roasted tomato spread, avocado, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, arugula, house vin, wheat ciabatta.\" Delicious. 

Other options I didn't try but will be back for;
1) Jackfruit torta 
2) The new morrissey breakfast burrito

Meat options are really yummy too. My mom got the Sprang Chicken. She REALLY liked it. 

We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Pretty bomb sandwiches but their soup sucks. They were a tiny bit overpriced and the atmosphere was trying a bit too hard to be what they wanted to be. But like I said, good sandwiches for sure. I enjoyed it, plus it's in a really good spot."}
{"text":"Although it has taken me a while to discover Even Stevens Sandwiches, I've completely made up for it with recent back to back visits! I tried the Salmon BLT on a Monday, asked to have it again on Saturday and ended up having breakfast burritos for Sunday brunch! Yes this was all in a week - that should tell you something! 

The sandwiches have so much flavor and provide a new creative spin on a traditional Sammie's! So far I've had the Salmon BLT, Jackfruit Torta and the New Morrissey! All were amazing! I'm a meat eater but these options were so appealing and well worth trying! I loved the Salmon BLT, around for limited time so try it! I even got it twice! The New Morrissey is also very flavorful and the sauce they provide makes it even better!

The inside dining area is very casual, clean and inviting, and the service is incredibly friendly and welcoming! Sometimes they play live music and there are board games for entertainment. Even Stevens also focuses on giving back which is just a plus plus to the already amazing venue!"}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place during one of my classes at ASU so, I thought I would check it out. The vibe in the place was very hip & modern. I'm usually not very particular about service, because I know stuff happens and sometimes people are just having a bad day. That being said, this was some of the worst service I have ever had. 

While I was deciding what to get, the guy at the counter was visibly impatient, despite the fact that I was the only one in line and I had only been looking over the menu for maybe 30 seconds. I asked him if I could make my own sandwich or customize one of the ones on the menu, as I didn't see anything that really caught my eye on the menu. He snobbily said a simple no and continued to tap his fingers and look around impatiently. I decided to just pick one of the sandwiches. The sandwiches came with a side salad. I asked him if I had any options with the salad, he said no and continued to tap his fingers and look around impatiently like I wasn't worth his time. After I ordered my sandwich, I told him I had a coupon from Yelp for a free cookie with the purchase of a sandwich, he looked dumbfounded, like I was saying the stupidest thing he had ever heard. I pulled up the coupon on my phone, which he than ripped out of my hands and starred at for a minute before, reluctantly asking me what kind of cookie I wanted. I asked him what kinds there were and he looked like he just wanted to leave and stop wasting his time with me, despite the fact there still no one behind me and I had only been at the counter for maybe 2 minutes now. He snobbily listed off the kinds of cookies they had. Once I had finished ordering, he shoved a number and a cookie in my face and walked away from the counter.

I was looking for a table to sit at, but all of them were dirty & sticky. I picked the cleanest one I could find and went to find some napkins to wipe it off with. I asked another guy where the napkins were because I wanted to wipe off my table, hoping he would get the hint and clean off the table, he didn't. He handed me some napkins and I wiped off the the table myself. The food itself was ok, however I didn't really have very many options to begin with. 

I think the fact that they donate a lot of their income to charities is great and all but, I will not be coming here ever again. The food is just ok and they give you know options to customize your order whatsoever. Not to mention the service was some of the worst I have ever had."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.   I have read about it and love the concept of them giving back to the community.   I also love to support any business with vegan options. 

I came in around 9:30 am on a Sunday for brunch and was excited to try the New Morrissey vegan burrito.   When I ordered they told me they were out of soyrizo but I ordered it anyway (there were no other vegan items on the brunch menu).

This is an order at the counter, get a number and find a seat kind of place.   It took a good 15 minutes before my mimosa came out.   It was another 10 before the food arrived and the place was pretty slow this early on a Sunday.    By the time the food came I had finished the mimosa and would have had to go back to the front counter to order a drink to have with my meal so I skipped it altogether.

The burrito itself was confusing.   I *think* it was supposed to be warm, but there was only one spot that contained warm ingredients- the rest was cold (as in refrigerated).  It tasted good and contained a great mix of veggies (sun dried tomato, carrot, zucchini, etc) but the small portion that was warm was WAY better than the rest of the cold burrito.  I would have asked the kitchen to throw it in the microwave for a couple of minutes but after the food was delivered I never saw an employee again.  

Also, I didn't detect any tofu at all in the burrito - it was just mixed veggies and tater tots.  

The final issue I had was that there was a table full of cleaning supplies and a dirty rag near the front door.   Think Windex, degreaser, etc.  The bottles sat there for about 25 minutes while an employee colored a sign at a nearby table.   After finishing the sign she finally gathered the chemicals and rag and took them into the kitchen.   For me, cleaning products and food don't mix so it was a pretty immediate turn off.  

Oh well.   Maybe I'll give Even Steven's another shot at a different location but in Arcadia there are definitely a lot of much better brunch options."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for a late lunch between 2-3pm.  There was one or her couple,  we ordered and seated ourselves.  I ordered the Cuban sandwic and a side of vegetables and my wife ordered a chicken salad.  Food cane quickly and we were both satisfied with the taste of our food.  Place is decorated nicely with a cool casual vibe.  We borh recommend this place"}
{"text":"Stopped by even Stevens to grab a quick sandwich before going to the airport.

All experience I had here was terrible. 

1. It's a sandwich place you don't want to wait 30 minutes for your food which is the time it took for me to get the food. 
2 I was facing away from the table and somehow they had put the food down behind me and I never heard them or saw them. The waiter claims that she told me as she was serving, but they have loud music playing in the background. Plus if the person hasn't even looked at their food for 5-10minutes wouldn't you check up on them?
3. Not knowing my food was served I went up to the cashier to ask to cancel my order because it had been 40 minutes since I had ordered and he had a very bad attitude. Blaming that I had my headphones in and didn't hear the waiter. I had one headphone in on the side of ear not facing the cashier/waiter. There was no apologies.
4. Food. 
I ordered a humus sandwich with tater tots and Brussels sprouts. You get 3 sauces with the tater toys and they were all bad. Tater tots themselves were crispy. Humus sandwich was a soggy mess. Flavors were okay. The Brussels sprouts was really bad. It was bathing in a pool of water/oil and not crispy at all. It was hard to chew. Not soft
5. One good experience is they have live music. Hence 2 stars.

I would NOT come back to even Stevens next time in back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Everything tastes really great! The best thing is they provide sandwich's those people in need. That's awesome!!!"}
{"text":"The place was pretty nice inside. The layout was a little funky. We ordered 2 sandwiches and tater tots. The sandwiches were ok. The tots were cold and really dry. We will be back to try something new."}
{"text":"Ordered the bomb mi with mahi: it was so slathered with mayo that I felt physically sick. I will never order that again. Just gross."}
{"text":"OMG! Best breakfast burrito I think I've ever had. And I'm a native Arizonan so I've had my share of burritos. Got the undergrad with sausage and then the standard fixings. Service was great, environment is fun and uplifting. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"The food alone, on its own merit, is absolutely delicious. That every sandwich you buy equates to Even Stevens donating an equivalent sandwhich in the name of charity, well, you just can't beat that. Eat good, feel good, do good. Go here now!"}
{"text":"The food and people here are amazing! There's always a great vibe and awesome atmosphere. Definitely a must!"}
{"text":"Wow, very good sandwiches found here! This has become a regular work lunch stop. Easily a top 5 sandwich stop in the entire valley(I know I haven't tried them all....but a lot of them ;).) You can't go wrong here. They have a varied selection of of sandwiches and everyone I've tried is super tasty. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"We stepped out of our comfort zone for this Sunday! 
Even Stevens was an amazing choice!!

Honestly, I was already was enamored with the place because of the website! It has a really interesting charm! 
The person who greeted us and worked with us, Bianca- she was amazing! Her relaxed personality really made us feel welcomed and eased any anxiety about the visit! 

The food was also fantastic for the price! The French toast was very tasty and the breakfast burrito was impressive! 
Definitely would go again!"}
{"text":"This place is legit! They have really tasty food, fair prices, and give back to the community.....so awesome! Their banh mi is insanely tasty with slow cooked pork belly as the meat and tons of fresh veggies..... I liked it so much, I asked for that same meat in a breakfast burrito....guys..... trust me...it's so good! Nothing like pork belly and tator tots mmmmm.  The portions are large and I always have leftovers. I can also get out of there easily under 10$. Complaints? Parking is a bit rough (not their fault, but a factor) and I think they may have changed their coffee....it used to be really good and the last time I went....not so much. Those are fairly minor issues though and I would 100% recommend you give this place your business."}
{"text":"Been to 2 locations and had the pot roast dip sandwich with sourdough bread and it was amazing. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"What I liked about this place was the atmosphere, any place that jams When in Rome is alright with me! It's a fun atmosphere, they have free wi-fi, plenty of tables including a patio, and the service is speedy and friendly! 

I have to give this 3 stars for the Hummus Vegan sandwich (no, I didn't ask for gluten-free!) I was disappointed...the sandwich was mostly bread and lacking in veggies. The Hummus and avocado were spread thin. Considering I walked out of my way to check this spot out, I was hoping for a stacked sandwich. The salad was a delicious choice with a house vinaigrette. 

Overall, great place to grab a bite, especially if you have studying to do!"}
{"text":"We went here for brunch with the family today. My kids who are 6 and o9 loved the decor and the ambiance. The place is really cool and has a very hip vibe to it. My kids occupied their time by playing Guess Who, the 1988 retro edition. 

The best part was really the food. My kids were happy with the macaroni and cheese with chips. Added bonus- a crisp pickle. My mom and I had the sandwich and soup which was also tasty and my hubby had a breakfast sandwich. The food was delicious and the was welcoming. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Came here for late breakfast around noon on a Saturday and was greeted with a short wait and a smile from the cashier. It's counter service so we ordered with her then easily found a table to sit and wait. 

The food was quick, hot, and super fresh. I ordered the undergrad bacon burrito and it was delicious and clearly made with quality ingredients.  Also had a mimosa that's $3 all the time, it was great for the price but I'd have paid more to have a reasonable amount of champagne. My friends ordered the french toast and vegan burrito options and everyone loved their meals and pretty much inhaled their plates. 

A really cool aspect of eating here is that for every meal you purchase they donate a meal to someone in need. I mean who doesn't like to get feed AND help an awesome cause?! Would definitely recommend to anyone in the Chandler area."}
{"text":"Great little spot in Downtown Chandler. Stopped in to check it out. Has a great atmosphere and menu. My daughter loved her pb&j, came with a nice bowl of fresh fruit. Looking forward to coming back and checking out the rest of the menu and maybe a mimosa"}
{"text":"Finally made it to one of their locations (Gilbert and Tempe as well) and I sure was impressed! 

You walk into a huge inviting space with super awesome decor and staff that are all smiles. I took a look over the menu and knew the Bahn Mahi was the one for me. Went with house made chips and a fountain drink for only $11, very happy with that! 

Meant to get a shot of the food, but as soon as it was brought to me I couldn't resist digging in! Tons of yummy grilled fish, all the flavors of a bahn mi, and a perfectly toasted bun made this one of the BEST I've had. So good. My mom got the wedge salad and loves it with avocado salsa, looked really good. Overall, great spot. Oh, and my friend who I sent in told me they have the BEST Rubuen he's ever had- so there's that too! 

Did I mention that by eating a sandwich there, they donate to a nonprofit to help feed someone in need? Eat to give!"}
{"text":"I could just leave these two words, excellent service. Completely blown away by these employees flawless and genuine service and personalities. The gentleman taking our order was knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendations. Of course, it's not hard when all the food is so good!! The ladies food running were so sweet and thoughtful, they brought a bowl of fruit for my baby to snack on! That is going above and beyond. 
Now the food. Best. Grilled cheese. Ever. (WARNING! Spice level is not for whips!) if you love heat, this is for you! 
The pot roast sand which was equally delicious and I think I could eat their bread every day. 
Heck, I could survive on their potato chips alone! 
Really loved the fun, fresh atmosphere! I could sit here all day! Loved the idea of board gamers to play, would definitely be a fun hang out with friends! 
Wonderful restaurant, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Different selection of sandwiches, I liked the things I tried so far, breakfast sandwich with avocado was the bomb and also the De Gouda was amazing, very testy"}
{"text":"My husbands first words were \"I'll never order a sandwich anywhere else!\" The service and food is amazing! We had the Oh Gouda and the Miami Vice and both were delicious! Can't wait for them to have beer!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The Rueben sandwich is one of, if not the best I have ever eaten! The Sloppy Joe has such a great flavor, especially with the slaw! The Pot Roast sandwich is the greatest creation ever! The Pot Roast is juicy and delicious, topped with a jalapeño jam and a nice, crunchy bun! The sandwich blends all those ingredients so beautifully and they play so well of one another perfectly! It's the greatest sandwich I have ever eaten! The baked Mac and Cheese is creamy and loaded with bacon! The staff is super friendly and so much fun to talk to! Plus, every purchase goes to a great cause! I will definitely be back! They are the #1 sandwich place in the valley! So happy that they are here! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We found this sandwich shop on Yelp on our way out of Scottsdale. The vibe and decor is onpoint! I wish there was an Even Stevens in California close to my hometown! I give this place a 5 star for the food, customer service and the decor!!! I can't wait to check out the new spot in San Diego when it opens! I got the Hummazing Vegan sandwich and it was one of the best I've ever had! Thanks for the amazing food and service!! Your attention to detail from A-Z was noticed and appreciated!"}
{"text":"Pretty neat joint! Went here for a Yelp event and learned all about their cause. I love how they donate a sandwich for every one they sell...that's pretty neat!

I had a vegan sandwich that was very awesome! It came with a side salad and this vinaigrette that was really good. The sandwich was freshly made on delicious bread that wasn't too hard but still stayed together. I wouldn't be surprised if the bread was made in house. 

If you go here, try the coffee! They get it from this coffee shop in Chandler and I guess the owner's family owns a coffee plantation in Brazil. Anyway, I guess the way they roast the coffee beans brings out the aural flavor...the coffee is full bodied and earthy...I drank two cups of it...it was super good. Oh, and even Stevens has Almond milk which is way cool. 

Definitely try his place if you're in the mood for an awesome sandwich."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch place - their combination of flavors for their sandwiches is unique and always delicious.  Have tried several things on their menu and have loved it all.  Recommend the French Dip and JP grilled cheese.  Friendly staff and good service and even live music on a Saturday night .  A portion of every sandwich sold goes to local charities - there is good rolling all throughout.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have never had a better sandwhich in my life! The Do Gouda was aaamazing! Also, try the peanut butter jelly cookie. The atmosphere was great as well. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So I took my family to Even Stevens for Sunday brunch because of all the good reviews on Yelp. It was a disappointing experience but I'm sure that with a few changes it could become a staple in the old town Gilbert restaurant scene.

First off as soon as you walk in you don't know whether to wait to be seated or to approach the register. The menu on the wall is so vague that I had to pick up a take out menu to get a better idea of what each item actually consists of. 

With that being said the food was hot, fresh, and savory. Now there were some more issues after getting our food. There was a hair on my sandwich- most likely because none of the cook staff was wearing hair nets. Multiple cooks had their hair down (Gross). The new Morrissey vegan burrito was a total letdown and they ran out of tots at 9:45am. How?  They are very short staffed so it took forever to get replacement meals made.  

They would also be better served by having caddies at each table for sugar, condiments, and napkins because I had to get up from the table MULTIPLE times for the smallest things and there isn't a dedicated waitstaff to help you. It would be nice to have that explained in the beginning.

Overall a good call concept with a lot of kinks.  The BEST part was the unlimited French toast for $4!"}
{"text":"I am a bit torn.    I only had a burrito and it was pretty darn good.  Anytime you throw some hash browns into.......most anything I am hooked. They do this with the breakfast burritos and I like it.  The negative is the creamy mystery addition that is likely sour cream and chipotle???  Anyway.  Good food.   They make you wait which is a positive as related to freshness."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I tried this place and I am very impressed. Very good sandwich places are hard to come by, but the sandwich I had is one of the best, if not the best sandwich I have eaten. What I liked, is the sandwich was not It all bread, rather loaded with ingredients. Not only is the sandwich delicious, but they also give back to the local community every time you buy a sandwich. I will returning to this place frequently."}
{"text":"Ordered the cubano for the first time today via Uber eats and over all it was great. 

Wasn't expecting a side salad, so that was a nice plus and filled my stomach a bit more. The sandwich itself was awesome - good size for a fatty like me and very meaty! My only (personal) opinion is that it could have used some more sauce or slaw or something, but it was still great and I'd order it again."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sandwich shop. I was in the area meeting a friend and this place popped up on my yelp search. My fellow Yelpers did not disappoint. I just hope they open one closer to my home. 

As I walked in, I almost thought it was a retail shop. They had shelves full of souvenirs for sale. The kitchen wasn't visible from the front, only two registers. They had many booths very comfortable with high backs...set up so you can hang out instead of eat and go. 

I ordered Mihami Vice, their version of Cuban sandwich. The bread was perfectly toasted with crunchy exterior and soft/warm in the middle. The meat/cheese/cucumber was in perfect harmony. I have to say it was the best Cuban sandwich i ever had. I didn't feel guilty eating it either as it didn't taste greasy. The side salad was nice and fresh with tasty dressing too. My friend had a turkey sandwich which she really enjoyed. 

I would love to eat here again; just have to make an excuse to drive out there."}
{"text":"Food was fat and delicious. Easy on the pocket book. Easy parking, walking distance to and from downtown Gilbert. Bathrooms clean, service friendly, facility was clean."}
{"text":"Went to the soft opening and had a very good time. Not your typical sandwich shop. Interesting eclectic selection of sandwiches with their own twist. Open seating and an interesting crowd. Staff was friendly and attentive and there to assist with any questions. The owner Michael was present and was very nice. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!!  Awesome business concept with donating to local non profits for every sandwich sold!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! My friends and I come here  a few times a week to grab lunch and study. We love how close it is to our ASU campus. The atmosphere is great, the food is amazing, and the staff is super friendly! I highly recommend this place if you're in the downtown Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"1,342,154 sandwiches has been donated so far!

There is no denying that their cause is AMAZING. When you eat, someone else gets to eat too!  But I gotta be honest and say that my sandwich on Wednesday night was not good.

Jackfruit Torta ($8.45 - Jackfruit carnitas, pepitas, guacamole, salsa morita, radishes, cilantro, lettuce, pickled onions, sweet buns) That torta was not doing it for me. From the meager serving of guacamole to the sour slaw, I didn't enjoy it. The slaw was so soggy from the salsa morita and the jackfruit carnita took on the pickled flavors from the onions. The overall texture was mushy.  I ended up sticking a veggie burger patty into my torta since I was at home. The lovely Tigra C. did say that the Jackfruit Torta is better when eaten in the store though so there's always that.

I also got an order of Party Tots to share. These were alright. I think they would have been better enjoyed hot from the fryer. 

All in all, Even Stevens is no doubt an amazing company with such a wonderful cause.  I've gotten to speak with them on a more personal level at a previous Yelp event and I love their cause!  3.5 stars easily. I'll update my review if I ever get around to eating in the restaurant.  I'm pretty sure they were just having an off night!"}
{"text":"Sandwich places have 4 levels:

1 - pre-made, like a gas station or grocery store (don't bother)
2 - fresh made at counter (Subway, Potbelly, Whichwich) the key there is not much TLC in the ingredients and construction, but acceptable and cheap
3 - fresh made AND some ingredient TLC, but still some suspect construction (bread:filling ratio off) and a few ingredients just tossed in - think a local Italian or Jewish deli with great meat but crap bread, or a bagel shop that also does sandwiches - good sometimes, but you know there is something more out there...

Level 4! That's when you get TLC in every ingredient and the construction is thought through. Questions are answered like 'What bread does this sandwich need for its level of moisture? What thickness of veggies are needed? Is there a proper crunch:goo element? Should the cheese be melted? Condiments included within, or is this a dipper?' As for construction, the sandwich should be well-distributed, but not perfect, though there should be a high probability of receiving the 'perfect bite.' Part of the charm of a sandwich is any bite may feature a certain ingredient that might have been overshadowed in other bites - it's constantly changing, but also consistent - an enigma!

That's what Mr. Steven did so well in conceptualizing my Cuban - melt-in-your-mouth pork, gooey cheese, sliced pickles (a wedge would have been too much), toasted bread - this sandwich lived up to the standard of a restaurant/chef-inspired meal. 

I also shared some party tots with my toddler - tots with nacho toppings, not as good a dish as I would have hoped - kinda sogged up after a while. They had games and toys for the kiddos, which was fun while we waited. 4 stars cuz I've only been once, but I'm sure I'll bump it up to 5 next time so go!"}
{"text":"Delicious blueberry salad- the granola on top was amazing!  Servers were friendly.  Food was a little pricy considering you order at the counter.   I would go again and use the check-in offer to get a free cookie!!"}
{"text":"I love the breakfast burrito, undergrad, medium eggs, tater totts on the side, with two orange juices. Friendly staff, quick service, nice interior. I will continue coming here."}
{"text":"I got a call this morning to come in to try this new place. Im glad I did the food is amazing! Well presented and delicious. Breakfast burrito is on point! The party tots are very unique and good as well. I made a custom drink lime sparkling water with cherry vanilla dr pepper. They were also passing out fresh baked cookies! Best morning ever :)"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing breakfast from this place. It's kind of a hip place to go to. The have a wide selection of food and provide breakfast all day. I like that when you buy a sandwich one gets donated. The breakfast burrito I had was really good I definitely want to try their other ones. The price range is really affordable especially for bigger families. They have all you can eat French toast on Sunday brunch for $4.75. That a price you can't beat."}
{"text":"Not sure what they hype is all about. My husband and I went here for lunch today and it wasn't anything to write home about. We upgraded for Mac n cheese and tots. Mac n cheese had NO flavor. Tots came not seasoned and with a sauce that was curdled and just looked unappetizing. Service was so-so. Not rude just didn't pay much attention. We probably won't be back. To many other places with much better food in downtown Gilbert. The atmosphere was cool though that's a plus."}
{"text":"Fantastic food along with fantastic service... plus they give back! What more could you ask for... oh wait cheap beer ... yep... they got that too!! Highly recommend;)

We had the Cuban sandwich and the Turkey pot roast sandwich and they were both amazing! The bread was so soft yet crunchy on the outside! The turkey blew our minds because it literally tasted like beef... sooo delicious! We also ordered the shishito peppers and those were just so so probably should have went for the pretzels instead... next time for sure!! They also have really great ice tea as well that taste so good and earthy! We can't wait to go back and have a few beers too! So happy to have you in Chandler... what a great edition!"}
{"text":"Worst vegan burrito I've ever had. I paid $8.00 for it and I wouldn't even pay 3. I couldn't even pick it up. The inside was 95% onions and carrots and maybe 3 pieces of tofu and non existent soyrizo. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Did I not order the right thing things? Was it because it was a Postmates order so they didn't really care what they put in the containers? 

First of all I ordered a breakfast burrito and apparently they were out of tortillas. So instead they called me, and we subbed a breakfast sandwich, which was supposed to have medium eggs. The eggs were completely well done when it arrived, and they decided to put a maple glaze on the sandwich even though I specifically said not to. Why? Because this sandwich had goat cheese, spinach, and avocado. Let me tell you that maple syrup mixed with goat cheese and avocado isn't the best. 

And can we talk about the brioche French toast that I ordered *with* pecans (by the way) and I paid extra for. What I got were three pieces of stale bread. There was no powdered sugar, no cinnamon, it was rubbery and there were no pecans.

The best thing I ate was the kids turkey and cheese. It was basic, with white bread mayonnaise lettuce and tomato. So congratulations on making a 5th grade lunch sandwich. It's pretty much the only thing that was edible. I have no idea what went wrong with this order, or at this location.

I paid 5.00 for the fee and 5.99 for the delivery. So overall I spent $11 extra for them to send me a whole disgusting mess. I really don't think it's cool that they give no thought to the orders that are there for pickup.

I'm normally not this person, but what a letdown."}
{"text":"YES, the sandwich is $10, but they do give one away for everyone sold..... it's worth it! And let me tell you...it's worth it. The atmosphere is exciting and vibrant, clean and music is jumpin! The food is T A S T Y crunchy soft yummy bread, crisp vegetables, soft flavorful meat, and the sneaky pickle on the side...don't forget that bad boy! The size is perfect for a girl who does not miss a meal. 
Down the hatch it went. 
Thank you for the tasty bits and you'll feel better for gobling because it's for charity. Wink*"}
{"text":"Saturday 8/5/2017. I stopped by to get 2 breakfast sandwiches around 8:30 am. Only one employee working at the cash register. She was very busy going over the entire menu telling the.customer in line in front of me every ingredients that were included in each item on the menu. Food was waiting on the shelf at the kitchen to be taken to customers who were already sitting. I stood in line too long for food that I think would have disappointed me. I'm done trying to eat at the restaurant."}
{"text":"You know those people that you're like, \"DUDE! Did we just become  best friends?!\" How about 6 of those moments within a 10 minute period. That is Even Stevens, ammarite? Yelp introduced them once before at a past event at the Unexpected Art Studio and we just loved the people working the booth. They somehow managed to fill the entire place with badass, like-minded people - boom. 

Okay, okay enough of the mushy stuff. The place itself is really cool inside - all about good food and giving back, love. The parking is ehm....lacking. I parked down the side street in a random lot and just hoofed it over. At least it's not in the ghetto. I got the sandwiches to go because my boyfriend and his buddy wanted to give it a try too. Bahn Belly, Sprang Chicken and a Rueben (because I missed the cool name boat). All of them were ah-mazing. Seriously, we didn't speak until it was gone. You can get chips or a side salad, we went chips fosho. 

Overall this place is the bombdiggity. If parking is a bit tough well damn, you're probably doing ok if that's the worst of your problems. 

Cheers to good food and good people!"}
{"text":"Great customer service!! Upon entrance to the when we left. The guy (mod) made sure wife n I enjoyed the sandwiches we had. Awesome knowing they give back too. For every sandwich purchased, they give one to one of their charitable partnerships to feed those in need."}
{"text":"The french toast was ok. It couldve been better. It was dirty this morning. Maybe they were busy. Walkway to bathroom was dirty too."}
{"text":"This is conveniently located on the corner of Arizona Ave and Boston.  I really like the space when you walk in- lots of room for people to order and a nice ambiance. The staff were quite friendly and courteous. I had the breakfast sandwich with maple bacon- delicious! What a nice presentation and it came with tater tots on the side for under $7.00. What a good deal!"}
{"text":"Ate here and loved the Do Gouda and party tots. Blt salad had chunks of pork belly. Delicious and staff was wonderful!! Would def come back and try more. Cute atmosphere with games available to take to table and play and hang out. For every sandwich sold a potion goes to a local charity which are listed on wall by cashier so you know where funds are going. Go check out!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and i really didn't think the menu was too suitable for a decent breakfast. But, we were wrong. We Loved the food. Pork belly was Off the CHAIN!!"}
{"text":"Super cool place!  First time here and I ordered the Do Gouda.  Delicious!  I have to try the brunch on Sunday, so I'll be back soon.  I love the concept!  Staff was awesome and super friendly!  Since it was my first time they explained the non-profit partners.     Considering trying the catering during the holidays!"}
{"text":"I get it, you are hip and trendy.  You have no uniform or cleanliness standards and it really shows.  The food was very disappointing for what you pay and the \"live entertainment\" was anything by entertaining."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times the food has been super yummy and the staff seem genuinely friendly! My ONLY request would be to have freshly brewed iced tea as an option."}
{"text":"Really cute decor. Had the kettles and queso which was delish, like a cheesy sloppy Joe dip. Do gouda sandwich was really great too, not small but not huge either. I was really excited about the smart coca cola soda fountain I love those things!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches! Friendly employees! Super cute vibe!! The Capreezy sandwich is incredible. Perfect blend of pesto, mozzarella, and tomatoes. My husband got the Jalapeño popper grilled cheese with steak added. It was delicious!! 

Definitely recommend this place! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The Peoria location is beautiful. Great space. I love the food and charity concept. Service is outstanding. The Turkey Dinner sandwich is my favorite so far. I will have to try some others. Their passion fruit ice tea is delish when they have it."}
{"text":"After picking him up from the airport, I brought my fiance and my daughter to try out Even Stevens.  I had an amazing sandwich during their media night (the grilled cheese was incredible) so I thought I'd spread the love.

The Tempe location is so cute and we LOVED that they had games to play.  We ended up playing the Guess Who game at our table for a few minutes.  They weren't too busy so we did not feel bad about camping out for a little bit.  They have really good games... even Rock 'em, Sock 'em Robots.  I don't think they thought out having the Game of Life there, though.  That game can take FOREVER and I doubt anyone really wants to wait on someone who is playing a full game.  It's one of my favs, but I didn't want to take up a table for that long.

The Good:

On this trip, I ordered the brioche french toast.  It was a bargain and was yummy... but it could have used a side of sliced strawberries or some fruit with it.  It just looked so lonely on the plate.  

My honey tried the Mi-hami sandwich, which is their version of a Cuban.  He devoured it in 4.5 seconds, which is pretty amazing considering this guy eats like 1/2 of my portions, even at 6'2\" and 2## pounds.  He left the chips, which was great because I have the tendency to rudely eat off his plate (which he doesn't mind).  

My darling daughter got the grilled cheese kids' meal, which was generous.  At $4.99, it definitely made the list for places to eat in the future.  She was happy that Even Stevens used real cheese and good bread.  She said it was \"delicious.\"  So, there's a raving review from one of the Tempe location's first 8 year old customers (I'm assuming).

The Bad:
We also ordered the party tots as an appetizer.  Before you get too excited, don't.  I love tater tots, but there was a lot to be desired.  For one, they just don't have enough cheese to be called a party.  Was there cheese?  I don't remember.  Plus, the flavors don't really mesh well.  They were like nachos, but the texture was weird and the tots tasted like they were under-seasoned.  To be fair, the dish normally comes with bacon and I asked for it without.  Perhaps the saltiness of the bacon makes up for the lack of seasoning.

That brings us to the customization.  Okay, so I am a pain in the rear and ordered something without bacon (which I know to some of you is sacrilegious).  Here is how the conversation went: 
ME: \"So what comes on the party tots?\"   
CASHIER: (lists ingredients)
ME: \"There's no bacon, right?\"
CASHIER: \"On the tots?  No.\"
ME: \"Okay good, because I don't eat pork.\"
Moments later... 
FOOD RUNNER: \"And here are your party tots...\"
ME: \"Is that bacon on those?\"
FOOD RUNNER: \"Yes, do you need me to have them remake it?\"
ME: \"Yes, please.  I'm sorry.\"
/scene

Even Stevens is super awesome about customer service.  All the employees seem to wear smiles.  I loved that when I sent back the party tots that they offered them to another table instead of tossing them.  I hate wasting food and that was great!  

They're new so maybe the particular cashier just didn't remember about the bacon, but when someone says something particular like \"I don't eat pork,\" if you are not 100% sure about the ingredients, you should probably stop and ask someone.  I happen to be very mistrusting about pork sneaking into my food, so I always double check.  Some people might have an allergy and so it is really a training issue.

The only other thing I do not like is that they ask for a tip at the register.  This is ALWAYS annoying to me.  I know more and more casual places do this because they use Square, but I hate it.  What if the service is awful?  And, as such, I tend to only tip 15% or 18% at the register when I typically tip a lot more because I just don't know how service will be.  

Overall Impression:
I really liked Even Stevens and I will bring my kiddo back for lunch some day when we are in the area."}
{"text":"I got excited about this place because they actually have gluten free bread, and not many places in the downtown Phoenix (or greater Phoenix area for that matter) do... but that excitement was short lived. And let me also add, I am not gluten free by choice - more like my body hates me.

I order my chicken sandwich on gluten free bread to go, walk back to my office several blocks away and take two bites before I realize that the bread on my sandwich matches the bread in the normal menu description, which is a red flag because one size does not fit all when it comes to gluten-less types. Sure enough, I call and they confirm that the gluten-free modifications were not made. They do offer to have another ready for me on the gluten free bread if I want to come back, however. So I walk all the way back, get a quick apology and exchange food for my new sandwich only to find a half thrown together sandwich that they could not take the extra two seconds to cut in half. 

I do not mean to complain, because the flavor of the food was good but if you have a gluten allergy, beware. Cheers to getting sick for the next several days!

 I even tipped on a to-go order. You'd think they'd at least try... :("}
{"text":"So yummy! When I heard that they give a sandwich for every sandwich they sell, I thought the prices would be through the roof but they aren't."}
{"text":"Just opened recently in a nice small plaza that is still growing. 

Ordered the Breakfast Sausage Sandwich and the Chicken Sandwich and as you check in to Yelp you get a free cookie and we choose the overachiever. 

Sandwiches were average size and a nice change of pace from  everyday burgers and pizza. They are good, the decor is a different mix of modern and homey feel.

The person at the cashier was not the most appealing person to be at the front and greeting people"}
{"text":"New Sandwich Shop on Rural close to Dutch Bros and next to Halal Guys. 

A little different setup where the cashier is in the front part of the restaurant and after you order they walk back at the window to retrieve your food and then bring it to your table.

I ordered the Mahami Vice Sandwich which has roast pork, ham, whole mustard, swiss, Pickle spears on a baguette. Decent amount of meat and the bread was crisp and crunchy. Overall the sandwich was good but did not knock my socks off.

Also had the Party Tots, a heap of tots piled with cheese, bacon and avocado slices which was a good amount of food and pretty good tasting. The only thing negative is they cook the tots on aluminum foil and the tots stick to that and at times cannot get them off.

The interior is different where there are sofas tables and sit where you can and get the free wifi.

Good sandwich and next time will try the breakfast or other sandwiches."}
{"text":"New favorite in Tempe!! Great service, staff is very kind and conversational, it's a place where I could really see myself becoming a regular. They accommodated my request for no bacon on the party tots with no problem, and the Morrissey burrito was AMAZING!! It's refreshing to find a place with a few nice vegan options here. The pricing is great, a plate of party tots the size of my head for less than five dollars!! I also appreciate that they give back so much to the community and list their service partners. Good deeds never tasted so delicious!! Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today while visiting Phoenix. 

Service- was great. The guy at the register who took our order was really cool and friendly. I think he was the manager. And the girls who brought our food were all really sweet too. 


The food was great. And the atmosphere is really fresh and modern.

My mom and I both got the chopped salad and it was really good. Super generous portion for a good price and they don't skimp on any of the toppings. Tasted really fresh. It was great. 

A few others in our group got the party tots and they all enjoyed those. 

Two others got different sandwiches and said they were both delicious. 

Would definitely recommend and might even stop by for lunch again before we leave!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is always friendly and helpful, and the sandwiches are amazing. The jackfruit torta is"}
{"text":"The french toast was good... I wasn't a fan of the menu found it a bit confusing and I'm also not a fan of ordering at the counter but the staff was very friendly and its a clean and mellow atmosphere."}
{"text":"We visited the downtown location and was pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious and the staff seemed nice. The major downfalls of our visit was that the sandwich I came here for was not available... and then the soup I wanted was out... and then they were out of soda cups. The establishment has some things to work on, but I enjoyed the grilled cheese that I ended up ordering very much. It has jalapeños inside which gives it a bit of spice. A salad is included and that was pretty average with just some greens, a couple tomatoes and I believe a type of balsamic dressing. I think you can opt for chips instead but I can't remember. I also ordered a side of Mac and cheese that had tomatoes and bacon in it, the bacon was really good, definitely freshly cooked and not bacon bits. The mac and cheese wasn't that good to me, I wouldn't order it again. My guest ordered the Brussels sprouts and those were tasty. They also ordered the capreezy sandwich and they enjoyed it very much. The staff was attentive and pleasant. They were apologetic for the missing menu items and lack of soda cups. Parking is difficult at this downtown location but if you come at a good time there are a couple meter  spots right out front. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Love this place always a great environment to sit and eat and have great conversations"}
{"text":"I love there vegan and vegetarian options which would typically merit a 4/5 but the consistency has been far off. Granted they we're both take out meals but vastly different from one another. I'll give it another shot but was disappointed."}
