{"text":"We've been visiting Cocoa for a long time now. The service is first rate. The place is elegantly decorated with everything neat and pleasant. And the food is excellent: fresh ingredients, creative menu, delicate seasoning. It's always a joy going to CocoaLatte."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch on a weekend and it was awesome. Food is reasonably priced and the menu has a pretty large selection of eats, from combination platters to waffles/crepes to more savoury items. Great coffees and teas as well. There is a little area of outdoor seating in the back which is nice. Service was quick and friendly. The place was buzzing with people chatting and enjoying their meals. Overall, I'd definitely return to this cozy little place! It also seems like a great place just to grab a coffee and snack."}
{"text":"I didn't even order anything so I can't speak to the quality of the food, but when the customer service is so terrible that leave before ordering anything there's a problem. The girls behind the counter were so rude and unwelcoming. I know I don't want to spend my money on a business that makes me feel like my patronage is unwelcome."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood spot.  They have delicious sandwiches, soups, desserts, and drinks.  My favourites: avocado BLT, nutella steamer, molten chocolate brownie.  And their pumpkin spice latte in fall is way better than the one at any of the coffee chains. Lovely natural light inside and friendly staff.  My only disappointment is not getting to sit in the front window spot if there's just two of us, but I grudgingly concede that it makes sense."}
{"text":"Great staff. Groovy atmosphere. Wonderful breakfast menu. The egg sandwich on chiabata was amazing. The Blueberry waffle was so light and very good."}
{"text":"Our go to neighbourhood cafe! My daughter loves it (it's kid friendly). They serve light lunches, brunches and tasty soups. I do appreciate the gluten free options. The staff is great too!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here because my friend wanted to try the Nutella latte, which was quite good.  I had a cappuccino and an almond croissant, which hit the spot!  They deliver it right to you.  I appreciate how friendly the staff were and they didn't hover or make us feel rushed.

My friend had a Nutella croissant as well (I guess she was feeling particularly hazelnutty that day!) and they do not cheap out on the filling!  Knowing my friend, I flagged down an employee and asked for extra napkins preemptively, which they were more than happy to provide.  It was messy, but then again, so is my friend.

Planning another trip back with my husband soon :)"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Ordered, paid with tip, sat down and had to ask for water.  Couldn't even get water myself as there were no cups left. Lots of staff working there that are doing????  On top of that, when I did get my sandwich..there was a hair in it and I showed it to one if the staff who initially asked me if I wanted the top half on my sandwich replaced..like I wanted the bottom half that had also touched the hair.  Can't say I've ever experienced this before and I mentioned it to the manager who acted like she was doing me a favor replacing the hairy half of my sandwich. Sorry this place is on the  no-go list for me."}
{"text":"Fabulous lattes and a nice breakfast and lunch menu. Friendly staff and lovely decor. Recommend for a sit down coffee/ breakfast or lunch as well as take away coffee!"}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee, wonderful staff, brilliant food and great atmosphere! What more could you want?! I will be coming back here"}
{"text":"Food and gelato are good, coffee is good. Like it a lot.  Only thing is that the some of the staff seem stressed out at times."}
{"text":"Gluten free almond crescents are really nice, as is the latte. Will defo be back!"}
{"text":"Service is very good, great sandwiches, cool neighbourhood meeting place."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  this place is amazing!!  From the moment you walk in you are overcome with the smell of Nutella and crepes!!!  A great spot for a coffee/latte date, meeting, lunch or breakfast!  If I lived in the area, this would be my spot!!

Lolly the manager is amazing!  Super friendly and positive and attentive to every detail.  Alice was great too.  I ordered a Nutella Latte with Almond Milk and she made an awesome one!!"}
{"text":"Haven't had much of the food here, so I can't speak to that. But I really do love their Nutella lattes (iced or regular). They seem to be popping up all over the city but the ones here are by far my favourite."}
{"text":"friendly atmosphere, great for families and moms with babies. unlike other area restaurants, strollers are welcome and there are plenty of high chairs. the owner is always in and very nice.
my favorite dish is the breakfast burrito but it's only available until 12 pm on weekdays. the vegan soup, lattes and waffles are also good. food is reliable but not adventurous. a great local find."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff, and the food is healthy and tasty. (Just beware the nutella lattes, which can be addictive.) The vibe is very family-friendly too, so it was nice to bring the little ones along."}
{"text":"Great omlette with chorizo and cheese. Worth going back to!"}
{"text":"A lovely first experience here! Will definitely be returning. Clean, visually appealing, attentive staff, a variety of seating and atmosphere (yes, a variable atmosphere, depending on where you sit), and the best part-- an extensive menu! Mouth-watering selections that make it hard to choose just one thing. I had the infamous Nutella latte. Worth every penny. I didn't order any food but could see them grilling (from scratch) fresh cut veggies for a beautiful grilled veggie wrap (served with soup, yum!) I doubt you will be disappointed with anything you purchase here. You pay for the whole experience. I love these independent cafes!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite neighbourhood spots. High quality, delicious brunch, sandwiches, soups and salads prepared with care, very friendly owner and staff, and they make their own house hot sauce... What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Great little place that has improved the neighbourhood after the St. Clair Ave. construction finally has finished. Well priced and delicious sandwiches and great coffee make this place pretty special. They also serve a small selection of gelato. Best thing is conbining gelato and coffee in one. If you live in the area you owe it to yourself to visit the nice people at CocoaLatte."}
{"text":"It's a cute little place that seems to be frequented by new mothers mostly. I couldn't believe all the baby strollers...wow. 
The prices are decent for baked goods and coffee, but the food is slightly pricey, but they do have a vegan selection, so...maybe that's why. 
The place is a good size but as it was totally packed it seemed a bit small. The staff is nice but they could use a little more seating, just that there's no room for it! 

Decent place, good for a lunch or a chat with someone, but not the type of cafe you'd go to do work on your laptop or read."}
{"text":"I've been here both for breakfast and lunch. They have a nice little patio out back where you can sit in the sun, and a four seater at the front of the restaurant where you can watch people walking by on St. Clair Ave. There are also some seats inside, but frankly, it's a little stuffy and loud. 

The service is always friendly, although it can be a bit slow. The food is delicious and fresh, just the right amount so that you're comfortably full, not stuffed and not still hungry.

For the non-dairy folks, you can get lattes with soy milk. You can also get milkshakes made from their selection of gelatos, something I'm definitely going to have to try next time. Mango gelato and soy milkshake? I say yes!"}
{"text":"Very good location and a great decor inside. The coffee was fine but the food was okay. Nothing too special. I got the breakfast tostada anThe bacon didn't seem well cooked and it just seemed put together quickly. Regardless, still enjoyed it."}
{"text":"A small rift in the lute, as P.G. Wodehouse would say.  I found CocoaLatte's basic breakfast unsatisfying.  Was there too little butter on the toast?  Was the breakfast too small?  Were the slices of chorizo simply not doing it for me?  Maybe it was all those things.  Nice and light, but not the experience I'm looking for on a lazy Saturday morning.

I mean, there's no getting around it; the portions are small. There!  I said it!  The prices are still very reasonable, the food is fresh and lovely, if not overseasoned, and the service is wonderful.  However, you can drop in for a sandwich midafternoon without much worry about spoiling your dinner.  This is probably a good thing - big portions are unhealthy and can be downright gross.  However, it does feel a bit Spartan if I show up hungry.

Still a lovely place!  I'm looking forward to dropping in for an afternoon snack and a cup soon."}
{"text":"The food here is quick to the table,  hot and great tasting. They did accidently mess up my order, but she was quick to appologise and bring me a new one with no hassle. I ordered the chicken BLT wrap, and brownie with gelato. They had multiple gluten free options: any of the sandwiches can be made on a gluten free wrap, and their daily soups are gluten free. Don't forget the warm fudge brownie (you guessed it,  also gf!) And there are crepes and waffles for those without dietary restrictions. 100% will return in the future and maybe try out breakfast."}
{"text":"I only ordered a chocolate milkshake and got what seems like slightly thick chocolate milk instead. How can you mess up a milkshake?? I was only in the area waiting for someone, so I thought I'd find a spot to have a drink and read a little but I regretted my choice pretty quickly. The place is also quite loud as there are a lot of children running around. Additionally, there seems to be no ventilation and I walked out of there with my clothes smelling like food. I don't live in the area so I most likely won't be returning but even if I did, I probably still wouldn't. There are better spots on Saint-Clair."}
{"text":"This place has potential but is not quite doing it for me yet. This is unfortunate because their coffee and espresso are great but a few things are lacking:

1. No wifi. I get that cafes don't want to attract laptop lurkers but they could set a limit if that is their concern. Why not fill up your cafe during the day when most people are at work anyway...?

2. Flies. I took my mom there for brunch a while back and these flies just kept circling our table. Not fun when you are trying to enjoy your meal.

3. Service. Yes, the staff is friendly. They might even be overly friendly. BUT, one of the owners (I think) tries to up-sell me all the time. Crazy for a coffee shop! I just want my coffee. If I want to have a cookie or come back for dinner, I will make that decision.

That is really it for negatives. They have a nice back patio for the summer and one big bright table at the front of the cafe. Never tried their gelato but apparently it is homemade so that is a plus. Thus far, CocoaLatte is just A-OK."}
{"text":"This place was such a letdown which is too bad since it's in my neighborhood.

First, I don't want or need table service if I'm just ordering a $3 cup of coffee. (Not to mention the coffee was a little disappointing). 

Second, there are waaaaay too many things on the menu.  Is this cafe or a Mexican restaurant?

Third, why limit the free wi-fi to a few hours during weekdays? Seriously, get with the times.

One positive was that the staff were really pleasant, but I found this place way too fussy for my liking."}
{"text":"I love this place. I go often either to din in with my 7 month old or pick up a drink and muffin for when I'm out for a stroller walk with him. They are very accommodating and baby friendly (family friendly). On the weekends it is busy with lots of kids and families so be warned it can be loud with the blender, coffee maker, and lots of talking. Not so loud to be unpleasant though - just loud in a bustling Saturday morning kinda of way. It is small enough that it doesn't get so loud you can't easily talk to the people at your table. Food is always fast and hot! They have the very best hot chocolate - try it with almond milk! The sandwiches are delicious and they have a daily soup which I get along side my sandwich. Last time I was there it was a smokey corn chowder - so yummy. You can buy them in jars to take home. I like the chicken Club - bun is fresh and soft yet toasted. I don't think they bake the bread in house but it must come from a local bakery as it is always so fresh tasting. The chicken club sandwhich has a sizeable chicken breast with smokey bacon, lettuce, avocado etc. Simple but delicious! The rustic prosciutto is my other favourite a little less filling but so good! It has a drizzle of olive oil and rosemary that totally elevates it. This is my go to place when friends visit and we want a cute local lunch/brunch spot. Options include lots of healthy choices as well as some indulgences! Good for just coffee and tea too!"}
{"text":"Ordered an egg wrap with bacon. A little pricey but huge size and tasted great. Also ate at the little patio in the back which was a cool place to have a bite."}
{"text":"Great little find - fresh tasty food - quick and easy.  Friendly, personalized service.  Find their hours very strange and as a result have walked by many times only to find they aren't open.  Good little cafe to have on the strip and worth stopping in if you need a lite bite.  In the summer their back patio is cute...."}
{"text":"Wife and I went there for brunch and got kicked out cause my wife had a Starbucks coffee on the coffee holder of the stroller. Did not even get a chance to mention that the cup was empty and the server did not want to hear it.  Will not recommend this to any of my friends with strollers with coffee cup holders. I give them two stars cause my son and I went there one morning and it was good and fairly priced."}
{"text":"Simple delicious food for reasonable prices. I had the chicken wrap and salad for $12 and it was yummy. I added the salsa for $1.50 and it was worth it. The table by the front seems to be the only place for a stroller but considering how narrow the place is I am just glad it fit!"}
{"text":"Really cute little cafe. Great for grabbing a coffee or an ice cream, and the breakfast is nice, too, but the portions are so tiny! I ordered a breakfast special purported to come with 4 strips of bacon - it was actually two of the thinnest strips of bacon I had ever seen, cut in half to make 4. Seemed a bit of a bait and switch."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to check this place out after the cute play on words and the fact that it had the highest rating of the options in the area. On first glance, this place would appear to be out of place on this St. Clair strip, you'd place it more in the Bloor or Queen St. area of the city. But why should us \"Northerners\" not have a cute little cafe to go to?

For a Sunday brunch, there was no line up and we were seated immediately; however, we were definitely not the only ones in there. We were greeted immediately and promptly provided menus. Very impressive and they have found very interesting things to do with Nutella.

I decided on the Nutella latte, with a single shot of espresso. Very delicious! My only complaint is that you have to stir it frequently otherwise it all collects at the bottom. But when mixed, there are little flakes of hazelnut with every sip. Yummy!

I ordered the veggie omelet and it had a good portion of vegetables and was cooked perfectly! The accompanying salad was delicious; however, I could make the exact same salad at home so it's nothing special. 

The servers are enthusiastic about the products they offer and very knowledgeable about the selection. I got a couple of baked goods to go which I look forward to trying tomorrow.

All in all. I would definitely recommend this place to people who were in the area or were wanting to try somewhere different. I will also probably return next time I have a craving for a warm drink that has nutella flavoring (which thanks to CocoaLatte will probably be in the near future). Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, I got the \"tostada\". Skip the chorizo, per my recommendation. Friend got the early start, came with a side salad--perfect! Awesome dressing too. Got the soup, which was roasted cauliflower. Superb. Great service, just three ladies working, very efficient and friendly. They have a tiny bit of time to chat, and I'm amazed that they can be friendly and get so much work done. The secret: they like their job, and they care about their customers. Stereo is not too loud. Oh, get a latte too; I did, great job! They don't forget anything you've ordered."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee and breakfast! Cute little patio tucked away is perfect start to the weekend!"}
{"text":"I can only comment on their cocoa latte.. It was so delicious. It was coffee with a hint of mocha. Wish I lived closer to enjoy their latte."}
{"text":"I love Cocoalatte and enjoy chatting with the owners.   There hasn't been a soup I didn't enjoy, but I think I order the soup just for the yummy rosemary breadsticks.   Avocado salads and smoothies are a hit.  And when I'm in the mood for something sweet the vegan muffins are super tasty, they will even heat them up for you.   Their soy lattes are really delish which I enjoy every time I come in to do work on my laptop.   It's a cozy cafe I enjoy bringing my friends to."}
{"text":"I got takeout from CocoaLatte, so can only speak to the food. Would definitely like to go and check out the service and ambiance of the restaurant.

I saw multiple items on the menu that sounded great, and ended up ordering the Breakfast Waffle ($12) with strawberries, bananas, blueberries and a side of maple syrup. The fruit really won me over with this meal. I find that fruit is so often an afterthought at restaurants, but at CocoaLatte it was all really fresh. The blueberries especially were crisp and not at all mushy or gross. 

A friend ordered the Breakfast Sandwich, with two fried eggs, bacon, cheddar cheese, tomato and mayo. At $7, this is an amazing deal and was super delicious. I would probably get that next time."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. I've been here numerous times for food and coffee. The food is great and the coffee is always on point. The owners of this place happen to be the most down to earth people and are always engaging with each customer. This is a stclair west classic and people in the area know that this place has high quality food. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"One of my go to brunch places! Love the back patio in the summer, and the avocado tostada is amazing! It's family friendly, as there are always strollers and kids. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying their espresso here. Today I got their double americano, my signature drink. While various other coffee establishments price their items differently. I was disappointed. The espresso tasted weak, based on other places I have gone and it came to over 3 bucks. That, to me is quite an expensive charge on a double americano, considering too I brought my own take away mug. No discount? It would be worth checking out another time. 

The service is lovely and the food, from what I have read on the menu, does seem like it would be delicious; however, I have yet to try any food item. 

As for the vegan goodies, I know them well. After all the majority, if not all their vegan baked treats are supplied by the best vegan bakery in and around the Toronto area- Sweets from the Earth. All of their products, especially their vegan carrot cake is worth trying. They have perfected the faux \"cream cheese\" icing. It doesn't even taste like soy, but it is. 

As for Cocoalatte, I would try it another time, but to be honest. given the specialty coffee-shop status and the lack of others in the neighbourhood, it is bound to be expensive."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review on this spot. It's me and my 3 year old daughters favorite. The owners are a beautiful couple who are always so welcoming and friendly. Our visits there are always pleasant and it's an amazing atmosphere for a special, simply night out. 

Their food and treats are always served beautifully and are delicious. I'm in love with the rustic prosciutto sand which and both their salads (and I am in no way a salad girl). 

Overall a great place and one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"I went yesterday for breakky with my mom, n it was super amazing! 
I had breakfast tostada (bread was fresh, crispy yet u can cut thru it easy) cheese was melted on top of the fried egg n topped with lovely salsa. Nutella latte wasnt too sweet! 
Mami had cheese omelette with salad n toast n fresh orange juice. 
Food was delicious n fresh! Service was fast n servers were friendly. The bill was reasonable. I will def come back!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review from the quaint little back patio at Cocoalatte after baking in the sun all day at Salsa on St. Clair. What a gem this place is as the Bathurst and St.Clair area is lacking in breakfast/coffee shops with that cozy yet downtown feel. To drink, I'm having their signature Iced Cocoalatte which is basically an iced mocha that puts Starbucks to shame and to eat I'm having a delicious Avocado salad. It's a bit pricy but they definitely don't skimp on the avocado. 

The staff here is extremely friendly and accommodating. I was going to get my salad to go because I had my pug, Esther waiting outside - but they said I could bring her through to the back patio and eat with her there.

Also - I love the patio! It's very tiny with 5 tables. Christmas lights for the evening and a large tree growing right in the middle. There is also the option to sit in the sun or under a shaded overhang. The sliding glass doors into the restaurant make me feel like I'm sitting in a friend's personal backyard. Very cozy. 

Whenever I socialize, I always spare my friends the trip all the way up here and meet them downtown, but now I finally have a reason to ask them to visit me up here for a change. I can't wait to come back for a Sunday brunch.

*update* I just want to add; as I'm sitting here writing this, the very nice male server brought out a bowl of fresh water for my puppy!"}
{"text":"I met an out of town a friend here on Family Day monday so it was probably more crowded than usual. Despite my aversion for crowds I found the experience pleasant and would definitely return. My breakfast bagel was well-made and tasty; a good balance of egg, bacon, tomato and toast. I just wish it was bigger. My americano was also enjoyable but also wished it was a bit bigger.  Maybe I was just especially hungry that day.  

A great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I love CocoaLatte! What a cute little cafe! What a cute name!

Drop by for a Sunday lunch/brunch on a sunny day. The restaurant is quite busy but we have no problem to find a table either inside or outside at the patio.

We order the Breakfast Burrito and a Tuna Sandwich Melt with Beet soup. The ingredients they used here are nice and fresh. You can even watch them preparing in their small open kitchen area.

Though the portion is smaller but I think it is perfect for a nice quick meal without overeating. At least I feel like I have a healthy meal when I eat here.

The Chai Latte and Cafe Lattee where both nicely made.. The only thing I don't understand why the Chai Latte is served in a paper cup and half of that is milk foam?

The waitstaffs here are all so friendly and upbeat with such positive attitude.

I will definitely be back and have a coffee when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Good food quality and service.  Prices are very reasonable, likely they can do it because portions are small.  I got one piece of toast (ie. should be two) with my omelette.  Charged full price for a coffee refill, there should be one free refill if you are eating an \"entree\".
I'd go back, but just keep the above in mind."}
{"text":"Adorable cafe with a lovely patio. Gluten-free and vegan options, and the staff are pretty knowledgable about ingredients. Delicious soy-chai latte. Points off for insubstantial vegan options. The wrap is a tortilla and grilled veggies. It needs avocado or hummus or something to give it some staying power. Otherwise, a great place to work or study."}
{"text":"This cafe feels family run and approachable. Their crepes are tasty, delicious coffee and nice homemade soups (I've had the cauliflower soup a few times, always good). I think they also bring in their baked goods from local sources like wychwood baker.  My boyfriend and I will keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing brunch here. This cute cafe was pretty busy but well worth the wait.  They were super sweet and made pancakes as a special order.  The avocado sandwich was pretty good but messy to eat. I needed a knife and fork.  The fruit used was nice and fresh and they give pure maple syrup (not the fake stuff). I was really happy with the service and we didn't mind waiting for the food as long as it was made right. You can tell they take pride in the food they make. I was also surprised to see quite a few vegetarian options for the brunch. Definitely recommend and will be going back."}
