{"text":"My fish and fries were cold. The service was outstanding. The atmosphere is great.  The waitress wast attentive.  Unfortunately, I won't come back. I gave this  3 stars because of service and not the food."}
{"text":"Not sure how they got a 4 star rating. They did not have all of the ingredients for their combo plate. The food was truly tasteless when it arrived. Even the frys were soggy. How can you screw up french fries.  Very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"A couple of snowbirds back in FH for the winter, love the Taphouse and so happy to see they are now serving breakfast! Friday night prime rib is back or friday night all you can eat fish & chips, both are excellent at a reasonable price. Breakfast for $3.99 is also an excellent choice, 9am to 1pm on weekends or 10:30am to 1pm on weekdays. Lots of option's, great atmosphere, friday nights get busy so plan to go early."}
{"text":"Had a good experience tonight. Apparently they had on there A guys. Last visit not so much. The two young white guys busting ass tonight deserve credit. Last time there was a old timer and a younger Pisa working the food end of the operation. These fellas tonight put those guys to shame. Everything was on point , happy I came back a second time to try this place out."}
{"text":"I HATE to leave negative reviews, So I'll just leave the facts: Over the past 15 years I've been to this place a couple dozen times. Basically a sports bar with decent food with a menu that's changed  as much.  We went there with the expectations of sports bar food with sports bar prices.  So this is a price check review, NOT a food review.  Salad.....$13 Chicken Wings $13 Hamburger...$14 The menu reminded me of room service at a hotel; \"We've got you here, and now you're gonna pay!!\"  Sorry, we won't be going back until they decide to become competitive. Talked with friends that went there on a separate occasion; they feel the same.  Bummer, cause we like to support Fountain Hills businesses."}
{"text":"Unfortunately not enough people had a chance to give this place a genuine review. We were here with a group of friends on a Friday night around 8:30pm or so. We came here for dinner and drinks. Waitress seated us and took our drink order. Started off with giving me my wrong beer. She was nice though. Took it back without hesitation to get the right beer replaced. At this point we also went ahead and put in our order. I ordered their Tap House Burger. I wanted medium well done. It literally took them 1 hour to bring our food out. Somehow the chef forgot to make my burger. The waitress told me that the burger was not made and asked if I still wanted to eat or no? I was like, what kind of question is that? I was hungry and I came here to eat. So she apologized and asked the chef to make it for me. Another 10 mins went by and the waitress finally brought out the burger. I took a bite off of it and it was raw. The meat was absolutely soggy and cold. I stopped and cut the burger in half. The meat was definitely raw. The middle part was still frozen. The waitress saw that I was showing the burger to my friends and she came up and apologized. She took my plate away and told me I wasn't going to get charge for it.  One of my friends was given sour over due vegetables. The other group with us bought chips and salsa. Whoever made the salsa there basically threw a nasty chopped up whole tomato into the salsa and was served like that to them. Our pretzel was hard and appears like it has been sitting all day. Experience at tap house was by far the worst I've witness. I think their kitchen has a real problem. The waitress was nice enough to acknowledge it. I will absolutely not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We stopped here as part of our vacation when looking for a quick, easy bite. I had the buffalo chicken sub, one of my favorites, and this one was more than adequate, served with a generous portion of fries. My companion had the taco salad and rated it as average, not bad but nothing special either.   The draft beers we had were disappointing, though. Mine was flat and hers 'definitely wasn't fresh'.  For a place billing itself as a taphouse, that's not acceptable."}
{"text":"Really, really, really! The cooks here are so proud of their work -- and always strive hard to offer great food. The salads are fresh, amazing and delicious. The subs are about the best I've ever had.The menu is filled with good things to eat. This is definitely not \"bar food.\" Friday night fish fry is great and Sunday fried chicken dinner at about $6.99 is an unbelievable deal. Check for live music and no cover charge!"}
{"text":"Same as #6 Tap House on mobile app."}
{"text":"Tried it out after hearing how it was under new management and more family friendly. Went during happy hour and found that the happy hour menu was eliminated and the drinks were no bargain. See no reason to return."}
{"text":"The place was busy but not beyond control decent one room bar. We sat at a table near the door and had no acknoledgement for 10 minutes so we decided to go sit at the bar. Bartender was friendly and attentive. The grill was right there next to the bar and you could watch everything. The main cook did nothing to help a persons appetite unless you were looking for a reason NOT to eat. Scary! They were only serving cornbeef & cabbage for St. Paddy's so we didn't eat. The really good thing about the place is they serve Corona light on tap AND they also serve Mikes hard lemonade on tap..... Large glasses for less then $5.00 each. Really cool!!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say. This place has potential but for me they missed the mark.   I had a \"green chile\" cheeseburger which would have been fantastic. The chile itself was super flavorful. That's something I haven't been able to say about many places in Arizona so it really bummed me out that my burger wasn't cooked to my request.   I know people don't agree with this and that's fine. But for me?  Ground mystery beef anywhere, I want it cooked!  Well done!  Every time!  When I bite into it and its greasy and bleeds?  That's no Bueno and the main reason I only give 3 stars.   The bartender was great, the atmosphere just as you'd expect for a bar and I had a really good beer.   I'll be back and will update as necessary!    It would have been the best burger I've had in fountain hills but I can't give more stars because on this particular instance, my order wasn't prepared per my order."}
{"text":"Loved The Tap House having Tommy Holloway there last night.  He is brilliant and the customers love local talent.  The best time we have ever had there.  The food was much improved, service great and we sincerely hope they will have Tommy as a regular.  Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"OK, They got me! I have been in the place three days in a row and each time it has gotten better. The thing I love and won't forget is the owners brought in Dogfish IPA just because I asked, customer service doesn't get better than that. Now my favorite hang out. I had the turkey ruben for lunch and it was really good and the service was top notch. Great patio and now my favorite beer!!"}
{"text":"Took a good friend to see the Browndog Blues Band last Sat. night and had a great time. The band was amazing.The menu was much larger than I anticipated but I wanted to try their famous hamburgers. We split the Spicy Burger w/ house cut fries. WOW.... it was one of the best burgers I can remember. We ordered it cooked medium and it was just perfect. Not too spicy but succulent delicious. If I was more hungry I could have eaten the whole large thick burger myself. As for the famous house cut fries, they were average and greasy. Think the fat was not up to the correct temp to seal them so they soaked up a lot of grease.. We also had a side salad that was very good. For a very busy Sat. night and only 2 servers, the service was very good. A nice clean place with lots of items on the menu. Very friendly and warm. I shall return.."}
{"text":"We love the tap house.  Staff and food are great  you need to try the new chief out awsome five star quality food"}
{"text":"Best burger in Fountain Hills... hands down!!! The \"tap house burger\" is something else, 1/2 lb 100% angus beef patty with sliced prime rib on top with grilled onions and cheese  AMAZING.  Not to mention they have 23 beers on tap featuring a wide variety of local brews. Your missing out if you haven't been to this place.."}
{"text":"Cold beer but the food was no bueno.  Hot wings were good sized but not cooked all of the way. The sauce was not very appealing either, it had more of a peppery or picante spice vs a Buffalo style sauce.  We had the nachos too and they were well portioned but pretty bland. Instead of a carne asada or flank steak they served it with ground beef which isn't necessarily bad, but it had no seasoning.  They have a good beer selection, so that gives them a couple stars."}
{"text":"I love this place! Friday night fish fry and believe it or not the best margaritas! I'll be a Friday night regular!"}
{"text":"We are now regulars at the Tap House because of the good food and neighborhood atmosphere. Now we have another reason to go.. Every other Friday an amazing entertainer and creates a Vegas Dinner Show  that is second to none. Dave Karl has an amazing voice and if you like hearing: Frank Sinatra, Kenny Rogers, Neil Diamond songs this is the pace to come! If you close your eyes you think you are at a Dinner Club in Vegas - his voice is better than the original singers! We we so surprised! What an enjoyable evening. We will be there every other Friday!   Friday night is all you can eat Prime Rib and Fish Fry. The Prime Rib was delish! The salad was even better. Best burgers on  the planet. They also have TV's all around so you won't miss any sports on TV. Great friendly service.  It is the most affordable evening  out and the most enjoyable. Please don't miss out on the local Gem!"}
{"text":"In a town full of limited choices I would regulate my regulars better.  I came in two days in a row and the same couple was at the bar getting loaded.  They were absolute human pigs.  They treated the staff and other customers without any respect.  However I did stay 2 hours longer to see what they did next.  It was like being at the zoo.  I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"First time here and we really enjoyed it, It is nicer on the inside then it looks on the outside.  The service was great, atmosphere was nice, several TVs, prices were pretty decent (bloody Mary's only $3 on Sunday, and they actually put alcohol in them)  Food was good...not great, but typical bar food.  The guys gave the burgers 7 out of 10.  We ordered extra crispy fries and they really were extra crispy!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on wednesday ,burgers were great!  Service was also very good"}
{"text":"When to Fountain Hills to see the fountain and discovered it only \"fountains\" on the hour for 15 minutesr. Needless to say we missed it. Decided to have a late lunch and my backseat driver saw The Taphouse and asked to stop there. Sure glad we did. The 4 of us had the best late lunch of the year. Two perfect and best ever Patty Melts, a great Deep Fried Cod and a burger that was as gourmet as any burger I have had.  The beer was cold, the waiter Diane V warm and friendly and the food good enough that we are planning on bringing all our out of state visitors up here for lunch and next time we will catch the fountain."}
{"text":"Great little bar. Food is good. Drinks are good. Service is great. Nice place to socialize in an out of the way spot."}
{"text":"The closed down for a few days, revamped their menu and I believe I read the needed to get new coolers installed too. New menu, looks like they're really pushing their burger menu (that's where the biggest selection was). I should have taken the hint and given the burger a chance. Instead, I ordered the BBQ pork sandwich - as I recall, they refer tonit as the ultimate. It comes with pickled onions, I opted out of that, I'm a Southern girl and you just don't do onions on a good BBQ sammich.  Anyway, the BBQ was 'meh. Their fries weren't good as I remembered them. I asked for a side of cole slaw, also a disappointment.  I was hoping when they upgraded their coolers that they were also going to upgrade their draft cooling system. They didn't, so their draft beer still isn't quite as cool as it should be.  My coveted Turkey Reuben is no longer on their menu. :/"}
{"text":"My friend eats here at least once a week and said the burgers are great. He was absolutely right. He swears by the Bacon and Blue Burger that's not on the menu. Ask for it and maybe they will make it for you and include it in the future. I would have gotten it, but my didn't mention it til I was done eating. I'm getting it on my next visit.      I had the Spicy burger with green chili's and jalapeno's with a Chipolte Mayo. It's not to spicy, but if you want milder they make one with just the chili's. Much milder. My friend had this one and said he could have eaten another.      As for the burger patty itself, it was thick and grilled a perfect medium. I was in heaven. I opted for the onion rings. Some of the best I've had in months and months. Crunchy and tasty.      My son went with the Honey Hot wings. Those disappeared fast. They don't bread theirs which makes them a little better for the healthy minded.      They have a good selection of beer and a full bar. The staff was friendly if a bit slow at the bar. But once we had them working on our food, it was up quick.      It's by far one of the best places I've eaten at in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"The wallete and sweet bourbon sauce, the seasoning has a touch of salty balanced with a sweet bourbon and a splash of fresh veggies to create a fantastic flavor. Kudos to the cook who put this together. Even the presentation was excellent. This place is moving in the right direction"}
{"text":"Best burgers in FH, drinks reasonable, bar food, home made potato chips. Staff friendly. Wish they stayed open later"}
{"text":"Food was good. The waitress was chewing gum like she was giving it a good work out. Even while she was taking our order her jaws were giving that gum a work out. Not very professional. The cook came out to see if we liked our meal and we said yes. It was Monday night and the place was empty. Not sure why, it can't all be because of the waitress. I suggest they talk to her and maybe get some entertainment going. It is a nice local place and I would hate to see it go away."}
{"text":"The Tap House is a great place to grab a beer with friends. It has a good vibe, the servers are friendly, there are pool tables, a juke box and Kareoke.   The food at the Tap House is average. It is mostly typical bar fare. Much of the menu is fried and it tastes like fried food you can get anywhere. The rest of the menu offerings leave much to be desired.  Supposedly, they have specials that are pretty good, including the Monte Cristo. People I went with usually went crazy over it."}
{"text":"Got there 12:15 with 45 minutes till 1:00 appointment around the corner.  Burger, patty melt, French fries and onion rings came 40 minutes later.  Had it boxed for home.  Sandwiches were good and burger big and juicy but the French fries were limp and would not crisp in the oven.  The bad news was that my wife's extra cost onion rings turned out to be more limp fries!"}
{"text":"The night was so fun ... fish fry, which was yummy pieces of cod, home made fries ... and coleslaw ... and it is all you can eat!  The greatest singer for the entertainment ... wanted to get up and dance to all of his music!  However, that is not the reason for the five stars ...  our server was CECILIA ... she was charming, witty, could not have been more pleasant ... now she is the REAL reason we will be returning.  We witnessed customers that were rude and crude ... and she persevered, and held true to Tap House and their commitment to service.  She should be cloned as a top server anywhere!  Thank you, Tap House for employing THE BEST!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are pretty good. What's amazing is the staff's lack of concern for customers. We've visited a handful of times, and no one seems to pay attention or care that you walked into the restaurant. I couldn't tell if someone was working, or if they were, perhaps they didn't want anyone to be there.   The atmosphere is quiet (almost dead) and the place looks old and tired (some of the booths are ripping). Not sure if they have A/C. One time, they kept the backdoor open and it was really warm in there.   Still, the burgers and fries were pretty good--just need to work on customer service and sprucing up the place. Best wishes in that."}
