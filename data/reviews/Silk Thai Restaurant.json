{"text":"Food was great.  

My friend kept complaining that they need more than an open door in the hot muggy days of summer.  Perhaps now they have A/C, and if so the rating would change to a five star rating."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai restaurant in the Junction!!  I've been here a couple of times now.  For appetizers, we had the fried wontons, shrimp chips, and hot/sour soup.  The fried wontons were delicious, and so was the fish sauce that came with it.  Shrimp chips were good, so was the hot/sour soup.  The red curry beef was delicious, and the portions were very generous.  Last night, I tried the fried fish with curry.  It was a little more expensive than the other dishes, but well worth it.  Despite the few bones, it was absolutely delicious.  The restaurant itself is WAY bigger than it looks like from the outside.  It definitely has a distinct \"Thai\" atmosphere inside with their decor, and totally puts you in the mood for some good Thai food.  Our server was super nice as well.  No complaints here guys.  Go ahead and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Makes one of the best Thai Curries I have ever had. They also deliver which is fantastic. The owners and delivery-man are all very friendly and remember me (since I go there/order from them so often.) I always modify my meal a bit and they've never messed up what I order which is great. The prices are great as well!"}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEATS and won't order from this restaurant again. 
Ordered the following: 
Coconut Soup - best of the order, great broth. 
Coconut Rice - quite good! 
Pad Thai - passable at best. Bland but not offensive. 
Spicy basil eggplant - Not much eggplant. Somewhat spicy but not flavourful. 
Butter chicken - AWFUL. Truly. The worst I've ever had. I know that it was my bad for ordering an Indian dish from a Thai restaurant but man, this was gag-worthy. 
Naan - Basically store bought Pitas. Doughy but heavy. No flavour. 
I really wanted to like this place but it was just so disappointing."}
{"text":"Arguably the best thai in the city for take away, I've never eaten in the actual restaurant and have rarely seen others eating there, it's kind of dark but the decor is nice and obviously Thai themed.

The shrimp chips, green chicken curry and papaya salad are staples when we order, I've tried some other things too and they're ok. We usually order enough to get a free pad thai which is good (not made with ketchup like Spring Rolls) and I think you have to order like $40 worth of food. We usually get it \"thai hot\" which means really hot, lots of peppers.

As others have noted the ordering system is a bit chaotic, we always order over the phone and I always review my order with them when I pick it up to make sure everything is in there correctly, so far no issues.

Delivery is limited though, I live in Bloor West village and they don't deliver that far."}
{"text":"We waited 1.5 hours for delivery, nobody called us to tell us they were going to be late. When you have kids and you say 35 minutes, it's important your honest, and give people a heads up when your going to be an hour late.  The sad part was the food was not bad, I guess customer service is not important to big restaurants like this, but it matters to families."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic food. Great service. This is my go to Thai place in the city.  Love the drunk enough noodles and classic pad Thai"}
{"text":"This is a review of delivery only. We have been burned by many many delivery places and only order in every couple months now. Thai food has been notoriously underwhelming in Toronto. I was pleasantly surprised by Silk. 

We ordered ginger beef, shrimp curry stir fry, green papaya salad, and chicken satay. 
The satay was actually authentic Thai satay, similar to what I've had abroad. The peanut sauce was savory, not sweet and the chicken was perfectly marinated & grilled. I was only given one small (delicious) bite of the ginger beef because my partner had bogarted the whole dish to himself. It had a significant ginger kick. My tiger shrimp curry was well balanced with a variety of veggies: bok choy, red & green pepper, onion. The tiger shrimp were amazing - grilled to slightly crispy and then mixed in with the sauce & veggies. 

Neither of the dishes had that flavor of mall-food (is it grease? sugar? MSG?)  that so many thai places seem to have in Toronto. 
The green papaya salad was crisp and pungent with a good smattering of chili - not for the faint-hearted. 

Of course it wasn't totally perfect: none of the dishes came with rice and the person who took my order didn't suggest ordering rice. I guess I am so accustomed to rice coming with entrees that it really bothers me when they don't. 
Delivery took a bit over an hour on a Sunday night. Not terrible, but also something to consider. 

And lastly, the website links to the menu only worked in Safari, not Chrome, on Mac. 

Overall, we will definitely order again."}
{"text":"*update 2nd Visit/Take Out

Ordered a Beef Cantonese Chow Mein (yes it's Chinese at a Thai joint).
All the ingredients were good and fresh. Noodles fried crispy proper on the edges of the dish.

Sadly they stopped serving sushi due to lack of interest but may bring it back in the future.

Updated to 4-star. Will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I ordered online, received a confirmation email with order number and then waited over an hour. When I called the restaurant to inquire the woman who answered just kept saying it didnt go through, she cant see it on her computer. So of course I asked why i received  a confirmation email if the order didnt go through, she just kept saying she couldnt see anything on her computer, and it didnt show up on her iphone. No apology, no mention of looking into the problem, she just kept repeating she couldnt see it. Then she says well do you still want the food? Like the whole conversation was an inconvenience to her."}
{"text":"A friend and I were meeting up for dinner in The Junction and decided on Silks based on other yelpers' reviews. The decor was interesting with it's fake plants and abundance of lighted Buddhas mixed with the soothing sounds of instrumental and classical music. There was only 2 or 3 other tables, as it was a Monday night, so service was great - prompt and attentive. 

We ordered vegetable spring rolls and daily soup, which was lentil soup, to start. The spring rolls were just ordinary, more wrapping than filling but the dipping sauce (fish sauce, I believe) is my favourite. I hate when places serve spring rolls with soy sauce or something else just as random. The soup was very good and packed full of lentils and vegetables. For mains I ordered Spicy Mixed Seafood and my friend had Golden Curry Shrimp both with a side of steamed rice. The portions were pretty large, we could only finish about half, and they weren't kidding about the spicy. I like spicy, but I am a still Caucasian so I don't do burn-your-mouth-off spicy. This was just a little beyond my comfort level and had to drink copious amounts of water. But the flavour over-all was very good. My friend also enjoyed her Curry but she found it more intense than at other places. And the dishes they served them on were pretty neat  - blue and white theme. My plate was actually shaped like a fish!


I would go back to try out different things as I live in the area."}
{"text":"We ordered from skip the dishes.... it took an 1 hours and  45 mins for our food to arrive. It was \"expected in 40-60 mins. It was really not ok.  If you can't meet the demand, please be honest about that. 
The wonton soup was the best part of the meal. It was a bit expensive for wonton soup, but was a really good size so that was totally fine.  The spring rolls  met expectations.  The butter chicken was a huge disappointment (I told my sister it probably wasn't best I order butter chicken from a thai place). It was 14$ but came with about 5 pieces chicken the siZe of Legos, and didn't make up for it in taste. 
The papaya salad was good, but it was supposed to come with long beans and did not.  
I'm not saying it's a terrible place... but our experience just was not good.  So with all the other options, we probably won't order again."}
{"text":"Found Silk while reading reviews of other Thai restaurants on Yelp which suggested this place instead.  Called to order pickup after looking at the website; the website kind of sucks because it's a bit difficult to navigate.  Also, maybe I missed it but it didn't appear to advertise the fact that if your order totals $40 before taxes you get a free pad thai.  We called in the order half an hour before close and got there just at closing time; our order was waiting for us, and the hostess soon appeared to cash me out.  Seeing as this place was a little out of our way I asked if there was a discount for pick-up (there isn't), and then asked about the sign outside the restaurant that mentioned something about a free pad thai.  She confirmed that orders over $40 do get that; she blushed when I pointed out that my order was $39.50 before taxes and I wish I had known that when I ordered cause I would have taken advantage of that deal.  So she responded by basically knocking the tax off my order and told me to just pay her $40.  Pretty decent adjustment in my book, and I got back in the car with a smile.

Once at home I opened the bag and was immediately pleased at two things: the clear-lidded, small plastic containers on top revealed a bright, fresh peanut sauce composed of chopped peanuts and red onion, and a not-out-of-an-industrial-tub sweet sour sauce, and beneath the sauces the appetizer order was packed in a cardboard- not styrofoam- container.  I really dislike styrofoam as food packaging so this was encouraging.  And indeed, both sauces were good, especially the peanut.

We ordered the seafood appetizer platter: the fried calamari was pretty standard but tasty; my husband immediately noted that the shrimp cakes had visible shrimp in them, and although a tad on the salty side, they were very good; the shrimp spring rolls were THE BEST spring rolls I've had- there was a single, large GRILLED (or was it roasted?) shrimp in the middle of each, rolled up with typical spring roll veggies; and the Thai fresh rolls were stuffed with bright, fresh Thai basil, cilantro, carrot, lettuce, mint(?), and egg.  Despite this appetizer containing several deep-fried items, nothing was greasy or heavy, and you could tell they used fresh, quality ingredients (I keep using the word \"fresh\" but it's just so accurate!)  Oh, and the quantity was just right for two hungry people with big appetites to complement their main dishes.  

Husband had wanted regular old chicken pad thai, but we noticed the golden chicken pad thai and he decided to try that.  Did not regret it- instead of the typical orange-y tamarind based sauce, it was tossed in a mild but yummy golden curry sauce.  The portion was decent, the chicken was of the highest quality, tender, all white meat, and plentiful.  Sprouts were fresh, noodles good- not greasy, not too starchy.  Only (small) complaint was they only threw in one slice of lime for squeezing over it.  You could gobble down a whole order of this (which he did) and afterwards feel contented, not bloated.  

I ordered the mango chicken off the \"Wok\" section of the menu, with a side of steamed jasmine rice.  The portion was generous, the chicken again of the highest quality and also plentiful; it was mixed with tender-crisp stir fry carrots, onion, peppers, and lots of match-stick cut, just-ripe mango.  Delicious, healthy, and satisfying.  These three words pretty much sum up our entire order.  We have found our new, go-to Thai place in Toronto.  Go to Silk; keep them in business.  They charge the same prices as so many other Thai restaurants in this city but their food is several orders of magnitude better than the other places.  Go to Silk :)"}
{"text":"We got takeout. I ordered the shrimp pad thai, and others ordered veg pad thai, thai spicy noodles and drunk noodles.

The pad was just ok for me. Now when I received it the noodles were a little dry and they had conformed to the shape of the container, so it was hard to separate them. The shrimp was cooked nicely but it seemed a little fishy to me. I tried the other dishes and they were ok too but they didn't blow my mind or anything.

The best part was that the price was good for the portion-size and we have lots left over, also, they sent us some complimentary fried bananas!
I may try this place eating in instead of out if we go again."}
{"text":"Newly moved into the neighbourhood and was looking for a good Thai place. Saw this place had great ratings so decided to give it a go. We ordered takeout and the food arrived promptly but everything after that was extremely disappointing. The pad thai was not flavorful at all and the red curry was also extremely bland. A few days later the leftovers are still sitting in I our fridge... We won't be touching them. This may be the best Thai in the neighbourhood... But that doesn't mean it is good. I will not be giving this place a second chance. I will either wait to eat at khao san road or sukhothai when I am downtown."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. They have a nice menu full of lunch options mostly in the $9 range for a smaller entree portion with white rice, sweet/sour tofu soup, and a veggie egg roll. 
I ordered the vegan green curry lunch dish and asked for extra spicy. The curry was great, had a nice chili kick that built up nicely through the meal. The egg roll was perfect.
There was only one server during the lunch hour so the service was slow.lbut the food was tasty, so definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"The Thai chicken fried rice is delicious, maybe the best fried rice I've had. The portion is generous, and they're not stingy with the chicken! Will definitely be going back. It'll be hard to resist simply ordering the same thing again!

Go there, give them business so they stay open!"}
{"text":"Pretty much ditto what the review below me said.  Food is pretty good.  Delivery time is HORRIBLE consistently...this time waited 1.5 hours for Chicken pad Thai....Brutal...won't be ordering from them anymore....ridiculous!"}
{"text":"A very solid performer.  We ordered takeout from here, and my wife had an amazing coconut soup of some kind.  She was sick before having it, but this helped a lot in her recovery.  All other dishes were very solid performers, and I'd definitely recommend this to others when in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Waiter tried to short change me 5 bucks.  Maybe an honest mistake but it didn't take but a second to give me me correct change when I said this isn't right.  I have honestly had better Thai food at fast food court.  Pad wan sen had 2.5 shrimp, the tid bit chicken was boiled and taste less.  The noodles were a clump and virtually tasteless.  The spring rolls were a bit over cooked and burnt tasting.  34 bucks for take out for 1 and the left overs aren't worth reheating tomorrow.  Oh ya.. The mango salad.  Easily forgotten.  Very disappointed as the place was recommended by a friend."}
{"text":"First time dining at this restaurant; we had a later lunch on a sunny Saturday afternoon and not too busy.  It's a pretty sizeable family-run restaurant, a bit dated and rustic but comfortable.  We had the lunch specials which come with a soup and spring roll.  Mango chicken and chicken pad thai entrees were delicious - fresh, authentic and huge portions.  We'd gladly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow! Everything delicious. Very friendly owners. No MSG on any dish! The place needs to work on the interior design."}
{"text":"This place is beautifully decorated and the food matches! Excellent mango chicken, Thai curry noodles, and pineapple fried rice. best Thai food I've had in a long time and the service is wonderful as well. Highly recommend this place and will definitely return."}
{"text":"First time at Silk. Read Yelp reviews so I didn't order delivery, called ahead for pickup. They told me 40 minutes. Got there 45 minutes later (couldn't find parking anywhere) and was told it would be another 10-15 minutes. I waited in my car since I was illegally parked and went in 15 minutes later. They handed me my bag but I realize the price was different from what they said over the phone - turns out it wasn't my food and they just gave my food away. They called the person who took my food and he had to return back to the restaurant to make the exhange with me, another 15 minutes or so. Well over an hour after I ordered I got my food. I expected for the trouble that they would discount my order or throw in some free spring rolls or something, but nothing. 

As for the food, the spring rolls were excellent, the pad thai was pretty good but nothing amazing. The mango chicken however was easily the worst I've ever had, pretty much tasteless."}
{"text":"Long waiting time on Sunday and we were the only table dine-in so a bit disappointed.The plus are the waitress/host was really friendly and helpful and their papaya salad + Silk pad Thai + green curry  are good."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the westend - way better than friendly or Baan Thai!"}
{"text":"Like others we were surprised how big and warm this place is once you get in there and go to the back. It's HUGE. The front display of this place does it NO justice. They should really do something about that.

Food was great, came quickly, staff was really friendly and efficient.

There was some lady there who apparently delivers for them, who was going around table to table handing out delivery menus and chatting people up. She was a bit much and I think she was a bit drunk. I don't know maybe she's just eccentric. 

Not a big deal but just kind of odd.

So yeah now they deliver within the area. Which we may take them up on, since we live somewhat near by. Time will tell if they'll be able to beat out Friendly Thai for best delivery in the area though. We'll be back to try more dishes, for sure."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is a hidden gem! 

From the outside it doesn't look like much. In fact, I've walked by it probably 1,000 times without much notice. 

Inside it is quite spacious and beautiful! 

On a Monday night they had $2 special for a glass of wine. I ordered white and it was really good! 

Pad Thai was fabulous (which is hard to come by) and Green curry was legitimately spicy. Portions are generous. 

Yes- there was cheesy pan flute music playing soft rock cover songs...but have you ever been to Thailand? It is very popular there! He he

I'm so thrilled to have discovered this neighbourhood spot! Can't wait to return.

PS. Also, they have brown rice as an option. Bonus!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!! The best Thai food I've had in Toronto. It tastes authentic.

When you walk into the restaurant, the kitchen is near the front and you can see them cooking. I've always gotten takeout, but when I've been inside, the seating area is nice looking with dark lighting.

The lemongrass soup is incredibly flavorful. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. I've had it three times.

The tiger shrimp spring rolls are fantastic. So are the shrimp chips. Before Silk, I felt shrimp chips were a waste of money because they had a barely-there taste and not much substance. Not at Silk! You can tell it was made with real shrimp, not some sort of 'from the sea' flavoring. 

My boyfriend had Panang Beef and really enjoyed it. We've also ordered a few curry dishes and whenever we open the lid, we always inhale deeply and say to the other 'You have to smell this!!!' 

So good. Keep these people in business. Go eat there tonight!!!"}
{"text":"Very decent Thai food in The Junction.
I had the golden pad Thai with chicken and shrimp.
There are only 2 Thai places in The Junction. I would come again as it's only 35 minutes walk from home.
The prices are reasonable and the service is great."}
{"text":"There was only one waitress so there were frequent delays in getting service although she did her best. The food was nothing special. We had the appetizer platter and I had the pad see ew while my wife had the eggplant with sticky rice. Pad see ew taste was pretty good, but the chicken was dry. The eggplant was not bad either. The decor was nice. It wasn't authentic, but it was something nice to look at."}
{"text":"Took 2 hours for the food to arrive. When it did it was sloppily prepared, and tasted much worse then Thai food I've ordered in the past from them and other restaurants. Everything has a sickly sour flavour, that was not well balanced by other Thai flavours. The fresh rolls fell apart making them inedible. Overall this was a very bad experience."}
{"text":"Everything we had was very tasty and well prepared. Had the satay chicken,  calamari and panang beef with golden curry. Mmmmmm delicious!  This is my new Thai place!  Service is a bit slow but perhaps its just because I was hungry and everything was so good I inhaled my food."}
{"text":"We had ordered delivery from them when they were Young Thailand and were not impressed, but eating in at this new location was very nice.  The decor is soothing and attractive, and the dishes were all winners.  My red curry was especially good.  As with the other reviewer, we also noticed a dearth of diners here, perhaps due to the somewhat ungainly Junction location near Keele and Dundas.

Also agree about the music - pan pipe renditions of 50's and 60's era cocktail lounge songs.  One other minor criticism was that the rest room area in the back, while clean, needed updating to match the rest of the place.

One should note that street parking in this area is free after 6 PM."}
{"text":"Silk is rated as the best thai restaurant in The Junction, and after visiting last night for dinner (dine-in) it did not disappoint. My friend and I started with two cups of green tea to warm up from the frosty night and they were served in these beautiful cups and saucers with beautiful artwork. We wanted to take them home with us!

Then for an appetizer we had an order of their spring rolls. For $6 you get four long spring rolls with a delicious sauce. A lot of places you are charged that much and only get two, so very impressed by that. 

We both got the Silk Pad Thai for or meal, and both were super impressed. Very flavourful, a great proportion of mean (chicken), noddles, vegetables and topped with a generous helping of shredded peanuts. Probably the best pad thai I have had in this city so far. 

Definitely will be going here or ordering from here many times in the future!"}
{"text":"NEVER order from here. I placed an order that literally took an hour and a half to arrive. To make things a million times worse, once the delivery guy actually showed up, he had the goddamn nerve to open my door rather than knock. I'm a single woman and live alone. That was beyond unacceptable. Then the guy had the goddamn nerve to argue with me that there's no way I placed an order an hour and a half ago until I told him I could show him my online receipt. I rejected the order and he still had the nerve to say I couldn't do that. YOU OPENED A STRANGER'S DOOR.

Absolutely atrocious behaviour. Jesus Christ."}
{"text":"The owner And his family who own this restaurant ours extremely amazing people who really care, I recommend the pad Thai, there jasmine rice is also amazing I always combo it up with some kind of stirfry, all their ingredients are fresh, what I like about them is if you have a vegetarian or vegan friend you're able to invite them as their restaurant has a plethora of vegan and vegetarian food, I'd absolutely give them five stars not only are they cheap eats but they deliver so fast. Even during busy times, The food is fantastic the service is great the Decour is amazing, if you're planning on just ordering in it'll get to you promptly and just to be as fresh as in the restaurant... Do not hesitate to eat here"}
{"text":"Used UberEATS to get the pad thai with chicken and shrimp, portion is huge, however the whole thing tasted completely like ketchup.... I tried pad thai so many times both in Thailand and in Toronto, this is the worst I have ever tasted... very disappointed. I should have read the comments on Yelp before placing the order, waste of money."}
{"text":"After dealing with a former favorite Bua Thai,and their bad customer care,I checked out Silk. Ordered a couple of Thai glass noodle salads for a get together over the holidays. The guests were conservative eaters for the most part,so to my surprise all who tried enjoyed the noodles! As for me,it is what I expected,where nothing was over cooked either. Price was also competitive for the dish,so was happy .


I really hope they do well,and more in the area will check out their food. IF Silk ever got a food truck, I think they would make a killing from late spring to end of fall:) 


Only gave Silk a four star due to the limited order,but will return for more menu items. 


FYI,Glass noodles are gluten free because they're made from \"green bean, broad bean, and/or pea flour [D.Schmidt.About Dot.com].\"

Silk staff,or owner,if you check this post,as of today,your website's not loading the menu in Chrome,or Firefox.In IE,it loads,then the pdf will not show the menu items."}
{"text":"I was really hopeful about this place but it is honestly awful. 
Bland, bland, bland. To put it simply i wish i had ketchup to put on the meal. Tofu and Taro (wet and under cooked) Hot and sour soup tasted like gelatin and the house Silk pad Thai was white dry noodles. I know we ordered the run of the mill menu but I am well versed on authentic/diverse Thai and this is not it in fact this is as bad as frozen loblaws knock offs."}
{"text":"Really good food and service. We've tried tons of Thai places and this one had, IMO the most authentic tasting (but less spicy!) Thai food I've had since being in Thailand . We tried the red curry, jungle curry and papaya salad. All three were excellent!"}
{"text":"There are only three options for Thai food in the Junction and Silk is one of them.

We were lured in on a Friday night by a $20 dinner special on a sandwich board outside - dinner for 2  that included hot & sour sour soup, orange chicken cashew with rice and spicy Thai noodles.  We decided to give it a go.

Silk is a pretty big space.  There's seating at the front of the restaurant and as you head towards the back, it opens up into a large dining room.  We decided to sit in the back area.

Service was quick and food arrived soon after ordering.  Unfortunately, the dishes weren't that great.  We've eaten at Silk previously and remember the food being much, much better.  Perhaps it was just the dishes we had that night or maybe it was an off night? 

I'm not a fan of hot & sour soup anyway but it was a nice starter on a rainy night as it came piping hot.  The orange cashew chicken was decent with chunks of fresh orange in it but the Thai spicy noodles were just a tasteless pile of hot mess.

We'll be sure to avoid those specific dishes in the future but will be back to try something else."}
{"text":"The food is good (not great) and the people are so sweet but... This is the third time that they have gotten my order wrong (both delivery and takeout). Tonight, I cashed out and they handed me my bags. One of them had too many items in it so I had them open it and remove a green curry that I had not ordered. The other item looked to be a pad Thai but when I got home, it was not. Sorry Silk, three strikes and you're out. It's a constant issue. 

For everyone that orders from here. Make sure you check the contents closely before you leave."}
{"text":"A friend recommended I go to Silk for the best thai food in the West end. This location was formerly called Young Thailand, but they both have the same proprietor, Wandee Young. 

The decor in Silk is very traditional, dark and often with very bizarre elevator type music playing. Don't let this distract you from the wonderful thai food. The green curry is my favourite, a spicy curry that burns just enough but is so full of sweet flavour that it's worth it. The cold rolls and mango salad are some of the best I have had in Toronto. The portion sizes are ample and the prices are average. They deliver to the High Park/Junction area.

What astounds me about this place is that there are never more than 3 tables of diners. This restaurant is delicious! The word must get out."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Thai food--and lunch specials are definitely worth it!  $8.95 for spring rolls, soup and a made to order dish!  On par (in terms of price point with mall food courts) but better quality!  

Service is always great!  The restaurant can use an upgrade but otherwise it's a lovely family owned and run restaurant."}
{"text":"Always respect this place. Not much to say other then the reason I come back is a semi distinct quality to their dishes, at reasonable prices. A strong 4"}
{"text":"ordered takeout here last weekend. some prices are a bit high, maybe because of the neighbourhood. I just got curry chicken rice and hot n sour soup. the order was brought promptly. the curry could have had significantly more meat and veggies, also used to get egg bits but this one lacked it. the soup was a bit hot for me, the balance was more towards hot than sour. I was able to ate just half of it, other ingredients were okay. I would not re-order the soup but the rice possibly, and try something else too but just because it's in my part of town, wouldn't go out of my way for this place.
3.5/5"}
{"text":"Been coming to Silk for over a year now and have to say it's awesome!!! Love that there are many vegan options here that taste good and aren't overloaded with salt and MSG. Love it here!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise to celebrate a late dinner for Valentine's Day! This Thai place is very nice with Thai decorations of statutes and lamps with a fireplace. They decorated it with Valentine's Day decorations hearts and tablecloths. 

We ordered an appetizer, 2 entrees and one dessert. The food was great and it came in really nice heart shape plates. They have a great variety of pad Thai and a different assortment of sauces that you can put into the pad Thai. Everything came piping hot other then the fresh spring rolls. I was a little disappointed in the appetizer because it didn't taste very good. The dessert was nice but the mangos were not in season so it definitely could be better in the summer."}
{"text":"If this is the same company as the Silk that has now opened on Parliament St in Cabbagetown, it is great. My boyfriend and I have ordered from there twice (delivery) and both times it arrived earlier than the anticipated time. On both occasions, the food arrived hot and it is SO good. I would highly recommend this place."}
