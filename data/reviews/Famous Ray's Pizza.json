{"text":"Good peeps good pizza. I'm from NY so I know New York style you cannot go wrong here.  If you want fancy pizza with all that fancy stuff then fugetaboutit!!!"}
{"text":"The first call to place an order I was hung up on, called back n there was a polite female who took our order n was told 20 min. Arrives n 14 n waited an additional  30 min. The cook appeared to be in a bad mood. Foods was good just don't believe the service worth it?"}
{"text":"Pretty awful. Might work if you've never been to New York/ tasted pizza before. canned mushrooms got no place on a pizza in 2015 America"}
{"text":"I have only been there once. Large Cheese pie and it was legit, a little crunch in the crust and the sauce and cheese cooked and melded together. The salad was pretty pedestrian. I'd like to try a few more items and would be willing to upgrade to a 5-star review after a larger sample"}
{"text":"Discusting!  They don't use gloves, the pizza is a far cry from New York & I was overcharged for their combo special.  I tried to address the issue and it confused the cashier (who also made my salad...without washing hands). thumbs down."}
{"text":"Ordered 1-2. On the ago.  Toppings had fallen to one side,  leaving the other without and so expensive.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"Using yelp, I got a great deal here. But the food took forever and the man behind the counter couldn't even crack a smile. No doubt it was good pizza though!"}
{"text":"I suppose if you're form the East Coast, this is a great place for you to go. It will be exactly what you're used to. Floppy pie cut pizza.......It was ready when I got there, hot and steamy.  East Coast Folks.......Stop reading this review right now.     If you're from Chicago, don't go here. Don't waste your time, you don't need to convince yourself that Chicago Pizza is better. I've tried East Coast Pizza several times now and its very clear they don't know what they're doing, and its not a personal stab at this particular place. Sorry to jump on the age old debate, but it is what it is. Chicago simply does it better. Razor Thin to 5lb Stuffed and everything in between.  Not a place THIS Chicagoan is going to go back to again for pizza, although I'd still like to try some of the other things on their menu as they looked very enticing. I will stick to my local Chicago Style Pizza Joint for a nice thin crust square cut pizza! :-)"}
{"text":"I am always an opened minded person and also can give the benefit of the doubt and also address credit when credit is due. So my last review about this place I was upset a little not because the food was bad or anything it was actually good but I am  always getting teased about being hispanic and not able to even eat the mild sauce from taco bell without sweating and panting with my tongue for a drink. Lol But I had ordered mild and received hot last time and wasn't pleased because I honestly at 4 wings and the rest sat in the fridge for a week before I threw them out. I had called and someone offered me 12 wings and I thought it was fair but I am not the type to really complain or go running to get free food like some people would do but needless to say I was contacted by vinnie and offered to replace my whole order and even a pizza. I offered to pay for the pizza because again I am not a free food person. I know nothing in this world is free unless it's your birthday then there is an exception. Ha ha ha Well I met with vinnie and he was awesome and very friendly and approachable I got the pizza and wings and able to eat the wings this time it was amazing. Best wings I have had in years they were juicy and crunchy and not small. I have been to some places where the wings are so small you get like one and a half bite of it but these wings are huge and the pizza that I was able to try for the first time was amazing as well. The cheese was flowing and piping hot and the sauce has to be a secret recipe past down from a family genius because it was perfect and not too over spiced or sweet. I am so glad he contacted me to try it out again and I know that our family Friday night pizza will be ordered from this place going forward in the future.  My kids even ate the crust and not sure about other people's kids but for mine to eat the crust it's nothing short of a miracle. Awesome food and great people and I will continue to be a repeat customer and I think that if you are reading reviews to figure which pizza place to try then look no further because this place is not expensive, delicious and will feed the whole family for under 25 bucks. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Haven't had this in a long time. Every bit as good as I remember. Love it, best pizza in the city. Use the yelp deal it's great!"}
{"text":"Ray's Has Some Of The Best Pizza I Have Had In A While. Great Toppings, Not Greasy. I Will Be Returning For More, Also Great Prices!!"}
{"text":"The service was great. The pizza was okay. They included more than enough toppings, but most of it seemed like canned ingredients. It would be a definite buy if the pricing was more competitive. I might not try it again, but I think it's worth trying once to decide for yourself."}
{"text":"yummy hot pizza ordered pepperoni and cheese, nothing crazy just needed a quick lunch and was happy to get too very hot slices. took my husband and son back on the weekend and saw some older women eating some pasta dishes there that looked really good, definitely want to try that next time we go"}
{"text":"Fast service. Great pizza. Ordered an XL and it was very crispy on bottom...which is hard to do but they did it! Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Not bad for Phoenix.  The pizza was way too thick for any place associating itself with a Ray's NY style.  Also, upstate type wings are fresh and served with blue cheese not ranch dressing.  Almost $50 for 2 pies with a couple toppings and 20 wings."}
{"text":"Great place for a great slice! Always get 2 cheese pizzas and always come out right! Love this place,, I can eat it everyday!!"}
{"text":"I'll make it short... I ordered a large cheese pizza with crispy crust and the owner told me 15 minutes. I picked up the pizza, drove home, and it was completely soggy and cold almost to the point of being raw (doughy).  I called the owner back and explained the problem and he told me \"I'll take care of you when you come back\".  I revisited two weeks later and ordered the pizza at the location this time (Happy Valley/ I17) and when I reminded him of the agreement from the doughy pizza he then said the pizza was only doughy because of me. Seeing as how I did not MAKE the pizza, I give this place 1 star. Do yourself a favor and go to any other Ray's location except this one. The owner is not connected to the family that runs all the other locations, hence the poor service. Bobby messed up when he sold this location for sure. I will be going to the 7th Street location from now on to get cooked pizza!"}
{"text":"This place has the best New York pizza in Phoenix, haven't been here in years being that we moved over an hour away. Nothing has changed still great!!!"}
{"text":"Food is decent  Ordered two slices with my large pizza. None were ready. Waited 15 minutes and then got cold anchovies and sauce. Paid for ranch and got home and no ranch. Once we finally got home called back to ask what happened and they said the guy who took your order left, sorry. Then hung up. What a terrible experience for a well reviewed place. Makes me wonder if these places pay YELP to write good reviews."}
{"text":"Great pie. Wonderful staff. Very relaxing and filling. Surely will be back and recommend it above any of the chains."}
{"text":"I been going to this place ever since I moved out here from NY they know my family very well. I also have had the honor of eating at the rays in the city and honestly I can still remember them both tasting identical from the pizza to the Jamaican beef patties THIS IS THE REAL NY PIZZA!!!"}
{"text":"I am originally from NJ so I am quite demanding when it comes to pizza.  I ordered the chicken parm sandwich since i had a bit of a crave for that.    As I waited (about 15 minutes), i saw the guys making, slicing and sending out the pizza.  I then was wishing I had ordered the pizza to check it out.  The chicken parm?  It was good.  A decent size sandwich for the money.  Was still hot when I got to my friend's place 7 min away.  I left wanting the pizza though since it looked and smelled quite good.  Next time for sure..."}
{"text":"Pizza is okay.  Pasta is just okay. Service is really bad."}
{"text":"When I saw the $20 for $10 deal at Rays I jumped on it.  Ordered the breaded chicken w/ spaghetti dinner.  My buddy ordered the sausage hero sub.  I was amazed when they told us we needed to order something else to use the entire $20 deal.  We choose the cheese garlic bread.  The food was great and the service was good. Could not have asked for more!"}
{"text":"Always good pizza never any complaints about it. Got wings with the pizza and wings where super tiny. That's really the only complaint I can have"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews however I just spent $8.00 on a greasy, warm(not hot) piece of pizza and a salad (that went straight to the trash it was so awful). Save your money I would rather have a Little Caesar pizza then eat at Rays again."}
{"text":"Eating here right now. Food is very good, but come hungry.  The lasagna portion is large. My husband's meatball sandwich is really good and very large. We saw this restaurant in NY and wanted to try it but ran out of time. We will definitely come back next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Friendly workers, appears family owned. Got cheese pizza. Very good if you like New York style pizza - a little thinner and nice simple sauce and cheese flavors. Bottom of pizza maintains a nice crispness and the crust isn't bulky. The meal deals are very reasonably priced. Definitely my new go-to for pizza!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the worst pizza in The Valley. The restaurant is dirty and annoyingly loud. The staff is inattentive and more concerned with gossiping than doing their job. If you want overcooked, bland pizza, served up along side all of the worst New York stereotypes imaginable, you could still do better than Ray's."}
{"text":"This place was awesome , really pretty girl working cashier good service delicious PIZZA  definitely recommend going there and I'll sure be going whenever I have the chance again"}
{"text":"2 words.    Yum Yum  I havent met a Rays that I dont like,  and thats a scientific fact."}
{"text":"Overpriced and below average slice. 2 small slices of pizza for 8 bucks!!?? At least the decor was nice"}
{"text":"This is one of the only restaurants where we can all eat, including a picky kid and a vegetarian. We all love their pizza and pasta. We usually get the two slices special, which is perfect."}
{"text":"4.5 stars! Picked up a pizza and small order of garlic knots. I have no idea how big their large is, but the small order was definitely enough for 4 people. Comes with a side of delicious marinara also. Our pizza was pepperoni and mushroom and it was great, too. The pizza crust was not soggy at all. We loved it and wouldn't have found it without yelp :)"}
{"text":"Been going there for 15 years.  Great pizza!!  Real NY style pizza at a fair price."}
{"text":"The best Brooklyn Style Pizza in Phoenix. They even have Jamaica Beef Patties. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best New York style pizza in the state. Food is real good reminds me of my home in Brooklyn"}
{"text":"Bad A$$ Pizza!!!  Victor is awesome! Just like your in New York eating the best pizza with a perfected crunch to the crust. Great not your average topping as well! Will be a regular!"}
{"text":"I wish there was something positive worth noting. Unfortunately, the prices are high and inconsistent, the service is terrible (manager/owner especially) and the quality is low.  On my recent visit (and last ever), I called and ordered by phone. Upon arriving, I noticed that what I ordered was coincidentally on special. Despite the clear posting of the special price, the owner insisted I pay full price because I did not mention the word \"special\" on the phone..how could I have known? He did so much as to point and wag his finger at me in a condescending way and mumble something in another language.   When I brought the food home it was a greasy, unappetizing mess. For the $36 or whatever it was for a medium and wings, I think I'd rather have 36 Totinos pizzas than eat here again."}
{"text":"Pizza and wings are very good.  But service is crappy.  Every guy working there was not happy, didn't make you feel valued or important as a customer.  I don't need to feel all warm and fuzzy to get good food but sure am not going to give 5 stars when the guys filling our order are glaring at us like we just killed their puppy.  Maybe someone just got a backside-chewing.  Will give them another chance and hope for  decent service and still get good food."}
{"text":"We ate here 20 years ago and then moved away. Just came back for a visit and it's still delicious.  The service is very friendly and the pizza is amazing. The crust is the perfect balance of crispy and chewy.  The sliced sausage topping is my favorite. Pizza slice with sausage and pepperoni, dipped in ranch dressing.. Yum!"}
{"text":"Don't expect them to wear gloves. One lady is cooking pizza in sandals. Not sure it's worth getting sick eating here. Also, not the friendliest people."}
{"text":"Love Ray's! My family has been ordering from here for years. They go out of their way to make you happy. I love the wings! Their white pizza is amazing. The wait everyone complains about is because everything is fresh just for you, takes time for him to throw your dough before he fires it up!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, average rest of menu. Guys that answer the phone are a little rough around the edges but you expect that at an authentic pizza joint. I recommend this place over most."}
{"text":"Solid New York Pizza here. Best in Phoenix hands down."}
{"text":"Tasty wings, pizza was good. Only thing I wasn't satisfied with was the price. A bit expensive in my opinion for pizza and wings. Overall good food though :)"}
{"text":"Such a great place for pizza and wings! No matter what location you go to you will have the same high quality pizza. Great prices, great atmosphere and great food. Some of the staff could be a bit friendlier, but it wouldn't stop me from coming."}
{"text":"Love love love the white pizza!!! Super friendly staff, def going back ever time in town!!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza and the staff. The gravy could use some work. I'm a regular and it's the only place I'll get down home local (to me) pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza folks. I've had a lot of pizzas in my time but this pizza ranks right up there with the very best I've had. They put generous amounts of toppings on there pizzas and the crust is by far more superior than most other pizza places out there. Don't just take my word on this folks, try one for yourselves. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings! Everyone that works there is really nice too! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I really love their pizza! It's always so hot, fresh, and yummy!   The only reasons I am giving Rays four stars is because sometimes their service isn't the best (a few times the cashier was on her cell phone when I was waiting to order which I think is pretty rude) and they are stingy with their drinks. They charge for refills whereas much of their competition does not.  Despite those two things, I have a hard time not wanting to eat Rays!"}
{"text":"Pizza is decent. Wings are pretty good. As a New Yorker , I must say the chicken parm does not even come close to your average pizza shop back home."}
{"text":"Where's the 6-star rating?  Best pizza in Phoenix--maybe on the west coast entirely.    Don't go in expecting to get a smile out of the staff though.  I've been going there for years and they could have no teeth and I wouldn't know it."}
{"text":"I really like the NY-style pizza that Ray's gives ya. I dined in with the yelp $10 for $20 deal and got a Large Monster and it was delicious. The decor was extremely NY. The service was counter style which was down to earth. I will be going back for sure. Less one star because I've had better but this by no means isn't fantastic!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever and the staff is extremely nice I was so happy when I found this place right by my apartment!"}
{"text":"Vendor rays pizza refused to accept offer from phone screen stating they had no bar code reader.  When I payed cash I was not given a receipt and when I asked for one I was told there was no way to print one, but she could write it down for me.  What good is that?"}
{"text":"Totally New York Pizza. We went last night and tried it. It's awesome. We finally found a place that has real pizza. We're from Upstate NY and know good pizza and this is great pizza. We'll be going back again soon."}
{"text":"I am terribly sorry *kinda* for this less then magical review. I have frequented this place some many a' time. I like this place. It's close and tasty. I feel like this is the point of the review I present my uncertainty! Enter sad face. Wife ordered...per super awesome phone thing, a large pep and idk maybe 20 wings. Non the less $30 later I walk in, like I have many times b4, and dude looks at me like I am bothering him. With the secret two digit numerical code my wife relayed to me I was able to get my hands on the order. After acquiring the ordered items I shuffle slowly towards the register. Before 1 1/2 shuffles buddy behind the counter gave me some serious angry eyes asking if I paid! What!! I was obliged to promote their high traffic area and simply moved closer to the point of business where I could pay. Not cool. Insulting and honestly.... Never again. I hope they trained that staff to make sure they never get return business because in that scenario.... Job well done"}
{"text":"As an east coast guy I know a good pie and this is a good pie The rest is of the food is good as well great little mom an pop joint with family ties to real east coast pizza has the feel of every mom an pop shop you miss from east coast"}
{"text":"The pizza is very good, but the service sucks. Dudes working there are really pissy pant types. Like they were doing me a favor making me that pizza and charging almost $20 for a medium veggie."}
{"text":"I come here any time my wife and I are wanting some simple slices. The food is always good and cheap with the slices being huge. I usually order two forgetting just how big they are! I've read a lot of reviews complaining about the service, which I don't get. The workers aren't rude, they always get your order right, and a few times I've gone, they've tossed us some freebies. Will they win a Miss Congeniality pageant? Probably not. Great pizza at a great price? Definitely!"}
{"text":"Five stars on the pizza-its just like NY. Thin, crispy, lots of olive oil- The service could be friendlier though. It gives off a vibe of annoyance and no appreciation.  Ive seen people saying maybe thats how it is in NY but I lived in Brooklyn thirty years and people are actually gregarious and friendly.  The pizza is great here so that's my only complaint but it's important to customers to feel valued."}
{"text":"The owner of this location is a complete cheap . I've been a consistent customer for awhile, and he's never been friendly , never even seen a smile from the guy.  Today I asked for 3 ranches , which he charges 50 cents each for .  I only got 2 ranches. So then I asked for my third ranch from the nice lady behind the counter. The man , tells her I only bought 2. I WAS ALREADY EATING AND PAID FOR MY MEAL, AND THEY STILL CHARGED ME FOR A 3rd ranch.  It's just unbelievable how cheap this dude is, my last time coming here."}
{"text":"Update: Recent full remodel bumps this pizza gem to 5 stars.  Famous Ray's is THE BEST."}
{"text":"Everything is yummy ... especially the Monster Pie! They're not the friendliest guys in town, but that almost adds to the charm of this being a NY-style pizza joint."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great price and doesn't effect my wheat intolerance. I go out of my way to eat at Ray's! You should too"}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance fool you. It was the best pizza I've had yet in Arizona. As a matter of fact, if I was still back home in NY I would go there for a slice - it was that good. It's also cool when servers talk straight like back home, not like you're some kind of puppy or like you're in kindergarten. Didn't have to hear the word \"perfect\" once."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had!\".Staff was friendly, We had the Pizza and Wings special ,also ordered the pizza pie xtra thin Brooklyn style.. It was amazing,for desert the Cannoli was out of.this.world! I will beBACK!"}
{"text":"Staff was so rude and had such bad attitudes. I witnessed them talk down to an elderly couple and when it was my turn to order the girl at the register gave me an attitude because I told her it was my 1st time time there and wanted to know if she recommends anything, she looked at me and said \"Seriously, we don't have the same taste buds\" lol, ok whatever. When we finally got the food the crust was like leather. Not understanding what all the hype is about. This place was horrible from the staff to the food. I have visited the one on 59th ave & Greenway and they were good. This is just a bad location"}
{"text":"This is the best NY style pie in town.  I would give it 5 stars but they don't have free drink refills and the counter person rarely gets off of her cell phone to take your order."}
{"text":"Ray's Pizza was my favorite, came in this afternoon for two slices of sausage and a Coke. Hardly any cheese on the pizza and very little sausage. They Wonder hardly any customers in the restaurant at 1 in the afternoon They don't serve a good product anymore I was going to give only one star with I gave two stars because it was my favorite a couple years ago"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Delicious pie with a crispy crust! Reminded us of our first time eating Rays pizza in NYC!"}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good. Greasy and cheesy which is important to me.  The only things I would change are the service and the pricing. A little too pricey for what they offer and the guys behind the counter have ZERO personality or social skills. They are literally a-holes to everyone."}
{"text":"I eat lunch a lot at Rays. The staff is really friendly and the pizza is delish!"}
{"text":"Love it here! The staff is always friendly and accommodating. I like it that they remember their repeat customers and we are repeats because of the excellent food and service they provide. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is good pizza every time I get it.  I've never eaten in so can't comment on the service but when I go to pick it up it's always ready and the cashiers seem friendly enough."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite pizza place! I alway get the 2 slices with a free soda special. Customer service has always been good for me but my boyfriend said one guy was rude. The restaurant is always clean and the pizza is always the best"}
{"text":"Wow, this place takes me back to my NY childhood and the pizzeria that I used to work in. Very authentic all the way to the accent. Very good NY style pizza and great people that take care of you. We have only had the pizza and mozzarella sticks so far but plan to keep trying other menu items as we go back time and time again. Great find! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Been going here for years. Owners are surly but it feels more New York to me"}
{"text":"Worse \"Ray's\" I've been too! The girl told me that they raise their prices this time of year cuz of pizza. Took over 30 mins to get our food! Worst pizza ever!! It was just sauce and little but of cheese. Plus I had the coupon and so they just added $10 to the price of my food so a pizza and wings was $35 all of a sudden. Horrible food!!!"}
{"text":"Ignore any negative reviews of this place, best pizza in town. Ill be the first to admit I'm a snob about pizza, probably since the majority of my family is from new york, but I drive 25 minutes to come eat here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"In a world of a zillion pizza options, I'm unlikely to be back. Like other reviewers commented, the Pizza was greasy; the white pizza with tomato and spinach was flavorless with sparse toppings. The wings were mediocre. Big slices, though. It would probably be fine for a greasy lunch bite but not worthy of ordering full pies in the future."}
{"text":"Food is always good but this is the third time in a row that the woman working the counter has been completely stone faced and looks like she hates her life.  Also, 2 of the 3 times she's been on personal phone calls during my interaction with her.  Doesn't really change my opinion of the pizza but it's just rude."}
{"text":"Best lasagna I've ever had! And portions are huge! You can tell the family puts work into their food. Definitely New York style food and attitude (which I loved). This place is now my go to for Italian food. Even the loaf of bread was perfectly crispy on the outside and warm and soft inside! I'll be back, very soon!"}
{"text":"Finally, a pizza joint that has good pizza and beef pepperoni! You can't go wrong with that combo."}
{"text":"Not bad for cardboard. On second thought I may have accidentally eaten the box. In all seriousness I would pass and find another place. Pizza was over cooked and had little flavor."}
{"text":"It was my birthday a couple weeks ago, so I figured, what better way to celebrate than with some NY pizza!  Granted, the place was a little out-of-date, sorely in need of a soapy scrubbing and the guy who took my order could have been polite enough to HANG UP THE CELLPHONE while he took my order.  Honestly, I didn't know when he was talking to me or the phone.  Other than that, he was friendly enough, the pizza didn't take long (I stood & waited while it baked), and the order-taker guy helped out an elderly gentleman to order more food for less money (how sweet, right?).  I had my favorite combo: mushroom & onion.  it was greasy, cheesy & just perfect!  The crust was crisp, the pie was hot.  The only thing I could complain about was I did have a couple of onionskin pieces on the pizza.    Overall, tasty slices & I'd be pleased to enjoy another pizza, but I might order beforehand."}
{"text":"I ordered one slice of pizza and garlic bread..   The slice of pizza I had was so soggy I couldn't even finish it. Absolutely disgusting. It was falling apart.   They seem to take the literal Sense of garlic bread.. they put about 20 cloves of fresh garlic on my bread. I tasted nothing but garlic. It was literally garlic with a bit of bread and butter. Not bread with some garlic. I had to clean off all the garlic they put on the bread.. still didn't taste right so I ended up paying almost $9 for nothing. I threw it all out, because none of it was edible.   I will never come here again, and never suggest this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Pretty decent pizza by the slice.  Also a pretty good bargain.  I always want a chicken alfredo slice, and usually a pepperoni or sausage slice.  Good-sized slices."}
{"text":"-5!!! This place is absolutely horrible their white pizza is a joke, wouldn't even feed it to my dog! And then when I called to see if they would at least exchange it they said it wasn't their problem purchases are as is. The worst customer service I have received in a long time, 15 dollars for a pizza that isn't even worthy as dog food is ridiculous!!! Definitely do not recommend the food or service to anyone...Buyer Beware"}
{"text":"I loved it, my husband didn't prefer it. I thought the cheese to sauce ratio was spot on and the prices are great. Thanks for the yummy pizza!"}
{"text":"The only reason to come here is if your too lazy to cook a frozen pizza. Terible ingredients make terible pizzas and thats what happened here. Prices are pretty high but ill pay for a good NY slice. Came in place was empty during lunch time, I wonder why. Well at first look the all the pizza started off as alrrady made cheese pizza and they threw the toppings on right out of the refrigerator then re heated it for you. The peperoni lookied like it was bought from the grocerystore in the prepackaged lunch meat bag from tostinos or where ever. The pizza had a weird taste for some odd reason. The small soda was probably 12 ozs for $1.50 go with water. Terrible just terrible."}
{"text":"Awesome spot! My kinda place. Very down-to-earth small hole in the wall. Food looks and smells great!"}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza! Excellent food. I highly recommend it. New York style pizza. The best pizza in this area by a long shot!"}
{"text":"I am only giving a one-star review because a selection is required. I will never order from this location again and neither should you!  I ordered five extra large pizzas of different variety and found a thin metal screw in one of the pizzas. I am not even sure that this is a screw or a piece of broken metal from some machinery used during the preparation of the pizzas. I cannot believe it. The screw was literally cooked into the pizza. Disgusting! Finding a screw in one pizza made me extremely apprehensive about the other four pizzas. Had I or anyone else swallowed the screw it could have caused serious internal damage. That's how sharp the metal screw is. If I can attach a picture, I will.   To make matters worse, I called and was told there was nothing they would do other than re-make the pizza. Why would I want a new pizza to find more metal cooked into it? After being told they would not refund me, the person I was speaking with proceeded to tell me that they don't use metal in their kitchen and that he has no clue how the metal got in the pizza. They refuse to take accountability or at least show concern that this metal was found in my food. His exact words were \"come back on Monday and MAYBE someone else will be able to help.\" Absolutely unbelievable!   Do not order from this location because they clearly don't care about our health. If I found a sharp metal screw in my pizza, I wonder what else goes overlooked in other pizzas. Thankfully, we found the screw before ingesting it. I'm so grateful none of the kids had this pizza!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza whenever I am willing to spend a little extra and make the drive I certainly come here for their New York style pizza. The white pizza Is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"After hitting up several pizza joints in the area, I finally found my go-to when I'm craving NY style pizza!  I just moved here a couple months ago from NJ where there's a pizza shop on every block and this was the closest one in quality to the ones back home.  The crust folded well  in my hands and the cheese pulled apart like the way mozarella should!  Their Chicken Parm sandwich was very tasty as well though not as good as the ones back home. The staff was very friendly and though prices are okay it's still not the same for some reason.  Maybe its the water? But overall, this is my spot for NY Pizza!  Give me Benny Tudinos in Hoboken, NJ anytime!!!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is great and the sicillian is the best, their service is not the best though! i would recommend, but understand if you ask for extra sauce or extra anything you won't get a smile"}
{"text":"Great pizza use their yelp coupon it worked out great . Also had the meatball they were good too!"}
{"text":"Okay, I've upped them a star because I heard through the grapevine that they've repainted and refreshed their interior. Hmmm... did someone tell them about my review?!"}
{"text":"It's good but not as good as the Ray's located on Greenway. Which is some of the best Pizza in the Valley."}
{"text":"The service was mediocre at best, and unfriendly. The pizza is far from famous. I ordered a slice of pepperoni to go and my order was placed on a paper plates and the placed in a paper bag with no other covering. By the time I drove 2 mikes back to my destination it was cold and tasted as if it were previously frozen.. Will not be returning here..."}
{"text":"I have been craving New York pizza & am soooo happy I found this place!! Everyone was extremely friendly & welcoming. The lady at the register who had just flew in from NY was my favorite, I enjoyed conversating with her. I purchased the $10 for $20 deal on YELP & tried getting the special large cheese pizza with 20 wings for $20.95 but the owner said it wasn't valid with my coupon, that was the only thing I didn't like. Pizza is HUGE, garlic bread & wings are amazing & fullfilled my craving! I will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome, like being in New York.  This place is a little pricy, especially with toppings. Worth the price if you like good pizza."}
{"text":"I go to another's rays pizza because every time I come here customer service is terrible and the servers and cashier aren't very nice"}
{"text":"My go to place for pizza in this area. I usually get the pizza & wings special but stop in once in a while for just 2 slices. The pizza is cooked just right, not too greasy. Plenty of pizza options and a great selection of other italian dishes. Good prices. Friendly service."}
{"text":"This is simple, straight-forward NY pizza done right. Do take-out instead of dining-in because the dining area is just an afterthought.  Also, don't let the cashier's New York attitude scare you off, the pizza is worth it. Wings aren't bad either."}
{"text":"I ordered a large half greek half cheese pizza and a large garlic knots from this place last night: - garlic knots were tasteless: literally bread with garlic thrown in the box. Nothing tasting like garlic knots. - the worst is the pizza: first, the toppings are not what was mentionned in the menu. The Greek pizza doesn't include peperocini. Also, it was missing tomotoes. The worst part, that the toppings weren't even coocked. They were thrown over an old, probably misdelivered cheese pizza. I'm new to the area, but I have 9 years of pizza experience and that's why I promote family owned spots, but this was simply disgusting. At this point, it doesn't matter how good the crust is, because simply what they did was disrespectful and unethical. Never ever again!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza! New York style! Their wings are good as well. They do have specials(deals). My favorite is sausage & chs. My sister loves pepperoni pizza. You can definitely taste this pizza is like homemade & it's super good. My little sister & cousin love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try out this pizza joint once we moved into this area but on the other hand I was also hearing mixed reviews, so I just went on with my gut instinct. So so glad I did being that I was born & raised on Long Island & my first job was in a New York pizzeria Giancarlo's Restaurant to be exact, therefore I know a thing or two about authentic NY pizza not the wanna be NY pizza. All I can say is this is the real deal & if you say otherwise well you need to learn a thing or two about NY pizza. Yes New York pizza can be a little greasy & if you're from New York you know to fold the pizza as you're eating it & the extra grease from the good cheese drips onto your white paper plates & only the white paper plates!! Real New Yorkers know their pizza like real Philly people know their cheesesteaks & real Jersey boys know the true fist pump, lol!! So you haters out there that wanna knock down this place first let's look at your place of birth & then make your judgement call or just stick to your Pizza Hut, lol!! FYI Yelp is all about opinions, it's nothing personal!!"}
{"text":"After a long day of travel - didn't feel like a dine-in....I grabbed a pizza from Rays!  I walked in and ordered, had a 20 minute wait for the pizza.  It was worth it!  Great pizza at a fair price!"}
{"text":"Aggressive customer service Dry, no meat-chicken wings  Sticky, tough pizza  Dirty environment  Grumpy creepy employees  Sketchy place  Again, terrible customer service"}
{"text":"First time at Famous Ray's Pizza but I didn't order a pizza. For a Friday lunch, the two of us got a Philly Cheesesteak and six wings each.   Our lunch was done in about 8 mins. The sandwich was okay but with Jersey Mikes next door it didn't compare. The wings were good though. Just enough crunch, saucy and cooked perfectly. I like the wings at Streets of New York, around the corner, so I doubt if I'll be coming back. Maybe the pizza is better?"}
{"text":"Got the turkey and cheese sub.  The meat in it was not turkey.   I don't even know what it was.   It had holes throughout and had the consistency of some disgusting canned meat.   Almost like dog food.  Wish I would have taken a pic.   Apparently it must be cheap and that's why they use it.   Judging from the other reviews, don't go here!"}
{"text":"Where do o even start? I guess I'll start when you first walk in. It's EVERYTHING NY pride! LOVE IT!!!  Being from NJ and living there for 17 years, I miss the east coast authentic pizza as well as cheese steaks. I CRAVE good pizza and cheese steaks almost every week!  This is run by the original Rays Famous Pizza family.  I feel like I get every dollars worth of food here. Is GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"Wings are amazing! The pizza is pretty decent, but could use better cheese. The cheese separates instead of stretches. The atmosphere is NY feeling and so are the people who work there."}
{"text":"I give it a -1 they suck, I'm sorry they do, i heard so much about it from my friend's and then I go and watch them take an already made pizza and stick toppings on it, it was super soggy, and tasteless, congrats you buy 2 slices and get a free drink but it isn't worth it. They should really just stop. But because people like the workers there, they just think the pizza is to die for and it's not, you just like the people and the junk on the wall....."}
{"text":"Calm and friendly place where you won't get deaf from the music and can have a good time with friends and family. Pizza is yummy  haven't tried other meals yet."}
{"text":"If you are buying slices, cheese is good. Anything else sucks. They get the slice from the cheese pizza sitting there (mine was old), added 4 toppings and warmed up. All toppings, including onions were raw, cheese was dry and pizza overcookrd. I paid 10 bucks for 2 slices. It tasted horrible. I will never come back! I saw really good reviews if you buy a whole pizza, and it make sense, since they probably prepare the pizza properly.  SLICES, NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Truly great pizza!!  but I don't know why yelp has a single \"$\" for this place?  It should be \"$$$\" Expensive pizza when compared to competitors, of which there are many... Sure the Pizza is better... but they are pricing themselves to be the \"special occasion\" pizza option...  I would love to order here about once a week instead of a few times a year when I want delicious pizza.   Between Papa Johns and Pizza Hut both offering 50% off deals quite often... it's very rare that Ray's Pizza seems like a good purchasing decision for pizza, despite how good it is.  Ray's-- be proud of your pizza but price them within reality.  Of the few times I've ordered from here, it's never anywhere near as busy as other places. I think that says something, and it's not because of the food.  Fix your prices!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, fantastic wings and great service. I always order my wings with extra sauce so they reheat in the oven without becoming too dry. With the local chain I used to order from switching their ingredients to cheaper ones and changing over to fastrack ovens, Ray's will be my go-to place from here on out."}
{"text":"This pizza has been the Best Pizza I've ever had so far since moving to AZ last year!!! I ordered it extra thin and well done! When I took that first bite I literally had visions of my old pizzerias back in NYC! Right amount of crust, bread, cheese, sauce and grease!!! Just delicious! I highly recommend this place if you want real NY style pizza!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Famous Ray's to split an Italian sausage sandwich before we headed home. Not the best I've had, but still worth stopping for."}
{"text":"We order from here often. Today we went in to pick up four pizzas for a total of $64. I asked if we could get ten plates for our daughters birthday party. You know, the round white ones that are so flimsy you can't put much weight on them. They said no!  10 paper plates?  No?  WTF.  These things can't be more than a few pennies each. We are done with this place. What crappy service. I had to go to get my own plates, which by the way cost me less than a dollar for 20.  What a silly way to lose a customer."}
{"text":"LOVE this pizza place.  It is so hard to find a place that has crispy (not floppy) pizza.  I worked across the street and frequented this place at least once a week.  I miss it dearly since I no longer work over there.  Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in the valley! I have been eating their pizza for years, though not very often as it's not close to home. The pizza is SO amazingly delicious, it's worth the drive!!! We don't often eat in the store, but have once or twice and the atmosphere was nice. I recommend this pizza all the time, go get your Ray's today!"}
{"text":"Walked in here one night randomly spoke to the owner and he hooked me up on a pizza. It was really good, the sauce is really tasty. I would def come back."}
{"text":"good place to have authentic new york style pizza! a bit pricy for everyday eating but worth to try."}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty good; although I personally prefer a more crispy crust. I was impressed that the large pizza we ordered barely fit in the pizza box so for the price the size is good. I had heard the service here wasn't very good so we decided to get it to go to avoid any service issues. My order was ready in 15 mins. and the girls at the counter were nice. I'll try this place again I'm sure."}
{"text":"This is the BEST PIZZA I've had here in Phoenix, seriously out of this world.  The neopolitan/new york style is amazing, the cheese is nice and gooey, the crust is nice and chewy, and the bottom of the pizza is slightly crunchy.  The sauce they use is perfect, sweet but just enough. I seriously cannot say enough about how great this place is.    When my boyfriend called to place an order for pickup he took too long and got hung up on, with a curt \"We're busy, your pizza will be ready in 20\" in true New York style.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Great pizza ...its Tasty and the wings are awesome too. They always mix the bbq and buffalo sauce for me which I love. Rays pizza, my new favorite joint!"}
{"text":"If you're from NYC (like me), and you're looking for a good slice, then you should try Ray's.  I've been to a couple of Ray's around PHX, and they are consistently good... at least as good as you're gonna get if you're looking for a pizzeria style slice- not fancy schmancy or thin crust or some other non NYC authentic corner pizza.  Perfect cheese to sauce ratio for my taste.  And good bbq wings.  I recommend ordering a pie on your way home from work, and get it to go to enjoy at home."}
{"text":"The pizza was great!   We were here for lunch and this seems to be  primarily a 'serve by the slice' kind of joint for the lunch crowd. We had a group of five hungry people so we ordered 2 medium pizzas and had a seat.   Our rushed and uneducated decision was the meat lovers pizza and the vegetarian.  We lucked out! Both were amazing. It is a great New York style pizza crust. Great balance of crunch and chew.   Minus one star because the house salad was extremely disappointing. It was a head of iceberg lettuce with two black olives, two green olives and two croutons. In the bottom of the plate there was a crouton destroying puddle of water from rinsing the lettuce right before service.   If I ever find myself in this city again I'll swing by for a slice."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town hands down!! Straight from NY you know the one thing you need to have is a slice. Thanks to this location for making pizza so authentic you forget you left NY. Always can count on the great customer service and great food.   Thank you for being one of our favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Ray's was pretty good. We went a little early so the \"by the slice\" selection wasn't great but the pizza was good. I'd eat eat there again."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered the Sicilian pizza, and as soon as we came home we noticed that the pizza was doughy, and the pizza was thin crust. The Sicilian is normally thick, but this wasn't so we called the owner about the pizza and he says, \"oh, I didn't use enough yeast and I noticed that when I took it out of the oven.\" We asked for our money back, but they said that they wouldn't do that, but we could drive all the way back and make us another pizza. We didn't want another pizza. We ended up throwing away the food because it was uncooked. What a waste of $20.00, and we are never coming back. That's not how you do business. I wish I could give this review negative stars because of the owners response."}
{"text":"Its good pizza when your in the mood for new york pizza, for example streets of new york pizza tastes NOTHING like new york pizza!  They should honestly give it up and just sell wings and pasta because thats all they have going but we are talking about Rays so im gonna stop plugging Streets.  Anyway the pizza is good for quick and tasty new york pizza this being said the \"soup nazi\" that runs it scares the living daylights out of me and makes me uncomfortable limiting my trips.  I thought i would avoid his creepyness by ordering take out but he denied me to go parmesan and red pepper packets then proceeded to stack the pieces on top of each other which was lovely, so basically if the customer services was at least par they would get 4 stars from me :) Btw this has happened several times other employees will give me packets and stack the pizza correctly just not the mean guy so they are all \"good people!\""}
{"text":"Got the chicken parm.  My favorite food, so I'm very picky with it.  Definitely one of the best I ever ate.  I'm a DC guy in AZ, recently from ATX, they really need to consider opening a spot up in ATX, there is ZERO NY style pizza/subs there.  Very good food!  F the Mets and Giants though, GO Nats and Skins!!!!"}
{"text":"The owners are funny, and very nice. Great calzone!! Thing was huge and delicious!! The pizza by the slice was average I will get the calzone again when I go back!!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this awesome place!  Walk in and it feels like Im back in NY!  The pizza is great.  The people are just like typical new yorkers!  Love it!!  You have to try the garlic knots...smothered in fresh garlic and olive oil..YUM!!!"}
{"text":"To the blind old man who doesn't know the difference between mushroom and pepperoni, thanks for making me wait 10 minutes and then reading off my exact order and giving me the wrong food. I guess I should have checked before I left but damn dude, huge difference between mushrooms and pepperoni."}
{"text":"Great place to go for some really fantastic N.Y. pizza. We've been visiting this location for years and nothing from the friendly New York greeting to the taste of the pizza ever changes. If you get the chance, drop in and grab a slice!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this pizza, not the best in phoenix but definitely not the worst. Would have given 5 stars on taste but the parking lot is insane, it took me 10 minutes to find a spot and even then I just gave up and parked against a curb. Oh and the XL pizza is truly huge, it fed my family of 5 and I still had leftovers. I will order again just maybe deliver next time."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since the 90s and I have to say famous Rays New York style pizza makes the best Chicago style pizza I had. We always order the Sicilian monster, this beast comes out looking like a baked lasagna with a crust. It has the same weight of 3 New York pizzas. With my family of four, we always have trouble finishing just half of it. There is some New York attitude there but the pizza is so good just let them roll into that stereotype and enjoy."}
{"text":"New York ghetto feel in a strip mall but delicious pizza!!!! Not oily and crunchy thin crust with plenty of toppings if you want. We ordered a large with jalopenos, mushroom, and sausage. Nom nom."}
{"text":"The pizza here rocks! Malley, a traditional New Yorker oversees the production. Awesome crust and they use the right cheese and process so that your cheese never slides off of your pizza.  The walls are filled with New York memorabilia for those missing home. Clean and comfortable with a TV to catch all the sports. The cast of employees all talk in that \"Yo Rocky\" inflection. So, it is fun to hear the conversation. Recommended for the pizza fan. #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"Honestly I don't know what all the fuss is about for this place, it is just OK and nothing special."}
{"text":"Doesn't taste anything like a New York pizza so I will rate how this compares to other pizza places around town.  Service was neither friendly nor rude.  Just matter of fact.  We ordered the Monster Pie.  My brother and I thought the taste was 3 out of 5.  Price is a little expensive but they give you a lot of meat.  Several hours after eating this pizza, I felt like crap.  Much the same feeling when I eat pizza made from cheap ingredients like a few national pizza chains do.  I would rate many of the national pizza chains 2/5 stars as well.  The next day, I reheated the leftovers in a pizza stone.  And again, several hours after eating, feel like crap again.  I don't like eating cheap food.  I've sampled some good pizza on pizza tours in Chicago and used to live in New York and I would say this is not even close to good pizza."}
{"text":"Great food!  Great pizza! Wings are best I've had in Phoenix by a long shot.   Smaller family like atmosphere with friendly service.  You can't go wrong with Ray's."}
{"text":"poor customer service, no manners, unhelpful. go to the one on bell or union hills."}
{"text":"I'm from New York City, and it was really hard to find a pizza here that taste like in New York, and this place did . I tried a lot of pizzerias in Arizona but nothing can compare to this place I really like coming here.and I think this is the only pizzeria that carry Sicilian slice"}
{"text":"This is the real deal. If you want real NY pizza, it ain't gonna get any closer than this!"}
{"text":"Always come here on our yearly vacation in Phoenix. This place is the great. The pizza is definitely authentic New York style. They also have good Yelp offers too."}
{"text":"It is exactly what it should be, a classic ny style pizza joint that gives you foldable giant slices. Being from NY/NJ area, I like pizza...a lot...in ALL its forms, but there is a certain way NY style take a pie home type of pizza should be. This place does a great job with that. You aren't going to get the artisan super bubble crusted personal sized pizzas like from Doughbird or Motorino NY. You get classic thin crust, crispy chewy slices that aren't too greasy but are greasy enough to make you happy. I plan to make this a regular go to place for pizza night at home."}
{"text":"Just moved from NY to Arizona and was craving an authentic slice of pizza.  My expectations were not high after having a bad experience at a \"NY Style\" pizza shop the day before. I knew I was in the right place when we ordered a slice and there was no hesitation or question about it.  This is pizza is the real deal!  It has the right proportion of cheese and sauce to crust and tastes just like a slice from any parlor in NYC.  I had a slice there and ordered another slice to take home.  Best believe I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in AZ. Best pizza I've ever had. And the place is awesome. I love the New York feel and the workers were some of the dopest people in the world. You could tell if they were given attitude they couldn't give any flying bananas about it. I recommend the cheese pizza. Pepperoni is pretty good too, but the mushrooms are trash in my opinion. Family likes them tho. I'm very very picky. But all in all, great food!"}
{"text":"The pizza, to die for! The sauce is perfectly spiced, the crust, especially when they throw a slice in the oven for you to re heat quickly, crisp and yummy.. This is my idea of pizza heaven. They place is a little shabby, and the people running the joint a little aloof and kinda like they are from another planet, but the pizza is really good. If you are ordering for carry out, call a bit more ahead than you want, I have never not had to wait while picking up the pizza..I am not a fan of the steak sandwich, skip that one. Go for the pizza!"}
{"text":"So much closer to authentic Italian/American cooking. The sauce was good, very good. The dough was a little old, which made it a little chewy...., but that didn't take away from the overall pizzaee goodness much.     I had a pepperoni, extra mushroom pizza and they piled on the mushrooms. It was such a relief to find a pizza place in Phoenix that resembles a good old fashioned NY pizza parlor. I will be back and am still searching for the best pizza, which hopefully I will find someday, then I can die a happy man. lol"}
{"text":"2 slices of pizza with a free drink for lunch.   I got a white pizza with some red sauce on top. It is the perfect mixture of flavors. I also go the ham and green peppers. The peppers are better suited for the sausage and peppers sandwich. I do not like them on the pizza.   The crust has a nice chewy consistency and a good flavor.   The service is fun, the place is clean. Price's are great!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza and fast. I love the crust on this pizza and the wings are awesome. They have a really good lunch special as well. One of my fav quick stops for a bit to eat."}
{"text":"Rays is one of the best pizza joints around...but what is not cool is them charging me for ranch...and I pretty much own stock in the company..that's how often I'm there...but nonetheless ..good greasy pizza!"}
{"text":"Two lunch specials: a slice of pizza with one topping each and side salads, total $10.38!  Love the pizza!  I always get pepperoni but the others look great too. (would like there to be more pepperoni on the pizza tho, my preference).  The small side salad is fresh, with iceberg lettuce, a slice of tomato, and an olive and the italian salad dressing is lovely.  Restaurant is clean and comfortable with a pleasant atmosphere and the order-at-the-counter service is fast."}
{"text":"Ray's is a greasy-pizza lover's wet dream.  Be sure to plan your dieting around this place as you are sure to have higher cholesterol when leaving!!! :)"}
{"text":"So before we dove into the rice pudding last night, I thought we should eat something with some more substance and nutrition... and although I'm not the biggest pizza fan, I swear I've heard somewhere that pizza is considered the perfect balanced meal!  I did make a spinach salad to go along with it, but calling ahead to Ray's was quick and easy.  We ordered one large Sicilian cheese pizza (actually, Jared ordered it this way - I would've ordered some fun toppings but oh well) for the four of us to share.  Turns out it was plenty... One piece was just enough for me - they are big slices and even with the guys eating two slices each, there were a couple leftover slices too!  Ray's was pretty impressive - if you like a little bit of grease on the pizza, Ray's delivers just that... I followed my friend's lead and blotted it a bit with a napkin before diving in and devouring my slice.  I would 100% take out from Ray's again... it was reasonably priced ($16.50 for a large - actually, that may be a bit pricey for pizza but since I don't eat it very often, I am kind of clueless); it travels well, and I bet leftovers are just as good if not better - actually, I'll find out today when I have them for lunch!"}
{"text":"Service here has IMPROVED over the years!    I recommend getting plain cheese slices if you want to enjoy the taste of a New York style pie.  Wings are not bad at all and worth a try.  No delivery.  However, I feel that the lack of delivery adds to the charm and overall fun of Rays."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza spot!! Authentic NY pizza. Reminds me of back east for sure. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst race piece I've ever been to my life I will never go back there bathrooms are locked the cheese taste like shit I left the pizza on the counter and walked out my son said it was disgusting it did even chase like cheese. I can see where the rating so damn low disgusting it would not unlock the bathroom the whole time I was in there. I think they really suck"}
{"text":"The pizza = amazing. Loved the thin crust. Wings were top-notch. Also ordered a philly and it was very disappointing. No flavor. Dry steak. WAY too much mushrooms and onions. Every bite was smothered in it. Service was eh. They seemed like they really didn't care whether you enjoyed your time or not. Probably won't do again."}
{"text":"It's been a NY minute since visiting this neighborhood gem and it was long overdue! The NY style pizza with pepperoni complimented with the mild chicken wings was exactly was we were craving for a football filled weekend! The flavors of the cheese and pepperoni cut is like no other and being a New Yorker I can appreciate these things when it come to eating some good old fashion pizza!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to get pizza! Always fast, friendly service, and the food as never disappointed. The white pizza is to die for"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to grab pizza. Perfect NY style pizza you fold in half to eat. My heart!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time and wasn't overly impressed.  For whatever reason restaurants in the Valley tend to be a bit on the salty side and Ray's was no exception.  I had their pizza and wing combo special. Pizza was pretty good, nice crunchy crust, baked perfectly. The sausage and pepperoni was very good, but pepperoni was salty. And just the right amount of red sauce. But the cheese wasn't very cheesy and could've used a bit more mozzarella. The wings were not very good. They were very dry, almost like it was reheated from yesterday's batch. And they were salty as hell. And to make it worse, the hot and medium hot sauce (which wasn't tossed all over the wings) were even more salty.   If I were to ever go back it would be to try their lasagna and their meat pies, but never again for their pizza or wings... Too many better options in the valley."}
{"text":"ALWAYS GREAT NY PIZZA! The original Ray's and still the best! Calzones, sicilians, wings, you name it! You'll feel like you just stepped off the number 2 train and landed in NYC."}
{"text":"Let me just start out by saying, this is NOT the review I would like to be writing. I'll admit, this is not my first time here but it certainly will be my last. I live basically hop, skip, and a jump away and this would be way too convenient for my ultimate craving (which, yes, happens daily ;) I stopped in for dinner around 7:30 and there is one cheese pizza sitting under the lamp for god knows how long. From a previous trip I remember there being about 6-7 specialty pizzas ready to take a slice and be on your way. Specialty pizzas are my thing. You would NEVER, I repeat NEVER, catch me ordering a cheese or even pepperoni pizza. There is just way more to life than to be plain Jane like that! So the dull toned lady tells me that it's $2.50/slice and an additional $0.50/topping. I should have to just politely said no thank you but I was set on pizza for dinner so I ordered chicken, spinach and mushrooms which the man takes the cheese slice that had been under the lamp for unsaid amount of time, adds the topping and puts in back in the oven. I will eat pizza hot, cold, reheated, etc but to have my pizza cooked a second time as I'm ordering it is just not my idea of deliciousness! So if I cant finish it, I am then triple heating my pizza?!? No thank you! Customer service was not there. Reheated, over priced pizza. Like I said, I really wanted to like, or love, this place but that's just not the case. I guess I'll be heading to the grocery store for a whole frozen pizza for about the same price and about 100000x more satisfaction! Sigh!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and fantastic selection of Italian food. Prices are wonderful as well."}
{"text":"A co-worker of mine had recommended this place to me for a good slice of pizza. Especially for the lunch special because of the price. I was over all satisfied with my pizza. It was freshly made and tasted great. The cashier and server were also nice. You can also tell the employees here are very friendly. The only downside for me was the container that holds the red peppers. I love adding spice to any pizza I eat, but the thought of shaking the dusty container over my food was a bit of a turn off. Other than that over all good."}
{"text":"Probably the worst customer service in the world. The owner is always angry and he act like he's doing you a favor by taking your money. The pizza is usually super greasy but I don't even want to talk about the food, I just can't believe how rude this guy is. He never ever says thank you or anything at all other than \"what do you want\" and the price. I think he's Albanian (judging by the flag on the walk) he does some dirty business in the back. My brother and I noticed few times some guys going in the back with duffle bags and leaving after like 5-10 minutes with different bags. There is something dirty going on here I guarantee it, I think they are using this business as a smoke screen for money laundering. I will never go there again for as long as I live!!!!"}
{"text":"What more can I say.  Nice staff coupled with the best New York Style pizza in town, I say that's a match made in heaven.  This restaurant deserves 6 stars!"}
{"text":"OMG this place is amazing!. The best place to go when you have a urge for some amazing east coast style pizza the crust is always great when I go here the employees have the new york style feel every time you go here they treat you like family .I would recommend this place to everyone in the valley. The chicken wings are by far the best wings I have ever had......"}
{"text":"Eh. It's mediocre. Too greasy . But the wings were excellent.  Maybe I'll try it again."}
{"text":"i feel like ray's is a little more pricey than other similar pizza joints, but i rarely care. g and i have a little joke about how long it will take for takeout ... no matter what time we call they tell me the pizza will be ready in 10-15 minutes - and they've never lied! it doesn't matter if it is the super bowl, friday night at 7 or sunday at 2, your pizza will be ready in 10-15 minutes. i think it is because they don't deliver. the pizza is huge, a bit greasy, and very tasty. it isn't quite new york pizza, but it is pretty darn close. this is a family run business - you can see dad, his daughters and maybe some other family members (cousins?) when you pick up ... i like that. and the girls and dad are sweet!  if they're not busy, dad can tell stories about the country he grew up in that would blow your mind. they're a sweet family living the american dream, and they make a tasty pizza. yay ray's!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place until today! We ordered a thick crust Sicilian pizza and got a thin crust uncooked doughy pizza. I called and spoke with the owner and his response was that he must not of put enough yeast in dough. Knowing it wasn't cooked properly he still let me walk out with it and wouldn't give me my money back even though we couldn't eat it. Awful business manner!!"}
{"text":"I like Rays pizza not only is it NY style but it's perfectly cooked and not soggy. It's easy to order for pickup or dine in.  Our favorite is the white pizza. Very flavorful and does not require anything else added to it. The garlic bread is also very good and I would say this is our go to place for authentic NY style. The prices are reasonable and the service is always good. A plus is they sell slices also and have small individual sizes as well."}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get and the food was not good. We had a large dinner salad, a sub and two drinks and it was more than $18. The salad was iceberg lettuce with 4 olives and a couple tomatoes. The sub was ok, but we had to take the salami off because it was awful. Very disappointed for the price especially.  The pizza by the slice looked old, albeit it was 3:00 so not a rush period but I didn't order it since it looked so old and crusty. Will not return here!"}
{"text":"Ray's is the closest pizza place from my new home in north Phoenix and I dig it.  Their style of pizza reminds me of my neighborhood pizza place where I grew up in New Jersey.  I usually just go with a plain cheese pizza at Ray's and add on the spices, like black and red pepper, oregano, and garlic.  I usually go in for the two slices and a soda lunch special.  Ray's Pizza: It's cheesy, it's greasy, it's delicious.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Good place to get a slice. Family run business. They also have some specials with salad and a drink! Add toppings on a slice and its a little more. Parmesan, Oregano, Red Pepper Shakes readily available."}
{"text":"We are visiting here for the holidays this is the best pizza we have had since we moved from New York 20 yrs ago!! We have been going here for a slice everyday for a month! Then one day we ordered a meatball sub wow!! So good!! You gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"It's nearly impossible to get real east coast pizza in Arizona, but this place comes very close to a pie from New York or New Jersey. It's the best pizza I've had in Phoenix, hands down."}
{"text":"I grew up in New York and Pennsylvania, then I moved here in 1993. I searched the valley for good New York style pizza, and this place is by far the best! The flavor of the sauce is outstanding, their crust is thin and has a slight crunch to it. I'm happy every time I go to get my fix. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Ray's is the closest you're going to get to real NYC slices in PHX. I lived in NYC for 10 years and got addicted to large, foldable, just-sloppy-enough slices. Though I usually neglected the Ray's chains of questionable origin and quality in Manhattan in favor of other joints I liked better, finding Ray's in North Phoenix was an epiphany. If you're a New Yorker looking for a taste of home Ray's in North Phx will take you there."}
{"text":"Great pizza and friendly staff!  I got the yelp deal of $10 for $20 and got a large thin stye pizza with 3 toppings for just a couple bucks out of pocket, with plenty to take home.  Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Again, see my other reviews: the only good Ray's left is at 59th Ave.  This Ray's, at 3rd and Bell, is more unfriendly, less choices than all the others combined.     I'd rather go hungry than to bother the fat/rude cook who didn't have time to sell me a piece of pizza.  Wait, what?  Isn't that the whole point here?  To sell pizza?  Damn right.  You woulda thought I asked him to sleep with his daughter...or use his bathroom.  Either way, he was a big jerk, I got no pizza pie and I realized the Ray's chain/association or whatever it once was is no more.    Ray's at 59th Avenue is the only Ray's left that's worth it."}
{"text":"BEWARE! I walked in to pick up my takeout order expecting to pay $16.99 and was charged $23.00 plus tax. When I questioned the cashier he explained the \"on-line menu was not accurate\" as it had been \"posted by someone else\" and they had \"not been able to update it.\"   In addition, the pizza had a distinctly bitter burnt-broccoli taste.  Too bad, because the crust was excellent.  This Philly girl - new to North Phoenix - will be looking for someplace else for her next carry-out pie."}
{"text":"It was what I expected of a New York Pizza. Thin, floppy crust, adequate sized toppings. A-OK in my book."}
{"text":"Ray's pizza is simple and unassuming. You're going to get big greasy pizza, which feels good to eat, and really, it's very NY.  My only issue is that when I want hot wings, I expect them be at least tangy.  Good prices, fast speed, and overall , a delicious pie."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Nothing fancy, just good New York style pizza and wings. Good prices and it's always consistent and good."}
{"text":"Ordered and picked up two pizza's tonight, asked for extra sauce on them. No extra sauce on either and didn't get much cheese on one of them that was suppose to be half cheese half sausage. Called and spoke to Saba the manager and he said it was my fault for ordering extra sauce, \"the cheese sucked up the sauce\". What?! Refused to replace. Never had this problem before. Not worth $45 I spent for two pizza's."}
{"text":"Best NY pizza - consistently good. Always tastes better extra crispy or warmed up."}
{"text":"I LOVE Ray's Pizza.  When I'm in the mood for a slice, I like the pepperoni and cheese pizza.  It's a New York style slice that's cheesy and greasy.  I can't always have this type of pizza, but when I do, it's delicious.  They also have great lunch specials, including a slice or two with a soda.    The place is a decent size, has lots of booths and a tv.  The service is always good!"}
{"text":"Ray's Pizza has become a bit of a running joke over the years. It's sort of like the 'Bertos of Mexican Food. The places all appear to be connected, despite having different ownership and quality that varies greatly based on the location.  I'm not entirely sure why I swung by here, as my pizza pickiness has become increasingly worse over the last few years. I blame this primarily on all of the spectacular pizza places found in Central Phoenix.  New York-styled pizza is fine for a quick fix. Admittedly, it's never been my favorite, although sometimes it manages to surprise me as being respectable by Phoenix standards (a la NYPD). Plus, I have a list of legendary New York pizzerias that I hope to one day try. Unfortunately, if you're looking for quality, look harder!  I ordered two slices of pepperoni to go. Pizza slices are $2.50 to start with fifty cents added per topping, so my total came to a little over six bucks. As another reviewer stated, this is basically only good if you're too lazy to bake a frozen pizza yourself.   After a ten-minute drive home, the bottom of the box was heavily soaked in grease, which is obviously a bad sign. A can handle a little bit of grease, but when it's noticeable, it's painfully obvious that the culprit is from subpar ingredients. This is pretty low-end stuff, not any different than what can be obtained at a gas station.  If you're really just craving pizza to shove into your mouth, then by all means, stop by and order a slice. But if you're expecting something more memorable, this definitely isn't the place to go."}
{"text":"I have been going to Ray's Pizza for almost 20 years. It is a solid dependable place for yummy, thin crust New York style pizza. I am especially fond of their mushroom pizza. Yes, the mushrooms are canned and I usually detest canned food but they season them beautifully. Very reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"As good as advertised.  Stopped in for lunch and I really enjoyed it.  Staff was friendly and service was fast.  Got 2 slices and drink. Good pizza and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"anytime when a pizza place goes the extra mile to decorate its interior, that deserves extra star.  plus the food's good too but really recommend the salt n pepper wings.  even invited me inside the kitchen too, makes his own herbs n spices for his dough too.  sprinkled some fresh lemon juice over the wings for that goodness.  back to the decor, it's a flashback to the elvis years and when it was called coca cola collectibles, plus plenty of fedoras around; in fact the owner still wears one, he's hilarious.  It's in the burbs so no where near a trendy area nor its plaza can be said much either so for sure it's a standout here."}
{"text":"Place is the best pizza in arizona, there so nice there too. If ur getting dominos ur an idiot, use the coupon and get a real pizza"}
{"text":"Our first time here and it's really good! The Pizza was fresh and the wings were so good! Gonna come back again when I'm back in the valley."}
{"text":"Love this corner pizza joint!  Crust to cheese to sauce ratio is perfection.  Their wings are good too!  I often get their large pizza and 20 wing special for $22 bucks.  Service is good enough.  They are always busy."}
{"text":"We Calgarians do not suffer from want of pizza. It's easily available everywhere. Some however, like Famous Ray's are gloriously and deliciously unique.  The first thing you'll notice upon entering Famous Ray's is it's character. The walls are covered in retro beer signs (Schlitz, Coors) and there are vintage books and magazines scattered around, as are honest-to-god vinyl 7-inch and 12-inch records. Not to mention a working jukebox. In short, if you're a fan of 50s and 60s pop culture, this is *the* pizza place for you.  The second character you'll meet is Al (not Ray) the gregarious proprietor of Famous Ray's. He will quickly pop out of the kitchen to greet you and then just as quickly invite you into the kitchen so you can see your pizza just as it comes out of the oven.   From here, it's very apparent the differences that set Famous Ray's and Al apart from your average pizza place. He'll show you how he makes the dough, the herbs and spices that go into it, rather than the veggies left in their boxes in some storage room, they're colourfully piled behind the glass fridge doors so you can see what you're about to eat, even the chicken is roasted in house. On my most recent visit, he let me observe while he \"finished\" the crust of the pizza with a homemade herbal butter. The attention to the smallest detail is fun to watch and delicious to taste.   As well, any order over $20 gets a free Caesar salad, full of crisp romaine, garlicky dressing and crunchy homemade croutons. I haven't tried Famous Ray's \"Best Greek Salad in the World\" yet, but with a description like that I probably have to.  Famous Ray's makes a solid, Greek-style pie. My brother and I usually make it through 2 slices each before being defeated. So it's a good thing it makes for a fantastic lunch the next day.  For those seeking just a taste, he also offers a slice of pizza and a pop for $4.75.   This has quickly become my favourite pizza place due to the quality of the food, the decor and the genuine nature of the owner. Much like the souvenirs on the walls, they just don't make'em like this anymore."}
{"text":"It's hard to find New York style pizza in AZ. Usually when establishments claim New York style, the slice is no bigger than a slice from papa johns! Not at rays! My fiancé and I are from New York and we were pleased to find this gem. The guys are pretty much straight from BK and are rather entertaining. Great spot! And food is affordable! And apparently you can enjoy a glass of wine for 3.50. Doesn't get much sweeter than that!"}
{"text":"If I didn't keep forgetting I have a Ray's so close, I'd eat here every week. The upkeep of the store, the size, and the food just screams New York and I can't get enough of it. Though I do think the people walking the street in New York are nicer, if you can believe it. The chef making our pizza was nicer than the woman with the frown frozen to her face and only spoke to tell us the price of our large pepperoni with wings. I was legit afraid to ask for a refill on my coke, but she glared at me and begrudgingly gave me one when I finally got the courage to do so. I think maybe it's time they get some fresh faces behind that counter, that's all I'm saying."}
{"text":"Stopped bye to have some Pizza at 9:40. They were winning about needing to be out by closing time @ 10:30. Never heard of such a thing. Guess they don't need business. We had a group of 12 people. Guess they are already rich and do not need any business. Very rude. Made us feel very uncomfortable and unwanted. Will not be back. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Better than NYC.  Pizza was fantastic.  Please come to Little Rock"}
{"text":"Moved to Phoenix in July and as a native New Yorker, one of my greatest worries was that I wouldn't be able to find decent pizza anywhere. It may or may not have kept me up a night or two... ;) First day in Phoenix: I'm starving, the movers haven't arrived, and I don't have anything to consume in my new place.  I drive down the street and see Famous Ray's.  I say, \"hell, you're gonna have to start somewhere.\" I go inside.  Typical NY style pizza joint.  Order at the counter, pay, get your drink, have a seat...they'll call you when it's ready. The folks working the counter are definitely from NY (in case you couldn't tell by their ridiculously strong accents and all of the NY sport posters strewn across the wall).  Getting a good vibe so far. My name is called and I eagerly retrieve my pizza.  It looks just like what I'd get in NY.  More good vibes!  I taste it and I'm in heaven.  Seriously, it's so good that I have never been to another pizza place since I moved to Phoenix because I honestly don't have to (or want to!).   They have an everyday special of 2 slices and a fountain drink for $5.00 (can't beat that with a stick). They don't do delivery (boo), but I don't care.  I'd drive 50 miles for this pizza. Seriously, I think the stars aligned on my first day in the Valley of the Sun.  How else could you possibly explain how I found my pizza soul mate on my very first day here???   Moral of the story is: if you want legit NY style pizza, Famous Rays is your place."}
{"text":"Love your pizza, the hot wing were REALLY hot...yummy! Great food yelp wants me to add more to make the review so here it is but again great food"}
{"text":"I used to live just up the street from here. How could I have never tried this delicious pizza??!!! I'm dismayed at all of the mediocre pizzas I've had while missing out on this amazingness.   Aftet having a very expensive Scottsdale pizza, I was craving another New York style creation and Yelp'd New York pizza. And got a coupon to boot!  We picked it up and it was delectable. Had the last piece reheated for breakfast the next day and it was no less than excellent.   The canned mushrooms crack me up, but, as my husband says, they don't have fresh mushrooms in New York City!"}
{"text":"Meh...it was good, but not my style of pizza. I love a really thin crust and this is true NY style pie. If you like that kind of crust then I'm sure you'll love it. My husband thought it was amazing. They are very generous with the toppings."}
{"text":"Good Pizza nice menu. Tried this place after seeing a yelp deal. Had a free slice waiting for my pie."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza: the crust especially!! Hot wings were freaking amazing, everything I was looking for in taste and spice!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for REAL NY pizza, then look NO FURTHER than Ray's!!!  My first time there I was taken by my Mom, who obviously has GREAT TASTE, and told it is the \"BEST PIZZA IN TOWN!\" And no truer words have been spoken about a pizza joint!  The pies have HUGE slices!  The employees are TRUE BLUE New Yorkers! And BEST OF ALL...... GREAT TASTING PIZZA!!!  You've got to try it to believe it...... I guarantee you won't feel the same way about pizza!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this pizza place. They have a couple of locations throughout the valley but the location is my favorite. The staff is very nice and helpful.  This location has indoor and outdoor seating areas.  Great for kids since its s casual atmosphere.  The pizza is amazing and the best. The don't have boneless wings so that kinda sucks but the regular wings are good. The pizza can be a bit greasy for me so I just blot it with napkins. Most people wouldn't mind but for those out there that are like me just a heads up."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I never regret it! They have a coupon $15 for $25 just purchase it on Yelp then go in and pay the difference. The best part, is the cold beer one can enjoy while waiting for your food. They are rude (to each other) fast and don't have time for small talk feels just like I'm back in New York and I love it!"}
{"text":"ChaPman  Hyundai, here on bell road, had the pleasure of enjoying rays pizza for Saturday lunch. This was an absolute treat, the best wings in the whole city, and by far the best pizza we've ever had at this dealership. Thank you very much rays, we're hooked"}
{"text":"Take it from me, I'm from Brooklyn and Ray's Pizza is the closest thing you'll find to New York pizza in Phoenix!   The owners even import some of the ingredients from New Jersey! How cool is THAT!?"}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing, every time. I've been coming here for years and I've never been disappointed. The most recent visit I got \"The Monster\" (peppers, mushrooms, onions, sausage, and pepperoni). The crust is crunchy and chewy, and never soggy. an absolute must next time you want pizza!"}
{"text":"Not too bad. The pizza was big and really filling. NY style."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way home from Phoenix again.  I ordered a large  sausage and meatball pizza togo. After the ride back up the mountain I preheat my oven to 450 and heat slices on a pizza stone. I have to do this since we don't have decent pizza in Preskitt. Please don't suggest Bill's:(  We love Ray's. The pizza is ALWAYS consistent and delicious. This HV location is my go-to. We we there on fight night and they were gearing up for at least 100 pizzas!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time trying this establishment and it was delicious! The pizza is great and there are ample booths for comfortable seating (a must for my husband with back issues). We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"This is a horrible place for pizza. They have kids work there that to rip you off. Beware!!"}
{"text":"Best NY pizza around. I am always greeted by the guys making the pizza, but maybe because I smile at them first? The ladies are nice enough too. I think customers expect a red carpet or something. It's pizza and it is GOOD pizza. My favorite. I don't care if a monkey serves it to me I will continue to go back and stuff my face."}
{"text":"The best NY style pizza I have had in the state! I work near here so I have a go to option for a meal after work for the family or a quick option on the weekend. Decent service but I don't thing good pizza and good service go hand and hand anyway...at least not in my experience.My son loves it as does my husband."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, awesome people!  One of the best pizza's I've ever had, and tasty Italian beer to boot!  The guys'that were working their were really nice too.  I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Ordered pepperoni pizza & was disappointed. Just kind of blah. No zing in sauce or flavor in pepperoni. Hoping for a good pizza but did not receive. Will keep searching"}
{"text":"I was really turned off to a Rays at a different location a year ago because they used canned mushrooms, so I was hesitant to go here when my bf suggested to go to Rays again when I told him I was craving a large slice of greasy cheese pizza.. Luckily, this location is the closest to him.   We walked in and it had a super NY feel to it. The guy who took our order was super grumpy and so was the pizza chef, but they were so entertaining and as weird as it sounds, it made the place even more authentic. While most people would complain about the rudeness and all, I happened to appreciate and so did my bf.   We got the \"small\" order of garlic knots and the 2 slice and drink combos. What a great deal! The garlic knots took a while but it was definitely worth the wait. They were the best we have tried. And the marinara sauce was delicious too. The order was HUGE!! I couldn't believe that was considered a small. It can be shared by 2 or 3 people. The pizza was AMAZING! They were slices of heaven! It was exactly what I had been craving.   Can't wait to go back. New York City pizza in Phoenix :)"}
{"text":"I ordered two slices of sausage pizza from this Ray's and they were $3.00 each. It's not gonna break the bank but these slices are way too small for $3.00!  The crust was really good, there was almost no cheese and the sausage was ok.   Three stars was generous. I wouldn't recommend their slices. Maybe the whole pies are better?"}
{"text":"Pepperoni pizza. Very greasy. Good crust, maybe just cheap cheese? I needed to soak up the grease with a napkin. I wouldn't Go back."}
{"text":"I wanted to hate this place - I never trust those \"NY style pizza\" places in Arizona but I gotta say it was GOOD!! Place is clean, lots of booths. Service kinda sucked though. Not sure if he was trying to bring \"NY attitude\" as a gimmick or what but the dude that took my order acted like he could care less that I was there. I almost had to tell the guy to relax, I'm from NYC too. Luckily it didn't come to that. All in all though, the pizza is legit. Best I've had in AZ so far."}
{"text":"Good pizza and wings at a good price. Can't really go wrong with Famous Rays"}
{"text":"Good pizza, good salad, a bit pricey but they have good specials. Quick service and clean areas. Pretty solid place and in my opinion better than Mellow Mushroom across the street!"}
{"text":"I LOVE their pizza! It is lightyears away from the chains and the family owned atmosphere is awesome. Also the slices are HUGE!"}
{"text":"Rays has great pizza.  We got it to go.  Other reviews stated oily pizza, we didn't find it.  Just good pizza at a fair price.  I would bet the they make fresh dough daily!"}
{"text":"Just ordered my pizza and I have a good feeling about it. I work in the area and craved a slice of pizza so I took to the world of Yelp for recommendations. They have good reviews on Yelp and they were just a couple miles up the road, so I gave it a shot. The lady at the counter has a New York or Jersey accent (I can't tell them apart, sorry). I told her it was my first time and she helped me make a decision (bc I'm indecisive) and I made my own creation. She saw that I had a Yelp coupon for checking in. She happily took it and I just paid the difference bc I the coupon was for a free slice of cheese pizza with a drink. She didn't have to accept my coupon but she did any way. While writing this my pizza came out and my order was called. I went up there and boy does it look good. I'm looking at it as I type. I'm taking my first bite!... I just ate half of it before continuing my review. It is delicious! I'm so lucky I found a pizza joint close to work and home. The prices are low especially for the quality. Definitely coming here again! Sorry, pizza trumps Yelp today and I'm hangry!"}
{"text":"Solidly good pizza. Popped in for a couple of slices. Slice special is 6 bucks. 2 single item slices and a drink. Took a few minute well worth the wait. Hot hot slices crispy crust. Good flavor.. i wish it was closer."}
{"text":"Ambience: Old school, nothing fancy but not dirty either. New York memorabilia covers the walls in this small, 64 person occupancy dining room. A tv in the corner invariably shows ESPN.  Service: Very New York. Even the accents. These guys are short, to the point, yet very helpful. They lack that west coast bubbliness that is typical of AZ servers, but they are no less attentive.  Food: One of my top 3 pizza places in the valley, I can't talk it up enough. Crust is thin and perfectly chewy, toppings are good quality and very flavorful. Wings are crispy on the outside, and they have excellent buffalo sauce.  Price: A bit steep for pizza, they have a deal for a large pizza and a dozen wings for 24.95 that is pretty reasonable. Be prepared to pay about $30.00 for two.  I've been to this location at least 5 times and I plan to visit even more in the future. Don't confuse this Rays with others, it is truly unique."}
{"text":"Ronnie cooks/bakes the best pizza in town hands down! The service is amazing and the atmosphere is clean fun and family friendly"}
{"text":"Owner was nice. Pizza was good but not great. Fortunately had a yelp coupon which make it a great deal.  Good experience but not a do over."}
{"text":"Being from the east coast I'm a bit snobby about pizza.  But, this place is a solid spot for a good deal.  In a town where pizza isn't even close to par Ray's holds it's own.  The girls that work there are cute and they have some good lunch deals.  I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Ordered pick up from here and the wings were amazing!! They didn't have a whole lot of sauce on them which made me skeptical at first but once I ate them they were so delicious. We also got a pizza which was great as well. It was ready in 15 minutes. I would definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Pizza is really quite delicious, they've achieved a great crust, both crispy and chewy, not too much sauce, just the right amount of cheese...but it is also very greasy so if you're sensitive to that, (which I am not!), then be forewarned.   The reason for the three stars is due to the service, I really hope the guys behind the counter were just having a bad day because not once did they smile at anybody or even say thank you. Everyone there just seemed used to it and maybe that's how people from New York are? I prefer friendliness, and a little goes a long way, especially if I chose your place of business over the hundred other pizza places dotting Phoenix and you'd like me to come back.   I probably will, because as I said the pizza is delicious but probably not to dine in."}
{"text":"It was an old place but seemed clean. The garlic bread had way too much garlic and the wings were just ok."}
{"text":"Great deal for the money with the Yelp! deal for $10.  Pizza was good... NY style is not my favorite but I can recognize when something is good!"}
{"text":"after finding this place several months ago,   we drive out of our way to enjoy a slice of rays pizza,   I all most feel like I am in new York,   the Guy behind the counter has a great New York additude.  We got here just before there 130 mini rush, and experience NEW YORK.   LOL.  LOVE IT."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good. Haven't gotten around to trying their calzones yet, but their pizza has a good thin but chewy crust. Wings aren't going to blow your skirt up (I was wearing a skirt when I tried them, so I would know) but they won't blow your skirt down either (this, again, is based on my own research).  The other thing that I love, having spent some time on the east coast, is just how Jersey these guys are. They're surly as hell, yet somehow endearing. Embrace it."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and wings. The pizza is New York style but not greasy or floppy. This is our families new go to place for pizza and wings."}
{"text":"We love Famous Ray's. We have had the pizza and wings here and have never been disappointed. Plus I have a weakness for that NY accent. Nice guys!"}
{"text":"best pizza place in phoenix.  we love to dine in.  it has the old school pizza place vibe. a very generous glass of wine is also a plus"}
{"text":"I might actually give this place 3 stars if I could.  I had dinner here over the weekend with a bunch of friends, and all that I can say is that I am sorry I have not come here sooner.  I will definitely be back to this place, again and again.  I don't understand the ranking on Yelp, because this place is actually more reasonably priced that that.  For the prices, what you get here is absolutely amazing.  I highly recommend you try the Mozeralla Caprese.  It's one of the best I've had in Happy Valley, and possibly ranks among the best Capreses I've had since my last trip to Italy. Next, I had the Pollo Affumicato.  Omg, sooooo delicious.  And priced under $20!  Are you kidding me?  This place is a gem.  The vibe at this place is superb.  Very lively.  And you feel as though you're in Italy because of the decor.  I was especially fond of the extra authenticity added to this place by the numerous Soccer tournament posters all over, many of which say to be sponsored by Mr. Bunga Bunga himself, Silvio Burlosconi.  You may not like the guy, but hey, it sure as hell makes the restaurant authentic :-)  Finally, I'd like to say that the service here is \"Johnny on The Spot\".  Whatever you need, there's always someone around to take care of it.  Oh yeah, try the Grappa Amarone.  Good stuff, if you can handle it, that is.  Ray's is alright."}
{"text":"I've been going to this pizza place for fifteen years. I use to live in the neighborhood and would visit weekly. I now visit every few months. Best sauce ever!"}
{"text":"Just ordered some pizza and wings today and the pizza was good but the wings where very dry and did not have enough sauce. The person who took my order was very monotone and could have been more cheerful. If you order wings I would say to order the hot wings or order extra sauce on the wings."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and wings. Fed 4 hungry boys and all were happy. Owner from Brooklyn was fun to talk to and very accommodating."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Phoenix Ray's for 10 years since I moved to town from NY.  Great pizza and hot wings - reminds me of home!  Definately the most authentic in the valley.  There are too many other places that call themselves NY style, but just don't taste like it.  All the staff is from back East too."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I'm from New Jersey and it's hard finding an authentic place around here. Great food and people"}
{"text":"I normally don't post reviews, but I had to.The wings tasted like they were cooked in burnt grease. The deep dish pizza is not what I'm used to. It was a square pizza, but not deep dish."}
{"text":"I was craving pizza one night and wasn't really wanting the regular chain food pizza so I decided to swing into Famous Ray's Pizza. I am glad I decided to try a different place as this is my go to place when I want pizza. This is more of the New York style pizza which is sometimes hard to find. I've been there 4 times now and haven't had any kind of problem yet. The people that work there are quite friendly."}
{"text":"Really good NY style pizza! I got a cheese pizza and the crust was amazing! My kids really liked it. There are several other Italian dishes that I can't wait to try. The staff was friendly too."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza. They had a great selection. Services wasn't bad. The wings are also tasty. It was the breakfast of champions!   ; ^ D"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their pizza and drive out of my way to get it, closest thing I have found to real New York style pizza. I would highly recommend the sausage."}
{"text":"I was skeptical when my cousin asked me to go to pizza....at 7th St and Bell (we live in Central Phx).  I thought she was a little nuts to drive so far for pizza.  But YUM!  The place ain't fancy.  And the wine is from a really big jug.  However, the pizza was fantastic!  Excellent crispy crust but not at all burnt.  Lots of toppings!  I took some home despite my cousin's protest that the crust wouldn't be as good.  But a few moments in the toaster oven and I had a great leftover.    I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been feeding my stromboli addiction at Famous Ray's this past couple of weeks.  If you haven't yet had stromboli; it is akin to an giant Italian turnover, (see the photo I posted), filled with the ingredients of your choice.  I'm a meat aficionado so I order mine with sausage, meatball, Philly cheesesteak, mozzarella cheese, jalapenos and garlic; covered in more garlic and a variety of Italian seasonings.  Awesome!  I always have enough left over for a couple of breakfasts, or a breakfast and a TV nosh.  If you've had stromboli on Mulberry Street in Manhattan; or in Bensonhurst in Brooklyn; you won't be disappointed by the same at Famous Ray's on East Bell Road.  If you've never had stromboli; it is a great alternative to traditional pizza.  There is some humor here also; each time they bring it to the table, someone always wants to know \"what is that\"?  After all, it does look like a giant phallus."}
{"text":"Large pizza was too big for the box. Toppings we're ok, crust was like leather, and wasn't cut through.  Worst part: hot wings smelled like burning ass. They weren't burnt, but obviously the grease they cook them in was.  Also, too expensive when you add toppings. Not going back."}
{"text":"For the record I been here maybe a total of 5 times and the pizza isn't very good but it's cheap for a slice. Due to it being so cheap I have Ended up getting sick of there pizza 3 out of 5 times I have no idea if it because it's under cooked or if it was bad ingredients. I just end up getting a vibe I shouldn't be there, so I'm never going again. so people be aware the pizza I has was always a different texture."}
{"text":"As close as you can get to New York pizza in Arizona, absolutely delicious!  We had a terrible lunch a few doors down so came in to get a pizza to go.  I cant wait to try their calzones! The people that make the pizza and the cashier are extremely friendly.  greasy thin crust all day!"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago so I'm picky with my pizza--this place does it right (NY style)! I love the \"hole in the wall\" feel. Every customer that walked in was a regular which was a good sign. I ordered the Mozzarella sticks and a large Monster Pie (Sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, onion and cheese). The mozzarella sticks took a little while to come out but they were cooked to perfection. They also threw in a few garlic knots which was awesome. The pizza was unbelievable--I think the crumbled sausage really did it! They have great deals like large pie & 20 wings for $20 which I definitely will be taking advantage of during football games on Sunday. Glad to have found a new place where I can also be a regular!"}
{"text":"This place does serve some pretty good pizza. The atmosphere though doesn't look all that great. I do like though is that they do have pictures around the place that do scream out America. Any kind of pizza that you order would be good."}
{"text":"Really good! Think we may have had a miscommunication over the phone, as I ordered my pizza the wrong way. Wanted it super thin neapolitan style, and the kind I received was a little thicker than I had hoped for. But they cooked it a perfect well done (order it this way for a more authentic NY pizza experience). All in all, my fault, but I would definitely go back! Wish the sauce was a little more garlicky (garlic slut over here haha!) but throw a little garlic salt on there with some crushed red pepper and you are good to go! Thanks Ray's for a great pizza!"}
{"text":"Suoer good pizza and subs for the money.  I have been eating here for years...always good, hot and quick good.  If your in North Phx gotta stop in for a slice..pepperoni my favorite!"}
{"text":"The store near Bell and 7th St. was filthy. The employee making the pizza obviously had a cold or sniffles or something.  Repeatedly touched his face and handled the food.  My slice of pizza was very good. But the utensils were all soiled, the tables were dirty, windows dirty, etc.  Been to this and other Ray's pizza locations many times."}
{"text":"Wow ran in for the lunch special got two slices and drink it's a lunch special for like $6. I wanted bacon the don't provide that so I settled for ham. I watch the lady drop some ham on a already cooked cheese pizza and slide it back in the oven now I'm eating hard over cooked crust with uncooked ham, it's gross!! well I'll never come here again and there is my two cents...."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok , personally I thought it would blow my mind but it tasted a little better than frozen pizza. And the hot Wings were disgusting , they were literally stone cold and some were hot. It like they were frozen for a month and left in the hot sauce , really dry wings. Never coming back... Btw the guy who answers the phone is not very friendly at all when asking for specials and sounded very annoyed when I called."}
{"text":"I've been a customer of this location since 98. The food is amazing! The whole menu is really 2nd to none and you can always count on some sort of special.  It really feels like I'm back in NY when I step in this place. The service has always been a genuine kind of friendly and they're always quick, even during the Fri and Sat night rushes."}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time in months and it was exactly what I expected.  I have been going to this location for almost 10 years now, not very regularly.  Each time I go there I hope they are still in business because it seems most places in that plaza have struggled with the economy.  Sure enough, they're still in business.  I was pleased to know they still had their ALL-DAY 2 slices & drink special for around $4.50.   2 Cheese New York Style slices and a Mountain Dew.  Great pizza, laid back atmosphere you should expect from an authentic NewYork Style pizza joint.  Just as good as it has always been - great pizza. I have also had their wings in the past and they're great too!"}
{"text":"I work near Ray's and it is my go-to spot for good, quick and cheap eats.  I usually go for the daily lunch slice special.  Around lunch hours they have several slice options (cheese, pepperoni and sausage) par-cooked and waiting, with some other variations and varieties thrown in.  The white pizza if very good and the pesto is the best I've had in the valley.  Just pick your slice/s and they'll throw them in the oven for a minute or two to finish them. They often have slices of Sicilian pizza too. If it's available be sure to snag some, the crust is excellent.   I've only ventured away from the pizza once, to get a cheese steak and it too was solid; shaved rib-eye and good, salty Provolone.  I've never had any issues with the service, it has always been prompt and friendly.  As far as pie goes, you can't go wrong with Ray's."}
{"text":"Good slices here, including Sicilian.  Good deals too, the usual stuff - couple slices with soda.  Nice residual flour on the crust.  Sicilian sauce was tasty."}
{"text":"Very milky mozzarella here - excellent cheese on their pizza.  Thin NYC style slices make this a great lunch place.  Reasonable prices and usually has sufficient seating for the lunch crowd.     Faces the east, sharing same parking lot with Lowe's."}
{"text":"Pizzas good, but the service is horrible, I've ordered multiple times where they tell me over the phone a special for two pizzas for 25$ and when I arrive the person in the front tells me the lady on the phone \"likes to make up prices\", and \"doesn't know what she's doing\". Then continues to charge me the normal price for 2 medium pizzas, I'm not bothered by the price just the false advertisement. Also id check the boxes when you leave if you order any ranch along with it, I paid for a couple of ranches verified that I had them In the box , got home and nothing. Since then I've been going to spinados pizza on 16th st and bell, BETTER customer service, and great pizza no gimmicks."}
{"text":"These people are assholes. So dismissive and act put out when you want to patronize their business. Went in at 905 pm (sign says closed at 930) he couldn't get us out fast enough so they could close promptly at 9:12 pm. How they are still in business with this \"get out ASAP\" attitude. Fuck this place."}
{"text":"This is  hands down the best ol pizzeria in az  amazing!!!! Nothing beats this pizza and their specials. Give em a try you will be guaranteed you will be back for more!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried again, because like I said pizza is great but I just will not spend another dollar here ever again. It's not a New York attitude like other posts say. Go to Coney Island Grill downtown, New Yorkers who treat you great and have great food. Step up your customer service game."}
{"text":"Moved here from the east coast a few months ago and I've been hard pressed finding an even half decent pizza joint, until I found Rays. Their pizza is amazing and I will definitely be coming back.  Blows all the other pizza places I've tried out of the water."}
{"text":"I ordered a pepperoni pizza.  It was very good.  The small pizza was enough for 2 or 3 people.  Good flavor; not too greasy.  Good taste."}
