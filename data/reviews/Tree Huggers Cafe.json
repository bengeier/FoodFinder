{"text":"Yum yum yum! I had chicken salad wrap and corn chowder! It was delicious. The table also spilt a three bean appetizer which was also amazing. Friendly service. But at lunch time, but not a bad wait.  Prices are a but high... But worth it! I'm not vegan or vegetarian... But food was worth it."}
{"text":"Wonderful food for the healthy food set, but plenty of good grub if you are looking for a burger and fries..  Vegan and vegetarian fare abound. Fresh homemade salads and soups.  Just love this place!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat if you eat a plant based diet but have others along that eat meat. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the ingredients in the items on the menu. The food was very good. Thanks for being conscious about what goes into your customers bodies."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding.  Fresh and tasteful. Highly recommend. They have a huge variety of food and coffee as well. Don't miss an opportunity to try Treehuggers soon."}
{"text":"Excellent service. The food was indescribably wonderful. This is my new favorite restaurant! Earthy and simple, a delightful feel to it. They have great vegan and vegetarian dishes, but their menu also includes some chicken dishes for a win-win date night! They have a delicious selection of coffees, teas, and smoothies, as well as a scrumptious bakery! Definitely a place you wanna check out. :)"}
{"text":"Yum! Made from scratch goodness. Service aims to please. This is an intimate dining experience. I love their attention to detail! And, they have a drive-up window along with call-ahead ordering. Their bakery options -- including vegan and GF -- just yummy."}
{"text":"The only thing wrong with this place is the location.
It was difficult to find. It sits way back off the street so if you don't know about it you might miss this gem.
The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. 
And the menu is loaded with fresh, local vegetarian and meat options.
And then there is the bakery. OMG!
I've had so many wonderful things there that you won't find anywhere else.
So I guess I would order fried green tomatoes, and then spend half an hour trying to decide what to get. It's all too good!
It's healthy comfort food and ambiance. Love it!"}
{"text":"Was here with my granddaughter 2 days ago. Just love their gluten free bread. My granddaughter was able to get noodles with pesto sauce...something they concocted for her (not on menu). House burger yummy!"}
{"text":"Had to drive a while to get here, but it was well worth it. Fresh and scrumptious food. I had the bean dip and chicken salad wrap, loved both!"}
{"text":"A quality restaurant with fresh food at reasonable prices.  Very attentive wait staff, speedy food delivery,  and a nice selection.

And excellent cookies."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with this place! Great food, good coffee and wonderful service. 

The veggie delight is my favorite and the gluten-free bread is delicious. So many great options-- the Carb Free Plate, the sweet potato fries and the quinoa dip are definitely must-haves!"}
{"text":"How this place received 4 stars by anyone is beyond me. Only thing decent was fresh cut fries.
I ordered the beastie burger, which was cooked to order but did not have a gorgonzola wedge as stated in the menu.
My lovely wife ordered the black bean chimichanga. This was flat out disgusting and she could not eat it. First if you are going to use curry as your main ingredient say so in your menu. There was so much curry, it was overpowering and she could not eat it. I am not that discerning, so I said save the other half and I will have it for lunch tomorrow. Come tomorrow, I'm seriously eating ramen noodles because I could not stomach the amount of curry in this rice. Plain horrible. Save yourself the time and money (pretty steep nearly 25 bucks) and go somewhere where you can get what is offered on the menu without overpowering spices."}
{"text":"The menu was intriguing. Appropriate for the name. However,  food was extremely poor. Service was okay.  Burgers were burned. Fries were burned. The place was smoky from kitchen.  Portions were extremely small for price. Coffee was weak and tea distasteful. Waiter made excuses and didn't know menu and took almost an hour for food (Did provide 20 percent discount and removed burnt food. However left hungry.). We will not come back. Expected the rainforest and got a Forrest fire."}
{"text":"Treehugger's Cafe is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in the Cleveland area right now.  The Cafe is small but cozy and comfortable especially if you can get the one booth or the table in front of the fireplace.  The staff is always extremely helpful and friendly.  

The food is so good!  It's always amazingly fresh and prepared with care.  My favorites are the black bean burger, the black bean chimichanga, the oat burger, the bean salad (notice a theme here??), and, of course, the sweet potato fries!  I haven't had a single item from this restaurant that I have not enjoyed.  I had a pasta salad one time that I wouldn't list as a favorite but even that was good.

One of my favorite things about Treehugger's is that there are so many options for vegetarian and vegan diners.  I can order something and simply say \"please prepare that vegan\" and they immediately understand what I need/want.  I don't have to try to explain what vegan means or go through a list of what I don't want to be in my food.  I so appreciate that after dining in other restaurants!!  Many items can also be prepared gluten free if you have that restriction in your diet.

Don't fret omnivores!  If you want meat/fish/eggs, you can get it!  There are chicken items that are always on the menu and several times I have been in to find salmon or tuna in the specials.  My omni family and friends tell me these dishes are very good!

The prices are good when you consider the freshness and the quality of the foods.  Treehugger's supports local businesses and uses organic foods whenever possible.  If you want a chemical-laden frozen burger patty and fries for $5.95 go to Denny's and leave room for me at this little gem!

Oh, and get a vegan everything cookie to take home....yum!!!"}
{"text":"My brother was in town for a family visit...I took the family to TreeHuggers in Berea...( first time)...seating arrangements I wasn't happy ..I had someone sitting behind me with their feet right behind my head( thank god they kept their shoes on)...some tables where regular height and some were the high bar tables with the high bar chairs...the food was pricey..stingy on their toppings...the menu's were kinda dirty ..
The sweet potato fries are really good...and their fresh brewed tea is great ...their bakery not so good for the price...kinda high for doughy pastries that had no taste.."}
{"text":"I loved this cute little cafe. All of the food was absolutely delicious. The decor could use some work and it was fairly pricey for such a casual place, but overall we had a great experience."}
{"text":"Excellent Food!!  Very fresh and of the highest quality ingredients!  Wait staff is incredible every time I go.  easily the best restaurant around.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"We will not return.  Odd location in a strip plaza next to a gym, that's okay.  5:00 and we are the only customers.  Our waitress was clumsy and awkward.  She didn't check on us after the meal was served, other than a minute or two after she dropped off our plates.  Our drinks should have been refilled seeing we were her only customers.

Our appetizer pizza (gluten free) took about 20 minutes and came out with onion instead of tomatoes.  It took less than five minutes for them to (what seemed to happen) rinse the toppings off and reapply new toppings, and then ran it under a broiler.  I would have hope for a remake for $12, or a comp for the error.  

The burger was adequate the bun didn't seem fresh.  The sweet potato fries were good but many of them were stuck together, maybe frozen?  

My wife ordered a breakfast sandwich (gluten free), not the greatest taste.  Her home fries were chopped up French fries, terrible!  

I mistakenly ordered what I thought was a gluten free cookie to split.  The waitress must have know that my wife only ordered and ate gluten free, yet didn't ask if we knew that the cookie was not GF.  Major error on her part as she is working in a restaurant that caters to people that suffer from gluten related issues

Our appetizer pizza, two drinks, two sandwiches and a cookie came to over $50.  With a tip we left $60 lighter and completely unsatisfied.  I read so many glowing reviews and had great expectations.  

The (what appeared to be) owners or managers never stopped by to welcome us or see how we liked our meal. 

We have eaten at the Mustard Seed Cafe in Akron and the Root Cafe in Lakewood.  They are by far-and-away much better vegan, gluten free and vegetarian restaurants Please save your money and spend less than half at one of the two I mentioned, (and have a far better meal and experience)."}
{"text":"loved this place - a little far from where we live but we do go far from our home to church so what's another 20 minute further drive.  Wish there was something like this on the eastside"}
{"text":"Food is excellent, but staffing seems to be a consistent issue.  Wait for an extradorinary time just to be seated, let alone place an order and get served.  This happens everytime im in, seems clear they need more than one server working.  The fact that i keep coming back tells you the food is quite good :)"}
{"text":"This is our family's favorite! Anytime we have 
Out of town guests, we take them here.  We 
Love the organic foods, the ambiance and the
Staff, especially on a summer evening when 
We can sit outside on the patio.  They have great
Cookies too."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place. But I don't, I can't.
First, there is a huge cleanliness issue. The floors were sticky. There were flies in the dining area. My son used the bathroom and came out horrified because it was swarming with flies. And the dining area was full of smoke from food that had been burned.
Second is value/cost/quality. Unfortunately, there are issues here too. We had 2 bowls of potato leek soup, one order of three bean dip, and one breakfast burrito, plus 2 bottled sodas. The soup was OK. The dip was OK, the pita squares with the dip were very good. The breakfast burrito was dripping grease. I don't know how to even make that happen. Our total was over $50 before tip. That is unreasonable. We're not in a trendy area, we're in Berea. We're not in a place where one would pay for ambience (see the parts about sticky floors, flies, and smoke). 
Third issue was kitchen speed. I understand that the food was \"custom made\" according to the menu, but it's unreasonable to wait 45 minutes for what we ordered.
So, although I absolutely want to support this place (because they always sponsor the Berea Animal Rescue Fund Monster Mutt Dash, because they have a large selection of vegetarian and vegan options) I can't. Too expensive, too slow, and too dirty. 
On a positive note, our server and every staff member was incredibly nice. Please make this a place I can want to go."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  We arrived on a weekend evening with a group of 12 (yes, twelve) and had planned to just grab some simple snacks.  I didn't realize that this place has a myriad of options, from fresh bakery goods to lunch meats and vegan side dishes to go to appetizers to full meals, including kids' meals.  I felt bad that we hadn't called ahead since we weren't planning to sit down and eat, but the staff was very accommodating despite our sudden arrival.

Our party ordered a variety of vegan snacks, appetizers, and entrees.  The vegan family with us commented that they often don't get a chance to eat out because finding good vegan food is truly hard to do...and everything they tasted was dynamite!  I myself had their morning glory muffin which was wonderful.  It was just moist and sweet enough that it wasn't overly sweet nor bland like a bran muffin.  Perfect for a healthy snack.

They also have a wonderful selection of vegan drinks, including a variety of iced teas and a wonderful chai tea latte.

All in all, it was a relaxing evening with great food from a wonderfully accommodating staff."}
{"text":"I usually have a great experience.... But the drive thru was blocked, so had to go in. Took me peaking around the wall,and asking for assistance despite 2different waiters passing me more than once. And breakfast burrito was bland....very disappointed."}
{"text":"Is it always amateur staff day? If so, you guys have a very long way to go. Very very rude staff except for our waitress. The food was anything but decent.. It was gross and sloppy.  And that's coming from a gluten free vegan life style. A suggestion would be to get employees that actually care about the business, the food and the customers. We need more places that care about the environment and are health conscious and it's too bad that tree huggers cafe is the only one around. If someone gives you guys competition, your toast.. With real chefs that know how to cook real food and also know how to treat their customers"}
{"text":"Excellent vegan and vegetarian place that also has choices for meat eaters. Cozy atmosphere and friendly staff make it a hidden gem in an otherwise abandoned strip mall."}
{"text":"While I love the concept and mission of this restaurant, hate the execution. The 3 times I've been here has ended in disappointment and hunger. 

Stopped in for a late lunch with my husband yesterday afternoon, ordered the following:

Roasted Corn Chowder -- bland, tasted like frozen kernals -- no \"roasted\" taste. It was in no way a chowder. If you called it a soup, I might accept the watery broth, but this tasted like a can of unsalted corn kernals and canned peppers in water. Horrible. It screamed for salt, fat, and taste. Not to mention, there was a chunk of nasty potato with a giant black spot. Roasted corn chowder implies fire roasted or grilled corn. 

Black Bean Burger -- decent, came out as advertised. Carrot salad side dish was overly sweet, soggy, not very flavorful. The bun was a stale old pretzel bun, seemed like they tried to steam it in an attempt to revive the 3-day old bun. It had the consistency of a soggy pretzel. 

White Rhino Old Oat Tree Burger -- awful, mushy, way under-salted, and completely not the flavor profile I had expected. Heavy on the turmeric so it had a flavor reminiscent of curry, but a very wimpy one, with a paste-like consistency in the middle, and another disappointing weird pretzel-like bun. I ordered the bean salad as a side -- which tasted sour, like it had been in the refrigerated case for too many days. Blech.

Service: awful. During the time I was there, I counted 6 people who appeared to be working there... there were only about 5 tables when we were sat -- and yet the service was very slow and awkward. We had placed our drink order. She leaves, comes back 5 minutes later and asks me what I wanted to drink. 

Here's how my food order went:
Server: \"Do you know what you want to order?\" (She's holding an order pad and pen, so I assumed she's writing everything down)
Me: \"Yes. I'd like a Tree Hugger's salad, the corn chowder, a White Rhino Old Oat Tree Burger.\"
Server: \"What kind of side?\"
Me: \"I'll take the beans\"
Husband: \"I'll have the black bean burger and the carrot salad\"
Server (to me): \"So you still want the soup, AND the salad? AND the oat burger?\"
Me: In my head...\"WHA?!\" I'd just told her 30 seconds ago?

It took a long time for the food to come out, which all came out at once.  Why not soup and/or salad first?! The oat burger is like a wet sock and the server is no where in sight. In fact no servers are in sight. There's some guy with a soul patch on the phone behind the register at the counter who's paying absolutely no attention to what's going on out on the floor busy tinkering behind the counter. Is he a proprietor? A manager? Or just some guy? My husband gets up to try to ask the soul patch guy at the counter for ketchup, but he totally ignores my husband and avoids by moving to a different area of the counter. By then, the server comes back and I ask for ketchup but doesn't ask how the food is. She says she's going to get us some extra napkins, but never really asks how the food is. I had really wanted dessert and coffee when I had come in, but after the painful torture of the horrible meal, I just couldn't stay any longer.

It would be obvious to any experienced/conscientious server from the amount of food left on the plates, that there's something wrong. She doesn't even ask if we want to go boxes, so it seems like denial, or avoidance -- like she's used to customers not liking the food, but not wanting to have the difficult conversation to fix the customer experience. I had put the rotten lettuce and the blighted piece of potato off to the side of the plate, but no one even noticed. She had taken our plates past the soul patch guy who doesn't even appear to be concerned with the clearly barely-touched sides and half-eaten plates going past him. He must be used to it too. I should have learned from the previous disappointing experiences I had there, instead of flushing another $42 down the toilet. 

It's such a shame because I want to like a place that strives to be ecologically responsible, offers wholesome foods, and sources locally, but their service and food are horrible. I would have given this place 0 stars, but the only reason why gave it 1 is because of their attempt at sustainability.  Also, they need to overhaul their menu -- the items lack detailed description so the food is so far off from expectations, that it makes the experience that much worse. While I understand the challenges of running out of items while trying to source locally -- the kitchen and servers need to communicate to the customers what's different on the menu, what's being substituted. They also need to not hold their prepared foods for so long. They taste stale, and often have absorbed other odors from the refrigerated case. Their menu is NOT cheap. $12-$14 for a burger is totally acceptable if it's well executed and the dining room is impeccable. I've given up on this place."}
{"text":"This place used to be much better years ago. Now, it's very spotty and not worth the risk that you will over pay for what you are getting.

I placed takeout order around 2pm on a weekday and was told 10-15 minutes. I picked it up in 20 minutes and still had to wait about 5 minutes. I ordered the protein wrap, in which I used to order all the time a few years back. They are getting cheap by filling up the wrap with iceburg lettuce and white rice, and hardly any beans/and other good stuff. I called and said \" the menu states  brown rice and I remembered there to be much more good stuff in the wrap and not just white rice and lettuce\" he said \" we use Jasmine rice\" and i said \" ok\" and he said \" sorry\",,,, that was it! I wasn't looking for anything other than a more sincere apology. This place has gone down hill. Also, if you want to sit outside to eat in the parking lot, they no longer have patio umbrellas, so if you want to bake outside in the sun while eating then you are in luck!"}
{"text":"What the heck happened to this place???  I am vegan and live in Los Angeles, but I've got family in Ohio, so this would be my go to place  before or after I got off the airplane since vegan food in Akron is pretty scarce.  
I was sorely disappointed this time.  It seems like they added way more meat and cheese to the menu and that the vegan items were more of an afterthought.  I mean, the scrambled tofu comes with an egg and cheese on top!  Why do that when there are numerous egg dishes on the menu?  When I ordered it I asked that they leave the egg off and use vegan cheese instead.  What I got was almost a joke-the 'scrambled' tofu was broken up pieces of tofu with no seasoning and it hadn't been sauteed or browned in any way.  There were some vegetables and some sliced vegan cheese that had been broken up into pieces laying on top, completely unmelted.  All this was supposed to be on top of home fries, but it was nothing more than broken up pieces of french fries instead.  Weird and unappetizing.  
Also, the staff seemed to be young and extremely ignorant about the menu items.  When I asked if their special veggie burger of the day had any wheat in it. they could not tell me.  When I ordered the gluten free toast I asked if I could have vegan butter (Earth Balance) instead of butter and the waiter looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language.
But the biggest disappointment was my dessert.  I would dream of the giant chocolate peanut butter brownie dessert between my visits.  It used to be the yummiest vegan and gluten free dessert ever, but the one I had this time was kind of heavy and dry.  The peanut butter filling that used to be creamy and dreamy was like a giant hunk of (barely) peanut flavored powdered sugar.  The chocolate portions barely tasted of chocolate-a sure sign of cheap flavorings.  I bought mine for a treat on the long plane ride back to California and ended up throwing it away.  
I guess this is a good option if you are not vegan and just want to eat a healthier lifestyle, but if you are vegan and are looking for an oasis of yummy food, I'd pass this one by.  So so  sad."}
{"text":"I went here several years ago when it first opened and was overall unimpressed. I returned today to give it another chance, and left with the same impression. 

The gluten free vegan \"morning glory\" muffin I had was awful. I recognize that it's difficult to make good vegan/GF baked goods, but if you're going to sell them and use them as part of your marketing image, they better be at least passable. The muffin was dry, hard, and not flavorful. 

I also got an iced latte. It was watery and bitter. It had no hint of the rich, complex flavors of espresso -- it tasted exactly like iced coffee with a lot of milk. I'm pretty sure that's what it was."}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY love TREE HUGGER's!! The food, the service, and the atmosphere. I really wish they would extend their restaurant. I tried the vegan cookies and power muffins for the first time. I will purchase both each time I return."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been in our \"usual places' since we moved to Strongsville. I appreciate the fact that the meat and diary are organic, etc. I also like this restaurant as my wife is vegan/plant based diet, so the both of us can be happy. Food is always fresh. Service is sometimes a little bit slow, but everyone is always very courteous. Sometimes, it seems a bit pricey depending on meal etc, but I have never had a reason to complain other than that.

The most negative thing is they are in BFE. I really would hope that they could move to downtown Berea. IMHO, the college students alone would bring in a lot more business, and add that to Cornerstone, Sweet Mango, etc. would make for a lively more eclectic Front street."}
{"text":"Always a great place to have a relaxing meal.   We are enjoying a beautiful sunny day out on the patio eating great food."}
{"text":"stopped in to check this out while i was waiting for car repair in berea.  at one point, someone that i once worked with told me that they have vegan bakery and i was curious to see what they had, since i bake as well.  i cringe at the name of the place and instantly think of dirty hippies, sorry but if it is food related, i would have gone in a much different direction here.  the menu looked great and the place was full on a sunday afternoon.  i walked up to the counter and placed an order for chai, tea and baked goods and sat down.  sad to find out that this place had no wi-fi to share, so i sat and transfered music files with the person i was with.  sadly, no one brought our order to the table and we just wrote it off, deciding that we would skip it after all.  we ended up killing time there until i got the call that my car was ready.  the girl who i spoke to at the counter walked by a dozen times and as we were leaving someone asked if he could bring us anything about an hour and a half after we walked in.  oops!  someone else can hug this place!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time with my boyfriend; it was wonderful food and great service at a good price. I would definitely recommend this place, and I will be going back again. :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, the wait was kind of annoying, but we did go at lunch time so that was to be expected. Overall I will return."}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend at the Tree Hugger's Café. There are a lot of menu choices. All are healthy, and all are pricey. I had the Plain Jane burger and sweet potato fries. It was very good, and the fries were great. But, I could have gotten the same meal elsewhere for about half the price? I am all for \"humane meat\" and good food choices, but I am also on a very fixed income and that was a very expensive lunch. If the owners want to fill the place, they need to add some affordable options."}
{"text":"This place is a neighborhood gem!  Nearly everything we have tried there is amazing.  The setting is a little dark, but has a coffee-shop like homey vibe.  I love that they include plenty of vegetarian options - I am not vegetarian but do love my veggies!

You can't go wrong with any of their panini sandwiches - they have a depth of flavor you don't typically find in a sandwich.  I also love their selection of coffee and tea, as well as the vegan desserts.  It is a little on the pricey side -but in my opinion it is worth it. 

My only complaint is that it seems that the food takes forever to come out.  I am guessing that is because they cook everything to order, but we are usually ravenous by the time the food comes out.  But again - it's worth it so we'll be back."}
{"text":"Wow! My husband went to pick up a meal for both of us after a beautiful day at Edgewater park. A order was placed with the most delightful server for carry-out. I choose the Quinoa burger meal, my husband choose the Tuna wrap meal. We were waiting in the car and the server brought it out, Oh my beyond excellent service!! The food was  AMAZING every taste bud in our mouths were buzzing with excitement! This meal was worth every penny and more! We are going back next week... So excited! This company also has great values regarding our food sources. Thank you for having something great and different for Ohioans who want healthier options."}
{"text":"The food is okay.  I like the healthy aspect of it- but a lot of it lacks in seasoning.  Treehuggers always has coupons- which works to bring customers in the door.  But, I think (possibly) that their high priced menu is to make up for the loss of the coupon.  When you use the coupon, the price of the meal is decent.  I would never go there without one."}
{"text":"Loved it. Amazing range of vegetarian and vegan choices. Warm people and a cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome food, healthy choices, and something for everybody.  What an unexpected restaurant in an unusual location in Berea.  My wife and I are vegan, so we really enjoy their many vegan options (apps, sides, entrees, and deserts), but they have just as many (or more) options for meat eaters as well.  They seem to be able to cater to any special requests, such as dietary restrictions or food allergies, and are very knowledgable about what is in their food.  My personal favorite is the Shanna's Favorite Panini, prepared vegan, and fresh cut fries.  I often order this for breakfast (you can order any menu item for breakfast).  They have a great looking salad bar, and an amazing selection of vegan cookies.  If you weren't looking for this place, it would be hard to stumble upon.  It is far back from the street in a relatively low traffic strip mall.  It is definitely worth seeking out.  Prices are a bit high compared to other restaurants in the area, but this is not your normal restaurant.  I will gladly pay a couple of dollars more to eat local, organic, produce served by a friendly and knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"What a breath of fresh air! In our business travels we were delighted to find this healthy, veggie-friendly place, a short drive from the lame area of North Olmsted in which we were staying. We liked it enough to return the next time we were in town. The first time we visited the restaurant was PACKED and the servers & cooks seemed overwhelmed, but we still had a good experience. I was disappointed, though, that my salad did not have the fresh blackberries on it that were listed in the menu. It might have been a deal-breaker if I'd been told that by my server. Portions weren't huge, considering the prices, but since almost everything is organic and local(ish), slightly higher prices are understandable.
On our second visit I had some creamy tomato basil soup that was one of the BEST soups I've ever had. Seriously impressive. I also had the sweet potato quinoa burger - unusual, and not quite as tasty as it sounded, but still pretty good. I'd asked for goat cheese, which was forgotten. The server was really nice about it, and took it back to add it. It came back promptly, but it had been microwaved, which I thought was really strange. Goat cheese doesn't need to \"melt\", and since there was a sauce and sprouts already on the burger, it got a little weird when thrown into a microwave. Bad choice on someone's part. 
Overall, though, a great choice in a place with not a lot of good choices. Tasty baked goods (I recommend the buckwheat muffin!), and fun salads to go, too."}
{"text":"I went to Tree Hugger's for the first time last night. I ordered the Sweet Potato Quinoa Burger and a Diet Coke. My burger was pretty good, but very overpriced at $13.00!! I was unaware when I ordered my Diet Coke, but they only have plastic bottles and they charge $3.00 for them! Wow! I find this place incredibly overpriced. Just because it serves healthier dishes should not mean that they mark up prices 50%! I will definitely not be back...unless I win the lottery sometime soon. $22.00 (including tip) for a burger and a coke? I think not."}
{"text":"Three cheers for Tree Hugger's!

I am a big fan of this relative new restaurant! I've been here multiple times (for both dine-in & takeout) & have not been disappointed yet! They have a great selection on their menu that includes meat entrees, vegetarian options, & even vegan/gluten free meals! You can make your meal to order, asking for vegan cheese or gluten free bread, & they always have new season specials for you to choose from!

They've also jumped on the bandwagon that is \"half a sandwich/panini & soup\" deal! This is an option I've taken many times if I can't decide between my favorite panini & a new great sounding soup. 

Have I mentioned the sweet potato fries?? Goodness me. Talking about them makes my mouth water. The perfect amount of sweet, salty, & crisp crunch paired with a delicious homemade honey mustard dressing is alone worth visiting this place for. Seriously. No, seriously.

The pastries, cookies, & cakes are DELICIOUS! Some are even gluten free & vegan! Everything is homemade & fresh!

All of their ingredients are organic & most are bought locally. They even have a long list of who they buy from! The service is always friendly & very attentive. The facility itself is very clean & adorably decorated. They offer comfortable booths or tables with a fireplace against the wall. 

They are also very supportive of local artists. I have come in a few times to see a musician performing their music or have a table set up selling their merchandise.

The prices are a little more than I would prefer to spend, but when I think of the type of food I'm getting & knowing where it came from & what is in it, it all adds up to be absolutely worth it!

Check it out for yourself! I promise you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was just O. K. However, it was only my item that just didn't appeal to me. My family did enjoy their sandwiches.  Pricing was listed as \"moderate\", but it was actually \"high\". I've been to several vegan friendly places, and pricing is usually in line, but this place was just outrageous. I had something called \"Shana's favorite-veggie sausage, rice cheese, caramelized onions, avocado\". I asked if they could make it vegan, and received a oat burger, slice of rice cheese, no onions, and a sliver of avocado on 2 slices of Jewish rye bread, lightly toasted, w/home fries. The cost? $9.00  As for the desserts? 1 large chocolate, $2.95, and 1 lemon scone $3.95.  Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"I've met a friend here for brunch. Food was good, and they had some specialty teas which I love. I had the dandelion iced green tea - loved it. it was a nice quiet place to sit & chat."}
{"text":"Great place to go, if you are Vegan, or are exploring new tastes. Their coffee is delicious. Their veggie burger, with sweet potato French fries, and side of mustard, is the best I've had."}
{"text":"Can i have the cucumber stack? We don't have that.

Can i have salmon in my salad? We don't have that, you must have an old menu.

I'm online, is that an old menu? You know what, nevermind."}
{"text":"My wife is vegan so it's hard to find quality food for her at restaurants.  That is why we love this place. It has a great selection, friendly service and reasonable prices. We come here every time we are in town. The sweet potato fries with honey mustard dipping sauce are a must order!"}
{"text":"Dynamite pumpkin soup! \"SHROOM BURGER was the shit\" quote from my boyfriend. Their artisan bread was very delicious. I got the zucchini panani with a side of the kale salad, what a great pairing. The kale was delightful and super refreshing. The sandwich was a great choice as well, the olive pesto was a nice pairing. Overall, I was very satisfied with the meal and so was my boyfriend. We can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu.
The service at Treehuggers was on point, everyone was super helpful and nice. Very knowledgable of the menu and super friendly with great recommendations. 

Overall, this place is now on my radar. I love how fresh and wholesome the food was. Not to mention I love the fact they use all local products and services!! More restaurants need to follow this.  I wish I would've gotten some of the bakery there, but I was too full, next time though I wiill get a peanut butter brownie! Check this place out, its small, but quiant and charming inside. LOVE IT!
CHECK IT OUT"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my bf and his friend.  We started the meal with edamame potsickers which were fantastic. I ordered the eggplant sandwich and it was ok. I enjoyed the sweet potato fries way more than the sandwich and side ( butternut salad). The bf and his friend enjoyed their burgers. I didn't get to sample the sweets but they looked yummy. 

As some people mentioned the prices are more expensive. Our meal ended up being $75 including tip.  The thing that bothers me is that if you are charging that much money..... Turn on the A/C! The day we went it was high 90's and the restaurant had no A/C. It was one of the most unpleasant experiences I have had dining bc we were uncomfortable and hot.  I left angry bc we spent so much money and although the food was delicious, I'll likely never come back because I hate sweating while dining."}
{"text":"RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED, small portions and hope you have ton of free time in the day if you come here because youre gonna be waiting forever for your food. The only reason im giving 2 stars and not one is because the food was ok. Nothing to write home about.  Thank goodness for the 20% off i got from yelp."}
{"text":"This out-of-the-way cafe is worth the extra effort and expense. Excellent food; friendly, attentive service. Many great choices for the plant-based diner. It's a new addition to a short list of my favorite places in this area."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy, I love tree huggers food in my tummy . 
As a vegan, dining out can be difficult. Tree huggers healthy choices makes it easy.

They also only use humane beef and chicken ."}
{"text":"Amazing that there can be a place like this that makes such good, healthy food you simply can't find outside of your kitchen!!! Kudos

Great food!!!"}
{"text":"The only compliant I would ever have about this restaurant is that it's super small and can get a bit crowded at times. Because they food is made with special care for freshness, it can sometimes take a while for you to get your food. The staff here is always super friendly and more than happy to explain anything on the menu. I LOVE their vegan and gluten free bakery treats! I usually get some to go after a meal there. Would 200% recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food at decent prices considering the amount you receive. However, bad slow service. Sweet potato fries are pretty good. I like the black bean burger and hell's kitchen. Not my first choice, but would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Great place for vegetarians.  They also have fish and chicken items (2-3 items).  Natural, local and organic.  Made from scratch. Variety and options..... They offer choices way beyond the usual boring salads and wraps and sandwiches.  These guys know that there is more to a salad than lettuce, tomatoes and dressing.  Need I say more about the food???
Ambience is nice.  Gives off a vibe of small and hip place. Seating and walking isles are bit congested, but its fine once u r seated.  Servers are friendly and were able to answer questions about the food.  Service was also good.  
Portions are sufficient.  Most of us are used to seeing giant portions and carrying doggy boxes after meals.    But this place has just the right amount of food for you.  And because its good quality mostly natural food, it does not leave you feeling heavy and sick at the end.
Prices could be a little lower....but they are offering what others are not at this point in this locality.
Definitely recommend that you go and check it out.  Usually u can find restaurant.com coupons for this place."}
{"text":"Yikes! Avoid this place at ALL COSTS. Very rude staff. Entitled hipsters that don't greet you. You have to go searching through the restaurant to find someone. Then you need to pry their attention away from their cell phone to actually help you. I had a Groupon that they gave me a hard time about using because they were too lazy/stupid to enter the code by hand. 

Speaking of stupid, one of these idiots asked me what temperature I wanted my veggie patty cooked too. After reminding her twice that it is a veggie burger not meat, she finally said, \"okay whatever\". So rude and apathetic. I can't believe this place is still open. The food is very mediocre at best. Their grilled cheese is supposed to come with \"Toucan\" Veggy Grilled Cheese................................................................................................................... $12 Fresh mozzarella, cheddar, tomato, avocado, caramelized onion, sprouts and red pepper pesto. Served on our homemade Tuscan herb bread. Side dish varies.\" Sounds good right? WRONG you will get scattered mozzarella, a slice of cheddar cheese, and one slice of tomato. No avocado, caramelized onion, sprouts, or red pepper pesto, Oh, it will also come with bread butts instead of full slices. Beyond disappointing. I'm pretty sure a small child could make a better sandwich than what I received. Their pasta salad is also disgusting. Their  bruschetta is supposed to come with pita bread, they just toasted sandwich bread and cut it into pieces. The burger had no flavor, and came with tomato despite asking for no tomato. Luckily it was a preference issue and not an allergy because I'm pretty sure these idiots would  not care if they caused a serious allergic reaction.

Do yourself a favor and go across the street to Burger King. They will provide you with better service and food guaranteed."}
{"text":"I had some of the best food I've ever had in a restaurant here. Our service was immediately great, as we were greeted and the specials were explained immediately. We went for the stuffed spaghetti squash that was on the special menu, the fried zucchini and the grilled lemon chicken panini. The spaghetti squash was cooked to perfection and the zucchini was gone before we could even blink our eyes. The panini was good, but less to my tastes. It seemed a bit dry, but that could have been because I was eating juicy squash as well. The bun was my favorite part of the sandwich--it was light and fluffy, but still heavy enough to hold the sandwich and stand alone as a flavor. 

Everything was delicious and we were stuffed by the end of the meal, but not in a bad way. It was all fresh, healthy and delicious! Of course, the sweets couldn't be avoided and we ended up with one of each cookie. The chocolate chip was good, but the key lime definitely won for best flavor and texture.  

I have my eye on everything else on the menu and plan on making the trek here a little more often now that I know the treasure that resides in Berea!"}
{"text":"Love how much Tree huggers cafe promotes eating healthy and organic! We need more places like this. It is absolutely fundamental for our health and future to eat more organic foods and cut out gmo's and conventionally grown vegetables covered with pesticides. With this being said I will definitely be returning here! The food was great!"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant mainly because they have a very very nice selection of vegetarian and vegan offerings. I also live closer to this restaurant than I used to, meaning I can now eat there more often. They're vegan desserts are very delicious and their french fries are to-die-for, probably the best french fries you can find in Cleveland. My only gripe is that it can be costly to eat here with my whole family, and while I do believe it is worth it, this does prevent us from eating there frequently. I have also had their catering and its very good. I got carnivores to eat vegetarian, even if for one meal. Highly recommended overall."}
{"text":"An excellent Vegan / Vegetarian friendly restaurant in Berea.  Looking for a change of pace from the \"normal\" places to eat out?...then give this place a try!

Never had a bad meal here and they always seem to have something interesting and new to try.  Veggie burgers, good wraps, excellent soups and some truly amazing side dishes (like the seaweed salad!).

Prices are a bit high (for what they serve), but the food quality seems top notch so I really don't mind.  Make sure to try their desserts, too...delicious!"}
{"text":"My first experience here was disappointing.  So I decided to give Treehugger's another shake.  Well, glad I did.  This time I went for the Roasted Beet salad and added on organic grilled chicken.  What a home run!  The presentation was beautiful, the beets were thinly sliced and roasted, the chicken was grilled perfectly, and the oranges, dried cranberries and feta nestled among the honey lemon vinaigrette were scrumptious.  Yes you will pay $12-$15 for a salad here but it is the quality of ingredients that makes it worth it."}
{"text":"We drove 55 miles for this. My wife is a big non-gmo, organic person. I prefer not being an experiment for Monsanto but hey, what are you going to do? Blue Door Cafe is our usual place to go on the weekends but we thought we would try something new.

Pulling in there is not much atmosphere. They do have a nice outdoor eating area. The inside is a little tight. Not much to say there. 

My wife ordered the black bean brown rice chimichanga. I got the Beastie BBQ Gorgonzola red pepper carmelized onion pretzel bun burger, a goat cheese beet salad and a side of fries that came with my burger. The beef was humanely raised, grass fed, etc. 

Chimichanga; perfectly fried, a little dry but the mango salsa brought it together.

Burger; the patty looked a little too perfect like it was a frozen patty but it tasted great! The fried cheese wedge atop the burger was floating in a sea of house made BBQ sauce that was fresh and flavorful. Very nice soft pretzel bun. I would order again. 

Fries; great fries. Really good. Soft, not crispy but that is my preference. The ketchup is clearly a bottled ketchup and not organic. Sheds a light of questionability on their level of commitment to organic foods. For me, on this meal experience that is what keeps me from going five stars because atmosphere is not that big of a deal to me. Loved the music they play here. Sara Bareilles, The Cure, Sarah McLachlan, etc.

Beet salad; these are roasted thinly sliced beets served warm over greens with candied walnuts, dried cranberries, mandarin oranges and goat cheese. This was the highlight of the meal. Delicious!

Vegan everything cookie; perfect for what it is. I don't think you can go wrong with a cookie here."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this wonderful cafe just driving by. The sign invited us to eat green and that is so hard to do in this area. It is as organic as they can be with no freezer. Our waitress was so informative and helpful and explained everything about the cafe. The menu is also coded for Vegans and Gluten Free meals. The salad I had was fabulous. It was the Scarlett Macaw made from fresh field greens, big fresh blackberries, orange sections, dried cranberries and nuts topped with a cranberry balsamic vinaigrette. I added an organic grilled chicken breast to top it off and it was very filling and tasty. 
The food is fresh and tastes so good. It was so nice that I stopped there on my way to BW for class on Tuesday night for dinner. The prices are very good for organic freshly made food. 
Nice deli and bakery case with lots to take out. The owners are hands on people and want to know what you think and what can they add to the menu. This is as far away  from fast food as you can get. Very nice atmosphere with the fireplace going. You can stop in just for coffee or tea and a delicious bakery muffin or cookie. I am very impressed with this cafe/restaurant.
If we want this type of food then we all need to support them which my husband and I will do. You can tell the owners care about good food and all that goes along with eating green and they care about what you think. I can't rave about the Treehugger enough!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a recommendation from CherBear.  A little pricey, but the food is good & fresh.  Try the black bean nacho dip, it is top notch."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in with a Groupon on a Saturday afternoon, and we were impressed.  I'm not a vegan or a vegetarian, but I do appreciate local, high-quality ingredients and creative, healthful cooking.

I had the ground chicken burger with mango salsa, and a side salad.  Both were full of flavor and tasted incredibly fresh.  The appetizer of sweet potato fries is big enough for four or five people and comes with a spicy brown mustard that works like a charm."}
{"text":"First time, just came from lunch there (Fri. - 12/28/12) and was pleasantly impressed.  However, as many others have alluded to is the pricing.  2 of us - we had the appetizer of fried tomates (4 slices), burger (make your own), seafood gumbo - soup special, brownie to go and one coffee.  The total was $40, without tip.

Tomato appetizer was very good but considerably overpriced ($7) for 4 slices.  Thankfully there were two of us so we each got two thin slices.

Seafood gumbo ($7) was very tasty, good seafood taste with a bit of spice.

Burger (arond $12?) was excellent served with the sweet potato fries.

Brownie (average size - around $3-$4?) to go was tasty as was the coffee (gingerbread) I had there.

Noticed they had a special pannani that caught my eye - tuna with wasbai mayo and cheddar with fries.  Waitress said the cost was $16.

Overall quality was very good but I also keep in mind that we are talking about a storefront cafe here.  That's just a little too much to pay regularly based on my pricbook for a storefront type of place.  I understand I am paying for local and organic but it just seems a little too high.

Service was very good.  Empty at 11:30 but totally filled when we left at 1:00.  I will go back albiet not rushing back and I will certainly buy one of the Yelp coupons to defry $10 from the bill.  If our meal was $30, I feel it would have been well worth it and I would have rated this 5 stars."}
{"text":"They have GREAT food. Fresh, local, organic food. I give only three stars because the service is terrible and is getting worse."}
{"text":"Disappointed on our most recent visit.  Something happened in the kitchen which caused the dining room to have a haze of smoke.  My salmon was excellent but the accompanying risotto was cold and sticky.  The server brought the bland soup well after the entree.  My companion's burger was good, but the fries were cold.  When the manager asked us if we needed anything and we asked for more water, he tersely replied that we were going to have to wait a few minutes.  $55 was too much for this experience."}
{"text":"Had a good dinner at Tree Hugger this week. Stopped in based on great Yelp reviews and always looking for a healthy alternative. I had a protein wrap and my wife had the bruschetta. We were both pleased; I thought the wrap was delicious. The guy working the counter was helpful in making suggestions and explaining the menu a bit.  We will make a return trip."}
{"text":"Great services and good food. I was never a been vegetarian or vegan eater. There are some things I am just not interested in trying but the more popular items are delicious. Sweet potato fries are always good to share. Great smoothies. Service is friendly. I am always willing to throw this place into the mix when suggesting places to eat around town"}
{"text":"I loved this place! This was the first time that I had been here and I was not disappointed. My friend and I almost got the exact same thing: the black bean burger, but with a few tweaks. She got the burger with the cheese and regular bread, and the three bean salad. I got the burger with no cheese, gluten-free bread, and the raw kale salad. YUM! We were both full and satisfied. 

The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is that it was a little pricey. I would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"Fabulous fabulous fabulous
The food wsa beyond amazing. The staff - owner and his wife as well as wait staff were so helpful 
We got Oatburgers which I still think about  ..and also had the Everything Cookies...I NEED that recipe! :)  We were from out of town and made a point to go two nights in a row. I could think of nothing wrong with the food or service..only one proble, they are in Ohio and I am in Massachusetts .The place rockks and EVERTYTIME I go to Ohio I will be at the Tree Hugger Cafe for a meal...."}
{"text":"Love this place!  They support local businesses and serve great food.  The tree hugger burger and sweet potato fries are awesome!  We drove to this place from interstate 80 and it was totally worth it. Easy on and off via Bagley road."}
{"text":"I'm incredibly disappointed. This was one of my favorite restaurants but after tonight I probably won't be coming back. We got there at about 10 after 7, they are supposed to close at 8. They turned us away at the door and said they couldn't take any more customers cause they were short staffed and trying to close. Never thought I'd see the day a restaurant would turn me away cause they were more concerned about leaving work on time than serving a loyal paying customer."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, I've been vegetarian nearly my whole life and generally love places like this. But I was incredibly disappointed. We had a rude waitress who seemed to have better things to do even though the place was nearly empty. The coffee was not good but I drank it anyway to be polite. The first two item I tried to order they were out of.. so then I went with a tofu butterfly sandwich and my boyfriend got some form of a burger. The decorative pine needles were cute however they made my entire meal taste like a pine tree!! Yuck. Both of us obviously did not enjoy our meal but none of the staff asked about it or if we were enjoying everything. We did not finish or take home our meals and then our waitress came by and took our plates and dropped off a check. She didn't offer dessert or refills and barely said a word. We paid the expensive bill and left vowing to never return. 
Maybe the server was just having a bad day. I get it. I'm a server too. But this was just plain annoying."}
{"text":"Delish! Excellent food, great place for getting a veggie/vegan option that doesn't include a boring veggie burger or plain salad. If you sign up for their text list they will send you coupons or other deals to use there regularly. Nice atmosphere, decent prices. Only downside is that the service is a little slow. Make sure you have at least an hour if you plan on eating there."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here for a while and finally got my chance last weekend. We came in around 12pm on a Sunday. The place was empty but by the end of our meal, there were lots of other diners. I value organic and local ingredients and usually choose to dine at places that source this way; I am used to paying substantially for quality food, it is nothing new to me. However that being said, I think this place is extremely pricey. It is not a fancy-pants, upscale restaurant. It is casual, earthy and hippie. The prices do not gel with the atmosphere. 

I ordered the Mediterranean Kale Salad with was a good size and very tasty and a cup of the soup of the day. My total for JUST me was something like $18. My 6 year old didn't feel predisposed to anything off of the kids menu, he is more of a 'rice and beans' kind of guy, and the only thing that appealed to him was a rice bowl which also cost $12. It was a nice sized portion although very salty, but it is RICE AND BEANS. There is no reason this should cost $12! It was at or below par with Chipotle, for twice the price. My partner got their Frisco Melt which he said was pretty good. For the 3 of us, our bill was over $50 for lunch!! Plus tip, we were out over $60. In my opinion, this is way too much. 

The service was fine and the food decent, but I live right down the street from The Root and can feed my family a lunch for under $30, same quality. I may buy the coupon to come here again, but probably not."}
{"text":"Outstanding hidden gem is the best way to describe this small but chic cafe which is popular on weekdays and weekends! I was introduced to it by Groupon even though I live 5 mins away only. Cafe-free carnivore breakfast panini once with chicken and once with bean party, and lemon chicken panini -all three with the yummy sweet potato fries--superb experience. On the weekend some kids were serving too, so a real family feel to the place with reasonably good background music. Service was good, not fast, but efficient and severs very pleasant. I will def be returning again and again and...... :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Staff is super friendly, and the variety is awesome!  Having a wheat allergy leaves me with only a few places that have quality options!  Treehuggers has TONS to choose from and is very accommodating!   Try the buckeye brownies!  Not only are the gluten free, but they are THE BEST brownies I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"Tree Hugger's you disappoint again.

My mom has been here twice in the past few months & raved and raved.  I thought to myself, Tree Hugger,'s you must have gotten it together & stepped it up.

Oh no you haven't....

Mom treated me to lunch post-church yesterday.  $40 for two?  Ummmm can we say pricey?  For two entree's, one side, and an appetizer (for which I had a coupon)  I think you're over-doing your $$ for what you're doing here.  I get that you're buying local & doing organic, but if you don't do it well.....

The service sucked.  The place was 3/4 full and there were two servers working the room and walk-ins for the register, and it looked like 2 people in the kitchen.  I had to walk my beverage up to the front to ask for refills, walk to the front to snag more napkins, and oh yeah the utensils I needed to eat with.

I ordered the chicken salad wrap & artichoke soup.  The soup was no-bueno with a gritty texture and an overly-powerful rosemary taste...so much so that I wondered if it was rosemary soup & not artichoke.  The wrap was large (yay!) and not too bad, but the chicken was dry and I wasn't given the opportunity to ask for some mustard or anything.  My mom ordered one of her favs...the black bean burger, which was huge, but DRY DRY DRY and not very hot either!  In fact, everything here was DRY!  Beans should not be dry.  Chicken should not be dry.  The black bean app that we ordered had good flavor & was probably the best thing of the meal, but again DRY!  And seriously, why are you deep-frying thick pita for chips?  Tree Hugger's if you are friend to the vegan, the vegetarian, the health-nut....why are you deep-frying?!

Again, you're not hitting on full-cylinders here.  It is a shame too.  The location sucks, and they don't even cater to their captive audience at the gym next door.  When you don't open until 10:30 am you miss your opportunity to make $$ on coffee, bakery, and smoothies to that 5am gym crowd.  I'm just saying.

I want to like you Tree Hugger's but you're too pricey, crappy service, and not good food just disappoint....every time."}
{"text":"I love this place! All of the little quirks and fun themes going on make it a great place To go. For sure to appease all tastes, the soups are amazing and service is always friendly and helpful . A+"}
{"text":"Oh Tree Huggers...... Why does everyone love you so much? I get that you have an awesome variety for vegetarians, vegans, and gluten free options but that about ends it for me....

We went there a few days ago because we had a Groupon. First off it is in kind of a weird location. The plaza is practically abandoned. We walked in at Fox 8 was there filming which was kind of cool but it also stunk because they didnt even ask if we minded being on camera. We sat down and the waitress said kind of that they wouldn't bother us. Which was good because we didn't mind them filming as long as they didnt film us. Well..... They did. 

The server was super nice and very informative. My boyfriend got the special which was a three cheese ravioli and i got the sea turtle lemon panini. When the food came out we were looking down at our plates when we looked up there was a camera right there! We waved them off and got into our meal. The ravioli was average and the sauce was watered down some. My panini didnt have any sort of lemon to it it was on a weird bun and it wasnt pressed at all. The bottom of the bread was a soggy and it was very bland. The dill cole slaw i had with it was eh. The only redeeming thing was the sweet potato fries and honey mustard dip with it. Yum yum yum. Other than that it was overpriced and mediocre at best. The only way i would go back is if i had another really good deal off."}
{"text":"I love this place! Healthy menu and everything is delicious! My only complaint is the price, but it doesn't stop me from driving 20 miles to get my fix."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, and I liked what I had. It was the artichoke wrap, it was tangy from the artichoke, but a little too buttery.  Good enough.  The coffee was fine.  I'm afraid I didn't see too much else on the menu I would even want to try so u probably won't go back.  That's just a personal taste issue though.  Also the service was a little slowish for a lunch.  I wish them the best in their business, but this place is not for me."}
{"text":"Can I hug Treehugger's Cafe?

Went hiking w the BF near the falls and wanted to grab dinner somewhere. Maybe it was nature, fresh air, or the mini-bottles of bacardi we snuck in my backpack, but we were both feeling adventurous and hippy-ish. Much to my surprise, my football watching, gun carrying, mans-man of a boyfriend suggested Treehugger's Cafe, which is rich with vegan and vegetarian options along with locally sourced and humanely raised beef, and I immediately thought he contracted some kind of weird poison ivy that made it's way to his brain...

Treehuggers has a cute little set up. The decor is warm and inviting. Contemporary chandeliers hang above the comfy wooden booths as beautiful local artwork adorns the walls. Our waiter was so friendly and personable. Although pricey, everything was worth it. I got a black bean burger that was out of this world...best black bean burger I've ever had. Boyfriend had a burger and it was also delicious. It took some time for our food to come out, but again, WELL worth the wait. Exceeded my expectations. 

I'll see you again, Treehugger's! *hugs*"}
{"text":"Very poor service.   I waited 31 minutes (yes I was counting)  for my *to go* order and I had ordered a chicken burger (nothing fancy).  The sweet potato fries were completely soggy and the mustard sauce was nothing to write home about.  The worst part about the service was I even tipped them for my order (because I tipped before the order arrived). Now the worse is yet to come, there were about 5 people who came in after I did and all of them got their food before I did and why?  Because I was sitting on a chair not standing in their faces like others were!   

I would have given them one star but they were saved due to the mediocrity of others who I have rated one star.   Won't go again, won't recommend."}
{"text":"My decision to give this place a second try was an excellent one. After having a recent experience with  the brilliant array of restaurants in California that can accommodate both dietary restrictions AND the desire to eat well, my gratitude for Tree Huggers is so much greater. They are one of the only places on the West-West side of Cleveland that can boast many vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free options. Thankful for this place forging the way for healthy and tasty food to be established in this area!"}
{"text":"It is a trendy spot, however slow service and a little disorganized. Interesting interior and good food."}
{"text":"This is a really great place to eat if they actually have all of the menu items. They seem to always be out of food! The quality is still great though... it's just really annoying to support this cafe and always have to adjust to what they have in stock."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite hidden gems. Tree Huggers served locally sourced food before it was a real \"thing\" in Northeastern Ohio. 

The menu is simple: Wraps, Salads, and Burgers and ever changing entree specials. They offer lots of gluten free and vegan options. I love the soups, the tomato in particular. And the Tuna Stuffed Avocado Salad...oh my. So simple and healthy, yet delish! But not everything is \"healthy.\" They serve seasoned fresh cut fries and sweet potato fries if you are fixin' for some deep fried Americana. They have a coffee shop inside the restaurant, too, that serves up yummy hot and cold concoctions.

They remodeled fairly recently and made better use of space to allow more diners. Decor is simple and clean, almost with an upscale diner feeling.

All in all, a great place to go when you want something that is mostly local and organic. Vegan AND carnivores will be happy here."}
{"text":"Great concept. However, the quality of the food preparation is inconsistent. Limited attention to details. Ambiance and location is disappointing.  UPDATE: have gone back a number of times this past year and found better consistency in the food preparations and attention to details. And decor has been updated. i like having this kind of restaurant on the west side of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Food was delicious damn. Portions were big. Place was coZy and a nice place to stop  in a cold and blisterry day.

We will definitely tell friends about this place and be back for more."}
{"text":"We started with a basket of sweet potato fries which were the best part of the meal. Very good. Then I had the grilled chicken panini. It wasn't very good. A little dry. There was plenty of chicken. Enough for two sandwiches it seemed but not a lot else. I felt like I was just eating a big piece of grilled chicken. The bf got the Mushroom panini which was very good. Both of us got the side which was a dill slaw. Neither of us liked it at all."}
{"text":"This was a very sad and terrible experience. We brought family in from out of town and the coffee was weak, appetizer was small and bland, the enters got burnt and smoked the whole restaurant, and the entire barely eatable. We also waits almost 45 minutes for any food. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  Food was excellent.  The sweet potato fries were the best I ever have had.  Also enjoyed a smoothy. It was a full house when we arrived but the food proved out to be worth the wait."}
{"text":"Fabulous, locally inspired cuisine! Each time we've visited we've enjoyed a great meal. From appetizers to dessert each course was excellent, and only matched by quality service. Even during a bad winter spell, they  were kind enough to expedite a takeout order so I could beat the storm and make it home safe. And the icing on the cake is always the must have seasonally inspired cookies!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Yelp Deal. $10 got me $20. Score! Always keep a lookout for Deals & Checkin offers.

I'm ok with granola and the veganvegetarianglutenfreeraworganic options. I'm willing to explore and try new stuff.Yeah.

The place is cozy and I didn't really spend too much time trying to break down the layout, but it was comfortable and the folks were friendly.

Me: I'll have the sweet potato quinoa sandwich.
Waitress: You have a choice of (the usual) sides, and we also have a seaweed salad.
Me: Oh, wakame sounds good.
Waitress: What's that?
Me: Um..I'll have that seaweed salad.

The sweet potato fries were very good and  the little one approved of her bowl of Gorilla Granola. I also enjoyed the mint green tea. Delicious.

As a coupon-clipping discount shopper, I probably wouldn't have been enticed to consider checking this place out, but I'm glad that I did. The menu pricing may be somewhat Moderate to Spendy for some, but the quality of ingredients and value for portioning seems relatively fair. Besides, you're usually getting what you pay for with healthier eats."}
{"text":"Refreshing and delicious! We had the hummus wrap, protein wrap and farmer's market raw salad- all really good with high quality produce. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"What an interesting location for a veggie-friendly restaurant. I was staying in North Olmsted for work and needed something healthy to get me over my jet lag and airport-fooditis. My colleague and I had a hard time finding the place - it's a teeny tiny part of a bigger building that houses what I think is a gym. 

Positives: vegan and gluten-free items are clearly labeled on the menu, the food is fresh, and there are lots of options sure to please anyone you dine with.

Negatives: our server had no idea that the restaurant was running a promotion with Yelp and couldn't answer any of our questions (it seems like management should inform the staff), and the restaurant is a throwback to the '70s with dim lighting. 

I would go again, especially since there are not many veggie-friendly restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I've given Tree Huggers three tries. All three were strikes and this place is out. 

Visit 1. I bought $40 for $20 on Mimi's Deals. My bf and I went for coffee and to use the tables to work on our homework. We bought a bunch of stuff to go. We noticed that the pound of coffee we bought was not included. It's a 15 mile drive, so I called. They told me to call back when the manager was in the next day. I called the next day, they suggested I use the \"contact me\" on their website. I gave it a week and never heard back so I called. They basically called me a liar. $$$ down the drain. 

2. I stopped in with my friend who is from Berea but moved ten years ago. We wanted to buy a water and a cafe mocha. It took 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge me. Then someone said hi, took my order and 20 minutes later I had a mocha. 30 minutes for a mocha? It wasn't even good. 

3. I stopped in for coffee and cookies with a friend. We sat down and no one came out to greet us for a half hour. We left. 

I bought 3 deals from Mimi. I gave the rest to a friend who lives closer. It's out of the way for me. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Out here from Los Angeles and realized last year finding healthy food was a struggle. My mom and I tried this place and wished we could eat here the whole time. Both our meals were fantastic and the service was absolutely wonderful. Prices were really good for local/organic and Im always willing to pay more for that. The cookies are so good and i snacked off it for 2 days it was so big. One of the best dining experiences Ive had."}
{"text":"Awesome food that makes you feel Good! Great service! Love the dandelion detox iced tea."}
{"text":"A medium long brown hair was in my food today. In the coleslaw. Went on a Saturday afternoon and it was really noisy .Someone in the back was dropping pans and doors were being slammed shut. Not usual for this place. Had the zucchini panini. It was good. No grill marks on the panini. Cheese was melted ok.   Let down"}
{"text":"I've been here many times. Food is 'hit or miss\" Not always as good as the last time. It must depend on who is cooking."}
{"text":"Delicious Organic food whether it is a burger or their fresh salads. Price is right and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Bad service. Bad food. Unethical. Lie about it being organic and locally sourced. An employee who worked there told me most of it comes from GFS and Drugmart."}
{"text":"Although we entered as they were going tough the renovation process, this place definitely lived up to what I thought it would be. We ordered two salads to go and while we waited my daughter and I shared the vegan mint chocolate cookie. Absolutely amazing !  My daughter ordered a smoothie and was also delicious !! The staff there was amazing and I got to meet the owner. I was thrilled to hear they were franchising and may one day look to bring this restaurant out to the east side. Great place ! 

Oh also have a really cute patio and a cute kids menu !!!!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this spiteful review as I travel from this place. Wow. What a waste TL;DR- tasteless overpriced food provided by careless people.

Out in the area, and trying to take care of some stuff. Hungry, and having muscle, I need protein. For being a \"healthful\" place, they don't have their food labeled for what is what. What's vegetarian? What's vegan? What's whatever the trend of the day is? 

So found what looked the least gross. To note, I am at 10 months being animal free. I'm not new to this lifestyle, and pretty easily eat at most places. So I ask about \"Peyton's Protein Wrap.\" How much protein? The guy playing with his phone didn't know. The guy sweeping didn't know, \"Like, nutrition stuff? We don't know that.\"

Okie dokie. So I get a \"Protein Muffin\" as well.

14 dollars. Fourteen. Dollars. 

Asking what the \"side varies\" is, they suggested the Kale Salad. When I ordered my main dish with no onions, clearly they didn't take the hint I don't like onions. Because their is more onion than anything else. It is onion with green pieces. So, spit that out pretty quickly. 

Was the main meal any better? The first half was bland. The \"seasoned beans\" are seasoned with anti bean flavoring. So a good job making the beans not taste like beans (seriously; I don't like beans). The taste was replaced with mush. No taste. So I got a hint of tomato, and warm mush for the first half. The second half gave me a special treat! 

I hate peppers. Peppers and onions make my stomach turn. No peppers on the menu. . . But I assume they didn't clean where they make wraps, and that's how pepper got into my wrap. 

So that was spit out. I washed it down with a tasteless $4 muffin. Wow, did I waste $14. I should have gotten a salad at McDonald's and some bags of peanuts."}
{"text":"I'll preface this review by saying I've never written a negative review, I'm a yogini and an uncommonly kind person...maybe this place had an off day but this was my experience. I walked into the place, nobody said a word to me, not even a smile. After looking over the menu briefly I was ready to order, I made direct eye contact with the guy behind the counter...He. Walked. Away. then came back and said 'I'll be with you in a moment. HE Never Came Back!! Another employee saw me waiting and took my order. Ok so that's not that bad right? So I ordered a beet salad, it took 25 minutes or so to get that and when I got it, it looked like something you get from a diner, not a heath conscious cafe. It was not inventive or delicious and cost $10! I won't patronize this place again, not because of one so-so dish, but a combination of lacking warm service(which I expect from a cozy place called treehuggers), ambiance and good food. This was just my experience, still stop by and maybe things would have changed. Blessings!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised how good this place is, I mean that in a good way. I am not a vegan or vegetarian either. This place has a lot of great food (Meat as well). I got the chicken wrap, and was very happy with the purchase.

Got to get their deserts, there amazing!."}
{"text":"Flies swarmed our table so we asked to move and had to move ourselves without any offer of help. Sadly, they ran out of the black bean patty that we came here for after reading all the reviews. Another patron complained and left because her food was taking so long. (The restaurant was not busy at all.). Our server was inattentive but another one was nice enough and helped us out when I flagged him down. The redeeming factor for our server was that he took the soup I ordered off the bill since it was still full on the table when we got our bill as I was not a fan.  I found it to be very bland. The burger was good, and so were the sweet potato fries. I like that they gave a honey mustard dipping sauce.  The chocolate hazelnut scone was HUGE (the size of a toddler's head) and tasty.  It may've been vegan too.  Overall food was decent. I wish I could've tried the black bean patty everyone raves about. Maybe if we are in the area again I will get it to go."}
{"text":"tl;dr: I could have bought a cow, raised it from birth in a beautiful farm that I spent 30 years saving up for, learned how to use that cow to make meat myself, done the deed, and made myself that burger BEFORE I got my food at this restaurant.

Absolute worst dining experience I have had in such a long time if not ever. Came there around 6:10ish and ordered an appetizer and four entrees (burgers to begin with). Appetizer came in a moderately timely manner about 30-35 minutes. 

Then the fun started. Around 7:15 our waiter comes over and says that the chef is new and lost our receipt originally and is now working on the food it'll be a little late. Fine by us. Twenty minutes go by. Waiter comes over and says he is so sorry it'll be about 3-4 more minutes. No problem with us. Waiter comes back in ten minutes and says that the food is ready he just has to pick it up and bring it to the table. Waited about another five minutes and went up and asked the status of our food, best part the waiter who had two tables couldn't even recognize my face and wondered what table I even sat at. The hostess then came by and said \"I'll be honest with you your food isn't even half done\".  Meanwhile a table that came in almost an hour after us had their food already. At that point of sitting for two hours we just left, angry and hungry.

Got told our food was ready and just waiting for pick up being blatantly lied to, blatantly ignored by our waiter who really should have just told us the food was nowhere near done and to save two hours of our lives.

I can understand understaffed or new kitchens, it happens. Two hours to wait for four burgers is unacceptable in any way and I can honestly say (not that they care) I will never come back again."}
{"text":"The attraction of this place is based entirely on their relentless appeals to their namesake treehugger fans. Unfortunately, all of their food looks and tastes like the ingredients were purchased at the Aldi store down the street. Irregardless, if you wish to pay $12 for a salad that is 50% parsley served on a 4 inch plate or $10 for a slice of processed American cheese on a slice of slightly toasted commercial white bread, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Food was good, portions were small. It's a premium price for quality food, just wish there was more of it. Service was SLOW. Not to get the food but to get ordered, water, check and pay...and he never once came back to check on us after dropping off the food. I don't know if we will return"}
{"text":"I would give 3 stars for the actual taste of the food that I've ordered and 4 stars for the convenience!"}
{"text":"Tried Tree Huggers this week for the first time. It was very good, everything was as expected. I ordered the tuna wrap with a cucumber salad. The kombucha was a local Cleveland brew. I will be back."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm kinda impressed!! Just went and they did a little remodeling from the last time I went last review) you have a clear vision once you enter and there right in front A HOSTESS STAND!!  And guess what a host was waiting to seat us!? Omg is this a miracle of a yelp review read?? I don't know and I've only been back once since BUT not only did we get sat right away, our waitress came over a minute later to take drink orders...wtf my head was spinning! yes at the time we were the only patrons but when lunch hour hit our waitress was still attentive along with the host alway refilling our coffee and water. Food took a bit of time which was expected but when you are sat right away, drinks and food ordered,  you have the TIME to wait a little on food which again was delicious. Check came out timely, didn't have to ask and it was processed fast. I am super impressed. 
The new look, the hostess stand it all makes sense to the customer. It looks like a cute restaurant I want to eat at and now want to come back to whereas before it was just too
chaotic and just not worth it even though food was great. 
This place can be great-there is no other health food restaurant in the area like this, I hope the owner doesn't take this lightly it could be GREAT if they can keep this up, don't fall back on old ways I will start recommending this place to my friends again telling them it has changed for the good!"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and am always looking out for Veggie friendly restaurants. This was a famous one. We ordered a veggie cheese grill and a mushroom black bean burger and coffee. Both the sandwiches were extremely dry and did not have salt or for that matter too much taste. It was good in terms of being filling and a very decent size portion and lot of content but still too dry. Not that excited to go back sadly."}
{"text":"Very disappointed upon my most recent visit here. The place was completely empty. I needed a bigger booth to accommodate my baby's carrier and the host gave me an extremely difficult time about it.  If the place had been busier, I wouldve understand. But there was no one else there. He even said I could sit there but he might have to ask me to move later.  Seriously?!?? To be clear, we were there for 30 minutes before another customer arrived (a party of 3).  

Food was good. Got the black bean burger. It was a tad dry but sweet potato fries were yummy. And I really enjoyed the nachos.  Our server was great. He separated the meat and beans which was appreciated. I will go back because I like the food but I'm hoping they are more accommodating when the restaurant is empty!

Original review: 

Great place for lunch even though the location is not convenient unless you live close by. It's a little expensive for the portions but likely due to everything being organic. I was willing to pay because it was very good!  I enjoyed a grilled cheese that had a delicious red pesto spread. Also enjoyed the cucumber salad on the side. My friend ordered a salad which looked amazing so I'll be getting that next time! Also looking forward to trying a vegan dessert.  This is another place on my healthy places to eat list!"}
{"text":"Super yummy veggie options, and meat friendly if you're into that, too. I had the roasted beet salad with Gorgonzola, walnuts, mint and honey lemon with a dandelion detox iced tea...Superb!"}
{"text":"Veganized the 3 bean nacho dip & loved it. Very unique dip. Loved the seasoning. Was the size of a whole meal in my opinion. Ran out of pita bread & was brought more at no charge. Fresh cut fries were amazing! Bean burger arrived & was much larger than expected! Love that! Took it home! Excellent friendly service. Would definately recommend this restaurant to friends!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since the actual visit, but I took the family here with a groupon I had and it was worth it.  The food was mostly natural and/or organic which is preferred.  They also had fresh pastries to pick from which my little one enjoyed.   The place was kid friendly and the food was tasty.  

It is a little hard to find if you are not familiar with the area and it's kind of in an unexpected place.  The fact that it is in the same complex as a fitness center is very smart with the rejuvenated health kick in today's society."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start! I'm so happy this place exists! They have excellent food, baked goods, and staff. The atmosphere is so comfy and adorable and welcoming. If you come while they still have the pumpkin quesadilla you must get it! Everything I had is delicious. I can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"I absolutely lived here during college at BW. Great on all accounts. I even surprised people by having them try the best vegan cookies I've ever seen"}
{"text":"In a word; terrible. It's a never again for me. EVER. 

My girlfriend and I visited Tree Huggers this past Sunday afternoon after looking for something new, and having read the multiple positive reviews on Yelp. 

My first impression was that the place was a bit dirty. Not filthy, but what I would call \"divey\" (e.g. crumbs on the table, cafeteria type chairs, etc.). 

We were seated at a table and waited; for a good 4-5 minutes. Our server arrived and offered us drinks. We both ordered water and my girlfriend ordered one of the smoothies. A few minutes later another server dropped off our waters (almost in the literal sense, and rather unpleasantly). Thankfully we didn't see her again. 

Our primary server returned and took our meal orders. I ordered the egg and sausage panini, and my girlfriend ordered the salmon and kale salad. The \"panini\" is actually just toast. The salmon on her salad was completely overcooked. This thing had been murdered. No chef would serve that salmon under any circumstance. 

Dirty, subpar service and subpar food. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Food: The food here is fantastic. I will be back just because of the cinnamon sweet potato fries. Everything else was also good, though. So what did we order?
-Cinnamon sweet potato fries with honey mustard
-Beast burger, gluten free bread
-\"Custom salad\"
-Ginger peach tea

Overall Experience:
-Very helpful courteous employees
-Our waitress was enthusiastic about us getting exactly what we wanted.
-Quick to be seated

5 Stars for awesomeness!"}
{"text":"I went to Tree Huggers Cafe for lunch using a Groupon I had purchased and I must say I was a bit disappointed.  The location is a bit unusual since I figured this would be close to Baldwin Wallace, but instead THC is located in an industrial area; the strip of shops is set way back from the road and is easy to miss.  THC is a single storefront at the end of the strip.  Inside you find a small cafe with an eclectic decor, by the ceiling is still industrial, ground level is an interesting mix that works well.  

The menu offers a healthy take on a cafe menu, with a decent amount of variety.  I ended up ordering the Tuna Wrap with a bowl of cream of mushroom soup and a side of the sweet potato fries.  The cream of mushroom soup was a miss, there was plenty of mushrooms but the broth was quite bland and lacked in flavor.   The tuna wrap was nicely put together and the vegies were crisp, but the the tuna was also lacking in flavor and were not properly drained.  The best item was the large portion of well fried sweet fries; nicely complemented by the mustard based dipping sauce.  I wish more of the food would have been as flavorful as the dipping sauce.

Service was good  especially considering there was a single server for the whole cafe.  I wanted to like Tree Huggers, but I generally found the food to be bland and boring."}
{"text":"I had been a frequenter at Tree Huggers, admiring their organic philosophy, until my visit today. I will never be back. Ever. Let me tell you a little story... 

1. When first entering Tree Huggers and perusing the specials board, my sister and I were intrigued that a macaroni and cheese bowl was listed (yum). No other description was given for this dish. Naturally, we decided to get some more info. from our server. 

On top of that, Tree Huggers usually has a list of sides for the day. I was curious about those as well. 

We received our drinks and proceeded to ask about the specials. When my sister politely asked for more information on the macaroni and cheese bowl, hoping to know if it contained anything special, was told \"it's just a big bowl of mac and cheese.\"  Ok, great, super helpful! 

Next was my turn, I asked about the sides of the day. Again, the super helpful server listed off the sides, providing no descriptions for them, staring at us impatiently. OF COURSE, we could've asked for more description, but we felt uncomfortable and shamed for even asking. 

2. I settled on a chicken salad wrap, while my sister decided to go with the mushroom panini. 

When served my chicken salad, I noticed it was missing several ingredients. On the menu, it is supposedly made with \"Organic white meat pulled chicken with red globe grapes, homemade
candied walnuts in a lemon tarragon marsala reduction served on a whole
grain wrap, with lettuce tomato and onion. Side dish varies.\" Instead, I was given a wrap with chicken, celery, onions, romaine lettuce, and a broken, bland, tasteless sauce. No grapes, no walnuts, no tomato, no sauce(???). I was extremely disappointed. 

As for my sister, her mushroom panini was lacking the basil pesto sauce described on the menu: an integral ingredient. Again, it was bland and tasteless. 

Both of us work in a restaurant and didn't want to be a pain. However, I took my wrap inside and politely told my server about the missing ingredients. He tried to reason that \"well, we change the chicken salad daily - we throw in whatever we have for the day,\" ok, great, then put that on the menu maybe? He then proceeded to say \"I can bring you some grapes on the side.\" 

*Forehead slap* 

At this point, we were both getting a bit fired up. Desperate for some flavor, I asked the server for some kind of mayo based sauce, while he brought the \"a little too late\" side of grapes. 

3. Thank god, the side of basil mayo made the wrap decent!!! My sister only consumed half of her sandwich. Once we had finished, we gained the courage to ask for a manager to discuss our dreadful situation. Since we felt SUPER uncomfortable with our current server, we flagged down the hostess. We asked her for a manager and she, SHOCKINGLY, told us that our server WAS the manager.

I'm sorry, but that's a sick joke.

4.  BECAUSE our total bill was almost 40 dollars - for depressing service, for a wrap I could've prepared better myself, a bland panini, and one mango tea. NOT worth it. You'd be better off visiting one of the many organic/farm to table restaurants around the Cleveland area (e.g. Spice, Cleveland Vegan, Urban Farmer, Rebol, Luxe, etc. etc). DO NOT waste your time or money here!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were on a road trip from Boston to Cedar Point, and were getting hungry.  Armed with a smartphone, I was excited to try out its super powers of location.  As an experiment, I typed in \"vegetarian restaurant\" into the maps app, and was shocked to find that there was one (and only one) right off the highway!  

I glanced at the menu online, and it seemed to be reasonably priced with 9 dollar burgers, and have a good amount of veg/non-veg options for everyone.

We get there and sit down, and the reasonably prices I thought I saw were all crossed out and increased by about 33%.  That 9 dollar black bean burger I wanted was now 12, the meaty ones my friends got were 14.  All together we got a side of bruchetta (9.95), a couple of burgers, and a wrap sandwich.  

The food took at least 45 minutes to come out to us, the bread for the bruschetta ran out before the bruschetta. Given there wasn't that much of either, that wasn't so keen... The bean burger was pretty bland, though not as mushy as others I have eaten, and I nearly missed the one scant slice of avocado on it (my friend with the wrap couldn't even see hers).  The bite I had of the beef burger was quite good, and they were BIG, though one friend complained that his the medium order was def't on the bloody rare side.  The bread all of this was on was pretty fantastic, I will give it that... 

Also they say they use mostly all organics and what not, but on the way back from the bathroom you could see the cans of conventional coconut milk, with Roland brand, which uses chemical preservatives. Coconut milk is an item that is pretty easy to get in organic, so I'm left wondering what else wasn't organic...  I know many similar style restaurants will let you know either what items are _not_ organic, or what items are %100 organic.

All in all, the service was slow and it was way over priced.  So, 4 sandwiches/burgers, 1 app, and no drinks was 80 dollars with tax and tip!  Srsly?  I am from Boston and that would be pretty damn expensive here.

It seems like, from some other reviews, they've been on a bit of a decline.  So, as pained as I am to give a place that jibes with my values 2 stars... I can't say I would really recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Great place. I'm no hippy and have no really strong food ethics to speak of, but it was incredibly refreshing to taste the subtleties of real food for once."}
{"text":"Living in the midwest is lovely, but I do miss many things about the west coast, including all of the little bistros and restaurants and street musicians, and that vibe that makes Seattle so great.

Treehugger's Cafe transported me back to the place inside of me that naps during sticky Ohio summers and applies hand lotion again and again during the cold dry winter months. Everything about this space (the ambiance, the menu, the staff, the cafe's commitment to local agriculture and organic farming) made that inside place come alive.  

Last week, my friend and I shared an eggplant panini and a black bean burger with a sweet cinnamony carrot salad on the side.  The panini was my favorite of the two sandwiches, but that pretzel bread surrounding the black bean burger was pretty tasty.  

While I may have to drive a ways to get here, and it might not be surrounded by six coffeeshops, mountains, or unshaven bike messengers, I do appreciate the effort.  Treehugger's Cafe will be there when I need my northwest fix."}
{"text":"We had a coke and hot chocolate. And sweet potato fries served with ketchup and hot mustard. Meh. Super cute decor, though.

My next visit was a total hit. I got ale-battered cod strips with fries. He got hamburger with slaw. We finished with chocolate peanut butter fudge vegan cake. All were amazing. I would definitely visit again for the meal food."}
{"text":"Great mission, cute space, great food! Side of kale salad was excellent!"}
{"text":"Super sweet owner... gave me several refills on the Red Cedar Pecan Rum flavored coffee that was pretty tasty!  Some nice vegan options here and all but one item on this evening's desserts menu were vegan!  I had the artichoke vegan wrap and it was served warm with some roasted veggies inside. I think I would've preferred more artichokes in the wrap but I was glad to find a vegan-friendly restaurant out here. My chocolate chunk cookie didn't have enough chocolate so I wouldn't name it chocolate chunk.  It was softer than what I imagined it would be so that was a plus."}
{"text":"I found this place traveling for work and I'm so glad I did! Traveling every week as an organic food eating vegetarian can be difficult where dining is concerned. The only problem here was deciding what food to get. The service was great! And the food was fresh and delicious! I got the Scarlett macaw cranberry walnut salad full of organic greens, home made dressing, and veggies freshly cut. If I wasn't pleased enough there, I also got the pleasure of consuming a vegan chocolate chunk cookie that was HUGE and amazing!! Best I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"Wow, Treehugger's Café.  Cool little joint.  Health conscious. Vegan & Vegetarian welcoming and friendly.  Very good blend of tastes.  I ordered a vegan black bean burger. It was awesome! The sandwiches here come with a cool little bagel bun.  Awesome sweet potato fries with dipping sauce.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Locally roasted Red Cedar coffee and delicious menu. Mash up of hippy and country, healthy and hospitality. Gluten free and fried tomaters."}
{"text":"Awesome! Love all the healthy options! Got the black bean cactus burger with seaweed salad...all delicious! Service was very pleasant, food came out fast, presentation was appealing. I will definitely be back to this place when I visit next."}
{"text":"I don't make my way out to this area very often and was just looking for a quick bite to eat. The restaurant was a lot nicer and had a lot more character than I was expecting it to for its location. The service was very polite and fast. I was feeling picky that day and and ordered asked for them to prepare my burger a certain way and swap out sides and my server made it happen without skipping a beat! The patty in the jalapeño burger (it had a name that I don't recall) had so much flavor, it was almost surreal.  Their coffee was very tasty as well. Overall great food for a good price. This place would be a nice for a date."}
{"text":"I love this place! After being diagnosed with celiac and having to eat gluten free, my friend took me to this place and I fell in love! 
They have great, fresh, healthy good food! They have gluten free bread and support local businesses! They even had gluten free brownies! 
I suggest the sea turtle lemon chicken sandwich and kale salad!!"}
{"text":"A tiny gem worth visiting!  Yesterday there were 9 of us who enjoyed quiche, tomato basil soup, fried green tomatoes (VERY good), salads and their lovely brewed teas.  Fresh and delicious - with attentive & personable servers.  We'll be back ..."}
{"text":"Why anyone would ever consider going here more than once is beyond me.  There are so many things wrong with this place I can only attempt to remember them, and that was just 45 minutes ago!   My wife and I had to ask for more than just the provided fork.  No place to put a spent teabag after the tea steeped, there were no napkins.  Neither bathroom had paper towels.
  The server was nice enough, he was fine overall however he would have been more attentive if not on his cell phone constantly.  
   There was a special avocado and pita appetizer we tried.  It had no flavor at all.  A plain avocado has some flavor but this must have been refrigerated to rob it of any taste at all.  No lemon, no spice, no salt, the topping of tomato chunks nearly frozen.  And it was, like everything else here, overpriced for what you get. Black bean burger, stone cold.  My wife's dish was also cold.  We both ordered french fries - I think they might have had some taste if they weren't also cold.  How could these dishes be made fresh to order if they were cold six steps from the kitchen?
   There were two other tables occupied at the time.  It's not like the person cooking would have had their \"timing thrown off.\"  
  I notice now as I'm writing this that they are closed by 8pm.  if they closed until 2023 I wouldn't mind."}
{"text":"Excellent presentation of the food, very good quality and tasty as well. I am from California and was surprised to see such a great vegan/ organic cafe in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Eric's Beastie Burger is amazing! Homemade BBQ sauce, fried gorgonzola wedge, roasted red peppers and grass-fed meat, all on an awesome pretzel bun! Perfection!"}
{"text":"Tried the Beastie Burger- it was awesome! I would highly recommend this place to anyone with a mixed party. Ate here with my vegan in-laws and everyone was happy!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this cafe has gone down the tubes. We used to come here all the time. But since new owners have taken over the place is dirty, the menu has changed, and products that come out are not well made. I ordered a chai and not only did it come out in an extra large cup and completely watered down but it was lukewarm at best. We used to come on Sunday nights and they would run out of all the ingredients for over half of their menu options. The employees don't know the ingredients in their menu's and for someone who is gluten free and has a lot of food allergies this used to be a good spot.... I'm sad it no longer is."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I am not vegetarian or vegan or gluten free. I merely
Tried this restaurant because we got a great group on deal for it. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by this place! All of he food we ordered was so fresh and delicious. I was ordered the food would taste sort of bland as what happens with a lot of healthy dishes, but this was definitely NOT the case. We even got some of their baked goods to go. I think everyone should give this a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had lunch today here with a coworker.  The restaurant was fairly busy and it is small but it was later so we had no problem getting a nice booth mid room.  I would like to brag that I always try to eat local, organic, raw, vegan, fresh, etc. but that is not the case as evidenced by my other gluttonous reviews.  All that said, I thought the food was fantastic.  The menu had a lot of different choices but as per usual I ordered one of the daily specials.  I opted for the squash stew and asparagus quiche and my coworker had a kale salad and a portabella mushroom panini.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  The waiter was attentive and friendly.  The menu warns you that fresh food takes longer but we were served fairly quickly.  I had several refills of fresh iced mint tea which was really tasty.  I will definately return."}
{"text":"Let me put it this way: We drove from Buffalo, NY for their food. The 1st time we were so overwhelmed with how delicious their food was that we had to go back a couple months later!! Gluten free brownies that are ENORMOUS and heavenly! All of their food is beyond fantastic!"}
{"text":"Sorry, Treehugger's. I loved you when you first opened, and I hope you manage to find your mojo, but my last few visits haven't been so spectacular. 

I used to get take out every other week after volunteering at a local animal shelter, but week after week the food I'd bring home would be greasy or over-seasoned. 

I dined in this past Saturday with a friend and had the tortilla soup. It was pretty good, and I loved the Breadsmith roll that came with it. For my meal, I ordered one of the winter specials, the butternut squash enchiladas. I love just about anything made out of squash and I like enchiladas, so I figured I couldn't go wrong. 

But it did go wrong. The enchiladas weren't fresh. You could tell they'd been cooked in some large pan and were just scooped out, slightly reheated, and put on a plate. And I would have been pretty much ok with that if they hadn't been over spiced. I don't even know what spice was used in the enchilada sauce, but it was so overpowering it prevented me from eating more than half of my meal. 

I might wait a while to go back and get grub from Treehugger's, but I still love the vegan baked goods. And maybe a new spring menu will do the place some good."}
{"text":"I have never had anything from here that I didn't love!! Great food, great people and love the atmosphere. They frequently have live music as well!"}
{"text":"A nice little cafe that makes an attempt at serving healthy food; this is pretty much my wife's favorite place in Berea, and I'm also quite fond of it.  It does cater to vegetarians and raw-food diners, but they also serve omnivores; they are usually clear about what is and is not vegan, contains gluten, or whatever.  They have a regular menu, but the thing to get is usually the special of the day.
Excellent pumpkin soup, when it's on the menu, and I'm fond of the stuffed squash and the pumpkin lasagna."}
{"text":"Happened to be in the strongsville area for a conference and read about TreeHuggers on Yelp.
Yes, I agree the food seems a little high priced for the environment, but NOT for the quality.  Everything was fresh and homemade.  Bonus points for the vegan items like the chocolate chip cookie!
Crab cake special was phenomenal.  Really really good.  That came with    a soup, creamy tomato basil, for $18.
I ate the black bean burger on a soft pretzel bun with raw kale salad side for $12.  My husband had the hell burger, (spicy), with fries for $14.
The black bean was amazing.  Truly like a real beef burger in consistency and w eloped the pretzel buns!
Add three iced teas and a bowl of delicious sweet potato fries onto that and you've got $70.  (oh, and two power muffins to go for breakfast tomorrow)
I thought it was worth every penny ad would go back at any time to ry the other temptations:  sweet potato & quinoa burger!!!???

It just happens to be our  16th anniversary and we ended up there by accident and so happy we did!"}
{"text":"I have heard so many great things about Tree Huggers, and wanted to check it out for myself so popped in with my parents. They use organic for almost all of their menu, and they had loads of vegan and gluten free options. 

My dad and I started with the soup du jour --- 
\"What is the soup du jour?\" 
\"It's the soup of the day.\" 
\"Mmm, that sounds good. I'll have that.\" 

It was tomato basil - very tasty with a nice little kick. They served it with a rosemary bread.

I had one of the 5 daily specials: quinoa and sweet potato burger, on a pretzel roll with the bean salad as a side. It was awesome! The rest of our group loved their food, too. For dessert, we pretty much ordered one of everything in the dessert cooler :) 

The everything cookie was fabulous, I also tried my husband's carrot cake cookie. Both were vegan - bonus!! 

Also, when I checked in to Yelp, I got a 20% off coupon that we were able to use right away - double bonus!! 

The service was great, and the restaurant was cute and super clean.  

As a side note: they have a drive through to pick up your to go order. I love it and will definitely have to remember that next time we need healthy food to go!"}
{"text":"Quality of the food is good.  I don't recommend coming here with a large group...my personal experience took waaaay too long for a lunch outing.  Food is \"A-OK\""}
{"text":"Though non-descript from the ouside, this bright and cute place offers a variety of healthy vegan, vegetarian and organic local foods, including daily and seasonal specials. We visited yesterday and sampled the hummus appetizer (Morrocan style- with olives and tomatoes) with plenty of pita and veggie dippers - tasty and fresh. We drank the unsweetened ginger-peach tea - very refreshing and crisp. A seasonal salad of butternut squash, goat cheese, oranges, candied walnuts and organic chicken breast with balsamic dressing over fresh greens was excellent. The local chicken was suprisingly flavorful compared to boring grocery store fare. A portabella, carmelized onion and pesto panini with buffalo mozzerella was gooey and tasty aand came with a mixed bean salad side (with several other fresh sides to choose from). Local roasted organic coffee and a big chocolate chunk cookie topped off a nice dining experience. We took home some items from their small selection of fresh bakery - huge and heavy \"super muffins\" and scones. Our server was pleasant, attentive, and answered all question about the source and content of dishes. A \"green\" place all around, worthy of your buisiness. I found their naming of dishes after endangered species (none included in the dish, of course!) kind of funny."}
{"text":"One shouldn't expect a largely vegetarian restaurant to present a shining example of a cheeseburger, and Tree huggers is not a surprise on that level. My burger was just shy of well done instead of medium, and it wasn't the tastiest, but it was pretty okay.  

On the other hand, the sweet potato fries and my banana-espresso smoothie were pretty great, and everyone who joined me seemed to love their food.

The menu and the server emphasized that they would cater to any allergies or needs, and our friends proved it true!"}
{"text":"I had heard really great things about Tree Hugger's Cafe over the years.  I finally got a chance to stop in for lunch while visiting Cleveland for Thanksgiving.  Upon walking in, the only open table was a high-top right next to the door, and it got a little breezy during our meal.  The ambiance overall is a little lacking.

Both my friend and I went with the black cactus black bean burger upon the server's recommendation.  I normally need to be in the mood to have a veggie burger, but I figured if it was as good as I had heard, I could roll with it.  Our food came out pretty quickly, and the burger was huge.  It was flavorful, but I have had better black bean burgers elsewhere.  I did like that they served their burgers with sprouts.  I also had sweet potato fries on the side which were awesome!  The mustardy dipping sauce was great too.  My friend raved about their vegan peanut butter cookies and I will say they were excelelnt.

You can tell Tree Hugger's Cafe is a small family-owned place.  I'd like to go back to try something else and see if I like the food a little better."}
{"text":"To start,was the chef was clearly on vacation because it felt like I was chewing week old black bean paste that had zero flavor that the chef squished between his butt cheeks before work. .. if you order a black bean burger, know you will be getting ONLY beans, dry, stinky, nasty beans! They were so dry, they were white on the inside..repulsive! 

The pretzel bun was a sad story for the leftover bread they chose to throw on my fancy bean paste burger that was way over priced might I add.

Last time I checked the aioli that came on the burger was supposed to have basil in it, now what came one my burger was a white water sauce.   Now I'm getting worried...

Crunchy food service mushrooms are quite different than GMO FREE portables mushrooms. I get that you guys were short on produce but maybe you can order more? Or just don't lie. 

The chef needs to LEARN how to cook a proper egg, any sunny side up egg that is brown on the bottom is enough of a reason for you to get your 'chef' title taken. Get back to school because grandma was wrong when she told you, you could cook!

NOT GMO FREE. organic tomatoes and mushrooms are very different than the food service tomatoes mushrooms. There is a difference. Oh wait isn't that your selling point..? 

Then Our waiter thought that picking his nose the whole duration of our meal was the icing on the cake, or was it the crunchy mushrooms? Very dirty.
They call it tree huggers, I call it nose huggers!!

To end on a good note, SOME of the fries were crispy. I guess fries are all the chef can really handle making. 

It's sad that people cannot even cook vegetables."}
{"text":"I was very excited about trying the Treehugger's Cafe. The concept behind the business impresses me. They support local businesses, have numerous organic options, and many vegan items. 

They have free wi-fi and seat about 20 people inside. The interior is typical coffee shop and bulletin boards show they support the efforts of the local community. 

I started with the creme brulee coffee which was very tasty and our server came by many times to offer refills. 

I had the Butternut squash stuffed with portabella mushroom risotto finished with a nutmeg shallot sauce with a side of vegetarian French onion soup with vegan cheese for $16. The sauce was very bland and I used the spices on the table to add flavor too it which helped but something was still missing from it. Overall it was good but not as good as it could've been and I wouldn't order it again. There are many other things on the menu that I think I will try next time."}
{"text":"When I'm in the neighborhood and need something healthy, this is a good option. Not something I'd make a special trip for, however. On a recent visit, I had tuna-stuffed avocados, and my mom had a chicken salad wrap. We split the fried green tomatoes to start. My chief complaint is that everything was just under-seasoned. I could've used more lemon and dill in my tuna, for example. I was also put off by the fact that one of my avocado halves was way underripe, and that's something that's hard to miss when you're cutting it. Our experience ended well, though. I got adventurous and tried one of vegan molasses cookies (to me, the phrase \"vegan bakery\" just does not compute) to take with us. To my surprise, it was really good. As others have mentioned, prices are a little steep. I have no problem paying a premium for organic/locally sourced/humane food, but even I was not expecting our bill to be as large as it was."}
{"text":"We went for the first time today.  We ordered the grilled lemon paninni with the black bean salad and both kinds of fries.  Our food was fresh and full of flavor.  The bean salad was delicious with just the right amount of season.  The chicken was moist and flavorful with bright lemon and pesto. I dont usually like fries but these were yummy. 

We knew going in that everything is made fresh and to order. Therefore we knew that we would have a little bit of a wait. It was worth it believe me. Another bonus is the friendly staff and of course the vegan deserts. We will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"I dont consider myself an extremely \"healthy\" eater, but Tree Huggers is AMAZING! They have options from vegan, vegetarian, organic, all are delicious and will make you rethink what it means to eat healthy. The service is great, along with their daily specials. Make sure you join their texting list to get specials and discounts. My personal favorite is their cookies- they are amazing. One of my favorite spots in Berera,"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and it's been awesome both times.  The first time, it was summer, and I had a black bean burrito outside.  The service was fast and efficient, and it gave me a lot of good ideas for my kitchen at home.  

The second time was more recent, and a bit of a different experience.  It was dinner hours, and fairly packed.  A hostess seated me, and my dining partner showed up.  We waited about 15 minutes before she flagged down a server.  They were apologetic, and gave us free baked goods;  it wasn't an \"oh, we screwed up, here's some free token thing\" move either, they seemed legitimately upset that they'd missed us.  We split an order of the bruschetta;  my only complaint was that there was way more bruschetta than bread to eat it with.  Not too tremendous of a complaint, but one nonetheless.  I had a quinoa and sweet potato burger, and was pleasantly surprised.  When I left, I picked up an everything cookie, and it was amazing.  There was literally everything conceivable to put in a cookie in it.  

It's family owned, and they're very conscious of the food they serve.  I can't complain about the service, and the prices are fair.  Nothing exactly sets the world on fire with newness, but it's great for vegetarian/vegan comfort food."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious vegetarian/vegan menu items! I also got one of the everything oatmeal cookies-so good!"}
{"text":"This is always our dinner stop when coming home from the airport... Amazing staff excellent food and amazing cookies!!!"}
{"text":"Just found this place and wow.  Had to grab something quick but wanted something healthy.  The Black Bean and Sweet Potato Burrito was an excellent choice for this purpose.  It was very good, with a nice somewhat crispy wrapper and a small side of mango salsa.  Very nice presentation on the plate.  To drink I had some of the delicicous homemade Lemonade.  Staff was very friendly and service was fast.  I will stop again."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious Vegan and vegetarian eats.

Had to sneak over here for a break from the Omnivores.  Salads were delicious, and they were very nice about \"veganizing\" items.  Seaweed salad and bean salad were both delicious.

Brought back some scones to the unsuspecting family, who proceeded to gobble up and shake the bag for crumbs.  Such a hit,  forcing me to finally confess they came from Treehuggers.

They were amazed and did not notice a difference (much to their surprise).

Next time,  I think I will be brave and simply take them along to eat \"my\" food.

Con:
 - Seating is limited, so don't bring a school bus of friends
 - Wish there were more Engine2/Happy Herbivore type options But all in all, very happy to have any kind of vegan option available.


Pro
 - Food for everyone. No one would leave hungry or feeling deprived, this is vegetarian food, not spa cuisine.
 - Delicious treats you can enjoy and share with worrying too much about ingredients
 - Nice selection of Vegan and vegetarian options that don't feel \"Too healthy\" - and probably would be fine and dandy with omnis."}
{"text":"If I could, I would give Treehuggers 3.5 stars; it fills an important niche for vegetarian and vegan dining on the west side, the atmosphere and service are great, and I already want another of those huge vegan Everything cookies.  But I felt like some of the flavors were out of balance - while the Everything cookie and my husband's eggplant panini were great, my curried chicken wrap was bland(!) and the corn chowder was overwhelmed by rosemary.  You pay a premium, because they're using local and organic ingredients, so I wanted everything to be as tasty as possible, and it wasn't.  That said, I wouldn't hesitate to return to sample more from the menu - and I would recommend Treehuggers to any curious diners, even though I continually had to remind myself that the unfortunately named \"Harp Seal Scones\" do not contain even a smidgen of harp seal. B+"}
{"text":"Ok, to be fair: This is Ohio and the Treehugger café is the only place with vegan/ organic options for miles. But this has nothing to do with bad service. So rude!
The food was ok, but needs some more sauce.
Cookies and Coffee were good!"}
{"text":"I was so pumped to go here and see what it's all about. I try to live a gluten free life and it's nice to go somewhere that has an extensive selection. Also the Yelp deal they have is awesome. 20% off entrées...woo!

Unfortunately the service was mediocre. He forgot to ask my friend if she wanted something to drink 3 times before she had to get up and go ask for one. He just passed right over her when taking everyone order. He also forgot my order entirely. My burger was late getting to the table and to try to slip the incident past me, they undercooked the burger from making it too fast and it was still raw when it got to the table. I love rare as much as the next guy but this was RARE. Absolutely raw. I was already frustrated and hungry so I ate the outside of the burger where it was safe. This was more disappointing because what I had of it was delicious. I had the tree house burger and sweet potato fries. All of which was awesome....well what I could eat of it.

I would not be apposed to giving this establishment a second chance. I would definitely go with a smaller group and wait for my order to be perfect though before writing another review."}
{"text":"I'll preface this review by saying I really like what Tree Huggers is about and i also like that they use mostly local organic ingredients. 

The food here is good just not great I have found everything I have tried (with the exception of the sea turtle panini which is very tasty) just a bit lacking in flavor, the sides especially.  The bakery here has been average and I generally love vegan bakery.

The dining room is ok, my last visit though it was 90+ outside an they didn't have any AC on or fans blowing which made things a bit uncomfortable.  The staff has been friendly and the service has been pretty quick.

I really wish I could say more good things about this place but so far each of my experiences here have been mediocre."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat.  Great selection of burgers, wraps, and salads.  Love the varying specials that are offered day to day.  We always get excellent service and don't mind waiting a little longer for delicious meal.  The ginger peach tea is amazing!  Good variety of food for vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters."}
{"text":"More restaurants like this are sorely needed in the Cleveland area.  The food is wonderful -- and much of it is organic, fresh and local.  There are fresh baked goods, and if you're gluten free or vegan it's no problem!  There will be many choices for you, including the mostly-unheard-of-in-restaurants gluten-free bread! Yum!

The owner has really put her heart and soul into this place and it shows.  The staff are great, and the vibe is really friendly.  There was live music one time I went there as well.  

It's set back from the road, so you need to watch for it...next to PowerHouse (?) Gym, which is very visible from the road."}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch! Yes, it's expensive, but very good quality/healthy options. Could eat their kale salad every day. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but the prices are crazy! $15 for lunch? This is why people have a hard time eating healthy, way too expensive!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem!  Friendly down to earth service.  Bean dip is amazing with the pita chips.  The chicken sausage sandwich was amazing until I realized how full I was from the bean dip. If I ever have to travel to Cleveland again, I would go back!"}
{"text":"YUM!  Possibly the best salad I've ever eaten (and through a drive-through, near Cleveland?!?)  

Simple enough:  lettuce, goat cheese, grilled chicken, mandarin oranges, walnuts, etc. but with an AMAZING home-made cranberry dressing - everything is FRESH (the chicken is esp. good).  

I also got an everything cookie for dessert, really yummy.

Give yourself time if you go through the drive-thru.  

Also - kudos for the compostable take-out container and even plant-based utensils!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time this evening and I will definitely be going back. Had a delicious salad topped with pecan crusted chicken and split the sweet potato fries with my husband. The food tasted fresh and was made with high quality ingredients. My husband got a burger and he really enjoyed his meal also. We will absolutely be making a trip back and I would highly recommend this restaurant. Don't let the small size of the storefront and unassuming location fool you...it is worth giving it a try."}
{"text":"The food was good, but took a long time to be served. Approximately $95w/tip for 4 people to have lunch(basically soup and sandwiches) is way out of line in my book. If they cut their prices in half I'd consider going back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go after a good workout. Food is always fresh and delicious, and the coffee is my favorite around ( Pirates Brew is the best!). Their teas are so refreshing too! 

Today I ordered the tuna salad on avocado! So so so good. Packed with protein and no mayonnaise! Just dill. Love the tuna here!

Sweet potatoe fries are awesome...ooohhh and their soups! Unfortunately they ran put of their corn chowder today, which is one of the best soups I have ever had, but their tomato basil was good too and had chuncks of tomatos... was served with rosemary bread!

I have been here so many times and have never had a bad meal! 

The only reason I give it 4 stars is the service...a little slow...even on days that aren't busy.

If you go...make sure you get a vegan cookie!"}
{"text":"So we went to Tree Huggers a few weeks ago on the way to our general inspection for a house ..( that didn't go well) anyways.. we were very excited when we got there, good mood, loving life... 

The wait staff was super friendly and welcoming! 
They have so many gluten free options which is a HUGE plus for me.. the bakery items are on point!! Yum yum yum!!! 

Now it did take a while for our food to come out .. but even though it wasn't busy. That was a bit of a downer -- but won't stop me from going back. 

They did get my husbands burger wrong - he asked for different cheese and without a bun... came with bun and with the cheese he didn't want.. 

I got a gluten free chicken salad sandwich.. it was ehhh..probably won't get it again.. and their gluten free bread is WAY TOO dense and thick ... they need to use a different brand of bread for sure .. 

But I still loved the place and will be going back once we finally move out that way!"}
{"text":"Came for the first time to meet a colleague for coffee. As a non-coffee drinker, I ordered a chai tea latte. It was pretty good. The service was good too, but a bit difficult to navigate at first. Do I sit? Wait to be seated? Order at the counter? Menu looked pretty good, so I'll definitely be back to try it."}
{"text":"I've been to Treehugger's twice now, and I am totally in love with this place.  The food is just amazing.

The first time, I had the \"Toucan\" veggie-cheese panini and a bowl of soup -- don't remember its name, but it had beans & dark greens.  I eat gluten-free, and being able to eat a panini...I haven't done that in the five years I've been eating gluten-free.  The bread was crumbly, but the sandwich was so good I almost fell out of my seat.  Heaped with cheese and veggies -- heaped!  The soup was delicious too, though the gluten-free panini stole the show.

This last time I was at Treehugger's, I had the \"Black Cactus\" black-bean burger with sweet-potato fries.  When the server asked me how everything I was and I said, \"It's so amazing,\" I think she thought I was talking about the fries.  Yes, they are really good.  Crisp in that perfect way, served with spicy honey-mustard sauce.

But NO, I was talking about the burger.  Oh my gosh!  I had to force myself to put down the burger and eat some fries -- because I wanted eat them first so I could have that burger taste lingering on my tongue for the rest of my life.  Giant patty, all beans and veggies, no fillers, stacked with avocado, tomato, sprouts, lettuce, swiss cheese...nearly impossible to eat, so this place is not for the dainty, and I was glad I was facing away from all the other customers so I could smash my food into my mouth without worrying about what I looked like.

Yes, the prices are higher than what you'd expect at a standard cafe, but consider what you get!!  It's not just that it's organic, etc. -- it's the amount of food and the way they dish it up.  I don't know of anywhere else you can get food like that around here, and both meals I've had at Treehugger's were more exciting and satisfying than the recent meals I've had in the city or on the near west side -- my usual haunts, so this place is a jog, but I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Never disappointed! Always great food and great service, (we usually get Sam!)
Thank you, Treehuggers!"}
{"text":"Quintessential idea of a cafe. Cozy seating, unique food, truly a hidden treasure of Berea. The only downside of trying to find this place is that it is nestled quietly beside POWERHOUSE GYM (what?) almost overwhelming to see next door. Moving on, the menu is a cornucopia of food choices. Seriously, one of the most diverse menus I've come across. Raw vegan cookies, vegan corn chowder, buffalo mozzarella eggplant sandwich, the ground chicken burger; what's not to love about a place that caters to all eaters? I personally loved the coffee that came from a distributor up the street, after a rough night shift it really hit the spot. I actually meant to buy a bag and forgot, but will certainly not withhold a trip here to fulfill this desire as well as some delicious food. Sitting outside or inside is personal preference, and probably based on weather, seeing how Cleveland is so temperate...but the indoor seating is so laid back- choices range from cushy chairs to cafe tables and booths. Overall, I give this two thumbs up aside from the locating issue, which is user error anyway."}
{"text":"I'm not from Cleveland and this was my first time but if I didn't have a groupon for this place I'm sure I would have never found it.  It's located in a strip mall and in close proximity to a cemetery.  Once you walk inside, however, it's very cute and appetizing.  

They offer vegan, vegetarian, and carnivore food alike.  Started off with the bruschetta which was surprisingly amazing.  Probably one of the best I've had.  The menu boasts using only fresh, local, in-season ingredients and I could taste it!  I had a beef burger which was pretty good.  My girlfriend had the oats burger (vegan) but it was REALLY dry.  It'd be nice if they offered veganaise or some sort of dressing for the vegans to put on their burgers.  

I'd def come back if I lived in Cleveland but I'd want to come back for the breakfast.  I was practically drooling reading the menu.

One last note: the service was spot on!"}
{"text":"I'd like to support an unusual, local, vegetarian-friendly place. I give them points for that! But the portions were small, the prices were a bit high compared to similar places, and much of the food was tasteless. I liked one of my side dishes a lot (some unique cold salad), but it was tiny, and the rest of my meal I just kind of swallowed to fuel my body, like when they eat pills in sci-fi movies. My friend was similarly disappointed. We were left hungry, and although the desserts looked very good, there were flies inside the bakery case. So we passed on them.

It's the kind of place I want to see improve, and might give them a chance again. Fingers crossed! If not, then this is probably just not my kind of place. There's a school of thought that says healthy food should have minimal flavor. Some (not all) of the food here seemed to fit that mold."}
{"text":"Eh.  Ordered five items, and only two were good.

- Penguin Chicken Salad wrap: apparently this changes on the regular, so who knows, you might get lucky & have a delicious wrap.  Mine was not the best chicken salad and it was filled with olives--one of the few food items I don't care for.
- Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookie: Definitely extremely light on the chocolate, but this cookie is gigantic and it tastes a lot like a Chinese almond cookie
- Apple cider: this was gross.
- Sweet potato fries: Solid choice with a nice seasoning on top; these are also served with a really nice honey mustard.  The combo of honey mustard + sweet potato fries is a touch sweet for  my tastes, but it's still pretty good.
- Pumpkin soup: This wasn't the worst soup, but I think this has a lot to do with failing to meeting my expectations.  Since it was served alongside my wrap, I assumed it would be a salty/savory pumpkin soup... unfortunately, it was very sweet & heavy on the coconut milk. Just not a fan.

I want to give this place the benefit of the doubt and say that I sucked at ordering, but the service, while kind, was extremely slow.  They use Square as their POS, and I'm not sure if they're new to the system, but they definitely didn't know how to use it. The waitress was apparently busy, so I just brought myself to the counter to ask for the bill and It took the staff a good 10-15 minutes to charge my card and get me out the door."}
{"text":"Omnivores,vegans, pescetarians, vegetarians, lacto-ovo vegetarians, flexivores, carnivores and people who love soup--- they have you covered.

I'm not a vegetarian, but I do try to eat healthily.  That generally means, more veggies, less fat, less meat, more whole grains, more organic food...  Sadly, that often limits lunch choices to grilled chicken salads.

Tree Hugger's has lovely, lovely soup, great vegetarian and chicken (with fruit!) salads.  I recently had the black bean chimichanga-- black beans, rice and sweet potato in spices wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla and grilled.  It wasn't meat and it wasn't fried, yet it still managed to taste fantastic!  The chicken salad wrap is delish, but it really does need salt.  (I actually appreciate that, though, because most places over-salt everything.)

Fear not the vegan cookie!  Vegan baked goods are usually disgusting.  Sorry guys, but that brownish lump of oats, hemp seeds, coconut and carob is just not appealing.  Tree Huggers has somehow managed to make vegan cookies that are as desirable as plain old cookies!!!  I had a carrot ginger cookie-- think of a light carrot cake with an orange ginger glaze.  It was huge, crumbly, soft and delightfully flavorful.  And it looked like a cookie, not a clod of mud!

Don't wait until you are on some sort of health kick to eat here!"}
{"text":"I had heard much about this place from some vegan friends, and seeing that they did actually have meat on the menu, I decided to pay a visit. 

It's tucked away in the corner of a non-descript strip mall-ish building on Bagley Road, but the inside is a lot more funky than the outside would suggest.  It reminds me of the type of place that you would find in a college town, which I suppose Berea is, although Treehugger's isn't really adjacent to Baldwin-Wallace. 

Anyway, the menu seems relatively diverse, with a heavy lean towards vegetarian and vegan dishes.  This includes a vegan friendly pastry case with muffins, cupcakes, and brownies.  

I opted for a BBQ Chicken wrap and sweet potato fries, and overall I was pretty satisfied.  The prices are a bit higher than you might expect for similar food elsewhere, but assuming they are practicing what they preach about using local and organic ingredients, this would make sense. 

I agree with the Treehugger's mission statement, and it was executed well, but I didn't eat anything that made me want to return immediately.  That being said, I would be happy to go there again, and I will certainly recommend it to my green leaning friends."}
{"text":"I have eaten the Hell's Kitchen burger, the sweet potato fries, and some of their vegan cookies.  

All the food has been pretty good.  The prices do seem to be higher than average for the neighborhood ($14 burger, $6 basket of fries), but take advantage of the Yelp $20 for $10 deal and you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I went out here because of the vegan menu for my brother. His friend introduced us to the place. It is in a scenic area. I could imagine a giant hawk flying around the place when the sun is out. The vegan burger was good. I did not miss the meat at all. The hummus was good. It needed olive oil added. They provided the oil when the food was brought out. The waitress was a kind young woman who blushed at my jokes. That made me feel like my jokes were either really good, or in bad taste. What wasn't in bad taste was the food!"}
{"text":"Yikes. So I have been supporting tree huggers for awhile now. Love that it is an organic local restaurant. But oh my god they are going down hill. 

I called to get take out and no one answered the phone. So I went up there to order take out. 

I ordered the chicken salad wrap and it had maybe 4 pieces of shredded chicken on the entire wrap. Definitely had way more celery pieces than chicken...

On a positive note the sweet potato fries are really good. 

I dunno if it's worth the money. They need to revamp the place and the service."}
{"text":"In honor of the original long haired hippie in sandals, who preached peace and love; i went on a three part Free Range Easter Egg hunt of the west side. Stop one was Treehugger's. I've cruised up and down Bagley road countless times looking for it based on word of mouth. I finally looked up the actual address which resides some two miles west of campus in the middle of nowhere. That is probably my only complaint. Rent must be cheaper.

The menu was amazing. So many vegan options. I finally had choices beyond just the grilled cheese. I ended up getting a grilled cheese. So to speak. It was a grilled eggplant panini with buffalo mozzerella. Is that cheese like the hot shit now? Cause i see it everywhere. It also had a zippy basil pesto. The bread was not very thick or crisp, but most likely locally produced, so it gets passing marks. There were four burger options available. A burger would be too heavy at noon, hence cheese sandwich.

 The fries were kind of limp like the ones i make at home. The expertly light seasoning made them worth eating, though. I guess after a lifetime of eating fast food fries, i forgot what good food should actually taste like. i added a Queen Conch iced coffee that was a perfect pick me up on a sunny afternoon.

Total was around 14 clams. A buck or two steep, but considering the care they take in being so damn green and supporting other local businesses, i can live with it. The bakery also offers many vegan goodies. Now that i know where it is, i will def stop in any time i'm down in Berea."}
{"text":"Don't let the vegan selections scare you away carnivores. The menu has a wide selection of very fresh and interesting entrees (including fish and chicken dishes). I got the lemon basil chicken panini on the pretzel bun. Delicious. Not exactly adventurous though. I stole a bite of my son's crabbed stuffed avocados. Even better. Definitely will go back here."}
{"text":"I was visiting the area, and actually ate at this restaurant two days in a row!

I am vegetarian, so I thought this place would be a great place to check out.  On my first visit, I wasn't sure what to get, since there were so many tasty sounding options.  I opted for the black bean burger.  As far as black bean burgers go, I would say it was definitely above average, but not phenomenal.  I also had some cheesy fries as an appetizer/side, and boy were they yummy.  On my way out, I decided to grab a ginormous and delicious peanut butter brownie. I must admit my eyes were bigger than my stomach on this occasion, so I saved the brownie for later.  

The next day, I knew I needed to eat somewhere, and I also knew that there were lots of exciting things on their menu that I hadn't gotten to eat the night before, so I went back to try something new.  This time I went for the mushroom melt.  I thought it was better than the burger I'd had the night before.  

Overall, I thought this place was pretty good, and would recommend it to others in the area."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in my last three visits.  A few weeks back I got the beet smoothie and it was made completely wrong.  It had so much cocoa powder in it I couldn't drink it. I love their beet smoothie normally.  Yesterday I went to the one in Life Works and got the soup for lunch.  It tasted like it was old and very much over cooked.  Today I called the one in Berea at 11:25 and ordered a mushroom panini.  I work right down the street, they said 10 to 15 minutes.  I got there at 11:45.  Paid and was told it would just be a few minutes.  At 12:10 I was still waiting and asked for a refund.  They kept saying my food would be ready in a minute or two.  I no longer had time for lunch, they did finally give me my order.  I got it at 12:20. I did ask to be refunded.  I am sad....this use to be so good."}
{"text":"Has the best hummus and sweet potato fries around! Absolutely love this place. Great food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly staff. However, the restaurant doesn't have any faux meat/mock meat and staff don't even know what those phrases mean!

Half of the menu was not even vegetarian anyways. So not sure why it's considered a vegetarian restaurant. What the hell is \"humane meat\"? Options were pricey.

I tried the white rhino burger (supposedly popular). Very small burger and tasted bland. No spices or anything to go with it. Ehh $13.95 for that. I could have made 8 burgers, at home, with veggies and tasted 10x better. The price was probably for the \"organic\" ingredients, but I'd never pay for a tasteless burger.

A side of marinated beans was good. I like the sauce/seasoning. in it."}
{"text":"We have always looked forward to coming here and as a special treat for my daughter (a vegetarian) an son-in-law. What a disappointment. Way over-priced, and my daughter did NOT like her meal at all. The wrap was bland and unappetizing. They did nothing about it except offer her a cookie. The rest of our meals were just OK. We'll drive to Tommy's from now on."}
{"text":"Sweet potato fries with honey mustard! WHAT A HIT! We all had a little of each entree: breakfast burrito, salmon salad, caesar wrap & one other wrap. They have great options for sides as well, like soup, salad (a few varieties including kale, barley, carrot) and fruit. The service is wonderful and very attentive, also - check out their YELP DEAL RIGHT NOW! What a steal :)

Their lavender vanilla scones and buckeye brownies I hear are also incredible."}
{"text":"Only reason they get 4 and not 5 stars, I know this is stupid, but its b/c they don't serve alcohol. Everything else, including service is top notch.
The food concoctions and taste were way above the price and the unassuming decor.  So in other words. Great value for your dollar.
I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Could this place be any more amazing !  Great tea, awesome Paninis and great service ! The east side needs one of these for sure!  We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Everything a quaint, passionate healthy, family run, local food based restaurant should be.  Everything we've tried there has been fresh, original and healthy.  What a Berea gem!"}
{"text":"Quinoa burger and quiche are my favs here. Their soups are good too. Burger meat is always prepared to temperature and way juicy .Everything is always fresh, organic, and good for your soul! I love that most their food comes from their local family farm.  Service and customers are friendly also. The only food I did not care for is the carrot raisin salad, though."}
