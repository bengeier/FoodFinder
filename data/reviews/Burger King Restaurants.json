{"text":"ordered the new spicy chicken wings (3) for $5.75 got 3 shrivelled up ice cold fingers that were actually the size of my baby finger .The cook had poured approx. 4 ounces of Franks Red Hot sauce over them to at least make them warm. RIPOFF do not order these"}
{"text":"They ALWAYS forget to put some of my order in the bags at drive-thru. I'm sick and tired of it. Also food not cooked properly, got sick from it. Stay away from this location."}
{"text":"If I was rating this restaurant on food alone, I would give it about 2 stars. My $5 special for lunch today was nothing special. However, the exterior landscaping, the interior design, and the washrooms are much better than run of the mill fast food joints. I liked the decor even before it was renovated a few years ago. Obviously, the owner of this franchise location has put some profits back into the business and has some pride of ownership.

This might just be the nicest Burger King in Canada."}
{"text":"Service has gone down hill, have had my order messed up twice in this location.  1 star."}
{"text":"No services, manager an asshole and they close at 19:00 on Sunday even if it's written 21:00. They told me it was like this since a year. Just by the time a wrote this i seen 7 cars and 8 peoples get turn over"}
{"text":"Okay usually Don't do Fast food restaurants. but by chance i happened to go here twice. First thing its clean. One of the cleanest i have encountered. Staff is friendly and nice. They are fairly busy and from what i can tell they have a lot of regulars that staff knows by name now that is good service. If you want Junk food and happen to be in the area, Look towards this then Mcdonalds."}
{"text":"For a Burger King that's been in Brampton for a long time it's good to see this one so well designed as this one. 
 Came in as it was packed up with people but with amount of staff (which were friendly and super efficient) they cleared the line ups swiftly without any discrepancy. 
 By the way the washrooms here and fantastic for a fast food place and another note on decor, they have some historical type pictures of bramelea area including buildings."}
{"text":"What can I say?  It's Burger King. Most of the staff are friendly and the food is consistent. It would be nice if the people handling the food wore latex gloves but I guess you can't expect much for a fast food joint. It has a jungle-gym at this location so it can get kinda noisy if there's a lot of children there."}
{"text":"Service at this location is good but not as fast as at Queen and 410. Food is reasonably consistent though I did get a Whopper once that wasn't quite as hot as it should have been. Other visits have been better though."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Burger King locations. Drive-thru is super fast even when there are crazy long lines on the weekend. I loved it many years ago when I'd go through the drive-thru with my dog and they'd give her a doggie biscuit. They don't do that anymore though. Too bad."}
{"text":"Very poorly run Burger King...fast to take your order but a long wait with mass confusion to receive what you ordered. As well as having to go back to the counter to have your order corrected as they were unable to get the order correct.  The food was only like warm when we finally were able to sit and eat our orders. The drink machines, one was broken down and the other wasn't producing ice...

I firmly believe this restaurant suffered from poor management or untrained management as any person with common sense could fix 90 % of the service issues.  

I will not be returning to this location....

I do not believe that the issues I experienced are nothing more that this location being poorly run."}
{"text":"One of the cleanest burger king rest. Ever
The staff was very friendly, it was a bit crowded but they were able to help all customers in a accurate manner."}
{"text":"Only been here once. Went through the drive through. Since it is pretty standard fast food fare, I likely don't have to explain much about what to expect. 

Unfortunately, fast food appears to be a misnomer in this particular case. It took them at least 5 minutes to take our order in the drive through. When we pulled up, they said, \"One moment please,\" and they never came back. After about 5 minutes, we're like, \"Heeellooo?\" They again said, \"One moment please.\" About a minute later, she said, \"Okay, I will take your order now.\" When my husband asked for dipping sauce, she said she would take our order for that at the window pretty curtly.

Then we had to wait another 5 minutes for one car in front of us to get their food. There only appeared to be two people working there: the woman who was running the drive through and a kid taking orders in the front. Perhaps she was the one cooking the food, which is why she told us to hold on? In any event, if you're hungry or in a hurry, I cannot recommend eating here. If they are short-staffed, perhaps that happens, but it would be helpful if they told you it would be a little bit of time."}
{"text":"I usually never comment on restaurants, ... I usually browse others comments....however this Burger King is by far the best BK I've been to. It doesn't matter what time of day I go, the food and service is always top quality. My number one pet peeve is when fast food restaurants serve cold/old/ soggy food. I can honestly say that this drive thru always has the freshest burgers, fries and breakfasts items ."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to a Burger King while living in North America, that is a feat of culinary restraint.  Sometimes you need a \"Whopper\" of a burger or maybe you have a chicken sandwich craving or maybe you just want a cardboard \"BK crown\".  This is one of the places to do get it.  This BK is one of the newer concept restaurants.  Bright open spaces and sightlines, larger tables for families, cool trendy colors.  I particularly like BK over McD...my weakness is their \"chicken\" sandwich....if you can call it that.  A salty deep fried piece of protein that resembles chopped up chicken nuggets that is placed on a hogie type bun with mayo and lettuce.  Simple, salty and tasty.  I also like the poutine at BK, as it resembles a Quebec style rather that cheese  with a beef gravy on fries.  Quick bite...yes...Salty food....yes...Bk....yes...3 stars"}
{"text":"Pretty good BK.  All the normal items.  I've tried drive-thru twice and service has been friendly & efficient.  Burgers were good both times."}
{"text":"Rating off service. Amazing people work here who care. Food is typical BK, but service is excellent."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for two whopper jr's and two small fries. My total after tax was only $5.07. The staff on the intercom and at the window were very polite. My order came quickly and was hot. 

I was glad that they obliged my request, and had added extra pickles on the burgers. The part I was most impressed with was that they gave me 13 packs of ketchup! It was more than enough, and a very nice gesture. 

I quickly devoured the food as soon as I got home. It was pretty darn good. Would definitely go back if I am ever in a rush and have a hankering for fast food."}
{"text":"A number of years ago I got really severe food poisoning from a whopper I had here.  I was off work vomiting and with the runs for 3 days. I haven't been back and do not intend to go there."}
