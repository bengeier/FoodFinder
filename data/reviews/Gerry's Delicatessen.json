{"text":"We went there to have breakfast.  The place is quite big, there are two sections, one is better than the other because in the morning there's more sunshine and there are more booth.  But there's a rule that doesn't allow clients with a stroller sitting in the better section.  So we were kicked to the other darker section where we have to sit in chairs instead of booth.  

But actually when we got in, there were really not many clients.  I would say maybe 6 and there are plenty of seats.  I don't understand why we were not allowed to sit there. And the other section didn't have any clients except us. And the waitress didn't come to pour coffee for us at all, she was having her own breakfast in the corner.  I felt we were forgoten there.

My husband ordered omlete and I ordered eggs with pancake.

The omlete was cooked in a too high temperature and the pancake was made from instant powder.  And we even have to pay for the maple syrup to go with the pancake.  But there's even no sugar powder on the pancake.  

The food is ok but what annoys is the service and wired rules.  We won't go back again!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food at a painfully slow pace.  The wait staff were arguing in front of everyone whose table belong to whom.  Then, you never saw them again. I actually had my waitress stand over my shoulder to see what kind of tip I was leaving!  Worst experience I've had in Montreal."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this place for the past 5 years since my work location changed, my favorite dish is the smoked meat plate. I know the service can be 'slow' at times, but one must realise this place is VERY popular with the locals that take-out & delivery seems to be more successive than dining in.

 With so many places trying to win over loyalty for the best smoked meat, I personally place this as third in the line of choice behind Smoked Meat Pete's or Schwartz's.

I more often than not take-out on my journey to work, my usual order is the smoked meat plate which is best ordered medium-fat. The dish has the fries on the bottom layered with the juicy meat on top. The bonus of ordering out with this dish is by the time you arrive home or work or by the time it arrives from delivery to enjoy, the juices from the meat drip onto the fries enhancing their flavor....it may be just my thing but man it is yummy!!! Although probably not the best for your heart and arteries, just once in a while is plenty worth it!!

Of note, I do believe parking in the area is free on Sundays which would be a good bonus."}
{"text":"Un ancien restaurant delicatessen du quartier servant des smoke meat et de la bonne bouffe grasse ! J'aime bien la pizza et le spaghetti gratiné ! Les plus anciens du quartier dirons que c'était meilleur alors qu'il était sur la rue Sainte-Catherine mais bon, moi j'ai pas connu !"}
{"text":"Pour une bonne pizza ou une poutine.
La place pour un fast-food de qualité!
Take-out toujours une bonne idée"}
{"text":"Un bonne place pour dépanner dans Homa nous avons essayé la livraison et nous avons aussi mangé sur place et les plats sont toujours très bons. Je ne suis pas un gros fan de leurs frites, mais leur viandes fumés est incroyable. Le restaurant semble très populaire pour les déjeuner aussi, mais nous ne l'avons pas essayé encore."}
{"text":"Un très bon diner de quartier. Menu très vaste, avec des choix allant de la poutine aux mets chinois. C'est pas cher, ça remplit et le personnel est sympa, exactement ce que l'on souhaite de ce genre d'établissement."}
{"text":"Gerry's Deli, decent diner with plenty of options for breakfast lunch and dinner. I had the souvlaki plate and was pretty satisfied. My son's chicken fingers came a little burnt and when we pointed it out the server immediately got them changed. More of a comfort food kind of spot and handy for when you feel like taking it easy. I came here in 2002/03 with some buddies and at the time Gerry's served rickard's red in frozen frosted beer mugs... ice in yer beer! Was awesome then :) I wonder if they still do that now. Gerry's - going strong since 1963  Wow"}
{"text":"Overall :
Beyond underwhelmed.  I cannot imagine a circumstance where I would eat here again or recommend it to someone else.

Food : 
Not bad, just pretty bland.  My partner had a corned beef sandwich that was the \"small\" but was heaped with an insane amount of corned beef.  The corned beef wasn't bad, but the bread was basically useless - fries and cole slaw were meh.  I had a cheeseburger, did not come with the lettuce and pickle I asked for, but it DID come with an unbelievable amount of mayo that I didn't.  Normally wouldn't be a complaint, but it wasn't written anywhere on the menu and I forgot that this is something that happens.

Decor / Atmosphere
Traditional diner decor.  Nothing good, nothing bad.

Service
Unbelievably slow.  Server was friendly, but in the middle of our meal he got caught up doing something in the kitchen and we couldn't get a check to save our lives."}
{"text":"Excellent delivery place. There's something in the menu for all tastes and the food comes hot and fresh (even the fries stay crispy!). Our favourites are the smoked meat, souvlaki and subs. Never been disappointed thus far and we order from there about once a week! I find the prices fair for the generous portions you receive. Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"A typical diner that offers a lot of options.

The chicken noodle soup had a lot of flavor.  The beef sandwich is a Montreal speciality and was highly recommended. It was rather good. Their small size is really large. The Tiramisu was just ok.

We went here for a quick meal but the service was slow. Priced on the higher side for a diner."}
{"text":"Restaurant qui sert de tout du genre autant des plats mexicains que des mets italiens et même chinois ! J'aime beaucoup leur sous-marins et leur gyros ! De plus, lorsque tu commandes, la livraison est vite vite vite! 

Belle place pour combler nos envies de bouffe grasse à bas prix avec toujours un très bon service!"}
{"text":"Very slow service, average food and overpriced. Our nachos with just melted cheese came 15 min after our main dishes. Enough said."}
{"text":"On sait à quoi s'attendre! Parfait lorsqu'on veut quelque chose de simple. Le service est amical et les prix sont raisonnables. J'ai mangé un smoked meat sandwich qui était très correct. Autrement dit: il y a mieux, il y a pire!"}
{"text":"So it's a fast food restaurant where you'll eat fast food. So that being said it's not a bad place to go to when you want to eat breakfast at a reasonable price. The food is what you pay for: fair and honest. The service is quick and good. When I feel like bacon and eggs I go to this place."}
{"text":"10$ breakfast not a bad deal had 2 eggs sausage French toast some pretty good tasting potatoes a little bit of fruit which actually tasted fresh.  Service a bit slow but over all good . My dad had some smoke meat with his eggs that I tried which was excellent.  Decor needs an update they been around for 54 years and at this location for 15 . Men's bathroom needs a better cleaning Im not allowed in the women's .  Worth coming here for a cheap meal with decent taste try the smoke meat!"}
