{"text":"Went there today because i heard they had good lunch specials. I order a chicken sandwich, because i only had about 45 minutes to eat and return to work. sat down at about noon, ordered, got ignored the whole time, and didnt get my food till 12:50. Which i politely mentioned when i arrived i was in a rush, AND my sandwich wasnt a sandwich, it was a wrap. the cook came out and asked if i wanted some chipotle ranch sauce, i said well sure because i didnt get my mayo.... i stood and stared at him for five minutes while the \"cute\" (old lady in a 20 year old's dress) bartender walked around with my debit card talking to more customers as i stood at the bar with my bag and food in hand, tapping my foot. NEVER going back."}
{"text":"I have not been to this place in a long time.  When I walked in the other night I knew something was wrong.  Half the bar was closed. There were only 3 specials listed.  The menu had been chopped in half, no friendly prices 21$ for a slab of ribs and no wing night.  There was only one barkeep on a Saturday night, and no one was eating.  I asked the bartender what happened. She advised me that the owner had moved and was trying to sell the place.    Wow, I was like this used to be one of my favorite places, and now it is going to crap.  Well one can only hope someone rescues this place but most of the bars are going to pot on Mayfield Rd.   May we have a moment of silence please."}
{"text":"It looks like Jeff B. has a follower....ha....2nd place in a row I followed right behind him with a review of a place in S. Euclid.  Once again Jeff's review is pretty spot on...Diva....I'm thinking you are talking about the tall blonde with the low cut shirts?  Just to add to the previous review, I have tried the wings and they CAN tame them down for you but they are not just regular fried wings.  I believe, cannot confirm, they grill their wings out of the fryer to give them the char taste along with the sauce of your choice.  Probably one of my favorite places for wings......that says A LOT.    2nd favorite thing to get there is their mussels.  Who would have ever put jalapenos inside the broth???  Trust me these too are delicious.  Again, if you don't see what you want on the menu, check out the chalk boards.  Specials galore!!  Sandwiches are really good but it seems like they thrive on those down home cooking specials that they offer occasionally.  I'm mad I missed their pig roast, next year for sure.  They also do live trivia but I can't tell you what day its on...sorry.  They have two nice cozy areas with couches if you want to hang as a group.  The only thing that keeps me from going there more often is the cops, they are terrible around that area.  Go with the big bowl of beer and have yourself some mussels and wings!!  Better yet, bring the boyfriend / husband and he'd be proud of you for knowing such a divish bar with such good man-food."}
{"text":"By far the worst bar service anywhere ever.  I've been here frequently for trivia, sometimes it's busy, so a little wait is expected, but even on busy nights, the bartenders spend more time socializing with each other, with customers already served, and sometimes with other bartenders who aren't working, but drinking. Last time, it was not very crowded, at all, maybe half the people that are normally there. Was the service more prompt? ABSOLUTELY NOT. This was even more frustrating, because the lack of attention was even more obvious. Their food is good, and the kitchen staff works quickly and brings it to your table. If the older blonde lady is behind the bar when you walk in, you might as well turn around and leave, unless you want an 80/20 split of your standing around waiting and drinking time."}
