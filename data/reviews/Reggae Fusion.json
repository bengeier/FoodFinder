{"text":"Being Irish/ Jamaican is really helpful because when i go to carribbean  restaurants they dont think of me. so its interesting to see how they react to me not realizing i can understand them. 

Here food flavour is good, but the menu is limited and even though the cashier writes the order on the take out container the cook still gets the order wrong 7/10 times. 

The BBQ chicken is nice and juicey. the sauce is really good even with the rice. I dont like coleslaw but my friend who tried said it didnt have much flavour. I asked for no gravy because they make it extremely spicy and they still covered my food in it. so i couldnt eat moat of it.

If you go and ask for steam veggies know from now the \"steamed veggies\" is just warm coleslaw....exactly warm coleslaw.

My friend ordered the medium Oxtail with rice they give 6 small pieces and most of the container is rice and coleslaw. 

compaired to order carribbean food places I've gone its still better than most and thats really sad. This was my third time coming here and i dont think i will be going back. If you like spicy food than you will like this place."}
{"text":"Super nice staff, good prices, but most importantly, delicious food! Had the jerk chicken, rice/peas, and coleslaw. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and customer service. This is the real deal. Curried chicken is made fresh as is everything. Oxtail is best in Toronto. Jerk is well cooked with just the right spice. Nice and juicy and tender. Patties are delish and the music is real authentic Jamaican."}
{"text":"Very friendly and accommodating staff. Typical Caribbean/Jamaican food. I had the Oxtail with rice and peas and also the Callaloo with salt fish and dumpling. Both were delicious. I will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"I have been passing this place for the last few months and decided to try it out today. Ordered a jerk chicken with rice and peas. Right away I noticed how extremely salty the chicken was and how the rice and peas was so bland. That is when I stuck a piece of wire in my mouth with my food. Unbelievable first and LAST experience. You should be quite ashamed to serve food like this with metal debris. Thank god I didn't swallow it or I most likely would be in the hospital right now. Didn't want a refund or replacement....I just never want to see this place again."}
{"text":"AMENDED VERSION: I wrote a bad review for Raggae Fusion months ago because it was closed on a Sunday, when the Yelp app said it would be open. Since then I have decided to give RF another go......and boy am I glad I did. 

I tried their oxtail, as I feel if your oxtail is good then anything else can be as well. The oxtail was DELICIOUS! The following week I tried the Jerk chicken.....twice! Amazing! I will certainly be frequenting Raggae Fusion for the foreseeable future. Glad I live close by."}
{"text":"Not bad. Good lunch time special $5.99

I got the jerk chicken lunch special. The chicken was tender and flavorful not to spicy. The coleslaw was nice and creamy but the rice and peas didn't have much flavour surprisingly.

I called ahead so I would not have to wait. Lady on the phone was very friendly. The lady behind the the counter when I got there however she was not to happy I think she was the daughter probably forced to be there lol"}
{"text":"I tried this place after driving by it so many times stopped in for some jerk chicken rice and peas , place looked clean well organized and some nice fish tanks on display ,however was disappointed with the poor customer service ,very laid back unprofessional person behind counter ,food was presented well but having eaten at at least a dozen caribean places the jerk was probably the top 3 worst I have had ,lacked flavor and not typical for caribean jerk chicken very small portion of rice but must say Cole slaw was fabulous , probably won't spend $14 dollars for this dish again"}
{"text":"Great jerk chicken and great oxtail. Would return and get the same thing."}
{"text":"I would strongly recommend everyone if you really want fresh juicy spicy jerk chicken please go there in the afternoon. It is family owned small restaurant on the corner of matheson and britannia and on this location i never tried yet. I would certainly post the pictures of the food but later."}
{"text":"Today was the worst food they could serve. The customer service representative told me they are out of chicken today. No problem i have ordered curry goat riceandpea and coleslaw. Wow i was expecting at lunch time 0240 pm they will be serving fresh but how unfortunate it was cold and looks like they dont want to serve more customers. I think the management should keep their standards good  and i know their food is always fresh but this time was smelly. The Rice were served cold."}
{"text":"Nice decor/atmosphere, fresh tasting food and reasonably priced, I've been here 2 times since they opened under the new management. So far food and service have been good and the place is looking nice. Will continue to go back hopefully nothing changes..."}
{"text":"Great food! Their jerk chicken is on point. And on Fridays they have fry chicken that is also very delicious. And the staff is friendly and welcoming! 
A nice change from what this place used to be"}
{"text":"Attended this restaurant about three 3-weeks ago for breakfast and tried the ackee and salt fish w/food and a dumpling. Man this was a great and I really enjoyed it! I also attended today (Apr 3) and had a large jerk chicken dinner w/oxtail gravy, spot on with the jerk seasoning and cooking and the rice and peas was just right. The portions are a little smaller than some of the neighbouring caribbean restaurant, but I think I am hooked on this place, for now. Give it a try and be your own critic. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was suppose to go to another restaurant because I was feeling for some jerk chicken but that particular restaurant was closed that day.  So what did I do? I whipped out my phone and yelped the nearest Carribean food joint and it led me to this restaurant.  When I walked in, the place was completely dead.  I placed my order for jerk chicken and waited.  I think the service that the girl behind the counter gives based on what other reviewers rant about is pretty accurate.  She never made eye contact with me nor did I get the friendly vibe from her.  But anyway, once I got my food I was out the door.

Overall, the jerk chicken was pretty good but it was a tad salty.  I did asked for extra gravy but I've had extra gravy at other places and it was never this salty.  I will probably go there again if I'm ever in a pinch but most likely won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Try their Signature pizzas. This used to be under the name of Twice the deal pizza. Same taste same products."}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars and not 5 only Because the previous restaurant that was here was a 5 star and I can't help but compare the 2. What would make this place 5 star is if they improved on customer service. 

The food is amazing that deserves 5 stars hands down. I'm so glad they did quality didn't downgrade when the businesses transferred over. I literally come here once a week I'm obsessed their chef must be AMAZING!! 

The customer service is a hit and miss. Sometimes the girls working are nice but there is particularly one girl at the front that has a weird attitude and just either hates her job or hates me I'm not sure. The male staff is amazing and the manager (I think he's the manager) is super nice. 

The prices went up from before but the place also looks a lot better so that's probably why they had to compensate which I understand. Either way this place is better than most jerk places in all of mississauga and I would recommend it to others and I'm a regular there."}
