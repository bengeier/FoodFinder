{"text":"$47.89 + tip for 3 people at brunch. 2 coffee 1 Pepsi. Tater tots in a chafing dish, dried hard waffle segments in chafing dish next to thin stuck together greasy bacon. Horrible bloated microwave type sausage links. Fruit flies on the fruit in October. No toast, no bagels only ripped apart dinner rolls. Rolled paper napkin with just knife and fork..I used the knife to stir my coffee.  Its as if  they make all the food at the beginning of the shift to load up the chafing dishes and then they all stand behind a counter and stare at the 10-15 diners. On our way out I showed most of what I've written here to a worker. He said he can't do anything about it. I suggested he say to the \"new management\" we can do better.  Roadside hotels have DIY waffles , bring the person cooking the omelets out of the kitchen and into the dining room to cook them, buy better bacon, put a toaster and a variety of bread in a basket with a clean liner on a table. Provide some butter/margarine. Don't overload the buffet table at 10 am so folks at 12 noon are afraid to eat the room temperature shrimp tortellini lest they spend the remainder of the day on the toilet. 

Someone in a censored/hidden post mentioned that their server disappeared ours did too. She never placed the order for an omelet. People arrived later and got omelets from another server but ours was prepared after we asked that woman what happened to our server and the omelet. Another waitress ordered the omelet and packaged it to go and tho our server reappeared she never came back to our table. P.S. Dogs loved the omelet. Thanks"}

They were professional,  courteous, attentive and the best.  The facility was clean and.the food was Awesome! !!! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"wonderful Location--had a luncheon for a group of 23---service quite good--food prepared at another location. Good company did not approach the food with any critical view. food was satisfactory but not really good. A good place to visit because of  the location."}
{"text":"I was with a group of 18 who stopped here for lunch after a Black Rivet boat trip. I had house \"Rose Cafe\" salad with chicken and found it very tasty. Others had various salads and sandwiches. Everyone enjoyed the food and we found the service prompt, attentive, and fast. Hard to believe that this is the place reviewed by others. I do agree on the wonderful view of the lake"}
{"text":"We were visiting some friends in the Lorain, OH area and we wanted to try a new establishment so we went to the Rose Cafe at Lakeview Beach. I had the Cafe Cheese Burger - $5.99. The beef was so ground-up that it was more of a paste than hamburger. A great idea for a patron with no teeth. My friend had the Roast Beef with Cheddar - $6.29; well actually it was Cheese Whiz and dried beef with the beef being more akin to unflavored beef jerky. All condiments are in squeeze packets; and the staff service is spotty at best - we had to ask for coffee refills at least twice in order to get it. My advice - go for the view only!"}
{"text":"Loved sitting on the patio overlooking the beach, unfortunately that was the high point , beer selection was extremely limited, and not very cold. Food was pedestrian simplistic, little flavor, with poor quality ingredients. Sandwiches were poor quality, with virtually no taste or flavor, McDonalds would have scored better. Fries were frozen and overcooked even my grandchildren were disappointed. Great Location just needs a quality kitchen and staff to make it shine."}
{"text":"I had my wedding reception here in June 2013. The inside was pretty I loved the patio in the back and the huge windows. Dealing with DeLucas sometimes got a little difficult, there were several things that I discussed with them beforehand that they didn't do as they said they would. For one I couldn't get into the place to see it for weeks after I paid my deposit because nobody called me back to set up a time to let me in, and the day we finally decided on, I was no showed. Also, other details like serving drinks in plastic cups which looked tacky, when I was specifically shown martini glasses when I asked for glassware. And they give you no choice of food when you schedule a tasting (isn't that the point?).. So the food we served guests was never tasted before the day and that was another thing not done exactly the way we asked, and not very good.. Those are just a few of the problems we had but the night of, the servers were all very nice and did their job well. I talked mostly with Rachel during planning and she is nice, I just wished management would have been a little more organized and did things the way they said and they would have gotten a better score from me. My advice is just to stay on top of things to have your day turn out how you want."}
{"text":"Since we are thinking of moving to the area, we thought we would check out this place due to its fabulous location.   With views of Lake Erie, you can't find a better spot in Lorain.

Service was great as we sat out on the beautiful terrace.

We both ordered the buffalo chicken wrap with the homemade chips.  This sandwich was big enough that we should have shared.  The first half (oddly for both of us) was super spicy and loaded to the gills with chicken.  The second half was so much better, as the saucy wasn't oozing everywhere and there was less chicken, so you could taste some of the other ingredients.   The homemade chips weren't served hot, which was disappointing.   They were also much thicker than most homemade chips.

The menu looked really nice, with numerous choices and decent prices.   

Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Two stars, one for the view and the other for the service. Servers were friendly and attentive. Food was barely edible. View and atmosphere is fantastic. Waste of a space and liquor license in what could be amazing."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great view of Lake Erie then this is the place to go. If you are looking for good cuisine you are better of spending your money elsewhere. The Rose Cafe' is catered by DeLuca's Place in the Park. Deluca's is a local venue where wedding receptions and parties are held. The food at the Rose Cafe' tastes like cheap wedding food. 

I would give the Rose Cafe' a try if you are just looking for a cute place to eat at along the lake. Their prices are decent and they serve sandwiches, salads, soups and basic diner-type dinners. They also offer a brunch. I'm not saying that their food is awful, but I would never come to the Rose' Cafe just because of the food. It's pretty bland and nothing special

Everyone who knows me know that I love to promote anything that has to do with Lorain so it pains me to knock anything in this city. I am willing to give The Rose Cafe another chance because I really do want to like it."}
