{"text":"Best Indian food in NE OH, hands down!!!
Absolutely delicious food, great friendly service,warm and hospitable atmosphere  - what else can you ask for?  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food at a great price.  Bring your appetite because the portions are plentiful.  Try the lamb korma and follow it up with gulab jamun.  This is the only restaurant that I have been to serve 3 pieces of gulab jamun.  That alone is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"food was excellent, but way overpriced at $24.00. ordered tandoori mixed grille.  received 2 shrimp, 4/5 lamb kabob,2 small pieces of chicken tikka(leg and thigh) and chicken tandoori(5/7 small) and various vegetables(onions,peppers.broccoli).  but the true insult was being charged an additional $3.00 for an order of papadum after receiving a compementary order when i arrived, and not being informed of the charge until i received the bill.           m"}
{"text":"The atmosphere left a lot to be desired. Had a Chinese take-out vibe. The appetizers and desserts were just okay. The price was a little steep... That being said our entrees and naan were so outstanding, it made up for any other short comings. The flavors were complex and fresh everything was served hot and it was served quickly. Mild food was mild, spicy food was spicy. We will definitely save up our dining-out budget to visit here again."}
{"text":"Hated it!! Can't believe they have more than 4 stars. We went for lunch ~12pm & were there for about an hour & we were the only ones!! That should tell the story!! Very few items in buffet for the price. Food was stale & also didn't looked fresh. 
Either reviews are fake or the quality is diminished significantly!!"}
{"text":"The food was good but WAY overpriced!!!! This is more expensive that New York and California prices."}
{"text":"We have tried several Indian restaurants in the Cleveland area and our experience was very good and we plan on returning. 

The staff was very attentive and genuinely interested in providing a quality dining experience. 

I personally will ask for a spicier version of the cuisine based on my personal preference. 

Would recommend visiting the restaurant."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian buffet I've been to in Cleveland, and I've tried quite a few. I've never had a bad dish here, and the service is so friendly and attentive. The goat korma and goat curry were the stars of the buffet when they were available, but even if neither are here you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Got the Vegetable Korma as well as the Red Curry Chicken and an order of the Garlic Naan.  Both were phenomenal!  This was the second time here and again it was five stars.

The food was fresh and just the right amount of spice for the Red Curry.  Will defiantly keep this place on the rotation."}
{"text":"My sister, mom and I shared the vegetable biryani and a selected of naan stuffed with cheeses, peppers and other savories. It was simply delicious. Steaming hot, perfectly seasoned and huge portions. 

The owner noticed it was my birthday (I opened 2 cards after we ordered) and be brought a tiny pistachio ice cream with a candle -- and played happy birthday thru the sound system! Fun!"}
{"text":"This place is a breath of fresh air in our neighborhood!  Great Indian dishes and an awesome lunch buffet!  

Do yourself a favor and try this place out!"}
{"text":"I have stopped in this new restaurant twice now.  Both of my visits have been on my lunch break and have gotten the buffet to go on both occasions.  The atmosphere is nice, cultural music playing, tables are  neatly set.  The person who I assume to be an owner or manager is very friendly.  The food is really delicious, I have had a variety of items from the Buffett.  I am overall pleased with both of my experiences."}
{"text":"I've been here many times but during the last 2 times the food was not good. Something changed. Tomato soup was tasteless, chickpeas in vegetable dish were under cooked and the lamb was cut in big pieces and not tender. Overall very disappointing."}
{"text":"Really neat place, with interesting and fun foods. Only negative is the super high prices for what you get. The buffet is small with a huge price tag. 

They have the reputation around town already, for high prices. Fix that and we'll go back."}
{"text":"I was really excited to find something difference out here in Geauga county. Pari is a small quant restaurant that has an amazing authentic aroma right as you enter. Our waitress was extremely helpful with suggestions and all of the food was really excellent. We had a tandoori sampler with chicken, beef and shrimp. You can order it mild medium, hot, or extremely hot.  The Naan bread was amazing. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Very over priced. They did not have many options. The food was not good.  I got the buffet and it stunk the kids meal had nothing to do with the India theme. Definitely not coming again!"}
{"text":"must try! you will be hooked to the spices and flavor of india.  the best indian food available in town. great service is a plus."}
{"text":"Wow. Best Indian food I've had in SO long, and the service was lovely. It's tucked away in a strip mall I usually ignore after living here for many years, but the interior is fresh and welcoming. If you're new to Indian cuisine, or like a little of everything, start with the weekend lunch buffet. It had all the standards - vindaloo, chicken tikka masala, mator paneer, naan, veggie pakora, and even some dessert to try. Literally everything I tasted was good! And at $14, it was an excellent deal - I ate until I was stuffed but felt great because it was mostly veggies and rice. I will definitely be back. So awesome that there's a new place in Chesterland serving something besides bar food. A must try for locals looking for a new addition to a night out, and totally worth the drive for anyone who lives farther out. Head and shoulders above any of the other local Indian places!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to all the good things said in previous reviews. The food is amazing and the service is very nice as well.  I strongly recommend the vegetarian platter appetizer and the chicken tikka masala along with the Fried okra entr√©e.  We had all of these and they were all amazing. One cool thing they have is the magic door which goes directly into the convenient store next-door so you can buy beer or wine for your dining pleasure. My wife is English and we have tried several Indian restaurants across many states in America but this is the first one that she found to be excellent.  We will be going back soon.  I would say the one odd thing this restaurant has is the choice of music. When we came in there was some interesting Indian music being played then silence for about five minutes then they switched to something more of a polka channel and then something more often found in an Italian restaurant. I would recommend they stick with some soft traditional Indian and they will be good to go. We dined on a Friday night around 6:45 PM and the restaurant was about half full.  They have a lunch buffet during the week and on the weekends which looks interesting and we plan to try that next so we can have a little more variety. Try the green chili sauce with the complementary crackers it is just a bit spicy and absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"We have only tried the buffet a few times, but have been pleased.  Not a lot of selections, but tasty and seasoned well.....nothing too hot or too spicy.  The price is very reasonable and i would recommend this place."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our chicken tikka masala. The lamb samosas were so crispy and delicious and naan was fresh and hot. 

Decided to carry out tonight.   Food was packed well, everything cooked perfect and was still hot when we got home.  

The menu is huge-so much to choose from.   We will be back."}
{"text":"I always feel satisfied after eating here! I haven't had the lunch buffet until today but I would highly recommend. They have the most delicious spread of dishes & warm naan bread was served to my table. Oh, and the service is the best too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!!!  My boyfriend and I are both foodies, and love trying out new restaurants in Manhattan where I live.  But we also like trying new places in Cleveland where he lives.  This past week we went back to Pari twice in a row - it was that good!
Service, excellent.  Noise level, beautifully low.  We could hear each other talk.  Food, amazing.  Garlic Naan and Chicken Saag to die for.
We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service! Some of the best Indian food I've had!!!! We had the lunch buffet on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Great Indian food, so pleased to find this place on our side of town. We have has their food twice and been pleased both times! Next time we need to come for the buffet!"}
{"text":"I have had Indian food around the country and grown to really love the cuisine. I was so excited to find out the old Guido's location was going to become an Indian restaurant, adding much-needed diversity to food choices in town. Whenever I return to Chesterland, I make a point of visiting Pari.

The food is very reasonably-priced (though maybe a bit expensive for Chesterland given other options in town), and the portion size is good. I have tried the Korma, Rogan Josh, Balti Lamb, Biryanis and a few appetizers. All have been tasty and well-prepared. The naan are generally fresh and offer a better deal than a lot of other places.The service staff are helpful and enthusiastic, even when shorthanded.  I highly recommend this place, and I bet take-out is good as well."}
{"text":"There are few times in my ten years living in the Cleveland area that I ate and ate til stuffed...Pari is one of those places. 

The restaurant is on the smaller to mid size but the booths are so comfortable and welcoming - white table cloths and attentive wait staff. 

We had the buffet (delicious) and a steal on the weekday price of $10.95.  Pakora - fresh, crispy and flavorful.  Samosas - packed with flavor, not soggy and delicious crispy shell.  The rice fragrant and light complimented the daily chicken selection (mango chicken) and the Naan and paneer chunks were delicious.  The salad, pickle assortment, gulab jamin and kheer accoutrement made for the perfect small sweet end to a wonderful meal. 

We wanted to try the chicken makhani so we ordered that as well - huge pieces of white meat chicken and that sauce I would be able to eat off ANYTHING and not care - I would love it as a soup too! Anyhoo that came home with me and half of it was today's lunch with the other half being tomorrow's (yes big enough to split!).  Also if you are new to Indian cuisine it was not overly or strong spiced - while unusually love spicy - current pregnant I go sparingly into that realm. 

I will make my way back many times - and def soon to try the weekend buffet which one of the two wonderful waiters we had said has even more selections & still from 11-3."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food, very fresh, authentic.  Food quality is on-par with better ethnic in  larger cities - Chicago, NYC.  Better food than a few other established Indian restaurants in Cleveland have had over the past few years.
Price seems a bit high for Chesterland...  but best deal is the weekday buffet, or weekend lunch buffet.  Buffet also includes warm Masala Tea - think Chai, but not so sweet. 

Been here a few times - hot food on the buffet is good & hot, never seems like it's been sitting too long. Good variety that has been different each time I've been there.  
The cold food is.... eh... they should probably invest in a cold buffet server to keep the items cold & fresher... but the kheer (rice pudding) is yummy!  
This place & My Thai are my 2 favorite places to eat in Chester!  (Chesterland is becoming quite the foodie haven!)"}
{"text":"We've lived all across the USA and love eating authentic cuisine.  Imagine our delight when a friend recommended Pari in NE Ohio! The chicken mango and the goat biryani were a delight to the palate. The service was also excellent."}
{"text":"Not sure about any thing about the food
It is very small portions.rice is plentiful
Chicken peices are very small like midget chickens..flat bread is good cant ruin that
We had another dish which was blah.cant share what it was bunch of nothing
Place was empty
Very boring kind of bizzare"}
{"text":"We had a pretty cool meal here on a Friday night. We had a reservation, and when we arrived, the table was ready to go. The people who own this place are gracious and welcoming. The restaurant is clean and cozy. It got pretty busy on Friday night, so if you head out on a weekend evening, it would be wise to make reservations. 
I had a Taj Mahal Lager. It was really good. Never had Indian beer before, and I'm glad I tried it. The naan here is so good. You can get it several different ways. I like it with butter. Order the Chicken Tikki Masala. You won't be sorry. It is scrumptious. So cool to be able to get authentic Indian food in little old Chesterland! We will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian restaurant. Sunday lunch buffet was delicious. My wife especially liked the Bhindi Masala. I liked the Chicken Tikka Masala. Their rice is very very good. We have been there before for the weekday buffet and can now recommend the weekend version."}
{"text":"A lucky find while traveling in Ohio visiting the nearby LDS church history sites.  This restaurant opened in Fall 2015, serves reasonably authentic and very delicious northern Indian food.  My wife loves her chicken tikka masala and it didn't disappoint, Vegetable Samosas excellent, theIr steamy heat tamed by the yogurt dill sauce.  Tandoori Lamb was sizzlingly good, a vegetable mixed curry type dish uniquely spiced, and the creamy white shrimp and cashew appetizer a velvety delight.  Recommend highly if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation of a friend. The food was delicious and well worth the drive. We came for lunch and the service was fast. We opted to order from the menu, instead of the buffet. Our party of for tried: vegetable samosas, vegetable pakora, chicken vindaloo, lamb vindaloo, paneer tikka masala, chicken tikka masala, and a variety of naan. We also had mango lahssi. The total was $103 plus tip, so more than the usual for a lunch. The portions were generous, so we will be getting a second meal.  We will return. The only downside was that the restaurant was too warm."}
{"text":"I don't understand so many positive reviews for this extremely expensive restaurant.  The chicken in the vindaloo was so dry it was a chore to swallow.  The lamb in the khadai was like rubber.  The biryani was the blandest single Indian dish I've ever had.  No butter chicken on the menu?  Strange.   The chili pakoras were like two day old jalape√±o poppers.  Really disappointed in this place.  Put a black eye on our New Years Eve.  No return visit here."}
{"text":"This restaurant specializes in Northern Indian cuisine.
Appetizer: Somosa chat.
Dinner: the lamb Balti was fantastic,   my companion had mutter paneer. Paneer was rich and flavorful."}
{"text":"Placed a take out order, the paneer tikka appetizer was made in a curry dish rather than a dry appetizer mentioned in their menu,moreover the container was half empty. The entree Shahi Paneer was the same curry taste as the panner tikka, no change in flavors.Both dishes were loaded with heavy cream, had no salt and did not taste good.Never going back. Much better places in Cleveland available."}
{"text":"They improved the Dahl! It  definitely is, the best Indian restaurant in Cleveland. I just hope they get their extension sorted out as it's very tatty and uninviting"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Loved the food and service. Very kind staff. 
We ordered the vegetarian platter under sides and chicken tikka masala as an entree. The veggie samosa was out of this world and so was everything else from the platter. The tikka masala came with rice and we ordered the naan bread (thin, fluffy and crisp) to scoop the bowl clean. We had enough leftovers for another dinner. The portions are big enough to share. Thank you Pari for bringing Indian to chesterland. 
We will be coming back!!
As a side note, you have to gesture for the check which is common in other countries and made the experience even more authentic."}
{"text":"Tried the \"a la carte\" as well as the weekend lunch buffet. The menu items seemed little extra expensive, however the food is great. The buffet has limited selection, but there is not one that isn't good. Their Nans are really tender and soft. Definitely worth a shot!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to stop in for dinner, the owner came to our table asked us what we liked then offered suggestion. The food was very good and the warm naan bread was excellent. The menu is huge and if you haven't been to an Indian restaurant before it might take some time to get through the entire menu and you may need some explanation on certain dishes. We will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"If you love Indian food, this is not the place. Bland food, my wife's dish was spicier than mine and I ordered my spicier. My sauce was really runny in my butter shrimp. I thought it was soup. Midget shrimp."}
{"text":"If you want Indian deliciousness, then you need to get yourself to this restaurant.  Everything was amazing: from the service to the food. The chutneys complimented the papadums well, veggie and lamb samosas were very tasty especially with the cilantro yogurt sauce, and the Mutter (peas) Paneer (Indian Cottage Cheese) is cooked in a creamy cashew sauce and became my new favorite dish. The sauce does not have an overpowering cashew nut flavor. It is very mild and savory. Can't forget their various options for Naan. The garlic naan was perfectly chewy and flavorful. 
Live too far? Come check out the Holden Arboretum or another green space, work up an appetite by walking/hiking/running, then go Hulk Smash some food from Pari. You won't be disappointed...and if you are then that's on YOU."}
{"text":"Always so delicious! Lamb rogan josh (mild) is my fave and not to spicy. They've spoiled me for other Indian restaurants in the area. It's a wee bit pricier than the rest, but worth it. I didn't even know I was eating substandard Indian until I came here!!!"}
{"text":"I am going to preface this by saying the food was tasty. This is a small family run place that has prices like it is in the high rent district. The waitresses were nice, but not professional. It is a family run place, the prices are  way too high for the level of service, one plate for all courses, no offer to give fresh plates,literally use paper for their tablecloths. A small dish of rice for four diners. My lamb, basically was on the lamb, cause I couldn't find it. Shrimp was the operative word for the Tikka Masalla our friends ordered, perhaps 6 in a soup of sauce for $22. NO VALUE FOR MONEY HERE, NEVER GOING BACK."}
{"text":"I was up in Cleveland for business and saw this restaurant on Yelp.  I haven't had an Indian meal in years. The food here was great, the service prompt and courteous. The portions were large! The restaurant was undergoing expansion when I visited.  The only unusual things were you had to serve yourself beer and wine due to licensing laws and the hours of operation were a little odd for similar reasons.   Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Good authentic Indian food. I especially enjoyed the curry chicken and dessert balls. They also had great tea. I am not accustomed to Indian foods but I enjoyed what I had. Great place for vegan dining."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian place in Cleveland. It's small and perhaps not the fanciest in town,  but very friendly service and flavorful dishes make up for any lack of polish. The cashew cream sauces could be eaten alone,  they are that rich and flavorful. Been through most of the vegetarian menu,  malai kofta is superb and long my favorite dish here. The samosa chat appetizer takes the tasty samosa to a new level with a complex sauce.  Pari is a little gem in this area definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place, but I've been living on the east side and got a Groupon for this place. I figured that I have never had lousy Indian food (even the most average Indian food is good to me). I hadn't looked up Pari before going there, and had assumed my $25 Groupon would cover most of a meal for myself and another person.

Let me say that the food was good, but not great. There are far better Indian restaurants in town, and the portions are not nearly as plentiful here as they are at other places. When we showed up on a Sunday evening we were the only people there and over the course of an hour and an half only one other table showed up (2 people). I don't know that I have ever been in an Indian restaurant so dead. 

We started our meals off with samosas that were excellent, and the stand out of the meal. I had Saag and it was good, but again, nothing outstanding. I also ordered Garlic Naan that was pretty good, but a little burnt, and as with my meal it seemed a little smaller than what I usually receive at other places. 

The service was good, but nothing outstanding. When I went to redeem my Groupon I found it a little weird that the employee copied down some of my information on a notecard (not sure why he needed my phone number - that has never happened). Now, it also seems to be more expensive than most other places I go."}
{"text":"Went there after reading the reviews saying the food is good. My friends and I were thoroughly disappointed. It's terrible food. It's nothing like Indian food should be and the worst part is it's not even fresh. It was so bland and when we asked them to add a little salt they asked us to add it ourselves!! Stay away from this place if you want decent Indian food"}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood, looking for a place to eat lunch, and just happened to come upon this place.  A very nice find.

We both had the lunch buffet.  A lot of neighborhood Indian restaurants do lunch buffets, and this was pretty typical.  Nothing was fantastic, but everything was good to very good.  All the food was fresh, and the place was nice looking for a strip mall.  The waitress was very nice and attentive, particularly for a buffet.

The buffet was $14 a person (not including drinks, tip, and tax).  I won't call that cheap, but not too bad.

I wouldn't travel a great distance for it, but I would certainly come back if I was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I have been here first time because one of my friend told me that this restaurant have newly open and the food is great.so I came to night to try the food with my family my kids and my husband love the food and the price is also ok.
I have listen very good news of this restaurant now I came to know that why everyone is talking about it .this is one of the best restaurant in Cleveland or u can say in America .
The service is great and food is outstanding . This is my best Indian restaurant I had ever eaten before."}
{"text":"Pari is very good. But I'm just not used to paying $20 for Rogan Josh. Seems overpriced for a restaurant with numbered booths. 

The nan was good. 

They forgot our appetizer and brought our main course and never noticed.  

But I'm sure I'll come back. I'll probably pig out on the buffet when I do."}
{"text":"Could be better; mediocre Indian food. Staff of one probably did not understand a thing I said but nodded profusely.  Cost is $2.00-$4.00 over better Indian restaurants, but location in Geauga county is unique."}
{"text":"5 star food, 4 star price. I get the korma dish and samosas at every Indian joint and judge it by that yardstick (and naan).  On that scale, this place crushes.  The food is as good (better) as my Indian friends mother cooks. But you are in chesterland ! Charge appropriately. I understand the Italian joint next door, Guidos, overcharges for mediocre food (and for the love of all things holy, that place is mediocre), but that doesn't mean you should gouge for great food. 

Never mind. We are lucky to have you. Charge away desi peeps. Much love."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food! Large menu, Worked with us on using multiple coupons"}
{"text":"Delicious flavor, great quality and reasonably priced. The restaurant is small and can't accommodate big groups but a family of four works perfect. Great to have this in chesterland"}
{"text":"The staff has been very generous and kind!  The food so far has been brilliant!  I had some Indian from another well know restaurant around town and compared it to Pari Indian!  I have to say Pari Indians Chicken Makhani was  tender and unbelievably, so damn tasty and the Naan bread was the best I've had in a long, long time!  I can't get enough!  A little pricey, but well worth the experience!"}
{"text":"Definitely putting this place on the rotation. I had the chicken saag and lamb samosas. Both were fantastic. This little gem is hidden away in chesterland but I hope more people find it. The interior has a slight diner feel (probably what it was before these guys moved in)  but the food and the service are both fantastic!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, I came here to test out this place before I took my parents here and the service was just lame. And I received water out of a pitcher that was on a table with a bunch others that were covered by a towel, no ice... must have been sitting there all day. Paper over the tables and the rice was very dry. However the Gulab Jamen was spot on with rose water and honey... For $22 average plate, not worth it. Sorry guys :/ and I love Indian food."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back. I just wish it was next to my house. The food was delicious, the selection was impressive, and the service was great. The serve yourself beer and wine station was a little different. I love the different types of naan. Plenty of good choices for vegetarians and omnivores alike. Love the saffron rice. Also they're good at adjusting to the level of spiciness you prefer. I should have ordered another full meal to take home."}
{"text":"This place has the best Indian food I have ever had. Their portions are generous their food is very fresh and the spices are quite unique. We order takeout from here quite often and we are never disappointed. The fresh hot nan bread is absolutely amazing and I can't get enough of it.The owners are very friendly and extremely respectful. Anybody who is looking for Indian food or just to change up of their regular dinner menu should give this place a try."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious Indian cuisine right in lil' ol' Chesterland!  Cannot overstate how good this food is and service is pretty great too.  We've eaten here 3 times in a week!  Even the kids crave it."}
{"text":"Great Indian food. Lots of variety in the menu. Everything was excellent. A surprising authentic find in Chesterland. Looks like a family run operation. Service was a bit slow considering they weren't that busy for dinner on a Saturday evening, but that wasn't a major problem.
This was our third visit there and we'll continue to return."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. 
Friendly service. 
Huge portions. 
Will come back for sure.
Had the chicken Tikka Masala and the non-vegetarian platter.  Even the Indian beer was super-tasty."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet.  It cost $11-12 and was average at best.  I wanted to order off the menu, but the prices were basically double -- for lunch.  I just can't see how this is justified in Chesterland, OH. There are far better Indian options in Cleveland, especially for this price point.

Unfortunately, I still can't get away from this place as the smell has stayed embedded in my clothes for the entire afternoon.

The one bright spot was a pleasant waitress and the baliwood movies playing on the TV."}
{"text":"The food is SURPRISINGLY excellent!! 
We got Groupon. 

** Vegetable Korma 
The texture and flavor are just right to the point. 
We ordered medium spicy. 

** Chicken Masala   
Spicy level 4 out of 5. Really Knicks in the spice level. Chicken is juice, which means the dish is freshly made (unlike some other places which might recycle their lunch buffet CM to dinner). 

** Garlic Naan
Perfect texture. Not too dry. 

Mango lazi is good too. 

We have tried many Indian restaurants in both coasts. This one by far has the best food. Check in on Yelp and get a free appetizer. 

Way to go Pari for the excellent food."}
{"text":"I love Indian food and was so excited when I heard one is to open in Chesterland! Went there with my husband a week after they opened, on a Monday. Monday is a buffet day, which worked out great for us!
The one thing that always bothered me with Indian food is some of it can get real spicy and I can only tolerate so much spice.
I loved Pari because every single dish in the buffet had just enough spice but not overwhelming; so you're able to enjoy the flavors. I liked everything that we tried; I just wish they had butter chicken on the buffet line, but chicken tikka masala reminded of butter chicken and was delicious. The naan was freshly made and I also loved the veggie tempura (forget what it was called on the menu)."}
{"text":"I'd rank this place in the middle among Cleveland area Indian restaurants. The food was fine but not stellar. Service was friendly and accommodating. The decor could definitely use revitalization. With places like Cafe Tandoor and Saffron Patch offering better experiences, I don't plan to return to Pari anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food is not to bad & the staff is friendly. They even have a few beers from India! The buffet is not that extensive, but generally delish."}
{"text":"We like Indian food, and we were happy to find this place. Small family venue. We were greeted as we walked in being the second party there. Within a half hour the place was full on a Tuesday evening. All four dishes we had were very good, but the mild spice is spicy!  Vegetarian platter appetizer can be an entree.  Onion naan was soft and warm.  Seating is booths. A couple of tables are ready to slide together for parties of 6-8. Can't wait to try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Stellar in both food and service, if you're a fan of Indian food, this is the place to go."}
