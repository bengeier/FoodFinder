{"text":"Solid food, nice beer and great service. The bar /restaurant is nicer than the entrance leads you to believe."}
{"text":"I ate alone in the dining room tonight, sometimes I like to treat myself after work.  I was anxious to check out the new food experience.  The young hostess says to me \"only one?\"  I wanted to smash her face in, why didn't her manager ever tell her thats improper?  I've tried to straighten out  this mistake in other establisments but I'm usually meet with attitude. I'm the only patron in the dining room and she seated me as far away as possible, o.k.  Once my server finally shows up at my table ya know what she says to me, \"did ya want somethin?\"  I replied, I'd like to order dinner. OMG.  If the staff keeps this up they are going to go under, you watch. Best $12.00 chicken sandwich, came with fries I've had in a long time.  Server did check on me once or twice to see if needed any thing, bonus.  She hurt her knee and had to pull up her pant leg to show me."}
{"text":"Bottom Line: For travelers - this bar is great!  They stay open until 2:00 am and have great deals on Bar Bites.  We got in around 12:00 am and walked down to the bar.  The place was pretty quiet - it's a hotel bar and it was a weekday.    I can't tell you how much I appreciated that the woman behind the bar was as nice as could be.  She made an awesome Cosmo!  Had to have 2 ;-)  They have a couple of great Bar Bites for $5.  One of my friends got the smothered fries which we all picked off of.  I got a Steak and Blue Cheese Flat Bread that was a few dollars more and it was well worth it.  Very tasty.  As a matter of fact when it got served - the bartender noticed right away that it did not have a balsamic glaze drizzled on it.  She took it back and had it back to me in a flash.  It was the perfect amount of food to compliment my 2 Cosmos and satisfy my late night hunger.  Whenever I am there I will def stop in for a drink and snack.  FYI - Had breakfast there the next morning too.  I thought the buffet was very pricey but I had just a basic breakfast and the price was OK and it hit the spot."}
{"text":"The staff at this restaurant and entire hotel could give some lessons in hospitality and making people feel like royalty!! I'm not sure I've ever been anywhere where every single employee I came across was so sweet, appreciative of your business and hospitable. Constant \"Thank you's\" \"my pleasures!\" \"Have you been helped\" They just wait on you hand and foot! Very attentive and friendly!!  All of this would outweigh and bad food but the food is excellent!! Love this place! They got it goin on!"}
{"text":"Holy cow. Traveling for a living, I really can appreciate excellent customer service at hotels and I received way more than that tonight. I called from my room to order some wings to take back up to my room and Steven answered the phone. He was AMAZING, answered the phone so enthusiastically, he was super patient, and even talked me into having a glass of wine while I waited for my order. When I arrived at the bar I was greeted by the greatest bartender I've had in a long time, she was super punctual, and very alert. While I waited for my order I watched her and Steven deal with a ridiculous customer..he wanted the 'draft' blowing on him taken care of... watching live tv on his phone with the volume all the way up bothering everyone around him, etc... they handled everything so elegantly and professionally. It's been so long since I've seen bar staff at a hotel be SO accommodating, this was really a breath of fresh air. I appreciated absolutely everything. Also the House Pinot Noir was absolutely fantastic, awesome recommendation from Steven and the wings, were perfect."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Horrible food.  At 9:30p on a Saturday night there were only 2 waiters on staff. My salad appeared as if it were a bowl of blue cheese soup...inedible. My eggplant parm tasted as if somebody accidentally spilled a 1/4 cup of salt on it...also inedible!  Staff did not offer to remove the items from the bill when there clearly was a problem.  They did after I pointed it out. This dining experience took over 2 hours making it too late to go somewhere else.  I was also nauseated from the small amount / bites I did eat & had to run to my room to relieve myself. I would give this place a 1/4 star if I could.  Food & service was horrible. The Manager appeared in his 20's, his pants were falling down with his underwear exposed.  Completely unprofessional.  I'm not sure how this place received 4 stars...but this post is only the 7th one so trust me folks...stay away from this restaurant & the Crowne Plaza it was in!  Both horrendous!  I would honestly give this place a 1/4 star if it were possible."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed my meal here and I travel extensively.    Great service.  Great atmosphere for a hotel bar/restaurant.  Stuffed peppers and a burger with an egg on it (NorCal Burger I think).  Sweet potato fries were the crispy type... Although the oil they were cooked could be smelled... Still good.  Beef was cooked to order and on temp.  The peppers were really unique.  I might try these sometime.  Blanched and stuffed with spicy ground sausage on a bed of meaty marinara...  I should have taken a photo but I wasn't fast enough.  Had s local brew beer... Berry beer which had blueberries in it.  Nice."}
{"text":"Met two friends here after work as it was convenient. To tell you the truth I wasn't expecting much being that it is located in a hotel. It actually had a good happy hour with reduced drink prices and cheap bar bites.   I ordered the three sliders and each one was good    Service was great with friendly staff. It is downstairs so is darker than I like and no view but all in all a decent place."}
