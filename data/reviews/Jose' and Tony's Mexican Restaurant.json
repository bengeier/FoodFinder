{"text":"Glenn is right. Unless we were there on the very same \"bad night,\" this restaurant might have more than one. Glenn did forget to mention how dark and gross the place is."}
{"text":"When my husband and I walked in, I thought...this place has to be a joke!  Horrible....why is there a young white female with green hair cooking mexican food?? These people should get fined for calling it mexican restaurant.  We still ordered & saw the cook put every plate in the microwave. ...wow this should be illegal.  DISGUSTING! !"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and was very disappointed.The bartender was friendly and the service was great but the food was bad.The chips were stale and the salsa looked like wet dog food and it tasted worse than it looked.The tacos really had no taste.As I sat there after I ordered my food and tried to eat it I thought what a mistake coming here.I don't like to put negative feedback out but it was so bad it was a must.I was also told a new owner took over a few months ago and I'm not sure that's correct but either way I will never go back even if the food was free.This place didn't seem very clean either, as I sat at the bar to eat my shirt sleeves stuck to the bar a few times as I reached for my drink or food.I feel bad for the bartender cause he seemed to be a nice guy and he can't be doin very well with the product the owners put out."}
{"text":"Pricey for what you get, and basically plain old mexican food. Nothing special. I recommend Mendoza express in Carnegie-much better quality authentic food."}
{"text":"So this place. Have been driving by it for 6 months and finally made it inside. You place your order at the counter and food is brought to your table. Service was fast and the bartender/waitress was very nice. The house margaritas were really good and that was all. My husband ordered the chili relleno entree which looked great but tasted very bland. The sauce tasted as if a can of tomato soup was opened, heated up and cream was added. The pepper was cooked properly but the cheese wasn't melted inside. The rice was overcooked and had absolutely no flavor. I ordered chicken tacos which consisted of bland chicken, iceberg lettuce and shredded Colby jack cheese. I do have to say the chicken was juicy but had no seasoning. Will come back for the margaritas and nothing else."}
{"text":"Wish it was better...how can a business stay open that has worse Mexican food than Taco Bell...Cook was unfriendly. ..food was bland...Margaritas were good."}
{"text":"Jose & Tony's has great Mexican and bar food at good prices. The staff is always very responsive and friendly."}
{"text":"Awful food and a 30+minute wait for 6 wings.  The cheese enchiladas were not even melted and had no flavor. My sons highchair was still filthy after the highschool girl sprayed it down with windex and a dirty rag- I went over it with a wet wipe and it was brown.  Don't waste your time or money- totally sub par all the way around!"}
{"text":"New menu matches Josephs and Anthony's but I went for Jose and Tony's.   Still had happy hour beer price. Hope transition goes well. The now $7 or $8 burrito, no sides, was average.  Miss the specials and sloppy Joe."}
{"text":"I grew up in this area and the first mexican food I ever ate came from Jose and Tony's in the late sixties. I thought it was quite good when I was ten years old. Maybe it was, or I was young and didn't know any better. My sweetie and I just moved back into the area and bought a house in Dormont. I brought her to my \"favorite\" local mexican food joint only to find that it has gone down the tubes. The food is microwaved right in front of you and served on paper plates. What a shame. I wanted to still like it, I really did. Go to Mexi Casa on West Liberty Avenue instead. It's now my favorite local mexican resturant."}
{"text":"I don't understand the 2 star rating. I LOVE Jose & Tony's. We walk there often for food or drinks The inside could use a little updating & outside seating would be a nice addition, but the food is excellent. My husband & I have eaten here 10+ times & were never disappointed. Everything is cheap, good quality and the service is fast. I even love their wings, which you probably wouldn't think to order at a place that serves Mexican food. I like that you just order your food at the counter then they bring it to your table. We've never had a problem finding seating either. I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Unfortunately my wife likes their dried out sandwiches, so I have been there multiple times. My take out food tonight was MISSING one of the 3 components of my combo dish and was accompanied with a brick of crunchy dried out beans and flavorless rice. These were clearly cooked long ago and sitting there waiting to be ordered. I only gave one star because Yelp does not allow me to give the ZERO stars that this place deserves. It would be very difficult to dissatisfy me more."}
{"text":"Jose and Tony's? My husband reckons there was a misprint on the sign and it should read \"Joe's and Tony's\". This is terrible Mexican food and a drab environment.       All of the food tasted like gas station food. The spanish rice tasted like rice that someone just squirted a bunch of ketchup on. There is no natural light in the place. Food was served on styrofoam and paper plates.  PLEASE AVOID FOR THE LOVE OF FOOD!"}
{"text":"Man... I've been going to This place for a few years and the reviews seem so off base.  It's a dive bar with good food, nothing more nothing less.  They have GREAT food specials and food drink prices.  Give it a shot for what it is. A friendly neighborhood bar with great people and food food."}
{"text":"Jose and Tony's is a great spot to grab some tacos and beers in the neighborhood. It's not your typical sit down restaurant - you order your food and pay at the window, and then find a seat, and get your alcoholic beverages at the bar. I have been there a handful of times, and I have never had an issue finding a seat or being taken care of in a timely manner. The servers are all friendly. I  always get the carnitas tacos, and I have yet to be dissatisfied. The atmosphere is laid back, which I love. No outside seating, which is always sad in the summer months."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, I don't get the hate against Jose & Tony's. I really don't. I've been visiting this place occasionally for years and have grown to love this interesting little place, which has a bar on one side and a little eating area with a stand you can order from on the other. In fact I stop in here now and again when I want to grab a drink specifically because they're a Mexican restaurant/bar combination, not just an eatery.  Drink-wise, I've never had a bad experience. They make ok Long Island's (not the best admittedly) and extremely good, strong margaritas that are hard to top elsewhere. The bartenders are always extremely nice and have actually made some really good impromptu drinks on the spot for me when ingredients for my favorite beverages run out. So drink-wise, these guys win in my book.  As for the food, while it's not exactly out of this world spectacular it's honestly really good considering the fact that I'm just looking for something to eat as I enjoy my drink. I look at the options as bar food, and by that standard things here are really quite good. You can't go wrong with chips and salsa, and their beef quesadilla's are honestly quite good as well - I ordered one last night and couldn't get enough of it. (By the way, these guys are one of the only places where their quesadilla's come with mushrooms - that's a big plus in my book!) I've had the Mexican dessert as well and really, really enjoyed that. Honestly my only complaint about Jose & Tony's is that they don't offer smaller portions for late night snackers like myself - I always bring a friend or family member with me so I don't have to eat my entire dish.  You'll definitely see me stopping in again in the future - here's hoping more people show some love for Jose & Tony's soon!"}
{"text":"I really do enjoy this place.  The food may be microwaved, oven baked, or deep fried but what do you expect?  There is very little authentic Mexican culture in this restaurant other than the decor.  Having been to Toluca Mexico this is exactly the sort of decor you will see there.  The food is absolutely Americanized.  If you go to Mexico their food is very bland, J&T food is very flavored.  Plus they serve pizza and wings.  The bar serves authentic margaritas.  Full of tequila and lime.  Great pitcher specials.  I've taken my MIL here and she was in margarita heaven.  When you go in there is a dining room, to the left is a balconyish area. Through the arches is the bar.  If you sit in the balcony area please try to think of the kids in the dining room because this is a family friendly restaurant, least before 9.  After 9 if you have small children there then you should reevaluate your understanding that any place where the length of the bar is almost the length of the building.  There is a great chance that it is going to get colourful eventually.   Please also remember when you go here you at the beginning of the South Hills.  This place opened up before the 80s and has been through some owners.  This is not like other popular \"Mexican\" restaurants.  I give it four stars because of the bathroom situation.  One stall for women?  Not cool.  When the employees are keeping the customers from going then you have a problem.  Plus the parking.  Parking sucks for lunch but in the evening the building next door allows you to park there.  Much better for an evening crowd or a quick bite during lunch.    I really like this place though.  If you are not up for something fancy then this is your place."}
{"text":"Didn't try the food, but the margaritas and chips and salsa were great :) Fun people and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"If it was possible to give a restaurant negative stars on Yelp, as in minus 3, I would do that here. Jose and Tony's is a bar masquerading as a Mexican restaurant, and doing a very poor job of it. I do not believe that anything is made from scratch here, everything we had was microwaved (I watched), and I imagine you can get better Mexican food from the frozen food section of your local Giant Eagle. In fact, I suspect that's exactly what the owners of this place have done; raided the local grocery store aisles for pre-packaged, canned and frozen \"Mexican food\". For shame. I would fill out the \"additional tips\" part of this review, but who cares? Just don't go."}
{"text":"It hurts my heart a little to see all the one star reviews.  Jose and Tony's isn't the best, I'll admit.  Could I get better food somewhere else?  Sure, in fact I could probably make a better burrito at home.  But the prices are reasonable and the bar has excellent drink specials.    I've tried several items on the menu and yes, nothing is all that spectacular.  But you know how sometimes you just want to taste that square pizza from the school cafeteria again?  Jose and Tony's makes me think of the tacos also made available in grade school cafeterias.  The smell and taste just take you back to simpler times - before taco shells tasted like Doritos.  More importantly, you just can't put a price on nostalgia.  I started coming here with a friend who came to Jose and Tony's when she was growing up.  She always had fond memories that she shared with me.  Combine that with a pitcher of reasonably priced margaritas and I start to feel all warm and fuzzy.  I will always have room in my heart and my stomach for one more taco salad from Jose and Tony's."}
{"text":"Abolute garbage microwaved food. Not very clean either. Table was not even wiped off. Burrito made me feel sick after eating half of it. You have been warned. Taco Bell is so much better by comparison."}
{"text":"This is a tale of two teachers, a married couple, looking for cheap and good Mexican eats the week before their first paycheck since June. They ended up at Jose and Tony's, and they got the cheap part, at least.  The good part, not so much.   Now, I'm known to be a lover of food. I especially like seefood, meaning just about any food I see. I'm also one to give the benefit of the doubt in my Yelp reviews because any restaurant can have a bad night. But for some reason I can't do that for Jose and Tony's. Why, you may ask? Read on, MacDuff.   Question: How does one mess up a Patron Reposado margarita? By using something akin to prestone antifreeze for the mix and taking fifteen minutes to make the damned thing even though there were only 5 people in the whole restaurant. Mystery meat tacos that reeked of meat left one day too long in refrigerator before cooking. Tortilla chips that were stale and partially rancid.   See what I mean? I can't even say \"nice..., not thrilling, but nice.\"   Again, it was cheap. Under $20 for drinks and dinner. I only wish I could have finished any one of the items I ordered without feeling sick to my stomach.   So in summary... in my college days, maybe... juuussst mayyybeee... I would have enjoyed the place, but only because I wouldn't have known any better."}
{"text":"Everything about terrible trash n over priced that's this place! I'd rather eat out of a fast food dumpster. Be cleaner and taste better how is this a business?"}
{"text":"I love this place. Yeah, okay, it's not Taco Bell. Like that is a friggin sin these days. It's not authentic Mexican... It's not Tex-Mex... This is Burgh Mex! And it's danged good!  It's a great local bar and burgh mex food place."}
{"text":"Nothing really that makes it a Mexican bar.... ? Wings are good. Anything else is freezer burned and microwaved. Cheap booze. Attracting the dormonster crowd"}
{"text":"First thing I'm gonna say is dont take a bus full of nun's here. My grandmother would not enjoy this place. Its a little dirty, kinda shady, but solid grub.   I enjoy these kinds of places because I feel like I could spill things on me and not have to worry about people scoffing at me (people are probably too drunk to notice here).   I've probably been to better mexican places in wyoming but hey it's better then a microwave burrito and after a few beers, who cares. Don't pay attention to the 1 stars, just go check it out yourself."}
{"text":"Tex-Mex definitely not authentic Mexican but good and they have a large menu,"}
{"text":"Love it.  They have a cigarette machine and a gum-ball machine.   California Burrito is the thing to order.  Mexican beers cheap.  Draft beer cheap and tastes good.   Service is the best."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Jose and Tony's in probably 15 years.  But a much needed lunch date landed me here. It was nostalgic. The place hasn't changed and that's the beauty of it.  It's simplicity. Jose and Tony's isn't fancy and it isn't trying to be. As you might guess from the name, they serve Mexican style food.  I had one of the lunch specials. For $6.99 I got a delicious California burrito and a taco. Again, nothing fancy but it was good!  And a good deal.  The staff is friendly. You order at a window and they bring the food to you. It's a great place for lunch and they have a great bar."}
{"text":"Well , Here is another once \"Great\" restaurant that has thrown away the quality and reduced portion size. .....WHY ????   You had a good thing going ? I was always hooked on the California Burrito, It had great flavor and great size. Now it tasted like a ground up wendies burger with very limited spices.  Please bring my Burrito BACK !"}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times, mostly because it's convenient and near friends, additionally they have trivia on Tuesday nights and a good taco special.    The food is alright...if you are comparing it to taco bell, HOWEVER they have reasonable drink prices and a good atmosphere.     They also have very good prices comparatively to other Mexican joints.     It's a good place to hang and have a beer with some friends, the food though is there...nothing special, not good, not bad, just bland."}
{"text":"Not sure why all the one star reviews, this place has decent \"Mexican\" style food. The chili is top notch, no beans, meaty, savory and has great umami features.   The California Burrito is gooey with cheese, great filling and a delicious sauce. Sure, everything is served on paper and you get plastic forks and knives, think of it as good truck food without the truck.   Good beer selection and specials."}
{"text":"The absolute, worst fake Mexican restaurant in all of the land.    This place is in the top rankings for the worst restaurant experiences as far as ambiance and food.  Service was more like a hipster food truck that did not know what they were doing.  Avoid at all cost.  Wow.  I have nowhere to begin, other than this was our first take on Pittsburgh cuisine and it was downright confusing, aggravating, and really just yuck.  The food was more reminiscent of TV dinners and Oscar Mayer Lunchables than crafted cuisine.  Actually, microwaved Mexican snacks are better.  We left absolutely stunned.    If the Huffington Post's Latino Voices section got a hold of this joint, they would label it as racist and it would appear across the national media, because it is just that absurd and confusing on all levels.  Even for someone that would never call someone racist for a cultural misunderstanding.  Whew. Breathe.  It is mind-boggling that this place is still in business as I was very surprised to see the sign still up as we happened by it earlier this evening.  The only thing keeping this place in business is the bar - which is certainly NOT a Mexican or even a Cali/Texas bar experience or anything to write home about.  And you will seriously have to get blitzed beyond any other shitty Mexican experience to keep this food down.  If you want an incredible Mexican experience in relation to this place, simply go to Chipotle, order yourself something - ask for extra meat as they are typically skimpy in places like Pittsburgh - and order a Negra Modelo or Chipotle margarita.  If you close your eyes and allow the alcohol to do the work, you may just find yourself in Mexico.  In Jose & Tony's case, they obviously have never even experienced Chipotle to know the difference to pop their balls of confidence to open this place in the first place.    To offer positive comments to improve: Drop the fake Mexican and just go for bar with the basics, you already have the concession-like experience of a sports stadium to succeed within that category.  I would assume ice cold light beer and the nacho cheese would be an extremely popular item for people to provide positive yelp reviews.  Otherwise, take a flight to Mexico with some armed guards or take a weekend in Houston and you'll know Mexican when it hits you in your face with authenticity, experience, and flavor."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. The menu, from what I understand, has changed from its original and is better. When you walk into the joint, the dining room is small and you place your order in at the counter. The bar is on the other side up a little walk way. I usually get my margarita at the bar before my food comes out. Anyway, the food is decent. I am not tremendously disappointed with the food. I am, however, disappointed in the cost. I have been to a few Mexican restaurants here in the Pittsburgh area, and the prices are never as high as they are here and are more authentic. The employees are very nice and bring the food out to your table and try to accommodate you as best they can. It's not your typical Mexican establishment. I would call it more of a Mexican American place. They have TVs to watch a game on. The place is not pristine, but it's not scary. The burritos are very big and filling, and the chips and salsa are very good. It's a good place to go, locally, for a quick bite. Overall, the place isn't bad, but if you want authentic and more of an atmosphere, I would recommend looking around."}
{"text":"I remember the day, years ago, when I would excitedly run down the street to Jose and Tony's for a taco and ice tea. I would go after school and the entire meal would cost me less than two dollars.  Jose and Tony's is staple part of Dormont. It closed for a while, then reopened under new owners, and the food was the same. I always loved Jose and Tony's.  It has been a while since I have been there. I live quite a distance away. But I was in the mood for a taco and decided to go down there. The Decore and menu are still very similar. But the food is different. It's not the same. If you go to Jose and Tony's and expect the same food you got 15 years ago you will be sadly disappointed. But if you go in there expecting a more authentic Mexican fare then you will love the changes.  I really did love the new tacos. They were beef tacos not beef and bean or bean and beef. They were beef. They were hearty and just enough feeling. The salsa was delicious. I haven't had a taco that good since I went to Brookline Boulevard and got one off the cart. And that is exactly what their new tacos remind me of.  I am going to have to go back and try some other items. I ordered a fresh salad for later, the lettuce was shredded and crisp and the vegetables are fresh. My only complaint is they did not have any homemade dressing. I truly believe all restaurants, unless there a chain take out, should have at least one homemade dressing.  Jose and Tony's was a good lunch, served quickly, and priced right."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU WANT GOOD FOOD!!! The \"food\" was served on a paper plate being not cooked, but microwaved (I watched this go on in dirty hole they call a kitchen).  A 10 year old could have made better food. I don't remember what I ordered, I think my brain tried to wipe away any recolletion of the experience at Jose and Tony's."}
{"text":"In business for longer than I have been on this earthly plane, Jose & Tony's is the \"The Room\" of Pittsburgh eateries if they are to have a cinematic turkey of an equivalent. For most of my life, I've been told by friends, family members, and strangers to avoid the J And T. Yesterday evening, Kay and I took a gamble on Joe 'n Tony's since they're near our chiropractor...just to experience it for ourselves.   And it really wasn't THAT terrible.   To begin, we found J&T's to be warm, cozy, clean, and welcoming. The place was not at all sketchy or grimy. Our chipper, pretty young server was a joy to be around. She appeared to almost dance about like a ballerina or a sprite as she waited tables, charming patrons both regular and unfamiliar of all ages. We adored her. The clientele was well-behaved, and the ambience was surprisingly tranquil. No one was rowdy, loud, or noticeably sloshed.   We shuffled up to a counter and referenced a menu on the wall located just past a cartoony mural prior to choosing our poison. Astoundingly cheap for Mount Lebanon, we ordered aplenty, and our cute, fun new friend brought all of our food to our table without delay after we paid up.    I'm hand-wringing here as I compose this review, and it's mainly due to the fact that, well...J&T's apparently nukes everything and makes no effort to disguise it. The unshaven cook and I even met eyes when he did the radiation tango with my Burrito El Grande. Almost shrugging, he seemed to say to me with his facial expressions, \"What? You got a problem, mac? This ain't Casa Reyna.\"  Served between piles of Spanish rice and refried, cheddar-riddled beans, the large burrito was filled quite generously with ground chuck...  ...and hell, my Mom makes better Mexican than this. I coulda made this myself. The beef wasn't even seasoned. There are packets of spices sold for this sort of thing, y'know?   Las Palmas Carniceria, a local chain of Mexican groceries known for their popular sidewalk tacos, grills all of their beef regularly on a flat-top. Whatever isn't used immediately goes into a steam pan. There you have it: Zero excuses for microwaved entrees in a restaurant.   I couldn't view all of the kitchen action, but it seems to me that the cooks merely assemble each precooked dish and irradiate it for service.   If you keep the food hot or cook it to order, you shouldn't have to do that, right?  Robert Irvine would be livid. I can see that muscled Brit of Food Network and rescuer of eateries gone awry pacing about now.   Spare yourselves the drama, guys. My mom''ll teach yinz things ya never knew about homecookin'. That's if you want help, and judging by the attendance figures, your business is still surviving and thriving.   J&T's also sells burgers, pizzas, hoagies, and...what's that?   Mmmm...*crunch..nosh...licks fingers*   They do make dandy, juicy, crispy, meaty chicken wings, and they were only $5 last night! In fact, our entire meal only cost about $30, which is theft or charity in this end of town.   What else did we dig?  OH! Jose and Tony also make their own \"sour cream dressing\" as they call it, and rather fetchin' it is. It almost tastes like a prepared dip you'd find in your supermarket's frozen section OR as if they married creme fraiche to Hellman's mayonnaise. It went swimmingly well slathered onto my phat burrito, one that really didn't kill the pooch despite its prefabricated origins.   I also indulged in their *ahem* \"Mexican Dessert.\" Psst. It's fried tortilla chips dusted with cinnamon sugar, and yes, they too were appetizing in a state fair kinda way. Gimme a paper cone of 'em and show me where the ski ball booth is. I got a teddy bear to win for my gal.   This is their other dessert offering, and I am not putting yinz on. 2 bucks gets you...this...  http://bottomlesswit.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Choco-Taco.jpeg  *Beep*  *Slam*  That goddarn microwave wouldn't be ignored.  Ah! I ordered guacamole too. It wasn't inedible either (nothing we had truly was), but it did have a little too much acid and not enough salt. I prefer it to be chunkier to boot, but hell, I doubt it was bought from an outside vendor.   At least I hope not.   Feck it, though, I make better guac than than Jose and Tony's! It ain't hard. I break up the avocado with a spoon, add kosher salt, some mashed garlic, and a squirt of lemon juice. Magic.  To conclude, think of my 2 star rating as a strong 2. Crud, all they need is a good chef or my mama's recipes. *nudge* She's as Latina as Don Sterling is a soul brother.   P.S. I didn't enjoy lambasting Jose & Tony's. Honestly. Color me frustrated more than snarky. Damn it. I wanted to like them! I wanted the haters to be wrong!  For a neighborhood institution, that grub should be fresh and scratch-made!!! I wanna see a meat grinder! A tortilla maker! I want everything to be fried in lard! NO. MORE. MICROWAVING!  P.P.S. The outside of the joint has been gorgeously redone."}
