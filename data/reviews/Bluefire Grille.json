{"text":"Had very high hopes for this establishment.  The online menu is different then the menu when you get there.  We both ordered burgers. My wife's had a ton of jalapeños on it that were incredibly spicy.  We both like our burgers medium but when these got to the table they were well done.  My burger was missing ingredients that were described in the menu."}
{"text":"This is inside the Hilton hotel. I arrived about thirty minutes prior to closing. I had a chicken sandwich that was the best I've had in a while. The wait staff was not too attentive. Is this a Scottsdale thing?  Seems to be that way all week here."}
{"text":"Was here for a week for a conference off site and for the first time, I looked forward to my room service every night. The Cobb salad was my absolute favorite.  The breakfast was food and included all options you'd want."}
{"text":"I'm only leaving 1 star because I have to.  I'm not sure if it's typical Arizona service or not, but took 10 minutes just to get menus and then another 15 minutes went by and we were still sitting with no sign of waiter. Asked the people at the bar if we could get service and just got a \"sure\" and 10 minutes later still no waiter to take our order.  Got up and walked out.  Wouldn't have wanted to inconvenience anyone \"working\" there...God forbid they actually provide service."}
{"text":"All I'm saying is this place provided me and my girls with the most pleasant start to our day. The staff was the most attentive and welcoming group ever. Fabiola, the omelette bar specialist made us delicious omelettes and even walked one of them over when one of my friends wasn't paying attention instead of just letting it sit there to get cold. 

Our server Marianne, however, was the true superstar. She took care of us like it was her job. Okay, okay- so it is technically her job but she did it with the kind of pride you don't really see in the restaurant service industry anymore. To me, that means addressing the needs of your patrons even before they are voiced. And she did just that when she made sure our water glasses were always full and helped even my most indecisive friend with a customized off-menu solution in no time flat. 

One of my friends said she would even come back just to visit Marianne. No, but for real.. She's moving out to Arizona and doesn't have any friends yet so hit me up if you have any leads for her. ;)"}
{"text":"I've learned not to expect much from hotel eateries but Bluefire Grille still managed to disappoint.

Located at the Hilton Resort in Scottsdale, this alcove just off the main lobby suffers from a combination of overly ambitious menus and underwhelming service. Dinner, even at 7pm with just one other table seated, can be an ordeal. A harried looking waiter was pleasant, if distracted. The menu was scattered, covering salads to duck to fish. 

An intriguing starter dubbed 'Scorpion Prawns' were described as U-10 prawns (big suckers) tempura coated and served with a chipotle cream cheese. The prawns were much smaller, but quite tasty. Looking for something lighter, I went with the duck salad: slices of duck on top mixed greens with sliced green apples, crumbled Gorgonzola, and candied pecans, all tossed in lemon-champagne dressing. A good mix of flavoura and textures, though the duck was just south of room temperature and verging on 'cool'.

Breakfast the next morning wasn't a much better experience, with a larger crowd leading to a few errors in service. An order of a pomegranate smoothie arrived at the table as a fruit oatmeal and grapefruit juice was forgotten. What did land at the table was, however, a satisfying meal to start the day."}
{"text":"I was completely ignored when I stepped into this restaurant tonight. As a guest in this hotel this had got to effect the over all image and customer experience. 

I sat at a table in the bar area and no one bothered to say hello, that they'd be with me, or ev ed n looked in my direction. 

Based on reviews and the empty tables tells me there's a problem. I'm out."}
{"text":"Came in hoping to get in/out for a quick lunch. 35 minutes later, no meal....and it was simple: Taco's! Anyhow, once we got out food it was ok. 

Not sure if this place just opened, but the staff seemed a bit confused."}
{"text":"you guys scared me so I just got the burger
excellent fries
friendly staff and very responsive but it was Wednesday night and no one was there
typical hotel food"}
{"text":"Christine does a great job!... She needs a raise!. I have visited here many times and service as always been top notch!...Rhx for another wonderful evening."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! Just terrible service! Rude, hostile and confrontational. Such a disappointment for a Hilton property! Very sad folks. If I were you I would take a hard look at what goes on in this restaurant. Worst service I've ever had and mediocre food!"}
{"text":"Dined here for breakfast several times and at night for drinks before retiring at the hotel. It's a rather smaller dining room and a big U bar. Bar closes at midnight daily, which is good since so many places nearby are closed after 10, except for Old Town area. 

The service is friendly at all three occasions. Breakfast buffet is your standard buffet with scrambled eggs, bacon (one of the best I've had; nice and thick), sausage links, French toast, potatoes, bread bar for toast, oatmeal, pastries, and cheese and meat board. On Sundays, they have an omelette station too!

The bartender made my drinks as requested (good old fashion drink) and our nachos at night hit the spot. Only complaint why was the inside bar closed and the outdoor bar opened on a Saturday night, in December?  It was freezing at night.  It doesn't make any sense. 

Anyways, a good dining option if staying at hotel. Flemings steakhouse is also inside this hotel as another, albeit expensive, dining option too."}
{"text":"As the principal dining spot within the Scottsdale Hilton Resort, The Bluefire Grille really doesn't try very hard to elevate above the level of \"expensive and mediocre.\"  Perhaps they believe that Hilton guests are a captive audience, a serious miscalculation with so many good restaurants within walking distance.

Service, even with a near-empty dining room, is unbearably slow, while at the same time presenting themselves as being under enormous pressure.  Of the 6 breakfast items ordered by the four of us, one was incorrect (not even close) and a second was completely overlooked.  What was brought to our table was prepared without passion, and struggled to reach the level of \"eatable.\"  

Yet, the breakfast problems paled in comparison to the dinner service.  As the only diners in the restaurant, being seated should not have taken anywhere as long as it did.  Once seated, the \"10 count\" prawn appetizer (i.e.- shrimp of approximately 2 oz. each) came to the table as shrimp of less than half that size, clumsily wrapped in eggroll wrappers and fried.  Aside from the fact that 3 different wrapping techniques were employed, this misrepresentation is clearly fraudulent.  My crab salad entrée wasn't bad, but family members who chose the duck and apple salad were considerably less positive in their assessments.

The Bluefire Grille presents itself as an eatery blessed by a good location, but with no serious intention of remaining in business.  Regrettably, and IMRHO, The Bluefire Grille thoroughly denigrates the guest experience of the Scottsdale Hilton Resort."}
{"text":"Our experience here was amazing. The atmosphere was nice and the huevos rancheros were the best we have ever had. Living in New Mexico we have had huevos rancheros at many places but this is truly the best we have ever had, delicious."}
{"text":"We went to the BlueFire Grille to check out the new menu announced by new Chef Doyle and the new remodel. The remodel was quite nice but the good time ended there. We ordered Fish & Chips and even though there were only ten other people in the entire restaurant, it took 25 minutes for us to get our food. Unfortunately I have to admit this was the worst fish and chips I have ever had and I have had many. I'm pretty sure the fish had been frozen for awhile and then deep fried to a faretheewell so that it was really chewy and rubbery, yet still fishy. Ugh!  And pretty spendy for bad fish."}
