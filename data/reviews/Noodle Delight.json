{"text":"Do not EVER come to this place. The food is as disgusting as their service. I asked for a bag to take my leftover food and they berated me for 10 minutes after wanting to charge me for it. The older man and lady ( presumably owners) should NOT be in the service business. 

DISGUSTING! They should be shut down."}
{"text":"Noodle delight on Victoria Park south of Sheppard ave E is an excellent place to grab a quick bite. Their noodles are excellent and the dishes are tasty and fresh. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for something quick and inexpensive to eat, so we went to Noodle Delight. I used to go to this place when I was a teenager, and the food is still just as good as it was 20 years ago. I have never had a bad meal here. I usually order the \"Bangkok\". This place is consistently delicious. You get good value for your money. The portions are large, and the price is fair. For $8.35 you can have a meal that will fill you up. 
Also the decor hasn't changed in 20 years. I like that though. Maybe I'm just nostalgic. Service is not very friendly, but they're not rude either. However, your food is always fresh and hot. 
If you're in Scarborough and you're looking for good noodles, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"curry beef and curry chicken is awsome?If u order beef things in here?I think you got a right place?Chicken wing is atrractive?"}
{"text":"I love the food there always fresh lots vegetables . Always friendly service you feel like home when you eat there ."}
{"text":"BEWARE don't ever go to this place if you are a vegan! I told the woman behind the counter that I wanted rice noodle pad thai, but without meat as I am a vegan. She said no problem at all.
We went home and my sister passed me the container that said veggie. I had a few bites of it and the next forkful I pulled out a piece of chicken.
I immediately went to the bathroom and threw up. So very gross. 
Don't trust this restaurant to give you the food that you ask for. Who the hell knows, maybe it was cat in my container. I wouldn't put it past this place. 
I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS RESTAURANT A ZERO"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 20 years. It's fast, tasty and consistent. It's fast food so don't expect fine dining but I come year after year because it's clean, cheap and delicious. I have Bangkok, Kwung Tung, Beef Tenderloin."}
{"text":"Absolutely sub-standard. Not even a fortune cookie with lunch.

We order the Jakarta Satay w/ noodles. Over drenched in sauce..not the least bit spicey, and next to no meat or vegetables...mainly noodles.

Many other chinese places in the are would be better than this."}
{"text":"I really rate this place a 3 but I give it a 4 because of the history that I have with this place.

Straight to the food. I love ordering the Kwung Tung (reminds me of Cantonese Chow Mein - noodles with pork, seafood and vegetables), Szechuan Chicken (I always substitute the rice for noodles - don't ask me why lol) and Beef Brisket on rice. This has been the holy-trinity of staple dishes that my family has been ordering from this place since I wee little kid.

While certain things have changed (namely my taste preferences bordering almost snooty-like at times, and my dislike for \"fake\" asian food) I can't help but still love this place despite it's oiliness, increased cost (my $5-6 combo is like $8-9 now) and the stomach ache I get when finishing a whole order to myself (note to everyone reading this: SHARE your food, portions are pretty big :P). 

If I ever get a craving for this type of cuisine and I'm in the area, while there are half a dozen other asian restaurants I would prefer to go to, I will without a doubt choose Noodle Delight on occassion when my nostaligia gets the better of me.

Note: the chili oil is serve-yourself, unlike some places that are stingy with the stuff."}
{"text":"This is a place with potential but it doesn't stack up to its old self when it was Noodle Delight.  The H&S soup is gloopy and punchless and the beef and bb noodle I had was extremely greasy.  The old place had wonderful broth in which the noodles and other ingredients were literally poached.  I always assumed this broth was used as their soup base.  Now, large amounts of sugar and salt are used to disguise the insipid stock which may well not be stock at all.  For an extra buck or two, they could reclaim the quality their food once had and, with a little promotion at nearby York University, this place could really rock.  I'd love to see these guys put a little thought into how to improve things.  I was shocked at how few customers they had compared to the good old days."}
{"text":"Lunch time on a Friday afternoon. Busy busy but very efficient kitchen despite the confused person taking the orders at the counter. 
Simply place your order (hint: be nice to people behind you by knowing what you want BEFORE getting in line!) then step to the right.
Ping! Order up in less than 5 minutes.
Tables are plentiful but never enough at busy lunch time.
No problem the wait for a table is very short and allows the food to cool to a temperature that will not cause damage to your tongue.
Flavors are great. Lots of food. Enough to share.
One complaint. Fountain drinks are tiny when compared to other fast food joints in the area. 
Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Once Noodle Delight and now renamed  Noodle on Finch,  this place is as good as ever and sometimes even better with good size portions at a reasonable price.  Seasonings may differ depending on the chef who cooks your noodles, but that's part of the appeal.  Utilitarian eat-in surroundings.  A favourite with athletes (or big men that just happen to look like football players)."}
{"text":"I love the noodles here and have been a regular for years.   The decor is tired and worn but who cares?  In fact, maybe I should just keep this place to myself.  Yes, don't go.  Stay away. It's all mine."}
{"text":"It's now called Noodle on Finch, but this is one of the three old Noodle Delight franchises still in business.

Stumbled on this location by accident, noticing the old green tables and similar menu that gave it away. I was nostalgic for some Noodle Delight, so I went in.

Dishes had different names, but I figured out my favourite dish: Stir Fried Rice Noodle with beef and bean sprouts. It was just like I remembered: delicious and greasy. My friend ordered the chow mein, which looked the same but the sauce was off.

I will definitely come to this place again. Authentic noodle dishes from various East Asian countries. If you're looking for some Chinese comfort food, look no further."}
{"text":"This is my favourite noodle place in Toronto and I've frequented it since I was four or five years old. My parents took me when I was little. They used to be where the Starbucks is, but so happy to rediscover them in my twenties.

They have noodle styles from all over Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Japan, and mainland China. My favourites are Kobe (aka ho fan), Shanghai, Kwung Tung, and Black Pepper Beef. They also have daily noodle specials, so if you're not sure what to get, try the special.

They'e open late and you can also do takeout. The portion sizes are huge and economical (dishes under $10). If you love Chinese food, definitely try this place."}
{"text":"This place is really a hit and miss. 

I read the reviews on this place, and the decor isn't THAT run down! 

I've been coming to Noodle Delight since I was little and before it became one with the plaza. It used to be a stand alone restaurant. It was always the place my family went to, when my mom just wasn't in the mood to cook. 

Couple of years have passed, I've moved out of my moms house and now raise a family of my own. As soon as I walked into Noodle Delight, a wave of nostalgia hit me when I saw the same rounded green chairs and run down menus with the same pictures, dating from the 90's. 

When I was a kid I always got the Noodle Delight, so why break tradition? I can't remember the exact taste of it from a long time ago, but it wasn't half bad. Its just hard thin egg noodles with a cup of steaming hot flavored sauce that you pour on top of the noodles yourself. Its honestly comparable to Cantonese Chow Mein, except I feel the Noodle Delight is lighter in taste with just slices of meat, green peppers, carrots and raddish. 

My boyfriend got the Kobe. Which was just thinly sliced beef, fried up in oil, soy sauce etc alongside flat noodles. I tried it myself, and man, grease mania, but the flavor and seasoning wasn't half bad! My boyfriend seemed to have enjoyed it, including the greasyness. 

This isn't a place I would 'Rave' about. But if you're looking for fast food Chinese, and are in the area, give it a try. 

Its not the Noodle Delight I remembered when I was kid, but it can pass off as decent enough food."}

Date Visited : Friday April 27th 2018

Wife and I happen to be craving noodles after work.  I remember coming to this resto years ago.  I was hoping that the quality of the food hasn't changed.  Glad I was right, food is still good.  Portion size seems to have improved over the years in my absence.

We ordered the Pad Thai noodles and the Seafood Egg Meon Shrimp.  

Service : relatively friendly staff.  Seems that this is the first chinese resto and a noodle oriented place at that we have dined at, and I didn't see any chopsticks.

Food : 4/5
Pad thai, I'm not an expert on Pad thai, but we found the dish to be enjoyable.  Tho the fresh ground peanuts were a tad on the salty side, nice chewy noodles and the dish was served hot.  As for the Egg Meon Shrimp, the dish wasn't as hot (maybe it was cooked first) the tastes of seafood were really really subtle in this dish.  The only items providing flavor for me, was the fish cake and the shrimps.  Way too much sauce and since it was using ho fun noodles (flat rice noodles), they don't exactly soak up sauce very well.

Beverages : 
Water situation : looks like they only offer tap water, bottled Dasani water is $1.54 a bottle. 
Bottled drinks are $2 bux each + tax.  Soft drinks in can are $1.37.
If your on a budget, I'd recommend bringing your own drinks, or stop at the Subway Sandwiches 2 doors to the left and refill a reusable bottle with cold water, I bought 3 cookies and refilled our 2 bottles with cold ice water

Method of payment : Cash & Debit, not sure on credit cards

Repeat visit : yes, there are few more dishes we are interested to taste.  Sadly have to avoid the dishes with beef, due to beef being a gout trigger for me.

Update : May 10, 2018
Visited on May 9th, and the quality dropped and so did the portion size for what we ordered.

This time we ordered the Hong Kong noodles and special Sweet and Sour Pork chops w/steamed rice.  Both dishes we requested without any bell peppers.  They granted the request, but the portion size was way less than our previous visit.

The Hong Kong noodles were soooo soggy.  1/5 for the Hong Kong noodles on this visit.  I'd give 3/5 for the Sweet and Sour pork chops w/rice.

There are still more noodle dishes we are interested in trying.  Just skipping the ones with beef, due to beef being a gout trigger for me."}
{"text":"Noodle Delight was fantastic in the early '80's when they first opened up at the other end of the plaza.

These days I find that their food is pretty bland, and very overpriced when you compare it to some of the other traditional Chinese places that have popped up around Scarborough.

My advice is drive the extra mile into Agincourt and get some REAL Chinese food.  It tastes better and you won't have to dig as deep into your pocket!!"}
{"text":"Don't think I would really want to eat inside this place...
First time there and I didn't know what to order.  Asked the lady what she would suggest and what I got was pretty good. 
They only take debit or cash and since I was on a business trip I didn't have cash on me since I just use credit card and expense it. 
If you pay by debit, they charge you a $0.35 fee."}
{"text":"Groove is in the heart...
The chills that you spill 
Up my back keep me filled
With satisfaction when we're done
Satisfaction of what's to come. 
I WOULD ask for another
Oh yeah, I'd ask for another (that's right)
Your groove I don't deeply groove.
Ugly walls only the bridge
My Supper dish
My super tasty wish
I'd ask for another

Watch out!

Reviewing Noodle Delight is like reviewing a mom and pop shop burger joint.  It's the asian equivalent to fast food burgers.   Now normally I ONLY order the Brisket soup noodles and very rarely stray away from it.  And now I remember why.  I had the curry chicken special which for $10 includes a watery hot and sour soup, a flattened fountain drink, a greasy spring roll (which wasn't too bad) and the wateriest blandest curried chicken I've ever had in my life.  Not only was it not any kind of curry I know, it should have been renamed \"essence\" of curry water.  It did come with giant chunks of chicken, but if it's going to be so flavourless, you could provide me with the mother of all hens and it's not going to matter.

Service has always been the same here since the dawn of time.  It's fast food, where you go up to the counter and order, and the set up is like Harvey's, but they always somehow make you feel like they're doing you a favour by providing you the food.  The turn around time is always amazingly quick, and that's the bottom line that keeps me coming back.  When I'm in a rush, this is the place.

I know other things have been okay here, like beef fried noodles and the sweet and sour chicken that I've known other people to have ordered.  But from now on I'm sticking to the brisket.

Groove is in the heart.. 1-2-3 brrrrrr.. *pop*  C'mon, ya'll are crazy."}
{"text":"This is basically the Chinese equivalent of a burger joint. It's fast. It's cheap. It's a bit greasy. There's no service. Dine in or take out, you'll get your food in a Styrofoam box. Self serve tables with an area for condiments like salt, straws etc. 

In the same way that I can't imagine anyone going out of their way to eat at McDonalds, I don't imagine anyone coming to Noodle Delight unless it's out of convenience. I work nearby so it's not such a bad choice for lunch. But it's definitely not my first choice for lunch.

Portions are large. It's $7.50 for noodles. If you want H +S soup + spring roll, it's a combo for $8.98. One order should be enough for one very hungry man or 2 average women. 

How's the quality? It's what I call edible. It's the kind of food I'd only eat when I'm really hungry. When I'm not that hungry, I'd rather wait a bit for better options (or just eat at home). I had the pad thai once. It tastes nothing like pad thai from a Thai restaurant. It tastes more Chinese than Thai. I mean...it's not disgusting or anything. It's pretty much how I feel when I eat a burger - It's nothing special, but it'll fill your hunger and your wallet won't have to be sad. 

I would come again if I forget to brown bag my lunch. Otherwise I'd never deliberately come here. This is one of the cheapest options in the area if you consider the price-portion ratio."}
{"text":"Chinese fast food but not in a food court. 

I was able to get a fish ball noodle soup within 5 minutes (not even) and sit comfortably to eat it. It's not the nicest environment, but I've been to worse. Good for a quick meal with friends or solo with a book. 

My fish ball soup was very basic. With 2 pieces of choy and a side of hot chilli oil. The menu is really diverse with other cooked dishes in addition to noodles."}
{"text":"Literally A-OK.

Decent bang for your buck, especially if you work in the area. There is one old guy who usually makes the food better, but overall not the kind of place you take your partners to.

As mentioned by other reviewers, they used to be a heck of a lot better, so if you haven't been since '08...expect changes. Hope they do improve though, place has potential.

Also, if you're not into msg, ask them to cook without it. I'm not actually if it's a placebo affect, but well... helps."}
{"text":"I received very friendly and quick service for once. The Schezwan Chicken was way too spicy and greasy however. It is usually alright, but wow was I disappointed. The Pad Thai was spot on as usual. So much food, leaving plenty of leftovers."}
{"text":"I dropped by here with two of my buddies and we all ordered the Yang Chow Fried Rice.  I chowed down no more than six spoonfuls because it was laden with grease.  My friends didn't eat much of it and told me they felt as if their arteries were clogged.  

I decided to give this restaurant another shot so a week later I came back and ordered the fish fried rice.  To my disgust, it felt like I was eating a tray of salt.  Yuck.  Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Noodle Delight has been here for years and has kept the the good quality and  great value since then.

If you are looking for fast and cheap Chinese food without sacrificing too much quality, you have come to the right place. After placing my order, it came out in in about 5-10 minutes. This place is great if you're on the go or want something quick. Portions are nice, about half of a full styrofoam container.

My favourite dish is the kwung tung, which is basically pan fried noodles without it being crispy. There's beef, broccolis, and shrimp inside mixed with some sauce or gravy. I'm pretty sure my mom ate this while I was in the womb, hence my love for pan fried noodles and Noodle Delight's Kwung Tung!

The inside of the restaurant is a little dated, but still clean. I would probably opt to take out if anything. 

This place is a staple for cheap, reliable, and fast Chinese food located in Scarborough."}
{"text":"It's been 15+ years since i last ate at Noodle Delight. I used to go there all the time! Inexpensive, delicious & quick to order!  Yes, the decor is still in need of an update, but I'm not there for the decor. Was I ever excited to see that it was still around!  Hubby stopped in & ordered on his way home from work. It was fast & easy to order and nobody was rude or rushing him.

I had the Kobe noodles which is beef (super tender!) with bean sprouts, onions & their special soya sauce. Huge portion with lots of beef! After 15+ years still tastes as good as I remembered!

Hubby ordered the beef brisket for himself. Which tenders pieces of cubed beef which is cooked in a sauce which hubby described as tasting like ginger, garlic with a glaze like texture etc. Served over rice.

We had take-out. I was skeptical at first because i figured with the drive to Markham, that our food would be cold. Not the case at all! 

Sorry no pics this time! Food didn't last long enough in front of me, but i will post some from my next visit back!"}
{"text":"Website says lunch special is $8.98 bit they charge $10+tax and say their website hasn't been updated since December.. false advertising should still be honoured"}
{"text":"The service has always been great here. I recently tried their new menu item like the Laksa noodle soup or the chicken bitter melon, not everyone's cup of tea... I know. I'm glad they've introduced new dishes. I'm always a fan of the spring rolls and chicken wings."}
{"text":"This particular restaurant has been here for many years.  Not much selection of Chinese eat spots in this area other than the Mandarin across the street.  Lot's of menu items to choose from.  Price for each entree is decent but I have been to other places in the Markham area which are cheaper and taste much better.  Fast food for sure but if you're expecting it to taste any good you will be disappointed.  Too bad it hasn't changed after all these years."}
{"text":"Over priced disgusting food. $7.5 for a noodle with no flavor at all. With this food it only worth $3 top. I ordered the noodle with beef and green pepper.All the noodle is stick together. Too much sauce and yet there's no salt in it. The green lepper tasted funny and sour. Stay away from this restaurant. There are alot of good quality Chinesefood in the area with better price."}
{"text":"Rude older female.  The food is mediocre at best.  Like someone else said on here, it's pricey for what you get.  There are a lot better places in the area.  Go to Pharmacy and sheppard and you'll find a variety of chinese places that offer better service and food for a better price.  Going back to my first line - the older lady that works here is very rude.  Although i like the gentlemen that looks like he's the owner, I definitely won't come here again just because of the rude lady."}
