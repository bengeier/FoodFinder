{"text":"We celebrated a New Year Party in this restaurant: high quality service, friendly personal, warming atmosphere and interesting show program. The best New Year for us!"}
{"text":"I've made a Yelp account for the sole purpose of writing this review.   Today, I had the displeasure to eat at this god-awful restaurant. A few hours after eating there, MY STOMACH STARTED HURTING. Both my girlfriend and I had upset stomachs after eating here. The food tasted bland and, like other reviewers here mentioned, they do not know how to cook a steak. I asked for medium-rare and they gave me a well-done steak instead. That is only one of the many examples I could give from my experience there.   My family chose this place due to its convenient location. If you have a choice, please save your money or use it to eat elsewhere. Sorry if I can't write anything good about this restaurant, my stomach is just killing me right now."}
{"text":"Not bad! Numerous things improved significantly, they replaced the veggies with fresh Greek salad, refreshing and tasty.  Souvlaki is great, and the shrimps and scampi are well seasoned and freshly prepared. Hopefully they can expand their appetizer menu soon."}
{"text":"The food was okay but when you have a group it isn't the fastest service. I recommend going as a couple or just a few people not as a group (10 or plus)"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of coming to this crappy restaurant at least 3 times and every time it's been nothing but garbage. I get it it's cheap byow but you don't have to serve nasty food. Vieux Duluth is bring ur own wine 100x better. Anyways besides how terrible it is the service isn't great either I spoke with the owner and he gave me a extra stamp in my casa grecque passport which I laughed and left behind."}

{"text":"On December 27th my Finance & I hosted an engagement party dinner for 30 people here. To our pleasant surprise upon arrival, we had our own room. The seating was great, having two long tables side-by-side. The service was great, the guests were very happy. The appetizers came out really quick - service was definitely not slow. I was impressed by their efficiency.   I asked most of the guests how their meal was and I only heard positive things. This restaurant is BYOB/W, so you have to bring your own booze if you want to drink.    Personally, I wasn't so crazy for my culinary experience but at the same time I think I didn't order the right things... The shrimp cocktail appetizer is no good. The sauce it comes with is too mild and sucks. The shrimps are too big for me and they kind of grossed me out. They were also super cold and that also grossed me out too. I sent it back and they were kind to give me the shrimp gratine instead. This was good, I enjoyed that. Then the Greek Salad w/ Feta cheese arrived. They should indicate on the menu that this \"salad\" DOES NOT COME WITH LETTUCE. It is chopped marinated vegetables with herbs and feta cheese. Had they included lettuce with this meal, I would have been extremely satisfied.   Casa-Grecque in Lasalle is excellent for large groups and the price is pretty affordable. Bathroom was clean and the whole restaurant was decorated very nicely with garland and white mini-lights. Red bulb ornaments were hanging from the ceiling, it was really lovely."}
