{"text":"I don't know if they accidentally gave us the gluten-free dough, or what, but the dough/crust had no flavor. None at all. It was like eating cardboard. Did they just forget to add salt to that batch of dough? The bland sauce and toppings didn't help either.

I'm sorry, Lucci's: I hope not all your dough is like this, but I am not likely to return."}
{"text":"This pizza place definitely has some things to offer. I wouldn't necessarily choose it over the other Murray Ave options on a regular basis, but it has its virtues.

I had a pizza with onion and green peppers and a Caesar salad. The salad was great with fresh garlic croutons. Definitely a plus.

The pizza had tasty, non-sweet sauce and nice poofy crust (which was, however, sweeter than I like my crust to be). The onion topping was great, but the \"green pepper\" was a mix of green and red, and I think they were either roasted or slightly pickled. Not my favorite thing. The pizza was good in the shop but a little underdone and thus slightly runny--the leftovers that I rebaked in the oven the next day were better.

I liked the sauce better than Aiello's, and I appreciated the good selection of six packs, but in general I think Aiello's wins out for better cheese/crust/baking time. However, Aiello's leftovers get too done in the oven, so it depends on what you're after. 

I will probably return when specific conditions align."}
{"text":"We came here because it was the only place in Squirrel Hill (that I could find) that advertises gluten free pizza. My 8 yr old daughter had that (plain cheese) and the rest of us had regular pizza. 

As other reviews have said, the woman at the counter has a really brusque manner. I decided, after a few interactions, that she was basically friendly, but she comes across as harried at best. 

The only significant negative is that our pizza seemed to take forever. It was 5:30 on a Tuesday and we probably waited 20 minutes. When it did come, it was good. The GF crust (from Gluuteny, across the street) was probably the best I've ever tasted, and my daughter gobbled it up. The regular crust was good too, though a bit softer in the middle than I like it (but I like soft chewy edges, which it had, and it's tough to get those and crispy in the middle too). Toppings were generous, although the ham (though it looked like ham) mysteriously tasted more like sausage.

A little card on the table advertises a few beers on tap, but they had none. The paltry selection available in cans were all of the Bud/ Coors Light ilk. Not that I expect a microbrewery in every pizza joint, but something like Sam Adams would have been nice. Maybe they were awaiting a shipment, since the case was nearly empty. 

Verdict: for gluten free I would go here again. But otherwise, unless they can speed up the service, I'll stick with Mineos."}
{"text":"Lunch review...  i work near here so we occasionally eat lunches here.  The food is better than average compared to all the other itallian dives around here, but yhe service is pretty slow.  
I've had their italian hogie and it's good, there are better salads around (johnny's wife's place too, D's best sandwiches), their pizza is average, and their pasta seems to be hit or miss depending on the day. In total I've been here 16 times and only once for dinner."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good, and the prices are decent. I've ordered from them several times. However, the pizza never seems to be cooked fully through, it's always thin and doughy in the middle."}
{"text":"We have had 2 bad experiences with Lucci's.  The first time we went in to buy a six pack, and we had to wait for at least 10 minutes to check out when there was no one in the restaurant.  The second bad experience was when we tried to order delivery from them.  It was 9:00, and their menu said they were open until 10.  We live about 3 minutes driving time away.  They wouldn't deliver.  The lady stated that they stopped delivering at 9 after asking where we were located.  The menu by no means states that.  I would figure that an hour would be plenty of time to make a calzone and a salad... Needless to say, they will never receive our business again."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in Lucci's.  The delivery person was kind of rude, and wouldn't come to my office despite being in the building.  I got a veggie hoagie and it was incredibly bland, they didn't put hot sauce on it like I asked (why give customers an option for a sauce if you aren't even going to put it on there?), and it was mostly soggy bread.  I almost never write negative reviews, but this was not good, will definitely not order from there again."}
{"text":"To clarify before the review... I have never posted a bad review on any websites until now.  HOWEVER, after my experience here I felt compelled...


My beef is not with the environment or staff, in fact they were very accommodating (which is the only STAR that they actually deserve)

I've lived in Squirrel Hill for 4 years now and have tried Lucci's 3 or 4 times in those 4 years.  After every episode I walked away with the \"ehhhh, pizza was not that great\" thought.  At least I gave them A COUPLE of chances before really coming to my senses.

Anyhow, tonight I figured \"what the hell\" I'm pretty burned out on Aiello's, Amier's, and the rest of the Sq Hill shops so maybe I'll see if my taste buds for Lucci's had changed.

In short....ordered the Buffalo Chicken pizza (I'm a fiend for buffalo chicken anything).  I was starving so I'm usually less judgmental on taste per se.  However, THE PIZZA WAS HORRIBLE.  It was WAY too salty and the cheese just stuck together and came off as one large disgusting piece after I picked up the first slice of it.  It was completely void of any resemblance of a \"buffalo\" sauce and tasted more like they used a buffalo seasoning or other low grade supplement.

Once I managed to slop a chunk of the already overcooked and disgusting cheese back onto my initial slice I took one bite and almost gagged.  It seriously tasted like they dumped an entire shaker of salt on it, not to mention the cheese just fell right off again as one molded clump.

Conclusion...the pizza WAS, IS and will forever STILL be HORRIBLE comparatively to the other shops around the area.

Haven't tried their hoagies or other items, but if their pizza is any indication of what to expect from their other varieties...it would be wise to avoid like the plague and not waste your money or taste bud's over."}
{"text":"First and last time I'll do business with them. 

The pizza I ordered was barely warm, but I was hungry so I threw a few slices in the microwave. When I called to complain, I was put on hold for several minutes and told that the deliveryman had seen it come out of the oven with his own eyes.
This didn't change the fact, I told them, that it wasn't hot and, in fact, the cheese wasn't melted at all.
Later that night, I got the bad news that something else was wrong - I had food poisoning. When I told them yesterday what had happened, they were something less than sympathetic.

If you value your health, stay away from Lucci's Pizza and Pasta."}
{"text":"Love their gluten-free pizza!  This place is a godsend for those of us with gluten-issues.  Crust comes from the Gluutenay bakery, so you know it's right.  They are careful to use a separate cutter for the gf pizza.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time with my brother and his gf.  I'm new to the area so I will try just about any place once. We had the deep dish with half pineapple/pepperoni). Aside from the crust being a little greasy (which it usually most times for deep dish) the pizza was very good. Sauce was a nice sweet thick but not too thick consistency and the dough was fluffy and not heavy at all like you would see with Pizza Hut's terrible deep dishes. I'd go back again to try their regular pies and dishes. Eating area was clean and large with two TVs (thankfully not too loud that i couldn't have a conversation) and a generous selection of beers and non-alcoholic drinks. Prices weren't bad either, large deep dish with the two toppings was $12."}
{"text":"I'm not from PGH, but I was recently in Pittsburgh for a few days, and I went to Lucci's twice in a row! Really great pizza (and this is coming from a serious pizza fan who has sampled pies from around the world.) Not greasy, great crust - not too thick or thin, and a nice balance of cheese and sauce. Plus, you can get six packs to go, and on a Sunday to boot. Staff was pretty friendly and helpful, and made sure to give me lots of red pepper in a small takeaway container when I asked for it.

Overall, I say this is a darn good pizza joint, and I will be back on future trips to Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"I'm going to be a bit biased, but that's only because I love Italian food.  And because Lucci's is fabulous.

Lucci's is apparently related to the Luciano's restaurant of White Oak, PA.  I have no idea if this is true or not, but I have heard that the little brother of the one that owns Luciano's owns Lucci's.  It isn't difficult to believe this because their menus are quite similar.  However, I prefer Lucci's.  

Lucci's is much smaller than Luciano's.  Even so, it never seems too crowded and there's space to mover around even when you're there for dinner.  It's also not as noisy as Luciano's, and I attribute that to the normal height of the ceiling.  I always feel like everything is echoing about in the cavernous ceiling of the older brother's restaurant.

The menu is fabulous.  I love the bruschetta appetizer.  They use thick, artisan bread, and don't skimp on the tomato, basil, garlic and cheese topping.  The marinara sauce is also really nice.  I've also have the fried zucchini, which i really liked even though I'm not huge on zucchini regularly.  My friends had stuffed hot peppers, which they really liked.  I avoided them because my stomach would prefer it that way.  I've had the cheese ravioli and a calzone before.  The raviolis were quite good, and weren't dry at all.  I've been to places where it's seemed like they've popped the ravioli into a microwave and brought them out (Olive Garden), but this wasn't the case.  The calzone was fabulous and huge!  I only ever eat half, and save the rest for later.  It's a great price, too, at just about $10 for a whole (That may be an over-estimate, I can't fully remember).  The calzone is everything one would want in an Italian calzone.  My only disappointment was the lack of gnocchi on the menu.  I think they should work on adding it.

The last time I went, two friend ordered pizza: a spinach pizza for one and just a pepperoni for the other.  The spinach pizza takes about 45 minutes, so make sure you tell the waitress immediately, and she'll put it in to start with the drinks before getting everyone else's orders.  This worked well and all the food came out at once.  Word of caution: these are the heaviest pizzas that I have ever held.  The crust is super think and they really stack on the toppings.  You get what you order and more that you've paid for.

The waitresses are great.  I've had some better than others, but they're mostly high school girls, so this is to be expected.

Overall, this is a great restaurant.  It's super reasonably priced, and I would even dare to say that it's cheap.  For the amount of food that you're getting, it's really a steal."}
{"text":"Lucci's is the best pizza in squirrel hill (take THAT mineos and aiellos). Checkout the Chicken Supreme, but either way-- you can't go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"I don't go here anymore!

I've gone here about ten times and the pizza is okay. The location is the main reason that I end up picking it. The sauce is my favorite part. Don't know if they make it themselves (kind of doubt it based on the place).

I usually hit the place around 6pm and about half the time, they are out of slices, which is a bummer and when the woman who seems to be the manager is at the counter, look out because her customer service skills border on sadism. She can be really abrasive and acts so harried, like asking for two slices of pizza is just soooo difficult a request for a PIZZA place to handle! She should never be in front of the public in a service role because she is really terrible at it.

Plus, at those times when I've been stuck at the counter trying to get them to complete my order, I couldn't help but notice the DIRTY kitchen floors and work surfaces. Yuck. 

The last time, I ordered two slices and the waiter dropped off one slice on my table, so I thought, okay the other must be on it's way. BUT NO! I had to go up and ask for it, and then they had to heat one up for me. I don't know what was going on that day but I resolved to go to Aiello's or Napoli's from now on."}
{"text":"My doc recently recommended a gluten free diet, a total bummer for a carbophile like me.  That said, had I been looking for normal pizza, Lucci's cumulatively subpar rating would have dissuaded me from ordering from them.  Since they appeared to be the only place that delivered gluten free pizza to my neck of the woods, however, I decided to give them a shot.  

Fortunately, my experience was positive all around.  I GrubHubbed my order and the very friendly delivery dude had it to my door within about 40 minutes.  The pizza itself was pretty delish, though the cheese was fairly greasy.  The sauce was nicely tomato-y and herb-y (I'm a weirdo: sauce is my favorite part of a pizza).  The crust - well, that was something magical.  I'm typically not a crust fan whatsoever, but this crust was thin and crisp with a pleasantly chewy bite.  I even gobbled the edges up, which is unheard of for me. 

4 stars this time.  I look forward to ordering from here again."}
{"text":"We waited 10 minutes before a waitress came to the hostess station and said \"sit wherever you want. I'll get to you when I can.\"  Okaay- we sat at one of the few cleaned tables and the same waitress came over and told us we couldn't  sit there. Asked her where we should sit and she pointed to a table that was dirty. I asked if she could clean it and she walked off. We waited several more minutes before she came back with a rag grumbling that it wasn't dirty. At that point we left and I spoke to manager about wait staff. He just shrugged. Couldn't have cared less. Will never go back. We've encountered rude staff here before. Just don't need the attitude."}
{"text":"Super tasty traditional italian red sauce type of place!  The sauce on the pizza was a bit spicy for our four year old but he was more than happy with his kids plate of spaghetti with a giant meatball.  Great Caesar salad and excellent pizza with a variety of good toppings.  Dinner for four including an 8 slice pie, huge Caesar salad that easily fed 4, 1 kids pasta and a haf order of a fettucini Alfredo, 2 beers, 3 glasses of wine  and one Milk for just 50 bucks.  Yummy and felt like a real bargain to these visiting new yorkers."}
{"text":"I was starving when we got to this place in Squirrel Hill so we started with the fried zucchini. I highly recommend it - generous-sized portions with marinara sauce on the side. The drinks are from the coolers (no fountain drinks, which kind of bothers me sometimes, I like fountainy things with pizza) but the food is not terribly expensive. We went with the white pizza and it was perfect, cheesy and melty and garlicky."}
{"text":"Have tried Lucci's a few times, food is generally good but you never know what kind of service you will get! My wife and I stopped in last night around 6:30 for dinner. We decided to sit at a high top in the bar area. There were 4 people at the bar and we were the second table  to be occupied. We waited over 5 minutes to at least order a drink. Not once did anybody come to take our order. Another customer came in sat down at a table in the bar area and after a few minutes the bartender went over and took there drink order. Never even acknowledging we were there. After joking around with some of the other waitreses they finally got their drinks at which time she went back behind the bar again not even acknowledging we were there and she definatly saw us sitting there. At that point we got up and left and will not be back !"}
{"text":"Ordered take out from last night. Everything was delicious fresh and hot. The delivery guy was very nice. I love the sauce and the stuffed peppers are perfect. All the good is delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza (both traditional and white pizza). My only gripe is that they use canned mushrooms instead of fresh--unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Yes, sometimes driver's get lost, sometimes pizza places screw up, sometimes (i guess) it takes 2 hours to deliver a pizza within a 1/2 mile radius WITHOUT ever apologizing unless badged by the customer. Always nice to get attitude over the phone for their screw ups and a ton of attitude from the driver. Was the pizza any good? Not that good. Avoid."}
{"text":"Food was good, portions are average. French fries are delicious and atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"There are so many pizza places to choose from in Squirrel Hill and although I have only tried 3 different places, this is by far my favorite. If you get a pie for take out I recommend putting it in the oven for an extra 7 mins., that's if you like your crust crispy because my only complaint is that the crust is too chewy for my taste."}
{"text":"Great inside service and pick up as well! We often order the buffalo chicken pizza Togo too. Best buff chick pizza EVER. I've never had the pasta, salads, etc but always buff chick pizza & it's awesome."}
{"text":"The white pizza is wonderful, as is the pasta lucci. Generous portions, really nice staff, family friendly atmosphere. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I just tried to order a pizza from Lucci's, and was unpleasantly surprised by the price being significantly higher than their menu ($18+ instead of $13). In addition to there being a 'misprinted price' they wouldn't honor, they tack on several bucks for delivery and make no mention of it on their menu. 

I wish this review could be about their food, but they lost a customer with these shady business practices before I even got to that point!"}
{"text":"I am what I eat.  And I am a massive perperoni pizza. Don't let the beer belly fool you.  I am only a decent peperoni pizza.  Nothing special going on here. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had in 19 years of living in Pittsburgh.  Heads and shoulders above the other more well-known shops on Murray ave.  The pizza is delicious, the salads are fresh.  The marinara sauce has a great kick to it.

The service? Terrific.  The staff is warm and friendly.  

Yea, I'd like fountain drinks, too, but it's a small price to pay.

My only complaint?  We were there on Friday night when it was frigid-ass cold out, and the draft from the front door was bone-chilling.  We moved to the side near the front to be out the way, but then the chill through the windows hit us.  Lucci's:  Invest in a second door!

Even with the cold, it's our new favorite pizza joint."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Every time i go there I get their deep dish pizza and its consistently delicious.  My wife loves their breadsticks and i must say they are great as well. The service is good. Location is good. Its just a solid place that has never let us down so five stars it is."}
{"text":"Pizza, Just Pizza!

I hear the chatters of the people, \"were going to Lucci's, Lucci's is bomb\" and so on. Not like I have never eaten at Lucci's before, but it's not on the regular agenda. To be honest, I really don't remember what I even ate my previous trips, which leads you to believe that it's nothing to write home about.

I stopped on my travels the other day cause i was in the area. It was just after they opened around 11:15. It was quite chilly in the bar, and there was a few at the bar, and a couple in a booth at the end of the row of booths. Not busy, we were in the mood for a supreme pizza.  there is no supreme pizza. There is a chicken supreme, but know regular supreme. If you build your own supreme it can get quite pricey. So we kindly asked if we could swap out the chicken for Pepperoni..no problem. Just saying...they need a supreme, or you pick 5 toppings.....again, just saying. 

Now don't take that for a bad review. The toppings are fresh, the pizza was crispy, & I loved the crust. It's just that I LOVE me some pizza, so the pizza has to jump off the table and do a jig on my plate to be remembered.

So go to Luccia's, it was good! I just can't rank it over a 3 for pizza standards.

I will be back to try some other dishes. 

Jedi Approved"}
{"text":"Good pizza, delivery, can pick up a 6 pack and save a trip to the nearest beer and pop emporium, and they gave me a luccis/steelers schedule magnet to boot!"}
{"text":"I've tried all of the pizza joints around squirrel hill, and I think Lucci's is my favorite.  I usually just drop in for two slices for dinner.  Their slices are much larger than the other places and are very tasty.  I think Mineo's might beat them slightly in the taste dept, but for all around pizza joint, I pick Lucci's.  It's less crowded too and a good deal."}
{"text":"Avoid. 

Summery : Everyday comfort 3 star food w negative infinity service.

I like their wings but I am horrified of their woman manager who gave me a ridiculous attitude for calling twice within an hour and half, for not having my pizza delivered (she said \"Didn't I tell you we might run behind a little?!?!?\") And i just LOLed when they forgot my coke and ranch when they finally came. Again, avoid.

Order from little nippers or papa davinci whose owners are super nice w better food (They do deliver to squirrel hill). Much better pizza and much better customer service who at least know how to appreciate their customers."}
{"text":"Good food reasonable price. I had the lasagna was prepared excellent. Service was very good"}
{"text":"This place has definitely gone down hill! We were very unhappy with the service we received when we went a few weeks ago... also ordered delivery tonight and it took 1 hour and 15 minutes to get to us. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Just came here today and trying to decide how I feel about it...

Pro's: 
*The server we had was very polite. 
*The wedding soup that came with my meal was pretty tasty
*We went on Tuesday which was spaghetti night! The pasta and sauce were both enjoyable 

Cons: 
*The restaurant is very cramped! If I stretch, or talked aggressively with my hands, which I've been known to do, I was going to smack the stranger next to me
*I understand giving out a fresh loaf of bread with a meal at an Italian restaurant but expecting your guests to cut it in a bowl is absurd! I watched everyone around me struggle just as much as I did.
*$2.80 for a beverage is one thing $2.80 for a small beverage with One refill... Give me a break
*My step father ordered the chocolate cake. Granted it was a huge piece of cake but for $6 it was lacking in the taste department. I'll take quality over quantity any day.

After writing the pros and cons I'd say over all the experience was good. The food was very enjoyable, I left very fat and happy. I think next time I'd probably get carry out just because I prefer a little space when I eat and I can enjoy as much free refills at my house as I can handle!"}
{"text":"I've come here twice now - both times I've been treated to some solid chewy (in the good way) pizza with a swell sauce. The place is well lit and clean, so eating in isn't nearly as awkward as it is at some of the other local pizza joints. And the price was right, $5 for 2 decently sized cheese slices (but a caveat: I'm here from Boston, and haven't totally adjusted to Pittsburgh pricing yet.)
 I was going to give them 4 stars, but honestly, I racked my brain and couldn't think of a single complaint about the place. So I gave them 5 stars for that, and having a sale on Sam Adam's Octoberfest this week."}
{"text":"Huge fan of their sauce and raviolis... The fact they deliver makes doing business with them very easy."}
{"text":"You mean someone will drive to where I am in their car and bring me pasta carbonara? All I have to do is give them a few bucks? Life could be worse than that!

I have never eaten in at Lucci's, but I have ordered delivery and takeout from them on numerous occasions.  Sure, you can get about 6,000 places in Harrison City to deliver you Italian-style food of one kind or another, but the thing about Lucci's is that you can get entrées of a pretty decent quality, not just pizza and appetizers.  

And their carbonara is DIVINE.  And lethal.  But worth it.

Their pizza's not bad, either."}
{"text":"Recommended by locals, but really not much to celebrate here.  Next time I'll try the pizza, since that seems to be their main business at the carry out window.  The food is ok,  very average offerings, not much excitement in the taste, but good if you are in a hurry.   The carry out selection of beer is very limited, so don't expect any high quality bottles.  The service is friendly and efficient, and we didn't experience any problems during our visit.   Ill give this place another try, and go for the pizza."}
{"text":"Great place for any occasion!   Classy yet relaxed atmosphere.   Excellent food.  Wedding soup and marinara is amazing.  Great staff."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Lucci's many times.  The food is always decent.  The service on May 25 was horrible.  It actually ruined our evening.  First it took over 20 minutes for our order to be taken.  There were only 2 other tables {6 people}.  We had 6 at our table.  Three of us were served our meal and the other 3 had to wait more than 15 minutes.  If someone's meal was going to take longer why serve the others?  Reading the reviews I see that a spinach pizza takes long, I think someone had that, but what about the Italian hoagie or the chicken parm?  We were not told that the pizza would take so long. Very slow at drink refills (I'm talking beer) and the coffee we ordered never arrived.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Terrible! I was busy with work so I ordered delivery via GrubHub to save time. The pizza took two hours to get to me, cost $18 for a small and a drink, and it was cold! I almost had to leave the office for a meeting before it arrived since it took so long. I will never order from this place again. 

The delivery guy was very nice and said he was new. He was possibly the only good part of this transaction."}
{"text":"My husband and I were taken to Lucci's a couple days before Christmas by his mother and a family friend. The restaurant is a little small, and the tables are very close, this is certainly not a place you'd want to go for an intimate Italian dinner with a date. 

I personally found the menu a tad disappointing. No manicotti and no gnocchi, the two dishes my  husband and I were planning on ordering. He ended up getting spaghetti with meatballs, I had the chicken portabello. I also ordered a glass of the house white wine, our waitress had to be reminded to bring that out. Otherwise service was great!

The food was definitely tasty. The complementary bread tasted fresh baked. My chicken came with asparagus in addition to the mushrooms, and I stole a bite of the meatball my husband had, delicious! Everyone in our party enjoyed their food, and the portions was large enough that we all had leftovers to take home! 

Overall, an A-OK spot to get some Italian grub!"}
{"text":"Overall, I'm a fan of Lucci's. The food is good and the prices are decent. The same family owns Lucciano's in White Oak (way better) and the new Brick House in Irwin (way worse!). 

My last visit to Lucci's was a week ago with my husband any my parents. My mom and I got the Seafood Pasta with fettuccine noodles, shrimp, mussels, and clams. Also came with a side salad. The pasta was delicious and there was so much I took more than half home. It left enough for me and my husband to split it the next day for our lunches. My husband and dad got the Pasta Diablo. They both agreed that it was good - with a little kick to it. (They both ate the entire thing so that's proof....)

My complaint is the way the place is managed and the staffing. I've been here on about a dozen occasions and sometimes the service is great and other times....meh. On this particular occasion, it was packed. (The busiest I've ever seen it). Tuesday night at 6:30....who knew?! There were no booths in the dining room and one booth in the bar that needed bused. Well, there was a waitress chatting with a couple at the next booth over, so I ask her if we can have that open booth. She says yes, that 'someone will clean it for us' and walks away. We go over to the booth and wait for the dish ware to be taken away and the table cleaned off. Three or so minutes go by before a waitress comes over and cleans the table. She goes on to explain that this is the bartender's section, but her and the other waitresses will help her out because she gets pretty busy. So I supposed that was to explain that she was doing the bartender and us a favor. Gee, thanks.

Well, as the meal goes on, I notice that there is one bartender, who is in charge of the bar area, of course, as well as the five booths in the bar. And I have to admit, this girl rocked it. She was friendly, efficient and busy the whole time. (Frankly, she had no time to stop and chat with anyone). Problem was, there were 5 waitresses in the dining room....which is maybe twice as big as the bar. But, any bartender knows, it's tough to be a bartender who has to watch tables, too. Especially when you're a woman....a lot of people just want you to chit chat with them and don't care that you have other people to serve.

I was very disappointed that there wasn't someone else to help this girl out. Why not have a runner or someone to help out between both the dining room and the bar? The bartender did great, but someone else may have not been so successful. Especially with the other waitresses' us against her mentality. 

For me, a favorite restaurant is just as much about the service, the layout, the cleanliness, and comfort as it is about the food. 

Food is good....staffing situation needs fixed. Even if someone called off, they should have shifted people around to help out in the bar area. I'm guessing that people in the bar area probably stay longer than those in the dining area, as well. Take note, Lucci's!"}
{"text":"It's over priced greasy salty pizza. Some people enjoy it, it's just not for me. As Kevin Malone would say, it's like eating a hot circle of garbage. The only thing I had worth getting is the chicken parm"}
{"text":"Lucci's is a pretty straightforward place, so I'm giving it a pretty straightforward review:

-Good pizza
-Good toppings
-Good prices
-Food took surprisingly long to make (especially since it wasn't very crowded)
-Hoagies were bland and mostly bread

I'll probably come back for the pizza (it was quite good with sausage).  I doubt I'll come back for anything else."}
{"text":"I am a bit confuzo, since when I read my last review (written but a month ago!) I go on and on about the deliciousness of our pizza....yet when we got some last Saturday night, we were both a bit more underwhelmed.

The pizza wasn't too different - tasted a little less fresh and delicious for some reason - but it was really the wings that bummed us out.  We got a dozen hot wings, and we were both displeased.  They had a soggy texture, mealy on the outside (maybe from the soaked breading?) that just wasn't appealing.  It may just be our preference for unbreaded wings, but we were disappointed by them.  Threw the last one or two away instead of saving them for later, since we just weren't really interested in eating them again!

I'm sure we'll get the pizza again since it's right by our apartment, but definitely no more wings."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times now, and I am totally impressed by everything about this place, especially the food and the service!

Everything is delicious and tastes homemade. I've gotten the lasagna, the chicken carbonara, the eggplant Parmesan, and more dishes that I've absolutely enjoyed! All of the sauces I've tried are absolutely delicious, and I love the white sauce especially. The portions are always huge, so you'll have a meal for two days!

The fresh baked bread that comes out before the meal is quite delicious with the olive oil and herbs! I also enjoy both the wedding soup and the salads with homemade balsamic dressing. Overall, I'd say this is a place you need to try for the food alone!

Additionally, the service is fantastic! The people here treat you great, and you'll feel welcomed! We've gotten our food quick whether we were with a party of 2 or a party of 10!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant, saved our New Year's Eve when Cenacolo's cared less (please read my review on them and consider against patronizing).  Get the Chicago style pizza. Definitely not Chicago style, however, amazing pizza non the less. Great respectful courteous wait staff. Ambiance was relaxed and prices were great!"}
{"text":"Lucci's is my fave PGH pizza - the crust is chewy and delicious.  If you've never been, you really ought to give it a try.  It's a fairly thin crust in the middle, but the edges are thicker and more toothsome.   

My only reason for not giving a higher score is that their staff aren't overly friendly."}
{"text":"My parents absolutely love this place.  Anytime we have relatives that come in from out of town, we always find ourselves going to Luccis.  In my opinion though, it is just okay.

There is nothing really that amazing about the food.  Everyone seems to go there for the Spaghetti Special, and everybody likes their pizza.  Their actual entrees are good and definitely leave you full, but I would rather travel a few more miles to get some better food.  However, because of the convenience, it makes it a nice place for my family and I. 

Additionally, there is a waitress there with the worst attitude ever.  She waited on us this past weekend and was constantly huffing and puffing and rolling her eyes.  Also, she needs to learn proper English: \"Do you not want no more\" is not how you talk to guest nor how you talk in general.  Go back to elementary school."}
{"text":"I used to love this place until tonight. I walked in there at 806pm. The sign on the door says they close at 9. There was 8 of us total. We told the hostess how many people we had and she literally said \"let me see. I think everyone wants to go home.\" She talked to a server who said \"I dunno, let me see is someone wants it.\" Someone wants it?????? Guess I will be taking my business elsewhere from both of your locations and I would suggest others do to. Today was my wife's baby shower and we wanted to cap a perfect day off with a nice dinner. Luckily we were able to find an establishment that was willing to take our $278 order!"}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've been to Lucci's...and I returned there yesterday for lunch with a couple folks as we were in the area. We walked in just as they were opening and were met by a pleasant young lady who seated us immediately. Turns out it was her first day there. Score one for good training, because she did a great job! From the soups, to my steak salad, the small pizza and chicken and fries, everything was right and delicious around the table. Cups were refilled quickly, and we were checked on regularly.
Well done... we'll be back again doon."}
{"text":"WE probably spend at least $200 a month ordering from this place eating there and delivery,  most of the time when they deliver there is no reciept , we just ordered today for a delivery, and we ordered extra sauce, well, once the stuff arrived, i checked out hte bill, and they charged us $2.70 for about 3 table spoons of extra sauce, ontop of that there was hardly any sauce on the pasta at all, and they charged us a $1.75 delivery fee, but wait, the kicker is that they taxed the delivery fee, this place has gone down hill big time,  i asked them if they would put extra sauce on the pasta and also on the side, and they told me they only give extra sauce on the side, well that is fine, but for crying out loud where is the sauce that is suppose to go on the pasta, they have gotten very cheap with there food, i got shimp alfredo and it was watery , and the hardly any sauce on it either, for the price they charge for there food, and for what you get its a total rip off, we decided we will not be giving them anymore of our hard earned money, they are only like 4 miles down the road from us and the last 6 ftimes we have had it delivered its always cold and we have to re- heat it every time, oh i forgot to mention we always give the driver a really good tip also, but the food is still cold when it gets here, as we are very nice and generous but enough is enough, how can you justify taxing the delivery fee, thats plan crazy, also how can you live with your self charging $2.70 for 3 table spoons of sauce, never, ever again will we eat at this place, they just lost valuble customers..........and i am sure they dont care,"}
{"text":"We've had the chicken wings, chicken parm (comes with spaghetti, salad, and bread), pizza, and meatball sub. They are all \"okay\". Plus, we think their prices are a bit high for what you get.

Just because they serve things other than pizza, do not mistake them for an Italian joint. Everything except the pizza tastes and likely is industrial food. I saw them take the salad dressing out of a mass-produced tub and the salad out of a \"Fresh Express\" bag. I'm assuming that the chicken parm and the wings came from matching frozen bags. I should have purchased some bags of my own and assembled everything at home. Sure, since I don't own a deep fryer, the chicken items wouldn't have that greasy, fried taste, but I would have saved the calories and the money. Also, the sub is mostly bread, and their bread is not good. Italian joints should not screw up bread.

Good things: we have always dined in, and the employees are nice. The restaurant and the kitchen are clean."}
{"text":"I've ordered their pizza based on yelpers' review... Meh... I didn't want it after a bite."}
{"text":"Gluten Free pizza!!!!! You can do traditional red sauce, or a specialty. Last week I ordered a white pizza with tomatoes and it was great. The crusts are made by Gluuteny, a near-by gluten free and dairy free bakery. Lucci's delivers all the way to Regent Square also! I wouldn't recommend this for those with Celiac's because of potential cross contamination, but those with an intolerance it's exceptional. Yes, it's just pizza, but after years of missing out on greasy pizza, this is just great!"}
