{"text":"Went to your north Olmsted location very impressed with the staff and food !!!! My new favorite place :))))"}
{"text":"We were traveling, looking for a place to stop and get salads; they have several interesting salad choices, and the roll that was served with the salad was SO GOOD!  They said they make the rolls on site using their pizza dough. (Kind of disappointed - I was hoping that they were from some company that I could get at home!)"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and nice atmosphere! A great place to visit with friends for a simple meal and definitely one of the better casual restaurant choices in Rocky River. Breadsticks are great. Danny Boy's has a nice, warm neighborhood feel."}
{"text":"Deep dish --
More like shallow dish! I made my way to Danny Boy's seeking some solid deep dish pizza. The service was satisfactory, but the pizza, on the other hand, was less than decent. The bottom crust of the pizza was very thin and half of it tasted rather crusty and dry. The main crust was delicious, but the inside was somewhat underdone and doughy. I guess that's what you could expect when it only took 20 minutes to cook!! Overall the pizza was okay. Would probably eat again."}
{"text":"This review is for pizza delivered to Lakewood West End from this location.  If/when I eat in the restaurant I will update the review.  Although there are like 1,000,000 restaurants to try in this area, this place has a cute Sinatra/ Rat Pack theme and I love Frank and his gang, so there's a good chance I will stop in at some point. 

Re pizza: the customer service both from the guy on the phone and the guy dropping off the 'za was top notch and deserves 5 stars.  I'm used to pizza places, especially on busy weekend nights, (a) putting me on hold for many minutes when I call in a pizza order, (b) having someone who is about 15 years old and on their first job bumbling around taking my order, and (c) delivering or  providing for takeout a lukewarm rather than hot pizza.  Danny Boy's did none of the above. The staff I interacted with had been SUPER well trained and the pizza arrived so hot I could feel it through the box.  And yes, they did get it to Lakewood in well under the quoted 45 minutes delivery time, yay! 

Unfortunately the pizza itself was more of a three-star eating experience.  This likely has to do with my personal taste in pies.  I am not turned on by the idea of mac n' cheese on a pizza, or anything weird like that - I am more into just having a normal old pizza with cheese, pepperoni, etc. cooked in such a manner that the crust and toppings form a unified, greasy whole. Danny Boy's regular pizza is more along the lines of a soft fluffy crust with toppings sitting on top of it, so that when you eat it, the hunk of cheese and toppings pulls away from the crust.  In my experience, places that specialize in Chicago-style pizza tend to make their pizzas in this manner, even when you don't order Chicago-style (as I didn't), and some people really like the toppings-sitting-on-fluffy-crust concept and some like me do not (which explains the wide differences in pizza ratings).   I will say that in addition to arriving hot, the crust was really fresh, tasty, cooked through and crusty at the edges, and I liked that the sauce wasn't super-sweet (nice change from Angelo's sugary sauce) but mushrooms are to be avoided here because they seem to be using a canned/ marinated variety that doesn't have much taste or freshness. 

So, 3 stars for pie and 5 stars for service adds up to 4 stars.  I would give this place another try and go for the thin crust next time."}
{"text":"Now, here's a pizza I can get behind.

I've been struggling to find a good pizza in the Lakewood area, but I need look no further!  D Boy's Spicy White Pie is outta this world good.  Plus the crust is one of the better ones I've had...maybe ever.  

I've only done delivery and I've really got to get my butt over to Rocky River and try this place in person."}
{"text":"Usually a reliable, although pricier meal, Danny Boys disappointed in take out this time.  None of the items were exceptional but most annoying was the portions/price. I can accept an off night for anyone but there are so many competing in this spot that I don't have to run back any time soon."}
{"text":"I've lived in Cleveland for over 6 years and I just had Danny Boys for the first time last night. I know, I know....I need to come out of my bubble. It definitely lived up to its hype. We ordered the Hawaiian pizza (pineapple, ham, green olives) and it was amazing. I wasn't sure if I was going to like the green olives since I'm not a HUGE fan of green olives except for in my martinis. But they were spot on. I also liked that the breadsticks were actually larger than a slice of pizza. 

Glad I finally got around to trying Danny Boys."}
{"text":"This location is not accessible for wheelchair users. There are stairs to the main dinning area."}
{"text":"I don't get how anyone could eat at Poopa Johns or Pizza Butt when you have local gems like Danny Boys...

Every one is raving about the pizzas, fold overs, sandwiches, Woogie bears, and calzones...and rightfully so!  They are all outstanding!

But I was in one night for dinner with friends (who drove in from Savannah, GA and stopped there before they went to see the in-laws!) and I just didn't feel like pizza.  I wanted something new.  So I tried the ribs and was SHOCKED at how tasty they were!  Smokey, fall-off-the-bone tender, sweet, zesty sauce, served with a side of their french fries.  It was really great!

The waitresses are always on the ball, and my glass is never empty...a big thumbs up in my book.  I wish they had more seating, but, in some ways, I think that making it bigger would somehow ruin it.  

I rated this as \"not good for kids\" simply based on the size.  If you're on of those parents who feel that it's OK to let your kids run around a restaurant, please...do us all a favor and go to Suck-e-Cheese.  

Love this place!"}
{"text":"ummm.. the smell when you walk in is the best.. sometimes i wish i worked in the pizza kitchen.  the menu is huge and the portions are even bigger.. i have seen sandwiches there that are like telephone poles!  
aside from all of the frank sinatra nonesense, this is the perfect date place.  my compliments to whomever keeps up with the dough recipe, it is consistantly great!  i order woogie bears all the time and they are just as good warmed up and eaten later on. make sure that you get breadsticks with whatever you get.  -ummm buttery!
and i think i have a crush on the guy slinging the pies in the back too, he has the coolest mustache in town!"}
{"text":"Oh, I have missed you Danny Boy!  I used to live within a couple miles of Danny Boys and delivered to my place all of the time.  Well, back to the current day.

This is the type of place you want to take someone from out of town, since it is THE Rocky River landmark.  On a Friday or Saturday night, the line is out the door.  Play a few rounds of checkers while you wait...the boards are waiting for you.

The dining room (?) is small, with plastic checkered table clothes.  A few TVs are in the upper corner to entertain those who are bored with the conversation.  They serve beer and wine and cater to families in a relaxed atmospher.  Don't expect to have a quiet interlude here because it's just not going to happen.  

The decor is filled with Rat Pack and the dishes are named for them too.  One of my faves is the Perfectly Frank Fettucini.  It's a delicious mess of Italian Sausage, Chicken, bell peppers in a garlic cream sauce with rosemary.   This is served with a huge house salad and loads of Woogie Bears, the house roll (made with Ricotta).  It's a smart thing to share an entree or plan to take lots of food home with you.  

My favorite Pizza is the Spicy White, with diced pepperoni and banana peppers and served with a light garlicy white sauce.  When I die, I want a Spicy White on my tombstone.  This one is killer good.  The crust is brushed with olive oil and I think there is ricotta stuffed inside.  

Parking is always a challenge and usually is behind Rego's Market, but it doesn't stop the crowds.  You just can't get any better Pizza on the West Side and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"Mac 'n' cheese pizza - all I have to say. Amazing. Get it. Sounds over the top, and it is, and it's the best. We mostly do takeout/delivery.

Also, great customer service. We order almost every weekend from here (sad), and the few random times that they are running late, the driver has called to inform us, AND brought free pop and/or breadsticks (which are to die for). Who does that anymore?!"}
{"text":"You won't find better people and/or better food on the west side of Cleveland!  Been going here since high school and their people and pizza are simply the best!!"}
{"text":"Its good pizza, but also some of the most expensive in all of Cuyahoga County. I doubt I will pay $28 for a pie again there anytime soon. This aint downtown Chicago or New York city. Just sayin!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love This Danny Boy's. It is definitely our favorite pizza around. The service is great too. We always get the deluxe pizza and it is delicious. Today we tried the cheese garlic bread and it was delicious as well."}
{"text":"Having been to Danny Boy's several times in the past (although it has been a couple years since the last visit), we decided to get dinner from there last night. Ordered a large New York style thin crust, a medium Chicago style deep dish and an order of breadsticks w/ Alfredo - total cost $45.99. If the pizza was really good like Giordano's in Chitown, or ANY of the hundreds of great pizza places in the NYC area the cost would have been justified and this review would look much different. The thin crust pizza looked very appealing appearance wise, but ended up being somewhat thicker than a traditional NYC pie, and thus not really crispy on the bottom. Sauce and cheese and topping went well together, but the soggy, doughy crust left much to be desired. The Chicago Pie suffered from the same fate. A very soggy and seemingly undercooked crust on the bottom, really took away from the sausage filling which had a nice flavor with a bit of heat (the sausage would be better in smaller flatter pieces inside instead of the one huge patty on bottom of pie - easier to manage) and the cheese and sauce. Also this is only about half as thick as an actual deep dish pie from Lou Malnati's or Giordano's. Breadsticks are not only huge, but very tasty - the Alfredo was ok, albeit slightly darker than most, but nothing really to rave about...had a slightly funny taste I couldn't quite put my finger on. Could have been really good - but just ended up being ok."}
{"text":"I had heard about it and finally went today. It was delicious.  I'll be going back to it. I had the new jersey sandwich and my compadre had the 10 hot wings. We both liked it."}
{"text":"I have dined in twice and ordered take out many times. I am never disappointed. Italian themed restaurant and food. Best pizza in the area. My favorite pizza do far would be the Mac n Cheese with kettle chips, add chicken and bacon for an even better taste (if you are a meat eater)."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and the chili was awake so hearty and filling but today I got the pizza slice and salad lunch special and it was burnt and definitely not a New York style slice it looked like a regular cheese pizza slice it was super thick and barley had sauce on it,  I specifically asked for  cheddar cheese on my salad and extra croutons which I got non of but because the order taker was rushing my my order was wrong. I didn't think this meal was work 10 dollars at all I've paid less for better food and service I will never be returning and it's sad because I like supporting local businesses but what I won't tolerate is poor quality of food and crappy customer service. When I called in about the order being incorrect the girl was more focused on who did it rather then fixing the issue. Just a waste of my time and money."}
{"text":"my husband and I like Danny Boy's deep dish pizza and on our last time dining in we ordered something new. I got a pepperoni & cheese calzone (more food on my plate for one) and my husband got his own small deep dish with green olives and jalapenos. We both had left overs. We always split a house salad too b/c it is more salad than a single person could eat, well if you plan on eating pizza too ;) the salad comes with two of their yummy bread sticks too...always chewy and fresh!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here for my birthday dinner and it was good. We started with a house salad which was decent size because we were able to split it. I got the champagne viniagrette and it was absolutely delicious. I mean good to the point I wanted to drink it. If you get a salad definitely get that dressing. The salad also came with a breadstick that was very good. If I knew the breadsticks were that good we have gotten those instead of the cheesy garlic bread which was good too but not nearly as good as the bread stick. We got a pizza called the thin white duke which had red peppers, spinach, artichokes and a creamy parmesan sauce. I would definitely order that again as it was a good size and good price. The only complaints I can say I had was when you walk in there is no sign or anything letting you know to seat yourself. Second, the red sauce that came with our garlic bread actually tasted like prego spaghetti sauce. Other than those 2 things I would come back here to try more."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible pizza. Don't waste your money. The toppings tasted like they were prepared the week before and were dry and tasteless. I hate even giving this place one star...go someplace else."}
{"text":"i don't know about their pizza, but years ago i had a bbq sandwich that had slaw and potato chips right on top of it.  i'm sure it was danny boy's, but i don't see it on the online menu.   

my arteries may still be clogged from that big honkin' thing, but my tastebuds still remember the delicious explosion of flavor...

...in my mouth.

five stars based on memory, though i haven't been back since moving back to clevo.  judging by the other reviews, seems to me they're still crankin' out more flavor for your buck.

think of it as a recession special.  most places don't give you that much deliciousness.  danny boy's gives you extra for the same amount of dough you'd spend anywhere else.

oooh! play on words!! pizza! dough!!  i'm clever!! ooh!!!

ok, i'm done."}
{"text":"I won a free gift card for here at a raffle, so I figured - what can I have to lose? Me and my boyfriend went during a weeknight, and we were not disappointed. Our waitress was extremely good - very attentive and nice. It was not too crowded, but enough people there to not make you second guess whether the place is actually good or not. We ordered the Chicago-style deep dish pizza, and it was to die for. Danny Boy's earned another 2 loyal customers that night! (Oh, plus they have an extensive menu of good pizzas - can't wait to go back and try another one off the menu!)"}
{"text":"Prices are extremely reasonable.  The servings are huge and I take home half of it.  So, I get two meals!  I love their pizza crust!  YUMMMMM!  Their house wine is a good value, priced at $5 per glass.  Nice selection of beer.  Delicious breadsticks.  

I like it!"}
{"text":"Extremely good pizza. Not as great as Angelo's, in my opinion (although two things might have thrown off my comparison: 1- we did takeout, not dine-in, thus perhaps allowing the pizza to get a tad soggy on its way to us; and 2- we did the \"NY style\" thin crust instead of the deep-dish like at Angelo's, and therefore, it's sort of like comparing apples to oranges).

Our group ordered two pizzas; one half plain, half black olive, and one bbq chicken. I didn't try the bbq chicken last night, BUT I was gifted three leftover slices of it from our very gracious hosts, so I will try it today. I love me some pizza leftovers!

I want to try going to the restaurant, because I think from reading the other reviews, I would like the atmosphere.

Not sure I'd say that the NY style crust matches that of NY pizza in the least....but it was a good effort and still tasted good.

Oh, and my husband ordered some delicious fiery wings that were made with a dry rub and made his nose run. Good times!"}
{"text":"I like this place, the pizza is pretty good, the breadsticks are awesome fluffy goodness, i still have yet to try a pasta dish but I'm sure its good. The place is always busy every time i go and the staff is very friendly. Alittle pricey but you do get good portions.

Ive tried the chicago deep dish, it was ok. Ive had real deep dish in chicago that was way better. Also tried the NY style thin and it was just a regual thin crust pizza not even close to real ny style but it was good."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Cleveland. The wait can be pretty long some nights if you're trying to eat there for dinner, but it's just as good picking one up to go. I usually stick to pretty basic pizzas and breadsticks, so I can't speak for much beyond those."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try this when going through Cleveland on a trip and waited 20 mins to sit before trying the food. It is a nice casual place with a large menu, we tried breadsticks, regular pizza, tony soprano, and a clevelander pizza. The breadsticks and regular pizza were good. The tony soprano was unique with the pasta on he sandwich and the spaghetti was quite tasty, but the all-star was the clevelander. This is all the benefits of a Chicago style pizza without all the extra crust. I am sorry for the lack of picture but if you like Chicago style you will love this pie. It is a unique pizza that I have not had Berger and find myself craving it now a few days afterward. This is a great pizza place to go better than any pizza in little Italy."}
{"text":"4 stars for the nostalgic interior, 3 stars for the food.  This place is a throwback to old school heroes, which makes the place cool as hell and very comfortable.  We decided to order french fries as an appetizer and a deep dish pepperoni pizza as our main.  There was nothing out-of-this-world about plain french fries (but we know this).  When the pizza arrived, I was so disappointed.  I guess I am a deep dish pizza snob having previously lived in Chicago, but what really bothered me was the dough wasn't cooked all the way through.  It was still raw.  I should have known that when I saw the watery substance laying in the pan before I cut into it with a knife.  Perhaps Danny Boy's was having an off night, but I don't think it excuses an undercooked pizza.  I still think Angelo's and Sainato's both make a way better pizza!"}
{"text":"After a horrible experience at a different restaurant, my party ended up here.  The pizza was good.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  Its not very big, and we sat outside on the tiny patio on the sidewalk.  The waitress was friendly too.  I'll go be going back to try more of their offerings."}
{"text":"Danny Boy's is pretty awesome for the simple fact that I love the old school feel of the place. We went on a Thursday night and there was only a few other families there. We got our food really fast and it was delicious! We had to have the bread sticks because of all of the yelp reviews and I'm glad we did! They were amazing!!! We played cards that they have at each table until our pizzas arrived. I got the chicago deep dish and it was perfect (even better the next day warmed up in the oven!) They're definitely on the pricey side but what pizza place isn't these days? I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great pizza and everything in-between!  One of the few pizza places that puts Ricotta cheese on some of their pizzas. California Dreaming is a great veggie pizza and one of my favorites. Great variety and unique choices of pizzas, subs, pasta, appetizers, etc. Rat Pack Pizzas, Woogie Bears, salads and soups are all delicious. They even have tortilla pizzas. The bread rolls are addictive carbs. Huge...and I mean HUGE portions.  Friendly and very efficient staff.  We have been going here for a very long time and whenever I take people here for the first time, they love it.   My only complaint is not enough Dino on the walls ;)"}
{"text":"Nice place with a good Pizzeria feel on the inside.  They put a deck of cards on all the tables and have some checker/chess tables available.  Good outdoor seating, especially this time of the year. 

Their menu selection is pretty large. On this inaugural visit, we have the bread sticks and a Chicago pizza.  I spent quite some time in Chicago proper and hit all of the joints, so I was interested to see how it stood up.

So let us start with the Bread Sticks.  They are really well done and piled high.  They come out hot with a dish of marinara.  The sticks themselves are fantastic, hot, and soft in the inside and just a light brown crust.  The sauce needs a little doctoring though.  But it is not bad.

The Pizza.  So they do the full on sausage bottom like Gino's East.  Only problem is that they put the sausage at the top.  Gino's places it at the bottom.  This makes for a better experience.  With it on top, when you bite or cut in, it pushes everything out the side.  Aside from that, it is pretty good for being outside of Chicago.

We were impressed enough that we will go back, but next time it is for the Clevelander."}
{"text":"This is some awesome pizza. Most recently I got the Cleveland Pizza, which is a combo of New York style and Chicago style pizza. It was really tasty (even my cold leftovers for breakfast the next day). The breadsticks are also the best around. They're like a fluffy combination of croissants and dinner rolls and if I could have it my way, these are the only breadsticks I'd have for the rest of time!

Its a small little place with interesting things on the walls and it smells incredible the second you walk in! My favorite West Side pizza, hands down!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in the Cleveland area. So far my favorite pizza is the Mac n Cheese Pizza; it's awesome. The breadsticks and bruschetta are very good as well. Their fold overs and sandwiches are always good as well. You can't go wrong here. 

The location in Rocky River is the best but Broadview and Sandusky are larger."}
{"text":"Ate at Danny Boys last night and didn't have a great meal which is disappointing. I have been to Danny Boys in the past but haven't eaten there recently. Last night I ordered the choose your own pasta option. I ordered spaghetti with marinara sauce and a meatball. The waitress told me the meatballs were large and one would be plenty so I ordered one. 

The food arrived and it wasn't great for multiple reasons. 1. The portion was absolutely massive. Seriously enough to feed four people. 2.  The pasta was drowning in watery sauce. 3.  The marinara sauce wasn't flavorful. 4. The meatball was not large. I ended up ordering a second one. 

I'm hoping the restaurant can take this as constructive criticism and make some improvements. You may think I'm nit picking the food, but I was thinking all of the above things while eating the meal last night. The person I ate with ordered a different pasta and also didn't enjoy their meal.

Edited to add: Thank you Renee for your response. I appreciate it."}
{"text":"we tried the original Danny Boy's Pizza in Rocky River Friday and found it to be nearly as good as our experience in Broadview Heights a couple months ago.
we weren't aware that it was a \"seat yourself\" environment so we stood there looking like morons for a few minutes till a server saw us and let us know to pick our own table. a sign or something would have been nice but no big deal. 
once seated we ordered our meals. i got a pizza w/ pepperoni, yellow banana peppers and onion. i also ordered a cup of chili and tried on of their meatballs. i think i've found a meatball that i like as good as Antonio's in Parma - maybe even more. it was really very good. 
the chili was ok. the veggies weren't cooked as much as i like, but the taste was good, if not a little spicy. 
my pizza was great but i was already almost full by the time it arrived so i took most of it home to enjoy as lunch the next day. 
Danielle had a New Jersey Chicken Melt with chicken, pepperoni, tomatoes, basil, banana peppers, romano cheese, pizza cheese, italian dressing and a side of pizza sauce.  it's all sealed and baked into pizza dough like a calzone. i tried it and thought it was delicious.
it's a little farther away than the Broadview Heights location so I'm not sure when we'll be back, but if you're in the area you should try it for some of the best pizza around."}
{"text":"First time tonight and couldn't have been a more horrible experience. Waited to get served. Soup was ice cold and the service was so poor I had to take the soup up to the kitchen myself. I guess my waving to a waitress for help was missed by the three I waved to. I love small business but come on guys wake up! You will be like the place next door to you that says for rent if you don't look after your customer . Food was ok. Unfortunately I will not return and try some other place."}
{"text":"I ordered a large pepperoni pizza and a quesadilla looking thing for $30.what I got was paper thin pizza and whatever the he'll the other thing was,all I can say is it was the worst pizza that i have had in a long time.I didn't even eat the other thing, I should have just flushed $30 down the toilet,and got a Little Caesars  $5 hot n ready instead.Never Again will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I will definitely be trying more items from this menu after my first experience here! 

I got delivery so I can't speak on the restaurant itself but I can say that delivery time was much faster than expected. We were quoted 45 minutes to an hour and it arrived after 30 minutes! I live in Lakewood so that was pretty excellent! 

I got a sandwich calzone hybrid kind of thing. It was good but not amazing. I really want to try the pizza next because i know that's what they brag about. Overall, seems to be good quality food. Pizza prices seem steep but may be worth it. The sandwiches were worth the price, for sure."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town, dough is fresh and the selection is great.  The steak and french fry pizza is my favorite.  Oh and the rest of the menu is extremely good.  The place itself is small but the feel of it is great.  The staff has always been very friendly even when I bring my son.  And yes, for the pizza snobs out there, I have lived in Chicago and this does measure up!"}
{"text":"The best local pizza, if you like deep dish.  Period.  Seriously, this pizza's so thick you could run it for President.  You can't eat this with your teeth; you have to cut it with a knife, because my God!  It's a frickin' slab of cheese, delicious tomatoes, real bacon, and other heart-stoppers.  

The local saying is that \"Frankie Loves Carbs,\" and the restaurant's obsessed with Frank Sinatra.  It's kind of adorable.  Also, unlike most of the local pizza joints, Danny Boys does other kinds of Italian well, so if you're not in the mood for 'za you can get other things that are just as good.  Plus, the waitstaff's always been unflaggingly attentive.  Recommended highly."}
{"text":"What a great place! The staff was great and the food was excellent. Try the spinach dip pizza...sounds weird right? But it was delicious!! I can't wait to go back and try the other dishes. It's better if you bring a small group of people. The portions are huge so if everyone gets something, you can all try some. Very few people left without a to-go leftover box."}
{"text":"Let me ask, have you ever had a woogie from Danny Boys? No? Then get your butt into one of their locations and get one! Wednesday is woogie night, 7.99 for one. They are just the right size to order one and done. The woogie is similar to a calzone but better. Why? Hmmmm, I don't know it just is! Pizza sauce comes on the side for dipping, and that's almost too much goodness right there!!! 
Their pizza is good too, but for myself and the many others I have spoken to about Danny Boys, the Woogies are where it's at. Oh, and frank Sinatra too!"}
{"text":"Simply the best pizza on the West side.  Deep dish goodness with any toppings you can imagine.  They even have a mac & cheese pizza for heaven's sake!  I mean, they combined two of the best comfort foods into one.  Genius.  Once upon a time they also had a potato skin pizza that was exactly what it sounded like, a deep dish pizza crust filled with mashed potato, cheese and bacon.  A Carb lovers fantasy.  God I love carbs.  Its no longer on the menu (sob) but they do have a new pierogie pie I have been dying to try.  No matter what you order, you just can't go wrong.  Salads, calzones, subs, ect.  I could go on and on.  My favorite thing to do is split a salad and pizza with my dinner companion. 
The one con, if you can call it that, is that the restaurant is small and often packed.  Expect a wait if you attempt to go right at dinner time or on the weekends. But I promise you, its worth the wait :-)"}
{"text":"So, after watching Venus pass over the surface of the Sun, I thought \"Hey, let's go to someplace we haven't been in awhile...\" and thus, we came to Danny Boy's, a very interesting place.

The theme of this place is a study in odd combos and contrasts. 

See, the thing about Danny Boy's Pizza is, it isn't JUST pizza. Now the pizza is GREAT, but so are the sandwiches, the amazing bread...pillows (they ain't sticks folks, more like pillows of doughy, tasty goodness with sauce and cheese,) and other items you can buy...like the Woogie. A \"Woogie\" is like a stromboli with attitude; they have BBQ beef brisket, Veggie and Buffalo; yeah, they're awesome. 

Also,you'd think with a name like Danny Boys, the place was Irish...

No. 

The place is as Italian as you can get...and has more Frank Sinatra decor than you'll see anywhere...including Frank's home. Add to that the fine staff, the nice atmosphere and the food that will kick your butt, and you've got a winning combo that you'll keep coming back to. 

BTW, if you get a chance, try my favorite sammich, the \"Elliot Laudermilk\", Grilled chicken, melted cheese and BBQ sauce over kettle-cooked chips on a toasted roll..covered in coleslaw:) 

Now, the place isn't huge, at least not the River location, but they've branched out to half-a-dozen more spots in the area, so give them a try, and if you're a Sinatra fan, make sure that you ask to have it your way...cause they'll be very accommodating."}
{"text":"Holy spectacular. This pizza is incredible!! I ordered the double crust gangster, California, and bread sticks. My mouth has never been so happy. This is my first of many trips to Danny Boys! The girl answering the phone, and the driver were both very friendly. But the pizza is AMAZINGGGGGG!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance:  4.  If you tell me you don't like Frank Sinatra, you're lying. One can't really dream up a narrow restaurant with stacked tomato sauce cans and random Frank memorabilia as good as this place.  Props also to them for having chess and checkers at a small tables while you're waiting to sit down.  Only dink here is I wish they had a patio off the side for summer.

Cost:  4. You're generally paying quite a pretty penny for some of the pizza's, but rightfully so in my opinion.  You're paying a premium for an absurd food portion, which is fine if you plan to take home some leftovers.

Food Quality: 5. One can argue back and forth with friends on what constitutes great pizza, but it doesn't matter at Danny Boy's.  The clincher for me and why this is my first 5-star review is that they offer a wide range of pizza's: Deep Dish look alikes, crazy pizzas (mac-n-cheese, etc), thin crust appetizer pizzas, or in other words anything someone can dream up.  Also, the remainder of the menu from massive sandwiches to pastas is not too shabby either.  After trying at least a dozen items in total at Danny Boy's now I have yet to have something I would not order again.  

Service: 5. Busy or empty, service has always been great.  They do a good job of turning tables over quickly for such a small restaurant, but without making you feel rushed. 

When to return:  A great place for a date, duh.  Also despite Sinatra/Dean theme, no risk of having to sing karaoke which is also a plus.  Not-so-obvious is that it's a great place to go with friends or family who like large portions, a great alternative to a Maggiano's or Buca-di-Beppo."}
{"text":"Great food! Fun environment. My family and I love using the playing cards that are at the table during our meal."}
{"text":"Just walked out the door. After being told to sit wherever we liked, we sat for 20 minutes with no service, no drink order, no menu, nothing. The place was empty. Waitresses for cleaning tables, but continued to walk straight past us. We finally got up to leave and a staff member said, \"Thank you, have a great night.\" Perhaps it's a good idea to start hiring staff older than 15 years of age who have a clue about customer service. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating at Danny boys and always recommend it. Their pizza is excellent and normally the food is great. Their bread is very good as well as their sauce. Recently however my mouth watered as I waited for my broken lasagna dish. Not only was I disappointed to learn it is a penne noodle dish (with red peppers and some cheese on top), it also had no traits or flavors of anything resembling a lasagna dish (regatta cheese tomato, sausage etc) I will most likely go back again when I am over this disappointment however I would not recommend this dish to anyone."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in the Cleveland area. I have tried pizza from all over the area, and I think this is definitely the best. The location is small if you are planning on dining in, but for pickup the place is awesome. If you get a salad, it also comes with bread, which is just amazing (I don't recommend the cheesy bread though - normal is fine with me)."}
{"text":"Continuing on my \"Quest for the best Pizza in the City\" Danny Boys was mentioned by my fabulous neighbors.  They even treated me to the great pie!  I heart my neighbors!

You may be questioning my four stars.
I blame it on the lack of beer on a Sunday.
\"What?\" you say, \"No beer with your pizza?!\". 
That's right; Danny Boys had no beer on Sunday.  
This is probably the only downfall I can express about Danny Boys.  (And it isn't actually their fault, from my understanding).  

That being said, be prepared to sneak you flask in if you go on a Sunday wanting Pizza & Beer.  Either that, or get it to go.

The \"standard\" pizza was ordered, and the Chicago style.  The \"standard\" must be ordered otherwise the playing field would not be even.  You may ask what the \"standard\" is.  Allow me to explain.
\"Standard Pizza\"
1. Garlic
2. Pepperoni
3. Extra Cheese.

The pie was excellente!  Oh my!  The crust was perfecto, the cheese was gooey, the sauce yummy, and the pepperonis plentiful.  I was in \"Standard\" Heaven.  (I think I'm salivating as I type.)  The Chicago style, a unique pizza, which we are lead to believe is something you would find in Chicago (although having lived there and eaten more than my share of pizza, never have I seen or eaten one like this).  It is a deeper pie with a ginormous sausage patty under a layer of cheese & sauce.  Yes, I did say patty.  It was a favorite with the boys.  Although quite good, I preferred the other.

The server was helpful.  The ambiance is cute with its Rat Pack theme.  On several occasions between chewing I belted out a tune with Frank.

Two things that would make Danny Boys off the charts, 
1. Beer on Sunday
2. Frank Sinatra Karaoke.

Sigh....I guess you can't have it all.....

Danny Boys rocked it out!  
Good work kids!"}
{"text":"Sat down at Danny Boy's for some pizza pie yesterday with my boyfriend. I had the Chicago and he got the BBQ Chicken Pie. I was in the mood for some deep dish but I will admit the BBQ pizza was better. All around the pizza and service was very good. The only caveat was the deck of cards provided at the table, it was missing cards and had like 6 Aces. Thanks to this cheating lying deck I lost in a game of rummy to my bf. Butttt I supposed I am just a sore loser. Again, delicious food great service."}
{"text":"This is an updated review as my last experience with danny boys was sub par, this most recent one was excellent. I am not sure what happened last time , but maybe it was just too busy at the holidays to watch each order that went out and ensure it was well done. In any event, rob at danny boys helped us out after learning of our recent disappointment in our order. He set us up and basically replaced it ( were able to use it at a later date). We got a cheeseburger in paradise calzone, created a pasta and a chicken salad.  Each one was fantastic. Calzone was perfectly stuffed, bread was crisp and not soggy and overall taste was great. Pasta was perfect with meatballs being huge and tasty and the tomato basil cream sauce was seasoned perfectly. Salad was fresh, chicken was grilled perfectly. Delievery was quoted anf an hour and arrived within that time. Excellent food this time around and helped restore our orginally good feelings towards danny boys. Thanks danny boys. We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying Danny Boys Pizza since late 90s when I lived in Cleveland area.  Get here early!  Waits can be long.  Great pizza, great bread sticks and the nice thing is that it isn't another chain."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland for business, I stumpled upon Danny Boys around lunch time. What a delight. It was mid week and on the late side for lunch but it was easy to picture the place packed with locals enjoying some pizza and beers after a softball game or something. Danny Boys paints a very nice picture of the town. Great food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm basing this review off a delivery, so I promise to eat in, and update. I ordered the \"Chicago\", which is their version of a Chicago deep dish pizza. While it was OK, it certainly was not close to its namesake 

It was OK. Nothing stellar. I promise to give this place additional chances, and report back. 

BTW, the bread sticks I've heard so much about...meh. 

Disappointed, as we live down the hill on the river. We can almost throw a baseball to this place."}
{"text":"Could not have been more pleased. Our server Jordan was great. Food was awesome and it came out so quick!  I ate till I was full and then some and I still had a ton to bring home!!! I will absolutely be back soon! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Danny Boys for roughly around 7 years. I have yet to have on bad experience at this join. The service is fantastic for dining as it is for take out also. The Bread sticks could feed a whole family as the portions are huge. The pizza's are out of this world due to great sauce. Great place for a date or a casual meal."}
{"text":"It was pretty good pizza and breadsticks. Staff was friendly and all. But really there's other places where is rather go or a pie. That have better pizza and ambiance."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm good ! This was my first time at this wonderful place where everything I ordered was delicious. My husband and I have found a new date night spot ! We ordered the half slab ribs with bake bean coke slaw garlic jojo and the dinner roll OMG the bomb!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm an idiot. I think my old review proves that. Danny Boy's is great and now with their new location in North Olmsted it's my go to pizza place. The sauce is the best. the only think I have had that i didn't love was the pizza with angel hair pasta on it. But peas on pizza is weird, so i knew what i was getting into. Want pizza? go here."}
{"text":"I remember when I was a kid, sitting in my dad's car next to Convenient at Detroit and Lewis and spying Danny Boys Pizza. I begged him to get me a pizza, and we did, deciding on sausage as our topping of choice. \"Other people can eat pepperoni, but real men eat sausage,\" my six year-old said as he stifled a laugh. I still remember the taste of that first bite, the aroma of the cheese and herbs and tomatoes, the smile that crept onto my lips.

Twenty-two years later, I saw the same look in my son's eye as he had his first taste of Danny Boys. He looked at me and said \"Us men, we eat pepperoni, right Dad?\" I stifled a laugh, just as my father had before me.

Personal anecdote aside, I'm deeply in love with this pizza, with this place. Maybe it's nostalgia, though people we've introduced Danny Boys to feel the same way we do: That this is, quite possibly, one of the most perfect pizzas ever.

The crust is thin, and still retains some chewiness. There's some dough to it, making it something your mother would probably want you to eat with a knife and fork. And then, there's the Crust, the part you hold and stare at fondly. It's the last piece I eat, and for good reason: It's the best part of a pizza, your mouth already inundated with cheese and spice. It helps clean your teeth of little bits that shouldn't be there. It's truly the Italian Toothbrush.

The sausage is amazing, too. A sweet, zesty Italian so good that it's at home both on top their regular pie, as well as their Chicago Style crust which is -- dare I say -- better than any other Chicago Style pizza I've ever had. 

Don't like pizza? Fine. Eat the pasta. The homemade sauces are straight out of an Italian grandmother's kitchen. You'll feel your cheeks being pinched, and an older woman telling you \"You-a don't eat-a enough. Come. I-a feed you!\" with a smile on her face. The sandwiches are good, too. So are the fold-overs. So is the Woogie Bear.

Just stop reading and go to Danny Boys. You won't be sorry. Just be prepared to wait. The dining room is small. Or, do what I do: Delivery."}
{"text":"The highlight of our meal wasn't the pizza. Sure the sauce was tasty and the selection of toppings were nice but the crust was disappointing. Now having said that the 6 year old we were with enjoyed the soft crust but for the adults some crispness would have been nice. The highlight was actually the salad. We had the lemon asparagus salad. That salad is worth the trip. It's a lettuce based salad perfectly dressed with a certain freshness that if lemon were not in the name I would be quite able to place. But that's wonderful! Because so often when you see the word lemon you getting something really lemony and tart. Not the case here. Definitely order the salad."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Danny Boy's after moving into the area from Philadelphia.  The restaurant atmosphere was pleasant, however a bit confusing since there was no hostess greeting anyone, or sign that we saw instructing us to seat ourselves.  The waitress was adequate - there were no problems with service, but yet no reason to rave about how great she was either.  The biggest issue we had with dining here was the price.  The jojo platter we shared, my specifically asked for \"small side salad\", the small clevelander pizza, and the small cheeseburger pizza were edible, but not worth the incredibly high prices.  I've had larger, better tasting jojo potatoes elsewhere for cheaper price, and the $14./each pizza can be described as \"ordinary\" at best.  My \"small side salad\" turned out to be a $5 expensive bunch of lettuce with a few shredded carrots.  No olives, no cheese, nothing special.  There was a very limited draft beer selection, and prices for craft beer were average $5.50/beer.  Overall, the value just was not there for us.  Dinner for two:  A whopping $60!"}
{"text":"Danny boys is the stuff! everything i have ever ordered from here was always so fresh and yummy! no matter what you order you will get quality! the traditional pizzas and cal zones are great but they also have great specialty pizzas. i tried the taco pizza and it was awesome! you cant ask for a better place. food, service and atmosphere is a-1. they are a little higher in price but its definitely worth it. you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Always a good eat here. Have been coming for years--way back when it was a small place on Detroit in Lakewood.  Always loved the Woogie Bear.  The menu has enlarged over the years.  There is a fast and delicious lunch special daily."}
{"text":"i called to get a tray of lasagne which takes 24 hours to order. The guy offered \"broken lasagne\" which I didn't think I wanted but ended up tasting amazing! Salad was so fresh and delish! Breadsticks were ridiculously delish! A+"}
{"text":"We got carry out this time to come home and watch the Browns game.   And TBH I have had better Danny Boys.  Seems like the toppings on the Chicago were not very hardy and the crust seemed burnt.  $24 later I wasn't impressed with this visit... 5-6yrs ago it my most favorite.   But to make the drive from North Olmsted to get pricey burnt dough I would have to think again next time.   On the flip side the Bread Sticks were fabulous!  And the reason I gave 3 stars was because the bread sticks were worth the drive."}
{"text":"Okay, can someone tell me where I went wrong ordering? I was not thrilled with this place. We started off with the breadsticks, those were good. Then my kids ordered the mac n cheese pizza with kettle chips. My bf and I had the spicy white pizza and split the Texas chicken salad. The kids ate the toppings off the Mac n cheese pizza and complained that it was dry. The spicy white pizza was a sauce less pizza with spices and pizza cheese, topped with chopped spicy pepperoni. I really didn't care for it. It was very dry and the spicy pepperoni over powered everything else. The chicken salad was my favorite. It was a huge bowl of lettuce, bacon, cheese, cole slaw and BBQ chicken. It was fantastic and enough for 2 maybe even 3. Overall I think if I ever go back I will order a pizza with sauce and normal toppings like veggies and traditional meats (pepperoni, sausage etc) just to givemit another try. The breadsticks and salad were the highlight and I'd go back for just those. Just really wasn't impressed with the pizza. Maybe the specialty pizzas aren't that special, I don't know! I wish it had been better because I got really excited to go and was pretty bummed when the pizza sucked."}
{"text":"The epitome of a family-owned, dive restaurant. Some of the best Italian food around, with the largest portions around. Be prepared to take food home for tomorrow!

The bread that is served with salads and pasta is TO DIE FOR yummy! The pizza is the best in Rocky River as far as I'm concerned. The sauce is perfectly sweet and savory. 

It's a very small joint so be prepared to wait during busy times, but it's completely worth it. They even have checkers and chess boards to keep you busy while you wait.

Service is quick and very friendly. Hands down one of the best restaurants on the West side of Cleveland!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza places and always a go to. I only recently discovered it myself but have already taken friends. Not only is their pizza FANTASTIC, the restaurant has such a fun, local feel. They even have playing cards at the tables to enjoy while you are waiting (Im a big card fan so this is such a nice touch for me). I usually stick to cheese pizza because i think it is so good you don,t need any toppings! The staff has always been super friendly which makes the small setup welcoming and homey."}
{"text":"Of the many, many, many pizza places that I have been to in my life, Danny Boys is hands down the very best.

They also seem to be that rare pizza place that actually excels equally with their Italian food (although I only have second hand knowledge here, I'm always too tempted by their pizzas, calzones and fold-overs), rather than just some blah spaghetti and meatballs.

The next time you see Mama Santas win the Free Times's best pizza place award, you'll hopefully be able to feel a sense of shame because you've found Danny Boys."}
{"text":"Great food- great place- really nice and hard-working staff.
The bread is amazing. The buffalo potato chip appetizer was really good. It gets crowded which makes the place even more fun. Full of families, dates etc. a wide range of people. Great creative pizzas- my kids enjoyed everything, especially the bread and playing checkers. Perfect for family pizza night."}
{"text":"The best breadsticks and awesome calzones. There is a big selection of food to choose from. The staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"We grow up in a home where our family eats certain foods and those preferences remain with us all our lives. As we travel or move to new regions we add to the foods that make us happy. 

I left Cleveland for New York City where I attended graduate school and where I held my first big boy job. Jewish deli foods and New York style pizza were added to my comfort foods. Thus, when I returned to Cleveland many years later via Baltimore and Washington, DC, I found I did not like thick crusted pizza loaded with everything raised on a farm. 

I tried thin crusted pizzas every place I heard made them. All had crispy crusts which could not be folded like those in NYC. The best I could do was eat pizza in Pittsburgh where I went several times a year. Pittsburgh pizza means thin crusted pizza with few or no toppings except cheese. 

I have gone to Vincenza's but the crust is reheated in an oven making it crisp. Capri does bake excellent New York style pizza but too far for me to get carry out. I discovered that Danny Boys bakes excellent New York style and in a convenient west side location. I go there for cheese only thin crust pizza so cannot recommend anything else. Next time some New Yorker tells you forgetta bout pizza in Cleveland tell him whatsamatta you, go to Danny Boys."}
{"text":"The pizza is fabulous

Excellent Chicago style pizza., eat here now!"}
{"text":"We just picked up a pizza from Danny Boys...it was terrible. It was extremely under cooked, resembling a piece of cloth with a tiny tan colored crust. The cheese and toppings reached halfway from the center to the tan colored crust, leaving half the slice with a thin bit of the awful tasting sauce and nearly raw dough. Needless to say we will not ever return."}
{"text":"Well this was my first time here as a yelper,also for lunch nice and quiet. Waitress was nice and helpful. The food amazing as usual, we got the breadsticks and a small deluxe special ordered cause of differences on green peppers and mushrooms. They were very accommodating on the part of halfing the toppings. Very good and enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch last Saturday.  The decor is cute- lotsa Sinatra pics.  I must say I think the menu items are pretty expensive.  $16.99 and up for pasta dishes, $10 and up for za....

 The house salad was very \"wet\" and the dressing was sliding off the salad that had less then ripe tomatoes. The garlic/ roll bread was mushy and the side of marinara I requested was almost flavorless.  I ordered the thin crust spinach pizza- it was OK, and Dan ordered the Chicago- basically a patty of sausage inside of a Chicago deep dish pizza- he said it was the only redeeming quality of out meal.  I will probably never go back, since Dewey's is closer and MUCH better."}
{"text":"Great local joint and I hear they're now franchising in other areas across NE Ohio. Staff is very friendly and the food is all very good. The sauce and dough make the pizzas, the fold-overs are a guilty pleasure, and their sandwiches are insanely big...way insanely big. Have not dined-in but have ordered pickup and delivery many times - probably not a bad thing as the place is always jam packed."}
{"text":"My go to pizza place. I have gotten both takeout and dined in at this location. Delicious each time! We choose to make our own pizza but it looks like they have a few combos they make that look like they would hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in you Danny Boy. I stopped in to pick up a deep dish Clevelander style pizza like I have gotten in the past (see my first review) and it was not a good experience. 

The girl working the register/pick up area gave off an unpleasant negative vibe. No smiles. No friendliness. She was just going through the motions of her job and she either was having a bad day or really dislikes the public but is forced to say a disingenuous \"thank you\" anyway. I tried to ask her about this potato pizza I saw on special and she couldn't have been more disinterested in talking to me. It also took her at least a half a dozen tries to get the credit card machine to work. (I currently have an extra charge pending on my credit card from the multiple swipes, hopefully it will fall off since it is not a legit one).

Glad I checked my pizza before I left. Turns out they made me a regular style Clevelander. Big difference when you asked for it deep dish style. If I am going to be spending $15 on a small pizza I want it made the way I asked for. Deep dish is like this hearty Chicago style pie. The regular version is a bit lackluster. It was dinner time and I was hungry. It was a busy night inside and I did not want to wait for the correct pizza to be made so I got a refund for my pizza and left with just my side salad.

I'm just saddened. I was really craving a good slice of pizza and having to eat just stupid lettuce instead doesn't help. I was very specific when calling in my order and even repeated it to make sure they understood what I wanted. Getting the wrong food was one thing, having disagreeable customer service on top of it just made the whole experience bad and makes me not want to go back any time soon.

**Not sure why an older picture of the mac & cheese pizza is attaching to this review, but ready my previous review on it."}
{"text":"Another restaurant for which I have fallen victim to the hype. I get the impression Cleveland desperately wants to have a pizza place to call their own, and that's fine, but this isn't it. 

The place is tiny. We waited half an hour to be seated because they had to push two tables together for our party of six. I didn't think a party of six was an inconvenience, but that's just how small this place is. Most of the patrons were aware of this shortcoming and were at most parties of four, so take note.

As for the food itself, I tried the deep dish and the mac & cheese pizza with no additional toppings.  The deep dish was... ok? I wasn't a fan of the sausage seasoning, which of course, being the huge slab of meat it was, dominated the flavor of the pie. Maybe I'm just not into Chicago-style. I've never had it before this so I can't really compare, but my friends that have had Giordano's said this wasn't like the real thing. As for the mac & cheese pizza, it's always fun to try something a little out there, but just expect it to taste exactly like what it is and nothing more: mac and cheese with potato chips. If I had to do it again (I won't), I would forgo the chips and add ham or bacon. The cheese was really mild so I need a stronger flavor, and the chips didn't really work with the combo. The crust was heavenly though.

Misc... Our waitress was a little off but she was new so that's understandable. Not much selection in the way of booze.

I guess to end on a positive note, they had a deck of playing cards at every table to pass the time."}
{"text":"The best breadsticks Ive ever had hands down. Could make a meal on those w the sauce. Have had both the Chicago and NY style of pizza here. Both are great. My son loves their alfredo fetucinni (sp?)"}
{"text":"Consistent quality of the pizza and of the delivery service!

Our favorite is the Clevelander Pie. 
But we've also had the Chicago style pizza and just \"regular\" pizza with different toppings. All of them are very good. 


I ordered pasta for take out a few times and also liked it."}
{"text":"I've had Danny Boys once before and liked it. It wasn't extraordinary but it was definitely good and worth the money as the ingredients were fresh.  The staff is very nice and the place seems to be very popular. I'd recommend the pizzas that are more unique with other sauces than just the standard tomato sauce."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA EVER! I have introduced many of my friends in college to this place and everyone LOVES it! You don't get any better than this homemade pizza, it's as close to deep dish Chicago pizza as you're gonna get here in Cleveland :) Trust me on this one! I go here at least twice a week, but now I have been picking up the pizza to go because the construction is pretty bad sometimes. Plus let me tell you people this place gets CROWDED! So be prepared to wait and make sure you are craving some amazing Italian food!
 Also, please get the breadsticks, you will fall in love with dough :)"}
{"text":"Been ordering from Donny boys for the past 5 years. Made an order at 10:20pm on a Friday night and received an \"I guess I can take your order\" greeting comment. Well, I guess I Will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Definitely a pizza place that doesn't get enough attention and it has been around for ages.  It's one of the most unique pizza places around with many different creations to choose from and options to make your own too of course.  Their pizza can be a little on the pricey side, but definitely worth it.  If you're not really into pizza, they have great salads and other options as well. It gets a little crowded on the weekends, especially since it's so small inside, so you'll definitely want to plane ahead."}
{"text":"The warm asparagus salad was crazy good!! So many layers of flavor! And big enough to split. We shared a pasta dish with chicken, veggies and a tomato cream sauce. The garlic knots, which come with each course, were fluffy, fresh and perfect company. The server was attentive, personable and made our visit great!! Whether you're dining in or taking out..this is a go to, old school restaurant"}
{"text":"Bread sticks. Boom.
Pizzas. Boom stick.
Calzones. Boombam.
Sandwiches. Boomtown City.
Why are you not there right now?!"}
{"text":"Carb lovers must get here as quickly as possible. Every bread item here is out of this world.

The location is quaint and has a family feel. You can't go wrong with a Frank Sinartra theme. The dining room is tiny and fills quickly, but it's always worth the wait. I like that they have tables with Checkers, Chess, and Scrabble to play while you wait.

I love the Italian Pierogis and the Polish Pierogies. The pierogis are always delicious with plenty of meat, onions, and peppers on top. The roll that comes on the side is so tasty. The actual bread is full of flavor. It isn't just the butter and seasoning that makes it great. The Double Crust Gangster Zone is a delicious combination of the flavorful bread, meats, and tasty marinara for dipping. The small (6 cut) is large enough for two people and is about the size of a small pizza."}
{"text":"Order pizza from this place while driving through town - amazing! I highly recommend the Clevelander; perfect balance of salty-garlicky-goodness. I would venture to say it's the tastiest restaurant in the area. #YUM"}
{"text":"I am usually not a big pizza fan but when I tried just two bites of Danny Boy's pizza, I was hooked. My first visit I had a Buffalo Chicken Sub, but next time I come here, I will definitely be eating a pizza. My buffalo sub was delicious. You get it when it is still super hot, and you actually have to wait for it cool down before you take a bite of it. The banana peppers on the sub were super fresh and hot, and I loved every bite of my sandwich. I cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places- love their chopstix salad, Chicago style pizza and those addicting little breadsticks..."}
{"text":"Danny Boys is AMAZING!! If you haven't tried it - you need it. I've had their pizzas, fold overs and sandwiches and have never left disappointed. My favorite dish is the Tony Soprano (spaghetti and meatballs in a sub roll) and also, if you order the bread sticks (you should) ask for some alfredo sauce for dipping. SO GOOD"}
{"text":"My first time here, it was great! The best breadsticks I've ever tried! I also had the buffalo woogie...excellent. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The pizza has good flavor but the \"original\" Clevelander boast about lots of pepperoni and had very minimal.  The pizza also was drowning in sauce, although good tasting sauce, way too much.

Other issue was paying $21 to have one medium pizza delivered before tip.  So pricey on the pizza is an issue.  Maybe dining in, waiting for decent coupons and trying something other than pizza would be the way to go."}
{"text":"I had the Cajon chicken Alfredo recently, and it was great. Not to spicy, just the right amount. It was like 2 servings in 1. I'm glad I live down the street from them."}
{"text":"Pizza is consistently good here. I recently ordered a pizza with the thin crust and it really didn't hold up to the toppings, but the regular crust is always a hit. The breadsticks are amazing, good wings (not too big, you can tell they aren't on steroids) and the salads are a nice size. Great local pizza place."}
{"text":"What a treat. The breadsticks were delicious, especially when smothered in the  white chicken chili or jambalaya. We enjoyed the gangster pie in the smallest form and still took some home. 

The service was solid and the place was clean. 

The bathroom can be a little tight though so make sure you clear out before you go."}
{"text":"Awesome food and staff!!  Take out ready on time!!  Love the Texas grilled chicken salad, chicken fold over and the Chicago Pie!!  YUM"}
{"text":"Mmm. I love this pizza :) and the fluffy  bread :) I will defiantly be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"Great place for some unique pizzas and pasta combinations, i prefer the pasta though. if you are looking for small portions this is definitely not a place to visit, but if you are looking for a good fill, try it.

as a note this place is small, and like the Lakewood melt location, you might have to wait for a table. they have a few activities to keep you occupied while you wait, like checkers and a chess board. It is cramped at times, depending on where you sit, but food is tasty so i tend to look past that. its a well known spot if you live in the Lakewood/Rocky River area

good over all in my book."}
{"text":"Based on recommendations from Yelp!, we made our first trip to Danny Boy's today.  We arrived around 4pm and it was fairly empty inside.  We got a table and were attended to immediately.  The menu was so big and the choices were were so many that we were actually relieved when our waitress suggested the Sunday Family Special (A family-sized pizza, 2 salads and bread sticks for $25)

The salads arrived with bread sticks on the side.  We were impressed!  The salad was very fresh and tasted good.  A moment later our bread sticks arrived!!  Holy crap!  I thought the bread sticks that came with the salad were what we ordered... Nope we also got a full plate of delicious, soft. garlic-y bread sticks with a generous portion of dipping sauce.

Our pizza arrived just as the place started filling up for dinner.  The crust was fresh and crispy and the cheese was gooey and stringy.  The sauce was a bit sweeter than I prefer - but it was still delicious.  

After all that bread - we brought home half a pizza and a few bread sticks for snacking later.  We all agreed to make Danny Boy's a new place in our pizza rotation.

Thanks Danny Boy's and thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"I like danny boys better than angelos in lakewood! The breadsticks are amazing and inexpensive.  I like to get a side of alfredo sauce for dipping in addition to the marinara sauce. Pizza is great. Meatball sub is excellent! The layout of the store is tight and it's sort of annoying to push your way through people to pick up your order at the register, but that's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, especially for those who love Frank and the others of the Rat Pack (i.e. my in-laws.) Very small quarters though. Chairs at one table touch the back of those at the table next to you. Service was quick (almost too quick).  No need to order appetizers as they provide you with a plate of their enormous \"breadsticks.\"  We were newbies and ordered an appetizer only to quickly cancel that when they brought us the bread. We had a party of 4, no one ordered pizza. We stuck to the entrees.  Two who ordered pastas were very happy with their meals..spaghetti/meatballs and some penne pasta dish.  I had the half slab of ribs with perogies (no peppers, please, so this is what my food portion of the review is based on.  Here's how I think they prepare and serve their ribs, at least this is how it tasted.
1. Pre-cook ribs and put in freezer for up to a month(s)??
2. When rib order is placed take ribs out of freezer and into microwave until steaming hot and defrosted.  So steaming hot that it is still scalding on customers plate 10 minutes after it's been put on their table. (not normal)
3. Dump a half a bottle of random BBQ sauce on Ribs.

The ribs tasted freezer burnt and microwaved.  Yuck!  My guess is this is why they put so much sauce on them, to cover the bad taste.  They were fall off the bone, so they must have been cooked correctly at some point.  Glad I only ordered half a rack...but only ate half of that.  Filled up on perogies, which were nothing special and needed to be sauteed longer, and bread.  

3 stars because it was a fun atmosphere, effecient service and the others at my table enjoyed their entrees.  Maybe next time I should stick with pizza as recommended by others."}
{"text":"You will begin salivating as soon as you walk in the door, so I'd recommend ordering an app.  We got free breadsticks (thanks Yelp!) to hold us over before the big boys arrive.  The playing cards on the table took our mind off of devouring our neighbors food; also good for impressing (or turning off) your date with magic.  

We split a buffalo chicken foldover, small size.  It was 6 huge slices and delicious.  We also ordered Dean's Rat Pack Pie (smaller and thinner than the regular pizzas) which had amazingly fresh ingredients, including vegetables which canceled out the large dough intake.

It was a great experience and I can't wait to heat up the remainder of my food tomorrow.  My car is going to smell like leftover heaven."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something different from my normal pizza places. I was so disappointed. First off the delivery driver was very rude. It was snowing and he couldn't get up the driveway. He wanted me to come down and get it. When I wouldn't and told him to park in my neighbors drive he was put out by that as well. He ended up walking up my driveway with an attitude. I gave him what I considered a generous tip. He didn't seem happy with that. As he walked away he made a rude remark about getting out of my driveway. My pizza and bread were cold. It's bad when you can say your side salad was the best part of the meal. Going to stick with my normal pizza spots from now on. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Seeing \"Est. 1991\" on the pizza box during tonight's visit to Danny Boy's I realized I have been going there for nearly two decades.  

This was shocking to me, as it was incontrovertible evidence of my increasing age, but also reassuring because for all that time, Danny Boy's has provided consistently excellent food and service. 

I would place Danny Boy's pizza in the same realm as Angelo's in that they both have a number of specialty pizzas that are sure to excite your tongue, satisfy your stomach, and clog your arteries.  In fact, when it comes to gourmet pizza on the West Side, these two places are neck and neck.  

DB's is the first pizza place I was aware of to put pasta on top of the pizza along with toppings like seasoned wedge fries and pierogies.  It was this commitment to over the top menu items that brought me in, and it was their skillful execution that has kept me coming back.  

The most recent addition is the Downtown Macaroni and Cheese pizza which takes the carb overload even further by adding kettle chips as a topping to bring some crunch to the otherwise gooey deliciousness.  The Loaded baked potato and Pierogie pies are similarly tasty and coma-inducing.

The foldovers have always been good too, breaking out from italian side of things with gyro and cheeseburger offerings.  

Though only available as an appetizer, as opposed to an a la carte item, the wings are a notable offering.  For $9 you get 14 meaty baked wings in your choice of sauce, WITH two breadsticks (DB's are fantastic) celery, and blue cheese.  This is a great deal on some really great wings.

I haven't had them in a long time, but I remember the sandwiches and ribs being very good as well.  To be honest, I don't ever remember being disappointed with anything I've ever ordered at DB's.

The dining room is on the small side, and it can get pretty crowded during peak times, so plan accordingly if you are not getting carryout.  The restaurant is sort of a shrine devoted to Frank Sinatra and to a lesser extent, the rest of the Rat Pack.  A little incongruous with the Irish sounding name, but then again so is the Italian menu.  With food this good, I'm willing to let that slide."}
{"text":"We had ordered Danny Boys for a work lunch once and I had been meaning to stop in. I enjoyed the Jimmy Whispers sandwich- even after being delivered, it was still really delicious. Kinda messy, but worth it.
Fiancee and I walked in on a Thursday evening and I immediately felt like I was in my home-away-from-home, New York City. I loved the Italian, Frank Sinatra, Rat Pack vibe going on here. The decorations were appealing and I loved the Christmas lights. It was also a very comfortable temperature. We grabbed a table and poured over the menu. I wanted to try everything, but I kept it simple... Traditional pepperoni pizza. I also wanted a salad- back in the day, a salad was how I judged a restaurant. 

The house salad- nothing fancy to most people. But, the greens were fresh and, well, green!  There was plenty of cheese and toppings. I ordered the house Italian dressing which was so good. I love the breadstick knot that came with my salad. Craving satisfied.
Then the pizza came. It was so good. I wouldn't exactly call it NY style (I like mine flat, crispy, and big enough to fold) but it was really good. Flavorful, bold sauce on top of a crispy chewy crust. Dan really liked his Bing's Buffalo Chicken Melt Woogie platter. It took a minute to figure out what a Woogie is, but it's basically like a calzone sandwich. It was a great size, came with fries (which he Cajun-ed up, of course) and not quite enough ranch dressing. Our server was so nice and attentive. It was pretty busy and it seemed like she had a lot of tables, but she did a great job helping all the customers."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good pizza this place is not good pizza they charged me 25.00 for a burnt cold pizza i would recommend papa johns over this place save yourself the heartache"}
{"text":"Have been here many, many times.....great, consistent pizza.....in fact, we are now going to say it's the BEST in the entire city !!! The crust, the cheese and the sauce is bar none! And we have tried many, many different places in the entire city. Don't change ANYTHING HERE!!"}
{"text":"I forgot how much I really liked Danny Boys until a few minutes ago. My family ordered Danny Boys from time to time growing up. It used to be located on Detroit by Nicholson and that really old house. They went upscale somewhere in the 90's and sold out and moved to Rocky River, like many Lakewood residents also have done. It is somewhat thick crust, chunky sauce and a baked in a ferris wheel oven. It is excellent cold the next day. If there were a Cleveland style, it would probably be a mixture of Danny Boys, Angelos and Antonios in my opinion. A weird hybrid pizza that is halfway between New York and Chicago. At least it is good at what it is, not trying to be something that it is not. They do charge too much. It helps to use the little coupons they put out in the mail."}
{"text":"Went here with a buddy, who recommended this place. He said their portions are HUGE and this was definitely an understatement.
The decor is very \"little Italy\"-esque...I personally thought it came across as trying too hard. But regardless of decor, it's ultimately about the food. And the food really shined. We started with the Badabing buffalo chips. These are kettle cooked potato chips doused in buffalo wing sauce and bleu cheese...basically a potato chip buffalo wing. I couldn't stop eating these. The chips are so crispy that it maintains it's crisp even when doused in sauce.

For the entree, I had the Tony Soprano sub...basically a spaghetti and meatball sub. The thing was massive and I only got through less than half until I was stuffed. I just love the idea of spaghetti in a sub bun. I had the cajun fries with it. I really love crispy fries and these were the perfect level of crispiness.

Highly recommended if you are hungry and are a fan of food comas."}
{"text":"Okay, these guys totally make sandwiches the size of your head. Definitely the best Chicken Parmigiana sandwich I've ever had. I've had a few slices as well, and their really good, but it's the sandwiches that keep me coming back.

When I think of one of their sandwiches, it normally haunts me for days - and everything else I eat just pales in comparison to the memory of their sandwiches."}
{"text":"For pizza places, this one is on the top of our list. 
I love the sauce and the bread-sticks at this place. I don't eat pork and many of the menu options have it on there, but that doesn't take away from the place. I love the botanical Clevelander. The Lady is a Tramp calzone. Yum. Even their wraps are good. 
I love going to a local pizzeria and being able to eat-in rather than carry out. It's just fun. The dining room in this place could be a little bit bigger, but they make do. If there is a wait though, there isn't all that much room to stand around. 
Every time I've been here the service is decent, not stellar or anything, but this IS a pizza place. 
But, despite the above minor issues, we keep coming back cause the pizza is so good. We always get a side salad to start cause that comes with one breadstick (they are huge, so that is plenty)- and then I can at least pretend I ate something healthy. I've had the Chicago style and the thin crust and both are good. 

The ONLY reason I'm taking off a star is because there are so few non-pork options on the menu. Overall though, I think you should try it (and bring me an order of breadsticks while you are there)."}
