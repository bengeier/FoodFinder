{"text":"Great \"mom and pop\" pizza!  Service was fantastic and the pizza was very tasty. It's a thinner crust, not greasy at all, with a slightly sweet sauce. You can buy one/get one as well as save if you pay with cash. While I was waiting for my pizza people called and came in and were known by name. This is the kind of place I want to support!  I hope you do too. There's a few tables and chairs if you can't wait to get home before you start eating!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend. EXCELLENT!! This will be my new go to spot for pizza every time! Great service and great pizza!"}
{"text":"Damn, I think they are closed for good. Just drove by and the sign is gone. Hopefully they're just replacing it but I have a bad feeling on that"}
{"text":"Homestyle food and service. Subs and the bread especially are amazing. Huge portions, enough to take some home."}
{"text":"Wow....when I was talking to the owner he said it was the same family as Master Pizza.  Boy was he right!  This took me back!  Excellent pizza excellent service.  Can't wait to order from them again."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizzas and service. So much better than any national chain pizza store"}
{"text":"This place is close to my sons daycare and though ai would give it a try. This is the BEST Pizza in and around North Olmsted!!! SO glad to have come across this place!"}
{"text":"maybe they were having a bad day so i guess I will give them the benefit of the doubt, however yesterday was my first day trying them out, and probably my last.  The sauce was good, and the ingredients looked fresh, so it was promising.  That being said, once i opened the pizza it looked a bit burned.  The pizza tasted a bit dried out.  I also ordered the fried mushrooms, which were over cooked.  The concept seemed promising but overall we were pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and great service! You have to give these guys a try. They're a lil \"mom and pop\" place, but their pizza is fantastic. They also have the ability to provide larger sheet cut pizza's which taste awesome. I will 100% be going back to Maria's pizzeria soon!"}
{"text":"We ordered from Marias. Monday evening. I live right around the corner and I must admit the first time I have tried this place.  It was excellent pizza, the way it should be.  The sauce the crust the added items everything was grest.  It was not your same old pizza that usually get when you hit places down lorain ave.  The staff was nice and I got exactly what I ordered in 10 minutes can,t beat that they also have specials on monday and tuesday.  If you pay in cash you can also save some money.  Love it and  remember help local restaurants and stay out of chains!"}
{"text":"Great homemade pizza. Fresh ingredients. Great crust and sauce. Definitely not a chain and is real fresh food. Owner is always present and the place is clean. Great service. Definitely recommend for carry out. Support the local owned places before they're gone!"}
{"text":"I have only been there once but it was a clean mom and pop pizza shop. Joe, the owner is super nice and makes a decent pie.  It has thinner crust, good sauce- not too sweet/not too much or too little, good cheese,  fresh toppings, slightly on the greasy side.  It's a decent pizza.  I will go back."}
{"text":"Nice little shop, very limited seating, Christian owner, Joe is awesome!  Old school thin crust pepperoni and mushroom, was the best I have had in a long time!  Great conversation with the owner!  Truly a blessing to have stumbled on this place!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza and sandwiches. High quality ingredients and owner takes a lot of pride in the food."}
{"text":"We received a flyer while out shopping today so decided to try it out tonight. Well, while ordering for delivery the OWNER said \"Is that all? Come on, We'd like to go home.\" So we decided to not even bother ordering and cancelled. Very UNPROFESSIONAL!!! Don't waste your time. If they can't be respectful to customers who knows how they are with preparing food, health codes etc."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  I love the taste of the sauce.  You can definitely tell this is not a chain pizza place. This is our familie's favorite pizza. I highly recommend Maria's."}
{"text":"Good pizza, and a nice & friendly owner operator.  A short distance from 480/Stearns, ordered and waited for a couple of medium pies and chatted with Joe, the owner.  Works everyday and puts his everything into his pizzas.  Well worth the time."}
{"text":"Just ordered for the first time because it was recommended on Yelp.   It was a great pizza.  Sorry that it took us this long to try this place.  Looking forward to our next pizza"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for taking me 2 mins off my normal driving route. The pizza here was great. The crust was a perfect combination of chewy, crispy and light. The sauce was flavorful but not overly sweet or herbed. The cheese stretched from my slice to my mouth, perfecto!  I look forward to my next trip to North Olmsted because the owner was very friendly and the service was great.  Caution: beware eating pizza and driving:)"}
{"text":"Solid Cleveland style pizza. All around good, nice medium thick crust cooked properly. Salads are fine."}
{"text":"Pizza lovers, you have to check this new place out.  I'm always in search of some of the better tasting pizzas here in NE Ohio, having been spoiled growing up in the 'pizza perfect' NYC/Jersey area.  My main complaint the last 17 years here is that not many places know how to make an excellent pizza around these parts.   Usually, the sauce is disgusting bland, the cheese flavorless, or the crust tastes like something from your supermarket's frozen section.  Not so Maria's Pizzeria!  I had seen the 'grand opening' of this pizzeria in a local ad flyer, and decided to get a 'pie' to sample myself.  I ordered a half cheese, half pepperoni large, and was pleasantly surprised overall!  The sauce truly tastes fresh and balanced, with just the right amount of spices, and the cheese is excellent and 'stringy', the way it should be.  The crust  is excellent as well, but if I had only one piece of constructive advice to give, it would be to make it a bit thicker to add some volume and 'airiness' overall.  Don't get me wrong... it's excellent as is, but it would be even better if thicker.   In conclusion, I must add Maria's Pizzeria to my list of the best tasting pizzas in NE Ohio!"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza, wings, cheesy bread and  Mozzarella sticks.   Best I've had in a long time. If your looking for great pizza check it out. Perfectly cooked!!!"}
