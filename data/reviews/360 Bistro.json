{"text":"Fresh food. Great beers on tap. Very attentive yet not hovering wait staff. The chicken caprese sandwich and mac n cheese are off the hook."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. I called to place an order using a mailer coupon for buy one get one free pizza. I was told I had to dine in to use the coupon. I reviewed the coupon and it does not indicate the offer is dine in only. I spoke with a manager and he was unwilling to honor the coupon for a pick up.  I will take my business elsewhere! This is not a way to win customers for a new restaurant. Especially with the power of social media."}
{"text":"The staff at this restaurant is 5 star. We were seated right away on a Friday night, our waiter was friendly and attentive, suggested several menu items, checked how we were doing several times, kept us informed about the status of our meal, as well as finding out a little bit about us. The bartender was quick and knowledgeable and at least 3 other staff members thanked us for coming and wished us goodnight. Unfortunately, we visited because we were hungry and the food was barely worth 2 stars....the pizza was lackluster and reminded us of those sold on the kids menu at other places. It was slightly greasy like pizza you'd expect at a hamburger place and not at an Italian restaurant who had devoted a large portion of the menu to \"brick oven\" pizza. I wanted to like this apparently non chain restaurant and would return for drinks but not the food."}
{"text":"Finally; a great alternative to the University area chain restaurants!  Our family has been here twice since it opened.   I can see their diligence in really listening to their customers' suggestions and making improvements as a result.  We love their Thirsty Thursdays (LOTS of good beer selections!) and the buy one/ get one appetizer special that runs in August.  We've had the artichokes (our favorite), coconut shrimp, mushrooms, soup, Chicken Marsala, Chicken Franchaise, Salmon, Pasta Primavera, and Pizza.  And of course, what foodie wouldn't want to try the dessert?  Their creme brulee was a very good choice.  People of University--spread the word and definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Toni Smith On 11/9/14 my daughter had a coupon spend $100 get $50 off dinner. She invited me to accompany her family for dinner. As my grand daughter and I got to the restaurant before my daughter we notice that NO one was at the entrance to RRG, she then walked over to the Bar area where several employees were huddled together, she ask is the RRG is open, they said you had to come into that area. We told them that it would be a party of 5. We went to the table and Brittany (waitress) brought over a Game menu...we ask if this is the only food being served she said Yes, she said she would ask the Chef; she returns and says this is the only food we are serving today. We left and as I approached the front door, I spoke with Paula Hong at the front desk, and I quote \"I want to complain/or have concern\" she ask what was the problem I told her that the RRG was not serving a full menu tonight. She then said that on Sundays is slow night and called the back with no answer; so Paula walked to the back and return with both the Game menu and the regular menu and said Yes they are serving dinner. At this point my daughter and her family are also on site and we all walk back to the same location and the the same group of employees are huddled together again looking at a tablet as we walk pass them again and they NEVER LOOK UP or said ANYTHING....as we continue to walk down this walkway we realize that we need to turn around and go back to the lounge area (they were 1 bartender, another man with a black cap on, one blonde head women and one dark head women and Brittany). So we had to ask again is this the area to eat....AT THAT POINT Brittany says YES....I then say to her so why did you let us walk pass you....again she looks at us like we were speaking a foreign language. My POINT OF THIS IS......as employees in the customer service business CUSTOMER SERVICESHOULD BE #1. I then walk back to the front desk to speak to Paul Hong and complain about the unprofessional behavior of the staff. She than walk back with me to get the lounge mgr Jenn Adams. Ms. Adams spoke with me and I expressed my dislike like of how we were treated when we came in. Ms. Adams was not that convincing and she did apologize for the unprofessionalism of her staff. We finally settled in for dinner and the dinner was GREAT. Would I eat there again or recommend anyone NO! FYI...I use to be a secret shopper where we would go to different resturant and evaluate the food and customer service. This experience would have gotten low marks for customer service. Greeting customers is a MUST in this industry even if you don't know what they need, just to look up and smile...makes a person feel WELCOME and this reflects on the Embassy Suite. Receipt #1387"}
{"text":"When this place first opened, my husband, friends, and I really enjoyed it. The food was great, especially the macaroni and cheese. The atmosphere was what you'd expect when going to a nice dinner out. However, I am not sure what has happened in the last few months. Apparently due to a change in management they have cut their menu down drastically taking away some of the better options, including the macaroni and cheese and salmon BLT. Big mistake. We ordered the 2 for $20, which is a little misleading on menu. You're thinking you get two pizzas plus two salads but you only get one pizza, which in some cases is not even getting as better dealthan just ordering individually. Definitely not worth the money. We spent $29 with tip for a tiny pizza,  two very small salads, and my husband's iced tea. I wouldn't have necessarily minded that if the pizza was really good, but it was not. It was just average. We were left unsatisfied and very disappointed. Also, we went on a Wednesday expecting to find a nice quiet place to eat. Instead, they had half of the restaurant closed off with a DJ playing loud music for what I'm assuming was to be some sort of private party eventually. However, there were only the DJ and a couple people over there during the time we were having dinner. Seems like a waste to have someone preparing so early, playing music so loud that we couldn't even hear each other speak. This place had more of a sports bar feel with Italian food. If you're drinking then you'll probably be ok with the mediocre food. However, if you want a nice dinner, we suggest you go somewhere else. We had thought that this place was going to become one of our new favorites until new management came in and changed it for the worse. The food is not as good, the options are few, and the atmosphere has gone downhill. We definitely won't be going back and we will make sure to warn our friends and family as well."}
{"text":"The service was great. As soon as my wife and I walked in for lunch we were greeted right away. We did the 2 for $20 deal and ordered the LaBella pizza. I was very disappointed when I saw the portion size of our pizza. It was the size of a Tostinos microwave pizza! It did come with 2 salads but still not worth the price point. A kid size pizza and 2 salads - not worth $20 bucks at all! I highly recommend this business revisits the price point."}
{"text":"Food excellent!  Not a long wait. casual neat attire.  Rustic itallian decor.  Would recommend entrees chicken marsala(my new favorite) and chicken franchaise. Daniel was our server/bartender and Chris was an awesome General Manager.  I would definitely come back again. And I heard they're extending $5 martinis special past Mondays to everyday. Wed night Trivia starts at 8 plus half off on wine....Ask Chris"}
{"text":"Great food, was very impressed and I'm the pickiest eater! Hope this place does well- go try it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the area and found this place.  EVERYTHING was awesome.  We got calamari and fried mozzarella and both were delicious, especially the fried mozzarella. It was cheesy and yummy, not the typical cheese sticks. Then we split the burger and a build your own pizza.  Both delicious, especially the burger, it was juicy and well seasoned.  Combined with $5 house wines and great service, we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant 5 times now the food was excellent! customer service was also great. This weekend i have the opportunity to have the brunch the best grits i have ever had no chunks or lumps like most i have had in the past prices were very reasonable! I definitely recommend this to anyone who appreciates great quality food and great customer service!"}
{"text":"We checked this place out with a groupon deal. I would return and pay full price. The food was great and so was the service. I ordered the pasta primavera and my husband ordered the chicken Marsala. Both were delicious! There was an issue with my order and it was solved quickly."}
{"text":"the restaurant changed name, atmosphere, and menu yesterday. we really enjoyed the place last month, not now. Quite a disappointment. now just another routine Italian restaurant, and not very good. service slow and poor,pizza no better than grocery frozen. really too bad, it had great possibilities."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and service and the pizza was perfect! We don't live all that close by but will make a point to come back.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing from start to finish. If you go, you should ask to sit in DQ's section. He is the best waiter we've ever had anywhere. The food is absolutely amazing. The managers are very involved and talk to all of the tables. This might be our new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had been meaning to try this place for a while; things finally worked out for us to give it a shot tonight. So glad we did! The service was absolutely perfect. Both the host and our server were friendly and attentive. Things came out in the right order, in the right quantity, and exactly as we ordered them. A nice touch - we ordered a take-out order too; as our server delivered the check, he said \"It'll be about 4 more minutes on that.\" Besides being perfectly timed, that was a nice change from the \"It should be ready soon\" that you often hear. The food was great. We split the portabello \"frites', which were good. Fried mushrooms, just enough batter, and a creamy dipping sauce. My wife got a chopped salad with grilled chicken and the broccoli cheese soup; I got the goat cheese salad and a half-dozen grilled oysters.  The grilled chicken was *perfect* - cooked on a nice high heat so well that I could smell the char on it as it came down to the table. The broccoli soup ... well, I'm not going to think about how many calories were in this decadent, wonderful, creamy, buttery, rich concoction. Except I just did. The goat cheese salad was well-put-together, well proportioned, and huge. The oysters were tasty and drowning in delicious garlic butter.  All told it was a wonderful experience, we will be back, and I hope they thrive here!"}
{"text":"CLOSED 12/21/14 Bought a deal on living social, drove 30 minutes to get there, business is closed!"}
{"text":"Got the lobster ravioli, it was okay. It is not made at the restaurant. I was told it comes shipped individually wrapped. Got an order of 1/2 dozen oysters, good size but flavorless. Got the tiramisu for dessert, it was okay. Big plus it is half off all wine Wednesdays. Christopher the bartender was awesome, great service!"}
{"text":"Food was good for the price. Live music on patio and Karokee inside on Friday night was a good time. Pizza and Chicken Marsala was very good, and the lobster ravioli was aslo tasty. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Nice, much needed addition to the university area. Food and service was great. Way better than all the local chain options! Hope this place well! The Mac-n-cheese is def with the visit!"}
{"text":"Skip the chain restaurant and come here! Me and my boyfriend went here for my birthday. the ambiance was perfect. casual yet it still felt like i was celebrating. Our waiter was very kind. I was shocked to not see this placed packed with people. We started with the buschetta and coconut shrimp appetizers. The bruschetta had the perfect amount of garlic and balsamic and was perfectly toasted. The coconut shrimp had a delicious island taste without being too sweet. For our main course we got pizzas and the fettucine with salmon. The salmon was cooked amazingly. the pizza was delicious and not to mention BUY ONE GET ONE FREE after 8pm! I ate one there and took the other to go.  My boyfriend also got the broccoli cheddar IPA soup which he enjoyed. All this food only cost $50! We were so shocked at how cheap it all was. I definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"360 bistro was really good.. And the atmosphere was really nice! I have the Chicken Alfredo and it was on point!! With the Cesar salad which was perfect! And the crème brûlée was good, the only thing was they shouldn't have a have burnt the coconut on top of it... Don't like the taste of burnt coconut... I would def go again!  Oh and the service was really good and the food presentation was good as well!"}
{"text":"Management was horribly rude. Menu clearly stated \"Build your own pizza up to 5 toppings for $7.99\". After we ordered, manager stated that the $7.99 only included cheese pizza, and additional toppings were$1/each. That CLEARLY was not what the menu stated, and he refused to honor their menu price. Even if it was a mistake on the menu, they should have honored what was printed there, and eaten the $5.   So hopefully the $5 he saved the restaurant was worth all of the bad publicity and loss of 3 customers who LOVE to dine out."}
{"text":"Quick review - delicious pizza! Great crispy crust that was \"slightly burned\" which I LOVE! Got my own \"make it yourself\" pizza and added Shredded Motz, Meatballs, Sausage, Mushrooms and Parmesian Reggiano cheese to make a heavenly pie. The crust is home made with fresh herbs built in. Tuesday was $2.50 bottle beer night so I opted for a Duck Rabbit Milk Stout....for $2.50! I'll take that everytime! Good service (dem peeps r not from round here......New Yorkers...LOL) and they made good recommendations. Total dinner bill for a 5 topping, 10\" pizza with a Beer came to under $12! Not bad! I am always looking for new places to go before my Tuesday French language classes and this is an excellent option, especially for those of you like me wanting \"Non-Chain\" restaurants. If so then give this place a try!"}
{"text":"You know how your teacher's sometimes say \"you could be so good if you would only apply yourself?\"  Well I kinda feel that way about 360 Bistro. Tons of potential they are just not there yet.  Located in the food desert of the university area they are certainly one of the few locally owned places in the neighborhood.    Cocktails are stiff and steep about $10 each.   Pizzas are BOGO after 8pm. The crust is amazing but overall I was little underwhelmed after being sold so hard on their fresh, better, best ingredients.  They are still tweaking and revising their menu so I can't want to give them another try in a month or so. This has potential to be an amazing place.  Next visit will try their chili and broccoli and cheese soup made with local beers."}
{"text":"Maybe we just picked an off night, but I was very unimpressed. We walked in at 6:45 on a Saturday night, expecting to have to wait for a table. Instead, we had to wait for the hostess, who was nowhere in sight. With all of the NCAAF on tv, I was surprised how many seats were empty. Once we were finally seated, our waiter appeared promptly to take our order. We started with bruschetta, which was good, but not good enough to bring home what we didn't finish. And at nearly $10, seemed very pricey for some bread with tomatoes and dressing.   We had heard that the mac & cheese was award winning, so my daughter ordered it from the kids menu. When it arrived, it wasn't the \"real\" mac & cheese, it was the open a bag and microwave kind. She was hungry, so we let it be. My Wife ordered the lasagna, which she liked, but again at $12, was too pricey for what she got. I ordered the Tuscan Panini, which was very tasty.   I don't think we'll be back, and if the number of empty seats on a Saturday night is any sign of what is in their future, they might want to think about changing things up."}
{"text":"Great pizza and spinach dip. Nice a atmosphere. Take out available. The key lime pie is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Have not had a bad dish yet! Granted, I'm not a seafood person so I can't say if it's good here or not but their pizza is delicious! I've also tried there chicken alfredo, spinach artichoke dip, and a few of their pizza selections-all really good."}
{"text":"Finally!  A great non-chain restaurant in the University Area!  Great pizzas, awesome brunch including red velvet waffles and breakfast pizza.  Yum!  I'm so happy!"}
{"text":"360 Bistro is closed. Doors locked, lights out, no cars. (It shouldn't be getting one star, but won't let me post without it.)"}
{"text":"This place won't last long.  Most the food is FROZEN and just heated up or maybe battered and deep fried. The place is EMPTY all the time. The kitchen doesn't care how a customer asked for the food to be cooked (medium for example is requested and they kill it 3x over and then step on it to make sure it comes out like cardboard) and the WAIT STAFF ARGUES with the customer telling them that is how its cooked.  Well, if that is how its cooked why didn't the wait staff SAY THAT from the start when the order was placed!  BURNT pizza is BLACK and the waiter is saying that is not burnt.  HA I was there one time before and the Pizza was perfectly light golden brown - not one ounce of BURNT spots on it.  The kitchen obviously doesn't know how to monitor & cook the food correctly. Oh BTW, the manager was not in and the Head Chef was suppose to be in charge of the place!  Not once did he come out from his hiding place (the Kitchen) to address any of the matters. Mind you there were only 3 tables that customers were using - as I said nobody was there, they were not swamped in the kitchen. +++++++++++++++ Another note - they are WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!!  They give small portions and charge a lot!!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on the My Fab5 Charlotte Instagram account and decided to try lunch with a friend. There isn't much in the University area aside from chain restaurants so I thought this would be a welcomed addition. As other's have noted the menu is somewhat limited. I'm not a big pizza fan aside from the good ol favorite pizza hut so that only left panini's and pasta dishes. We started off with an appetizer of mozzarella sticks, they actually were 3 huge triangles of fried mozzarella, which were pretty good. Then I had the Tuscan Panini with fries. This sandwich was great especially the pesto aioli sauce. My friend had the Caprese chicken Panini and she enjoyed her sandwich was well.  We arrived around 12:30pm and the restaurant as kinda empty, not sure when they opened but maybe they just need to drum up more business. I do think they should expand their pasta menu to include a lemon butter sauce. If a restaurant does not include a lemon butter or a very light sauce I usually skip right past the pasta section . I think as time goes on they will pick up business, it's right beside Chilli's and Cheddars so I'm sure people are starting to notice. They may need to work on their advertising because I wasn't exactly sure what type of restaurant it was but I 'm glad I came in. Overall the service was great and the food was good I would come back to eat again.    A staff member stopped by to tell us about the DJ they have on Saturday nights . I believe he used to dj at Bull and Barrister and apparently it turns into more of a lounge atmosphere at night. I may go back later in the evening to check this out one night."}
{"text":"Mediterranean shrimp scampi was great!  Mango tea is great.  Chicken Franchaise is great! Everything made in house. They even have foot handles in the bathroom. The only issue I had was the silverware. They need to upgrade their forks and spoon to something that is a better quality. I felt as though I was eating with a flimsy sharp edged fork that would cut me."}
{"text":"I've seen the sign from WT Harris a few times and finally stopped today... needed a Bloody mary to quell the slight hangover from my bottle of wine late last night so I thought I'd check it out. Looks nice enough. Service was good. The prices don't seem ridiculous. Nice little patio. Bloody mary is nice and spicy. I actually came in to grab some oysters but apparently they are all out... Although I'm not really complain as my server let me know that upon arrival the seafood was poor quality. At least they had the decency to not just serve it, like I've seen some places do. I ordered the ahi instead. It was perfect... the \"crust\", sesame seeds, was awesome. The sauce was good without being too much and the presentation was nice. A little sad about my oysters though... gives me a good excuse to come back, I suppose."}
{"text":"Salmon BLT, Mac & Cheese, Lobster Ravioli  Food was good, salmon a little overdone. Service was outstanding as well. Would go again, and recommend to others."}
{"text":"I was super excited to finally have a chic place to brunch in University City but unfortunately this place was a disappointment. It is possible that they just didn't have everything together because it was their first weekend serving brunch but overall the menu seemed a little ambitious for the chef's abilities.   First, almost everything is a la carte so if you order a waffle then you just get a waffle. Same with the french toast. The sides are $2.99 each so if you want bacon and eggs on the side the meal will be nearly $20.   I got the salmon eggs benedict with a red pepper hollandaise sauce. It was interesting mainly because they use a biscuit as the base instead of an english muffin. I ended up eating the salmon and eggs and leaving the biscuit behind. I swapped out my home fries for the asiago grits but they were too cheesy and lumpy. My friend got the red velvet waffle and she said the waffle itself wasn't very flavorful but there was a ton of chocolate sauce on top.   Overall, I wouldn't return for the brunch."}
{"text":"360 Bistro was a very good choice. We had the Portobello Frites which were quite tasty. The Top Shelf Margarita pizza and CBR pizza were great choices. Our glasses were never empty and Christopher was knowledgeable. We are very pleased for coming."}
{"text":"Went here for weekday lunch. They had a sign out front for $7.99 lunch menu so a co-worker and I thought we would give it a try. The lunch menu consists of maybe 5-6 sandwiches and spaghetti, it has no salads. The only vegetarian option was the spaghetti, which I didn't want, so I ordered off the regular menu.   My friend ordered the grilled chicken sandwich from the lunch menu. All lunch menu items come with a choice of fries or salad but the server informed us they were out of fries. It is crazy to be out of fries for lunch. They have a number of other sides but she was only offered mashed potatoes or salad and opted for the salad. The salad looked to be mostly iceburg lettuce. The salad was served before the sandwich.  When her sandwich came out the chicken looked pretty good but the lettuce on the sandwich was one small piece of white iceburg. The sandwich had no condiments on it or with it and she had to request some mayo which took forever for the server to retrieve.   I ordered the portabello mushroom sandwich ($10). It was pretty good but also had no condiments and didn't come with any lettuce, tomato, or anything. For my side I ordered the \"award winning\" mac & cheese and the server informed me this is $1 upcharge, which is not stated on the menu. The mac & cheese was good.  I see the other reviews for this place are mostly very good so maybe for dinner it is better. The pizzas sounded good but I didn't see anyone eating one for lunch.  It is nice to have a locally owned option amidst the chains in the University Area and I wish them luck."}
{"text":"2.5 stars  We were at  TGIF sad about the end of unlimited apps, saw 360 bistro across the street and figured we'd give it a shot since it had the #1 rated Mac n cheese in the city. To add to our woes, our waiter told us they don't serve the award winning Mac n cheese due to the updated menu brought on by new management. I feel like that was a huge mistake on management's part. The new menu was small and unimpressive by my standards though they did have great 50% off wine specials on Wednesdays.   We ordered the garlic knots to start and was disappointed by the size, they should give at least double that portion. The flavor was good despite being a little oily.  My boyfriend and I split the Brooklyn because we love garlic sauce... Caught out eye right away. There was also a 2 for $20 special on pizzas FYI, seemed like the only great deal to me. Sadly, our Brooklyn was extremely bland even though it was generously topped with mozzarella and tomatoes. I literally had to douse it was salt and chillies.   On the plus side, they had a great Trivia game going.. Was entertaining. The waiter and manager were polite. Got a $3.25 glass of moscato. I Was just hoping the food would be more impressive."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential and unfortunately isn't tapping into it. For a prime location in university city I expected it to be busy on a Saturday night. To my surprise it had three tables seated. I was more so embarrassed because I had made a reservation. The service was good for the most part. Our server was in training but had a good understanding of what she was doing. They are privileged to have the best bartender in the city on their staff Daniel L.   In terms of the food, it took more time than I would have expected for it to come out. I ordered a pizza and found myself slightly underwhelmed. Most of my toppings seemed to be thrown on after it came out of the oven, so my veggies were still raw. My husband got a panini which he ended up eating the next day (he filled up on apps) but said it was really good.   I think with some more advertising and a broader menu this place could be a big hit. I will say, around 10 pm Saturday nights it turns into somewhat of a lounge and the atmosphere is pretty grown and sexy....I believe that's how the kids call it these days. Hopefully this place gets busier"}
{"text":"First time going and was very excited since I'd heard so many wonderful things about it. Weeeell, apparently Tuesdays are not the day to go.  They were out of a lot of things such as the coconut shrimp and the food was not that tasty. I ended up getting the Chicken Marsala at the suggestion of the waiter and unfortunately, I was not impressed. The sauce was a little too sweet for my taste, not at all like I'm used to with other Marsala sauces. I  only ate about half of it and didn't want to take the rest home altho the garlic potatoes were good. My friends both ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo and we're also underwhelmed. The Alfredo sauce was so thick it looked like mayo and one friend had to actually send hers back. I reluctantly ordered dessert hoping to taste something that lived up to the hype I've heard and read about.  After being told they no longer serve the chocolate lava cake, I decided to get the 5 layer chocolate cake, and it was pretty good...I actually wanted to bring the rest home. Both friends also enjoyed their desserts, tiramisu and key lime pie. We had the fried mozzarella for an appetizer which was nice. I'll give it another try on a day other than Tuesday and see how it goes. Fingers crossed for a better experience."}
{"text":"Lunch time 12:30pm.  About 20 people.  Brick pizza and the bar is what stands out, you can see into the kitchen.  Deliveries were being made through the side door and taken into the kitchen area.  Tables have white tablecloths, but then they put cheap paper on it ( like Macaroni Grill).  I went here wanting to try the shrimp and grits and chicken and waffles as a fellow yelper posted.  Nope.  They do not make anymore the waitress said.  So, I decided on crab cakes, potatoes and broccoli $17, sweet tea $2.50.  No bread while waiting about 10 minutes for food.  Food arrived hot, but, broccoli pieces were large I had to cut them all to fit in my mouth.  AND the crab cakes looked like one was homemade (small)  and one was frozen (large) taste differently as well.  Small homemade one tasted better.  Not impressed.  I may give them another try but I will not the spread the word of this new place based on first visit."}
