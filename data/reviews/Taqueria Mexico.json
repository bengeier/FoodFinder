{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I've had in Charlotte since moving here from California. Having lived in LA, I have very high standards as far as Mexican food is concerned. Their staff is very friendly and greet you as soon as you come in. I've had their asada, carnitas and chorizo tacos and they're okay. Their chile rojo is pretty good, it's also really spicy so if you can't take heat I'd stay away from that. Their chile verde is okay. I had their chile rojo wet burrito and it was pretty good as well. I was hesitant after reading all the mixed reviews but decided to give them a try. Just as everyone else says, don't be fooled by the location of the place. It's in a small strip mall and you can possibly miss it but overall it's good. I'll be returning to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and they bring chips with THREE types of salsa to the table when you dine in. The decor is pretty kitschy and the restaurant is a part of a sketchy strip mall, but the food and killer staff more than makes up for it. Also, a great value for the low price."}
{"text":"This one is a solid two and a half But I clicked three. There are a few much more excellent authentic Mexican eateries here in Charlotte IMO. So after reading reviews here on yelp, this one was not a wow. Far from it.   First off the place is dirty. EWWWW.   The two times we went, there were other tables in there, so according to that and the other reviews here, fans do exist but don't count me in.  I mean, it was not the worst but that's about all I can say.   The prices are not that big but neither are the portions.   The overall taste, was about three stars says A-OK. Price was on par with portion-minimal, so three stars. Decor, was about three stars only cause I like the colorful tables but the dirt and dust and cobwebs we observed knocked it down. Service was? Huh? Nothing memorable."}
{"text":"The wet burritos and horchatas are delicious.  The fajitas left us desiring more but overall good."}
{"text":"I've been looking for my go-to mexican place in Charlotte and this is officially it. The wet burrito was amazing and the rice and beans were great. It was affordable, also. I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Our family favorite for over 23 years! Consistent quality food and service. Cerviche is excellent!"}
{"text":"Very good, authentic-as-it-gets-in-a-Charlotte-restaurant mexican food.  The staff is friendly and attentive and the prices are very reasonable.  Everything I've had there has been really good, especially their mole de pollo, which is a bench mark for good mexican cuisine.  When you finish you go to the counter to pay and they total up your bill there, which is a bit weird if you pay in cash since you have to double back to the table to leave a tip, but I guess that's just part of the charm."}
{"text":"Every time I think of this place I smile.       I eat here at least twice a month and am always satisfied. It has a very family oriented feel. There is certainly no frills and that's what is great. Consistent service, good food, and a relaxed atmosphere will bring you back."}
{"text":"Small establishment with booths and tables that appear to be well maintained and clean. Highly recommend this place because food is pretty close to what I'm used to back in my hometown. Delicious and well priced."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time based on the yelp reviews, was looking for a good local mexican place to satisfy my mexican food craving. The restaurant is in a small strip mall, and has a small authentic vibe. The two waitresses were very nice, and took our drink order immediately. I got the wet chicken burrito, and my boyfriend got 3 tacos and guacamole. Just as a tip, the guac is basic without any tomatoes, onions, or peppers in it, but still very good. The wet burrito has amazing, I only ate about half and was full. My boyfriend enjoyed his tacos very much. The prices cannot be beat either! The only grip I have is after the waitress took our plates away, she didn't bring the check or instruct us how to pay. We sat there for about 10 minutes then finally asked about it, and you have to go to the register at the front to get your check and pay. Not a huge deal, just would have been nice to be told that.  Overall good experience with authentic mexican food!"}
{"text":"I had a really hard time deciding between 3 and 4 stars here.  The atmosphere, staff, and food are exactly what I'd expect from an authentic Mexican joint.  I currently smell like I was fried in a basket of chips...so...sounds about right.  The positives:  Nice beef burrito, good tasting tomale, English/Spanish barrier (a good thing in my book), the smell of the place, the decor, and how busy it was.  The negatives:  The cheese enchilada, the salsas, the chips were not fresh, and the enchilada sauce is from a bag or can.  Sounds like alot of positives AND negatives huh?  Overall it's good.  This is what Mexican food is supposed to taste like.  Just like real New York pizza is not going to the be the best you've ever eaten.  It is what it is.  I'd definitely go back to Taqueria again.    I think I'm going to have to test drive their Carnitas or Menudo before I decide to add another star...but I'll be back."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall spot from the outside but the food was delicious!!! I had the shrimp and beef fajitas and my lady had the burrito which was also very tasty. It was definitely real Mexican food. Our waitress was cool but there was one lady who looked evil and kept staring at us wanting us to leave right after we ate. We were chatting after a wonderful dinner and she just kept giving us that evil look.. So I went up to pay and she still kept staring so we just ended up leaving. I would def go back again cause the food was that good. But the lady needs to lose her attitude or she will lose customers.   I'm giving it a 3 because of the lady's attitude. She was very rude and not polite at all."}
{"text":"The tacos are excellent. Had the asada and al pastor. Also had the beef wet burrito. The salsa is fresh, hot and good. The service is very good and the place is clean as a whistle.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The Best Mexican food in Charlotte bar none.  I had the Chimichanga and it was Out of the World."}
{"text":"This is not an upscale Mexican restaurant, hole in the wall kind of place but don't get fooled by its appearance. This is the place where you get the best chicken tacos ever. Simple tacos on small fresh made soft tortilla, chicken, onions and lime. Add fresh cilantro and you are in food heaven. How much does it cost? Mind blowing $1.75 per taco. The servers are very friendly. The complimentary chips and salsa is too good. Today we tried sopes... Mmmmmm goodness!! Their wet burrito are super too. All in all, not a single item we tried on the menu so far is bad. Oh and how can I end the review without mentioning their home made flan... :-)"}
{"text":"I was very happy to be back here today. It's been too long for sure! As promised, I grabbed myself one of the wet burritos from the menu and it was just as delicious as everyone else has proclaimed. I went with the burrito with the rice and beans on the outside. The sauce over the top was great and I am a huge fan of the three salsas they provide. I was sure to load my burrito up with the hottest one they provide. Really really happy with the quality, price and service here. I'm quite sure I won't be able to stay away from this place for very long!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting to find an authentic Mexican restaurant since I moved to Charlotte. Came here for taco Tuesday. It did not disappoint. My friend and I sat at the bar. We shared the queso con chorizo, each had some tacos and then split flan. We also had chips and salsa. Everything was delicious!   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Don't let the dinky strip-mall locale scare you off.  Waiting inside for you are delicious burritos, tacos, salsas and everything in between.  A friend brought me here once and I would come here twice a week if it weren't so far from my home.  Instead, it has become something to look forward to, which is just fine by me.  Yes, it's the kind of place worthy of a special trip.  My favorite is the \"wet\" chorizo burrito and the little asada tacos.  Very authentic and totally yummers.  Service is always prompt and friendly, and they also serve three different salsas with their chips, giving a good variety between people who love spicy salsa and people (wussies) who can't handle too much heat (like me).    Definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Judge this book by it's cover at your own peril!  It's not pretty on the outside.  It's not pretty on the inside.  Once you put your knife and fork to work, you will be planning what to order the next time you return!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. Ordered margaritas and there was no flavor or tequila. The glass looked pretty... that's about all it had going for it. Ordered chicken enchiladas and the chicken tasted like it's been cooked and recooked day after day.. rubbery, very dark in color and tasted horrible. My husband ordered a combo and his chicken also was not edible. Management took off my meal and my husbands margarita.. I drank mine down as I had to get rid of the taste of chicken.  Won't be visiting here again.."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos in Charlotte.  Try the Al Pastor, a spicy pork taco.  I've also had the Pollo soup and the scrabbled eggs with Chorizo.  If you want authentic, then this is it.   The service is always great too.  All the ladies speak great English so you won't feel intimidated.  And they are really polite.    So if you're in the area and you want some good, scratch that... GREAT Mexican food then come check this place out."}
{"text":"I ordered food here to go and was impressed!   The food was freshly prepared and the portion sizes were huge!   Queso is delish! And they have really good chips! Perfect for dipping.   The shrimp quesadilla was also very good- and they weren't skimpy with the shrimp!   Veggie and Bean Wet Burrito was really filling and packed with flavor.   I'd recommend everything I tried and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Ok, honestly, I really wanted to like this place. The location was promising as most of the best Mexican food is found in hole in the wall strip malls. The ambiance inside was promising, with string lights hung from the ceiling and authentic tables and chairs. As soon as we walked in, what seemed to be one of the two owners mentioned in previous reviews sat us at a booth amidst large crowds of other patrons. Then we wait... and wait... and wait. It literally took us flagging down our hostess to get drinks, chips, and salsa. We received our drinks and two salsas, a red and a verde. Ten minutes later, we ordered. Two of us got a wet burrito. One with beef and another with chorizo, served with rice and beans. One got the carnitas. Cue the 45 minute wait for our food (the party of 15 behind us didn't help, I'm understanding). So we get our plates and the \"wet burrito\" is sitting in a grease flavored red liquid... don't recommend. Carnita pork slab was DRY. The rice was hardly authentic, I'm talking like plain Jane rice. So much for my hopes and dreams of delicious Mexican food"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Charlotte.  Taqueria Mexico is a hidden gem of Charlotte. Authentic and fresh food, a prompt and friendly staff, and a tastefully decorated restaurant combine to create an experience well worth your while.  Prices are very reasonable and it's family friendly too."}
{"text":"Delicious fajitas, fresh corn tortillas and corn chips. Inexpensive lunch-would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Our favorite mexican joint in Charlotte. Good flavor and great prices. My wife and I can eat, have a few beers and walk out for $25. Not too bad."}
{"text":"OMGosh!!! This is my go-to place to go totally authentic low price Mexican diner food. Use to go here a couple of times a week for lunch. Great prices and fresh ingredients.  The staff is super friendly and they always give me what I ask for when I customize their dishes.  Best wet burritos around. It's hard for me to order anything else because I always want the chicken wet burritos (it is huge).  Everything I've ever had is super here.  Give it a go - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"After six years+ in Houston, we never expected to find muy authentico Mexican in a white bread town like Charlotte.  Fresh fresh fresh.  Not for those who only eat fancy ersatz Mexican, all gussied up for gringos.  This is the real thing.   Try to tacos - fresh, honest, with onions, cilantro and lime.  The salsas - we haven't found anything close since we left Charlotte.  Always three different kinds, each made fresh and served so you can mix and match.  The enchiladas con salsa verde are amazing.  The tomatillo sauce is prepared so you can taste the citrusy tomatillos, not just the heat.  My husband tells me the margaritas are killer - I stick to Corona Light and drive.  We discovered the place many years ago, when it was a hole in the wall in the same location.  Since then, the owners have changed the decor, bright bright colors on the tables and chairs.  Optical illusion prints.  Mexican soaps and soccer on the tvs.  Each year we see more and more gringos, but the local Hispanic community is always there in force.  Can't say enough about this truly family, muy authentico taqueria.  We've moved to Memphis now and while this city is awash in great eats, not one Mexican restaurant comes close.  If you're in Charlotte and know real Mexican food, stop by.  You'll be welcomed, well fed and be reminded of wherever you're from that taught you about real Mexican food."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years, through the second owner. Authentic Mexican food at a very reasonable price.  Would have rated it higher but on my last visit the sanitation grade has dropped to 91."}
{"text":"not going back. been eating here for 10+ years. new ownership recently. standards continue to drop, prices went up and to cap it all they switched to pepsi. no-go no more"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the wet burrito - the best I've had in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Delicious, inexpensive Mexican food. I especially enjoyed the tamal (filled with pork) and the refried beans, which were some of the best I've ever eaten. The rice and enchilada were standard, but still tasty. The three salsas that were served at the beginning were extremely delicious, and we got a second basket of chips after we finished our meal just to enjoy the trio further."}
{"text":"The best tacos de lengua ( cow tongue )in the city !!! Love it !! They renovated the place with some string lights hanging from the ceiling !!!"}
{"text":"I got takeout from here the other day. It was awesome. Reminded me of the street tacos I would get in the Mission in San Francisco. I got a Cabeza taco and and Al Pastor taco. Both were under two dollars and delicious. They included chips, salsa, hot sauce, and limes with my to go food. All for under five dollars. Can't beat that. I'm going back for lunch today."}
{"text":"First time for lunch yesterday and loved it. Simple and fresh ingredients and a very friendly and attentive staff. Very authentic fare. Will return often."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go back even if the food was free.  Underseasoned. Rice was bland, beans are average. Nothing I can't make myself.  I got take out and literally watched everything get zapped in the microwave. Tamales, rice, everything besides the soup. Literally. I was so turned off. They did it right in front of me with no shame. You can see straight into the kitchen. When I got home, my order was wrong. This place is so bad, it's a joke. Would never recommend or even give them a second chance  Save yourself the trip, trust me."}
{"text":"A restaurant experience is defined by service. The lady helping us was a hot mess. This is an airport location, people are in a hurry! It should not take over 30 mins to get your food. To top it off when we said we were leaving her response was OK. That's it, no apology, no I'll pack your food up...nothing!"}
{"text":"Food was okay ... There was never anyone checking on me  to see if I needed anything like a napkin, sauce or a refill of drink ... Restaurant is nice ... Average I would say on this visit ... Nothing special about it .    The salsa was extremely watery and the Taquitas were very dry ... Can't comment on much more as I never got a chance to order anything else as the waitstaff was non-existent ...  I came I ate I left ... Not bad but lots of room for improvement if I was to come back for more ... I can get (  ignored ) that kinda service at home ... Disappointed"}
{"text":"Hola, comida deliciosa! Talk about generous portions, affordable prices, and great flavor...yes, please!   After reading previous reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect. However, in my experience the place was very clean. In fact, the servers were cleaning off tables when we entered and when we were leaving they were wiping down the menus. They stayed busy cleaning. Extra plus in my book.   The portions must have changed too. Like I mentioned, they were good sized and I left with a too-full belly. The veggie burrito was huge and around $5...for dinner! The salsas were good, chips fresh, and I really liked the individual salsa cups with a mini jar to pour your own.   I really liked the bright colors and the art on the booths; it made the ambiance cheerful. The service was very friendly too. Need to catch up on a novela? It's playing in the corner. If you are in need of some chicle, you're in luck, they have that at the cash register. Tip: No rush to pay, just go to the register when you're ready.   What a difference a year makes! I think this place has turned things around and I plan to return."}
{"text":"Headed down burrito alley and I finally got Taqueria Mexico.  Inside the booths and the artwork have some Mexican flair.  Everyone at the counter is as pleasant can be and will always greet you.  Chips and multiple salsas are brought out to you when you arrive. The wet burritos are about the size of a football and are damn good.  Its like 2 meals for $6. The tacos ( especially the al pastor) and solid and come with extra sides.  For the price point this place is bomb"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years. This is real Mexican food. Let me give you a couple of pointers...  Taqueria means Taco Stand. So order tacos!  They have had real soft corn tortilla tacos since they opened. I find it interesting that lots of restaurants are adding these to their menu now. I like the steak tacos the best. Tacos asada! Also... They have margaritas now!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic mexican food.  I ordered the tacos al pastor, tacos de cabeza, tacos de lengua, and tacos tripita with an icy horchata.  The horchata came in a huge glass and was delicious.  The tacos were perfect."}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious every time & the staff is always super nice! An amazing value! So glad we found them!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. You won't go wrong here. The tacos are superb and the salsa tasty. You get three types of salsa ranging from mild to hot and the hot is picante! Be careful if you don't like it hot, but if you do, you won't be disappointed. A very pleasant place and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The only reason I don't frequent this authentic little Mexican joint more often is because it's located on the other side of town. Otherwise I would drop by weekly.  First of all, let me say that you would never guess that such a beautifully done interior existed based upon it's nondescript facade. The booths are hand carved and beautifully painted. More importantly, they are comfortable. The service that we experienced was exemplary... both friendly and attentive.  We shared the wet burrito and several authentic tacos which means your meat, onions and cilantro only, on a soft flour tortilla. Everything was delicious and servings were enormous. Chips and salsa were very good too. Pricing is normal but you get a lot for your money.  Most Charlotte Mexican restaurants serve the same generic fare and and most are pretty good; however, this is the only one so far that I give a Gotta Try."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place. The staff is great. The food authentic. I am Mexican from LA. I know what I am talking about. If you don't like it then you probably think Taco Bell is Mexican food. The staff is wonderful. I love the salsa. News flash people... you CAN mix them to get the right consistency that's good to you. I always get the chili verde burrito spicy. So delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Charlotte. It's a little hole in the wall with big flavors. The wet burrito is amazing and filling, and makes you want to still eat more. Wish the guac was a little more flavorful, but everything else makes you forget about it."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant. My co-worker called in the order because she speaks Spanish and because we had a big order it was just easier. I had a veggie wet burrito and I was REALLY good. I love there red sauce, its lite. But when they say WET it's really wet lol.  The down size is I paid $7.49 for a platter and it only come with the burrito only"}
{"text":"I tried this place after reading the reviews and it helped that it was close to my apartment. We both got chimichangas (one beef/steak and chicken) but they were a lot different than what we are used to. First, the chicken was not shredded, which again is what we are accustom to, it was chopped. Then the rice and beans were very small portioned. Lastly, there was no cheese on top of the chimichanga. Also, the salsa was just tomato juice. The overall taste of the meal was not good. My boyfriend did not enjoy his meal he threw it away :( as for me I paid for dinner so I suffered through it to get my money's worth. Overall this was a bad experience. We won't go back here."}
{"text":"Low prices and excellent, authentic Mexican food.  Festive chairs, seats, and tables painted with vibrant colors add to the fun atmosphere.  Get a few tacos and a wet burrito.  Enjoy the various hot sauces and salsas.  Friendly waitstaff.  Ask for \"Donald\" if you remember!  He's the best!"}
{"text":"Hubs and I were craving mexican to celebrate our one year anniversary and I'm so happy I came across this place on Yelp. The first place we wanted to go was closed for Memorial day so this was technically our second choice. When we pulled up, there was plywood on the door where the glass had been broken. That almost deterred us looking super sketch, but we decided to try it anyway.  First, we ordered a strawberry margarita and it was HUGE and also delicious. We ended up sharing it because it was so much! The chips and salsa kept coming while we waited for our food. I ordered a burrito which was jam packed with meat, rice, beans and avocado and Hubs ordered fajitas. He had so much meat, peppers and onions, it looked like a double order. The owner even came over and introduced himself and told us a little about the place before we left. Definitely worth the money and getting past the sketchy exterior!"}
{"text":"Yummy! My friend brought me here for lunch and our food and service were both really good! When we sat down (seat yourself) we were immediately greeted with a fresh basket of chips and salsa. Green and red salsas, basic but yummy. For lunch I had a delicious and rich, cinnamon horchata and chicken wet burrito and my friend had the fish. We shared churros for dessert. My burrito was delicious and huge, very fulfilling. I preferred shredded chicken but I don't think that was an option here. His fish scared me because it was an actual fish lol but he said it was fresh and tasteful and was served with a large plate of rice and beans. The churros came in a serving of 6 and were served warm with chocolate drizzle on them.   The waitress was friendly, the food came quick and it was delicious. I enjoyed this place and will definitely try to come back one day.   Note: originally I was hoping they had more of a lunch menu, but to be honest the prices are pretty cheap in the first place a lunch menu isn't really necessary. My huge burrito was only $8 anyways."}
{"text":"Try the choriso cheese dip- so good! Also very good carnitas y al pastor. Margaritas are pretty good too. Great friendly service. Don't be scared away by the the nighborhood or exterior of the strip mall- this place has great authentic style Mexican food!"}
{"text":"TL;DR: Average Mexican spot on South Blvd.    Food - 3/5 - I had three different tacos (pork, al pastor, and chorizo) and my wife had two hard tacos and an enchilada.  The tacos were relatively simple mostly just the meat plus a little onion and cilantro (which was a nice addition).  The pork taco was definitely on the drier side and wasn't that great.  It almost tasted like pork I would have in the fridge for two or three days.  The al pastor and chorizo were both tasty.  It was $1.99/taco which I thought was fair.  As with any legit mexican place, you get a basket of chips which came with green and red salsa.  Both were fantastic!    Decor - 4.5/5 - This place isn't fancy, but it's colorful and fun and I enjoyed it.  Couple of TVs were a nice and unobtrusive addition.  Service - 3/5 - On the slower side, but very friendly.  I would come here again, but with so many other places on South Blvd., it'll probably be awhile."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this. For years this has been the absolute best authentic brick and mortar taco joint in Charlotte. No more. It appears the ownership has changed and the standards have gone with it. The tacos Al pastor are now more Americanized, the chicken tacos were very bland, the pico they used to have has been replaced with some bland salsa you might find at a shopping center Mexican restaurant.   There are now two guys in the kitchen who had some vulgar conversations, and the whole feel of the place has changed. The tacos are still decent, but the lack of attention to detail has dropped them off the top of my list. I will now put tacos la hidalguense on Little Rock in the #1 spot, but it's technically a taco cart.  It's really a shame. I've probably eaten here 50-75 times over the last 6 years. I am the Duke of this place, by far. We may not be back of changes aren't made."}
{"text":"Great food. Our kid ate without needing reminding. So that says a lot. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is my first review I have ever left on Yelp and felt I absolutely had to leave one for this place. I am from a Mexican American background and can say this is the real deal. A hole in the wall for sure but I can honestly say any friends or family that come visit will be coming to this place with me. The ceviche and tacos had some of the best flavors I have tasted since my mom's kitchen. The service was great, the price was more than reasonable, and I will be a regular at this place henceforth. If you are looking for great AUTHENTIC Mexican food at a great price look no further."}
{"text":"The waitress seems to be too preoccupied at the counter. The food was Okay. Yet I won't be back."}
{"text":"I just moved to charlotte from southern California, a Mexican food mecca, a few months ago and this has been the closest thing to awesome Mexican food I have had. I was super hungry and got 3 tacos and a torta. All super good, highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite spots to hit off of South Blvd in South Clt.  Food is delicious or at least everything that I've had from here has been. Secret menu on the weekends has Ecuadorian food which is spot on. My favorite dish has a variety of items from this menu called La Bandera but you better bring your appetite."}
{"text":"If your looking for authentic food this is the place to go to! It is not super fancy but the people who work here are very warm and friendly! I was brought warm chips and three different types of salsas that were very good! I ordered the bean wet burrito it was amazing!!! It was stuffed with refried beans, rice, cilantro, and onions, topped off with a good Red sauce and cheese and sour cream! I will definitely be back to this place !!!"}
{"text":"We had moved from California two months earlier and were craving an authentic Mexican food experience.  Upon pulling into the parking lot, we had high hopes based on the location - we're convinced that the tastiness of Mexican food is directly correlated to the dodginess of its location.  Taqueria Mexico is located in an ugly little strip mall where the biggest store sells auto parts - PERFECT.  Sadly, the location belied the actual food experience.  My husband had the wet deluxe burrito; since I'm pregnant, I had to forgo my favorite huevos rancheros for a mushroom quesadilla.  I also ordered a side of rice and beans to share with our toddler, since for some reason that particular quesadilla did not come with it (other quesadillas did, though).  My husband doesn't talk too much about his food, but 95 percent of the time whatever he is eating is \"AMAZING.\"  I have literally never seen him dislike Mexican food, and we've been to a great number of taquerias together.  Burritos are either \"amazing\" or \"that was the best burrito I've ever had.\"  He declared his burrito here \"not that great.\"  I'll be a little more descriptive about my quesadilla.  It was terrible.  The mushrooms were canned, and I absolutely hate canned mushrooms.  You really can tell, people.  The cheese - I don't even know if it actually had cheese.  The \"cheese\" filling had the texture of watered-down sour cream and did not act like any cheese I've seen, ever.  There was what was supposed to be guacamole on the side, and I really do not think it was guacamole.  It was almost translucent, and bore no resemblance to any guac I have ever seen.  It did not taste at all like avocado.  The beans were refried, and they were so intensely salty I didn't even want my kid to eat them.  Luckily he didn't like them.  After reading all the good reviews I was surprised to have such a bad meal here.  Maybe it was an off day, or maybe our expectations are just too high after so much amazing California Mexican food.  We're hoping to find a good equivalent someday, but will keep looking."}
{"text":"We've gotten takeout here before, but it was my first time for a sit-down meal.  GREAT!  No complaints, great food, pleasant service, reasonable prices, and a huge variety, some things I haven't seen on other Mexican menus before.  What's not to love?   This may be my go-to place for Mexican for awhile as I want to try so many things on the menu."}
{"text":"Health ratings are back up. Food is great again. So happy that my favorite Mexican restaurant has turned it around!"}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews I wanted to give this a try.  I much prefer the authentic Mexican restaurants to the local upscale and chain versions.    I was in the mood for a chile relleno and ordered that immediately.  The servers were both very friendly and efficient and I give them 5 stars.   The chips and salsa were fine, 4 stars.   The chile rellenos ... not so great.  There was a really bad taste permeating the chile relleno.  And as another reviewer mentioned, the beans and rice were excessively salty.   I may give another try to try something different."}
{"text":"It seems there has been a change in management and they have made the place worse, not better. We come here for authentic Mexican tacos, but our last visit may just be that. The food was bland and the taco recipes have become americanized (i.e. pinapple on tacos al pastor). The guys in the kitchen were having a completely inappropriate conversation. If they are the owners/new managers, I don't need to hear that your friend snorts adderall when he runs out of coke."}
{"text":"Taqueria Mexico is a hole in the wall nowhere near anything I usually frequent in Charlotte, but it's a top-notch find.  I'd say it's the best authentic mexican food in town, hands down.   The chile relleno is one of the best I've had anywhere. I also LOVE their huevos rancheros and huevos a la mexicana. So delicious!  Chips and salsa is plentiful, including a spicy and amazing tomatillo salsa. They also have a fire roasted smoked salsa, with a lot of heat and flavor (though, truth be told, I'm not a fan of smoked anything, so I stick with the salsa verde and the traditional tomato salsa).  Friendly staff, delicious home-made food. Really, you can't go wrong with anything here!!!"}
{"text":"I recently moved here from LA, so my mexican food standards are pretty high.  So far this is my favorite place in Charlotte, I come here every 1 or 2 months. The food is great and the prices are great.  Their salsas are fantastic, traditional mexican salsas  as good as any in LA, warning they are a little hot on the hot side, my husband loves them,  I always asked for mild and that is about the most heat I can handle. My only complaint is that their margaritas are weak, they need to work on them."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had since I lived in Tucson.  It is in an ugly little strip mall but that's just part of the charm.  My favorite is the wet burrito.  I highly recommend to anyone that likes authentic street corner Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite place in Charlotte to eat.   Growing up here I learned about this gem when I was in high school and it's always the first place I visit when I go home to visit.   Their chicken wet burrito is honestly my favorite meal in a restaurant....ever....  This is all after you eat at least a bowl of chips with their homemade pico de gallo which is also 10/10!!!!"}
{"text":"This place seems to be recommended by a few Yelpers so I decided to check it out on my lunch hour.  It is located in a small strip mall just north of Arrowood Rd.  Inside is relatively small but they make good use of the space.  The booths and tables are very colorful which helps brighten an otherwise boring decor.  I was greeted immediately and it's seat yourself here.  Once you are seated, someone comes with the complimentary chips and salsa.  As others have mentioned, their red salsa is quite watery and it is very mild.  The tomatillo salsa has a little kick to it.  The chips were decent.  I ordered the wet spinach burrito which was huge and filled with beans, rice, cheese, spinach and onions and covered with a red sauce.  It was ok.  Everything was a bit watery and the biggest flavor here was onion.  I am not sure if was the best introduction to the food here but I have recently been changing my diet and gave up meat for a while.  Perhaps there are better vegetarian items here or possibly a fish dish?  Anyway, the staff was very friendly here and food came out fast as it does with most Mexican places."}
{"text":"It's the small places that surprise you and this is one of those places.  If you are looking for REAL authentic Mexican food then you have come to the right place.  Yes, it's in a dingy strip mall along busy South Blvd., but don't let that stop you from coming here.  They are really friendly here, laid back, the service is fast, and most of all - the food is awesome.  Love the various salsa dips they serve with the tortilla chips.  There are some vegetarian options on their menu.  My favorite is the spinach wet burrito.  One unusual thing in this restaurant that I like is the wash sink that is outside the bathrooms.  It makes it hassle free to wash your hands.  I wish they had an outdoor patio, but in its current location that probably wouldn't work."}
{"text":"Taqueria Mexico is a refreshing little spot out South Boulevard serving up authentic, homey Mexican cuisine. We were pleasantly surprised with the trio of salsas, including a tasty green tomatillo along with as many chips as you can handle. The tacos are a real standout here, especially the shrimp taco. The wet burrito was very good as well, with a piquant sauce and melted cheese giving it that extra touch. The menu here is huge and I look forward to returning. The prices are also very reasonable and I'm sure the larger dishes would be enough for 2 to share. I am still on the lookout for additional great Mexican spots in Charlotte, but I'm glad to have added Taqueria Mexico to my regular rotation!"}
{"text":"I can't even believe this is the same place we are all reviewing. I went last Thursday with my co-workers and was promised authentic, cheap, hole-in the wall in all its glory Mexican food.  While I will say the decor and weight staff seemed authentic - the food tasted horrible.  We were given three salsas. The first was a bit too spicy for my taste ( I am a solid medium fan) , the second was normal salsa but nothing to rave about, and the third tasted like my co-worker said  \"a Bloody Mary on my chip\" basically entirely too watery.   I ordered a beef Chimichanga. Now a Chimichanga should be crispy as it is fried but this fell flat- it tasted like it was reheated in a microwave! The meat itself was scary looking (wasnt ground-or really shredded either just gross chunks ...yucky). 7 out of 8 of us made comments about the scary looking meat that filled our various Mexican entrees. I was told the chicken tasted like Chinese food -take that as you will. The rice and beans were the one part I did enjoy.  Overall my meal was $10 - and yucky. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"The Mexican food here is authentic and amazing. Super affordable with huge portions and nice large margaritas. I had chorizo con huevo and my husband had flutas and a taco. Everything was flavorful and hot. The waitress was super sweet and personable. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 15 years and still love my bean wet burritos! This place a small \"authentic\" Mexican restaurant where you can venture out of your usual arroz con pollo and try some more of the unusual Mexican dishes such as cabeza (head), lengua (tongue), and tripa (tripe). Not feeling that adventurous? That's okay.. they have lots more yummy dishes to try!"}
{"text":"Was hoping this place might be a lucky find, but was disappointed. Service was ok, but only ok. The real problem was lack of flavor in every dish. The salsas, served in tiny bowls, we're tasteless, watery, and boring. A couple we're hot, but that's it. Mains were embarrassing -- meaning we were embarrassed for the cooks. Doughy and wet, filled with dry chopped chicken. Beef filling was the same in another dish. It all tasted old. Rice (dry and crunchy) and beans (watery), were awful. We left most of our food on the table and got out of there. We all felt ripped off.  We'll keep searching for a really good Latin food restaurant. So far, no luck. As for this place, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican Restaurant in Charlotte. Eat here once or twice a month, definitely recommended. Authentic Mexican food, and very delicious!"}
{"text":"We were first timers because of Taco Tuesday promotion. Surprised at the authentic food. We'll be regulars. The Fajitas are spectacular."}
{"text":"My rating is 4.5 stars.  My friend and I picked up our other friend from Charlotte International Airport. We were all ready for dinner.   We did a Yelp search and this restaurant popped up. We wanted authentic Mexican food and this place was it.   I parked in front of the main doors. We walked in and immediately got a booth.   We hadn't seen one another in years. We started chatting up a storm. We got nacho chips or salsa and this spicy green sauce that was amazing!  Our server came back with our drinks. I had ordered a Diet Coke. I went ahead and ordered the beef burrito, chicken enchilada, and pork tanale meal. It came with rice and beans.   My meal was incredible. The food was flavourful. There was a lot of it. I got encouragement from one of my friends to polish everything. I don't have tamales often. I'm glad I got one! I also have a weakness for refried beans. So yummy!  I'd highly recommend coming here. The only minor detail preventing a perfect rating was service. We had asked for the bill and it took fifteen minutes to get it. The restaurant wasn't busy. It was minor for us, as we had plenty to talk about. However, if you are in a rush, you may want to go up to the don't and get someone's attention.   (129)"}
{"text":"very nice people the margaritas are great I got tipsy and they were cool with it.the food was great and I was impressed"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, lunch and dinner. I have not yet ventured off the tried and true Mexican menu. You know tacos, enchiladas, burritos, but I tried a sample of tongue (delicious!) and next time I may try the intestines (crunchy). They give you four different hot sauces with chips and Heinikens were only $3.50! The waitresses are very friendly and knowledgeable and willing to let you try before you buy. The only downside is the location, a nondescript stripmall on South Blvd. just north of Sharon Lakes. It's been here 23 years and there's a good reason."}
{"text":"Cute, colorful taqueria, great staff, large menu, decent veg selection. Service is very quick.   But the flavors seem hurried, not thought out - ranchero sauce is canned, diced tomatoes, little else - salsa verde lacks the tangy umph that is oh so important. Portions are surprisingly small for the money.   Like a number of taquerias along South, it seems this place is shooting for authentic Mex, and only achieving above-average Tex Mex. Burritos are good, but small, and smothered in what seems to be pureed ancho chili, yet somehow not spicy. I won't be trekking across town for a tiny plate of overpriced, under sauced chilaquiles again, but would come here if I was suffering such a craving for 'ritos that I couldn't stand a 15 minute drive."}
{"text":"I took the family there for lunch today and I have to say I was impressed.   This place servers authentic Mexican food, which I should clarify, does not mean Tex-Mex, which is what most Americans think of when they hear the term \"Mexican.\" They do have some non-traditional Mexican food, like the Mexican burger, but all-in-all, this is a great place to go if you are searching for authentic Mexican food.   They make all their own salsas and the food is incredibly fresh and delicious. Prices are not bad either."}
{"text":"Yum yum  one of the best taco joints in town! If your ever in south blvd area it's a good spot to check out."}
{"text":"Let's cut to the chase... this is the best Mexican in Charlotte! I started eating here about '92, and back then it was frequent I was the only English-speaking person in the place, and the wait-staff were Spanish-speaking only.  The Decor was terrible, but the food terrific. They've changed it all immensely, and now there's always a good mix of American and Hispanic customers.  The food quality is always, 100% fresh and exceptional, and while the Wait-staff is seldom overly friendly, they're always polite. Back in '98 I had the chance to eat at Tacqueria Mexico for dinner one night, got on a plane the next day to Arizona, and late that day was eating on the top of a mountain in Puerta Penasco, Mexico.  I can say with authority the food tasted exactly the same! So, if you're interested in truly authentic Mexican in Charlotte, you owe it to yourself to try this place! As mentioned by other reviewers, it's nothing special to look at, but it's what's inside that counts!"}
{"text":"For our monthly girls dinner, my (pregnant and Mexican food loving) friend picked this spot. She has an affinity for off-the-beaten path places and we were down to try something new. Overall, I'm glad we did.   I ordered a shrimp quesadilla. Two of my friends ordered different types of tacos and my other friend ordered the nachos. Our food came out as it was done so it was fresh. My quesadilla was really good - it was full of cheese and shrimp. I added some fresh squeezed lime and hot sauce, which made it even better. My only critique would be that I wish there had been some fresh vegetables in the quesadilla. Also, it is worth noting that the quesadilla doesn't come with sides. That's not a complaint but worth noting before you order.  My friends who ordered the tacos raved about how good they were. So good that my friend (who didn't really like her nachos) and I decided to get some for ourselves.  We did have a few issues with service (my friend ordered two tacos but they only brought her one, our check was not split correctly, my friend had to ask a few times for an item that she ordered) but, honestly, I think it was more indicative of a language barrier than poor service.   If you are wanting some authentic Mexican food, I would recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Tacos are best ive had in Charlotte! Authentic...taco Tuesday 1$ tacos can't beat it!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite authentic Mexican places in Charlotte.  So far, I've only tried the tacos, but they are outstanding.  Their shells are fresh and seem to taste better than taco shells at other places I've been.    I took my parents here recently for dinner, and the service was outstanding.  My dad asked for a special order of guacamole with no onions and they whipped up a batch just for him.  Later when he ordered his tacos, the server even remembered to leave the onions off without him asking!  I can't wait to go back and try some of their other items."}
{"text":"I was not a fan, I ordered the taco plate with different meats and they were all very dried out and tasteless. The rice tasted old and the refried beans were eh. My friend raves about this place and its not one I would go back to. Not sure if it was an off day or what, the resturant was not busy... our server never came back after the food came out... we had to go find somebody to give us the check."}
{"text":"This would be my personal favorite Tex-mex style restaurant in charlotte; however, the kitchen is contaminated with cheese. I understand the difficulty, but the language barrier makes it almost impossible to communicate a dairy allergy. Once they understood, the dishes still come out with cheese often. When they get it right, the food is excellent. I stopped coming here a while back due to the carelessness, though."}
{"text":"Service is not good. Food took forever to come. We ate almost the entire basket of chips. The salsa was so runny and came in a carafe. Salsa doesn't HAVE to be chunky so long as you dip a chip and can scoop it up. Salsa was so runny, it just made your chip soggy and never stayed on the chip. Think of the watery watercolor of salsas and you'll get my point.   My husband ordered a shrimp cocktail and never got a spoon to eat it. I ordered the Barbacoa plate (the special on Saturdays) and never got tortillas, cilantro, onion or lime. Barbacoa was served wet but meat was dry and chewy, instead of tender and juicy. It tasted old or reheated.  Beans were not flavorful, and something was off on them and couldn't eat them. I love beans and it takes a lot to put me off of them. The rice was bland. We didn't eat our food, we left it on the table, that's how not palatable it was!! Disappointed. NEVER Visit again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service.  Might have the appearance of nothing from the outside but definitely worth the trip in.  The chips and salsa are spot on ranging from mild to hot.  Plates are filled with generous portions and very authentic."}
{"text":"El servicio a caído mucho el servicio muy lento tardan más de media hora para servir la comida, ya no es lo mismo de antes al cambiar los propietarios todo se vino abajo,ponen de excusa que solo hay 2 cocineros siempre ha habido 2 y no hay pretexto"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how two years have passed without this place appearing on the work lunch radar, but better late than never, I suppose.   Located in the O'Reilly Auto Parts strip mall just north of Arrowood on South Blvd, the Taqueria is as bright inside as it is uninspiring and, well, strip mall-y on the outside. That brightness comes from the paint job on the booths and table & chairs, representing all the (particularly loud) shades of the rainbow. Cynics could say it cheapens the look of the place but, c'mon, you're in a super affordable taco joint! Have fun with it.   I will say, though, that one set of chairs has a giraffe and elephant painted on the back, and both of those animals stared at me the whole time I was eating. A little freaky because they're hanging out on the wrong continent and all. Also, a Mexican Star Search-esque show was on the TV; not my personal first (or second) choice, but it honestly enhanced the \"little neighborhood shop\" feel.   I paid $6 for lunch, including my tip, and thought it was terrific. I had two tacos - one chorizo and one spicy pork - both with cheese, lettuce, and tomato. Note, as they state on the menu, that those extra three toppings cost $0.50 per taco. I'm guessing if you get them without you just get lime and cilantro. For me, it was worth the try.   Both versions of the taco had meat had a fine-chop consistency - not ground, but still far smaller pieces than chopped BBQ pork shoulder, if that makes any sense. You get a choice of corn or flour tortillas, and I took the latter. They double-up on the corn ones to prevent the always depressing breakage.   Both the chorizo and spicy pork had a great mix of spice and were both bright and savory. I probably could've had a third but the free, warm nacho chips were were a good way to start (and finish) the meal.   They provide three salsas, and the one served in the largest amount (a carafe!) offered the only disappointment for the meal. It had cilantro and garlic pieces in it, but this stuff tasted like straight tomato juice. Perhaps I was doing it wrong, but trying it straight was not good at all. I hope it was just a bad batch lacking flavor, but heed this warning to avoid applying the red salsa to your food before trying a small sample.   Mixing it with the other two options provided a good topping for both my chips and tacos. There was a green salsa - far spicier than your common salsa verde - and a burnt orange one that was a little smokey and spicy, though less of both than you'd expect from a chipotle salsa.   In all, I am happy to have found a place that has fast, friendly service, unpretentious decor, and a menu with enough variety to allow me to try something new (and probably delicious) for a dozen more visits. With 10+ taco options, another 10 burritos, and a number of other plates I didn't take a lot of time to read for a lunch order, this place won't disappoint anyone in the mood for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food My wife had chicken mole and said it was the best she has ever had. I had enchiladas with green sauce that hit the spot. Nice friendly staff Clean little restaurant    Last night we went back I had lengua in salsa verde She had chicken mole They were both very good!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and reasonably priced. Extremely festive setting as u can see from my photo. Will come back when on this side of town. I had the mushroom burrito. It was GIGANTIC and only $8. I will have lunch tomorrow and then some. Flavorful cheese dip too."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price!  We were immediately welcomed the moment we walked in. Grab a menu and you seat yourself.   Small location but had such a great chill vibe. Waitress came by and took our drinks. Soon after our food orders and within moments the food came out hot and ready.   Fajitas and the taco salad were absolutely delicious. If nothing else give those a shot.   If you're looking for good food at a reasonable price you'll find it here."}
{"text":"This is THE best Mexican food in Charlotte.  It is extremely rare for me to never have a bad experience at a restaurant, so Taqueria Mexico is the exception rather than the rule.    It isn't fancy, they didn't waste a bunch of money on making it look pretty, they just cook great food, everyday.    I recommend the carnitas, either the plain or the red or the green.  Beware on the red however, it is spicy, it will creep up on you, it is basically their pork tips slow simmered in a spicy chipotle sauce.  They serve it with either corn or flour tortillas, with rice and beans and all the good stuff to make little tacos out of your platter.  I read on here that their portions aren't big.  Which is true, they are a normal size portion, which is smart, generally there is a lot of wasted rice and beans at a restaurant like this.  Personally I love the portion size, it is just enough to fill me and I don't feel stuffed like a relleno afterwards.  The burritos area great, but it's a burrito, you can get that anywhere, try something different when you are at an authentic place.  As for the bar, not too many options, but I'm usually busy drinking salsa at this place.  Just phenomenal.  It's that place where I can look at my wife and say \"I'm craving...\" and she will answer \"Taqueria.\"  Try it, if you don't like it you should probably stick to On the Border, or another pre-processed gringo-safe TexMex restaurant.  L'chaim!"}
{"text":"Not very good and definitely doesn't taste like authentic Mexican food . I'm a Cali native and this doesn't even come close to comparing ."}
{"text":"Got a wet chicken burrito, this means covered in sauce. Was okay. Free chips and salsa, salsa was watery. Sweet tea was yummy."}
