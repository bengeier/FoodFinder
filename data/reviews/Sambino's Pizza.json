{"text":"Staff was very nice, food was done on time and hot when I picked it up.  The food though, could be better.  My sub was wet, and tasted like a gas station made sub.  The pizza tasted like carnival or gas station pizza with more cheese.  Not very good.  Overall the experience was fine, but the food was not to my liking.  One detractor was that they do not have jalapenos, which for me is essential for pizza.  I'd much rather go to Marcos."}
{"text":"Excellent delivery service, ask for Myles"}
{"text":"I was on lunch break and came here to grab a bite. They were so attentive! They gave me the wifi password, which isn't advertised, so I could continue working! The prices were great too!"}
{"text":"Sambino's is the best pizza in Elyria. My husband and I recently moved to this community and, as pizza fanatics, have been trying lots of local pies to find our favorite. Once we had Sambino's we knew the search was over. Their wings are badass too. I've also had occasion recently to discover, in two unrelated venues, that Sambino's actively supports student athletes throughout Lorain County. This is great pizza from a company that gives back to the community. It's a win-win."}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza with relatively quick delivery. Only issue is they delivered to us knowing we're at a hotel, but included no napkins, silverware, etc"}
{"text":"My husband went to get a pizza from the Elyria location on Cleveland Street, and I happen to have a 6 year old son with Type 1 Diabetes. This is an autoimmune disorder and not caused by what he has eaten in the past. He does, however, need to know the number of carbs in EVERYTHING he eats so we can dose him correctly with insulin. To little insulin, he could die, too much insulin, he could die.   When picking up the pizza, my husband asked for nutritional information; specifically carbs per serving.  No one knew anything. No one knew how to find out. This is the FIRST place I have ever encountered that cannot give this type of information. It may not seem serious to most, but it can be very life threatening for my son.  I have now spent $22 for my child to not be able to eat. He is crushed. This diagnosis is hard enough as it is, on him.  Now we have to explain to him the best that we can, that he can't eat this pizza.   I am baffled that a place that pretty much serves carbs on a platter can't tell me what the carb count is for their pizza. Diabetics beware - no one in the restaurant will be able to help you. Stay away. This is the first place I have EVER encountered that can't help with carbohydrates per serving(s)"}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome. We have ordered all different kinds. Delivery is fast and all the people we have encountered have been very pleasant."}
{"text":"This is our second time ordering from Sambinos as we are new to the area. This place is AWESOME!! The pizza is delicious, the wings are perfectly cooked and the mild wing sauce is just about the best I have tasted! The pizza and wings arrive piping hot and the delivery drivers have been happy and friendly. This will definitely be our go to pizza place from now on!!"}
{"text":"Good place for take out. The pizza is pretty good and had no troubles with ordering or pick up. I will return here in the future i am very sure."}
{"text":"This place is terrible!! First they sent me spaghetti with sauce and no meatballs which I asked for ( Also asked for sauce on the side ( they didn't get that right) I asked for two salad dressings and got one (which I was willing to pay for extra). On top of this they sent no forks. The spaghetti taste worse than canned spaghettios and very processed under plain tomato paste (Don't waste $9.00 on that ..When I called to ask why no forks he replied \" Maybe you should have F-ing asked for a fork!\" The pizza was in a box smaller than  its size so they folded the sides to smash it in (gross) Trying to find a place where I can post a pic to back up my claim so I can help others. Most good reviews has to be from owners as bad as the service and food is here. Can't believe they have a business..Wonder how long it will last."}
