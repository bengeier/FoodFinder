{"text":"small, cozy place - good for a date or for you and your girlfriend to catch up. Good cocktails and ambiance.  The bread pudding is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Yes, it has the required \"funky atmosphere\" for the up and coming Leslieville area,,, though unfortunately the owner refused to turn the music down, just a little, and it was only 7pm.  We explained that the four of us wanted to converse without screaming across the table while we had dinner, we hadn't seen each other in quite a while.  She said that her patrons \"have come to expect the volume at this level\" and she wasn't going to change it. We explained to the short-sighted owner that it was only 7pm and we certainly didn't expect the volume to be lowered indefinitely or dramatically.  She refused.  The sad part is, she doesn't seem to realize that the \"funky, cool clientele\" that she's seeking usually have things to say to one another and like talking.  Making them scream over one another while constantly having to ask one another to repeat themselves is a huge drag.  Sure, turn the music up...no problem, but make it after 8 or 9pm once people have eaten, relaxed into the place and are ready to have some more drinks...we've already caught up for the most part so having to yell to talk a little bit later on, isn't so bad.  Note to owner, if you really want interesting, cool people in your place who have the money to spend on your over-priced pretentious food, then humour them a little and let them talk to one another while they eat...you can turn up the music a little later once they're drunk enough to appreciate the $8 bowl of peanuts you throw on the table..."}
{"text":"Great bar in Leslieville. Only been here one time, but all of the food was delicious.  Not a large beer selection, but some a good selection for the size. Nice cocktail and bourbon selection. Service was great, our server did miss a dish but more then made up for it by giving us shots.   We were told the menu changes often, which is always good and I will be happy to return to try some more food!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Went with my husband for our anniversary.  Had the charcuterie board and added devilled eggs.  Amazing flavours.  For our mains we shared the lamb shank and the special of the evening, which was a pig trotter.  Again, amazing flavours and well worth the price.  Throughout the evening I had several delicious cocktails and my husband had some nice craft beer. Our server was fantastic!!  Warm and also very funny.  The kitchen ended up sending us dessert on the house because they were impressed with how much of the trotter we ate.  What an awesome place!  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The weekly Yelp review of a few days ago rated the cocktail, \"Dark &Stormy\". My  new, favourite local cocktail destination in my neighbourhood,(Leslieville) has been  offering the best rendition of this drink, ever. Other than the local version in Bermuda,  using Gosling's over proof rum(not available in Canada) , Goods and Provisions has  taken this drink to new levels of deliciousness ! ! A must try for anyone stopping by  this very cool Bar/Resto. Bravo !   Arthur"}
{"text":"Great gnocchi and meatballs! The dark and stormys were very well prepared and the restaurant has a great atmosphere. I've been before and had a good experience but was very disappointed that I was charged full price for 2 drinks ordered just before the end of happy hour on a very quiet night. Definitely tainted the overall experience."}
{"text":"I'm still thinking about my dinner!  What a gem!  I'm a huge fan of roast duck and my dish was cooked to perfection and the accompaniment of celeriac mash & brussel sprouts was a great combination to counter balance the richness of the meat and maple sauce.  It was well worth the $23 and was more than filling.  My friend had the pulled pork platter and gave it the two thumbs up also.    The menu was quite small and mostly meat based (excluding the fish/seafood special) which I don't mind at all, but I wouldn't take any of my vegetarian friends here.  Our server suggested a bottle of red that paired perfectly and his service was excellent. Unfortunately, his counterpart that opened our wine hindered his stellar service and this is the reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5.   The wine was opened right over the middle of our table for 2, so our only option was to sit and watch him open the bottle that was right in our line of view.  As we watched, I was a bit grossed out to see his whole hand wrapped right around the opening and was left imagining what sort of horrible germs were now flowing into my glass with the wine.  The same server kept knocking me every time he walked past too, even though there seemed to be plenty of space for him to pass.  The no credit cards was also a surprise.   Definitely a fan though. I'll be back and will be bringing more friends (although never more than a table of 4 since it's such a cute little place)."}
{"text":"Not bad. Good atmosphere.  Good drinks. Lots of people and friendly service. Will return in the future with friends."}
{"text":"Wow. I can't believe the super high reviews for this place. Lemme break down my 3 for you.  Exhibit A) the atmosphere. It's good. Tiny and adorable so I liked that.  Exhibit B) service. It was pretty good.  She was attentive and gave drink recommendations.  Exhibit C and most important: the food. I was super disappointed personally. I got the po boy which was two super tiny bite sized \"sandwiches\" with one fried oyster in each which for 90% of the bite was bread and mayo. And it was overpriced which really aggrevated me. My husband's chicken and waffles was well executed and better bang for your buck that's for sure. Still pricy though.   I would come back for happy hour cause the drinks are well priced but the food is over priced in my opinion.  We went to another resto after and considered this our app."}
{"text":"Great food, ambience, service and drinks! New east end favorite for sure. Cocktails were very good, best sour and old fashioned I've had in quite some time.  We really enjoyed the oysters, tuna, greens and short ribs. We finished with the bone marrow which was tasty but not as good as Bar Isabel.  Overall, an excellent experience for a good price. Looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"Deliciousness. I've been twice. The first time, I started with the bone marrow & parsley salad. It was textbook perfect. The bone had been sliced in half lengthwise and grilled until everything was cooked, but not to the point that the fat has all melted and disappeared. The parsley salad cut the richness of the plate beautifully. After being so bad, I had to be good: had their grilled Pacific sardines with salad. Another dish that was done beautifully! The bones were nice and crispy and I ate them. Ate the cheeks off the head, but I confess, I didn't eat the whole head. Good salad accompanied the sardines.  Finished off, that first night, by deciding I needed some carbohydrates, so I ordered the duck fat frites. Yes, I'll be having those again, but I'm going to have to ration myself and only have them after I've either walked 10km or biked 30km. Very delicious.  Second time was tonight, a Thursday night. I got there before 7pm, and there was still lots of seating. Chose a Laily Vidal and a half-dozen oysters (Malpeques). The oysters were fresh and lovely and perfectly shucked -- no shell bits! Hooray. Some places make a big deal out of having a bazillion sauces for their oysters. These were served in simplicity: a couple of slices of lemon, some freshly grated horseradish, and a bottle of Tabasco if one wants some heat. Great buy: 6 for $13.00  Following that, I switched to Laily Cabernet/Merlot and had the terrine plate. Tonight it was a foie gras terrine -- I thought it tasted like apple, so I had the waiter enquire, and no, it wasn't calvados, it was Armagnac, so the sweet fruit flavour was grapes. Was accompanied by a nice fresh roll, marinated olives (nicoise, green, and some salt-cured) some house-preserved pickles (English pickled onions, pickled carrot) and a nice pile of shaved black Chevre from Quebec. They weren't sure where in Quebec the Chevre was from, but when I Google it, looks like it's this one: http://www.chasingthecheese.com/noir.htm .   Place was almost full by the time I left at 8pm, and the sound volume (and music) were getting loud.  Lighting is dark: I was reading \"Le Ventre de Paris\" on my iPod, and felt like I was in a French bistro lit by a few candles. Atmospherically it worked :-)  I'll be back, again and again. The menu switches, and there are always new things to try."}
{"text":"Wandered by at 5:30 looking for a place to stop for a drink. Lo and behold! Goods & Provisions was right in front of us, and they have half-price cocktails (selected cocktails, check the menu) and wine by the glass between 5:30 and 7pm. Perfect!  My sloe gin fizz was delightful, and the Penicillin was amazingly smoky. We also shared some duck fat fries because how can you not, and they were some of the best duck fat fries I've ever had. Perfect crispiness! We split the fries three ways and it was the perfect amount.  The bathrooms are cute, but super super tiny, so be warned."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday, not a busy evening. Placed an order for steak.  40-min later waitress told us it'd take another 12 min. 12 min later,  waitress told us it'd take yet another 15min and that we should cancel the order.  She also said 16oz was a large size that'd take time.  I doubt it has anything to do with the steak size, but just utter imcompetency  and 0 care."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar and watching the bartender hand-craft each drink with care and precision tells me cocktails are serious business here. And I'm right. A Dark and Stormy has the right amount of gingery bite. And the Manhattans are wicked good. My hands-down favourite menu item is the house-smoked ribs. They are salty and smokey and the slightly sweet BBQ sauce balances it all out. I often dream of these ribs. Great vibe--perfect spot for night out with friends or a cosy date."}
{"text":"Sweet spot in Leslieville to share some small plates in a relaxed intimate setting. The music on the night my date and I went was loud but made me nostalgic for the '80s and '90s - fun. The drinks are lovely - please do yourself a favour and try the Old Fascist, it's delightful. Servers were attentive, friendly and helpful.  Snacks and small plates are tasty - oysters, salmon croquettes, korean-style shortribs, duck rillettes, kimchi, frites! What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  We came for our first visit on my wife's birthday.  We had a very difficult time ordering because we had no idea how big the plates were and the waitress was useless when we asked (she couldn't tell us whether it is meant to be a tapas-style place or a traditional one-dish-per-diner restaurant.)  We ended up going with the jamon croquettes, pork belly and quail egg, duck rillette, crispy fried smelts, and tomato salad, and we finished with a ricotta cheesecake.  The amount of food was perfect for two people, and although the menu is small, each dish we ordered was amazing.  At most restaurants, when ordering a couple of tapas, I find there are one or two dishes I don't care for so much, but in this case I loved them all.  It would be impossible to pick a favourite: the smelt were breaded perfectly and very crispy, the tomato salad was juicy and refreshing, and the duck rillette was savory and creamy.  I will definitely be coming back again.  The only low point was the ricotta cheesecake, which was rather bland and served in a tiny portion. The restaurant has one step up to get in the door, for those with disabilities."}
{"text":"Wow...it just opened last week and last night was my first foray in but definitely not my last.  First off, the menu is definitely not your average pub fare.  There are no burgers or grilled chicken wraps on this menu so if that is your sort of thing keep walking.  The food is french, carefully prepared and presented and every mouthful is nothing short of amazing.  My friends and I shared the duck fat frites, perfectly cooked and seasoned with pepper and thyme and served with a spicy mayo dip.  We also shared the tacos, pork belly and cheek with kim chi on a mayo base with coriander and a slice of lime.  The tortillas were fresh.  It was wonderful.  Finally we split the terrine platter.  In retrospect we recalled it was supposed to include goats milk cheese which we didnt get but we were too busy stuffing ourselves with oxtail terrine, grainy mustard and gherkins on fresh baguette and devilled eggs to notice.    Our neighbours had the bone marrow which definitely looked worth a try given his expressions of enjoyment.  There were more pedestrian dishes such as pork chops and flatiron steak frites which looked equally well prepared as they were carried past our table.  Regretfully they sold out of the grilled sardines before we ordered.  I'll definitely be back.  I recommend getting there reasonably early though or seeing if they will take a reservation because by 7 on a Thursday night it was packed (only about 12 tables and bar seating and not really suitable for groups greater than 4)."}
{"text":"Popped into Goods & Provisions Friday night for a late dinner & drinks with a couple friends.  The space is gorgeous, dark wood, vintage portraits on the walls & great industrial vintage furniture. This place would co-exist well on Ossington or West Queen West.  Ordered drinks first, three Old-Fashions & a Manhattan ($12 each). Cocktails are expertly crafted and very good.  Two of us needed dinner, the other two just snacks. For the table we ordered the bone marrow appetizer ($9). One large bone, roasted perfectly with toasted bread and parsley salad. The boys got a dozen oysters, and Mark and I got Steak Frites. The steak of the night was flank steak. It was cooked well to medium rare, but when it hit our table, it was super rubbery. Not so great. The frites were delicious, seasoned very well.   After another round of drinks, our bill came and it was $190. Kinda steep for the little food we got and the drinks.   Will definitely go again, but probably just for cocktails."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here on a Friday evening over christmas. We were seated immediately and provided a overview of specials etc. I had the fish cakes which were excellent and washed down by a tasty glass of Tempranillo and later a delicious and zesty sloe gin fizz! I will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for a drink after dinner in the Leslieville area!!  It is quite small though, so not a place i'd bring the gang for a 30th birthday bash.    Drink and food menus are simple with enough to peak (or is it pique?) your interest.  Service is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Staff were great and my steak was perfect. My partner had the pork chop and was equally pleased. Definitely get there early if you don't want to wait in line. We were there Friday just before 7, 10 minutes later there was a waiting list for tables"}
{"text":"I like this place. Cocktails are regularly updated based on the season, good wines by glass {although a limited amount} small but decent beers. Really it's all about the liquor,and it's all good.   The food is good but it is a limited selection and not cheap. The oysters are definitely overpriced. We had the 16oz steak with mashed potatoes which was excellent but definitely a meal for 2. The charcuterie board was underwhelming taste-wise but a big portion - can't work out why there are no pickles or bread with it.   Atmosphere is intimate, a bit like a speak easy, but good for couples and small groups. It's pretty loud in there"}
{"text":"Great saloon-y feel.  Amazing rye-based cocktails (e.g., Sazerac and a refreshingly dry Manhattan).  I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and think this place is great. The food is delicious, with interesting dishes full of flavour (especially the seared duck breast dish) and the ingredients are high quality.   They make an amazing old fashioned (my favourite drink) so maybe that was what completely won me over.   It's a cute and tiny place with a wood interior and soft lighting. A good date spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Yet again the menu has changed (3 or 4th time it has been reinvented).  This was a favourite spot for food and well crafted cocktails. Not loving or even liking the new menu. The latest version is sharing plates. It would be extremely difficult to share many of the items if you had dislikes, allergies, intolerances etc. Steak was very fatty and came blue rare (was actually cold in the centre). We were not asked how we would have liked it prepared. Sardines were below average. Scallops were decent. Oysters were fresh and well presented.  Cocktails were good."}
{"text":"It was a slow Monday night, but the service was friendly, courteous and efficient. I had the steak frites, which was delicious, and my server, Corey (sorry if misspelled) suggested the perfect wine. I fell in love with the \"old fascist\" cocktail on my first visit, and the bartender (Brett?) did not disappoint. What a great evening! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"How cool is this place!?! The food was pretty incredible and the drinks to match! Went with my man...who is as much of a social butterfly as myself, so we hit it off great with the bartender (Bret) and his partner in crime (sorry, I don't remember her name, but she was great)! We started with...  ME: Some type of Bourbon cocktail *I don't remember what it's called it was that good ;)  *Wait I remember...the Old Facist! BFF: A girly drink...with Bourbon and grapefruit. Really pretty..very refreshing.  STARTER: 1/2 dozen P.E.I oysters...super tasty and really big! The horseradish was incredible, grated fresh on the side...had a really big bite to it...stung the nostrels...it was great!  On to the second drink...   ME: A glass of Sangiovese BFF: A glass of Bourbon. Neat. Had some spicey notes to it. Really danced on the tongue. Great flavour.  *We shared everything...best way to do it.*  1st DISH: Bone Marrow. AMAZING! Go try it...best I've had in the city. I'm a food snob...believe me this is incredible. Ask Bret for the luge right after...he'll hook you up. Don't question it...just do it ;)  2nd DISH: Some lamb sausage, chickpea and shrimp dish...very savory. Addictive bread dipping. Order it and you'll know what I'm talking about. *Oh...side note...they give you grilled sourdough bread with the dishes that require it. YUM!*  3rd DISH: THE MEAT PLATTER!!!! Loved it! The foie gras was indescribably buttery and just mouth watering. The smoked, cured meats on the board were tasty. It could do without the curried pickle veggies tho...its' been done before...moving on. But other then the pickled veggies, this board rocked. It's their most ordered piece on the menu sooooo...order it!   I just moved to the east end and never looked back (sorry over rated west end) and so far this place is my favorite in Leslieville. *AFT being my second fav.   OVERALL: Great service! Amazing menu! Addictively delicious bevies! How could you not want to visit this place!   Cheers!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I've been 4-5 times for dinner, and my experience has always been above average. Oysters, happy hour, great wines, and they keep the menu fresh. Most recently, the scallop dish is one of my favourites."}
{"text":"Goods & Provisions is another one of my favorites in Toronto.  Limited menu, but some really good dishes.  Of course, the dish I kept coming back for was the 16oz Rib Eye - had this steak about five times when I was in Toronto, and it was always cooked a perfect medium rare.  Sliced for you, it also comes with a bone marrow butter for that extra hit of fatty deliciousness."}
{"text":"Goods & Provisions is unique, to say the least. Gorgeous interior with dark wood panelled walls, reclaimed doors, taxidermy, antique and eclectic furnishings done right and just the right heaviness to be cozy. Burly lumberjack-shirted-upturned-moustached men buzz about taking orders and slinging vintage cocktails. This bar is very \"bourbon\" but I sampled a  Pimms and lemonade that was delicious. I ordered another and  the second was too light on the booze, too watery and disappointing. the SO had beer and we slit the daily terrine plater with pickled veg.   The menu is sparse, its more for drinks and snacks then full meals. Get here early, as it is always full. Welcome addition to the neighbourhood, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an after work drink and snack. Servers super friendly, decor is cute and quirky.  The fries are amazing."}
{"text":"This is primarily a place for drinks and cocktails.  If you're looking for a memorable food experience, this is not the place to go to.  Having said that, the current menu is not at all like what is posted on the website.  The current slate of dishes are mostly Asian-fusion inspired, and rather lack-luster, that I feel they should have stuck to the current website menu.  And also makes me question why they opted for such a drastic change.  Anyway, if my memory serves me right, my friend and I ordered the following:  ...half-dozen oysters, I believe they were from New Brunswick (the bartender shucking them didn't know what he was doing, and left shell fragments in the oysters)...  ...some sort of cold noodle salad (a take on a Vietnamese salad), which had some avocado, shredded cabbage, and sweet vinaigrette dressing... ...a torched beef tartare, that had an interesting creamy dressing on top, and was \"Asia-fied\" with sesame oil... ...and a scallop and pork belly, with a taro and chive mash (the scallop was too salty, and the pork belly was a puny strip...c'mon, really?  Skimping out on the pork belly?  That stuff is pretty cheap)  These dishes should be considered tapas, because the portions were quite small and extremely pricey for their size.  In fact, the dishes were so small, that my friend and I paid our bill as quickly as possible so we could drive down the street to grab burgers from Burger's Priest, before they closed for the night.  Normally, I would provide photos of the dishes, but the ambient lighting was too low to get any decent shots.  Overall, a great environment for drinks (as their menu appears to be catering more towards beverages), but if you're looking to get a decent meal I would recommend opting for somewhere else."}
{"text":"We love it here. It's our favourite neighbourhood haunt. Great food and exceptional cocktails. The best bourbon sours in the city and consistently excellent oysters. Add to that an amazing alt 80's soundtrack and we keep coming back."}
{"text":"Love.  Flat Iron Steak, frites with duck fat and thyme. Caesar salad a must.  Manhattan done superbly well."}
{"text":"The best cocktails in Leslieville!   Excellent service and really delicious food will keep me and my partner coming back!  On our last trip we loved:  - the oysters - the snack board - the prime rib burger - old fascist cocktail - full bodied take on an old fashioned (this is better!) - old maid - my new favourite gin cocktail!!! - sazerac sour - excellent spin on a whisky sour"}
{"text":"This is a cool spot by my house that has a bunch of really good cocktails.  I recently had a \"dark and stormy\" which is made with ginger beer and it was delicious.  Its one of those dangerous drinks that you drink too quickly and then realize its given you a swift kick in the rear.  The menu is pretty limited but I guess its not meant to be too foody but the things I tried were good.  I do get a bit of a \"too cool\" vibe from the bartenders but overall its a great spot to stop for an unusual drink"}
{"text":"A small, minimal-table, dark, and moody restaurant. Small, sharing plates in the $10-20 range, each best for 2 people or 3 snackers. Our hostess had a boisterous laughter. Drink menu leans toward the bourbon side if that's your thing. Antique decor. Door handles may pop off when you try to turn them to use the washroom.  A nice date spot if you're into dining in the deep dark with candle light sipping bourbon."}
{"text":"The Goods: The drink menu with old fashioned cocktails and bourbon. The Provisions: Food.  A small selection of some very tasty eats!  This is a tiny bar that's a great spot to grab a drink and a bite. The front window opens up and on a nice day, it's prime seating.  We came here on a Wednesday night and there were lots of seats available. The bar is the best place to sit!  Bartenders are friendly and attentive.  For starters we had the bone marrow ($9). I thought the marrow could have been cooked a little longer...  It was still good, I found it was slightly under-seasoned and the large grain sea salt was a bit too crunchy.  Overall, it was still fatty-delicious and perfect for two people to share.  I had to order the Steak Frites ($24) 1) Steak - They didn't ask us how we wanted our steaks served (?).. but the garlic butter melting on top made up for it. 2) Duck fat fries - Skinny fries, not that crunchy, not as ducky as expected 3) Fried oyster - Ok, that was the highlight of my meal. The salty battered oyster of awesomeness.  Hell's yes.  I like how they give you a real steak knife. It's actually made in Brazil.   That thing was serious.  Heavy serrated blade of meat destruction.  Overall, this is a great neighborhood spot, if I'm in the area, I might pop in for some bourbon and oysters!"}
{"text":"Suuuuuch a nice place with attention to detail on every aspect: drinks, food, vibe, deco. However, they no longer do happy hour :("}
{"text":"Good food. Good decor. Awesome attentive staff. Glad I picked this place. Few nice places in the east end. This was a no-brainer."}
{"text":"Music selection was on point, or as hubs put it, \"this music rocks my ass off.\" Stone Roses, etc.  Happy Hour every day from open until 7pm - $5 certain drafts, $8 certain cocktails. Had a sloe gin gin fizz and a dark and stormy. Both were good.  Cute spot for a cocktail. Not vegan friendly for dinner."}
{"text":"Seriously the marriage of Asian and comfort food has joined forevermore. I could eat here every night.   And the old fascist cocktail is going to be replicated by me soon. Probably not with the same yummy results.  Service attentive yet not overwhelming."}
{"text":"We went to Goods & Provisions to celebrate an anniversary with delish Spanish food. The cocktails were killer, the bartender made me a couple of virgin darn and stormies with a delicious candied ginger garnish. My husband loved their negroni.   We ate a little bit of everything. The sardines were excellent and the patatas bravas were the best I've had outside of Spain. The shishito peppers (pimientos de padrón) were also very nice, though there were more hot ones than I would have anticipated in a typical order and they could have used a bit more salt.   The pork belly was excellent, a quail's egg never goes amiss! The octopus was flavourful and perfectly cooked. The brussel sprouts were very nice, smokey and spicy but the smoked trout seemed a bit out of place.   As other reviewers have mentioned it is awfully dark but otherwise nicely decorated, with a good atmosphere. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday ~8pm. Atmosphere pretty good, small restaurant and we had a cozy table at the back. Servers were great and claimed to have invented a cocktail that day which were awesome (also makes you feel hip that you are trying something that was supposedly just invented).  Korean Fried Chicken - unreal. Just the right amount of spice...very very tasty. Fish Board - interesting flavours. Some parts of it were better than others, but overall a unique plate. Gnocchi - Real good. Full of flavour.  I would definitely recommend this spot. Rather reasonable as well, the three items above split between two filled us up and were all between 15-20. Has a pretty diverse menu so something for everyone."}
{"text":"Ribeye steak with bone marrow butter. And a potent cocktail list. Add all that to a tapas-like menu and oysters and you have a recipe for a good time.   The space is compact and gets busy and loud quickly. The downside is cash or debit only."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 went in for dinner as we were headed to Greta Solomon's a couple of doors away but they were closed.  What a nice surprise as we were warmly greeted and quickly shown our table.  4 stars awarded for: Cozy & casual dining atmosphere Cool & original cocktail & drink selection Small tapas plates with delicious food Service is top notch and attentive  1 star removed due to: Too dark (all the patrons had their phones out in order to read the menu)  We did not get out plates at the same time, neither did any of the surrounding diners, as 1 person got their Prime Rib burger (and nearly finished it) I got my dish 3 minutes later and 2 other people were still waiting for Steak Tartar which came 10 minutes after the 1st person got their burger.  The Brussel Sprouts I ordered came when I had already finished eating and I had to pack them up to go.  Overall a great dining experience"}
{"text":"Food was good, but it was way to dark. We sat in the widow seat for a nice dinner. The steak and pasta were great, but we couldn't see the food. The Brussel sprouts were good - spicy and sweet. I'm not exaggerating when I say I have no idea what I was putting on my fork. You can't sell a forty dollar steak in a place where people can't see it. They had small candles on the table, but it wasn't enough for a place that serves actual food (fine if it were just a bar)."}
{"text":"I can't believe its taken me this long to check this place out. We loved it! Felt comfortable from the moment we arrived. Friendly service, great food, cozy atmosphere. I had the Korean chicken sandwich, and the special cod appy. Hubby had the lamb ragu pasta. Everything was terrific, especially the yummy sandwich. I'll be back for that."}
{"text":"Great cocktails (try the hand in glove) and sharing menu! The miso glazed chicken wings, smoked trout rillette and the brussel sprouts were the standouts. I wouldn't bother again with the octopus carpaccio and the steak tartare was fine but not memorable. The frites were also great, I love crispy, thin fries, and these were right up my alley.   I didn't have any issues with the brightness (or lack thereof). We sat at the bar, so maybe that helped. I will say that the bathrooms were unnecessarily dark, lit by a single tea light. My boyfriend said he saw a light switch, but I could not possibly have seen it. A girl also walked in as I was washing my hands - apparently I couldn't see well enough to lock the door properly either."}
{"text":"Albeit that the clientele is predominantly yuppies, this is a cool little local joint owned by the same people  who own the Comrade down the street.  The decor is old school with vintage and antique pieces.  I would describe it as old school pub, the kind akin to the place where Jack + Fabrizzio gamble for their tickets aboard the Titanic in the opening scene.  My favourite piece is the PRESCRIPTION shelf that serves as a liquor cabinet.  The menu features dishes such as Korean fried chicken, which pays hommage to co-owners Nikki Andriet and Dean Fletcher's travels to Asia; offerings such as steak tartare and oxtail point to the chef's love affair with meat.  The drinks here, like sister bar, the Comrade (just down the street) are smooth and refined. The Judy Blue Eyes ($12) made from my favourite Tromba Tequila, Cointreau, lavender, bitters, vanilla syrup, yuzu and orange flower water rivals (if not better) than any of the pretentious downtown restaurants which are not shy to charge you upwards of $18 for a drink.  I guess that's just one of the perks of being East of the city; cocktails here are all under $14.  While I was very tempted to order the bone marrow, Korean fried chicken and oxtail poutine - I opt for their daily Po'Boy ($16), soft shell crab wedged between slices of buttery toast with a side salad.  Although I always imagined having my first Chicken + Waffles ($19) experience down South - my inaugural run-in at Goods & Provisions only has be excited for the real deal.  Juicy pieces of chicken breast are fried in a crispy batter, served with maple syrup and slaw.  Never thought waffles for dinner could be this yummy!  For dessert the chef served up a velvety Chocolate Terrine with almonds and Chantilly cream.  I can't wait to come back to try the rest of the menu.  Cocktail hour is Monday to Saturday from 5:30PM - 7PM featuring half price beer, wine and select cocktails."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The combination of ambiance, food, cocktails and staff makes it so unique and perfect, I can't wait to go back.   The old fascist - I can still taste the layers of flavour in that drink. It's a nice 3oz cocktail that is meant to be sipped and cradled in your taste buds.   I tried the wild boar empanada and the trout salad. I loved the trout salad - it was delicate, fresh and really well balanced.   I think this will be my go to cocktail bar going forward."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try out Goods and Provisions.   We went last week on a Thursday. The place was busy but we managed to get a table right away. Unfortunately, our dinner was marred by a number of things. We had two servers, one (a female) was great . Our male server was basically useless.  I had the steak frites. The fries were cooked perfectly then drowned in seasoning, rosemary I think. Same with the steak, it was an excellent cut of meat but again over seasoned.  When we inquired about the desert options, our server(the useless one),  he couldn't describe what the chocolate desert item was. There was only one chocolate item listed on the menu and it was simply listed as \"chocolate.\" He struggled to articulate what it was, mentioning something about mouse. After waiting longer than our main course for our desert, an over salted flour-less chocolate cake arrived.  As some other posters noted this isn't a cheap restaurant and has been open long enough that the kinks with staffing should be ironed out. Another annoyance, they don't have a web site or post their menu on line.   A disappointing trip, not sure I would return."}
{"text":"The one staff member was very friendly, the other was rude and indifferent. The owner yelled at as, will never be back."}
{"text":"I gotta say, G&P is a very solid 4 stars for me!  I'm shocked that it has so many mediocre reviews.     Have been twice.  Always love the atmosphere and vibe.  It's definitely a small place with a great bar, wood paneling and wonderful mood lighting.  It's a great cozy place for a drink, a definitely throw back to an the   On the food, a couple of highlights from my recent visit: -they have KFC, Korean Fried Chicken!!!!  It's two drumsticks that are double-fried in duck fat (according to the owner) in a delish sweet, sticky and spicy sauce.  It was excellent and reminiscent of KFC I've had in the US (having never been to Korea).  I wish they used wings instead, but I'll take it! -Oysters from New Brunswick were fresh, sweet and fresh - delish! -terrine board: It was duck themed with duck proscuitto, duck terrine, pickled veggies, cheese and a demi-baguette.  Everything was excellent, but felt pricey at $17 -Beef brisket poutine: Wonderful shoestring fries covered with tender beef brisket in a foie gras sauce and cheese curds.  Indulgently marvelous! -Pork platter: Ribs were excellent!  Dry smoked, but super tender.  Baked beans were gooey, smokey and delish!  We didn't love the biscuit, pulled pork and coleslaw.  It was dry and cold...only miss of the evening -Drinks: maplewood, dark and stormy, and a tempernillo.  All excellent! -Dessert: Pecan pie.  Delicious, but wish it wasn't served cold!    Yes, they're chef left in Feb, but the food quality hasn't decreased imo!"}
{"text":"Maybe I was expecting too much from reviews and blogs but I wasn't blown away however I would say it's definitely above average compared to other TO restaurants. Great ambiance and service.   The food was different but as mentioned not blown away, was kinda expecting to be blown away like how I was when I had really good tapas in Barcelona. Anyhow the 2 special appetizers were blood sausage on toast with creme fresh and pulled pork croquette. Both were intriguing but I'm not dieing to try it again.   The main was Korean tacos, which to me basically just tasted like it was described, I was expecting some kinda new combined taste but the ingredients were really fresh. Steak was really tender but maybe too much butter, the duck fat frets just tasted like regular fries?   I'm in the DT core so I probably won't be back out to the east side, instead if I'm in the area I'll probably go to Chino Locos again."}
{"text":"I went here for a drink with my lady and sat at the bar. The bartender was acting like a petulant child and making all sorts of comments about how he hates making a certain drink (not ours) and going off. blah blah blah.... We had to practically fire a flare gun to get his attention so we could pay for our drinks. (it's a tiny place so no reason he couldnt take notice)  He never as much made eye contact or said a word and handed us the bill. No tip for you freindo"}
{"text":"Great cozy spot with delicious, well crafted cocktails, top notch oysters (shucked really well too), friendly staff and tasty share plates. It would be great if there were a few more dinner options that weren't small share plates...but it does the job. Try the tuna tostadas.   Please owners: get yourself a credit card machine. It's 2016 and this is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Atttitude x 10. No credit cards. Non-pints of beer. and a menu hostile to vegetarians. Never again."}
{"text":"Yummy. That sums it up. I had some kind of braised beef and while it was hard to see (they keep it pretty dark in there), it was pretty delicious. Great for a date though it might get a little loud as this little place fills up."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak tartare.  It was delish, but the portion sizes are small.  My friends ordered the gnocchi and the chicken and waffles.  Yes, i said it, chicken and waffles.   It was great to try, I'd probably go back again, but for tapas and beer.   Or when I'm having a skinny day.  ha ha."}
{"text":"G AND P is the perfect example of a place that had a myriad of reviews, totalling an overall decent score and when finally sampled turned out to be stellar.  A good little lesson in what having an open heart and a little risk-taking can get you.  i won't bore you with every dish i had except to say that everything i had was nothing short of FANFUCKINGTASTIC. the best was their SOUTHERN FRIED KOREAN CHICKEN.  our server was so slick and knowledgeable that in addition to answering a question about what the suggested way of eating at this place was - a lot of sharing plates- she said lead us through a rundown of just about every dish and its merits - quickly and thoroughly.    myself and my brother had 12 oysters and 4 other dishes between us and it was the perfect amount.    a lot of work has been put into this place, from the food choices, the presentation, even the cleanliness of the bathrooms - like you are in someone's house  (who did a whole top to bottom cleanup in preparation for your arrival.).  plus they had Stiegl on tap..."}
{"text":"We were having a pretty decent night already, but Goods & Provisions took it to the next level.  As others have mentioned, the music and ambiance were great. Service was crazily friendly for such a cool place. Happy hour deals were a nice surprise - we opted for a half-price bottle of wine which was definitely a good look.   Someone previously mentioned that the serving size of the Bone Marrow was small, but they must've had bad luck, or the restaurant read their review and stepped up their game because ours was a hearty-sized portion, able to quell even my unrelenting thirst for the beefy goodness of internal bone matter.  Oysters were also great, fresh of the boat from P.E.I.  Overall great vibe, great food, great service and great prices. If we lived in Leslieville this would be our go-to spot. Will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!   Cocktails are the way to go here!   I liked the mezcal sour and hand and glove a lot because they were sweet and had a cool foam.  I didn't like the old fascist because of the strong alcoholic taste, but definitely good for ya'll bourbon drinkers. The penicillin was ok, but I prefer the sweeter drinks with foam.  The verdict on food:  Faves:  Taco tostadas - delicious! Fully loaded. The tuna was juicy. The onion flakes and sauce were so good! Everyone should get this! A+  Buttermilk chicken: crispy and had a kick. Not bad. Only three pieces though. B+  Meh:  Bone marrow: there wasn't enough of it. One  of the marrows was so tiny. The marrow seemed to have shrunk in the baking process, but it wasn't too salty which I liked.  B-  Smoked trout and asparagus: nicely presented but the trout felt like it came out of a can. Asparagus was nicely prepared. Soft, but not overlooked. B-  We spent $130 for 4 drinks and 4 dishes (not including tips).  This place has more of a bar feel so i would definitely come for drinks and snacks, but not to have a meal again because it's pricey, not filling, and meals aren't their speciality in my opinion.  Reminded of me of bar ravel with seats and tables.   Servers were very nice and took care of us!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where I suddenly feel 10% more hip the minute I walk in the door. Then I feel 10% more hip then that when I decide that I'm going to spend $18 on one drink and not care.   The atmosphere is great, so are the drinks. In fact, I would say the drinks are near fantastic but you definitely pay for the quality and inventiveness of the awesome cocktails.  There is a food menu, people seem to order food. I go for the cocktails when I'm feeling fancy and want to instantly increase my \"hipness\"."}
{"text":"Edit review since my first impression below.  Loving the atmosphere and staff, I've been back several times now for their bourbon list! Food is a little pricy but I have to say the burger is the best I've ever had! So burger, Brussels sprouts and fries are my go to food items! This is my go to neighborhood bar!   First impression:  Very dark atmosphere, wouldn't say I hated it wouldn't say I loved it either. Cocktails are good and the drink menu is stacked with pretty good quality. However, the food is overpriced for what you get I was a little disappointed in portion size. $16 for two small tuna taco toastadas is just absurd. Burger and Brussels sprouts are good though."}
{"text":"Took my friend there for his birthday. We both like the atmosphere here, laid back, casual yet there's some warmth to it.   I enjoyed Penecillin cocktail. Drinks are decent here. We had   The terrine board was nice. I enjoyed it for the most part. We shared the streak frites and pork plate. My friend did a great job on the fries that came with it. The pulled pork portion was nice. The rib was nothing special, i wish I could send it back. Mains were not memorable at all. What saved the experience was the pecan pie was actually good served ond the cold side! Would i come back? Probably not for dinner. For a quick drink and a snack, I'd hang there again."}
{"text":"Went to G&P for a night out baby-free with the cousins. Right when you walked in you got a whiff of musty grandmas mothball closet/wet rag. One star lost for odor. Our waitress was pleasant and was able to whip up a nice virgin cocktail for Caleigh. We started with oysters (a food I'm still unsure about).. They were ok but the \"fresh shaved\" horseradish was very weak. Next were the shrimp lettuce wraps- nice clean tapas that set the bar pretty high. Salmon croquettes were good but no one was ecstatic. After the fish fry we had the almost vegan salad- fresh and crunchy. Now here's where shit hit the fan... The meat dishes were dirt mcgirt. The short rib was nothing like a briscuit.. Instead it was a sloppy puddle of bones and fat. The baby back pork ribs were certainly not baby backs- small bones covered in fat and musty grandmas undies sauce. Now we're down to 3 stars. Thank god for the gnocchi and Brussels sprouts- both were solid and saved the evening. Since we were still hungry we ordered some tuna tortas and shisshy peppers- both were solid and since we were now a few drinks in everyone was in a positive mood. The bread pudding was out dessert and it was delicious- my only issue was they had some crunchy crap on top instead of ice cream which would have made this a 4 star meal. Overall cool vibe but light some candles Goods, and my advice is stray away from anything with the word rib in it. Xoxo, Weiss"}
{"text":"We are new to the city and, while exploring a new neighbourhood, stumbled upon this charming place. The open front with blues pouring to the sidewalk enticed us in.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great cocktails in an old-time setting. The bourbon list is extensive, up to and including a rare bottle of Pappy Van Winkle 12. The Thai Reviver ($10) was generously seasoned with Peychaud's Bitters and pretty god-damn refreshing. It looks like they've got the makings of a great Sazerac but I'll have to come back to find out. Only 3 draft taps but each with a distinctly different beer (Affligem Blonde, De Konick, & Steigl) and a good selection of craft bottles."}
{"text":"Oh my god their Hand in Glove cocktail is one of the best things I've ever had. Their cheeseburger that they recently added to the menu is probably one of the best I've had in the city. Though they keep changing the menu to give variety, unfortunately they remove some really delicious items that were worth going back for, which is why I'm taking away a star. Recently they removed oysters off their menu which is quite disappointing! Ambiance is nice. Friendly people and amazing music. Sort of on the dark side so I've definitely seen people pull out their phone iPhones so that they can read the menu.   Overall, would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our time here! Some people have commented that it is too dark in the restaurant, however I enjoyed how dark it was because it makes it more intimate. We tried the spicy octopus with crispy potatoes, wild boar empanada, wild mushroom brioche and jamon croqueta. All were tasty and unique but the stand-out was the octopus. We finished with a cheesecake which was on the plain side but nevertheless delicious. We came during cocktail hour so drinks were a good value. The only complaint was service was a bit slow and disjointed. Would return again!"}
{"text":"We had the best night here!! The cocktails were fun and inventive,the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was perfect!   Overall 10/10"}
{"text":"We first discovered Goods and Provisions when we went for after dinner drinks. It had amazing ambience, an extensive bourbon list, and awesome glasses in which they served the bourbon. I noticed the list of dinner specials and made a mental note to come back for dinner.  So this evening we did. I must admit, my expectations were high. We opted for an early dinner as we had skipped lunch, and arranged to meet at 6:00, not thinking to check the hours. We arrived at 5:57..and were surprised to find out the restaurant actually opens its doors at 6. Huh. Suddenly I felt lame for eating early.  Our waiter reminded me of Jason Segal in terms of looks. He was lanky, on the verge of being awkward, but pleasant. My friend wanted a brandy, and discovered they don't have brandy, only cognac. She had to settle for some rye, while I got a bourbon in a suitably heavy and intricately cut glass. Our third dining companion arrived, and our waiter gave us the rundown on the daily specials.  It was so dark in there we had to hold the candle to the menu in order to read it. Other patrons were more resourceful and used their phones to read. The music was very loud considering the hour and the fact that there were about 6 guests. Luckily, there were few choices and we all decided to have steak, and started with some oysters.  The oysters came quickly, and arrived with the basic accompaniments. Not bad, but honestly, it is hard to mess up oysters. Kudos to \"Jason\" for being all over clearing our plates and topping our wine glasses.   Our steaks arrived with almost perfect timing. It was topped with a fried oyster and some sort of herbed butter. Unfortunately, I ordered my steak rare, and got Pittsburgh Blue. So much so that my butter didn't even melt on the steak. I had to cut an enormous fat vein out of it. However, it was seasoned beautifully, and I ate about half of it, as it was probably at least 12 ounces, and I'm not a puma. The deep fried oyster was extraordinarily salty, and I wish I had eaten little pieces of it with my steak, rather than all at once.  The frites that came with it were delicious. When I asked for ketchup, the server brought over \"house ketchup\" which although adorable in a mini ketchup bottle, had this weird smoked flavour and was somewhat watery. We ordered a side of swiss chard to go with our meal, and they served big chunky stringy stems along with the greens, had no seasoning on them, and were kind of gritty. It serves us right for wanting vegetables with our meal.   We were seated in a draft, and I desperately wanted something to warm me up. Apparently they don't have any hot drinks. What the hell kind of restaurant doesn't serve hot drinks?? So I was back to the bourbon, and we shared the chocolate terrine with sea salt and the caramel bread pudding with smoked walnuts, almonds, and caramelized bacon.  The terrine was ok, nothing to write home about, so rich that I could only eat a few forkfuls. The bread pudding itself was delicious, caramel sauce was decadent. The smoked walnuts were weird, and made me think that somebody went a little crazy with the smoker. I immediately regretted putting the caramelized bacon in my mouth. Not everything tastes better with bacon.   Before I wrap up, I must comment on the bathroom. Although it was very nicely decorated, it was so tiny it made it hard to breath. Almost like they renovated the restaurant, and at the end of the renovation someone realized that their guests would probably have to use the bathroom at some point. There was some running around and then they opened the broom closet, ripped out the brooms and said \"Quick, throw a toilet and some wainscoting in here!\"  The price of the food for what we got was outrageous. I highly recommend going here for a drink, but pass the food by. It isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Goods and Provisions has a lovely atmosphere, visually. I enjoyed the fish tacos, but do wish they had meal-sized portions. The big problem for me here is the volume of their music. It's inappropriate for such a small, intimate room. This isn't Pat and Marios. They  play good music, but they don't need to shove it down our throats while we're having dinner at 7pm and shouting across the small table like we're in a club. Not romantic, nor is it attractive to smart, cool people that like having conversations with their friends."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 Stars! We waited to go explore the east side more, I feel that I do not venture out there as much as I should. On New Years Eve, we decided to grab a drink here to avoid the chaos in Nathan Philips. The atmosphere was very smoothing. I enjoyed the decor along with the music-music from the 60's and 70's were playing.    We both grabbed a drink each. I wanted a drink that was sour and sweet at the same time but I did not want a boozy drink. The server recommended me to get the Mezcal Sour. I got the Mezcal Sour and my friend got the penicillin. We both enjoyed our drinks. I wished my drink was more balanced, I felt that it was missing a little something. The servers were attentive but not intrusive. I enjoyed myself there. As a plus, they gave us champagne on New Years, which was a nice touch!    This place has its charm, and you can note the attention to detail in their decor."}
{"text":"This will be brief.  I don't eat pork.  Friend says get the pork platter.  I eat pork.  It's the most amazing pulled pork, rib, pork belly I've ever experienced.  Biscuit and slaw fell flat and our server couldn't make strong drink recs, but otherwise the place is solid."}
{"text":"I used to like this place but unfortunately they made me feel terrible the last time I was here, which was 10 minutes ago. I'm writing this from a neighbouring restaurant.  They have a \"strict no laptop policy,\" which is fine, if only they had let me know before I started settling in with my laptop and ordering.   The cocktail was good. Penicillin. I ordered it last time and it was just as delicious this time. I came here ready to spend some money but 5 minutes into my stay was told about the policy and that I would have to leave as soon as darkness fall. Thanks for the heads up, hence 2 stars instead of 1.  Unfortunately the owners' pretentiousness and lack of desire to evolve has left a taste more sour in my mouth than that of the fresh lemons and limes used in this delicious cocktail.  I will stop recommending Goods and Provisions to my friends. In fact, I walked past one on the way to somewhere else and told him about my terrible experience.  I feel sorry for the server I had. She seemed nice, understanding and more up with the times. I wanted to tip her on more than just a drink but oh well, such is life.  I don't like their attitude and the way they made me feel the last time I was there but if you want to know how I feel about the food, read my previous review.  Thanks, Goods and Provisions, making me feel so rejected, like a second class citizen."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and each time is better than the last! The soup, always great, plowman's lunch entree is always interesting and the bread is great.  Cocktails were served a tad slow, but the atmosphere was cozy, so I didn't mind. Oysters were perfectly chilled. BBQ platter was MASSIVE and had half of it for lunch the next day, Maybe I've just had good luck, but I think there must be some genius in the kitchen. :)"}
{"text":"Lovely, upscale bar with inventive cocktails and a solid kitchen. Service is attentive without being intrusive. The decor and ambience is old-world meets hipsterish, but also warm and inviting. Music is on the loud side; one of those places where you practically have to yell in order to be heard. Normally I might dock a star for that, but the overall quality of everything else deserves its due."}
{"text":"great pub environment with lounge taste. casual and yet candlelit, very charming place to grab wine and oysters or pub grub."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for food and drinks. I ordered the bone marrow, and it was absolutely delicious. The service was great, and I liked that the atmosphere was dark--much like a speakeasy. I would have given this place five stars, but it turns out that they do not accept credit cards. Only cash, and Canadian debit cards--as a foreigner (from the U.S.) this made things complicated, and my friend had to pay for the entire meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! The bone marrow was generous and tasty. The Caesar was delicious with whole mustard. The duck was perfectly cooked with a beautifully smoked Swiss chard. Service was outstanding. Knowledgeable, friendly and well paced. The restaurant itself is cozy and unique. Overall a bloody AMAZING restaurant. GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"So tried this place out last night. It's a bit overrated I'd say...it's Yorkville prices without the Yorkville experience. Very limited menu though the service was excellent. Whatever you do DO NOT get the 'Meat Pie'...it's by far the worst item on the menu. The best is likely the shellfish soup - ask them to add a bit of spice to it if you like. I likely wouldn't go back here."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the \"Cocktail\" Hour that Goods & Provisions offers everyday from 5:30 - 7:00 pm.  Half price on all beers, wines and 3 selected cocktails (you will see the symbol CH next to those!)  Their taps are mainly imports but if I can drink a Delerium Tremens for $4, I am not complaining! There are also some bottles to select from if you prefer more local beer  like a Beau's Lugtread Lager (600 ml)  for $5.50!  I was really tempted to order some snack: duck fat frites and even some oysters..  I guess there will be a next time..."}
{"text":"What a stylish and sumptuous little gastropub. I had a wonderful time at Goods and Provisions. The staff are friendly, welcoming and attentive (nothing that should not be expected). Ambiance is dimmed lighting, eclectic antique decor that is well designed without feeling forced. The cocktail list had the regular tales on the classics, with personalized touches. I really loved the The Old Fascist, which is like an old fashioned with smokey spiciness. I couldn't resist Hand in Glove because of the reference to The Smith's Song--the owner's a big 80's music fan and they played a great mix of tunes I hadn't heard in years (not the overplayed), as well as some older bluesy rock. Finally, the food. My friend and I did not eat a lot. Wish we'd had more, but now there's more reason to return. The tuna on tostada was a ceviche-style tuna dish that was out of this world delicious. Best of the kind I've ever eaten. We also shared pork belly and quail egg on brioche. Scrumptious. Finally we had wild mushrooms on toast--if you're a mushroom fan, don't pass this one by.  It's the little touches that make a great restaurant stand out. When our waiter learned it was a first date, she brought us two coupe glasses of cava. Bravo! Now I'm remembering  I should've tipped higher."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a late dinner on a Tuesday and was certainly impressed with the cocktail and food menu. The drinks were absolutely delicious, you can tell the bartender takes pride in his work. The food was also very delicious, I only wish I could have seen it. We tend to eat with our eye first but unfortunately it was so dark in the restaurant I couldn't see a thing. I completely understand the concept of mood lightly, and I am by no means old enough to have trouble seeing in the dark, but the fact that our waitress was bumping into chairs and tables because she couldn't see means that perhaps they need to turn the lights up just a tad. I was also a bit disappointed in the food portions, I had ordered the beef cheek which was a large portion that I could barely finish on my own, but my dining partner ordering the fried chicken and it was not even close to the amount of what I had. It was more of an appetizer size if anything, rather disappointing. But overall, we did very much enjoy ourselves. I just wish the lights were turned up and the chicken had been a bit more substantial."}
{"text":"A cool-looking place with good atmosphere, but I was, frankly, disappointed with the food. Tuna tostadas start promising in the first bite, but then you realize the flavour burst is all just salt overpowering the tuna. Wild boar empanadas were blah. The best things on the menu were the spicy brussel sprouts - inventive and delicious! The octopus was cooked perfectly (though could have arrived easier to share given this is a tapas joint). And the desserts were good too. Wine list is way overpriced ($50 to $75 as I recall, and given what they are I think this place is really stretching the markups). And the most bizarre thing was no coffee or tea available. Huh? Just weird. Anyway...sorry to be a bummer on what looks like good reviews, but I just don't agree."}
{"text":"While the salad I was able to eat here was delicious I have to give Goods and Provisions 2 stars for their extremely poor hospitality.   My husband and I thought this place looked cute and it reminded us of Brooklyn. We went in for a drink and after my husband had a quick look at the menu we decided to stay to eat. After being seated at a table I scanned the menu for veggie options realizing there were few.   The waiter came over and he told us the specials. Unfortunately anything that sounded remotely vegetarian on the menu had some element cooked in duck fat (summer salad with parsnips cooked in duck fat). Even the fries are cooked in duck fat. The waiter was listing off the specials and mentioned that there were pickled veggies on the terrine plate. I asked for the salad sans parsnips and could i just have an order of pickles? The waiter said I could not order the pickles without the meat because it would throw off the balance in the kitchen - they had only made so many pickles!!!   I asked him to at least ask the chef. (I was sure the chef wouldn't want a guest in his restaurant to go hungry. I've never been to a restaurant that didn't want to feed people). The waiter said yes he could at least ask and walked away smirking. I can only guess that the waiter never did ask because he never came back with an answer and never brought pickles. He ignored me the rest of the time we were there. I understand that I was a vegetarian in a meat focused restaurant but I've never been treated so rudely because I didn't eat meat.  It was a Saturday night. The restaurant was half empty and the waiter knowing that there is nothing I can eat on the menu would rather sell me a plate of arugula and not even try to help me find something else to eat. Its not only poor service but poor business strategy.  My husband's steak was overcooked.  Goods and Provisions should change there name to Duck fat."}
{"text":"In terms of atmosphere, this has to be one of my favorite spots for an intimate drink.  It is dark and grainy, a small space that feels personal and warm without being affected.  Their old fashioned is one of my favorites in the city and their drinks generally are exceptionally well crafted.  They had a great wine menu and it is half-priced bottles on Tuesdays.  Most of all, however, I love their music.  It fits the venue perfectly.  The fact that I noticed the music at all is rare but it is done so exceptionally well here.   I want their playlist.  It if was on songza, I'd play it anytime I was having drinks with someone.  The food I was less excited about.  I had the duck which was good but not fantastic. I had some other things as well but they don't really stand out.  That said, I overlook all of that for what I love about the place."}
