{"text":"They have a a full bar and great drinks, tried the Mojito tasted fresh and the alcohol content was on point. I had the lemon mint hookah with an ice tip. Best experience, chill environment and good music, couldn't have spent my night any other way!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best hookah in Phoenix!  Love this place!!  Not surprising it has such a high rating: the staff, service, and selection are fantastic.  Make sure to try the \"gummy bear\" hookah- it's lip-smackingly delicious!!  They serve great snack food too, til pretty late in the evening.  Highly, highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Excellent hookah bar. I have been to several hookah bars around the valley and this is one of the best. The hookahs are very smooth and are especially good because they use natural coals. The service is excellent. They also serve food and alcohol so it is pretty much a one stop shop. Try the chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for a business conference & decided to drop by this place Friday night close to my resort. Walked in & was greeted by employee right away! Sat me down, walked me through the menu with hookah, drink, & food options. Hookah was fantastic! The owner himself shook my hand & introduced himself. The customer service & the friendly staff itself will make me want to come back here next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This hookah lounge was surprisingly impressive for a number of reasons:  -atmosphere and decor is CLEAN. Places I've been to are generally shoddy and filled with high schoolers that just turned 18/college noobs. Super comfy couches, loud music (they played Destiny's Child!!!), and a projector plus TVs (I enjoyed that they had sports center running).  -the servers were on point. Really chill, but changing out coals before us ever having to ask.   -late night food. You can also order off the food menu from the spot next door, Taziki. I ate pita chips and babaganoush all evening, along with a ton of other goodies that I can't remember the name of-- it's actually an Egyptian food place.  Here's what I would call downsides, but really hard-to-controllables: -it's a little tricky to find. Siri got me there but it's a bit hidden if you're coming from Elliot. -it's BYOB until 10 only. However, I chatted up the owner and there are plans in the future to add a bar, it's hard to get a liquor license in AZ.  I'll definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Authentic egyptian hookah experience.. comfortable couches and atmosphere... Best hookah lounge in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Nice chill place. Staff is friendly. The only problem I have with this is place is, that I believe there is an extra $ services charge on top of the bill and the employees failed to mentioned to me both times that I visited, specially since I gave then a good tip both times (about 23%) of total bill including service charge. That just seems greedy."}
{"text":"The gyro is amazing! The staff is always friendly and down to earth! I was able to check out the hookah side which I was impressed with due to the cleanliness and full bar. I will definitely be coming back to check out the hookah for a chill evening."}
{"text":"They have specials everyday so I chose to go on a Tuesday to catch the well drink 2 for 1 deal and the $3 for 3 tacos deal. The hookah was good but could have been better. The tacos were surprisingly tasty. The music was a variety of good and bad. The staff was very attentive and kept conversion with me. I believe I was charged incorrectly though, even after I told the girl what the deals were but I was in a hurry because my Lyft was outside waiting so I didnt have enough time for her to change it AGAIN."}
{"text":"I was looking for a hookah lounge that also served alcohol and google gave me this place. The thing that ruined the night was terrible service. The staff rarely checked on us and the hookah got harsh and burned out throats due to all the ash from the coals not being changed out. We won't be returning.."}
{"text":"The server was nice, friendly and made us some good drinks! Food was also great!"}
{"text":"Great hookah lounge. It's actually a lounge where you can hear each other talk. The owner of this lounge also owns the restaurant next door (amazing gyros, NOT pre-frozen) and they bring the food to you here. The owner is very friendly as well. Wish it was closer to where I live but the drive might be worth it!"}
{"text":"The people here are so friendly, food is great, I will definitely come back here if I am in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Friendly service. The hookahs are clean and smooth. Ambience is relaxing. Will go here again. Good customer service"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, but doesn't serve beer. We weren't hungry, just interested in trying hookah and a few drinks to relax after a long day. The employee would not even let us stay while the storm passed over. I give him a 1/10 for friendliness as well.  Visited at 550pm on a Tuesday evening, the 12th of August 2014."}
{"text":"Great service.... Very attentive!!! Nice chill pace and good hookah. The staff makes sure you are comfortable and that the hookah never gets to harsh. The DJ was great!!!! Nothing but positive vibes and things to say about this place. Didn't try the food but next time I will... There will be a next time."}
{"text":"Great service and food :) we need an arbic music too ;)  I hope they will serve the great food till they close  it will be nice :)"}
{"text":"I haven't been to too many hookah lounges in my day, but this is one of the better ones Ive been to.  The staff was very nice and attentive and the place had great ventilation so there wasnt smoke all over the place.  Only thing I would have liked differently is the music selection.  Personally, I like more a chill selection when I smoke hookah and the music that was playing was a little too \"clubish\" for my taste.  Maybe that was due to the fact it was a Friday night, not sure.  Overall, good experince and would go there agin"}
{"text":"Really great hookah spot. The flavors are very nice and the service is great. They also serve good food and if you're looking for something more filling there is a good restaurant next door. They are usually playing great music as well."}
{"text":"Nice place, service is very good and food is pretty good too. They are very welcoming and make sure you're comfortable and having a good time."}
{"text":"Terrible hookah terrible service. Ugly place. I will not recommend unless you want a disappointment. Very low class. Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"The only downside to this place is that they don't serve alcohol.   Everything else was perfect. Huge hookahs, attentive (but not overbearing) staff, large selection, good prices. Hell, they even have Turkish Coffee. We got some free pistachio baklava samples too, holy moly were they good.   This is a much needed hangout in the Tempe area, especially for people like me that hate Mill Ave."}
{"text":"The best hookah that I've had in a while.  Tempe has been letting me down a lot with hookah over the years but Nara is awesome.  Attentive staff who definitely make sure that you're comfortable.  The music was great... a little loud at times but I can't really complain.  My new hookah spot. :)"}
{"text":"New place with the best hookah , customer service is beyond great."}
{"text":"This place is perfect. Great music, amazing food, the staff is so friendly and always check up on the hookah!! Love it! I been to a lot of places and the hookah is harsh, service sucks and the environment is just ratchet. This place is classy, chill and high quality for a great price"}
{"text":"Best hookah lounge in the valley! Great music, staff, service and management! Pay a little extra and bring your own alcohol. Doesn't get much better than that. The restaurant next door (same owners) also serves some of the best gyro in town!"}
{"text":"Chill hookah spot. Meno is amazing!!! He takes customer service to another level. We had a great experience tonight!   **correction: I guess it depends on who is working. I went in again tonight with more friends because I recommended this place and the server completely ignores 2 different groups of people. We sat there for 15 minutes and no one spoke to us at all. Didn't even acknowledge us at all. Never again. The woman behind the bar was so disrespectful. We took our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Your secrets are safe at Nara!  Comfy atmosphere. Try the mint guava! Intimate setting with the ones you want to spend quality time with.  I don't think you'll forget the memories you leave behind! :)  BIG Thanks to the owner and staff who helped make it the BEST hookah experience yet! Lots of Laughs and a perfect girls night out!"}
{"text":"Bar tender was amazing and helpful with the hookah and recommending food. Kitchen server not that awesome, rude and practically just threw the plates on the table. Switch her and it's an amazing place to low key hang out!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We came late and starving. Owner went out of his way to reopen kitchen for us.. what service!! I recommend everyone try this place especially new hookah clients."}
{"text":"Decent selection of shisha. Typical atmosphere, but run down burnt furniture cushions. Weird since they charge a $75 damage fee to furniture or hookahs. There is a unnecessary service charge added on top of the hookah charge as well. If you like a lot of smoke out of your hookah, this is not the place for you. Very smooth/weak hookah. Coals need swapped out every 15 minutes or so to keep decent clouds."}
{"text":"Love this place. Come often because the service amazing. Even when they're busy or understaffed they try to take care of everyone. The happy hour of awesome and 5 dollar byob until 10. Always a good experience!"}
{"text":"Pretty bummed, arrived here around 12:45am with some friends to enjoy some hookah and they were closed. Everywhere online it says they're open until 2am. They should probably consider updating the hours of operation. I drove over 45 minutes to come here just to find out they were closed."}
{"text":"It was the typical hookah lounge ambiance,  the flavors didn't seem to be very prominent.  They kept pushing us to have a hookah for every 2 people.  We had a pretty big group but half of them didn't smoke.  The staff was attentive with changing up the coals but when it came to paying the bill it took over 30 mins because the manager had to close us out.  They had a DJ and he played pretty good music if EDM is your taste.  We got some sort of loaded fries, really good as well."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 4 years. I found it on yelp and so happy I did. The service is great and the hookahs are the best. Never had a bad one. Love the check in offer to.   I always bring friends here or just come for a fun relaxing night out. The crowds that come are young professionals. So you feel safe and happy. I can leave my purse on the couch and come back with no worries.   Hookah to harsh ? Or don't like the favor ? No biggie tell them and they will fix it with a smile. I recommend coming here for a good time , good prices and service."}
{"text":"i don't really understand how this place has such high reviews. really not exceptional and i probably wouldn't come back here. i have to say, it was some of the worst hookah i've had. tasted burnt from the start, and produced like no smoke. I also noticed that all of the furniture was dirty looking and had holes burnt in it, so the place doesn't even look nice. I think they could improve the quality of this place simply by cleaning it every now and then because this place was DIRTY. the stars really come from the lady who served us. she was nice and very attentive. but if you're looking for quality hookah and a nice environment... this might not be the best bet."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Staff extremely friendly and hookah are delicious. Atmosphere is perfect for good times. Really enjoyed my time here and im definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome place, has great food and great hooka! If you like to be at a place to sit back and relax, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Really great experience here! Came here on St. Patrick's Day and it wasn't crowded at all when we got there, so we were able to get a table right away. Everything about this place was pretty great, especially the hookah itself. One thing that I will say is that it could be pretty pricy. We selected a hookah that was $16.99 and ordered two drinks (one each) and our bill came out to be just over $50. Unless our drinks were over $15 each, then I'd say that this place charges for coal replacements that we weren't told about. Not terrible between two people, but I really wish I knew how our bill came out to be that high."}
{"text":"I'm not a big hookah kinda guy but this location rocks. They are so friendly and social. I had a great experience the last time I went with friends. Check in and you get a discount on your visit. I believe when I went it was $5 off when you spend at least $20. I think it was worth the experience and plan to visit again soon. Not sure if every night is the same but they play great music and sports are on. They also serve food and drinks. Grab some friends and check out this place- you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm a a frequent hookah smoker , I have a regular hookah lounge that I attend and help out at , but that's not the point right now.            I have been to many hookah lounges around the Metro -Phoenix area and decided to try this one out. I walked in and was greeted immediately with a smile and was seated appropriately.  The ambiance is great for groups , the place is small but quant. The staff is very friendly and always checking up on you constantly.  NOTES: - ice tips available $5.00 - 1 hose hookah 14.99  - 2 hose , $18.99 - Most flavors $14.99 EXCEPT: - Fumari = 16.99, House = $15.99  This is definitely worth coming to and the serve food as well . Highly recommended ."}
{"text":"Love all the hookah flavors, my to go spot any day. Great music playing all the time, the food menu is a must try. Its mouth watering food, the combination of a great flavored smoke, with fresh tasty food combined with a drink?! Cant be more perfect"}
{"text":"Worst Customer Service from who seemed like the manager/Owner. Hookah Sucked...Couldn't blow any clouds...and It just wasnt ours. Everyone was having issues...Wasn't a well ran business. Fight broke out and there was to much bad vibes. The place was extremely small."}
{"text":"Best hookah bar in Tempe a must try for true hookah fans. Management is incredibly friendly and the coals are proper :) can't wait to come here again."}
{"text":"First time here and so far it's really great!  Kadashia was our waiter and she's so genuine and nice.  The hookah hits well, we got the watermelon mint and it taste AMAZING.  And the food is bomb. We got the loaded french fries and the jalapeño popper things.  Really recommend this place (:  P.s a guy that works here is cute. So that helped."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I was out of town for a family reunion and needed to blow off some steam at night.  Found this place through yelp and was pleasantly surprised.  The hookahs are great and the white gummy bear shisha is amazing!  I also got introduced to ice tips for the first time, these things make a huge difference in the smoothness of the hit.  The staff was really attentive and added fresh coals like 5 times and the owner Meeno (sp?) was super chill and gave us some good tips on a restaurant to check out in town.  The atmosphere was chill and comfortable.  Definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
