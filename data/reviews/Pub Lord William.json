{"text":"You'll have to order food if you wanna drink in this newly opened Griffintown pub. A standard pub which the area needed with the burgeoning population of condos. The lamburger was good. The terrace is not even open till 1am."}
{"text":"This pub is the closest thing to an English pub that I've found so far. Inside is all dark wood with a traditional bar. There are high tables and bar stools. I loved the fact that finally I found people standing up and drinking at the bar (very English).   I had the local lager. Very good. I also had the chicken quesadillas which was very tasty and better than average pub food. I will definitely come back to eat here again. Maybe for brunch...  Finally, the staff were attentive and very friendly and music was awesome. Think Killers, Coldplay, Red Hot Chilli Peppers. Awesome."}
{"text":"You know something's right when the owner of a COMPETING club is drinking there :D  Atmosphere: Pub Lord William (henceforth known as PLW) is a new pub by the principals that brought the Ye Old Orchard pubs to Montreal.  Having just recently opened - 2 months of so come end of July 2015  - the place has an industrial shop floor / pub feel to it.  Not to say that its bad - not at all - it's just that it's so spacious! Clean, proper, well set up - this place is here to do business and keep the ever growing young professionals population of Griffen town well fed and liquored up  Service: Top marks here for sure - the owners definitely know what they're doing and how to run a place like this.  The staff is culled from their other locations or recruited based on experienced - you won't get bad service here or have someone lose or mishandle your order.  Waitresses are very very professional and very friendly - making conversation / recommendations and just being all around good to the bone.  Food:  Err, you're here to drink!  Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you look at it) due to a quirk in the liquor licence PLW has, you must order food with your drinks.  Don't look for anything super special - pub food after all - but it's done well and it's cheep.  Hot-dogs & Fries for a few dollars, nachos etc. It's good stuff to snack on but oh so bad for that South Beach Diet... :)  PLS is not exactly located on a well trodden path - but if you're a local or just happen to be in the area you should definitely make this a destination ."}
{"text":"Where do I begin.  Should I talk about the food, service, staff or atmosphere? I will admit that this is a new place and I will gladly give it a second and maybe a third to see if they can iron out the kinks but as it is it only deserves 2 stars If you come for food and only care about nothing else while you're here then you are coming to the right place. Food is very good, well above average pub food and you will be pleasently surprised in the flare that they have added to the usual select.ion. However, if you are at all protective of your sanity or your ears then don't bother stepping through the door. Most of the floor staff seem to get overwhelmed with more than a few tables and orders can take a very long time materialising. They seem to try hard but just can't seem to find their groove. The music is atrocious. The DJ, whose music is WAY too loud for the current setup, in my opinion is not even worthy of working a high school dance. Seems to play very random selection with no flow and no consideration to what the audience seems to enjoy. And did I mention way too loud. Once this place decides whether it is a pub or a club it will be able to hopefully figure out how best to improve."}
{"text":"Great Pub restaurant. Friendly staff, great food choices and great selection of beer. My wife and I will certainly be back regularly."}
{"text":"Classic pub style place with a twist. They have some interesting Montreal inspired drinks that are STRONG and the overall vibe is pretty cozy. It feels like a nice comfy neighbourhood bar. The only thing that they don't tell you until you order is that they don't have a full liquor license yet so you will have to order some food. They do have this $1 charcuterie dish that you can get but it doesn't taste particularly great. Better off ordering food."}
{"text":"Amazing Neighbourhood pub with great food and friendly staff. What else can you ask for?! We come here often and we also order food from here a lot to eat at home. Just be careful if you order wings to go, the sauce is so hot that it melts the plastic container that the sauce comes in."}
{"text":"Vraiment un beau spot pour prendre un verre ! J'aime le look brasserie irlandaise classique ! Le grand bar et vraiment bien aussi et les cocktails sont sur la coche !"}
{"text":"Great fish tacos, nachos and drinks"}
{"text":"Best Mac n cheese in the city. Also great environment!! Definitely will be returning to this place!!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are great. I like the Foosball table tucked away in the back. The pub design is really cool, lots of dark woods. I only wish the outdoor terasse was dog friendly. Typically we don't go to terasses in the summer if the restaurant doesn't accept dogs because it's not fun for Jack to stay home alone on a nice summer evening.  They also do a pretty good brunch on Sundays. Very greasy, good for after a hangover."}
{"text":"Very nice neighbourhood pub. Simple menu but thats what you'd expect. The fish and chips and nachos never disappoint. The service is just excellent, and they have a good selection of beers on tap. The waiting staff always welcomes us warmly and sometimes offers us treats on the house even though we dont go that often (I've only been there 3 times). I also went there for mac and cheese week, which was absolutely excellent. They did not cheap out on the cheese selection for their dish and it was absolutely delicious.   I definitely recommend for a relaxed night, will obviously go back."}
{"text":"I want to give it 4*, but they messed up a burger, super well done and dry. I can't say I'd go out of my way to eat there. The rest was just fine, no complaints."}
{"text":"Super endroit pour y déguster des cocktails fancy! Nous n'avons pas mangé, donc je ne peux pas juger la bouffe, mais les drinks étaient vraiment bons! De plus, l'endroit est super beau et le staff est incroyable!   Je vous le conseille !"}
{"text":"Simply I love it when I get nice service with pleasant and friendly smile. didn't try the food but the drinks were ok and the terrace was so cozy. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Pretty cool new pub with a beautiful patio.  Decent choice of drinks and bloody caesars that are not bad at all, I went for the Big Willy that comes with a candied bacon. The bacon was so good that I had to order a second caesar.   The food menu has some good things to offer. Poutine is just OK, although one of my friends was really happy with the french fries and the gravy was nice, the cheese curds really melted and I strongly believe they should be crunchy. My seasonal salad was beatiful, made with red, yellow and brown tomatoes, which were so tasty as they have been just picked from the garden. You gotta try the home made chips, the perfect snack for your bloody caesar!  The pub inside is spacious, kind of industrial set up, but it feels comfy. We had a blast in the bathrooms, they all have black board walls and little bucket full of chalk pieces. The walls invite you to write something and we, the well grown kids, wrote for the first time in our life on the walls of a bathroom. Now I have to come back to take a picture of the bloody caesar, as I forgot to do it yesterday and may be make another statement on the walls......."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, Super cozy. I've been here a few times and have only tried a few items on their menu, (mac and cheese, fish tacos, and homemade nachos) All three were great! They might have the best pub nachos in the city.  They've got a great beer selections and a couple tv's (4 or 5) they have a downstairs room, that is great for groups for christmas parties, birthdays or whatever really.  The bathrooms have a chalk board design, with chalk in cute little holders. Definitely worth a stop in you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Pub classique avec ses bières & sa bouffe. Intérieur sympa. Prix & service ok. Pinte en fût 7.80$ (bière importée) Bacon cheeseburger 15$. Belle ambiance le vendredi soir, rempli à craquer. Si vous êtes dans le coin de Griffintown et que vous voulez boire/manger dans un pub sympa, ça pourrait être un bon choix. Ouvert depuis juin 2015. Wifi gratuit. Terrasse extérieure en été.   4/5 visité en mars 2016"}
{"text":"Very nice casual resto. Been here for brunch and early dinner and there are enjoyable items on both menus. Prefer afternoon/evening menu. Highlights are: nachos (both options), lamb burger, crab benedict, and Bloody Caesar. Avoid: their version of a cheese steak.  The staff I've interacted w/ are super nice. Place has a cool vibe. Have not been during peak hours though.  Remark: Not a bar! You must order food."}
{"text":"great ambiance, and probably one of the best burgers I've ever had . waitresses are very friendly . cozy spot. love the ironworker picture in your bathroom ! we will def be back"}
{"text":"The staff and management/ownership are very nice. I felt well received and appreciated as a customer.   The location is great and minutes from where I live (less than two if I hustle). Easy to walk to and the 57 bus stop is right outside. Good spot in the summer with the enclosed terrace in the back and proximity to the canal.  The menu is challenging and needs to be fixed asap or this wonderful place won't last long. If it lasts more than 2 yrs, the main reasons will be location and staff. Beer selection passes but needs work. Don't be fooled by the big brewery micro brew fakes.  Owners, work with your chef to find a better-suited menu for this mixed upscale/lowscale location. There's a lot of money in this place but people also want easily accessible food along with their easily accessible living space. You're trying too hard. You don't need to be this unique, you do need to have excellent tasting and well prepared food. Drop the funky mixes and don't overcook (or undercook) your food. It's OK to be a little more mainstream in this location if your goal is profit and happy customers.   Chef, talk to your guests (and locals) and solicit some real no-bullshit feedback to understand what people really want. I'm not convinced that you understand your real market and that you did enough research before coming up with your menu.  I've visited 4 times now since opening week and I will not be back for another try until this summer. I'm willing to keep testing  until you get it right but will not be a regular customer (1-3 times a week) until I see some change. You need to get it right soon or someone else will.  This place has tons of potential but needs some work. 2 stars now could easily be 4 or 5 with a little effort.   ------- Update -------  Great turnaround, guys! I've been back many times since my first post and consider myself a regular now.  The menu has gone through many tweaks and is stable. Food is consistently prepared and tastes great (try the bacon cheeseburger, Mac and cheese, or poutine for a surprise treat). Some new beers were brought in a while ago. New tables and chairs in the front section. Staff is still awesome!  I highly recommend this place, particularly if you're a local looking for a new favourite place where you feel at home."}
{"text":"Old building and nice feeling from the past, nachos very crunchy mmm right place to meet with some friends."}
