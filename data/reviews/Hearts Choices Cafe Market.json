{"text":"We have enjoyed the frozen vegan meats and have been regular customers for those products which seem to be of great quality.  Went in for dinner tonight and ordered the ginger chicken with cashew nuts.  The menu said it came with a \"light sweet sauce\".  It really means so hot it will light your mouth on fire.  We mentioned it to the counter attendant who advised this dish wasn't supposed to be that spicy, but heat of the dish changed depending on who cooks it.  Beware - this is a very spicy Thai dish.  I was able to eat around 1/2 and my companion wasn't able to eat it at all - and she regularly eats spicy East Indian food.  My tongue and throat are still sore from the heat of the dish 1/2 an hour later."}

{"text":"This place is excellent! Love their brunch. It's such a nice place to meet friends for a great relaxing meal. Haven't had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"The latest from Hearts Choices and they are now in the North.  You may know them from thier frozen vegan meats in the farmers market of maybe you've seen the food truck or been to the other resturant in the south?  

 This is a business driven by the customer demands and run by some of the sweetest people ever.  And the food?  So very delicious!  I may be a vegetarian but my husband asks to come here because much of the food is just a  healthier version of a meat dish and he doesn't care it is not actually meat because it tastes good. 

Try the cauliflower wings, the cheesecake and pick up some of the frozen foods you love from the farmers market. 

Id definately recommend for any vegetarians, vegans or open minded omnivores."}
{"text":"I was initially intrigued by Heart Choices' menu online as it surprisingly looked quite delicious for my omnivore taste buds. Everything on the menu looked like it entailed care and diligence to make it stand out from your \"regular boring salad\". The menu had helped me decide to try vegan food for the first time this past weekend.

Located in an unassuming strip, Hearts Choices Café Market can ironically be found neighbouring Master Meats. It is a small quaint café that looks clean and simple. Hearts Choices has numerous vegan dishes available: thai dishes, sandwiches, burgers, jackfruit poutine, vegan bowls, and the list continues! I decided to order the \"cheeze\" burger with a side of \"cheeze\" fries to-go (handmade vegan \"meaty\" patty, sesame bun, special burger sauce, crispy onion strings, cheeze slice, lettuce, tomato, onion pickles). While waiting for my food to be freshly made, I busied myself by looking at the pre-packaged food they had available for purchase (E.g. vegan bacon, chick'un nuggets, corn dogs, salty chicken... etc). They had two full refrigerators of vegan meat, soups, salad dressing, and many more.

Once my order was ready, I excitedly ran home so that I could try my lunch while it was still hot. Everything in the burger was super fresh and delicious. I could definitely tell that the patty was not meat, but its flavourful and saucy attributes made up for the lack of meat. The cheeze slice and \"cheeze fries\" were so legit that I couldn't tell that it was vegan. I would say that my first vegan experience was successful. I confirmed that I am unfortunately more so a meat patty fan for my burgers, but I could definitely go back for the \"cheeze fries\" as an attempt to rid myself of some guilt. I would definitely return to try some of the other items on their menu."}
