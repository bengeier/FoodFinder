{"text":"Best bar in town, now. Friday night has a great crowd. Thursday nights are the best bc Nate is a great bartender. The weekend days are slower, have a different atmosphere, and seems to be more full of local regulars."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie. We felt awkward as F here at first. We actually almost left full drinks and walked out. We decided to stick it out and at least finish one round here.   We ended up agreeing that people weren't unfriendly, they were just shocked to see new faces I guess. When we walked in the door everyone literally stopped what they were doing and stared at us.   We took our drinks to the patio since it was a nice day. The patio is surprisingly nice. I'm sure if can get rowdy late at night here but early in the day/night it was a nice crowd.   The regulars opened up and we almost considered sticking around for a few more. Next time."}
{"text":"This joint is one of only a few late night bars in Mt. Horeb and most of the younger folks, 20's and early 30's, can be found here after the other bars close.  Cheap beer and mixed drinks keeps the people on a tight budget happy.  They have a few pool tables and a huge back deck/patio area thats heated in the winter time so - smokers rejoice!  They have Karaoke and a DJ on the weekends which can be very entertaining.    If a bar fight is going to break out in Mount Horeb, its going to happen here 99% of the time.  But Ive never had an issue at this place and people have always been nice.  In the winter time, you will find that the snowmobilers frequent this joint.  I'm a little older so I don't go here very often but once in a while I'll stop in to grab a cheap beer and survey the scene.  If cheap drinks are your thing, I'd definitely recommend this place.    They do serve food but all they have is a flat top and a fryer so dont expect much other than some greasy bar food.  Thats to be expected and a joint like this so no surprise there.  However, they do have a pizza oven and Tombstone pizzas.  So if its late night and you need to soak up some of that booze in your stomach, the Tombstone pizza is spot on."}
