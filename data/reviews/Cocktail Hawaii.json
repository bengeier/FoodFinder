{"text":"I used to visit here frequently, back when I lived in montreal. Back for a visit, and enjoying a fruit packed plate \"nuit de liban\". I am a big fan of their fruit & achta dishes. I would not recommend eggs/bacon/etc here."}
{"text":"This cute Hawaiian themed restaurant has great breakfast options for reasonable prices. I got the Playa Fiesta, which included a vegetarian omelette, breakfast potatoes, toast, a small salad, and coffee. The food was delicious, the price was right (under $10), and the service was great as well!"}
{"text":"This place is very bright, clean and the food is fresh and excellent. I had the Rosa and I fell in love. It was so good it made my toes curl. Everyone must go there!"}
{"text":"Super quality and original fruit drinks. They take care to give you everything you need when you order takeout- management is obviously very focused on quality and service! Rare for Montreal."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on Nov 17, 2015.  Ordered the Costa Rica breakfast.  Excellent !!! Good food, friendly service, clean and quiet restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh fruit and breakfast quality. Somewhat pricy but large portions could easily be split by two."}
{"text":"In the neighbourhood? Here's the essentials on what you'll see - broken down into 3 :)  Atmosphere: Ah - Welcome to Agraba ... errr, Little Arabia (?) - whatever it's called, this little part of the Shaughnessy Village is the where many folks for the Middle East have set up shop (& homes) - and that's a good thing :) Having traveled for well over 90% of my life to may parts of the world - I appreciate the hospitality of people from the ME.  Cocktail Hawaii is one such place and seeks to re-create the desert houses found in many parts of the Levants (Lebanon, Syria, Palestine etc.) - Arabs love their sweets and are great at making them!  All this to say - the people behind the counter are quite welcoming and happy to be of service.   Food: Creps, Waffales, Ice-cream, smoothies you name it - they have it galore.  I've been to the place at least 2 or more dozen times in the 15 years (pre-Yelp) I've been in Montreal and never have I had a bad meal.  Spoiled for choice and it's made to order so nothing is ever pulled out of the freezer except the ice cream :D - top top marks for this.  Service: Friendly, but minimal - there's really no need to more - they leave you be and that's the way it should be :)  If you've got a hankering for good waffles (as i sometimes do) go here if in the area - honestly, it a better meal than the other places around like Cacao 70, and Juliet et Chocolate which opened near this place recently doesn't have their choice of smoothies and ice creams  Go now - work off the calories later!!!

{"text":"Good portions. Tons of tropical fruit. Crepes!  ...But just average results.  Giant, confusing menu; the staff is helpful but there's only so much you can do with such an onslaught of choices. The bacon was basically popcorn and the eggs were forgetable. My suggestion? Skip breakfast, go straight to the yummy crepes, and add one of those blended tropical drinks. That's a recipe for a four star review right there."}
{"text":"Great breakfast here! Had veggie omelette and the Mambo (fruit, eggs etc)  Fresh, tasty eats and fast, pleasant service! Great price and the fresh OJ was so good.  Recommend this breakfast place in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Si vous êtes à la recherche d'une bonne place pour manger des crêpes. C'est la place au centre-ville de Montréal. Les crêpes sont fait à la perfection et il y a tellement de choix. Vous avez le choix entre les crêpes repas pu dessert. Si vous ne vous ne voulez pas une crepe vous pouvez prendre un cocktail de fruits qui sont aussi tres bon."}
{"text":"Service was friendly. However, the decor looks very old. I ordered the 'Mambo' breakfast which consisted of mostly fruit, undercooked eggs with no seasoning, two strips of bacon, some fried potato slices, and two pieces of sliced white loaf bread. All this cost me over $9. On top of that, I had to pay cash.  No wonder it's always empty. I don't recommend this place. So many better ones around there. Should have tried Java U"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome! It's colorful and lively and when you walk in you feel like you're in Hawaii! The crepes are delicious and the smoothies are just as good! They even have all kinds of interesting flavored coffee!"}
{"text":"Perfect plate for breakfast or brunch. The staff was so nice and very helpful. They said i could switch things that i dont like for other things. I customized my plate and also my juice.  The fruits are fresh and everything was very good. I'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I feel like this is a very cool drunk food spot for crepes. Offering savory and sweet options, and open until the wee hours of the morning, this place satisfied a sweet tooth at midnight. No, I wasn't drunk, but I wanted a low key yummy nosh. A crepe with Nutella and a cup of tea later, I was one happy customer!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast spot got the Sacramento which was a waffle with strawberry, banana and Nutella on top. If your in the area definitely try it out."}
{"text":"absolutely filling and delicious, I don't need to eat for the whole day after one avocado milkshake! it's a bit expensive ($7 for smoothie) but worth it+delicious! the server guy is nice and is open quite late past 2 am very nice late night hangout spot with loud Arabic music playing in the background on most occasions"}
{"text":"we were advised to check this place for the best deals on breakfast by our local friend and we just fell in love with this cafe!  the food is yummy! the portions are huge! the prices are great! the satff is very friendly! and it's open starting 7am!   the ambiance is hawaii-cozy with pink umbrellas at the outdoor patio and the food is with a hint of tropical in it.  try crepes with nutella and bananas with strawberries or crepes with cheese and mashrooms! all under $8!  would definitely go there again and bring a friend along!"}
{"text":"Very good French crepes.  I had the chocolate covered strawberries and banana.  Sweet deliciousness!"}
{"text":"A great little breakfast spot...and you eat before paying. Novel?  Friendly and good portions. Lots of healthy options to add fruit to your breakfast"}
{"text":"Tasty crepes and big portions. Not what I was expecting, got a laugh out of the cheesy \"Hawaiian\" decor.  Not bad for a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"Maybe it's the American in me, this is the freshest, healthiest breakfast I've ever had. It's simple and quick, but I'm in such awe of real fruit and eggs. The coffee is brilliant.  It's a place where you get your own food from the counter but they offer full breakfast plates, crepes, smoothies, fresh juices. I will be back my next trip to MTL."}
{"text":"Les gaufres et les crêpes sont tout simplement incroyable et le service est impeccable sans parler de sens super jus d'orange fraîchement pressé cet endroit est vraiment un incontournable!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast restaurant in the middle of downtown. Not only are the pancake dishes delicious, but they have traditional breakfast options available. The cocktail shakes are also healthy and savory - highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I usually go to allo mon coco for breakfast but this time we went so late and it was a huge lineup. I decided to take my son to cocktail Hawaii and try their crepes and pancakes. It was indeed a very good decision and choice. Everything is fresh, it is a self serving, staff is friendly and food is very good. My son loved their pancake 'Alma' and I took their cocorico crêpes with mushroom crème ans turkey. I really appreciated the food and the effort behind it. It is real food. Go there I recommend it blindly for breakfast or for crepes lovers."}
{"text":"Really cool decor and excellent crepes! I always get the Rosa- which is like strawberries and cream in crepe form and it is *one hundred emoji*. This is a super cute and tasty date spot, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best place in Montreal for breakfast! I would come here for lunch too but only managed to enjoy breakfast on 2 occasions. The service is courteous, friendly and easily accepts substitutions to the menu. The food is AMAZING with fresh fruit, eggs made to perfection, good hot chocolate, NUTELLA, a unique cream cheese and lots of fresh juice. The juices alone can be made into a satisfying meal or desert. They also have gelato which I didn't get a chance to try. Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Very cool place in downtown Montreal to get some coffee and desserts. Just about everything is made from fresh fruits. You can't go wrong with one of the crepe or waffle combos. And the choices of the Natural Ice Creams is fantastic. Definitely a great place to either pop in and grab something to go or just to hang out on the outside Terrace and people watch and enjoy a really tasty and not so bad for you treat."}
{"text":"This ain't Hawaii...its like the DR or Puerto Rico.  You can't pull that shit on me....I lived in Hawaii.    Stop it  There's a palm tree in my giant meal, loaded with fruits."}
{"text":"A really good place for breakfast and general brunch foods. My boyfriend and I love it there--he always gets the \"tequila\" crepe with egg and cheese, which is absolutely delicious. Their smoothies are fresh and personalized to your own individual tastes. Compared to other places, it's pretty cheap for quality breakfast food. We're definitely going back there again!"}
{"text":"I went to Hawaii about 5 months ago and there is nothing in this store that resembles the beloved American Pacific island state. You might turn your nose at it from the outside; not only that, but the interior is kitschy and the lighting is absolutely gawdawful.   As a vegetarian, the clerk recommended a 'Mexican' crepe with rice. The vegetables were microwaved in hot water and then served with a salsa over it. Not impressive at all.  But what won me over about this place was the ginormous mug of fruit cocktail, topped with white Lebanese cheese, crushed pistachios and drizzled with honey. Great for a quick snack or a healthy dose of fruit. The portions are also way too large for an individual, so it would be perfect to share.  CONS: Zombies for clerks.  PROS: Huge portions and close to the Guy subway station."}
{"text":"Honestly I don't know why this place is getting such fantastic reviews or maybe I just ate the wrong thing? I ordered the asparagus, cheese and tomato crepe. It was dripping in oil, the asparagus came from a can and the cheese was tasteless. Not for me at all."}
{"text":"This place is a \"healthy\" and unique place to try. The décor isn't great, but it's kind of fun and reminds me of Latin American juice bars. You order and pay and the counter first. The food is fresh and you can watch everything prepared to order. The fruit cocktails are outstanding, the atayef are sublime, and the dessert crepes are tasty. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Got a late night nutella crepe here.  Made fresh.  I'll say that the crepes were a bit bigger, but does that satisfy the taste requirement?  Not particularly.  I wasn't impressed with the crepe flavor.    Not to mention, they didn't make the crepes any differently for those of us that want to walk home and eat a nutella crepe.  I had to improvise on my own."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff at Cocktail Hawaii...explains the dishes to you in detail. Needs to revamp the decor as it makes the place look silly and a bit dirty. Food was very good and the fruit was super fresh. Would go back."}
{"text":"My hubby & I went to try the new Allo! Mon Coco restaurant on De Maisonneuve. We left the establishment without eating (I'll have a review of that place shortly) and came upon Hawaii Cocktail, which is just down the street. I've seen this place numerous times while I've been downtown and never did I realize they offered breakfast! Thank goodness because we were pissed off and HUNGRY.   My husband ordered a breakfast-crepe wrap and I ordered a typical breakfast meal. The variety of fruits they give is wonderful... There's even mango, I never see any other place include mango as a side fruit. They don't do poached eggs so I got sunny side up. The bacon was well cooked, potatoes are super tasty, and overall we enjoyed our meals.   I agree that the decor could be updated, it wouldn't take much to freshen it up. The service was good, it's not a table service restaurant, you take a tray and order at the cash, then you go get your meal when it's ready. Saves yourself giving a tip, but you could tip if you want, I don't think they'll object!"}
{"text":"The place used to be my favourite for fresh fruit cocktail before. I used to frequent it for years before 2012. It used to be colorful and full of life. Now it is empty most of the time and the service is sluggish especially at night.  The decoration is getting old as well. It needs some change and also, the offered menu is getting yet-another-juice-bar.  Hopefully the service will improve soon because it used to be the gem of healthy variety in the area."}
{"text":"Cocktail Hawaii is a colourful non-pretentious juice bar filled with faux palm trees. Although this will not be a life changing experience, the ginormous mugs of fruit cocktails are delicious! My favourite is Laguna, half of the Hawaiian (strawberry, banana, milk and honey) and half of the Kamikaz (avocado, honey and milk). It is slightly on the almost cloyingly sweet side but still within tolerance.   I would recommend Nuit de Liban, a plate of achta and honey with banana, mango, strawberry, papaya and kiwi sprinkled with pistachios, almonds and raisins. To be honest, I am not sure why a place that serves Lebanese cream is offering a Hawaiian experience, but the refreshing fruit platter did make my belly rejoice.   P.S. Avoid the crepes. I had the Tropicana (strawberries, banana, mango topped with ice cream). The crepe had an off-putting texture."}
{"text":"The music is cool and the food is sooo great. I had a nutella & strawberry crepe. Love the smoothies too. A lowkey place that isn't always busy."}
{"text":"Neat spot. I did not order the right dish.... But I will try again. Fresh fruit is great and the pineapple mango juice in a beer mug is fun and tasty. I think the waffle or crepe would be best, not so much an egg and bacon spot. This is not a greasy spoon."}
{"text":"Kitch decoration .. open since 14 years already.. need renovation but they have many choices of juices and fruits cocktail with vegetables etc ... in a narrow glaces .. its too pricey .. but still good mmmmm"}
