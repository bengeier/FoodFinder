{"text":"I love this buffet! It is my FAVOURITE Chinese buffet in the GTA and all surrounding cities! i can just eat the peking duck! for $19/person for dinner? that's crazy!! the AYCE salmon sashimi and steamed fish help too! 

some of the comments mention that the quality isn't that great - but whenever i go it's great! the fish is fresh, the duck is crispy and the steamed fish is DELICIOUS (albeit a few scales ...) 

it's great for $19/person for dinner! :)"}
{"text":"This buffet is gross. The first time I ate it, I threw up a few hours later. I gave it another try with my friend and the honey chicken tasted like straight up ketchup. The food was just not good and it was such a big waste of money both times. I will not be going back again."}
{"text":"That was one of the most disgusting experience that I had in my life....very Bad FOOD  period!!"}
{"text":"This is the first authentic Chinese buffet I've experienced! Pretty cool, like going to grab dinner at a great little hole-in-the-wall spot in Chinatown, in buffet form. 

Don't go to China Buffet King expecting the Mandarin, 'cause here they haven't watered down tastes or recipes for the North American palate. If you've ever wanted to try (ecologically unsustainable) shark fin soup, or chicken feet, or *shudder* blood congee, this is the place to have a taste. And you won't need to worry if you hide it under your napkin to be whisked away by the waiter if it makes you queasy. 

The quality of the food is fair to middling. The quantity of the food is epic. Tons of choice here, so if you've got a big group everyone can find something. 

More pluses: 
Seems clean
Variety abounds
Servers are super nice + helpful
Crab legs on the buffet

Minuses:
Freshness is questionable (on weeknights)
Standard buffet prices ($25ish pp)
I had to watch my uncle eat three plates of crab legs"}
{"text":"One of our friends asks us to all meet there.  I haven't been to here for a long time. When I walk in from the back parking, I notice the place has deteriorated.  Further along the path into the main dining room, the carpet is worn and dirty.  The buffet counter is a bit messy without cleaning.  The food varieties have been reduced from what I recall.  

Worst of all is the toilet.  It is cold without heat and stinky.  The tiles are all broken.  How a restaurant be run like that.  My recommendation is not to come as there are a lot more Chinese buffet restaurants better than this one."}
{"text":"I recently went to the China King Buffet, because my parents kept saying how consistently good the food was. This could not be further from the truth and in fact, it was among the worst dining experiences that I've had in over a decade. This has to be among the worst Chinese buffets in the city. Listen to the others reviewers, the food is awful and your money would be better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. There was dust and dirt on the carpets. The food was not made well at all. I couldn't finish my food (not that I wanted to) because I was so grossed out by the look and cleanliness of the place. You're wasting your money if you go here."}
{"text":"Traditional chineese buffet. Food was hot, fresh and tasty. Lots of varieties. The staff was friendly and attentive on the drink refills. The decor is a bit dated but it is clean. The staff was continually wiping down areas and changing out the food with fresh offerings. I will definetely come back when I am in tje Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Expect to stuff your face and feel awful afterwards.  Great Chinese buffet experience.  Food hot and its clear there is a high turnover of tables.  For 7 bucks; Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Not great food but a lot of good food is A-Ok in my book. Things I like about this place:

1) 12.99 lunch buffet
2) has dimsum
3) so many options but gets a little crazy (crab legs beside the pizza tray)
4) though I didnt try it and find it unusual, has american breakfast items like eggs, bacon. 
5) a lot of parking
6) great dessert selection. If I counted right around 16 flavors of ice cream.
7) huge (and I mean huge) dining space

No likey:
1) japanese selection like maki and sushi was pretty substandard
2) no free drinks
3) a few items were barely passable 

I'd recommend this place to people who just want to eat a lot. Probably someone starving who just wants to pig out as soon as they get seated.
The food aint great, but you'll be satisfied."}
{"text":"China king Buffett was a  diamond in the rough. I was introduced to the restaurant 4 years ago and have been a customer ever since. Besides the grand view buffet at the casino and Tokyo Buffett in the north hills this is my favorite Chinese restaurant to recommend to folks traveling west on 376 . 

I try to base my reviews on quality, variety and price. The lunch Buffett will allow you to fully enjoy your time and you will never leave hungry."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it zero star. Horrible. The quality of food was terrible. Garbage. The waitress could notspeak English well. I asked for coka and they did not know what is the coke. Everything taste like socks. Spending a penny is too much for this place."}
{"text":"Came here for the all you can eat Peking duck!!!!

Peking duck is one of my favourite dishes ... so even if it is a mediocre duck, I am happy ... and I was relatively happy with the AYCE peking duck.  The wraps were the thin authentic kind.  The brown hoisin sauce was good.  There were cucumbers and shallots available.  And in my eyes, the duck was pretty good.  There was a fair amount of crispy fatty skin - DROOOL!!!!

I really loved the wraps ... towards the end, I was wrapping up everything in sight and drizzling it with hoisin sauce.

My husband was disappointed.  His palate is a little more discerning than mine when it comes to duck.  

This place also lost stars because the rest of the buffet was just not appetizing - to me.  The desserts were sad and unappealing.  There was a chocolate fountain but it was a little messy and kind of germy looking - lots of little kids were sticking their fingers and tongues in the fountain.  It was kind of cute and funny to watch but it did create a mess.

One of the positives of the place is that it is large.  There is even a seating area with couches and chairs.  Kids can run around this area to their hearts delight.  

The restaurant seemed a little run down and old ... like an old Las Vegas Buffet - off the strip.  

I had high hopes for this place but its just too mediocre for us to spend $30 on gas to travel here."}
{"text":"Place doesn't exist anymore!

I went up and down back and fourth, def nothing where that address is.

Nothing"}
{"text":"I don't usually like buffets because either they are horrible and I don't want to eat there again or they are amazing and I ate food coma worthy calorie bombs in each plate. 

These guys have delicious food in their buffet. I loved the sweet and sour and appreciate that they kept the sauce separate. The beef brocolli was good. The general tso was okay. I was in the mood for protein and sugar so that's mainly what I got...

They also had tons of fruits and some salad stuff... They had a decent selection of sugary options. The apple pie thing was like anywhere else. Pudding and jello. Yum. And the best was their Hersheys Ice Cream. My parents owned a convenience store and we sold tons of food including Hersheys Ice Cream. So right when I opened that fridge I jumped straight for the Moose Track and Butter Pecan. Oh my god Hersheys has those to flavors on point. Sorry I'm getting off track. This place was cheap offered tons of delicious food. And they had fast service. I think I gained 10 pounds..."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh from Michigan, was looking for a quick place to sit down after hours in the road.  It was after 6pm on Friday and we were hungry. My daughter loves Chinese buffet and our local said it was close to hotel.  It is tucked behind Wendy's; we passed it the first time.  The parking lot was sparse which worried me, but it was still early, I hoped.

The waitress was nice and efficient, refilling our lemonades constantly and finding lemons for me which is a staple in buffets in Michigan.  The food area was clean and I saw a woman consistently wiping the counters which I appreciate.  The food was standard fair, a little better than most.  My daughter didn't appreciate the sushi or lack of variety which is her favorite.  I had crab legs and peeled shrimp, not bad.  I don't eat much of the breaded stuff so I cannot review those.  I did try the peanut butter chicken which surprisingly I liked the sweet meat.  The ice cream was excellent only about 6 flavors.  I had jello with a tablespoon each of mint chocolate and butter pecan.  my daughter had mint chocolate and chocolate.  All were great!

it was a nice space with a quiet atmosphere.  Good for families and date nights.  The waitress gave us 2 fortune cookies with the bill.

Overall it was average to good experience and food wise, however not great.   I would come again if in the area."}
{"text":"I would rather never come here ever again. Came her many times before and they had a server that was really nice and every time I finished my food that would take my plates. But now she left and I come here often and this place is get ridiculous and server are getting more retarded. For example now the servers don't ask to refill my drink anymore and you might say if you want a refill you should ask them but it is not my job to ask them but its their job and they are the ones getting paid to do the task. Also they stopped taking our used plates it just sits in the table and no one collects them. The seats are dirty and the building is really old. Also if you are looking to find a god place to sit and eat in a quiet place this is not the place the dumb Chinese people talking really loudly that it feels like you dont want to eat anymore. DO NOT COME HERE.!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place! It has good down hill. Sad as the owner is very nice. As others say, it is clear stuff has been sitting too long as many dishes are dried out. Worse yet most of the food is ice cold! unacceptable!! 12$ and all that I could eat was the icecream. At least that was supposed to be cold"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in probably 10 years, but as soon as I stepped in, I remembered this as my FAVOURITE BUFFET when I was a kid. We would go here all the time because my brother and I were bottomless pits back then, and my grandparents were incredibly indulgent.

It's pretty much the same as it always was in terms of atmosphere. It's pretty standard in terms of being a Chinese restaurant, but there are some neat points to it. There's a children's area where they have big leather sofas and a kid's movie playing on a big TV. There was a room behind the buffet area where a Korean couple were having their wedding reception. It's a huge spot and it was host to three different big parties while we were there.

Food-wise, it's pretty decent for a buffet. For one thing, it was lunch time and they had actual salmon sushi instead of just \"crab\" and california rolls. It was made right in front of you, and they were pretty quick about it, so it was surprisingly fresh. They also had dim sum, which was nice. The winner, though, was the breakfast/brunch buffet section. It was a section with scrambled eggs, bacon, breakfast sausage... basically Canadian breakfast staples. I didn't have any, but I think I found a new place to take my husband, who is pretty set in his ways when it comes to the first meal of the day.

I'm definitely coming back, with my bottomless pit friends.

Oh and parking tip: park in the back of the building, it's the closest to the actual restaurant, which is in the basement of the plaza."}
{"text":"Not bad if you're in Greentree/Noblestown Road area and just want to munch but, this place is definetly in the bottom tier of Asian/Chinese buffets in PGH. area.  A lot of it is very oily and there's a taste that seems to permeate throughout the various dishes. gets a lot of business from greentree office-workers ."}
{"text":"Decent food buy WAYYY too expensive. $13.50 dinner price is outrageous. I'd rather go to an actual Chinese place like Sesame Inn and get very high quality food for much less."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is highly suggested the first time you go here. I don't usually do dinner because of the price, but I'm not a crab leg in Pittsburgh fan so it's not worth the extra to me."}
{"text":"Variety but hot food is too cold, or maybe has been sitting for too long, we were stopped cuz we went to get something third time.  I don't like to pile up my plate, so I enjoy little bit at a time, but according to them I was going too many times.... losers"}
{"text":"Their chicken and brocolli is just YUM!!! There have been several times where I had to go just because of that for a very far places. Overall, its a bit noisy and staff is really loud all the time."}
{"text":"This place is a little above average Chinese buffet. I was quick to be seated, and quick to get my drink that was ordered at the same time. During lunch it wasn't too crowded. The assortment of foods was abundant with a hot and cold station. It also had a fried station with some American foods as well(pizza, fries, chicken wings, etc). There were some desserts, sushi, and even ice cream. I had the chicken and broccoli which was hot, fried rice, some egg rolls, and wonton soup. All were very good. for the price of lunch $7.75 it is worth it. Everyone I was with also enjoyed what they ate. We will be returning for lunch"}
{"text":"I really can't figure out why my husband loves this place so much and I only go there when it's his turn to choose dinner. I feel like this buffet has gone down hill over the years. Last time we were there, everything was cold and picked through and it was fairly early into dinner (around 6:15 pm)."}
{"text":"Great buffet with a lot of choices. I'll be back again. Clean, roomy, and bright. Good chives of desserts. Even saw the staff eating the food so it must be good."}
{"text":"I was in the area and craving quick Chinese so I figured I'd give it a shot.  

I would rate it ok at best.  I arrived at 7:30ish to a place advertised to be open until 10.  There was one other table in the entire HUGE restaurant.  

Most of the buffet was picked over and you could tell that it had been sitting out for a while.  I asked if they would be refreshed and was told \"we closing soon\"  It was 7:30 and the sign on the door said they were open until 10.  

The best thing I ate was the sweet and sour chicken.  That isn't saying much considering that an easy and fairly bland dish that is.  But the chicken had a good texture and the breading was right.  They had a lot of dishes that I enjoy, but most were dried out or almost empty.  The coconut shrimp looks like it would have been very tasty, but all that remained in the dish were remnants of sauce and one lonely shrimp.   I tried both the hot and sour and won ton soup.  The wonton soup had good flavor, but the won tons were dried out, again probably because they had been sitting a while.  The hot and sour was not horrible but not great either.
Service was nonexistent.  I had to go to the register area (where the person was playing games on her phone) in order to ask for a refill on my water.  
Not a great overall experience and the food was meh, but for the price, ($10) you aren't spending that much more then you would have on fast food and had a larger variety."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Don't understand all the negative reviews. 

What do people expect from a low-price buffet restaurant?"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend because there were decent reviews and members talked about how good the sushi was.... There were only two types of sushi and no soy sauce to be found anywhere in the restaurant. The place smelled awful and the bathroom resembled a sewer. The food tasted like river water, and any dish that contained dairy basically smelled and tasted like vomit. Not an expensive place, but for how much the buffet cost definitely not worth it. My boyfriend- who enjoys shitty buffets even said- the worst Chinese buffet I have ever been to; don't waste your time."}
{"text":"this one remaind me good times,it was one week after my birthday my friends of mine invited me there for a surprise party for me it was my first time to go there, they even bought a birthday cake by themselves from outside but guess what, in a buffet! a place full of dessert and sweet things  we couldn't even start eating the cake! btw i'm so thankful to them for that it was very thoughtful of them :) 

Anyway, basically  buffets are always great you can get lots of food for a cheap price per person but the point is i don't like Chinese foods very much i mean whats point of not having a meat that you can say with confidence  ok \"this is it!.... i know what this meat made of \" the thing im try to is i couldn't find a real taste of steak at all buffet, instead you there was a plenty of frog legs! good thing is they had chicken roast which is good because chicken is always chicken! they had peperoni  pizza too.

But I liked the dessert including: ice-creams,cakes, desserts in any culture are good and sweet :P in salads you have a variety of choices and for fruit melons and oranges and strawberries ...

after all it was a ok place"}
{"text":"Even though the last time we are her my wife got food poisoning we still decided to give it another shot as we er hungry and wanted buffet. The building is mess and the only thing that let's you know is porn are the cars in the lot.   We walk in and the guy behind the count is talking to one of the buffet servers. I say excuse me after waiting some time snd he turns to use with an agitated look say just wait I have to talk to her. At which point we turn around snd wakj out abd decided on Thai food instead."}
{"text":"China Buffet King is a more authentic version of the Mandarin Chinese buffet. For those unfamiliar, this is an Asian all-you-can-eat buffet with \"over 250 items\" located in Richmond Hill (north of Toronto).  Access to this restaurant is best from the back of the plaza beside the \"H Mart\". Ample parking is available but often full on the weekends because of the popularity, large capacity (hundreds of seats) and price of this establishment.

I have to be honest I don't love coming here due to the crowd but if you have to go to a buffet (for family or simplicity reasons) I much prefer China Buffet King to their rivals.  

The weekend lunch menu is quite typical starting with the soup section featuring congee, egg-drop and wonton soups.  A modest salad bar provides the requisite greens for the non-Asians (salad is not a typical Chinese dish).  The staples such as fried noodles and rice, spring rolls, sweet and sour chicken balls, spare-ribs, deep-fried wings and the list goes on.  

The feature items include a decent dimsum bar with freshly made dumplings, buns and others small edibles.  A popular sushi-bar is also present with various rolls (salmon, California, etc.) and actual salmon sushi with fairly generous sized slices and normally sized rice balls.  Typically at AYCE sushi places the salmon is sliced paper-thin and the rice is plus-sized.  Only problem, they have the slowest and oldest chef preparing them to artificially metre their consumption (think short supply).

To finish off your meal there's a dessert bar consisting of many flavours of ice-cream and a variety of baked items and fruit.  Nothing fantastic but most are nice to end the meal on a sweet note.

Service is actually a cut above their food with helpful and friendly staff.  Again I'm not a fan of China Buffet King but in terms of food and price (~$25 for a weekend lunch) it is of decent value and quality."}
{"text":"**** CLOSED ****

Was here today only to find it has closed.  Too bad, it had a huge selection of food but I guess the quality declined as prices increased."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese buffet, and I LOVE Chinese buffets. The dumplings are fantastic. The General Tso is nice and tangy, and the pepper steak is deliciously salty. The hot and sour soup is better than at most a la carte places. Plus the \"fried\" category of food is extensive, and good. I love that they offer real Hershey's ice cream, including moose tracks, instead of the nasty ice milk at most buffets. They do not offer a ton of American selections, which I think is a good thing. The service is more attentive and friendly than other buffets.
 I only hesitate to give 5 stars because if they are not crowded, the turnaround on dishes can be slow. Also, they always have the exact same dishes. I like it when there are always the old standbys, but some new rotating dishes as well. 
Overall, if you are looking for some solid Chinese buffet food, this is the place to come."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a buffet freak. He could eat one for breakfast, lunch and dinner if he could. I, on the other hand, enjoy buffets but only on occasion. Buffets are nice because you can take what you what and try new things, however sometimes when I go out to eat I just want to sit and have somebody bring me my food. 

Last night I caved and agreed to go here to make him happy. Was it bad? No, not really. Was it good? Ehh, I've had worse. The best way I can describe this is really just your typical run-of-the-mill Chinese buffet. It's nothing spectacular, yet you'll still be able to find something you'll like. 

As I mentioned in previous reviews, I like the more \"American\" Chinese food like Pineapple Chicken. There is no shortage of this kind of food as they also have a few American dishes like fried shrimp, chicken bites and onion rings. One thing I enjoyed was their coconut shrimp. It was probably one of the best I've ever had. It was unusually creamy (in a good way) and had a sweet taste that wasn't too strong. 

The biggest disappointment for me was their crab rangoons. Not only was the amount of stuffing extremely unappetizing, but it was way too sweet. I'm not too much of a sweets person so I was turned off. It made me sad because I really enjoy my crab rangoons! That's one food that's usually a guarantee score for me at a Chinese buffet. That being said, all of the food seemed up to temp and watched carefully by the staff. 


The place itself is a little dated but what do you expect for a place like this? It was 7:30 at night and we were one of the three or four tables there. I will say that the employees are very friendly and the woman who took our check (I'm assuming she's the owner), thanked us several times and really seemed like she appreciated us coming in. If it wasn't for the kind staff, I probably would have given this place two stars. Customer service goes a long way!"}
{"text":"China Buffet King is a good, traditional Chinese Buffet restaurant. It is located directly behind the Wendy's on Noblestown Road, so it is easy to miss unless your looking for it. Good food, good service. About what you would expect from a restaurant like this. Price is reasonable as well!"}
{"text":"Really awful, the place was empty thus all the food was either cold or very dry. Avoid at all costs. I wish ponderosa would move back in!"}
{"text":"Good food. And the waitress leaves you alone...until you need a refill on drinks."}
{"text":"When comparing this buffet to its direct competitors like Star Walk and Mandarin it certainly wins over by a lot.
The food here is always fresh and they try to replenish it often. During dinner they have your regular salad bar, fresh shrimps and mussels (good quality and size), 5-6 choices of soups (some European and some Chinese), tempura, absolutely delicious Peking duck , sushi and sashimi (salmon and tuna rolls and well as fito roll and California roll), crab legs and general variety of Szechuan cuisine. For the dessert there is ice-cream, waffles and lots of cakes and jellos as well as fresh fruits. So there are lots of choices. Everything is kept clean and the manager monitors the floor at all times. Lunch is a little simpler, there is no sashimi, shrimps, crabs, tempura and the duck, but there are about 8 choices for Dim Sum, which are great. 
The service is variable, sometimes swift and sometimes slow, but it is a buffet and all you want is for your table to be kept clean. The reason for star off is because their crab legs are not the same quality you see in Mandarin, they are small and salty, so I would not put them on the menu at all. But everything else compensates the crab legs with ease.
As with every buffet it is beneficial to come early, especially for dinner, however they strive to keep everything available until the last moment.
So if you can stretch you stomach then go ahead and give this place a try."}
{"text":"I think some of the reviews are a little harsh. Not the greatest buffet I ever had, but certainly not the worst. Been here a few times, some experiences better than others. Here today, and I'm glad I made the choice. Everything tastes hot, and was good. Friendly waitress. Plenty of food choices, will be back again."}
{"text":"I saw the other low ratings, but I was feeling brave and hungry from an intense Krav Maga session at Wright's Gym down the street.  What I got for my bravery was low quality food at low prices.  

The place was almost empty, and the food ranged from mediocre to downright inedible.  All the vegetables had been left under heat lamps so long they were neither solid, nor liquid, but some abomination between.  They had a fairly wide selection, but unfortunately it all tasted (at best) bland and the same.  

Pittsburgh is home to many great asian buffets, this is the worst one I've been to here by far.  I hope you'll be wiser than I was.  Heed the low yelp rating and save yourself some disappointment."}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far the worst buffet I have ever been to.  The lady who owns the place couldn't be any more horrible to the customers.  Half of the buffet bins were empty and don't even think about the crab legs.  Absolutely the worst crab legs ever.  How do you screw up crab legs you ask?  They tasted like they sat in salt water for 2 weeks.  The crabs were mushy and salty.  And the only time they brought out the crab legs is when I asked them to.  Which of course they got pissy about. When I asked them to fill the pineapple chicken...someone stormed into the back...came out with chicken nuggets...threw them in the empty pineapple chicken tray that did still have some of the sauce left in it.....then she went over to the salad bar and grabbed a handful of pineapple and threw it in the pineapple chicken container.....I couldn't believe my eyes.  Horrible staff...an even worse owner....horrible food....Stay away from this place.....seriously."}
