{"text":"Their food is amazing, their service is frequent, the atmosphere is appropriate and clean, prices are very decent, and they offer delivery!

If I had to make one complaint, it would be that the outside of their restaurant isn't the nicest-looking, but that's hardly anything."}
{"text":"We were going to head into Toronto for Indian food after we finished off an apointment in Whitby but our apointment went late and we got very hungry and ended up here instead. What a great experience it was! I was not expecting much from an Indian place in Whitby but I was so pleasantly surprised. There service was excellent. The waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly and she was very helpful with picking items on the menu that were gluten free. I overheard the waitress talk with another table about a peanut allergy and once again she was very knowledgeable and helpful. The food was above average. The portions were a good size and the freshness of the food stood out. One dish was a little on the over spicey side so I recommend you ask how spicey a dish is if you don't like to much spice. They have an extensive lunch menu with very reasonable prices and they have plenty of gluten free options for those who are gluten free. I highly recomend this place! Overall an excellent experience, I caint wait to go back."}
{"text":"Best Tandoori and Palak Paneer in town. Lovely service overlooking the St Lawrence Market."}
{"text":"Best authentic Indian food in Durham! 
The service was great and the staff was really helpful in helping us pick a vegetable curry. Ordered the butter chicken, chicken biryani, naan and the spinach paneer curry. Everything was delicious, spices and flavour were all there. The portions were great too. Even their serving dishes looked authentic.
Had the left overs the following day and it was still delicious!"}
{"text":"We went here with another couple and family, the food was great and flavourful.

They have a lot of authentic tasting north Indian food on their menu, with some dishes that you might not be able to order at other indian restaurants.

I had the Bagara Baingan which is an eggplant based dish and it was wonderful, my g/f ordered the Malai Kofta which wasn't as good, which is why they get 4 stars instead of 5.

In all there was 6 of us and we had 6 meals, plus rice, naan, two drinks, everyone else had water and the bill came up to $90, we will go here again.

If you are in the area and craving some indian food, please stop by here.

Be patient, service is slow, which makes be believe they make everything fresh."}
{"text":"I've been to so many Indian restaurants in the GTA, including downtown Toronto, and nothing compares to Signature. Their dishes just have so much more flavour and complexity. They aren't afraid to lay on the heat when you ask for it too!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from Signature. Order several dishes for pick up. I'm picky when it comes to ordering Indian cuisine from places that I haven't tried or been referred to me by family or friends

Pros: good size portions, told it would be over an hour but ready in 45. Glad I called to follow up. Good amount of chicken in all of the dishes.

Con: Based on other reviews, expected a fair amount of spice. Wasn't the case at all. I would rate the spice level as mild. My fault for not asking for a higher level of spice.
Garlic Naan was partially burnt. Didn't discover until we opened up the package.
Flavour wise, I would rate a 2/5. seemed to be really lacking in most of the dishes. Disappointing based on what other reviews indicated. Maybe it was the fact that the spice level was mild. 
Some of the chicken in the Butter chicken was burnt.  Never experienced this before. Almost indicates that the chicken was cooked separately and then added instead of marinating in the sauce. 
Would I order from Signature again.... not sure."}
{"text":"We mostly order delivery from Signature on a Friday or Saturday night, but I have also ordered lunch there.  Bottom-line, fantastic food.  While it's pretty much the only game in town, it luckily for us is one of the best Indian Cuisines in Durham.  Butter Chicken, Madras, Jalfrieze, Aloo Gobi all excellent, and they deliver!  Try the dinner special for two - you cannot go wrong and it's a ton of food...you will have leftovers."}
{"text":"Simply the best food in Durham.
I like Indian food, it is not in my top 4th type of food, but Signatures is definitely a place that I always look to go.
The service is very friendly.
The restaurant is very simple in decor. It is located in a plaza; not very welcoming when you see it from outside. However once you try their food, you definitely go back. Several great choices in their menu also for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Came in to eat close to the closing time and the food was amazing. Very tasty and the perfect spice level which they allow you to choose.

Bottom line the food is amazing and the customer service is great!"}
{"text":"I recently tried chicken pakora for the first time, so I looked up a place in Whitby near my house where I could get some. I found Signature India and decided to give it a try. It was really good. A nice blend spices, breading, and one of the dipping sauces was sweet which just gave it that extra something. The prices are also decent!!! Plan on going back soon :)"}
{"text":"Pros: Great taste, great quantity of food. Friendly service, clean environment.

Cons: Long wait times for service.

I'd like to say there's a better spot in Durham region for Indian food but so far this restaurant has hit the top of the list. The food is well prepared, tastes delicious and was in great quantities - I was stuffed (and I usually eat enough Paneer to supply a small village). The only downside is the wait to get the food, or get your bill at the end of the meal, can be quite long. Otherwise, the staff is an absolute delight - would recommend if you're in the area and craving indian food.

Would I come back? Yes."}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times and have never been too impressed. Did not
enjoy the butter chicken at all and the burtha dish had huge chunks of eggplant oppose to having it liquified like every other Indian place I've been too. The nan bread was good, spice level was moderate and my friend enjoyed her meal."}
{"text":"We went here with two other couples to celebrate a friends birthday. The place was clean and well decorated, and the staff friendly and attentive. Service was a little slow, but it was busy and we weren't too bothered as we enjoyed taking our time and talking over dinner.

Everyone was really pleased with the quality and taste of the food, including one of our friends who was trying indian for the first time. They also brought out an extra meal that no one had ordered, but they left it for us and did not add it to the bill. We spent a long time in the restaurant but we just enjoyed our meals and the company.

The best part was how much we paid. Everyone had at least one alcoholic drink, an app, and with 8 meals, 8 orders of rice and two orders of Naan, we paid roughly $60 per couple (not including tip). It was a great experience and we will certainly go back for dinner the next time we're out that way!"}
{"text":"Legitimately one of the best Indian meals I have had in a long time! The Chicken Tikka Masala and Naan were incredible! Loved the small business charm and care that went into the cooking and service. If you are in the mood for Indian this is the place to be, no doubt about it!"}
{"text":"My mom and I were looking for something new when we arrived at Signature. It's one of those places you hear good things about from everyone; haven't heard a negative comment yet and you won't see one here. Most of the people we know that frequent this place order takeout and there was no shortage of people picking up on a Saturday afternoon! The d√©cor is comfortable and rich in deep reds and gold. When I say comfortable, I mean it; the seats are soft and cushy.  

We were there for a weekend lunch and we're kind of new to Indian food. We asked a lot of questions and the owner was very patient with our newbie questions. Our definition of 'hot' is definitely different than hers and I can only imagine how many times she is asked if something is 'hot'. She let us know what is the least hot and away we went.  

We started with the Chicken Pakora. Why doesn't EVERYONE spice batter like this?! Oh my goodness, every other batter will now seem bland after this. It came with 2 sauces a mild chutney and a spicy yogurt sauce. Fantastic. The pieces of chicken were a good size and the sauces complimented the pakora well. 

The lunch prices are fantastic; less than $8 a plate! Your dish comes with a healthy serving of rice. You can't go wrong. As a test of heat level, we tried Butter Chicken and Curry Chicken. So, we went a little crazy on the chicken. We also ordered fresh naan. Mmmmmm. My butter chicken was fantastic with the perfect heat level for someone like me. Yes, my nose was running and I was sweating, but I enjoyed every second! The creamy, savoury goodness of the sauce made that naan disappear fast. My mom's curry had about the same heat level, maybe slightly more, but she, with her runny nose and sweating, enjoyed it. We've been back since our initial visit and I cannot tear myself away from the chicken pakora or butter chicken. I even converted my mom to butter chicken, since I've had it so many times. 

I know they have other fantastic dishes and one day I will try them. I've heard good things about their vindaloo, but I don't think I'm there quite yet. I'm excited to try one of their Tandoor Specialties.....if the Butter Chicken doesn't suck me back in. 

After a lot of savoury, we needed some sweet and were curious about the dessert selection. Was there a dessert menu? There was! We went with the Gulab Jamun. It consisted of 3 spongy milk balls(same size as Timbits) soaked in a light sugar syrup. It was perfect after a meal like this. I think if I tried these without a spicy meal, they would've been too sweet, but this was great. 

A delightful experience each time and I'll continue to go back. If you can't dine in, get take out, you will be back!"}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly, attentive, and kind! The food is absolutely delicious and the menu has great variety.
I recommend the naan bread, it's always hot and it's the best naan I've ever had out of any Indian cuisine place I've been to."}
{"text":"Our favourite Indian food restaurant in Durham!! Delicious food, amazing flavours. Warning ... even a medium is spicy!! But so good!  It's usually a bit of a slow wait to get your food but knowing it's so freshly made, is no problem with us. We get take out from here at least once a month."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and both times it was very good. 

The good:
1- my meals were excellent. My favorite has been the mushroom kaju Matar, I highly recommend it.
2- their rice is perfect. I don't know how they do it, but it is so good. The naan is not exceptional, but it is hard to find perfect naan and it is definitely pretty good. 
3- There is plenty of parking. 
4- The service is good. They offered extra napkins when I went with my one year old niece. And the staff want you to have a good experience, I get the impression that they like what they do.
5- My brother-in-law who thinks he isn't the biggest fan of indian food likes the food here including the Vindaloo. 
6- The prices are very reasonable. 

The not so good:
1- the food takes a while to make it to your plate from the time you order it. But like I mentioned above, it is worth the wait.
2- it can be tricky to find the first time you go. Both my sister and I passed it the first time. If you are coming from the west on Kingston, be sure to turn into the parking lot just past Licks. 

Overall, it is good and I would recommend it to anyone. Just make sure you aren't in a rush to go anywhere afterwards. 

I have to say that I have yet to have their chai. Next time I go, I'll be sure to try it. But if you have been please let me know what you think. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up ready on time hot delicious and lots of it! We had curry for 5 meals there were only 2 of us!

We ordered butter chicken, goat curry the chefs appetizer platter and garlic naan.

I can't describe how delicious it was!

Go there you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Such amazing Indian food. We ordered the signature dinner for 2 the first time we tried this and it's more like a dinner for 5. We didn't mind all the delicious left overs. Have been back 3 times since and can't wait to have it again. Butter chicken is obviously my favorite. I literally drink the sauce at the end. Yum."}
{"text":"The food was superb as well as the customer service!  I had paneer kulcha and Ahloo palak (which lasted me a couple days) thanks to their generous portions. The basmati rice was super delish as well"}
{"text":"Great food and service! I called in for takeout, I was told that they were busy and she apologized in advance if she had to put me on hold, which she did a couple times but still managed to promptly get my order and recommended something absolutely delicious for my vegan diet. After realizing that we placed two orders of naan, she called me back 20 minutes later to let me know that they weren't dairy free. I really appreciate a restaurant going out of their way during a busy time. I really appreciate them going out of their way for that, having vegan options, and putting the same concerns on my diet restrictions as I would myself. Also, throughout the whole experience she referred to me by my first name and never sounded impatient with me. Five stars out of five!"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Authentic Indian food, period.

This place can be easy to miss as it's located in a weird corner of a plaza, but it serves very solid Indian food - and by very solid, I don't mean by Whitby's standard, but solid, period. The interior is fairly bare bones, the service is fair, and the prices are good. The chef is an elderly Indian lady who I've never seen so much as duck her head out of the kitchen, but I can tell you that she don't play - her dishes use authentic spices, and they have a lot of kick to 'em. This place is definitely one of my go-to places in Whitby. 

The ONION BHAJIS and the VEGETABLE PAKORAS are light and crispy, and the side sauces are both refreshing and spicy. One of my favourite dishes is the LAMB VINDALOO, with a nice rich and spicy sauce. The CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA is very flavourful. If you can't take much spice, then I'd recommend the BUTTER CHICKEN or the MATAR PANEER (hmmmmm, paneer!). Your dishes come with rice, though if you're in a group, I'd recommend adding a GARLIC NAAN."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was a little skeptical of this place, based on their location on the front staff as they weren't Indian and I was wondering about the authenticity of the cuisine. We were pleasantly surprised! Service was very attentive and friendly and they seemed very well versed and knowledgeable about the dishes that they serve, Both cuisine and food were outstanding as well."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I wouldn't go back though. I ordered the samosa chaat and butter chicken. The butter chicken was very tomato-y, it remnded me more of pasta sauce than anything. The samosa chaat was good but it wasn't chaat, it was a samosa served in a hot gravy. Try Serena Grill down the road, amazing butter chicken and samosa chaat!"}
