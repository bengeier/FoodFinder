{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice now and have had the best experience! The food come out hot and ready fast! The vegan options are so good! You HAVE to get the curry fries!!!"}
{"text":"Best time at killer shrimp thanks to Joy loved it and would go back !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice bar inside whole foods market. Very spacious sitting area and lots of beer on tap to chose from."}
{"text":"This place has quickly become a favorite bar of mine! At first I'm not going to lie, with it being inside Whole Foods I was a bit hesitant but lucky for me I tried it and glad I did. 

Service is that of a local everyone knows everyone type of vibe bar. Entire staff is super friendly and they know their beers. 

Take advantage of the great happy hour 4pm-7pm which includes all draft beers and a couple of food selections. Also if u not sure which beer u would like, don't be afraid to ask to sample it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night and there were only two other parties seated, one at the bar, and one at a table. I opted to get a salad here to go. I went with the heart of Palm salad and added the organic chicken for $5. The salad stated it had arugula, heirloom carrots, avocado, heart of palm, and radish with a jalape√±o vinaigrette. I asked to sub the vinaigrette with the sesame one from the other salad which they happily did. 

Portion size for to go was pretty small especially for a $15 salad ($16.22 with tax). The chicken was super dry and overcooked lol I had to try to soak it in as much dressing as I can fish from the bottom of the bowl. I was looking forward to heirloom carrots because I LOVE heirloom carrots but they used regular shaved carrots which was disappointing. And lastly, there was no avocado! That was one reason I  ordered this salad and no sight of even one. I wondered if it would have been different if I didn't order it to-go, idk. Well I  know I won't be back. I would have been more satisfied if I created my own salad from whole foods for sure lol.."}
{"text":"A bar/restaurant inside a grocery store?! Having moved from Virginia (a state where Whole Foods Markets are known for housing several fantastic restaurants under one roof)...I was excited to find that there was a hot food option (besides the hot food bar paid by the pound).

I got the Pub Burger ($12) and was surprised by how simple but delicious it was. Grass fed beef, pickled red onions, roasted garlic aioli, and bacon jam...this burger is doing everything right! Unlike other restaurants that pile topping after topping on their burgers, the pub burger here satisfies any burger craving without too much added on. Fries were also perfectly hot & crispy  + the organic ketchup= :)

Happy Hour runs Monday-Friday from 4-7PM. The pub burger is part of the specials offered....if anything, save a couple dollars & treat yourself to a burger that won't disappoint.

Service was a tad slow, but the server also doubles as the bartender. She was very friendly and helpful given the circumstances. 

I'll be back for happy hour, lunch, snack...let's be honest: whenever I shop at Whole Foods."}
{"text":"Very delicious vegan options. Had the beyond burger, the avocado sushi roll and the cauliflower nachos! So DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Can I just put one of these in every Whole Foods location?!? Oh my goodness you guys, the vegan food here is seriously legit. And what is even better is the beer selections that they have to go with your vegan food! 

Please do yourself a favor and order the cauliflower nachos. You'll have regrets for the rest of your life if you skip this. I promise you. Crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside, with thinly sliced peppers for some heat and avocado cream to cool it down. Nice balance of flavors and textures. 

The Beyond Burger...wow. Just. Wow. You've got layers of flavors on the bun. 

But the beer selection on tap?!? There's a Blueberry Basil Kombucha Beer and a Mango Ginger Kombucha Beer on tap that's crisp and refreshing like a cider. 

And if you have room for dessert, get the vegan chocolate cake. Ya'll...I'm in heaven!! 

Now how do I pack these guys up and take them home??? :)"}
{"text":"Melissa is totally amazing. Come to see her for sure. My daughter wants to just for her Harry Potter Art work.  Love the pictures thanks. A good size list of beer on tap.  Folk music in Vegas. I will be back for sure. Not a dive bar by any stretch. Bright airy and the food is fresh and healthy. Everything you expect in a Whole Foods."}
{"text":"I pretty much love this place and sprocket... Vegan sushi rolls... Amazing veggies... Cauliflower nachos... Seriously... Oh and the beast burger (vegan) was on point (they gave us a sample). It's located inside whole foods town sq... They offer happy hour Monday-Friday from 3-6pm (beer and wine). 

The service was decent... And ambiance was a little bright in comparison to the photos I've see on Yelp. They did have the cooking channel and hgtv on which We were stoked about... They offer plenty of non vegan options as well with an eclectic menu from breakfast to dinner. 

We grocery shopped after dinner and had dessert at home in bed. Overall, it was a great experience and we will definitely be back! I'm still waiting for a location to open at the Charleston and ft Apache location."}
{"text":"This bar inside the Whole Foods caters to the off the Strip tourism as well as locals who are on their lunch breaks. Their menu attracts both pub crawl options and vegetarian diets. Try their avocado toast or burger, either way the portions are appropriate and the beer selection on tap is extensive. Just be patient as the bartender is often the server and waiting on a minimum of 10 people at once."}
{"text":"Happy hour 4 to 6, $5 beers.   Good selection,  some great daily specials.  Keeping that GMO out of your body."}
{"text":"The drinks at the LV Bar were refreshing, delicious and the service amazing. Amy the bartender, was friendly and nice. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Just stopped in to Whole Foods from the airport to pickup sandwiches and stopped into the LV Bar In the store.  Great concept, a bar in a grocery store!   Bartenders Morgan and  Melissa took good care of us.   Great bar menu with very reasonably priced wines by the glass.   Makes grocery shopping a lot more fun!"}
{"text":"Inside whole foods, yes a bar inside!!!
The tap list is amazing! Lots of local & regional beers, plus some from back East and Europe...
(1000 IPA from Denmark was amazing)

They also have a decent, bar food menu. Our food was great...and reasonably priced for the area.

I was told you can even go buy beer from the store & bring it inti LV Bar to drink it... a nice alternative.
They said they fill glass growlers, but it was $$$ as they charge by the pint price, no deals there.

Our server was great...both friendly & helpful.

A must return often for us!"}
{"text":"A fun atmosphere and really good people. It was all good vibes when I went during the daytime. It was very chill and I had an enjoyable experience tasting a variety of beers. I will probably come back the next time I'm in the area and the Hospitality was quite pleasant."}
{"text":"At the Whole Foods at Town Square the restaurant/brewery is called the LV Bar.  The menu is seasonal like at Sprockets on Green Valley  so it changes from time to time.

Our server was really nice and was helpful in drink selection and saving money.

Everything is awesome here, you really can't go wrong.  All the food is made fresh to order.  It's a great place with a daily happy hour.  You can order food & drink here or grab something from inside the store and bring it in.  This is a good place to check out."}
{"text":"LV Bar is located inside of the Whole Foods at Town Square. I was very pleased with most of the food we ordered. The vegan sushi was excellent. We also tried the vegan Beast Burger, which was also great. The pizza we ordered was awful. The crust tasted like it was made from animal crackers. I love animal crackers, just not on my pizza. Everything else was great though. The server was also very nice. I think she was the only person working there and she was very attentive. Great service!

I will definitely be back. Excellent food!! 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went here after work it was nice a bit under staff but overall impress.. this could be better but just don't know what's missing

First off inside a wholes food market I stop by had a drink and a bite to eat then went shopping but I felt a bit odd. 

It was a nice change being able to eat and drink to relex before shopping probably save me a little money they have like 20 something beers on tap and a good selection 

Just maybe the feeling of it I'm not used to... to me it feels odd"}
{"text":"Unexpected location (inside a Whole Foods) aside, the food here is worth getting, and is reasonably priced (good compensation for the inevitable accompanying trip to Whole Wallet). I had two vegan sushi rolls; the orchid roll was (by far) the more impressive roll, and had a nice assortment of flavors in i. At $5 it is a good deal and something I would order again."}
{"text":"Great little bar inside whole with nice vegan options I had the beyond vegan burger I added Avocado to it was pretty good. I will be back to try other things"}
{"text":"Ever wish you could take a break from all that grocery shopping and just sit down, relax, and enjoy a refreshing craft beer, glass of wine, and/or a delicious meal or snack, all without even leaving the store? Well, now you can.

This isn't your run of the mill little food counter, either. Sit at the bar or at one of many tables in a comfortable lounge type setting neatly carved out of one front corner of the store. And, yes, sports fans, there plasma screens for you.

And the best part is that get all of the friendly, attentive service and tasty high quality food you've come to expect from Whole Foods Market.

Or, maybe the best part is that they have happy hour from 4 to 6, with special menu items.

Or, maybe it's the 24 taps...

I can't decide :)"}
