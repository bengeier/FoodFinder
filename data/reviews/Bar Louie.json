{"text":"This place is wonderful I had my wedding reception there in the basement VIP section. Service was great food is very decently priced. Wednesday night drinks are only 1 bucks"}
{"text":"Have been here numerous times in the past with friends.  Service/food has always been good.  Especially for the HH prices... Blue Moon for 3.00 oh yeah!   Dissappointed last night.  As usual we headed for the patio, found a table and waited nearly 10 minutes for water, after the waitress saw us and said she'd be right back.  It took nearly 10 minutes to get a beer and menus...  We barely had time to scarf down the yummy wings and pot stickers before we had to leave for a show.  We had to wait and wait for our bill.    Left a small tip for the pitiful service last night.  Told the waitress crappy service equals a crappy tip.     I will be back, enjoy the atmosphere, patio and casualness of the place."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last few months and I must say the greetings are Extremely! Welcoming!...more so with Corita & Catrina know how to make a guest feel recognized, appreciated and welcomed. Bar-none my experience with Bar Louie is second to none!...HOOOORAH"}
{"text":"Drink specials are on point. BILLY is amazing. He came up and asked how are our experience was and came back 10 minutes later with shots for our party. One persons in our party was allergic to an ingredient in the shot so he came back with a different shot. Amazing customer service, will definitely be back"}
{"text":"My friends and I went down to the waterfront to enjoy some shopping and have dinner. Everywhere was pretty busy so when we went into Bar Louie we were not upset it took at least ten minutes for a server to come to our table. He immediately brought our waters over and we ordered drinks. Only another 30 minutes until he brought ONE martini over. We ordered our food and after talking to management it still took 45 minutes and our order was messed up. We tried to be understanding when we learned it was only our servers first day but you would think that management would try to help the poor guy out! He didn't get out of the weeds for the 2 hours we were there. Very disappointing and embarrassing on managements part. We weren't the only people having horrible service because when we looked around the bar everyone was upset. I hope they will let the server get some more experience rather than feeding him to the wolves on the second day."}
{"text":"Let's start with a little background.  The place is a chain, when large chain restaurants come to town they have to hire a mostly new staff that has never worked together before, many not for that particular company.  This is what we got during our visit, a disjointed staff, the waitress was good, one of the entrees was not made by the kitchen when the other two came out, both our waitress and the manager assured us they would comp the late entr√©e, however when the bill came it had not been comped, after asking the waitress she corrected it.  Side note, where we sat was near where the manager spent most of his time, and one of his apparently close friends was in there taking up most of his time, probly not the best idea during the dinner rush, have your buddies come early or late.    The food.  It was very underwhelming, my GF ordered the tacos, they were utterly devoid of flavor and very dry.  I got the turkey, ham and brie sandwich and upgraded to the loaded fries.  The sandwich was tasty other than the partially stale bread but it was tiiiiiiiny.  Not nearly enough for a grown man.  As for the loaded fries, well they take a normal, sizable portion of fries, cut it down to literally about 16 fries then cover them in a weird cheese sauce with some peppers, they were pretty tasty for the most part but it was hardly even a kids size portion.    Overall, we will not be going back.  The place is weird, the food less than mediocre and overpriced."}
{"text":"Just left Bar Louie a few minutes ago. Me and my girlfriend walked in and stood at the front door for 3 or 4 minutes with no greet and indication you should seat yourself. Finally got the bartenders attention so we sat at one of the high top bar tables. Two servers walked past and said nothing. After about 5 minutes we got up and left."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!!!!! Ordered chicken nachos and they came with no cheese or salsa and only had 4-5 pieces of chicken. The drinks were inconsistent and were not poured correctly... the manager did nothing to rectify the situation! And the icing on the cake........she brought silver literally 2 minutes before removing the empty plate!"}
{"text":"The Voodoo chicken is out of this world !! Great place friendly, clean and awesome service!!"}
{"text":"This Bar Louie is located on one of the trendy blocks in Cleveland. It was my first time at that location. We enjoyed hanging out and dining there. They have great space both indoors and out, and we were able to pick where we wanted to sit. My favorite thing here is the salmon sliders. I tried them on a whim once in Charlotte, but they are now my go to. Everyone I was with really enjoyed their food as well...great place to chill on a nice summer weekend evening."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday evening for a drink before a concert. There was also a Pirates game and this place was DEAD. Still, there was no host/hostess, tables were full of uneaten food and nothing was bussed or cleaned. We sat ourselves and a server finally showed up. While the server was fine, the drinks we ordered took forever and there were only two other tables with patrons. We ordered nachos and calamari, both which came quickly but were literally disgusting. The calamari was extremely burnt and the nachos were cold and covered in the most disgusting excuse for guacamole I'd ever seen. I did not have any expectations for a place like this on the \"North Shore\" and luckily Bar Louie proved right. Never. Again."}
{"text":"Slowww service,  this place is dead, what is the hold up. My Margarita is the worst more I've had in a very long time. I had to check on the waitress to even order an appetizer.  Overpriced drinks overpriced food sub par service."}
{"text":"Food was 7 out of 10 for this type of bar / restaurant. Service was extremely poor and bar service was also extremely poor. Untrained and understaffed bartenders will keep me from coming back. No reason to not be able to get a drink when sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"it would have been great if Zac had put in our food order, but he didn't. And then the kitchen closed."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the place I wanted to go was closed, so this was plan B.  I ordered \"the dirty\" martini. Now let me tell you that a dirty martini is my drink of choice, so I do know exactly how it should be. This one was absolutely disgusting. All I tasted was olive brine. I did not taste any alcohol at all. The 3 blue cheese stuffed olives were gross. I did not taste any tang from the blue cheese whatsoever and the olives had the most off putting texture. I would have sent it back, had I seen my bartender again. She seemed to disappear for 20 minutes.   What a waste of 10 dollars. I would have rather lite 10 bucks on fire.   I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Went before an event last night with a group of friends. Food is ok. They have an event menu so you don't many choices. Do not get the hummus platter not good. Tried the Mac n cheese w chicken it was ok as well. Service was average. Think the waiter was a little flustered by a large table. Had a hard time keeping up with all the drinks. The beer glasses sat empty quite a while. This was our first time will probably give it another try during a happy hour when prices are alittle less."}
{"text":"We sat down and waited for over 20 minutes for a server to notice us. Took another 10 minutes to get drinks. There were only a handful of other guests there so you'd think they wouldn't take long. The plates and silverware had marks and stains all over them. Its a shame, Bar Louie has amazing food, poor service."}
{"text":"We went to this place last night and I was not happy with our visit. With the exception of the guy  playing guitar and the bartender this place certainly deserves the neg reviews on here. For starters this place was not busy AT ALL yet  when we sat down we were never greeted or even acknowledged. And when they did look at us it was obvious they didn't want us in there at least that's how I felt. No smiles, \"hey how are you\" or anything. So after 20 minutes or so we gave up on the tables and went right to the bar. We ordered the nachos which were dry. I don't think the cooks really take passion in their work at least that's what the nachos showed. Not to mention that the girl who brought us our food couldn't even ask us if we needed anything else or even look at us for that matter. She turned around and walked away while I was asking for more napkins. The music wasn't that loud so I know she heard me. After we got our food and drinks we didn't get any other attention after that. There are plenty of bars at Westgate do yourself a favor and skip this one. Every other bar we went to the people greeted us, served us with a smile and were more than happy to take our money.  September 2017 Update: I haven't been on yelp for a while but I just seen this review from myself at the end of 2016 and I remember that night. By the most recent reviews I see nothing has changed. Bar Louie! You need to train your staff better. You need to hold people accountable and heads need to roll for their lack of customer service because this bar obviously doesn't have it. I don't know how you people stay in business. Don't say that that's not what your company is about. Bad customer service is what your company is about considering you've done nothing to change it."}
{"text":"This place is nice inside but the bartender was a jerk. I think he was drinking. I questioned my food being sat on the table unattended while I was in the restroom, he said I shouldn't have left my seat. Then he picked up my plate of food and threw it in the trash, instead of offering me another plate. He was an ass. Will NEVER GIVE THEM A CENT OF $... telling everyone I know not to go"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times now and I've had varied experiences. What I will say is that I am always satisfied with the food, I've never had a complaint there. Happy hour specials are very good as well. And of course, the view is great.   However, the service has been questionable at best, at least in my experiences. Now I don't totally blame that on the servers themselves, I've been there enough times that I am starting to feel like the management is very poor.   My first time there we went down for a happy hour. Our waiter served us quickly, we got our drinks and then we were given our bill. Never asked if we wanted more drinks or food, just gave us our bill and seemed annoyed with us that we wanted more drinks. And mind you, it was not very busy. I always try to give the benefit of the doubt depending on the circumstance, this however, was not the case.   Another visit was a much better one, our waitress was great considering how busy it was. But what I did notice is that she seemed to be the only one working hard. Others were loafing around and not being attentive to others. There were multiple occasions where people sat for quite some time with empty drinks/plates before being served. Our waitress certainly deserved to make the most in tips that night.  The most recent visit was odd. Our waiter looked like he had no experience with waiting on tables. I certainly do not blame him for that. I honestly believe the management set him up for failure instantly. He did his best and was at least attentive to us. He had asked for help from a nearby waitress in getting us a round of beers, the waitress gave them to the wrong table, which is not a big deal and we politely said that those were ours, she looked at us, never said a word and just walked away. Are you kidding me? Never even brought us our beers and we had to ask our waiter to get us new beers. It just seems that there are no consequences for how some of the servers act. I can imagine that the turnover rate is pretty high. I feel like it's a place that I wouldn't want to work for. And for that, I blame management."}
{"text":"Such a bad experience- they need to learn customer service.  We had a great meal my boyfriend and I just apps and drinks.  My future mother in law came to town and we decided to take her here... Awful!  I called  to let them know since we live across the street, weren't looking for anything free.  None of the drinks we wanted all out, no ice at a bar mind you the salads were awful!  Called and they promised free meals,  called today and spoke to crystal, now they apparently can't honor their promise since it's new mgmt...not cool, we will never go back... The worst customer service ever!"}
{"text":"I think this is a great place to grab a late night bite...before or after drinking..i come here at least once a week..the place is clean..the staffs are friendly and it is open till 2 am....yes the bar and the kitchen!!! I love all their appetizers it is so delicious ....such as the pretzles....popcorn....trio dip & chips,..and many more...I am also a big fan of their sandwiches.....their BLTT is delicious ...and so is the grilled chicken avacado...i love this place...!!!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, prompt, and attentive.  My two star rating is for the wedge salad I ate which was too watery. Its like they washed the salad, but forgot to dry it.  I also ate the buffalo wings which was on the dry side.  I guess you come for the beer selection on tap and drink specials, not the food."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service. I waited 40 mins for a salad with grilled salmon. When the order finally arrived (they had lost my ticket), the salmon was full of oil, when I had specifically asked for grilled salmon.  I travel to Charlotte e/2 weeks- this is my last time in this horrible place. I discourage anyone who cares for service to go to this place to eat."}
{"text":"Went yesterday, I know it was 4th of July, and more people than a usual crowd. But... We walked in and good luck to find a table yourself. Nobody to direct you. We found a table and we wait wait wait wait wait. The table had all the dirty dishes and glasses from the previous customer. We sat down and the waitress came. We got some drinks and order an appetizer. One hour and a half later... the dirty dishes still on our table and no food. The waitress came again and said that it would take 20 minutes... One hour and 50 minutes for an appetizer. And then, the waitress came again and apologize and said the she couldn't tell about the time the food was going to be ready. And the table still not clean. Sorry Bar Louie, you are in a location that attracts a lot of people and the management probably knows that too. Never going back again and never refer to anyone."}
{"text":"Disappointing.....sloppy drinks, can't handle big crowds - definitely a place to avoid during busy times"}
{"text":"My place of zen with a lot of friendly faces and my favorite bartenders; Kristina, Kailee, Jessica, Makenzie, Dallas, & Scott."}
{"text":"The food was good when it could be/has been great. Service was the same or worse. A 15% tip seemed over generous, even though I'll readily tip 25%. Clueless server lost $10 tip on our table, and we are looking for a better fun place for drinks and a bite. Too bad. Had potential...bad hires, boss.  Who is the idiot guy bringing food plates? He's like \"Here's your food. I don't care, you're not my table.\""}
{"text":"Slow service at the bar.  Ordered a bourbon on the rocks.  It was $8.75.  Had 1 nextdoor at Holunian's that was twice as big for $6.00."}
{"text":"Don't let it's location in crocker park fool you.  I went to bar louie on half off martini night, so most of the martinis were only $5.  However, the bartenders purposely skimp on the alcohol so you order more to raise your tab, which means a better tip for them.  I went through 5 martinis that night and they were poorly made.  I should be receiving the same quality of a drink on half off martini night.  Needless to say those bartenders need to relearn/retrain.  terrible terrible terrible"}
{"text":"Place is always packed and it's hard to get into. They have a huge selection of drinks, beer, etc. Their wings (boneless) were great, their pretzels and calamari are awesome. Service depends on who you get and time of day. Friday night: be prepared to wait and it's a seat yourself kind of place."}
{"text":"Yummy drinks and food. Waitress was dreadful. I'm a waitress and I never complain but she was rolling her eyes at us and making mean faces. She gave my friend an attitude because they didn't have gluten free chips. Also she was wearing booty shorts and her tattoo on her arm and face piercing was showing. Not professional at all!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.   I had the BBQ burger and it was pretty good.  Not the best burger in the world but I thought it was better than most chains.   The best thing was the beer.  It was so cold it had pieces of ice floating in the glass.  That is how beer should be served.     My wife had a burger as well but she substituted the beef patty for a Portabella mushroom.  She said it was amazing.   Only thing is that you have to pay more for the option.  Why would a mushroom cost more than a beef patty?  Oh well!    The service was excellent.  I can't recall his name but the guy was on top of things.  Very friendly and kept checking on us to see if we needed anything else.      Overall nice place.  We will definitely come back.  Seems like ordering different appetizer's and drinks will be a better idea for our next visit."}
{"text":"Went late night after concert, no one came to table for 20 mins, took 25 for 2 bottles of beer. Food came out freezing and not all together. Server was very rude. Bathroom was so gross no working toilets, paper all over the place. And the soap dispenser was filled with water and fell right off the wall when I tried to use it. We were there for almost 2 hours and we couldn't wait to get out, I can say the WORST experience in a restaurant I've ever had."}
{"text":"The food looked good from where I was standing... but unfortunately, I was unable to actually taste it.  I walked in there with my friends last night expecting to get a decent burger.  When we waked in, we stood at the front of the restaurant for over 15 minutes waiting to be seated.  It seemed as though workers were walking by us trying not to make eye contact so they wouldn't have to take the time to seat us. Needless to say, we walked in unnoticed and walked out unnoticed."}
{"text":"Corita was a great help and made some fantastic drinks and was a pleasure to talk to. We chatted about tribal tattoos and decided we both hate them. Peace .. oh and she gave my friend heart burn. But that okay cuz I'm fine.."}
{"text":"Waited at the bar for over 20 minutes (counted the time after being there for about 10 minutes). We were never acknowledged let alone served. Wish I could give them zero stars. Wont be back."}
{"text":"It is 9:29 I ordered my burger at 8:15. I still don't have mine. Do I really need to say anymore?"}
{"text":"A nice corner bar with inside and outside seating. Servers were prompt and polite, food was good and drinks were delivered within reason. Average prices for big city bar."}
{"text":"I came to bar Louie for my best friends birthday because she had to have their strawberry jalape√±o martini. Normally, we come to see Alexa (who is absolutely amazing at her drink making abilities and always VERY friendly). However, she was unfortunately not working this particular night. When we sat at the bar we IMMEDIATELY got an unwelcoming  response from this VERY rude bartender Kelsey who rolled her eyes and bad mouthed us to OTHER BAR GUESTS for ordering a drink not on the menu. Very unprofessional. Every time we asked for something, like for example a menu, or simply another drink.. She would throw our request in our face. Worst experience. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Gave bar louie  a tried this past veteran day weekend because the que  for the surrounding  restaurants were long.  Worst mistake ever! It was self seating so we scanned for a table that were most visible.  Waited there for 20 min while the staffs walked pass our tables a dozen times.  We managed to make eye contact with a few of them,  however they acted as if we were wearing the cloak of invisibility.  We ended up walking out at the end without trying their food.  I'm surprise that place is still open."}
{"text":"Bar Louie has always been a much better alternative than the typical chain options that cover the suburbs of Cleveland.  Always have had a decent experience.  However, the latest visit was the last.  Let's start with the $7.25 Xmas Ale in a snifter....you've got to be kidding me!   $50 for a few beers and two appetizers.  But the biggest (and most disgusting) part of the experience was witnessing a bartender sample a customers drink twice with the same straw.  Gross!!!!"}
{"text":"Recently called in a to-go order at Bar Louie for a chicken Caesar salad which rang up for $13.xx. I was surprised by the high price but thought I may be in for the best Caesar salad ever. I retrieved my order from the bar which was easy as pie because the restaurant and bar were not busy at all. The server at the bar was kind. Upon opening the salad there was NO chicken. Called and spoke to the rudest General manager ever named chad. Chad claimed there was \"chicken all up in it\" as he had packed it up himself and that possibly \" it fell out on my trip back to work\". At this point I realized the I unprofessionalism associated with this manager and saw no point in continuing a call with such a immature rude individual.  A customer should generally always be right in this industry and I was made out to feel as though I was wrong. Will never recommend or return to Bar Louie."}
{"text":"If there is a ZERO star, I will do so.  This has been the worst place I have ever been in a long time.  I ordered a mango mojito, and got some berry drink instead. When I asked my server about it, the response i got was \"Oh, I thought that's what you ordered\" and \"I will bring you mango mojito next time.\"  Both my friend's salad and my entree had to be send back. (Which she never do and I rarely do.) She ordered a blackberry brie salad. She got pecan cranberry instead. We were told the manager made her second salad, which is 1/2 the size, with 4 blackberry, 4 tiny see through slices of brie, still has the pecan for the unknown reason, and few lettuce.   When I got my med-rare ahi tuna entree, my friend thought I have gotten salmon because it's not the healthy redish tuna color but the whiteish pink color. It was way over cooked! When I address this to our waiter, he just looked at it and say \"yeah, that's way over cooked\" and walked away. It's not till minutes later he asked if I would like them to remake the tuna. The second tuna I got was not any better. It tasted like they put 5 times the seasoning for the whole plate on the little fishes that they serve. It was way over salted and almost tasted gross.   And funny thing was, it was then I really came to appreciate how tart my berry drink is. It took that saltiness off the tuna.   Anyway, with the price of the menu, we were really hoping for a better experience. We didn't get that. We got surprises and questions about how a restaurant  can screw up so much for one table. Mind you, there were maybe only three tables when we first got there on a Saturday night. (And the only table left when we got our food.) We both agree this place don't have a very good chance. But even if it does, I WILL NEVER RETURN!!!!"}
{"text":"Time for a change...or rather getting some change !  I've pretty much written this place off as a result of my most recent visit.   A previous visit was tainted by dirty silverware but I decided to give this place one more chance to see if the condition was corrected. This time the silverware was reasonably clean and the food was good. Service was pretty good as well until....we paid our checks.  My attorney buddy paid with cash. When the change was returned it was 55 cents short. When asked about the shortage , our waiter responded that they couldn't make change with coins.  Really ? So the change is just kept by the restaurant?   They are penalizing someone for paying cash now ? His explanation was so absurd that it was laughable. It certainly wasn't the money but it is the principal of it.  This place really needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"Marissa is the best. Honestly, don't think I've ever met a better bar Louie representative.  1st round draft pick."}
{"text":"Super busy during game day, but staff was accommodating and fun, especially Marissa.  She did a great job with our drinks and getting our food out.  Happy with our choice."}
{"text":"What a delightful experience for this chain establishment.  We were in search of a place to dine outside on this perfect summer Friday evening. The sign said seat yourself and on 1st pass the only tables available were hightops built more fir standing with your adult beverages. This wasn't on this gals preferred list. We attempted the joint next door but waiting 90 min was an even I don't think so.... Back at  Bar Louie we went and scored a recently vacated table.  Maria our awesome waitress greeted us kindly but have us some bad news... They were training new kitchen staff and it was taking a bit longer than usual for orders to come out.. But she assured us once they did they were as yummy and up to Bar Louie standards people have come to expect.  Okay... Kudos, for letting us know in advance.  We ordered drinks and the food came out quicker than expected.  I ordered the  Chop Chop salad and added shrimp to mine... Was done perfectly and the slice of garlic toast was a welcome addition.  My husband  opted for the savory Mac n cheese pork sandwich....my taste bite was scrumptious and lived up to maria's hype.  Great food... Superb service... Great to see a chat in restaurant can still offer patrons something to come back for!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was such great service and the happy hr list was perfect !! Our server persilla (sp) was super nice a friendly!! Just a heads up, you just walk in and find your seats was little confusing at first but they greeted us and informed open seating :)"}
{"text":"1st time here, service was pretty shitty! I had one beer & appetizer, time to go! Not feeling it- staff is not attentive & personable, this time of year people want to spend money!! I bet I can find a better place to feel appreciated as a customer"}
{"text":"I enjoy going on Tuesday's for dollar burger night.  I also like to go during happy hour.  I think the food is over priced so I'd rather go during those times.  I love the smores martini.  The service is OK and depends on the day and time you go."}
{"text":"For a bar the food is generally very good. They also serve food until about 2:00 am which is really nice if you live downtown. Their shrimp po boy, tuna steak sandwich, fried chicken sandwich, and pulled pork sandwich are all great!  Most of their appetizers are good too with the exception of their dips which are terrible. It is a perfect place to eat outside in the summer also. It is very inconstant though and I don't recommend ordering take out as they tend to mess up the orders. Also, most of their sandwiches are fried or have sauce on them so they get very soggy. It is also difficult to be in there on a weekend night because they bring in a DJ who plays the music way too loud. Overall it is pretty good for the price and convenience."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Bar Louie in town square for dinner before a movie. We had been there once before with friends and my husband loved his treetini so we decided to go back. We sat on the outside patio, which was nice because it was great weather (for Vegas). Our server Nicole was great!! She gave us lots of suggestions off the menu, her service was fast, she checked up often and was super friendly. From the time we were there the hostess sat her two other tables that she had waited on before and she remembered them and their drink orders from before! My husband and I have both been servers before so we know what good service is and Nicole provided GREAT service. The food was very good also, especially for the price. We got an appetizer and two entrees and walked out paying about $30. We had the chicken nachos which are huge and so very yummy and my husband loved his grilled veggie wrap (that Nicole suggested) it's made with hummus and peppers and avocado, the hummus was great because it kept it from being dry. I had a Chicken Caesar, I could only eat about 1/2, it's pretty big and the chkn was very good, I usually don't like white meat chicken because it can be dry but this was perfect.  It also has a great atmosphere, great music and cool people, all just there to have fun. We also told the manager how great Nicole was and he was really nice too; he even gave us some coupons for a discount when we come back. We also noticed he was walking around throughout the night helping to serve tables and talk to people, not just sitting in the back. This place was great I'd highly recommend it to any one just looking to enjoy some good drinks, great food and a fun time.   WE WILL DEFINATELY BE BACK :)"}
{"text":"Terrible service! My friend had an issue with his temporary Id because they wouldn't take it even though he had all of the paper work and is 22! We called them prior to our visit asking if it would be okay and they said yes. The manager told my friend to \"calm down\" after he tried to explain that to her. Very rude staff... And it was on St. Paddy's Day! Who does that! And it's very hot in here."}
{"text":"I wanna love Bar Louie, I do. It seems like even on the deadest of nights it takes 20 minutes or more for a waitress to even show up at our table and get a drink order from us. The food is good, but the past 3 or 4 times I've come they've been out of tater tots by 9 PM, and I'm always told after my order is put in and the kitchen decides it's now time to tell the wait staff they're out of something. It may be time to start frequenting a different location besides the one on the Waterfront."}
{"text":"Well it's 9pm on a Tuesday and no tater tots. Dip for the chips are cold and beer is room temperature. Not very happy. Will try the station square bar Louie next time."}
{"text":"Nice place. Great Chicken nachos.....the best I've had eating out!"}
{"text":"Update!! Was messaged on YELP to message the manager via Facebook to address the below complaint. Messaged her two days after this review. Guess what, no response. Looking at their page, they just went down and found the reviews for that day, messaged everyone who left a bad review to make Bar Louie look responsive, then moved the bad reviews to below better reviews. They were just bad before, now they appear manipulative, if not actively managing their business in bad faith.    Atrocious. Horrible. Bleedingly slow. Excuses. Manager and four servers incompetent. Ass hanging out of the servers shorts...appetizer? No, disgusting and sloppy. All open seating. But no server support. We had to track down a server, who basically said \"huh? Is this my section.\" (*adjust shorts\") manager came over, basically did his version of a Scooby Doo impression, and said, welp, it's busy, I have two hour ticket times, it is what it is. What a joke. Other locations are on point. This was total a joke. Here was the timeline, sat, 15 min no server, at 20 min went to get our own drinks at the bar, at 30 min ordered appetizers and drinks, at 45 minutes (without receiving our server drinks) we got out second round from the bar, at an hour, we started wondering where the eff our server was (who we found tending to her ONE other table...(she's ambitious)), at 1:15 (still no food) start freaking the eff out, 1:30 in, complain to server and says, tee hee *adjust shorts, I'll tell the manager, 1;45 food arrives. 2:00, manager LEAVES THE BUILDING! Server says here is ur bill and we leave. Eff this places go to yard house."}
{"text":"The service has been incredibly slow every time I've been, but since I only go on Tuesday nights for their happy hour martinis (get the Effin' Good!) and $5 burgers, it's understandable. Great deal and cool atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Food and service was great! Like the selection of drinks on the happy hour menu. Prices were a bit too high to go any other time than happy hour."}
{"text":"The place is large and spacious with a large bar.  The service was okay but it was the middle of the afternoon and there were not many people in the place.  The draft beer selection was most large commercial brews and were between 5-7 dollars. With a limited number of spots in the immediate area it is a fine place to have a drink."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch yesterday and Amanda was great.  Her service was top notch and she recommended great meals."}
{"text":"Disappointing! My salad was supposed to have avocado and garbanzo beans but had neither. My companion ordered a medium rare burger but it came medium well. When you order a gin martini you SHOULD be able to taste the gin. It's kind of the point. Instead I got a lecture about how you're never supposed to be able to taste the alcohol in cocktails. All in all, a very bad experience. Avoid!"}
{"text":"We had a large group(60 people) of athletes, parents and coaches and needed a place to have dinner on Valentines Day after a swim meet at CSU. After calling several places with no luck I called Bar Louie in the Warehouse District and spoke with Jonah, one of the managers. He was able to place all of us in a private back room, seat all of the athletes together and then have the servers take orders and match up athlete to family on separate checks. I couldn't have been happier but then the serving staff outdid themselves. Thank you all for accommodating us and for the great food and service. We will be back next year!!!!"}
{"text":"I was eating some barbeque boneless wings and half way through the plate I came across what I thought was a bone. I reached into my mouth and pulled out a 1 inch long piece of metal wire. I brought this up to my waitress and she brought out the manager. It turns out that a piece of the deep fryer basket had broken off and became lodged into one of the wings.   They ended up paying for my drinks and a different appetizer, but at that point I wasn't even hungry. I would say that they got off easy, because swallowing a metal wire could have killed me.   Fair warning to anyone who eats here: Be aware of what you are eating."}
{"text":"This was the worst dining experience we have ever had.  Something is serious broke with the operation at this place.  Not only did our table wait for 2 hours to get food,90% of it never showed up.  We witnessed other tables walk out and not get food after long waits!  The table next to ours with about 10 folks had same issue but they were there even longer!     I will be contacting this place to speak with the owners.    I will also. E reaching out to the corporate operation to express how bad this was.    Further I witnessed a employee in the rest room not wash upon exiting!  Rest rooms were a mess.  The walls I looked at have not been cleaned in a long time.    Very very disturbing experience."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. The food, when it's timely and correct, is pretty great. Good drinks too. But on more than one occasion, the service has been terrible. We actually had a serve get fired in the middle of serving us! Recommend that you sit at the bar and order drinks. It you're determined to eat, make sure it's not when they are crowded!  **Update** I can't make this up. Went to Bar Louie for brunch on 9/10. The cook messed up our order of omelettes TWICE!!!! And the coffee was cold. I am done with this location."}
{"text":"Worse margarita ever.  Jet fuel would have tasted better.  Waitress could have cared less when brought to her attention."}
{"text":"Went there tonight, was served raw chicken and told our server. She did comp our $13 bill but no manager even came over to apologize or look at the dish. Basically, never ordering chicken from there again. Be careful!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Bar Louie out with my wife after a  movie on a Sunday night.  I must say it was a great experience.  We were welcomed right away from the moment entering the door.  The bartender introduced herself and the other bartender by name.  We were provided great service and recommendations on drinks.  I asked to speak to the manager to share my thoughts. She was very humble and gave all the credit to her staff.  I'm definitely coming back and recommend Bar Louie for future company outings."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE FOOD!!! Deserves a ZERO rating! At first glance this appears to be a nice bar but the food was terrible!  I ordered the Philly burger and it came out topped with burnt mushrooms. I took the burnt mushrooms off and took a bite of the burger and it had ZERO flavor and tasted like it just came out the freezer YUCK!!!! I had the server take it away and I was too disgusted to try anything else. They need to invest in better food and cooks instead of spending money on a band.  WILL NOT RETURN!!!"}
{"text":"I will be back for the strawberry lemonade sangria, it is a 5 star!!  The food was a 3.5 star.   Our waitress was a 2 star."}
{"text":"A friend and I frequent Bar Louie for happy hour during the week a few times a month, we recently started going to the station square location, the one at the water front is always insanely crowed, and the service there sucks..that being said we have never had a bad bar tender at the new location, and the 1/2 ap menu is defiantly worth the paid parking. the bruchetta and shrimp tempura are amazing, as well as the $5 martini menu."}
{"text":"I'd give it more like a 3.5. There's a few pros and cons about this place.   No greeter, you just kind of walk in and sit wherever and if the servers aren't paying attention then you have to flag them down.   Great drink specials during the week. Other than that their drinks are average priced and decent depending on what you order.   Vibe is nice, chill spot if you was decent food and drinks at a decent price. Live music on Fridays, which is cool.   I've gotten salmon sliders, they're ok. Burgers are ok. Loaded Tater tots are pretty good.  The Asian shrimp lettuce wrap is GREAT! Best thing I've had so far."}
{"text":"We stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie. Our server, was friendly. My husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me. Both drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol.  After I finished my drink, I used my fork to dig for the blackberries at the bottom only to find (to my disgust), a decent sized piece of clear saran wrap! Ugg! Did they muddle the mint into the saran wrap?!!! She comped the drink but we won't be back. Can't speak about the food since we didn't have any but atmosphere was loud and it was difficult to have a conversation without repeating yourself."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Took over a half hour to get a drink. Couldn't get the order right. Don't come here!"}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed in this place!! One, there is this event menu that lacks all the food available. Second I ordered the chicken nachos and spinach/artichoke dip, both cold!!! The chicken was not only cold yet deceivingly warm on the outside and freezing in the center. I can say honestly though the cucumber martini I had was delicious!!! The manager did try to accommodate me but after having to send back the spinach/artichoke dip then having the chicken literally ice cold all I wanted was the check and the nearest exit!!"}
{"text":"Not the best Bar Louie I've visited.  Its walking distance from the Hilton.  The food was good, but I ordered a house salad with my meal, and they brought it all out at once.  The bar was busy,  but the bartender was keeping up.   I'll chalk it up to the kitchen and serving staff having issues,  but overall not good enough to go back."}
{"text":"Bad customer service in the entire Pittsburgh! The staff completely ignored us. We waited for 15 minutes but no one came to take our orders (even after I waved at them). Finally, we left the restaurant because it got very frustrating. I will never visit this location of Bar Louie.,"}
{"text":"Food is good but service is ok. I like their Crispy Calamari and their Fried Luis Burger. They need to train their servers a little bit more."}
{"text":"Although I haven't been there in a couple weeks, I always went there on Tuesday's for their $5 burger deal. They have some nice waitresses and a outdoor area where most smokers eat and/or relax. I'll be going back again soon."}
{"text":"I met a friend of mine at Westgate and was going to get a waffle. We saw Bar Louie and I told them that I had been to the one in Tempe. We decided to go in try it. As we talked to our server Jasmine she explained to us that they had just opened two days ago. I would have never know that by how knowledgeable and friendly the staff were. Jasmine made recommendations and was very attentive to us. I had the salmon sliders and was happy with my meal! Definitely a place I would visit again soon."}
{"text":"Well. Besides waiting for 50 min to be served our cold appetizers followed by our entr√©es that were missing most of the pieces and parts, and then realizing we were CHARGED for \"extra\" pieces and parts after asking to supply aforementioned MISSING pieces and parts I'd say it was an all around super s#!t experience. Make sure to paddle your douche canoe directly to the back booth and enjoy being totally ignored and thirsty! 11/10 will definitely never be back."}
{"text":"I think the food here is okay. I love their salsa chip combo. I also like to order the chicken tacis,because you can assemble them yourself. Service can be a bit slow but you are in a college town. I mean I get who wants to have to work when you could be out partying with your friends but at least they try. I haven't had anything besides the tacos but they are worth trying"}
{"text":"I like Crocker Park and this looked like a great place for Happy Hour especially since they have 5.25 martini's and half priced appetizers. The appetizers weren't too bad. We got a basic cheese quesadilla, nothing special and the buffalo chicken flatbread, which was pretty decent tasting. However, the martini's tasted good but seemed totally watered down with very little alcohol. Since it turned 7 while we were there we got into the non happy hour prices and was astounded to see that a non HH mojito was like 10 dollars, with a very weak pour of alcohol. We sat at the bar so we had pretty decent service, maybe even a little too attentive."}
{"text":"Horrible service never going back. The hostess seated people before us and did not even apologize. Her response sorry you feel that way have a nice night. Than when we spoke with the manager chad her reseated us and said he would bring us out some food and than proceeded to put the food which we never ordered but he brought out on our tab. Never never going back."}
{"text":"I went this evening. The chop chop salad was awesome. The shrimp tempora was too bready. The bartenders were awful."}
{"text":"A few months ago I went to Bar Louie with my girlfriends. One of the waitresses spilled sauce on my favorite blue jacket. Despite her initial response which was-you got ranched- I found her to be extremely helpful. The management also did everything in their power to save my beloved jacket including offering to pay the laundry bill. For a joyous, carefree customer like myself, this place was a breath of fresh air."}
{"text":"Second time here, food was great, drinks were great and our server Rose did a great job."}
{"text":"Horrible, and I mean absolutely horrible service. Went there on a sunday night with a group of 7, and unlike other places that charge gratuity with 8 or more, Bar Louie charges it with 6 or more people. I ordered an appetizer to split with my gf, had 2 beers and she had 2 mixed drinks. Our total came out to over $50 after waiting 20 mins for the server to get our checks right. If you are on a budget and want to have a good time, this is not the place to go. Everything on the menu is highly overpriced. Will not be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"Bar Louie has Bell's Two Hearted Ale  on Tap; 3.25 a pint during happy hour. They also feature $1 burgers ( regular size , not sliders) on Tuesdays.  they attract a lot  of people, for whatever reason, location, ambience, , staff ,etc but it's a cool enough place to be"}
{"text":"Amanda from Flagstaff...was very attentive and made our first date with Rick rememberable.  Amanda was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Bar Louie, a nation chain recently took over the location previously held by Metro Bar + Grill in Cleveland's warehouse district. While the name has changed, plenty has stayed the same. Much of the furniture remains um changed, lighting fixtures remain, patio furniture is still here from the Metro days, the outside bar on the sidewalk still draws a walk up crowd and some of the interior decorating is still in place. In fact, aside from paining interior walls to a pea green color (or was it pea green all along with additional lighting showcasing it's beauty?) and a different name on the door the space still has the feel of the old tenant.  That's where the similarities end.  The first noticeable change is there is a crowd, something Metro would only see on a Friday or Saturday night. There is a new staff to serve the patrons and while there seem to be plenty on hand in this early phase, you wouldn't know it by their lack of attention. One patron even tried to switch bar seats in hopes of getting service. The kitchen appears to still be in the process of working the kinks out because orders were coming out to the dining area at a turtles pace. When my order did come out, it was sent back by the bartender who apparently has better quality control than the head chef.  The menu is larger than the Metro days, and should provide picky eaters a wide range of traditional options that may not be commonly available in the warehouse district. This seems to have appealed so far to a more mainstream crowd and less to the yuppie/socialite scene. Bar Louie had a good mix of after work drinkers, jeans and t-shirt goers and couples both young and old. Pretentious types were in low supply.  The early returns are favorable. I'm disappointed that the service at a national chain wasn't top notch right out of the gate. The larger, Americana style menu is a plus over it's predecessor and the low key environment makes all guests feel welcome. Time will only tell if the warehouse districts latest tenant will last past its 15 minutes of fame to become an anchor in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous afternoon here all thanks to our server Missy!! She was helpful, fun, and very attentive to our large group of 20+ people! Thank you Missy and Bar Louie on the North Shore for making our day wonderful!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give five stars but, their service isn't so great. The food (fish and chips) is really good and their Pineapple Express sangria is amazing, but their bartenders aren't very friendly. The few times I have been here, the tall guy is really nice and attentive, but if you get served by one of the ladies, they are pretty stand off ish. Guess they won't pay much attention to other women, but if your a dude, you will probably get some awesome service!"}
{"text":"I can't even review this place. We sat ourselves and waited for a waitress to take our order, and we waited and waited until we got tired and just left. And I have to be clear it was a Saturday afternoon, maybe like 10 tables with people at them and I saw 3 waitress walking around. I think it's probably a bad idea to ignore people that come into your restaurant, especially since burgatory just opened across the street."}
{"text":"This was not a great expedience. The happy hour specials are a little confusing be careful as there's not a lot of items on the happy hour list. I had the sliders and I was very disappointed it was all bread and little meat. It was also very plain with no flavor. Our service was terrible, our water was never filled the whole time we were there and it took forever to get our check. I will never spend another scent here as there are way to many choices at Tempe market Place."}
{"text":"The bar area was packed on a friday evening and I met a group of about 12 girls for a bday celebration.  The waitress was sooooo slow and never checked on us and messed up our drink order repeatedly.  We would have to actually go and look for her when we needed something.  We ordered about 7 apps for the table and although they were good, it did not make up for the lackluster service.  If your in for drinks and people watching then its ok but wouldn`t go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"Our waiter was nice and they had good beer on tap. However, we were starving...ordered food and waited for over an hour and a half. Finally we were told they lost our ticket! We weren't comped and drinks or anything and just had to leave hungry,,,,luckily there is a chipotle a few doors down!"}
{"text":"I have been here once before on a first date and because the date didn't go so well I never came back.  It wasn't the restaurant. .    I've been passing the place up recently as I've headed to the boardwalk over the past few months and decided to give it a try.  I was not disappointed.  The waiter was wonderful and had the bartender make me a concoction because while I like a little fruit I don't like overlay sweet or carbonated beverages.  My specially made strawberry mojito was perfect.  Then my meal was the jerk chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps.  Wow!  If you like spicy these will not disappoint.  You get to make them yourself so you can control the heat but the jerk flavor is delicious.  I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"It took quite some time to get our drinks even though the place was practically empty.  The drinks were pricey, and im not being hyperbolic when I say that bar louie served me the worst Margarita I've ever had.  Apatizer was ok, but the service was so slow and the drinks so overpriced I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, will not be back. I ordered a beer at the bar and 15 minutes later the bartender came back to see what we wanted to order food wise and realized she forgot to get my beer. I reminded her and also ordered an appetizer. She gave me my beer but then forgot to put our order in. Forty minutes later, she told us it was coming right out, 15 more minutes passed and my wife and I were ready to walk right when the food came out. Bartender gave us our food but didn't refill my wife's water or my beer which had been empty for at least 25 minutes. we placed the exact change down on the counter, minus tax, and walked out, we didn't even ask for our check. She can pick up the added tax as a reminder of the bartender's horrible service."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a day touring the city and was not entirely pleased. It was a Monday, late afternoon, and the women's restroom was disgusting. Toilet paper and paper towels everywhere as well as dirty sinks. Our appetizer and lunch plates were very sloppy, however tasted good. (I truly am not picky or complain often) We sat outdoors and did have a beautiful view of Pittsburgh. The ceiling and lighting outside was covered with dust and cobwebs and I doubt the windows are ever cleaned. Despite all of the negatives, our waitress was very polite and attentive which made the experience a little better."}
{"text":"The food was overpriced for what it was.  The fried chicken sandwich overwhelmed the bun it was on and the bun was mush after a few minutes.  Given that nothing we ordered was complicated, it took a long time to get the food.  We were told they didn't expect to be as busy as they were.  It didn't seem overwhelmed and there were plenty of open tables.  Of note, the circular booths have tables too large for people to comfortably get into or out of them.  They are also so high they hide you from the service staff.  Service was average.  It took too long to get drinks and refills were difficult to come by, but we could at least tell our server was spending his time between numerous tables.  I'll give the place another go again, to see if this experience was just a random \"off night.\""}
{"text":"Just like any other Bar Louie (I really need to stop going to franchise places), but the service was a little lacking. We got what we ordered and it was prepared correct, but our water and drinks were not promptly refilled. FWIW, middle of the road in terms of bar atmosphere, drink and food quality, and prices."}
{"text":"I have been at bar louies a few times.  Happy hour is hard to find a table.  Happy hour boneless chicken is the best, bbq / hot and I have lunch the next day.  Tues. they have a special $5.00 burgers with fries or tots. Gotta luv it. All wait staff is so friendly great happy hour or just a friendly drinking spot. Must go see for yourself!"}
{"text":"We went before an event at Gila River arena. It was really busy, but being at that location they should be prepared for it. They had a special event menu which I can understand in older to speed up service and getting food out. We were there for 2 hours, got out drinks promptly, but only got one of our three appetizers. We had to eat the one fast because we received it 20 minutes before the show started. End up cancelling the rest of our order. Should be better prepared, good concept, really bad execution."}
{"text":"First time venturing into this new spot after a movie. It was about 10pm and were lookin for a snack and some drinks. Was not packed as a normal spot is for a Saturday. Which was good. We walked in and there was not sign or anyone to tell you to go to hell or to sit where ya want. We just sat at the bar, no worries.   Mrs wanted to try a something from their drink list and the bartender was nice to point out some good choices. She had a tasty Le Fresca Margarita. I had my hopes up for a Blue Moon, but no dice. For some reason, half the taps were down. The 4peaks Heffe was good. We ordered the nachos and the pot stickers. Was OK food. Nothing special. Good presentation and was tasty.   The interior was Cheescake Factory meets Yard House meets a chain bar. It was ok. Low lights, made it comfortable. But you could tell that they were running on limited staff. There were unbussed tables around the place. The music was alternative and was t a good level at the bar. We were able to have a conversation with out yelling, but the as you walk the space, there are more loud spots throughout. The bar in the middle of the space makes it a great people watching place. Good mix of people, Not alot of ASU students, but not alot of families. The service was good because we were at the bar, but there was a few times that people from tables came to the bar to get someone to come over to their table. Bartenders had a certain bitchiness about them that is good for a night club, but will probably hurt them if a more professional crowd shows up.   Will be back. Just hope it will still be there! Reading the history of this place, it has tried 3 times to exist in the valley, but never makes it."}
{"text":"I have always had slow service here. The food is decent and the food has always come in a timely manner. The problem is getting someone to take your initial order or getting a refill of anything. I have tried sitting at the bar and it might have actually been worse. Cody, the bartender all three times, walks right by you."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at this place. Devin was such a great bartender. Very personable and great conversation.  She recommended the fish and chips. It was an amazing recommendation. We would definitely come back to Bar Louie. Thank you Devin for making our night."}
{"text":"CRAZY how good food can be ruined by bad service. Ghetto, would never recommend for in-dining to fellow flight crews staying in the area"}
{"text":"I went to Bar Louie last Friday after work for their happy hour. I think 1/2 price small plates (appetizers) and $4 wine & $5 martinis were great deals. I was meeting with my friend who has been unemployed for a few months now and I wanted to treat her...and their happy hour pricing would definitely help me treat her without going broke.   We had a couple of martinis, and wine. I had a hummus, tabbouleh, and tzatziki, and cheeseburger sliders (I couldn't decide whether to get this or Mini Kobe Hot Dog but my waiter recommended it). My friend had a shrimp quesadilla. Let me tell you, the food itself was good, I mean they were not great, but they were good. BUT, I had a huge issue that I ended up giving 2 stars.....  There was a bunch of fruits flies just flying over our food and drinks... ewww..... I know they are not harmful, just annoying. But they just grossed me out... Fruits flies in December? In Cleveland? I didn't know the fruits flies are okay with a cold weather."}
{"text":"Whatever you do don't ask who Louie is... They'll deny you service..., so ridiculous!!!!! All day looking forward to come to this place and this happens."}
{"text":"Went there tonight to meet a friend for drinks and food. It felt like the bartender didn't want anything to do with us after placing our order. I'm a server so I know when someone is busy. She was not busy. She just avoided us the entire time. I only have two stars because my cheese fries were pretty good."}
{"text":"So dissatisfied tonight. Came in for $5.00 burger night and waited for 15 mins to see if we're going to get served. Then my boyfriend had to call a waitress to get our drinks,  we didnt want to wait longer so we order right away. Then we had to wait another 20 mins for our food after the waitress said it was on its way.  The waitress was not attentive she forgot our refills and I was just done I know that they are busy but still you should check your tables once an a while."}
{"text":"Would have gone with one star if the waitress hadn't been so nice. Just picked up a to go burger and fries. Burger is so so and fries are cold. All for $12 ... not worth it!"}
{"text":"Went her for our one night in Pittsburgh. We ordered the chicken nachos for an appetizer, the were good, but majority of the chips had nothing on them. I got the pig and pepper sliders for dinner, although they were good, they didn't come with half the stuff the menu said it did. Our server was really nice though and gave us some great insight on what to get."}
{"text":"Food is decent and a good price at happy hour. However the wait staff is unfriendly and deceitful. Our friends had to leave early, so they paid their bill separate and left. As a nice gesture, they paid for my burger and a drink. The waitress then proceeded to charge me for the burger and drink as  well. She thought that I wouldn't know and she challenged me on it. Seriously?"}
{"text":"Randomly found this place, and was very pleasantly surprised.  The interior is spacious and roomy, with lots of space between tables.  Kind of an airy, industrial feel, I guess.   Also, the staff was very friendly.    I had a beer and one of their \"signature\" martinis--which was very strong and well-made.  My portabella mushroom burger was also delicious.  Finally, I should mention that the happy hour here is a ridiculous deal. In fact, I thought they made a mistake on the bill when we got it, no joke. My share of the bill, which included the aforementioned beer, fancy martini, mushroom burger, and part of an appetizer was like 8 or 9 dollars. Seriously. Granted, it was dollar burger night, but still..."}
{"text":"We went here Friday night and was able to get right in compared to other restaurants in the area where the was at least a 30 min wait. Bar was nice when went in. But the service and food was horrible. 4 of us ordered different things and was totally surprised when None of us didn't enjoy it. Service was really slow. This is just my opinion. So enter at your own risk. Overall bad experience and will never go back."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of Bar Louie. The food isn't that great, but I do come here from time to time. It's one of those places everyone knows so you just end up suggesting that you meet there for drinks. I do usually have fun when I'm here even though there are other bars that I would rather support. They have a drink selection you would expect. Overall, it's a fine place to go but not my first choice. Nothing special really."}
{"text":"Um awful. Had chicken tortilla soup. It came out half way cold. The soup looked like someone mixed a can of diced tomatoes in chicken broth and squeezed some limes in. Tater tots was ok (soggier than I'd like).   Prob won't come back."}
{"text":"We brought a party of around 25 here last week. We reserved the downstairs party room that I *believe* was suppose to hold  up to 45. My only criticism of the entire night was that the room was a bit on the small side and we very much filled the room with our 25. If you are bringing a party of more than 25, I would request to see their other rooms before booking.   The service was phenomenal. No one was without a drink in their hand and the servers paid close attention to the amount of drink left in our glasses. They quickly offered to refill them (of course, this also helps the restaurant drive up the bill, but I'm not complaining).   The food was pretty good. We ordered a smorgasbord of different appetizers. Comparatively, I've had better Apps at Hodges, but the food still met the mark.   I'm giving this experience 4 stars mostly due to the service and the interaction I had with the restaurant manager prior to the night. He was very attentive and responded quickly.   I would book another event here again, although I will definitely physically go to the restaurant beforehand and look at the space to see if it *actually* would fit our group."}
{"text":"Bar Louie is where it's at on Tuesdays.  The good:  $5 burger night can't be beat. The burgers are good. Their ranch is probably some of the best I've ever had. No wait self seating.   The bad:  The patio needs some work. The misters need some cleaning for hard water buildup and maybe some repairs. The outdoor couches seem to be constantly drenched because of the clogged up misters that drip instead of mist. Some of the wait staff are not top notch."}
{"text":"So, Let Me first say this I tried all The Martinis they have including the ones they took off the menu and the new ones they added last week And I'm a fan of them all excluding the ones with chocolate just because I'm not a chocolate fan but I still tried them just to say I did LOL. As far as the food I tried the Meatballs they were Ok nothing amazing but ok. I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that the 3 times I went there to eat,the food was delicious,BUT 2 of those 3 times the food took longer than a hour to come out...the service is horrible, I can understand maybe that they are backed up in the kitchen but the waitress barely checked on us. I had to go to the bar to get a water because the waitress kept \"forgetting to bring it\". I got my food before I got a WATER, and my food took about a hour and a half to get. If this place wants to stay open then they need to get more servers and more cooks."}
{"text":"Totally not worth it. Gave it a second try & some, but not all of the food is good. My blue louie burger was pretty good, except the actual burger itself had no flavor. My boyfriends Po Boy fish sandwich was inedible-they really need to get better fish! The service is subpar, slow & noone looks like they know what's going on. The table behind us had a bloody mary swelling in the sun for about an hour (or more) before it got bused. Not worth thr price or the risk of crap service or food. Never again."}
{"text":"Special, Special, Read all about it!  I have to say that this is a great place for a good meal and great drink. I think the specials are what have drawn me in.  First think you need to know is that this is a chain establishment so you have to expect the typical problems that would come from any other chain.  The happy hour (4-7pm; M-F) is amazing. They have special for every kind of drinker with beer, wine, and martini specials. The $5 martini's are excellent and not your average martini. The staff works hard to make sure your drink is made just right. They use fresh ingredients to make for a very tasty drink. They also have some great 1/2 price appetizers and flat breads. The food quality has been great every time that I've been in to eat.  If you don't go for happy hour, the prices might scare you away. They have a couple other specials that I've visited for on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. On Tuesdays they have $5 for specialty burgers and fries later in the day up until closing. I'm not actually sure what time it starts. On Wednesdays, they feature $1 domestic drafts ALL DAY!  The bar staff is always attentive when I visit, and I've never experienced any problems from them. I did have trouble on one visit, when it literally took me forever to get my drink. I ordered a drink and appetizer at the same time and received my appetizer before I got my drink. In total, it took about a good 10 minutes for the appetizer and another 5 minutes for my drink to arrive. I have no idea why it should take 15 minutes to get a drink. Since then, I have never sat anywhere but the bar even when I am with my friends, we try to sit closer to the action.  I highly recommend this place as it does have good quality food and service for the most part."}
{"text":"I don't want to even rate this place to be honest. Walked in with a few friends... no one to greet or seat us.. seated ourselves... while 2-3 waiters saw us and walked by .. even holding a conversation in front of us.. but never came to our table... waited 10 mins and left."}
{"text":"Nachos we're good. Service was a bummer. Never came back to take a lunch order for my Son and I. Also....servers need to run a brush through their hair. They all look hungover and gnarly."}
{"text":"They took forever get us our order the lettuce wrap  Food was cold  Waitness was slow and not interested in working. I would never come back to eat here again. Got heart burn.  Not sure how much displeased i was in eating at a  restaurant"}
{"text":"We went at around 2:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday. So there was I think only one server but she was really nice and we loved the food! Tots were so good looks like a fun place for happy hour."}
{"text":"Had an amazing fun night here. Courtney our server was amazing!!!  Love her!  Super friendly and courteous. The food. Omg. The food. Had the bacon sliders and tater tots. Sat on the patio and it was nice to sit with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, but just about the worst service you can imagine.   Ordered a beer 10 minutes ago and still waiting."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed.  Brought a large group to celebrate the day after our nephew's wedding. They were notified that we were coming and yet completely unprepared! Food was eventually good but we waited a long time. Nice atmoaphere. Suggest reservations and confirming reservations w management. Sad for bride and groom. Bummed!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute joke. Bartender shook my martini for 30 seconds and tasted like water. Ordered the mussels and they served me a bowl that had 9 unopened. So we're up to an un drinkable martini and half an appetizer. Should have known better when I sat down- the bar looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food isn't that great.  Just your general bar food.  The beer is awesome and cold though, and there's plenty to select from.  I'm a lover of Samuel Adams.  They seem to always have that.    Location is a busy place.  They're right on the end though, and a movie theatre is just a few steps away."}
{"text":"We arrived to Bar Louie at Legacy for a work lunch with eleven people, we had a reservation and our table was ready (the place was practically empty this time of day).  The service was very slow and confusing as two servers attempted to take drink orders and people ended up with duplicate orders. The food was slow to come out of the kitchen and was brought out in waves, the first people were finished eating by the time the last person got her food. Once we were finished eating one person in our party asked for a box for her lunch....the box came about 20 minutes later (again, slow service) by this time she decided not to take the remainder of her lunch home. On average the food was good but it was nothing we couldn't have gotten at any other restaurant/bar in Cleveland. So if you have to go out of your way to go to Bar Louie save yourself time and just go anywhere!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for hh before a show or game. Great prices, food, drinks and amazing staff. Chip great mgr accommodating and professional. Griff and Stacy at bar sit near them for amazing service."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks and dinner and had a poor experience.  While the food was just all right, and the drink selection about the same, the service makes me not even consider coming back.  I sat at the bar with a friend and there were 4-5 girls working the bar, only one of which would ask how we were doing. We had to flag someone down to take our food order because nobody would acknowledge us.  Maybe it's a bad place to work because most of these girls looked miserable.  We got in around the end of happy hour and there was barely any seating.  I wouldn't recommend this place, hit up the Thirsty Lion instead."}
{"text":"good place. scene is urban professionals. liked the outdoor area, good people watching. later we had one of the back rooms reserved since we were a party of 10+. service was awesome. two waitresses, always smiling,  remembering every order and always time for a quick chat. many restaurants can learn something in regards to effective service from this place! food looked great (i didn't try because i had already eaten) and people seemed to really like it. i'll definitely be back when i'm in cleveland again."}
{"text":"It's a cool trendy spot in the University area. Drinks are good and the food is decent.. Service is lackluster.. Will visit again, maybe it was just an off day."}
{"text":"Consistently meh.  The only noteworthy thing I've had here is the Fried Louie. Every time I've tried something else, I've been sorely disappointed. I've heard some of their other burgers are also decent.  I had a salad once, and it was very wilty and old. The Mac and cheese was pretty dull/bland. I'm really not sure why I've been here so many times haha. I guess it's an easy place to go with a group, when the line at Cheesecake is too long"}
{"text":"This place is extremely uneducated on cooking for food allergies/celiac. Which I think is unacceptable for a restaurant. Told them I had celiac disease and the waiter had to check about 50 times if what I inquired was gluten free. They told me the tater tots were gluten free so I ordered those and after eating them I find out they were fried in the same fryer as gluten containing foods. Dear Bar Louie: celiac disease is extremely common (1 in 100) and it is a very serious autoimmune disease that is triggered by gluten.. Any cross contamination (using the same knife on gluten, same fryer, etc.. Causes the same reaction as if you were to just eat the gluten itself. Please educate your kitchen and staff"}
{"text":"My first time here my husband and I were invited to a birthday celebration. Mature environment, good music (the live band wasn't playing but music was still good! Food was very tasteful. Wait time on food was a little long but I was hungry so I didn't hold that against them...this time We laughed, took pics and enjoyed a great night!"}
{"text":"The food is typical bar food, it's reasonably good, but never wonderful. I had a burger there one day and it was a little better than average, another day the burger was overcooked and dry. They have some good happy hour specials. It's an OK place to stop in if you're in the area, but not worth  a special trip."}
{"text":"We have been here for over 40 minutes and our food order has yet to arrive. If your hungry find another place in Tempe marketplace."}
{"text":"The food was good but it took 40 mins to get a B.L.T. and mac and cheese. It was mid day and not busy. Our server, Nadia, was friendly. Ambiance is nice. Moscow Mule cups are tin instead of copper."}
{"text":"Louis, a bartender, took excellent care of me. I prefer to read, write and be left alone and that is precisely what Louis did. He was kind and helpful but he never interrupted my process. This was my first time at Bar Louie's and I will return precisely for Louis. When a server can intimate the needs of a patron, that should tell you that you are dining at a good place. The food and the drink were exactly what I was looking for. But Louis made it perfect for me."}
{"text":"I see mixed reviews on this place. Service was fantastic by Noel and Ryan. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Flatbread which was pleasing  to the palette. This coupled with a No Da Red Rumble draft (local brew) made my meal complete. You can enjoy conversation with the staff or watch the ball game. Your choice. I will come again."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour M-F 4-7 pm.  Try the Effen martini!  Parkng is a breeze in the voluminous Crocker Park lots.  This is a good Windy City import for CLE."}
{"text":"Do Not Eat Here!! Yesterday around 5 o'clock I dropped into Bar Louie along with a friend. We sat outside because it's rare to have such beautiful weather in AZ around this time! We looked over the menu and I noticed on 4 occasions two waitresses walked by and never stopped by! We were there for another TWENTY MINUTES  and after people after people around us were given waters and no one still stopped by we left! I loved Bar Louie after a movie screening and now I will never ever eat here again!! Worse SERVICE EVER!! DO NOT GO HERE!!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Good service. Mouse scurrying across the restaurant floor. That was a bit of a downer on an otherwise good experience."}
{"text":"This is my wife and I's go to spot before a concert and a game. Super attentive staff.  We love the loaded nachos and the draft selection is always solid. It is great if you are in a hurry for an app they always accommodate when we are in a hurry."}
{"text":"I had low expectations, but low was being generous. It was a busy event night, but the joy on the faces of all the other patrons only poured salt into my wounds. Which isn't as bad as the two beers that were poured on my friend by the server. Once they found a dirty rag to help with the spill 7 minutes later, I thought things were looking up. And then the food came. Pretty sure it was cooked five hours prior, especially the calamari and the lettuce chicken wraps, with no visible chicken. We weren't given utensils or plates, so it made sharing dishes super interesting. After begging for our check three times, we ran for the hills to some delicious pretzels at Rivertown.  I wanted to love this place for the location and outdoor seating, but sadly I cannot even like it."}
{"text":"Horrible service never cleared the table we had so many plates had to eat around them had to go find a random waitress to get the bill if I could leave 0 stars I would"}
{"text":"Typical bar Louie, horrible service just like all of them I've been to. Never believe the wait time the hostess tells you and at dinner time expect the slowest possible service. I've been to 3 different locations and it's like this at all of them, sad since its a cool environment, if you can get over the semi pricey drinks. We also got chicken nachos and had about 4 quarter size piece of chicken in the whole thing. Sorry bar Louie 3 strikes and you're out."}
{"text":"We visited this location today with a reservation for a large party of 20. It took approximately 20 minutes to be approached by a server...and it literally took 45 minutes to get all of our drinks to the table. Long story short, after 2 hrs of waiting for food (including being told \"I'll check on it\" \"it's coming out right\" \"we will compensate things in the end\"), we decided to leave and are unlikely to return. Oddly enough, the restaurant didn't appear to be crowded at all. And we even said we didn't have to eat all at once, that they could bring it out as it was ready...never made it past the drinks. A rather unfortunate experience!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch the food came out fast and my beer was cheap. Had a good experience. Thanks Brandy!"}
{"text":"Can't review the food or drink because my party left after not being acknowledged. Sat down at the bar around 10:00 pm (posted closing time was 2:00 am) and the place was empty. Multiple employees and bartenders visible. Male bartender looked at us multiple times and said nothing. We left after 10-15 minutes. There are many better options in the area like The Foundry and Southern Tier."}
{"text":"Love the food but don't love the wait. There are so many appetizers that are great and even the entrees far surpass anything you would expect from a bar. It's not all greasy and there's a ton of variety. I went two days ago and it took forever for our food to come but other than that, I love this place and will return hoping that was a fluke."}
{"text":"The meatball al forno and chicken gumbo soup were great. For main course we had fish and chips, voodoo chicken which was incredible. This is our second visit and we will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Bar Louie countless times because I work in the area. Generally, it's for a few beers, which their beer selection is pretty decent. However, the last 3 times I've gone here for lunch, the food was less than edible. I'm not sure if they have a new lunch time cook or what. But it's going down hill. During my last visit, I took two bites of my rubbery chicken sandwich and slid it away for the bartender to dispose of. She was nice enough to by me a beer, so I opted for the liquid lunch."}
{"text":"They screwed up pretty much Everything on a take out order. Here's a tip. Write stuff down instead of standing there nodding as I give you a large order. The other locations are way better."}
{"text":"It was just there. $7 for a vodka soda that really lacked in the vodka department. Service was that of a dive bar, hell I think you may get more personality at a dive. Wouldn't revisit this corporate place."}
{"text":"At bar Louie as we speak and the service is horrible we ordered shots and our glasses were stained and dirty. My cousin ordered the tuna and it was over cooked and burnt and I had to send my first drink back because I was nasty I would never return!!!"}
{"text":"Bar Louie in the North Shore has the most accommodating, friendly staff you could ever ask for. We hosted a last minute surprise party for a friend and everything from the quality of the food to the service was exceptional. Missy was the greatest most attentive server ever!  Kudos to Missy and Bar Louie!!!"}
{"text":"Jessica C. was absolutely amazing! Very friendly and attentive! I've been to Bar Louie several times, but my experience with Jessica has surpassed all of my times! We come as a group from my company, and this time stands out as THE BEST service I've ever had there. Thanks Jessica! The food and drinks are great too. Always love the specials! The salmon sliders are the best!!!"}
{"text":"When we walked in the place was empty and it was self seating. So we walked around trying to find a CLEAN table! They were all filthy. Also the bathrooms were horrendous!!!! I will never return. The waitstaff were all sitting around on their phones and some were singing and dancing around. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered clams... they were bad. They didn't open! Gave them back... with the reduced to salty sauce and still not opened... i had to wait for ever... Asked for butter... (they don't serve it) so I got a piece of old butter from the refrigerator. After explained that I was hungry I finally got 3 pretzels with strange dipping."}
{"text":"It's amazing that this place is still in business.  We went there because we wanted to watch the baseball game.  We asked the server and bar tender twice to put it on.  They left the 2 out of 3 tvs off at the bar and the one that was on was on Women's College Softball.   They sat us in a booth with a giant hole in the seat.  This kind of damage to a booth did not just happen, it must have been this way for months if not longer.  I wonder if they will ever fix it.  We had to move booths because the seat was so uncomfortable with a hole.  Server was slow to get us drinks, burger was ordered medium and it came out well done.  I would have sent it back but it was impossible to get the server's attention.  Pretty sure the tatter tots are Ore Ida frozen tots.  Tables are sticky, wobbly and gross.  Probably not going back to this place again.  I would have loved to speak with the manager, but he never came out.  Oh Well... Lost customer."}
{"text":"I have been to the Columbus and Westlake locations and have always had an amazing experience. When we walked into the southpark location it seemed promising at first. There were no signs that said \"seat yourself\" once we sat we waited 15 minutes with no waitress and it was not busy at all. A manager even came over to our table when we were browsing the menu and set 2 plates on our table but didnt say a word and just walked away. We waited 10 more minutes and then just left. I'll just stick with going to the other locations unless this turns into a place where you are seated."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I have been to Bar Louie quite a few times...just not this location, and have had great experiences. We had planned our vacation in AZ for New Year's Eve and decided that we would get a table at Bar Louie at this location since it was close to the house we rented and near where festivities would be happening. Looking back now, I would have NEVER decided this was the place to spend our money.   The night started fine as we had paid for a table to be reserved so we got to skip the big line and go straight to the table. Got to the table, seemed fine at first, waitress Taylor was excellent. She is one reason this place gets one star. A few minutes later the \"entertainment\" started. The reason it is in quotes is because it is nowhere near what I would consider pleasant entertainment. We were seated SO close to the music and it was so loud that I couldn't hear my husband speak and he was sitting right next to me. I almost lost my voice within the first hour of being there due to trying to yell to our friends seated across the table from us. After putting up with it for over an hour, we decided this is NOT what we expected after spending hundreds of dollars so we asked to be moved. This started a chain of events that will prevent me from EVER spending money at any Bar Louie ever again.   We were first told that there was a table outside that we could have...turns out it was a 5 top for 7 people to squeeze around and was actually right next to the speaker. When we said that would not work, especially for the amount of money we paid, we asked to speak to a manager. Come to find out management was one of the biggest let downs of all. Taylor, one of the managers, was supposed to speak with my husband and he tried his hardest to absolutely avoid him completely. It was so loud in there my husband wanted to speak outside to have an adult conversation with a manager and it turns out that it was too much to ask. Once my husband tracked him down, we were informed that we had to put up with our table because \"we picked it\". Again you can notice the quotes....when we reserved a table we were NOT given the option to pick a table...in which apparently everyone else who spent the same money we did got to choose their table. First slap in the face. He then continued to tell us there was nothing he would do and offer absolutely NO discount to our tab. Second slap in the face. After my husband voiced his utter disbelief that a company would insult paying customers and treat them so terribly, we were \"granted\" an $80 discount. Peanuts compared to the amount of money we were spending.   The only other person that earned this place that one star is the hostess Maddie. She was the only saving grace this night as she tried her hardest to help us out. She found 3 tiny round bar tables and placed them outside for us. Found us two chairs, and got us away from the head throbbing music to toast to the New Year. She went above and beyond that night for us and is the only positive thing besides our waitress that any of us can mention from that night.   Now we are on to the third and final slap to the face. My husband checked his credit card statement and realized later that they not only charged us for the food and drinks we consumed that night but also $400 to reserve the table. When making the reservation Patrick, also a manager, explained they were taking his credit card to hold the table and that nothing would be charged; a bold faced lie. He also explained that $200 would be charged to the table that night with a $200 credit towards food and drinks and then we would pay the difference. We ended up splitting the additional $200 between us and left a great tip since our waitress was amazing, unlike the treatment we had received from management. To top it off the manager who had tried so hard to avoid my husband, Taylor, brought the check to the table and explained that he took off $80 and the rest is the \"TOTAL\" amount we owed. Once we got home, my husband found out they have NOT removed the $400 they charged his card, plus kept all the money we had spent on top of that. After multiple conversations with Patrick, they refused to do anything about the additional charge.   So to round the whole experience out, this was one of the WORST places I have ever spent any of my money at and will refuse to ever do it again, no matter the location. I rarely ever write reviews to places, but I felt an obligation to let people know that this establishment has the worst customer service and management staff I have ever dealt with. I will continue to tell everyone I know (and don't know for that matter) to NEVER come here EVER."}
{"text":"Horrible experience here for a group weekday lunch.  We waited over 1.25 hours with no food.  The excuse was not enough staff in the kitchen.  Stay away."}
{"text":"The food was really good, loved the tempura shrimp and the hummus plate was a great healthy option. Service was okay and the Manhattan I ordered could have used some help. Overall a nice place to hangout and have a few drinks"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a 4th of July dinner and were not pleased.        First, the wait was 10 minutes, then we moved to a different section, and waited 8 minutes. We then notified a nearby waitress, and no one came. We asked again, and finally someone came. The food was very good, though when we ordered tacos it took a 1/2 hour.      Other than the wait, the food was good."}
{"text":"So tonight we went to Bar Louie. It was set yourself so we sat outside. Beautiful night to sit outside. First time eating here and the food was ok. I ordered the Louie sandwich which was dry and little to no flavor to it. My wife ordered the beef brisket sliders. Those where actually really good. They had a nice smokey flavor with a little kick to the sauce. Oh I almost forgot about the house salad. It was ok as well. Dressing was over powering the lettuce and not that many cucumbers but alot of carrots. So overall I would give them a three and a half stars."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but not much else. We sat at the bar and had to wait 5 minutes for the previous dishes to be cleared. She didn't wipe down the bar so had to deal with old food crumbs while we sat there. 5 minutes to even ask for our drink order while walking by a dozen times. Another 10 minutes to ask for our food order even though we were clearly finished with the menus. Food came but without silverware or plates. Asked the food runner for them but she didn't bring. After 5 minutes had to get the bartenders attention to get place settings. Food was okay. Paid a $23 tab with a $100 bill and she gave all change in $5 dollar bills instead of looking in another register for $20s.   Oh and she brought a burger and fries to the guy next to us and spilled half the fries on the bar. Didn't even notice let alone offer to bring new fries to the customer.   Can't believe we tipped $5 on the bill, should have gone less.   Not our first bad experience with the service. They just don't seem to care or pay much attention beyond themselves."}
{"text":"This place sucked. The waitress hit on my husband, took 20 minutes to get us water, then passed us off to another waiter who claimed she had to leave (she didn't - she was there well after we left). The food was mediocre at best and over-priced. The beer we ordered even came with ice floating on top of it instead of head. We definitely won't be returning here."}
{"text":"Went with a couple friends and it had to be the worst restaurant/bar I have ever been to. 1st the service is horrible. 2nd they were out of about every kind of beer we asked for. 3rd same as 2 only with food this time, everything we tried to order they were out of. 4th it took so long for everything to get to us. 5th food is just down right over priced slop. Especially the macaroni and cheese. I would not feed that to my worst enemy. I had to hit one star to post this. Lol"}
{"text":"Food was ok. I ordered a fried Louie and ordered it med well. But my egg came out overdone and burger well done. My coworker had tacos and the tortillas were not even warm. Cold and breaking apart. Upside was the Drinks are really good."}
{"text":"I hear all these ads about how good the food is at Bar Louie and they make me laugh.  I have eaten at this location twice, though all Bar Louies have the same menu so I'm sure the food is the same everywhere.    Last time I was here, I came here because I wanted to watch some NFL playoff games.  I had a nice seat at the bar right in front of a TV.  I ordered a cider, which they were out of.  So I ordered a Christmas Ale, forgetting that Bar Louie is one of the bars that serves Christmas Ale in a tiny rip-off snifter and charges you more than 5 dollars for it.  Give me a friggin break.  You can go two doors down to Nauti Mermaid and get high A.B.V. beers in normal-sized glasses for a normal price.  I had a burger, which was fine.  There is nothing good or bad about the burgers here.  Fries were ok.  I was there drinking for quite a while so I also ordered a bowl of chicken pot pie soup.  It sounded really delicious.  Unfortunately it was gross.  It was almost a solid.  Probably was the bottom of a bag that had dehydrated in the bottom of a heating table.  There was ne'er a piece of chicken to be seen, and the little puff pastry bits on top were too moist, like they had been put on top and then the whole bowl had been zapped in a microwave, which is probably what happened.  The taste was overwhelmingly salty.  Yick.  I would never eat here again, and will only drink here when desperate.  All of their drinks are overpriced and I don't know why, because the atmosphere isn't anything special."}
{"text":"When we arrived we were told to sit anywhere. We walked the entire length of the establishment before we found a clean table, even though there were plenty of empty tables. After a twenty wait, staff approached our table and asked if we had been helped. They apologized for the wait and took our order. 30 minutes later our order was brought to us . Our food was cold and burgers dry. The two stars are given because our waitress apologized for inconvenience and dessert was on her."}
{"text":"Alright, first review after signing up on Yelp. This place made it necessary. Bar Louie in Crocker park has the worst service. Nothing has changes since it was Blake's Seafood. The server was consistently late on our drinks and when he did finally get our drinks, he consistently left our empty glasses on the table. He also left our plates on the table after we were done.  Additionally, when I ordered a Stoli orange and soda, he Said ok and walked away.  The bar doesn't have Stoli o so he subbed Kettle orange, an up charge. I would have definitely agreed to the Kettle of he offered it, but he didn't.  He do ask what was wrong after I bussed our table and made a comment for the bartender.  I explained to him that if I had ordered a strip steak, they were out, and he subbed a filet, it would be wrong.  Bottom line: bad experience, poor service, and to top it off, the bathroom was horrible."}
{"text":"It's okay. The bartender we had was really stingy with drinks. Not that we wanted more but she purposely under filled our drinks. The lettuce wraps were okay. Not bad, not good. It's okay."}
{"text":"Well the first time I went was in March they forgot to put the pasta in my Tuscan pasta. This monday went for lunch and had horrible experience again. Today i asked my husband to get me the same Tuscan pasta and it never taste the same is full of spinach and barely any pasta or chicken. I am done with this place will not eat here again. May i also add it doesnt have tomatoes in pasta like it should.. every time i went they were not bussy we were the only customers.."}
{"text":"Bar service was decent! It went downhill when we decided to move to a table. The bartender told us just to grab a table once one became available and he would send a server. The place wasn't too busy but we were a big group so we waited for a big enough table. So one out in the patio area opened up and we took it. In that particular section, there was only one other group of people which were getting ready to leave. The server didn't acknowledge our presence, even with her going back and forth to that group many times. So after what seemed like 30 minutes of waiting we asked her if she could please get us a server, and we were polite as we didn't want bad vibes flowing around. She thought about it for a while and said she was going to look for our server. Another 15 or so minutes went by and nothing. We called her back again and it seem like she didn't like that we called on her again. She responded again with I will go look for your server but then she said I guess I can take your order. WOW but anyways we placed our orders. Another table opened up inside and we decided to move since it was a bit on the cool side and we didn't want our food to get cold to fast. Well we might as well stayed outside, some of our food seemed as if it had been sitting for a while. The cheese was a bit on the tuff side, fries were cold, one of our plates (veggie wrap) wasn't even brought out. So when we told the server not to make the wrap anymore she said she would send her manager. It took a while for the manager to come to our table. When he finally did, we explained our issues, he did apologize and said that they ran out of veggies for the veggie wrap we never received and said they would give us a 20% discount on our bill. That's fine but why weren't we told immediately after they found out about their veggie issue, we would of placed another order for something else?!?!?! Then the server went to get us our bill, she was a ways away but near enough for us to observe her. Another server approached her and she looked towards our way and back to the other server, what ever they said to each other didn't seem nice. But again what ever, they will not be getting our business again. I do wish them (Bar Louie) well and much success."}
{"text":"The place look interesting  but we found out was not as good as the reviews.  Who orders a Bltt and not get the Tomato and the lettuce.   Or the Tocco and not get the tortillas.  No french fries and tater tots  were cold.  All this after waiting over 30 minutes for the meal.  Would not recommend  this to anyone  was very disappointed.   Manager was so worried  about the tv but not the customers.   We're here  10/30/16 about 2:00."}
{"text":"Food is Shitty probably would be good if they had a cook that knew how to cook it correctly.  Staff is ok no complaints drinks are good as well"}
{"text":"After a long day of playing the slots I was hungry and decided to walk down to the north shore. Now I've eaten at bar Louie's before but this one just opened in the north shore and they been promoting it like crazy. I grab a seat at the bar ordered a drink and was immediately asked for a card to start a tab.... Ummmmm ok not damn boo I ain't gonna drink and run on you..... Never asked if I wanted anything to eat...  So I decided on the Thai flat bread and lettuce wraps to go for my son . My flatbread came out looked pretty good. It was salty as all hell. The flatbread was pretty good but the Thai sauce was toooo salty. So I dunno I won't totally write them off but not the best service or meal"}
{"text":"I think the food and atmosphere is great.  I have been there during the day and it is also great for a 3 year old.  They always have friendly staff and cold beer.  I recommend the veggie wrap.  Healthy AND delicious.  The beer is also reasonable."}
{"text":"I went with a party of 7 on Sunday to watch the end of the world cup and luckily there were a lot of open tables (first sign).  someone in our party got there several minutes before everyone else and after about 10 minutes no one came over to greet us or take our drink order. someone had to go to the bar to ask the bartender to send over a server. everything about our food/drink orders took forever. the server didn't remember to bring a beer for one of our guests and he only ordered 2 but got charged for 3. the food took an hour and a half to come out and we were one of about 4 groups in the entire restaurant. when we finally got our food, mine came out completely wrong. just terrible service and there's a ton of other great restaurants in crocker park."}
{"text":"Went to Ohio for my step daughters baby shower and stopped by at bar Louie's and the food was alright they need to step it up a little more it was super packed no tables"}
{"text":"Went to happy hour at Bar Louie 1/2 price select apps  draft beers martinis and wine all under $5.50 craft draft beers $3.25 our server Kayla was knowledgeable about beer and food menu the market garden seasonal draft was excellent martini was cold and refreshing szechuan wings were good as well as the loaded tots. Don't know if they always do this but got a card for free app on next visit would go again."}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get.  I got a burger, fries and water.  It was over $13 with tip!  It's good but not great and there are better options in the area.  I did hear if you are a heavy drinker they have a good bar, but can only assume the prices there are on the high side.  Nice inside but again the price makes this a place of no return for me."}
{"text":"Adequately good food. I agree, Applebees but less lame. Adult beverages are under poured. Had the street tacos, must say the chicken was tasty and the guacamole and avocado was freshly, fre"}
{"text":"The hostess? Does she know what she's doing? No. We went on a Saturday night and she said we'd have to wait 1 hour. There are 2 large tables in the front (seats 6). Each table only had 2 upper teen girls seated at each table. There were so many people waiting in line for tables, it made no sense. Bunch of creepy old guys at the bar asking their friend to \"watch their seat\" while they go to the bathroom or have a smoke. We just wanted something to eat before a movie. Not to a meat market- thanks but no thanks. Gross."}
{"text":"ZERO stars. Tried to have a business lunch here today and waited for our food to come for 90 minutes. Yes, that is ONE AND A HALF HOUR!!!!! At the 45 minute mark they tried to make it better by saying our original server moved to the kitchen to help cook! That should have been a sign! Our food NEVER came and we had to go back to our meeting very hungry."}
{"text":"Visited at least 5times and the service is always poor. I only attend as a guest of \"parties\" and I simply know to order just a drink and an appetizer,  both of which are YUM. The food takes forever to come out and for  Bar Louise to be known for their burgers...ummm they are not my favorite (sorry). The atmosphere is lovely and I love the seating decor but ultimately poor service and slow service keeps me from attending on my own."}
{"text":"Extremely loud inside the bar. The bartenders are ignorant to drinks other than what's on tap or the old standby well drinks. They are rude and lifeless."}
{"text":"Oh my god!  Sat down immediately, good. Took order quickly, good. I had to ask again where is my beer, WTH. Finally came out. Food finally came out. My was good. The wife ordered Mac n cheese with chicken. The mac n cheese tasted burnt. The waitress forgot to take it off the bill. We had to remind her. Unfortunately, the waitress seemed nice and overwhelmed but very doubtful we will be back. So disappointed!  If there was an option for zero stars would have given that."}
{"text":"For me, my experience was typical. The service was friendly, nothing special though. Made sure to get our food out quickly, at least quicker than what I'm reading from the other reviews. My boyfriend grumbled about the portion sizes, but if he could have it his way he would eat an entire cow in one sitting. I do quite enjoy their Creme Brulee very much."}
{"text":"I lived in Columbus for a while and I used to go to the Bar Louie in Easton every so often.  I was always VERY pleased when I would go there, so I was excited to go to the Bar Louie in Legacy Village.  When I walked in, my first thought was, ohh, okay.  This place is cool.  Most of the people in there were young, attractive professionals.  I was like, woo-whoo, nice spot.  Good find.  So we go in the back (because I like to chat a lot when I go out to eat) and we order.  My friend orders a Blue Moon... they were out.  He then orders another beer.  The waiter comes back, says they don't have that beer, either.  My friend is then like, okay, what beers DO you have?  And then he picks one of those.  So then we order.  He orders buffalo wings and I order a blackberry something brie salad.  I forget what the name was exactly.  But it was supposed to have some fruit and some brie in it.  I also ordered a side of mac & cheese.  (What can I say... I was in the mood for comfort food!)  The waiter leaves, then comes back to say they don't have any mac & cheese, either.    At this point we are all laughing.  The waiter was really cool.  I liked him.  He was really apologetic.  The manager came over and was like, well, we got hit bad this weekend and we're due to get a shipment in tomorrow.  But he didn't seem to really care all that much.  I dunno, I was kind of over it by that point.  We got our food.  My salad was super small -- it looked like a side salad.  There were four blackberries, three small pieces of brie, three little squares of fruit.  The lettuce was wilted, there was barely any dressing on it.  It was pretty tasteless.  We had shared two appetizers as well -- sliders and spinach artichoke dip.  The dip was really good.  We ate most of that.  The majority of the sliders came home with me and my dog ate most of them.  They were meh... I've honestly had better sliders from the frozen food section of the grocery store.  The buffalo wings were quite good.  I tried a couple.  I would get those again.    I forgot to mention -- I got a strawberry fizz.  It was quite potent.  As in, it seemed like there was a lot of alcohol in it.  Surprisingly so.  The taste was all right I guess.  Not great.    Overall, I was unimpressed.  With all the great restaurants around Legacy Village, there probably won't be any need for me to come back here.  Then again, maybe if I came when the kitchen was stocked, it would've been a different experience.  But as I'm reading the other reviews on here, it seems unlikely.  Service was great, atmosphere was great, drink and food options and execution were not.  If this place had better food and drink, I would've given it a 4 or maybe even a 5.  But overall the experience was dismally disappointing.  If I go back I will try other stuff on the menu and tweak this review if necessary."}
{"text":"This location of this bar is perfect if you are really into starvation scavenger hunts. After locating this diamond in the rough I was pleasantly greeted by a man having a midlife crisis that was apparently my fault for not seating myself. After salvaging the rest of this mans life by not standing on \"his\" floor and finding a seat we were greeted by a pleasantly sassy waitress who loved forgetting our drinks. When we would ask about a menu option we were pelted with a verbal slap similar to that of a seagull \"WHAAT!!\". After my eardrums where healed with copious amounts of alcohol I left only half satisfied"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but slow service and bar staff could be more attentive. I'll go back but not on a regular basis."}
{"text":"The service was terribly slow. And management did not seem to care about remedying the situation"}
{"text":"Typically I'll hit this place before or after a movie at the Harkins next door.     Good selection of beer and wine along with a decent variety of mixed drinks (if that's your thing).   I've never had a bad meal here, but I'm struggling to remember what I had to eat on my last couple of visits.   So the food is good but not anything that will really stick out in your mind.      The patio is nice when it's not 100+ degrees out, the interior is very nice when it's 100+ degrees out.      I won't go out of my way to go here, but I also won't say no."}
{"text":"Worst service in all of downtown , I'm still not sure why they are busy. You literally wait at your table for 5-10 minutes before being greeted, they are always under staffed. The drinks are not as good as they promise on the menu , to top it off the last time I ordered Ahi Tuna and rice the rice was as hard as a rock. Probably will never be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places, and they have thee Best Lemon Drop Martini's... Plus the Bar Tender looks like Clark Kent(Superman) very handsome guy"}
{"text":"I came here twice while in town for work. Both time the service, food and drinks were excellent! Plenty of TVs for you to watch. Full bar and unique cocktails. Great specials (happy hour, $1 burger night, Wednesday Beer Night, etc) the food I ate was great and everything I saw come out of the kitchen looked equally as good!"}
{"text":"I had great hopes for this place as i have season hockey tickets. The happy hour drink specials are good.  The event menu is not great but ok.  The issue I have is the food takes forever.  They really need to get the back of the house together. Also, train your staff on the seat numbers around the bar.  I was repeatidly aaked if i ordered certain dishes continously and it is annoying."}
{"text":"Went here twice for lunch while in town, since I've been to other BL locations and always liked the food here.  Got the build your own fish tacos, which were fresh and very good.  But the second trip here I had to get the turkey burger with giardiniera and tater tots, mmm.  Been to several locations and none of them disappoint.  They've always been friendly and it's always clean, two important things for me when eating."}
{"text":"Where can I even begin?  We were here during Memorial Day weekend with a party of 20.  Everywhere we went was packed and the wait was long so we settled on having a quick bite at Bar Louie.  HUUUUUGE mistake!  When we walked in we seated ourselves. There were not many people there. The place was an oven.  We waited to order our drinks and those took forever to come out.  Beer was fine, but all of the sodas were watered down.  The waitress said the heat might have melted the ice too quickly and replaced them.  Less ice and the sodas were still watered down.  We placed our food orders.  Half hour later she came back and told someone in our party they were out of nachos for their appetizer.  I went to the restroom  and found the most disgusting toilets.  Rings around the toilet and black crud in 3 of the 4 stalls.  There were holes in the wall and paper everywhere.  When I got back to the table (about 45 minutes after arriving) our food was still not out.  Finally an hour after arriving our food starts to come out.  Half of our party finished eating and the other half still did not have food.  Waitress never came back to bring more beer (in a bar!!).  Three people in our party ordered a Crispy Chicken Melt and the chicken was overcooked on the outside and still FROZEN on the inside.  SERIOUSLY?!?!?!  Several other dishes were brought out cold.  I do not think I have ever had such a bad experience eating out.  To top it off we were billed for the frozen chicken sandwiches.  We spoke to a manager who removed the charges and wound up closing down the kitchen for the night.  Spare yourself, do not go to Bar Louie."}
{"text":"Bar Louie at the waterfront is my favorite afternoon restaurant.  All the servers and bartenders are accommodating and social.   One real stand out is Nicole. She is an incredible bartender. Efficient at her job and very personable !!!"}
{"text":"Found a piece of plastic in the food. Almost choked on it. They didnt even have the courtesy to send the manager to apologize. Never going back!"}
{"text":"Valentine's Day! Terrible service. Waitress wasn't attentive at all which would be understandable if it were extremely busy but it was just steady. Food is overpriced for portions.  Small flies flying around restaurant. I investigated myself to see where from and found fly eggs hatching from dirty toilet paper on the floor in the men's room near the corner by the plunger. Mortified by this, my wife and I quickly finished and left. I'll never visit again."}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service was less than acceptable.  Went on a Monday night with a virtually empty floor and it took us 15 min to order drinks.  We probably wouldn't have been served if the the bar manager hadn't noticed us. Bar manager was awesome, but as soon as he left the service just went back to nearly nothing. For a quick snack before a movie it took us over an hour to order, eat, and pay for sliders and a beer."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and the food! The portions were humungous and we got there Saturday close to the evening time when a DJ started playing music. I loved the setting and music.  Definitely going back before I leave Cleveland."}
{"text":"Sadly a disappointment... I went there with a group of friends.. I must say our drinks were wonderful.. however, our waitress and our food were not.. she forgot several items, never refilled our drinks (ice tea, sofa) the bar tender overheard me complaining about my drink as I could see it sitting at bar and bartender brought it over and refilled ice tea and Coke.. the saddest part as it was lunch time and there were seriously 4 tables in the entire restaurant.. this was on Saturday 11/5/16.. my friends food was burnt (lettuce wraps) I had a burger which was extremly over cooked but I chose to eat it anyway... I usually give a place a second chance if one or other problem... this place had both bad food terrible service (except for bartender she knew her job and apparently had to waitresses job as well)..."}
{"text":"We grabbed a bite before a movie. We usually frequent Yard House but every now and again, we try one of the other eateries. We stopped in on a Thursday night. It was fairly busy, service was ok, our server never brought silverware or napkins with our appetizer, and we had to wait a bit for a second beer.  Started with Turkey Melt Sliders. Good bun, but salty turkey. We both had burgers, the Louie was better than the Angry Louie.   Nothing about the place impressed us enough to want to return. Looks like Yard House will continue to get our business in the future."}
{"text":"My first visit to the restaurant was during happy hour and it was definitely NOT a \"happy\" hour. Our waitress ignored our table the entire time and we were only able to get one drink during the two hours of \"happy hour\" and we had to practically yell at her to bring us waters. This was the first time my friends and I didn't even want to leave a tip for our server because when we began to question her delays, she was nothing but rude and curt with us.   After my first visit, I should have learned my lesson never to return back, but it was a last resort and was forced to go to Bar Louie. After standing in the entryway, someone finally walked up to us and said it was open seating, so we found a table near the kitchen hoping that would be a great spot since the wait staff was sure to be constantly passing through the area. We waited for 20 minutes until someone finally stopped and asked if we wanted water, etc. I was appalled at how long it took someone to notice us sitting there looking around at the abundance of wait staff that was just meandering around the restaurant doing nothing.   Ordered the bruschetta which was not tasty, and got the heck out of there. Won't be returning to Bar Louie anytime soon."}
{"text":"I like sitting at the bar for a Bloody Mary, but the bartenders just aren't that friendly. The one today didn't ask how my food was, didn't ask if I wanted another drink, which I did. I opted to close the tab and leave, head to Thirsty Lion. I've worked in the industry, it's hard for me to tip less than 20%, but not here."}
{"text":"Bar pooie...Do not come to this restaurant! The service is absolutely atrocious. We came with a large party (9 people which I understand can be more challenging) and never received something as simple as water. We ordered, after a significant wait, (on a slow Tuesday night btw) and then the orders came out at different times with 3 orders never arriving. The management created excuses about technology and never came over to offer a simply apology. The way this was handled was as immature as my lead in to this review. Unless your goal is to complain and get a discounted meal for poor service (which will be probable with this restaurant), save your appetite for a restaurant with a better experience."}
{"text":"The servers could not have been more lazy, do they understand they are in a service industry based on tips?...waited 10 min at bar to be acknowledge and asked for a menu... she came back 20 min later to ask if I wanted something. Who does your hiring, an ex McDonalds employee?  I expect the food to be average as per your price points but the service?... Place has potential but management needs a shake up!"}
{"text":"Good food and a great restaurant/bar to replace Darcy McGees. Their food is very good and they have great drink specials. They also did a very nice job remodeling the inside it's very warm and inviting"}
{"text":"The bartender Brandon was the saving grace of this particular evening. My boyfriend and I came to Bar Louie North Shore for a late dinner. We were greeted by Brandon and we sat outside. The server outside Kenny , I believe his name is, did not acknowledge us in any way. My boyfriend went inside and the bartender ended up taking our order and serving us. He was  very engaging and apologized for the server, who never even looked our way, but continued to serve other customers. I give this location 3 stars because of Brandon only. Thanks for saving our night!"}
{"text":"I just walked into Bar Louie while we wait for our table at Burgatory. We sat down at the bar and one bartender half acknowledged us and said he would \"be with us in a minute\". We continued to sit there and wait. While she talked to other employees and walked around the bar to talk to the servers. The only other bartender was slowly walking around the other end of the bar. When she finally did make her way to our end she greeted the people who just sat down and ignored us who had been sitting there for 7 minutes. This was NOT a busy time and therefore has no excuse for us having to wait more than 2 minutes for a drink. We got up and walked out and will never be back. I have never had a good experience with Bar Louie no matter where it has been. Their customer service is always subpar. Awful."}
{"text":"food was ok.  service was HORRIBLE!  We went 4 weeks in a row on Tuesday after work, Burger Night.  every week there was an issue.  first week- sat there for 15 no server, no water no drinks.  eventually it was fine.  second week- ordered beer, received wrong beers.  ordered food waited for 30 minutes no eating utensils or napkins. sat outside so we rinsed our hands with drinking water.  third week- ordered beer, was brought the wrong size, ordered large, received small.  by the time the server came back out to check on us...15 minutes later, half my beer was gone.  when I mentioned it, she was confused. I asked to either make sure it was right on the check or bring me a 20 oz beer.  she was confused. ordered appetizers, received them at the same time as the meal. ordered burgers, I asked mine to be cooked Medium. was told on Burger night, they don't cook burgers to temperature.  which I realized from previous visits.  My question was why does it take 30 minutes to get food, if you aren't cooking to them to temperature.  more confusion.  fourth and FINAL week- sat and waited on a server, we received water and ordered beer.  by this visit its a game.  we timed everytime we ordered or had a request.  ordered appetizers, again.  waited 37 minutes to even get checked on.  no appetizer, my beer glass was empty.  ordered another beer canceled appetizer (we already knew it would come out with meal) waited 14 more minutes received another beer, meal and appetizer.  was told we wouldn't get charged for the appetizer because it took so long. received meal no ketchup, or extra sauce that was ordered when the meal order was placed.  18 minutes later here comes the ketchup and extra sauces and another meal and appetizer.  they brought us the exact meal and appetizer out.  when I mentioned it to the server. she said they must have accidentally duplicated the order.  this last thing was petty, but after the bad experiences previous.  it was the last straw.  I gave Bar Louie plenty of opportunities to get it right, but they failed  I will not go back or recommend it to anyone. its convenient, a nice outside seating, mediocre food and the WORSE servers I have ever experienced.  get it together Bar Louie, there are other places to go to in University for Happy Hour food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Went out with a few friends last night, they recommended bar Louie's, it was my first time there. Service was wonderful and the food was delicious. The server was friendly and keep our drink cups full."}
{"text":"Nice place during the weekdays, decent food. I recommend the buffalo chicken there. I heard about the domestic Wednesday beer night for $1, but never try it!"}
{"text":"I walked in expecting great service as usual. Usually the rule is \"seat yourself\". We sat ourselves and got kicked out of the booth and told there is a wait. So we added our name to the list and waited 2 hours squished together at the bar. After waiting, we looked around and saw 3 open tables. We asked why we weren't being seated and we were told to seat ourselves. So once we did, the same waiter came up asking for our order and told us we needed to cancel our tab at the bar and start it with him... so he could get his tip. What a joke!!!!! And then after complaining he came back and introduced himself as a manager.  The drinks were good though. Try the Effen good martini."}
{"text":"Do not go here. The service was terrible.  We were a party of seven on a Sunday afternoon with no one in the restaurant. We waited over an hour and a half for our food, the plates were hot which only means they were sitting under the hot lamp because the guacamole and sour cream were also hot.   The waiter also got the check wrong.  Save time and money and go across the street to Brio or B spot. We will not be back"}
{"text":"Terrible service, we waited 50 minutes for food and the restaurant was only half full!"}
{"text":"Did they all avoid me because I looked insane making googly-eyes and grinning too widely at everyone who walked by trying to get their attention?  Maybe.  Arrived at 8:30pm on a Tuesday night and saw a large chalkboard sign that said \"Please seat yourself\" so we sat outside at a table near the fireplace.  The menus are already on the table for guests since it is self-seating-awesome!  Quick decisions!  There were 5-6 tables being served outside plus a table full of Bar Louie Staff having drinks either after work or for a small holiday party.  The manager came by the staff's table frequently to talk.  I smiled and made eye contact with the various servers working the tables around us, the manager at the staff table, the staff at the table and the bussers.  Everyone was wearing Bar Louie shirts, nametags, etc. so it was easy to see who worked there.  For a minute we thought we had to order at the bar but the other tables outside all had servers when we arrived and continued to be served so that wasn't it...It wasn't busy...It didn't close soon...  One server helping the table next to ours looked as if she was going to come to our table but then she grabbed a box full of silverware to place on some tables that had been bussed.  The manager started to walk towards our table and called the busser over too.  He quickly said something to the busser about the fireplace, pointed, and walked back to the staff party table.  I don't know what he was saying, but those delegation skills combined with that solid index finger pointing motion made me even hungrier.  We weren't in a rush, just hungry and wanted to grab something to eat nearby since we had to stop by Target.  At this point we had been sitting at the table for at least 20 minutes.  I was \"hangry,\" had worked a 15 hour day at the hospital and just wanted to relax and drink a few giant martinis+ eat a burger to self-medicate the stress away...  It's so hard for me to give a 1 star review.  Once I gave a 3-star review and then I gave myself a guilt-trip so severe my mother would be proud....  I went to their website to email the experience to the owner(s) of the franchise (so it wasn't a posted review for others to see) but the website only allows you to contact them by choosing the restaurant."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour and had good service.  The food was very average, and would compel me to order neither the thai Flatbread Pizza nor the meatballs again.  The meatballs had an unusual spice in them that reminded me of a new pool toy smell, and the Flatbread was just ok.  My wine had been oxidizing for at least a day without being preserved properly, but it wasn't terrible.  Overall, I think there's better value to be found nearby"}
{"text":"Recently a few friends and I decided to try Bar Louie out for dinner.  They had live music which was pretty cool, however the food was disappointing. I ordered the fish and chips that arrived at the table on a huge plate.  Sitting on top of a mountain of french fries, big enough for a table of five to share, was three tiny fish sticks.  I was so let down looking at the plate.  The fish was mostly breading and contained little meat.  When you see \"Large Plates\" on Bar Louie's menu and you order the fish and chips be prepared for a large plate of french fries."}
{"text":"I had brooke, she was awesome.... She created a cocktail called the Central Park... U have to try it amazing :).  Good was so good salmon. Cooked perfectly"}
{"text":"Yea Marissa was a cool bartender I guess. But really she made good drinks and suggested great food. Happy customer."}
{"text":"Went for an impromptu lunch and found a nice surprise in Bar Louie.  The atmosphere was classier than most with plenty of TV's to sneak a peek at the game!  Food, while a bit more expensive, was especially tasty.  Our burgers were cooked to order without flaw. We will be back!"}
{"text":"On Friday, a few of us went over to Bar Louie for a HH Holiday thing and ended up loving the place.  The food was great and the service was awesome, especially MJ and Ryan!  We will definitely be going back there.  After awhile you get sick of going to the same places, like BM, Yardhouse and Grape.  Glad we finally checked out Bar Louie."}
{"text":"This  and Nauti Mermaid have to be amongst the worst customer serviced Restaurant downtown Cleveland.  They do have some few exceptional servers (1 or 2) however it seems their employees are under qualified  to understand what customer service means and entails.       The Bartenders come off as bitter and angry and are just waiting to be tipped. Skip this place if you can. The level of un professionalism is abysmal."}
{"text":"Ive been to Bar Louise in Columbus & Westlake & had great service. Well, I've been here twice in 2 weeks since they opened. The service level has not gotten any better. I understand challenges when opening a new business,  but this was ridiculous.  We asked to have the outdoor heater turned on while we waited, the girl did she would tell a Mgr, no one ever did turn it on. We were told 1/2 hr wait,  it was an hour. We  waited 1 1/2 hrs for our food. Our friends never received theirs,  ended up talking to mgr. He comped their bill, but what a horrible experience. While we waited, we noticed very few tables being cleared.  It took one girl 20 minutes to clean one single table! Another guy was just wandering around. Our food was just average. Beers were over priced. I was really looking forward to having someplace new to go to. Sorry to say I won't go back. We'll go back to Houlihans next door. Much better service, better prices & better food."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with a friend on Tuesday night which was $1 burger night and had the turkey burger and a beer w/ fries and my friend had the veggie burger and a blue moon. We both were happy with the food just beware that the toppings add up the price of your burger quick! Our waiter was excellent and attentive and the place wasn't super loud where we couldn't talk. Overall it was a enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"As we had done in previous years following a Steelers game, we came to this place as it was conveniently located from our hotel, the Sheraton Station Square. The eight of us sat in a booth that had a few dishes remaining from the previous customers. Around 15 minutes passed without anyone greeting us for service or removing the dishes. Finally a young girl came to take our order. She apologized and cleaned off our table.  We ordered and then waited at least 30 minutes. A girl from our group went to question what was going on. Eventually the manager came out, apologized and said the food would be out in 3 minutes. At least 10 minutes passed. We questioned him again this time verbally expressing our irritation. He mentioned he fired 4 workers and took the blame. Regardless, we were all disgruntled.  Then several minutes later the waitress came out and said she did not have any avocado and another ingredient and a few of our dishes could not be made. This was something they could have told us before we ordered and had to wait 40 or so minutes. One of the dishes that was supposed to have bacon came with baco bits instead.   The manager agreed to not bill us for the few items we received and with that we got up and left.  While I do give credit to the manager and particularly to the young girl who was apologetic and did her best despite the circumstances, I find this kind of service unacceptable. This place is clearly mismanaged and this level of service has convinced me to never ever come to this bar again.  In order for this or any establishment to retain customers, it is important that they are fully prepared to service customers and if they are not then they at least communicate that to us early on so that our time is not wasted."}
{"text":"Tuesday are the day to get burgers. If you love burgers come here. They are only $5 for any burger on their menu."}
{"text":"$5 burger was simply delicious. It gets pretty crowded I guess during happy hour Tuesdays, but it's worth the price."}
{"text":"Good view good margaritas and bloody Marys. Went downhill fast, service and food below average.  Unfortunately I can't recommend."}
{"text":"We put our names in at 6pm. They said it would be 45 mins. No problem since it was busy and the wait was the same everywhere. 7pm rolls around and no table yet. We see people just walk up and sit at the patio so we go in to ask about our table. We walk up and are informed that it's open seating. So they forgot about the guest list they made us sign. They seat us at a table that had not been cleaned yet. Literally still had dishes and glasses on it. 10 mins for our waitress to come greet us. 20 more mins to get a salad appetizer. Another 25 mins to get our food. Almost 2 hours to get average bar food. Was not impressed at the food nor the customer service. On top of it all, this was my birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! I'm a fan of the Smores martini! And their wings and nachos are bomb!  Great thing is the kitchen is open late, so you can catch a movie at Harkins and still get some great food and drinks after the movie. Definitely returning VERY soon!"}
{"text":"Great patio area. Good service. Usually not too overly crowded. Good looking bar area inside. Good for lunch meetings or happy hour after work."}
{"text":"The food was ok. We ordered the pot pie soup but instead were given the tortilla. We didn't mind too much but the soup was way too spicy for me, and I usually like spicy food. I ordered the chicken sandwich and it was decent. Nothing to rave about. It was just ordinary. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and bleu cheese flatbread, and I really liked it. I'd suggest ordering that if you come here for a bite to eat. I also tried their Pinot Grigio, but it was in a very dirty glass.  Service was ok as well. It wasn't really busy, but it was steady. When we walked in no one was around the door and there were dirty tables everywhere. So we made our way towards the back and sat down at the only clean table. It seems like the waitresses won't clean the tables until after new customers sit down. After a few minutes, I noticed a table of two that were beside us. They were there before us but they had yet to be taken care of even after we got our drinks and ordered. All in all, this place just needs a bit of organization."}
{"text":"Disgusting food and tried several plates, all sucked. Service was horrible and it wasn't even busy. Nice beer menu if you're a beer drinker."}
{"text":"Terrible service. My friends and I came here before a pirate game and went 50 minutes without a bartender stopping by to ask if we needed another drink or our bill, etc."}
{"text":"Bar Louie has a fun atmosphere and many drinks/ food options to choose from. Service can be iffy- just depends on who you get. I've had great servers to non existent servers before.  The drinks, while there is a variety to choose from, are lacking alcohol :( even the martinis taste more like sugar and artificial flavors. This is annoying because if you're paying $10+ for a martini, you hope to have a certain amount of alcohol. My guess is they free pour, and don't put very much alcohol in their drinks so that you feel the need to keep ordering more- in return they make more of your mula. Ehhhhhhh, not feeling that. There are too many great places to choose from.  Food is okay. For some reason I get the vibe that I can't trust the preparation of my food back in the kitchen. But after 7 martinis (which should only be 3 if there were alcohol in them) I would end up hungry and desperate. Shaaaameeee"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Looks very understaffed. We will not be back. The poor server looked like she had far too many tables. She greeted us very quick, but downhill from there."}
{"text":"Great location and service, bad food.  We stopped by on way from Canada for a quick bite/get to know the city. The location and view was nice.  My wife had a shrimp lettuce wrap, it was way too spicy for her, she likes spicy food but, this one was over the top.  I tried the pulled pork Mac and cheese sandwich, well, it wasn't good either. We'll give it a seven try, hopefully the food is better, to our taste."}
{"text":"No one greets you at the door, tables are wobbly, drinks are watered down and service is lacking. Too many other great options around, don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"The service was not bad it was a slow night so we were helped pretty quickly. The price was a little for the quality of food. The food is where this place went horribly wrong. The beer cheese for the pub pretzels was like eating a liquefied onion and the pretzel was blain and soft. The burger was also blain and not cooked to my liking. The tots were crispy but is comparable to eating a fresh uncooked patato. Overall I'm glad i used a gift card for this meal. The idea of this establishment making money off me is vomit inducing."}
{"text":"I arrived in Cleveland late on Saturday and stopped at Bar Louie since it was still open  Since it was after midnight I asked if I could still put in an order. They quickly said yes   Food was really awesome . I had the Thai chicken flatbread and potstickers. Both were excellent   There was depth of flavor for both. Very generous portions.....enough for me to take back to my hotel room   I definitely recommend Bar Louie in Lyndhurst OH.  I am sure the other locations are just as good  Thanks again Dave and Lex for making this traveler happy   Rock on"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place before the Queen concert. Since it's in Westgate and directly across from the arena where the show was, they had an \"event menu\" which also coincided with happy hour. This menu was a scaled down version of the full one, which they were displaying outside for passers by to peruse.  Seated ourselves, as the hostess said it was open seating. I noticed it was happy hour, which included select appetizers, so I asked our server about which items were included in the happy hour and she said they all were since it was an event menu. We ordered based on what she said and the food was rather good. Two different flavors of traditional wings (buffalo and asian), lettuce wraps, a hummus plate, a cheese quesadilla, and a couple side salads, along with drinks.   When our server brought the bill, I looked over it and realized only one food item was marked down for happy hour. I asked our server about it, she went and checked, and returned saying only the quesadilla, boneless wings, and one other thing were included in the happy hour. I was surprised by this and questioned her, but all she said was \"I'm sorry\".   She made no effort to compensate for her complete lack of knowledge of the menu at all. Had we known about the very limited selection, we would have ordered completely differently. I would have liked to speak to a manager, but due to time constraints we just paid the bill and left.   The food was good, the atmosphere was solid, but the service left much to be desired, and that's what lead me to give this place 3 stars. Will I return? Possibly, now that I know the hyper limited happy hour menu, but there are many other restaurant options in the same area, so we'll see."}
{"text":"The more I come here, the more I like it.   Most prior visits (all happy hour) suffered pretty bad service... Wrong drinks, problems with the bill, absent servers.   Not anymore!  I visited for the first time in probably 6 months and I was shocked with the turn-around!  Our server was ON THE BALL. We had a group of folks on the patio, and I never found myself waiting for anything. An extra side of ranch for my half priced boneless wings (boneless bbq  were awesome, a pal had traditional and didn't love them) seemed to appear 20 seconds after I made the request.   We had a cake for a birthday and they let us borrow a giant knife for cutting as well as happily providing plates and utensils. Sure, every place does this, but sometimes with a touch of reluctance.   The happy hour special is great - lots of the top appetizers are half off, all martinis are just over $5, and they have beer and wine specials as well.   I love the large patio, however this sun worshiper wishes they had less umbrellas (but I'm probably in the minority)."}
{"text":"We had meatball & pot sticker apps and berry mojito and watermelon margarita! All were good! Meatballs were spicy so beware! And the berry mojito has blackberries in it so expect seeds. I dont like seeds but I didn't think about that!! The margarita could have more watermelon flavor and it was more of a watermelon limeade! I still thought the drinks were good! Friendly service. My only complaint was the bartender never wiped up the bar when we sat down and it was a salty mess all over! I had to wipe it myself!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for a drink here while I waited for a friend to finish up a meeting after work. I got a martini out on the patio and enjoyed the beautiful Cleveland sunshine. The bartender was nice, and the outside area was nice as well. The martini I got was good. It was nothing spectacular but not bad either - just an average martini. And there were a lot of bees flying around the bar/fruit in the bar for the drinks, so that kinda stunk. Overall, it was an average experience - nothing bad but nothing to write home about either. I will definitely be back - Bar Louie is a staple in Cleveland."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried to eat here, but we couldn't get the staff's attention.  We entered through the main entrance, saw the \"seat yourself\" signs, and sat ourselves outside.  We're both easy going so this is fine.  We looked through the menus, decided what we wanted, chose our drinks, and tried to make eye contact with the staff.    The last straw was when, after 15-20 minutes of sitting there without any acknowledgement, the manager came by and looked at us, instructed the busser to do something with the fireplace near our table, turned on his heel, and went back to hanging out with his employees.  We were looking for some sort of hint that he would send someone over, but we did not get it.  The worst restaurant service experience I had in Paris was better than this.  I wasn't even mangling the language and we felt like personae non gratae.  We ate at Lucille's Barbeque around the corner instead, which was great."}
{"text":"Sat at bar on Sunday afternoon. About 7 people at bar, maybe 10 more at tables. Was served drink immediately, then ignored by the 4 servers for about 20 min. Finally flagged one down to order an app. I thought servers might initiate contact to sell menu items. I guess that is not the business model of the franchise"}
{"text":"Went to Bar Louie with some relatives for lunch on Saturday.  I'd eaten at Bar Louie's before, so I knew what to expect from the food (not horrible, but typically subpar chain restaurant food).  My biggest bone to pick with this visit was the service.  We were literally the only table in the whole place, and yet the waitress made several mistakes.  I asked for a lemon with my iced tea that she never brought, I ordered a cup of soup and she brought a bowl, and she specifically asked me if I'd like it first or with the meal, and she did the opposite of what I'd said.  The other thing that is a huge personal pet peeve of mine is when restaurants list specific ingredients for a dish on the menu and then just leave them out and expect you not to notice.  The salad I ordered said it was made with spinach, and it came out with lettuce.  My sister's flatbread was also missing one of the ingredients listed in the description.  The only reason I didn't give them one star is because the 4 people at the table who ordered burgers did seem pretty pleased with them.    Bottom line is that if you're hungry and downtown, Bar Louie is probably the worst possible choice."}
{"text":"I am glad to see Westgate getting more and more dining options. I have been to Bar Louie several times in the last few weeks and I am happy to see the service has improved greatly since my last visit during the summer. It is quickly becoming my go to place to dine at Westgate.  The last few times I was there it was incredibly busy. Our server Kellie did an outstanding job keeping up despite having several large tables to manage. She was always popping up at the table like a dedicated stalker haha. I say that in a good way. She can hold her own in a conversation as well.   I am a sucker for the loaded tots I almost always open with those. My alternative is the Nachos Libra. For an entree you can't go wrong with baked mac and cheese.  Tater tots and Mac and cheese. That is comfort food.   I am on a sobriety kick right now so was happy to see several mock tail options. I always feel ackward drinking water when my company is enjoying alcohol. A mock tail is appreciated!   One final plus this place serves a full menu to close!"}
{"text":"Great martinis. The appetizers were surprising good. Try the pretzels. Service was good. We go there at least once a month. Great live bands. Jazzy and or blues. Good times."}
{"text":"We went to Bar Louie on Saturday afternoon, March 24, 2018 and had a great meal. I am wondering why this location has such a low Yelp rating.??? The place was not busy on Saturday because nothing was really going on in town. We sat ourselves, which is customary I suppose when they're not busy, and not a problem at all. We were my daughter, her boyfriend and me. We ordered apps (chicken lettuce wraps and the hummus platter) which I thought were very good! For lunch, my daughter went off-menu and got a macaroni and cheese with chicken SANDWICH! She loved it! Her boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich platter and he really liked it. I got the blackened cod tacos which came with rice, black beans, pico, guac and the BEST verde sauce I've ever had. I even asked the waitress to let the kitchen know I said that and she did. The kitchen manager came out to chat and thank us for the compliment.  I don't know what some people's problems are with this place but we had a great meal during an off time and still got fresh, house-made food! We will definitely be back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Avoid sitting on the patio if you prefer to enjoy your food without cigarette smoke and ash. Smokers have ruined the experience on both occasions.   Service is decent, food would taste better without the cigarette ash."}
{"text":"Food is great, bartender on 8/29 around 5pm was a complete b*$!&, happy hour is pretty decent, been wanting to check out this place for awhile now and it seems like a decent place for happy hour if their bartender would just smile once or at least not have an attitude ?"}
{"text":"Average Food with Happy Hour Specials.  Service is above average  Food is always sup-par."}
{"text":"Bar Louie, I wanted to love you. You got a great makeover in bright colors and fun design, the bar is well designed with nice TVs, the patio is large, and you appear to have a great happy hour.  But you sucked. We ate dinner early on a Sunday night. We sat at the bar. There were about 8 other tables occupied. We had surly bar service. I got a filthy wine glass (and the waitress forgot my order--look, if you want to look cool and not write it down, that's fine, but you can't FORGET it). It took 35 minutes for a burger and a sandwich. The surly waitress half-apologized, if \"it's the cook's first day back\" is an apology. We thought the quality of food was atrocious for the price. The highlight was my burger--it was small, overcooked and under-seasoned, but the buffalo sauce with bleu cheese was delicious together. I subbed steamed broc for fries. They were hard and not seasoned. Hubby's steak sandwich was a sad little thing, mostly bread.  Having said all that, if you just want to get in and out for some fun drinks, this place might be great. It has a lively atmosphere at prime drinking hours. It's great for a drink before or after the movies, but even Cadillac Ranch has better food. Sad."}
{"text":"I live close by and always have a pleasant experience when I stop in. Especially, when Kayla is behind the bar. No matter how busy they are she somehow manages to keep everyone happy. A huge pet peeve of mine is when a bartender seems to focus on just a few individuals. Kayla is constantly scanning the bar to make sure everyone has anything they need and always does it with a smile. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Not as bad as some of the others make it out to be. Maybe I had a more competent server, or was just there on a \"good night.\" It helped that we had a table saved (high top of about 10 seats in the bar area) and that I was being treated to a night out by our company owners. The food was nothing great -- just ok. The chop chop salad had an overly \"lettuce-in-a-bag-that's-been-open-for-a-day\" taste. The veggie flatbread was ok, as was the cheese quesadilla (spicy cheese though).   Like I said, not awful, but I might have felt differently had I been paying, as some stuff seemed way overpriced."}
{"text":"Stopped in late night with some friends specifically for the Turkey Burger and some beers. We had a new server who attend us. Our server forgot to put my order in so my food took longer to come out than my other friends. When it did come out my friend and I who ordered the same thing we're disappointed with the quality of the burger. We had it in the past at the downtown location and it was very good and meaty almost like a hand made patty. This patty was like a JeannieO pre cooked patty. Very disappointed for what we paid. When my other friends food came which came out 15 min after our food. His fish sandwich had mayo on it which he requested NOT be put on. He took a few bites and sent it back. They also ordered a cup of soup which came out promptly but was cold. Poor service from our server (why she didn't write our order down for accuracy's sake is beyond me). Poor food quality from the kitchen. We spoke to the manger paid our bill and will NEVER be back. There are much better options in the area."}
{"text":"Was so excited to give this place a try at lunch and I have to say that it was not a pleasant visit.  Sat at the bar thinking I'd get faster service... Wrong. Waited for a while just to get Iced Tea and then asked twice for sweetener.... Never got it.  The restaurant was maybe 15% full however, it took almost 25 min. to get my burger which was ok at best. Ordered side salad and got a watered down version of blue cheese dressing.  I looked all around for salt & pepper and didn't even bother to ask her since I never got the sweetener for my tea.  Here's my advice to all bars and restaurants: If your people aren't competent enough to make sure you get what you need, then it should already BE ON the Tables!! There are so many other restaurants in the area so I won't be going back here any time soon."}
{"text":"Had a very upsetting visit to Bar Louie station square.  The service was very slow and the place was not at all busy.  If the place isn't busy I'm not sure why it would take so long to be greeted and for drinks.  It took 30 minutes to get nachos and when the food arrived it was cold.  The nachos are then sent back and return 20 minutes later and still cold.  I don't think it should ever take 50 minutes to get nachos and if so it should've been served the right way."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Loved Bar Louie in Chicago but nothing is good when the bartenders are this rude. I get that I'm female & we typically have better luck with males but they were beyond rude & twice I caught them making fun of other customers. Too bad. It's a great space & location. Takeout is horrendous. They give you half the size of a meal."}
{"text":"Came back with a big group and I'm happy to say that they seem to have gotten the service back on track. Salmon sliders were still good as were the pretzel sticks appetizers. Everyone enjoyed their food and our waitress was great! Still not five star food in my opinion, but I know that this place seems to be an option again for a meal before a movie."}
{"text":"Something is seriously wrong - 7 friends. Lots of drinks apps and meals. Asked for the check at 9. It's 10:46pm. We've been given every nonsense excuse under the moon. This is complete and total lack of respect for your patrons. Not coming back here ever. Mood changed from happy and celebratory to completely and totally annoyed. Several other tables also upset and they just don't seem to know how to handle themselves.  Even after speaking to the manager who was full of excuses we didn't wrap up until after 11 pm. When you walk in you seat yourself but here are no signs to indicate. A couple came in sat down and got up three times all at dirty tables before finally leaving all while we were waiting. This is a management problem not an employee problem."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good fried chicken sandwich (with decent tater tots) and great Happy Hour beverage prices on a Wednesday night including $3.25 drafts, some domestics were $1.   Considering it was a 70+ degree day in March, they were slammed and severely understaffed. No one was bussing tables except the waitresses, and they weren't very attentive to tables, which led to some angry customers around us.  Still a worthwhile Happy Hour to check out:"}
{"text":"I was so excited about trying this place upon my return to Cleveland. I called and ordered a BBQ salad w/chicken for pick up on Wednesday and it was great. It took an extra 15 mins but whatever. I called again tonight for some food after work and ordered the EXACT same thing. I'm not even home yet but I noticed the bag was considerably lighter than my first order, so I stopped to look. I got a noticeably smaller salad with wilted greens and WAY less chicken. for $14!? I am NOT happy. The two stars are for John the bartender. On both occasions, his customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"I usually do not review chain restaurants, but since I'm a regular I thought I'd help my fellow yelpers get in the know.   Dubbed 'The Lou' by my crew (I'm such a dork). It is quite the hot spot for young professionals to get their network on.   Drink wise, I always order the bud light lime (bottle) or the lienenkugel summer shandy (draft) so I won't comment on their weak martini's.  I'm only going to list the good food. Anything not listed is going to probably disappoint you or downright disgust you (any fish or seafood, which smells and tastes rancid). Go for the spicy italian beef flat bread, which I always order with light jalapenos. Its light, spicy, and my favorite menu item. Second, the chicken taco's. They are yummy, not too heavy, served with rice and beans, and make me very happy. I do like the wonton appetizer, was surprised that they were good. Salads are fine, but I rarely order one. And that is all.  I go for the service, since they know me here I always get great, friendly and prompt service. Also, the scenery. Very nice and large patio with tons of cool people everywhere. Good times, cheers!"}
{"text":"Popped in here for dinner with co-workers on a Tuesday which happens to be half-priced burger day. While the vibe is modern and upbeat, the food and service were sub-par. However, thanks to happy hour appetizer specials (and most of us ordering burgers), our tab was extremely reasonable! There seemed to be confusion among the staff as to who was taking care of our table which became awkward when the two candidates didn't seem to get along. The calamari was rubbery, drink refills sometimes slow, and a few special order instructions missed.   All in all: Great values can be found, but keep your expectations low. I left feeling embarrassed we didn't take our out-of-town guests somewhere with better food and service when there are so many great restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here for lunch today (Saturday). It had a fairly open layout with the bar in the center and fairly limited seating inside with a nice little patio outside. The decor was pretty typical for this type of place.  The food was very good. I had the grilled chicken sandwich. There was an ample amount of juicy chicken and the hoagie had a nice flaky texture on the outside. My wife had the buffalo wings, which she said were good but a bit on the hot side. I really enjoyed my french fries, which had some tasty seasoning. I thought I could taste a hint of lime - different but good. My wife had the tator tots. These were the BEST tots I've ever had! They had the same seasoning as the fries with a perfectly thin, crispy exterior.  The only real negative are the prices, which were a little high for this type of food. We would still eat there again though. I'd like to try the BBQ pulled pork next time."}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday night following a movie at loews.  We sat at the bar and watched the olympics on their  multiple large flatscreen tvs.   Ordered the calamari and shrimp quesadillas.   The calamari was crisp and plentiful the quesadilla however missed the mark.   It wasnt crispy and it tasty sauscy instead of gooey.   The menu is large and reminds me of epcot with all the different ethnicities represented.   gordan Ramsey would probably comment on the lack of focus at first sight.   Miller Lites are $4 a pop which was a big downer as i got my $85 bill for two apps and multiple miller lites.    Great atmosphere and probably a fine place to watch the pens game. Food looks like its hit or miss  All in all would rather drive down the road to the south side for a post movie food grub and tottie."}
{"text":"We went there a few weeks ago to have a later dinner and watch the Cavs on one of their many TV's around the bar. Before we sat down we asked if they would have the Cavs game on. Waitress said yes it would be on. We got our food...still no game ...and the food was just okay at best. Tasted like GFS heated up/fried stuff.   The really bad part was they wouldn't turn on the Cav's game for us. They kept lying to us and saying the manager was going to turn it on. We asked multiple times!! More lying from some d-bag with a doorag on his head saying it was going to be turned on. We ended up pulling the game up on a phone to watch. Finished out food and told the waitress how sad it was we had to beg to have a World Champion Cavs game turned on the TV. You'd think for this town only having one championship team in so long a stupid place like Bar Louie would have some damn sense and have the game on and not lie to customers about turning on the game. I guess Bar Louie is based outside of Cleve doesn't like the World Champion Cavs!!!! Sad!!!! Won't be back. They are more into the show 60 minutes with closed captions than Lebron and THE WORLD CHAMPION CAVS!!!!!  UN-freaking real. Major fail Bar Louie!!!!"}
{"text":"Marissa was a fantastic bartender. She really knows her menu and suggested the bbq pulled pork which was delicious. Upgrade to the queso and loaded tots. They are worth it. Plenty of beer to choose from."}
{"text":"Not too shabby.  A nice getaway from the flashy lights of the Vegas Strip.  They had an ok selection of drafts (I drank Bass) and it was a place I could actually hold a conversation with my friends without talking loudly like most bars we had been to all week.  Thank goodness there are low key places to hang out at in Vegas! haha"}
{"text":"I've been to bar Louie a few times and always had a good experience, however, yesterday was phenomenal. My friends & I went for dinner on a 75 degree day & wanted to sit somewhere outside. We had a group of 10 & tried to go to southern tier next door, however, the wait was an hour and a half. Bar Louie was able to seat us all outside immediately. Our server was awesome, everyone's meals and checks were correct, and we were all so happy with the food and service we received. It's hard to wait on a group on 10 people and have everyone leave happy campers.  As an appetizer, we had a few orders of the bruschetta and it was DELICIOUS. I highly recommend it. My husband got the street tacos, which were great. They come out on a hot plate similar to fajitas & you build them yourselves. I had the salmon sliders & loved them. The salmon was cooked perfectly. I would have never thought to order the salmon sliders, but our waitress recommended them and they did not disappoint. Whoever thought of putting salmon on a mini bun is a genius. Others at our table ordered burgers, flatbread & a few other items. Everyone would not stop talking about how great their meals were. I'd also like to add that the prices are incredibly affordable.  To wrap things up, if you are in the north shore looking for a great meal, awesome service, and an overall pleasant experience, check it Bar Louie!"}
{"text":"Trisha and Mckenzie are great... Very attentive. Kevin-negative. Great place overall!"}
{"text":"Awesome specials, can't beat $1 burger night along with some other good drink specials other nights of the week.  It's fairly new where Blake's used to be so it's always crowded, but thats the only downside."}
{"text":"We sat for 15-20 minutes with waitresses walking by us numerous times without saying anything to us let alone taking our drink order.  Left and went to Homerun Harry's instead.  Cheaper drinks and better service."}
{"text":"The only thing nice about this place is the view. My bf and I went here on a Saturday night around 6:30 and ordered chips & salsa trio and drinks. The chips & salsa took over 30 minutes to bring to us and the dinner at the table sitting next to us took over 2 hours. The manager had to come over and apologize to them about their wait and said he would cover the cost of their meal. Our waitress completely disappeared after she brought us our drinks and never returned to give us our check. After waiting FOREVER, we finally left money on the table for her because she was no where to be found even after asking another server to find her for us. The chips came with ketchup tasting salsa, cheese whiz consistency queso, and guacamole that wasn't freshly made. We were definitely dissatisfied with this restaurant and will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. My friend ordered a salad, it was soggy ice burg lettuce. She sent it back and they didn't even fix the mistake! Thank goodness for the bar manager that gave her a free drink. They took the salad off the bill in the end. My food was pretty good. I was happy with the portion size. I got the salmon sliders."}
{"text":"So, my friends wanted to go here for lunch today.  It was new, we had never been before, let's give it a shot, right?  The waitress convinced us to order draft beers because they were on special, so we agreed.  One friend ordered a coke which came immediately.  I watched the frost from my frosty mug fade away as our beers sat at the end of the bar getting warmer.  I saw our waitress walking around by the bar, and assumed that she MUST have seen them.  After what seemed like an eternity, another person brought our beers which only had frost at the very bottom at this point.  OK, well, let's give the food a shot.  One of my friends suggested we order as soon as we saw the waitress again, because they already didn't seem very timely.  Note that it was lunchtime, there were very few tables occupied and at least 8 staff members that I saw.  So, we order.  If you are a fan of my reviews, you know that one of my favorite lunch time treats is Four Peak's Salmon BLT.  So, anytime I see a salmon sandwich, let alone one that includes bacon, I am tempted.  I ordered the Salmon sliders.  The waitress convinced my friends to get the \"loaded tots\" which adds melted cheese, onions, and bacon bits on top of your tots.  I stuck with straight up tots.  Well, in case you couldn't guess, the food took a while.  But I had my semi-cold beer and good conversation with my friends, so I let it slide.    The salmon sliders were not good.  They weren't awful.  I mean, I ate them.  But, I would not choose to eat them again, unless I was in a desperate state of hunger and they were the only thing available.  The bun is hard.  Which of course makes it hard to eat the tiny sandwich.  The \"blackened\" salmon was not blackened at all.  This is what makes the sandwich btw.  The blackening spices take away from the fishiness of the salmon which allow the other flavors (hello, bacon?) to come through.  Because of the lack of seasoning on the salmon, that was all you could taste.  That precious bacon and whatever kind of aioli they used was wasted.  The tots were tots.  Nothing special.    Beware yelpers, beware."}
{"text":"I will never patronize another Bar Louie ever again. $3.20 for a coke? Seriously??? Not a rum and coke.. but just a coke... simple fountain beverage.  Not even a refill.. just one (1).  I wonder how much a glass of water from the facet would cost??   If they overcharge for 1 coke, what else are they over charging??  To me this is a red flag. .. think about it..  Very disappointing.. never ever again.."}
{"text":"A great place to go after a movie or if you are anywhere near the waterfront! Ask for Brea she is awesome!! I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Eh, this place was okay but it was sort of a weird crowd/overall experience for a Saturday night.  Bobby and I came here after dinner and sat up at the bar. Tip: if you sit behind the taps, no one will bother to acknowledge you exist. When we moved seats, we were finally asked what we would like to drink after waiting for 5+ minutes in our original seats. It wasn't all that busy, either. Most of the people sitting at the bar were a bit older than we were. It seems that Bar Louie is trying too hard to be trendy with the decor/neon blue lighting/extensive martini list. Maybe I'm just salty about the wait."}
{"text":"I love bar Louie but this location is quickly becoming a favorite of mine. I had a blast with a few of my coworkers last weekend. Denise was our server and was extremely sweet. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Service was skeptical. For this to be a sports bar, there was only one bartender!! She was overwhelmed and not socials like at all. The salad with added shrimp was with every penny. The dish was large and plentiful."}
{"text":"Fun place to stop for a drink before or after walking around Crocker doing some shopping or seeing a movie at the theater right next to it. The bar opens up into a patio and makes for some excellent people watching.  They have a decent happy hour which gets you $3.25 drafts, $4.25 wine, and $5.25 martinis. They also have select apps and flatbreads at half off during this time. The real deal though is to come in on Wednesdays and they have $1 bottled domestics all night! Also, Tuesday is $1 burger night. Great specials. The food was enjoyable as well. Ordered the calamari. Bring some friends and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Horrible service  I brought 5 guests to this establishment on January 2, 2015. My friend wanted to order a drink that was not listed on the menu. The waitress stated that the drink could not be made nor did she understand how to ring it up. So my friend ordered another drink on the menu. One of my other friends asked the bartender if he knew how to make this drink and he said yes. So then we told the waitress we wanted the other two drinks. She said it's too late and we asked to speak with the manager. He rudely states the drink was made and did not offer to make the other drinks. Both the waitress and the manager had a careless attitude as the waitress slammed our drinks on the table.  Please make sure bar Louie hires competent staff member that know how to make customers have a pleasant experience. Would I return? Maybe if a new manager is on duty and a waitress that tries to accommodate the customer. This is a nice establishment with lots of potential."}
{"text":"Well,  what can I say that's good about this place?  Not much. Poor service,  music is pumped way too loud, and the menu is a half-assed attempt at an upscale TGI Friday's.   They used stale day old garlic bread to make my turkey &  brie sandwich and the French fries were cold and stale on arrival.   Also, using a sliced baguette and then turned upside down as a way to make and present a sandwich does not make you special.  It's pretentious and douchey."}
{"text":"I've never really had any decent experiences at Bar Louie. We came just because we had a coupon for a free appetizer & it was late, so we chose to eat here. It was a Wednesday night around 9 PM, and there were probably 4 other parties in the whole place. We seated ourselves and about 1 minuet later our waiter came over & asked for our drinks. He brought our waters and there was lipstick on my glass. After telling him, he promptly brought another glass. We ordered our food and waited maybe 15 minutes for the food to arrive.  I ordered the Shrimp Margherita flatbread and my boyfriend got the buffalo wings. The flatbread was great! Just enough tomatoes, oil, and dressing. The only thing I would suggest would be to add more shrimp.  His wings were very VERY crispy. Like no meat, all crisp. I'm one who typically prefers crispier wings but these were way too overdone. They had a good amount of buffalo sauce on them though. If we were actually paying for these wings, we would've sent them back. But since they were free, we decided to stay quiet."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here because the food looked good and so did the drinks. However we walked in and all the servers were standing near the bar (not working) and did not even acknowledge us. I was on my way walking over to them to ask what was going on and he yelled over to me to \"sit wherever you want\". My mom and I then sat ourselves at a booth. Our server, J****n, walked over and smelled like marijuana. I don't care what you do in your personal life but I didn't come to dinner to smell some weed while trying to eat. I asked about the drink menu and he told me the mojitos were going to be $10 and that there are no happy hour specials on drinks (keep in mind it's 5:16pm). We left and went somewhere else. Don't even bother coming here unless you're already drunk and don't care about attentiveness or service."}
{"text":"Don't get some of these reviews ..... almost seems like a few people/ yelpers  have it out for someone there !  Because we love this place ... go often and really enjoy the drinks , food and service .... the restaurant itself is spotless ---bathrooms ( at least mens room ) are super clean .... one employee there who really stands out in my mind is Alissa ..... very attentive and provides great hospitality/ service ..... you'll like this place .... we sure do  !"}
{"text":"Bar Louie is Bar Louie no matter where you go.  I used to frequent Bar Louie at Chinatown in Washington, DC for happy hour.  It was a nice spot, nice vibe.  Bar Louie in Tempe, ummmm it's ok.  It's not as fun, even during happy hour.  I'm not sure why but it's just a blah bar which is why my review is pretty blah ... this was a hard one.  I don't hate it, definitely don't love it.  That's about it!"}
{"text":"Went to Bar Louie yesterday with my girls. Was there from 6:30 pm until 10:45 pm. Was cut off after three beers which four of my friends had all because the waitress didn't feel comfortable serving them drinks. I had sangria that was filled with more ice than the drink itself. This was all after three gigantic chicken nachos, pot stickers, 12 waters, and not to mention the 15-20 minutes it took for her to bring the alcoholic drinks. We got there early to catch up and talk spent four hours there only because our food and drinks took forever. Went to this place because Salt gave me and the others food poisoning the last time but service and attitude from Cara was not worth it. Suspiciously we were cut off once they started to pick up business. Never going back there again due to terrible customer service and the wait time for food."}
{"text":"This location is very different from the few others I have been to. It has a very mild local bar vibe to it which is why I come back. The happy hour specials are great (best in the area) and the food never disappoints. On a Friday evening you may encounter a bit of a wait, but the bar staff is awesome. My husband and I love Mar and Mel! They are always an entertaining pleasure. You will be sure to have a great evening any time you stop in."}
{"text":"We left a late movie and we're looking for somewhere that was still open and Bar Louie came to the rescue. The music late at night was really good and the bar food was pretty decent. Our server was sweet and it was a good time. Bathrooms weren't as clean as I would've liked but overall it was a nice time."}
{"text":"Me and a friend went for drinks and unexpectedly it was late night happy hour. From 10-close I believe.  The service and the appetizers were mediocre. The martinis are where it's at"}
{"text":"Bar Louie continues to miss the mark whether it be Orlando, Raleigh, Charlotte, etc. I am partially at fault for giving another at-bat to this establishment. For example, asked for chicken Louie, received turkey Louie; purchased broccoli on upside charge side and received barely cooked broccoli. Bartender presented with minimal sincerity and appreciation. All of these shortcomings can be attributed to managerial oversight, Monday night hangover blues (patrons were minimal), etc. Other nearby eateries within walking distance of Charlotte University Hilton may be better selections."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Even though it was busy, our waitress was on point with everything and came by often. We also had the manager and 2 other staff members check up on us as well. For my drinks, I had Berry Mojito and The Clover Martini. They were both very good but for the berry mojito, you can barely taste the alcohol and had way too much ice. As for my meal, I had grilled veggie wrap, which surprisingly had a lot of flavor and was delicious!"}
{"text":"Too bad I can't comment on the food, but I will say the service was so bad that we had to leave. We sat at a table that was still dirty from a previous customer. We saw one of the waitresses come by and start cleaning it, so figured she'd be back to finish. Wrong! We sat for 10 minutes or so and finally I got someone's attention to get us drinks and clean the table. It wasn't her table but she was very nice to help out. She said Austin would be taking our order. Another 10 minutes and no Austin. He walked by at least 5 times, making no eye contact at all. Another waitress came by and said he'd go get him. Still no Austin. Finally had to leave as we had limited to time by that time. Our beer was never delivered in all that time either."}
{"text":"They have some really good happy hour prices & the flat breads are tasty. We've been to this location a handful of times for just drinks at the bar & had really good service. We've also tried to eat at the bar in the past & had horrible service. As in placing a food order, watching people who ordered after us receiving food & the order never showing up in their system. Apparently the bar tender had just left mid shift. This was on a busy Friday at dinner time. The manager on duty came over & apologized & gave us a couple of drink/app comps. So we thought hey one more try on food & we sat at a table on another Friday evening. The server was stretched pretty darn thin as in she was handling the West side patio & inside West side tables. I'd say she had 10+ tables (without a busser). She barely had time to greet let alone do her own refills etc. So that's not her fault at all. She did come by as often as she could but it wasn't enough. The food wasn't good either. We ordered the lettuce wraps which were too wet & sweet. No where did the description read sweet & sour chicken wraps.The lettuce was hot on the edges where it clearly had sat too long under a heat lamp, The burger was really tasty but the fries were bland. So if you want a fun place to hang for happy hour go for it. Sit at the bar & don't order anything other than the flatbread. This location needs to have more dependable staff. This is clearly a training & staffing issue on top of poorly executed dishes. Sadly won't be back for more than a good priced beer & moving on. We really like the location & the atmosphere is on point for fun. Just poorly executed on every level. Sad, sad face."}
{"text":"Tara the bartender was amazing...the kitchen is banging....with the $1 burger on Tuesdays and Stephanie the Mtg is super sweet!"}
{"text":"Tuesday is $5 burger and fries or tots.  Bargain is an understatement.  The burger and tots were excellent, I opted for the BBQ styke.  I really enjoyed the food, and the portions were generous.  Our server was outstanding, very attentive, and always smiling.  Loved her.  I am taking away 1 star as it was too loud for my taste.  The music selection was perfect, but too loud.  Hockey was playing on the TVs, and that is my favorite sport.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went here right after they opened on my birthday and nothing really stood out.  There was lots of hype after this place took over the old Smokey Bones building.  They had a few \"promo days\" with free apps and whatnot. A lot of my peers went.   When I decided to try it out, the food was alright, drinks were alright (pricey), and the waitress was sweet and attentive.   The one thing that made me say \"what the heck\" was when my friend ordered calamari and there were literally five measly strips stuffed into a martini glass. Cute way to rip off customers and make it look like they're actually getting a lot of calamari for the buck.  I would never go out of my way to eat here and have never said \"hmmm I'm craving bar Louie tonight.\" But it's not terrible either."}
{"text":"I moved to the C-town last Friday and I have gone here twice. Once on a Saturday for Lunch and then for the infamous $1 burger day. The first trip was around 2pm on Saturday and I was very happy with the service. As a prior to bedtime story, I was afraid to go here from the reviews but that has never stopped Eric before, said Eric. So we walked over my new flat and we were quickly able to find a seat. It was a large one by the bar. The serve called it the cursed table; I have no idea why but I thought it was a fine table. I am broke because of my new flat and I had some food before coming so I was a weird-o and only got water. My friends though got their Bloody Mary ($10) which was very good and it comes with a lot of extras that made it certainly unique like bacon, pickles, etc on a stick. My roommate got two martini's; a smores martini and a honeydew one with coconut. ($8-10). Of course I sampled all of them. My water was constantly refilled and it was a great social time for me. The both of them got sandwiches that were good in size and they enjoyed immensely.  Next trip was on Tuesday with the same people by chance and my roommates father was in the area and he joined. We sat at the same table and we had again a fantastic server. My friend and I arrived way before my roommate and his father so we got the pretzels and dip. It came with four stick and queso, honey mustard, and cinnamon butter. They were quite good but nothing too much to say about them, it is more or less the staple of my friend to order those. I ordered the same martini as my friend; the smores, which was on the happy hour menu so they were $5.25 and just as good with a rim of graham and chocolate. Then I got the Angry sailor or something like that which was I think $10 and it was good but not my taste. For the burgers, ask for a menu and you get the bun, burger, and lettuce. Everything else is an la carte add on, but it is cheap like $.25 for tomato, onion, etc. and I think cheese was more. All good and the burgers were fantastic. Fries or tots were an add on of ~$3. They were a great serving and tasted absolutely fantastic! The level of busy was about a 6/10 which was manageable and there were noticeable open tables so nothing to deter you from attempting to visit. We had great service, I am sure I will be up there many more weeks so if it goes to hell I can say something. The bathrooms were very nice as well and that is a huge plus. I actually ordered two hamburgers myself and the second was also $1 so that is nice. I think it would be frowned upon though to order 5 for lunch all week but the thought crossed my mind."}
{"text":"We came in around 11pm after having dinner at a local restaurant and I was not pleased at all with the service. I felt like I had to work to get the bartenders attention for a drink. I felt ignored and noticed he would stop and chat with other customers before coming to check on us. At one point one of the bartenders literally threw the bill receipt at my friend and didn't have the courtesy to put the bill in the cup and say here you go. They had no manners at all. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Very mediocre food. We came for happy hour which was okay, we got buffalo wings and calamari (weird combo I know). The calamari was greasy and the wings were chicken chunks with buffalo sauce.  I liked my beer and the lemon drop was good. But overall disappointing. I wouldn't come back here for the food, but the ambiance and service was good."}
{"text":"I came here on a \"first date\" with my girlfriend. It was really our 4th date but we won't go into that. Wanted to try this place since it had changed over from a Irish bar. When we arrived the sign outside said seat yourself. That threw a red flag up for me. Where we going to be noticed? Would we sit at a table for an hour and then finally get some attention after we flagged someone down? The answer is no. Our server Erica came right over and got our drink orders. She also found out that we were headed to a movie and in a little bit of a hurry. Drinks came right out and water was never empty. Of course we were sitting right in front of where they had a water station but still. I got the fish and chips, wanted something kind of different, and the girlfriend got a burger. Both were great and Erica got them right out to us. She really did a great job of getting us in and out in time for our movie. The fish were good sized pieces and nicely battered and fried. There were a ton of fries which were good but I could not finish. Girlfriend said her burger was cooked just right.  Everything was great. Service, the food, the drinks, everything. I really liked how they moved the bar that was along one wall to the middle of the room. It really seemed to open the room up and somehow make more space. I will definitely come back to hang out here before or after a movie. With friends or on another date night with the girlfriend."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the ambiance of this place. The bar area is very large, and there is even some upstairs seating with nice couches and whatnot. A solid beer selection at reasonable prices makes you want to come back! It doesn't generally get very crowded (even on Friday and Saturday nights), so don't expect a South Side type of environment.   All that being said, there is a reason why this is a two-star review. Even though this place doesn't get crowded, it takes a very long time to get served. I have waited up to 30 minutes between rounds while sitting at a relatively empty bar."}
{"text":"OK I get it was busy for a comedy show at the arena but you think being in that area of games and events they knew that.  Our food took 50min, no joke.  We asked our server to check for our apps ONLY after 30 min and her response is what annoyed me the most and hence the review.  She says its really busy and how long was it, oh only 30, should be like 45 min at least.  At 45 min she realized we still didn't have anything and went back and it appeared.  Funny she REFUSED to check before.  Really?  Not to mention first drink was awful, asked for simple syrup to help it.  Then needed to order another, we paid for it, which is fine but not even asked about.  Plus paying the bill took forever and people wanted our seat!  So bad service, bad drinks, food too long.  I'd avoid.  Wish we waited in line at Yard House probably would have took less time and been better."}
{"text":"Decent appetizers but the outside bar staff (especially the dude with the tattoo on his arm) is just, um, well, a dick.  Especially to other guys.  A guy walked up to the bar, asked for the drink list, and the bartender just laughed at him.  Another guy went to place his drink order and the bartender just looked at him and said he'd be with him in a second and turned around and walked away.  Total jackass.  The pretzel sticks are good and it's nice to sit outside but it would be great if they could find a bartender with a bit more of a pleasing personality."}
{"text":"The Pros: Great view of the city and river in good weather...   Lovely for loud large groups Varied menu with some original items Great place to watch a game inside with a huge bar Fun location Good place to take out of towners.  The Cons: The food when I went yesterday was not great.  We got the wrong sandwich, our order wasn't as described because the kitchen was out of \"lots of things\"  (Tell us when we order, not when you deliver the meal without elements on the plate.)   Can be loud--not a place for a romantic date... The bathroom condition was really bad.  The server did comp up an appetizer, and they were friendly enough.. they just failed to wow.   The view was great, and we did enjoy walking around seeing the fountain dance to \"Pour some sugar on me\"  seriously?!?!?  Yes!   Classy eh?"}
{"text":"No Stars! We ordered drinks and food and saw our waiter twice, we were here for two hours. Worst dining experience of my life. The manager gave excuses and was just as lazy as the wait staffStay far away from this place."}
{"text":"Een echte Amerikaanse bar, met grote schermen en live muziek. Ik was er toen Jeordie optrad, een in Phoenix bekende en geliefde zangeres met een prachtige stem. Vriendelijk personeel, lekker eten, groot, ruim en fris. Uitstekend."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and each time the food was tasty and service good. Last night I got the Chicken Madrid Skewers and they were awesome. A seasonal menu item so hurry in and try them! Definitely head in for happy hour when several apps are half off and martinis are $5.25. Otherwise you'll be spending a good amount of cash on just apps and drinks."}
{"text":"Drinks are tasty and refreshing but a bit pricey plan on spending $10 per mixed drink  the food is great love the Luigi (steak sandwich) I didn't have issues with service they excellent with keeping the drinks coming and water filled. Plus there are plenty of TVs to watch sporting events"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Good selection of beer wine and spirits. Came on Tuesday night $1 burger night. Fantastic deal. Baskets of fries or tots are $4.29 to add to the burger. Burger was great. Second visit had the spiked bourbon wings. Wings were great also."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today. When we walked in we wait about 10 minutes before we even saw an employee. Finally the bartender came out and told us to sit ourselves so we did. We waited about 10 minutes before someone came to get our drink order. We then waited about 30 more minutes and I finally asked someone to please take our order since I was on my lunch break. The waiter said he would be right there but never came. We ended up getting up and walking out. Nobody seemed to care that they were losing business. The bad thing...there was ONLY ONE other table sat in the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"On event nights management should ramp up their wait and kitchen staff.  My family and I have been waiting over 70 minutes for our dinner.   Shameful.  Nothing but excuses from management.  \"We're busy.\"   Everything rises and falls upon leadership.  Tonight... this place had none."}
{"text":"(I will update this later if I ever get a chance to eat here) We stopped in here on a whim during the tree lighting in Crocker. I know this can be a crazy time for Crocker and all the restaurants are packed so we expected to wait a little for a table. We walk in and there's a chalk sign that says seat yourself. Well there's no tables except a large 6 (maybe 8) top towards the back. There was a women and her daughter who came in when we did who offered to share the table with us since they were so busy. No problem right? Well after we are seated and settled a server comes over to us and states the table is reserved. There aren't any signs on the table to say this but that's fine we can wait. The lady who was with her daughter asked the server where can we wait for a table then and the server says \"oh, I don't know. I don't think you can\"....sooooo what do you do then but pack up and leave?   Thanks Bar Louie for literally the worst experience yet at a restaurant since apparently we aren't even allowed to wait for a table. (Maybe next time I won't bring my children but bring more adults that will have a larger bar tab and then maybe you'll offer to let us wait for a table)"}
{"text":"Has anyone ever ordered the spinach dip...and actually said they liked it? I doubt it, food is bad. Our table ordered spinach dip, brashetta, pizza and calamari. All pretty much bad and bland. Waitress was great though and did an awesome job of getting us drinks and she was really sweet."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and engaging. Marell is great and takes the time with everyone in the restaurant. Girls behind the bar are great and fun to talk with."}
{"text":"Slow service but great food and friendly folks. Ordered Chicken Street Tacos for lunch and they were incredible. Massive serving of spicy, white meat chicken with all the fixins'. Great healthy choice."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere.  Happy hour prices are reasonable.  The drinks are VERY good!  The place can get pretty busy and they could use a few more servers.  I would go back again.  12/13: service is very, very slow tonight"}
{"text":"We went there on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. The place was dirty, floors weren't swept, bathrooms were not cleaned, trash was not emptied.    This was first and my last visit."}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if possible. Service is extremely slow and unapologetic. The restaurant is not clean. I encountered vomit all over the ladies bathroom on a sunday afternoon, clearly from the night before that still had not been cleaned. There is just no excuse for that. Will never return here, absolutely disgusted."}
{"text":"3 stars overall rating for this place is pretty accurate. Just ok, nothing special. It was surprisingly busier on a Monday night than we had expected. No greeting at the door was a bad first impression. A sign or any kind of acknowledgement from staff to seat ourselves when we walked in would've been nice. Anyways, the half-price apps and sangrias/wines were decent, but our server was bizarre. We asked her to take our pic with my phone and instead of saying \"smile\" she said \"20 percent!!\". I thought at first she was referring to the battery life left on my phone then it dawned on me she was referring to a tip. We left a pretty generous tip in cash on the table and after she took the bill, she asked \"oh is that for me too?\". Tacky."}
{"text":"Strap yourself in,  this is an in depth review because we just left.  Not good, in a kind of shrug your shoulders and sigh kind of way. Walked in,  place was a buzz, cool vibe and nice decor. You seat yourself which I like. Sat down and a bar manager immediately greeted us,  taking our drink order and suggesting a bruscheta appetizer. Seemed like a good start,  I didn't even mind the 20+ dirty drink glasses perched on the bar top facing customers-those should definitely be placed lower our behind the bar-out of sight of they're going to hang out for over 30 minutes. Bruscheta came  out before the drinks,  two other servers had stopped by to get our drink orders because the manager forgot to lay down cocktail napkins,  letting the other servers know we had been helped.  They seemed annoyed by that. The bruscheta was ok,  served in a huge martini glass. Overly salted, would have benefited from the removal of the iceberg and the addition of a basalmic. Husband ordered an old fashioned and I ordered a one of their virgin specialties-the mango drink.  Took 15 minutes to come out,  then,  the server accidently spilled my drink on me- she apologized and even when I returned to the table room a trip to the restroom to clean up,  the server was still waiting for someone to come worth a mop.  They don't seem to have a policy for a cleanup in place because everyone was confused. The cup was left on the table,  and a replacement came out ten minutes later.  I tasted it,  very very bland like a can of mango juice with some lemon lime. His drink was ok,  nothing special. Food came out, his pasta was overly seasoned,  basic sauce. My fried louie was cooked to a crisp and clearly not made in house. Fried egg and bacon were good,  but the underlying grossness of the meat tainted everything,  greasy and a hint of freezer burn. The tots were nice and crisp. I let the server know the burger wasn't good,  she was empathetic, this was clearly not the first time she's heard it-she said she was sorry that this experience was a 'total, epic failure.' She offered to bring me something else but my husband was just about finished and I didn't want to spend more time waiting so I declined. Manager did come over,  I expressed my suggestions about the drink and food- he was well aware, said that he thinks the drinks should be sweeter on the mango and watermelon, but shrugged it off. He did offer a dessert, but again,  I was turned off and declined. I was surprised to see the appetizer comped,  that was a   cool thing to do. Clearly the main issue lies in training and quality control.  Maybe we'll be back, I did see a couple at the bar send back what looked like lemon drops, so it was more than a single drink issue,  I really wanted it to be a good new spot. Please feel free to message me,  and I will be happy to even further elaborate."}
{"text":"I returned to Bar Louie in the University area of Charlotte almost a year after my first disappointing visit.  This time, instead of a workday lunch, I went on a very slow Sunday evening.  In other words, there were customers sprinkled throughout the restaurant, but about 80-90% of the tables were open.  We were promptly greeted by our server and served our drinks.  The disappointing aspect was with how long it took to get our food (AGAIN; see my previous review).  All we ordered was a burger and a chicken sandwich.  And it takes over 30 minutes?  With a restaurant that's barely occupied?  What is with this location?  I've gone to other Bar Louies in different cities when it's been jam-packed and was delivered food promptly.  Why can't this Charlotte location operate properly?  VERY disappointing. The food was excellent, but something seriously needs to be done about the kitchen (and possibly management)."}
{"text":"If i could give 0 stars i would this place is horrible the staff is too damn delicate the bar is named bar louie...so my friends and u went to the bar after a cards game and we just asked why the bar was named bar louie, our bartender then asks his manager what we asked and comes back and tells us we are cut off and we cant order any liquor wtf.... It was just a question and this establishment took it as if we were drunk because we asked this. Ive never felt so disrespected and at a place before ever..straight up stay  away from this place its a joke ."}
{"text":"Love going to Bar Louie. Everything about it is great!! However, today I noticed the women's bathroom needs work, major cleaning, and repairs.  Also, Benedict needs to be more egg quality and less bread. Service outstanding!!! Ty!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Had to wait for a new beer, napkins etc. don't waste youre time. Good beer selection in guess"}
{"text":"Been here 35 minutes and still haven't got our drinks or water. 1 person st our table received an ice tea."}
{"text":"Arrived this Sunday afternoon through the mall entrance. Was asked to head to the front to be seated. When we did saw a large sign saying \"seat yourself\". After sitting was yelled at to wait for hostess, which apparently was not even at work yet (3pm). I don't like being yelled at so I just ignored the bossy lady behind the bar.  Once seated my son and I were both very hungry so ordered immediately. The server was very good; the food was not. Actually my son enjoyed his Mac & Cheese w/Grilled Chicken. I ordered the Blackened Fish Tacos - however they were out. So rather than look at the menu again I ordered the Drunken Fish & Chips. Not so good. Fish was over-battered and burnt. No vinegar to be found and the tartar sauce was, eh. A couple of gross pieces of fish were inside and I was only able to pick at them a bit. Settled on eating the average french fries.   The place was not crowded, but the mall was. The atmosphere is decent and what I expected as I had been to other locations in other cities. A bit over priced for this lunch."}
{"text":"Best place for a late dinner. They have a pretty diverse and interesting  menu. Kitchen is open til 2am. The atmosphere is very relaxing and staff is always pleasant."}
{"text":"AWSOME food, great staff!! Recommend the buffalo flat bread. We had a great evening. Food came out really quick."}
{"text":"I feel like Bar Louie is about as meh as you can get. Everything is good, but nothing special and the service wasn't the worst ever but definitely not good.   We started with drinks on a not at all busy Friday night. They took forever to arrive, but we're good when they showed up (I got the Louie Cosmo because it's one of their specialties).  We skipped appetizers and went right for entrees, which, like the drinks, took forever. I ordered the Sesame Encrusted Ahi Tuna. It was ok, but I've had this dish elsewhere and it was much better there. The tuna was a little over cooked as well.   I feel like Bar Louie is just resting on the fact they they're located in Legacy Village and therefore people will come. My BF who was eating with me is of the opinion that they understaff just because they can, but who knows?  If I were to come back I would sit at the bar and just get drinks and maybe an app, but I don't know that I'll make the decision to go back. I'd more just be tagging along somewhere. :-\"}
{"text":"I know today is a holiday 1-2-17. If you're going to be open then you should be ready to serve people.   Out of pretzels as an appetizer, food coming out real slow, hard to get a refill in my ice tea.  Tables aren't being bussed either.  Looks like only 3 girls working. 1:45 in the afternoon.  I know I wasn't asked how I wanted my burger, but man is it well done over cooked is a better word for it Had the Louie burger, even though over cooked, still not bad. How can anything be bad with cheddar, egg and BACON.   Barmaid not the most friendliest but all things considered not to bad.  Would I come back again, probably not but will try other Bar Louie's"}
{"text":"Tara was the best! Service and food quality well above what one as expecting for a chain restaurant. The staff here really made me feel at home and I will always visit this bar when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Dollar beers on Wednesday Night and Loaded Tater Tots, pretty much two solid reasons to visit.  Matter of fact, they have some sort of special every night of the week wether it be food or drinks or both!  Located across from the movie theater this is a good place to go before or after a flick with your hot date.  I say skip over priced Burgatory and come here on Tuesday for dollar burgers.  Just as good and half the bill."}
{"text":"A group of five of us went to Bar Louie on a weekday for happy hour. We got the spinach artichoke dip, the cheese quesadilla, a chicken flatbread, and some drinks. The food was just alright and the drinks were not much better. Also, being that it was a weekday, it wasn't very busy but the server was not very attentive. We had to flag her down to order refills on drinks & more food. In fact, we probably would've ordered more if she would've come back around to properly take the orders. Considering that there are other restaurants in the area that also offer happy hour deals, we probably won't be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Bar Louie is a chain, but there are two menu items that I love and would prefer to get from here as opposed to other places: their blue cheese and pear salad is THE best salad in the world (albeit not low on calories), and their Bloody Mary is a snack in itself, with a huge stick of bacon, cheese and olives. Delicious! The Crocker Park location tends to get very busy, and they do not carry many local beers, which is why I docked a few points."}
{"text":"Not the waiting staffs fault but managements fault. They don't turn over enough tables for it to be the waiting staff issue mgnt would rather have the kitchen microwave an app then make something fresh. We went there with high hopes but left with the understanding that they'd rather serve stale food quickly then good food on time. We tipped out the waitresses but left because she had no way of getting good food out on time. You're at west gate learn how to put food out........"}
{"text":"I've heard really good things about this place so I decided to bring my bestie here for her bday. When we got here we were the only people here and Megan our server was courteous but it took at least 30 minutes to get our food. I ordered the short rib sliders, my bestie got the salmon sliders and my boyfriend got the bacon and fried egg sandwich. I started this review with a two due the lengthy wait but I will add a star because my food was good. I would recommend Bar Louie, just don't come on a Sunday!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today on my lunch break with some work friends. It took them 40 mins for them to get our food. During this time we asked for it to get our food in boxes-because at this point it took 80% of our break to even get the food. Not once did our server apologize for the ridiculous wait or even let us know what was going on in the kitchen. Keep in mind we ordered very basic menu items.  Once the food finally came out it was mediocre at best. Never going back-especially for lunch."}
{"text":"This is your place to go with a big group for drinks and apps.  They have a ton of space and always seem able to accommodate large parties. The drinks are tasty and they have big sizes of beer you can order.  With that being said, the service is hit or miss. On our last visit after a parties game we swung missed in the service department. Our waitress disappeared for over 15 minutes no where to be seen while we waited for our check.  Also when our food was being served it all came out at different times. The person in our party who ordered a salad was served over 20 minutes after all of us.  The waitress was apologetic and offered him his salad for free which we all did appreciate. We all enjoyed are drinks and they have a nice list of appetizers, while the food is less than stellar.  The flatbreads are mediocre and looked unappetizing. I ordered a burger with a salad as my side. The burger was pretty tasty but hard to mess up.  It came with blue cheese and bbq sauce with all the fixings.  I ordered the salad as my side instead of fries but they somehow also served me tots which was fine.   To be honest there are better places to eat in the North Shore than here."}
{"text":"Great place for late dinner after work. Kitchen stays open late. Real good food. Full bar and real good service. Great location."}
{"text":"I had never been here and we decided to grab a bite before a movie. Great little place with good food and great service. I had a burger and fries and it was great. Cooked right, nice and hot, lots of toppings.   They had a great selection of drafts and other drinks. Good happy hour specials as well. Our server was very friendly and did a great job keeping our drinks full, getting our stuff out quickly and checking on us. I will be back to try more items and this will be a go to stop for before/after a movie. They have several TV's going where you can watch the games, etc. Open layout that makes it easy to see everything. I like all the round booths around the restaurant with the combination of high top tables."}
{"text":"Going into last night's pre-opening party, none of us knew what entr√©es to expect - so the surprise element in addition to seeing the chain's new location before the general public was pretty cool.  This Bar Louie has two bars, well, three if you want to count the outdoor seating area bar that is attached to one of the two bars inside. I tried very hard to remember what the location used to look like as Blake's but I really couldn't visualize it. They had built a new bar somewhat in the center of the dining area and had arranged a number of high-top and low-top tables around that general area, in addition to a generous amount of seating (stools without backs) flanking both of the indoor bars. In addition to those tables were about three or four high-top tables that looked like they could seat upwards of 6 to 10  individuals - my immediate thought was, how fab for a birthday party!! My fave table was right up front in the corner by the windows looking out onto the corner of Main and Union (so, it looked at the movie theatre and across at Champps), it seemed kinda VIP (I'm a sucker for any seating area with a lot of windows) and I will specifically request this table for my next group night out.  Once we sat down, we opened up our envelope that contained our *surprise* dinner selections - 4 entr√©es and an appetizer for the table.   Here's how our ratings went:  Appetizer:  Buffalo Calamari (hand battered calamari, buffalo sauce, blue cheese dressing) 4 Stars: Tasted good, but didn't like the \"cone\" they were presented in. As for the cone - think like, what pretzel sticks or fries would usually be served in. Just wasn't easy to get calamari out.  Entr√©es: Tuscan Chicken Pasta (grilled chicken, artichoke, cavatappi, fresh spinach, three cheese blend, basil, tomato, mushrooms, alfredo) 3 Stars: Very bland, no seasoning, would not order again.  Turkey, Ham, & Brie Sandwich (melted brie, ham, turkey, field greens, dijon mustard, blackberry jam, parmesan french bread) 4 Stars: Pretty good, bread a little soggy, hold the dijon mustard next time.  Shrimp Po'Boy (blackened or fried shrimp, lettuce, tomato, remoulade, hoagie roll) 3 Stars: Shrimp was good, but the dish lacked flavor overall.  Four Tacos Plato - Fish (blackened fish, onion, cilantro, avocado, queso fresco, salsa, black beans, & rice) 5 Stars: Spicy, but delicious.  As for our alcoholic beverage choices, we order a couple of Strawberry Fizz martinis and a Honeydew martini. The Strawberry Fizz had a distinct \"cough-syrupy\" flavor to it. The Honeydew didn't really taste like honeydew and had a very heavy coconut flavor. The beer/cider was good but, it would have been more helpful to have a full beer list available for the table.  Service was great, our waitress was very friendly and attentive. The boys commented that she reminded them of a cross between Lady GaGa and Amy Winehouse - which they thought was a BONUS. Haha.  Overall, I like the atmosphere, Bar Louie would be great for a group outing, the menu has a lot of selections, the drinks aren't bad (a little pricey at $9.50 a pop for those martinis though), and the service is friendly.  PS - Like the Bar Louies in downtown CLE and Lyndhurst, this new Louie location offers $1 Burgers on Tuesdays (5p - close) and $1 Buds on Wednesdays.  AND... for their grand opening celebration week they are offering the 1st Small plate free and $2 martinis all week (March 19th - March 25th, 2012), as well as nightly entertainment.  Looking forward to a return visit... Thanks, Bar Louie!"}
{"text":"Below average food but a good beer selection. I ordered the fish taco's and they were cold. My friend ordered the sliders and they were undercooked with a small medallion of meat that only covered half the bun. Probably won't be back for a while"}
{"text":"$3 drafts and half off small plates from 5-7 weekdays and you get a great view of downtown pirate burgh and front row seats for the passing coal trains!! bruschetta pomodora with shrimp was nice as was veggie flatbread (flatbread is a euphisism for very thin crust pizza, let's just call it pizza) .. my bartender , an energetic brunette, was friendly and efficient.. they have 3 or 4 local beers on tap in addition to the standards.. young professional looking crowd at happy hour .."}
{"text":"Unforunately, like other reviews, my boyfriend and I had ridiculously bad service here on a Friday. We came right after work for the happy hour. Placed our food and drinks order. Drinks came out but about an hour passed with no food... we told the bartender and he said he completely forgot. Finally, got our food and were ready for the check. Original bartender wasn't available, asked another. got the check, was cheaper than expected so we assumed a discount. Our original bartender came back, grabbed the check from us, and brought a new one... more expensive than the last because he forgot our second drinks...  very awkward."}
{"text":"I finally tried Bar Louie for work lunch, on a Friday. I was impressed with their efficiency and the fact that my takeout salad was ready on time(unlike other restaurants at Westgate). I ordered the pear and blue cheese salad, and they did follow instructions to put the cheese, dressing, and balsamic glaze on the side. The salad itself was good, with plenty of pecans, delicious glaze, pears, and cheese, but I was underwhelmed by the chicken. I was expecting fresh grilled chicken on my salad, but it was cold, old, sad chicken, presumably from the night before(as they had just opened for the day, it was clearly not freshly prepared). All in all, I'll give the place another shot, perhaps for date night. Their menu looks like it has a nice selection."}
{"text":"Sucks.  Service is slow.  Spinach and artichoke dip had no flavor (flavorless food in restaurants FREAKS me out because it is either old or expired...both of which are downright scary).  I told the server and she removed it from our bill.  And somehow they managed to make the dipping sauces for the pretzel sticks watery.  I don't know who's running the kitchen but he/she should be put out to pasture.  The Bar Louie downtown has better food quality."}
{"text":"My husband and I went last night on Christmas Eve. It was busy so we had to sit at a table that wasn't cleared yet. Before sitting down my husband asked a waitress if it was alright to sit there before it was cleaned and she said with a somewhat snotty attitude yes. Fine. We sat down and picked up menus and waited. And waited. We waited for 20 minutes and no one came to either clean the table or take our orders. We finally flagged down the bus boy to clean the table and ask if he could get us our waitress. He was really polite and said he'd get someone. That's the last we saw of him.   We waited another 10 minutes. I finally got up and approached a waitress as she was at the register and explained we'd been waiting for at least 20 minutes for someone to take our order and could she send someone over please. She was dismissive and snotty and just said sure. I wish I got her name, she had long light brown curly hair. Anyway, I had little hope at that point.   We waited another 10 minutes and walked out. My husband has never had to walk out of a restaurant before! Yeah it was Christmas Eve, we get it, but you signed up for that job. If you hate it that much and can't be bothered to serve people look for different work. You're far from the only ones working Christmas Eve so get your self absorbed head out of your butt and do the job you willingly applied for. In all honesty all of the wait staff seemed miserable... it was an awful atmosphere.  So aside from wasting 40 minutes the food selection is very limited and seemed really expensive. Same with the drinks. We walked down to Max and Irma's and we were served by a wonderful waiter named David who more than made up for the terrible service at this Bar Louie. We'll never go there again and will steer anyone away from going there too."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain. But the food and drinks are still good - and $1 beer Wednesdays? Yes please!  I've been here a handful of times - when the weather's nice, I definitely recommend drinking at the outdoor bar. It can be admittedly hard to get the bartender's attention, but there's such a limited timeframe in which drinking outside can be comfortable, so take advantage of it!  I think I've only eaten here once - I joined the Bar Louie club, and they rewarded me with a free appetizer! No catches - I got a plate of nachos for free during a Browns game. Awesome. The place was packed during the game, but so is every other place downtown! My roommate and I still got good service, and our food didn't take too long to come out.   Drink prices are a bit on the high end if you're paying full price, but it's a good spot to start the night or if you're going to have a calm and relaxing night. Good cocktail selection."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken nachos, boneless chicken wings, shrimp tempora, and salmon sliders... everything rocked! Place was packed but Christie was super awesome and handled the high pressure with ease. She was super friendly and great atmosphere for dinner or hanging out with friends!"}
{"text":"You should come here to check out their happy hour, which goes until 7 PM.   Great specials, especially the drinks.  Service is great.  Our waitress was very friendly.    The food was unfortunately pretty subpar.  We tried a flatbread, buffalo wings, and a quesadilla.  All of it was decent at best, and we even had to send back the flatbread because we were so disappointed.    I would recommend this for grabbing a drink before or after a movie at Harkins. I wouldn't recommend eating here."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where you go and you understand why they hold a 3 star review on yelp.  No host and nobody really seemed interested in seating us. We sat ourselves. Took about 3-5 minutes for someone to acknowledge we sat down  (and we were in bar) Server was aloof, like large chucks of time where we were saying to ourselves \"where the hell is she\" They substituted my bun for lettuce but used two different types of lettuce - shredded and iceberg - odd The salad was small - there was more on my burger than my salad Hair on the wrap (didn't bring it up to anyone as we were just ready to go, not that anyone really came around to discuss it with anyways)"}
{"text":"You're missing out if you don't come to Bar Louie on a Tuesday for happy hour! Their happy hour menu (M-F, 5-7 pm) includes $3.50 drafts and half off apps that my friends and I indulged in! I had a draft beer and we split the trio dips, which had queso, salsa, and guacamole. Then, on Tuesday's, they have $1 build your own burgers! You can choose beef, chicken or turkey to build your sandwich! I chose chicken and a few extra toppings to put on it. The BBQ ranch is really delicious! My meal was under $10 and it was a good meal! I'd definitely go back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Drinks were pretty good. I had the Tickled Pink Martini paired with the bruschetta pomodoro. The bruschetta was fresh and the shrimp were well seasoned.  The bar service left much to be desired, as we often had to flag down our bartender. The crowd was light but our bartender seemed a bit agitated. Perhaps, it was just a subpar night?  I'll give Bar Louie another try."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite before a movie. The bartender suggested the pineapple express as my fruity flavored drink of choice!! So so delicious!! We also ordered some hot wings to share and French fries, which I enjoyed. Good and fast service, will be visiting again."}
{"text":"On a Business trip and arrived late. only place that was open and liveley Thursday night. Large beer and wine selection and great burgers and appetizers."}
{"text":"Came here before an event at rivers casino. Our server was super sweet and fast! Thanks missy! Was surprised by how reasonable the prices were for happy hour. This makes bar Louie my #1 recommendation for a place to go before any event on the north shore- the prices and service can't be beat. Drinks were great too- lemon drop martini wasn't too sweet. Had the calamari and the spice was awesome. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Settled here after an evening of shopping. I loved the vibe with the high-top tables surrounding the bar, dim lighting, and the fire still ablaze outside. I'm excited to eat at the awesome bar outside in the summertime (Yelp Bucket List Item!). I ordered the Backyard BBQ Burger which was delicious! It had a nice crunchy texture from the onion straws, a splash of tanginess from the BBQ sauce, and a nice smoky flavor from the burger and cheese. I also had the loaded tots which were amazing. On a Thursday night, it was less crowded than I had expected especially for $2.75 martinis. I look forward to coming back and enjoying the awesome vibe and something else off the extensive food and drink menu."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio. The food and atmosphere was great until the people at the table beside us started chain smoking, which the wait staff didn't seem to care about."}
{"text":"This is a very busy bar. Their service is pretty slow, but probably expected due to how busy they are.  Their buffalo wings had a good amount of spice to it, not overwhelming, and the quesadilla was also delicious. I would say this is a nice place to chill at after work with friends."}
{"text":"My wife and I were on a date and were trying to kill time before our movie started at Loews Theater across the street and decided to go to Bar Louie for some drinks and light snacks as it was late in the evening.   When we first arrived we were seated back in the corner next to the bar like we did something wrong and were being punished for it. After 10 minutes and no waitress coming to our table we made our way to the second floor loft area and waited for someone to get up so we could grab a couple seats.  Once we were able to get a seat we both started off with Mason/ Dixon cocktails which features sweet tea, SKYY Citrus, fresh brewed tea, pure cane syrup and fresh lemon and come served in a Mason Jar. This cocktail was delicious as we each had two, but both swear that there was no alcohol in them what so ever! We basically just had sweet teas with lemon.  For our food we had Bacon Cheeseburger Sliders which features Applewood smoked bacon, cheddar, pickles and is topped with fried onion strings. They were pretty good. The bacon on them was excellent though. We also had the Pot stickers which are pan-seared pork dumplings topped with Szechwan sauce. They were outstanding!  After we got our food our waitress went M.I.A. and we had to flag down another waiter to ask for water and our check as we would have been late for our movie had we waited a few minutes longer.  We usually don't frequent Bar Louie too often so hopefully this was an isolated event."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER, ANWHERE!!   We sat at the bar, 5 minutes later a bartender asks us if we have been helped.. Duh, we don't have any drinks or menus in front of us and you appear to be the only bartender! I order a coke for starters, but get a sprite or something instead. After looking at the menus for two minutes, and waiting another ten I ask for the check, pay the $5.75 for two sodas and leave.   The bartender looked directly at me at least six times, but ignored us and washed dishes instead."}
{"text":"Food was good and the ambiance was great.. Sat outside on a nice Friday afternoon. The buffalo chicken flat bread was delicious and the boneless buffalo wings were good and made with real chicken! What a plus!!"}
{"text":"Extremely poor service and food is not worth the long waits. Staff is not responsive and manager was not helpful. This place is an overflow for Burghatory next door. Wait the 45 minutes for a good meal somewhere else and don't waste it here."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. Asked for water and was told they were all being washed. How about using any of the serval types of glasses that  you have at the bar to serve a party of 6 with water. You had no problem bringing cocktails and beer instead of water.  Was there two different nights because it was right next to the movie theater. Will never ever go back."}
{"text":"A few friends and I decided to eat at Bar Louie after our movie let out. I wasn't super hungry, so I decided to order an appetizer as my meal. I selected the nacho chip trio and substituted the guacamole for another queso dip. We wait for a very long time for our food and we all ordered appetizers except one person who elected to go with the burger. Our food took over 30 minutes! This seemed a bit long to wait for apps and a burger. When my nachos came out the cheese was cold and had that hard film on the top and oddly enough there was this solidish gel piece inside the cheese. My appetizer wasn't good and it took forever to come out. The waitress was nice, but was gone for extended periods of time, so I actually had to ask her when the food was coming out. I think I would stick to the drinks at this place. I believe they have a good happy hour Tuesday's? I can't remember."}
{"text":"Bar Louie is terrible. I wish the management would respond to some of the horrible reviews on here and correct the shortcomings of their restaurant/bar. We stopped in around 10pm last Saturday and the bar was semi-full. I think the only reason people were here was because the line for Tequila Cowboy wrapped around the block. We sat ourselves and proceeded to order some beers from the friendly waitress. The unfortunate thing was they were out of a lot of the various beers. Then, we went to order appetizers and guess what they were out of a few of those too! How does that even happen? The north shore is definitely happening on the weekends now so why wouldn't you be prepared appropriately? Anyways, when the appetizers came out, they were luke warm and mediocre at best. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"How to spice up a review to a place that is a chain? Tell it like it is brother....  I'll tell you this, I'd much rather watch a sporting event here than any of the cheeseball below avg. Zipps all around town. Wish they would open a Bar Louie in Scottsdale. It'd be packed.  Why do you think so Michael? I'll tell you why...  Their food is good, they have a great bar, ample tv's, good music and usually good looking servers...all that with a patio (this location) and a chill atmosphere.   What's not to like? They also usually always have some kind of event going on.    If you around Tempe Marketplace definitely check this place out.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Alright Glendale, a nice classy place to hang out and have stellar service, drinks and eats. Second time around is a charm. The thought that it can maintain its beauty will be the test of time. I know Bar Louie from the Chi-town and the last attempt was a bust and that old sight is the location for Calico Jacks. A recommend folks come and check it out!!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite location of Bar Louie! Our waitress Alex was super attentive despite the place being really busy! She took care of us and was such a sweetheart. She made awesome recommendations for my sisters who had never been here before, as we celebrated my sister's 24th birthday! She made our night really special and we will for sure be returning!!"}
{"text":"I had my first and LAST visit to this place last night.  I have NEVER, in my 45yrs of life, had such  horrible service at a restaurant.  We were going to a concert so I expected it to be busy.  Being patient when you know it's busy is one thing, but after an hour & a half, my patience was gone.  You know there's a problem when your server brings you your bill and you have to say to them, WE NEVER GOT OUR DINNER! I proceeded to seek out a manager to find our food that was M.I.A.  Our server came back and explained to us that the kitchen had managed to lose our ticket. Which had me thinking, 'Why didn't our server notice that we never got our food?' Oh, that's right..because we only saw her about once every 1/2hr!  Then we have another manager come over to our table, Chip I think, who preceded to throw our server under the bus, told us these long wait times happen (\"it is what it is\"), but threw in a few cuss words for good measure. He was extremely unprofessional, and frankly made the situation worse.  The only good thing about our experience with that they had enough sense to comp our bill, which barely made up for the fact that we ate two hours after we placed our order and missed a good 20 minutes of the concert we were going to. NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere at bar Louie my experience was great the restaurant was clean the bathroom was average the wait time was excellent. However an individual in my party food did not come out with ours she received her food by the time we were finished with our meal because the kitchen lost her ticket . we were the only party and  another table in the restaurant at that time so I'm not sure how that happened my food was good and I had a great time and the drinks (strawberry lemonade sangria ) was good as well. I order the voodoo chicken and it was very flavorful my friend ordered the fish and chips and it comes with a boat load of french fries and a French fries are really really good I however did not like the Keylime pie I was expecting more of a pie and  not a cake but it was OK and a tablet cake was good as well. There are plenty of alcoholic beverages and I just love the atmosphere I will return."}
{"text":"I have been to Bar Louie a couple of times. My overall rating...I like!!! I was there for a bachelorette party and for a just a quick lunch with friends. The service was great at the bach party but only ok last Saturday. They have an excellent dirty martini and the bruchestta was yummy. Another fav was the strawberry fizz martini. A few of the girls had wraps and raved about them. We will be making girl's night out to Bar Louie a regular occurrence! The bar is decent size and they have a party room in the back. The patio is small but good enough...other locations have a bigger outdoor seating areas. A must try!"}
{"text":"So I walked down W.6th looking for a different place to have dinner.  I don't know what really made me walk through those doors but highly doubt I will be returning.   No greeting from the chick standing at the podium...she gave me some sort of death stare, lol (oooh chills).  So headed to the bar...wasn't really packed (it was after 6pm) and plopped myself down on the stool.  My server was a little annoying though, every three minutes she would say my meal was on the way (and I was there for like 20 minutes waiting for my food-so really it wasn't \"on the way\" lol).  She kind of worked my nerves when she continued to interrupt my conversations with a former co-worker about drinks, I understand once in a while but the timing was too close lol.  As far as the food, I loved the french fries...nicely seasoned (granted it was too much seasoning but that's how I like it).  I ordered the Sesame Tuna Sandwich and it was okay...it was a little dry...a little difficult to eat, lol.  I guess on to the next restaurant! Lol, wasn't really impressed with this place."}
{"text":"I'm on a mission to try all of their martinis. I haven't been disappointed yet! I like the food too, the dumplings were very good. I've only been to this one once or twice, I fell in love with the chain when I was in Chicago, same menu. the bruschetta was great also."}
{"text":"On Saturday night I went to Monster Jam with my family. Before the event we came into bar Louie and ate dinner. Our servers name was Sage. He was excellent!! He was completely attentive and very friendly even though the restaurant was packed. The food was also excellent. Our experience from start to finish was fantastic! We will definitely be back(:"}
{"text":"Classy atmosphere and a robust menu of good beer and tavern treats. The bartender was great and we ordered a few beers along with some avocado wedges. Great experience for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"If you can't handle a game day crowd, why open a restaurant next to a baseball stadium? We attempted to go here before the Pirates game tonight. We snagged what appeared to be the last inside table. And then waited. And waited. Hardly any wait staff on the floor.  Waited some more.  After 15 minutes absolutely unacknowledged, we walked out. No visible hostess or manager or anyone to even tell why we were leaving. Normally I'd chalk this up to an off night, but my husband has had a similar experience here previously."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite to eat and it was not busy at all. We sat at the bar and the bartenders was super nice and got our drinks pretty fast. We ordered the nachos and they were not worth it. The cheese was burnt which made the chips stick to the tray. The nachos were served on a pizza platter and was decorated with chicken chunks and smashed black beans. Very little chicken and not a lot of flavor. It came with a queso dip which tasted a little gritty. The restaurant set up reminded us of the Yardhouse, but the Yardhouse has better food."}
{"text":"We had happy hour this evening at Bar Louie because we are familiar with the Colorado location. The food was good as were the drinks. It was highly disappointing to discover on our bill that we were up charged for top shelf bourbon that we did not ask for nor given the option to request. We feel like the server or possibly the bartender were less than ethical in this practice and we will not return.  Beware patrons. Be very specific when ordering!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night. Supposed to be live music at 9pm an hr later still no live music. The food is mediocre at best. By pass this place and go to boardwalk Billie's around the corner. Much better bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Probably the worse service I've received. Do NOT come here if any event is going on or if it is at all busy. Under staffed. Poor menu isn't worth the wait.  We had to stand up and wave our arms in order to get any service. Forget getting another round of drinks."}
{"text":"I know this location has only been open for a short while, but overall our experience tonight was not satisfactory. The place looked great but that was as far as it went. The staff was goofing around the second we walked in, not paying attention to guests. When we asked the waitress about ingredients in their current special martinis she did not know and came back with a printout of each one. After we ordered, we saw the waitress enter the drinks into the system, but then it was over 10 minutes before the bartender started making the drinks as he was wiping the entire bar first.  While watching him make the drinks he spent half of the time eating things rather than actually making our drinks. We wanted to order more drinks, but the waitress never came back to the table to check on us. I would love to visit this bar again based on their specials and menu but probably will visit any other bar in westgate because the service at Bar Louie was absolutely terrible tonight."}
{"text":"Great happy hour here. Nice atmosphere and a nice bar. Stopped in before a concert in stage AE and got awesome beer deals. Marissa was a great bartender and took care of us. I'm a 5 star man."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Tempe is Bar Louie. Reghan is by far the best server they have and is the main reason I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Went here because of the astronomically long line at Burgatory. I had been to the Station Square location so I figured this would be a great place to try after the Pens game. There was literally nobody there, a far cry from the scene at Burgatory, which is always packed to the max (so much so that it's annoying). I got a burger which was fantastic. I believe it was called the southwest burger, because it had jalepenos, guacamole, and onions. The tots that I got with it weren't bad either. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the waitress had literally no clue about any of the beers I had asked about. I understand that its a newer restaurant, but I feel like the staff should have some idea what alcohol they're serving. She was nice and we joked about it, but I do feel like they should still know about all the beers they have on tap. My girlfriend got a martini, which she seemed to enjoy. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to wait an hour to be seated next door."}
{"text":"Met friends there on a Friday night. We were there early enough to be seated and everything started well. Our waitress/server was attentive. After ordering first round of drinks, service still good. Ordered appitizers, nothing special but decent bar food.  After receiving food asked person delivering if we could order more drinks, she said she would send server over. Our server was never seen again. Sat around for 30 minutes wound up at this point asking if we could get the check. Our server stopped by and said \" I was waiting for you\" for what we would have liked to know. WE were waiting to order more food and drinks but the service was so horrible my group of 8 left and went somewhere else where we could get actual SERVICE.  I will never go here again and make sure everyone I know knows about the crappy service received. Dont waste your money here, there are other better choices in Tempe Marketplace!"}
{"text":"If I could give this establishment negative stars I would! Literally the worst service I've ever received. Saddest chicken nachos on the planet. I understand being understaffed and busy but forgotten is a whole different thing. We watched the table next to us come and go a whole 25 minutes quicker than we did, with no explanation as to why we had received nothing. Never again Bar Louie."}
{"text":"So the food is decent, you can get $1 Burgers on Tuesday, but more like \"mini-burgers\".  The staff isn't that attentive, so be patient. Bartenders are OK at making drinks"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly. Food was good. It's a little over priced for a beer n burger joint. But all n all I would go back if that's what I was in the mood for."}
{"text":"Incredibly over priced place 1. Bacon Cheeseburger Sliders  -$9.79 or get a BBQ Burger/Fries for $10.79 2. Nachos at $16.99  3. Draft and bottle prices are the same..strange 4. One slice of Chocolate cake is $9.79  WTF? Did this chain decide to be the highest priced chain in America? I just had an hour long date here, but browsing the specials while I was waiting for my date (who was at the wrong bar), it appeared I should either be here during Happy Hour or on $6 burger Tuesday. Alas, it wasn't either of those times and I chose the $10 chicken quesadilla. Great value in this item as it as packed with some great white chicken and cheese - a very good version. This is a place to read between the menu lines to try and get good value.    Also its comical that there is no hostess stand, so most people walk inside and stand in front of the sandwich board not knowing what to do. It is unintentional comedy gold."}
{"text":"The barbecue chicken salad is amazing and the drinks are even better. Get the Orange mule or effen martini"}
{"text":"My friends and I came in about an hour before they closed on Sunday at 2am. Ned, the bartender, and Mickey the manager, were both excellent. Ned provided awesome service as a bartender, while being busy as hell at 1:30am. I would recommend this place to every person i know. 100% the most attentive bartending service ive ever had."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, and every time I am pleasantly surprised. It really isn't my kind of scene, but when friends come, we stop by here and grab a couple of drinks.  The service has always been friendly, the drinks are reasonably priced, and the appetizers were good. I haven't actually ordered any real food from here so I cannot comment on that.  For those who haven't seen this placed before, it seems like a place where young professionals who live or work downtown like to hang out. They have TVs with sports on, but it really isn't a sports bar...maybe more like an upscaled Applebee's?  I don't think I would take friends here for dinner, but I like it for what I use it for: a place to grab a drink before moving on to somewhere else."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for a late lunch on Saturday. We sat down and it took our service a bit before we even got drinks after we ordered we sat there for probably 15 min. Before the server walked by again I even had to get sweet and low myself from where they keep it. 20 minutes later she finally brought refills and I never got the water I ordered... Our food finally came and it was mediocre... My lettuce wraps were tiny shrimp and the romaine lettuce was all wilty and broken had to ask for more the tots were burnt or the oil was old... Just overall not that great of an experience . Then it took a while to get our check ... Pro. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Love this place, always consistent and they have an awesome drink menu. I've been to Bar Louie plenty of times and have never had bad service or sub-par food. Great place for drinks and appetizers outside"}
{"text":"I am a little surprised by the negative reviews. I have always loved Bar Louie and was excited to see one pop up in Charlotte. The atmosphere is great and the lights are dimmed. I have been here for lunch and after work dinner/drinks. The waitress I had both times was awesome. She was super attentive. I got the buffalo chicken flatbread twice. It is really good! I tried my friends mussels and they were absolutely delicious. They make great martinis. It is my favorite place in the University area to grab some reasonably priced good food. I can't wait to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here recently, only bc the places we wanted to eat at were all closed by 10:00pm, which is why I hate the University area, but I digress. We went in to order take out so we seated ourselves at the bar. Mind you, when you walk in, no one is ever there to greet you. Once we seated, we were greeted by a guy that seemed to be preoccupied. That can be overlooked however. So we ordered our food and ordered a couple of drinks while we waited. We ended up waiting a long time which is ok, but when we finally got our food, our bartender/waiter had clocked out and said he couldn't ring us up. Ok? So there were only two other young ladies that were bartenders, one of them had a horrible attitude (girl with braids) and the other was busy with the other side of the bar. So we patiently waited, while the young ladies seem to purposely avoid us. At least the bartender that waited on us could have told someone we were ready to pay for our food. Unacceptable. I literally had to go get a manager to pay for our food, which ended up being just ok. I draw the line at bad Customer service and bc of this I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Bar Louie is was it is. It is a chain but it feels local. It's perfect for Happy Hour after a day at the office or when going out with some folks from out of town. It's at Crocker Park so there is plenty to do nearby and has a great sitting area for in the summer/spring when they open the doors or you can people watch in the front area.   On Wednesday's right now they have $1.00 domestic bottles all day. That is amazing. What a steal. Happy hour, drafts are $3.25 each and 1/2 price apps. The food is actually pretty darn good too.   It's not unbelievable, but it is A-okay and a place I'll probably continue to go back to year after year, after work or for a quick local drink."}
{"text":"Great deal on their happy hour drinks; I came for the $2 martinis, which were excellent for the price. I especially loved the Diva and the Clover. Their $1 burgers were impressive for what you pay for as well (a bit dry if you don't get it with the sauce, but the patty was decently sized with good toppings).  The chicken wings were surprisingly tender. Sadly, I wasn't a fan of the sauce that came with it - but I tend to be picky when it comes to hot sauces in general.  Great service with typical bar food at a good price that tipped it to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with the service here. The service is so slow. Took forever to get drinks. Had 8 people at our table and everyone got their dinners at different times. My husband got his dinner and finished it before the cook came out an asked what I had ordered! He said ok and went back into the kitchen. No apology for the delay. Then when I finally got my meal the portion of fries I received was substantially smaller than the other guests at our table! One of our guests asked for a side of ranch four times and still never got it. The restaurant was empty on a Sunday around 3pm so there was no excuse for such poor and inadequate service. This is my first experience at a Bar Loui in general and I won't be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is just \"meh\". Service was very slow (it took 10 minutes for anyone to approach our table and even then the waiter said hi and that he'd be right back, but we didn't see him for another five minutes.   We ordered boneless buffalo wings with one dipping side of ranch and one side of blue cheese. When it arrived there was only one side (which appeared to be ranch) and we asked the waitress to bring blue cheese and she said it was blue cheese. She then said she would bring us ranch. Then our waiter came over and he said that it was ranch and he would bring us a blue cheese. We ended up getting one more of the exact same dipping side which, even at this point, we're not sure was ranch or Blue cheese but honestly tasted like a mixture of both.  At least the sauce on the buffalo wings was tasty.  Overall, this place has a decent patio, decent music and is good for groups. I recommend this place if you work near here and want an easy happy hour hangout at the end of the work day. But I wouldn't make this a destination restaurant."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  A big miss on the drinks. And, I like to drink!   Tried to order a Manhattan but they were out of sweet vermouth.  Ordered an old fashioned instead and was like drinking sweet tea.  The pulled pork sandwich was a salt bomb.  They didn't charge me for my meal or the old fashioned. They should have. I don't complain not to pay.  I travel and eat out a lot.  Seriously , they didn't have to comp me.  But, it's just not good."}
{"text":"Lastnight before the hockey game I had a large work group meet at Bar Loui to start the night out. I have been in sever times previously and just enjoy the food service as always been okay. Yet lastnight we had Nikole - by far the best service I have had there. She made sure as the rest of our group showed up everyone was taken care of immediately. Drinks were never empty and everything came out quickly!   Thank you Nikole"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour on the website saying it was at 10pm. They changed they happy hour to 11pm. Taylor the manager fixed our bill after we saw it, but it was still inconvenient to ask. However, overall the service was amazing."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Bar Louie and it was unbelievably awesome! Our bartender Blake was AMAZING! Great personality and was on top of everything! We will definitely be back to dine with him and eat some more of those delicious tots! Thanks Blake!!!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first night visiting Bar Louie. The service was great, the happy hour prices were amazing, and the Grilled Mac & Cheese Chicken sand which was to die for. I am definitely going to be coming back to Bar Louie."}
{"text":"My sister and I went to Bar Louie while visiting Westgate for the first time. I loved the wide open doors and the option for a variety of seating (outdoor, indoor and bar seating). We sat at the bar. The bar is nice and has little funny statements written in chalk where the alcohol bottles are kept. One of them was \"alcohol won't solve your problems, but neither will milk!\" Our Bartender Alex was Amazing! He was very nice and can make a mean drink!  My sister ordered a whiskey drink that wasn't on the menu and asked that it not be too sweet. He made a great drink and even added some fresh basil for extra flavor and flair! I ordered a gin drink, also not on the menu and asked that it include lemon. He did not dissapoint and made a lemonade type drink with fresh mint. It was so good..and pretty too! I enjoyed his creativity and fun personality. We also ordered their hummus app for a snack and the pesto hummus was my favorite! Super flavorful! My sister and I are visiting from out of state but I would definitely go back if I was in the area again and I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Westgate!"}
{"text":"Wow! So this place was a real disappointment! We walk by it every time we go to the movie theatre at Tempe market place so we decided to give it a try!!!  I wish we never did! Mind you I'm easy to please with food I'm on the \"seafood diet\" everything is edible but I ordered a simple baked Mac and cheese with bacon and grilled chicken. I got the most over cooked soggy macaroni ever and the chicken was so tough to chew I finally gave up. I ate 3 bites and couldn't take eating more of that flavorless disaster!!!  Out server was ok- not friendly but who cares? i would be too if I had to work thanksgiving day!!  To summarize I am never going back!!!! Never ever ever ....ever"}
{"text":"Poor/slow service, table was wet and full of old drinks, took forever to get it cleaned off and order drinks, also this place is right next to a train track, super noisy and distracting  drinks: New old fashioned: ughh, awful, sugary, syrupy, def would not recommend, an abomination to bulleit rye  Strawberry lemonade sangria: okay, light and refreshing but bad aftertaste, would not recommend  I know it's a chain, but when you're called bar louie, at least make good drinks, sigh"}
{"text":"This is one chain that I can dig. From dollar burgers on Tuesdays (5p-close) to $1 domestics on Wednesdays, I love this bar/restaurant. The food is amazing particularly the flatbread pizzas, voodoo chicken, and loco burrito. All of it is delish and not cheap, greasy bar food. The drinks are kinda pricey but happy hour makes it affordable. Nice outside patio for the summer. Mostly business casual dress throughout this place."}
{"text":"Bar Louie is a popular chain in the area, but it is one I much prefer for drinks than food. The food is very average, but some of their drinks are incredible. (Hello, Pom Peche martini)! They also have an excellent happy hour and a great view at Station Square. Service is typically slow, however, and food is a little pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Great environment at night! Songs going on very lively!! The food of my friends who ordered burger and fried shrimps was not that great. But I ordered chicken flatbread which was really delicious! Absolutely loved it  will definitely go here again just for the flatbreads"}
{"text":"All is well is at Bar Louie, firm handshakes, good music, cold beers.  The Killtlifter was cold, the music was spot on"}
{"text":"Besides having to wait what felt like forever (40 mins for food, and it was pretty empty a Tuesday night) the appetizer and main meal came out together and weren't that great. Had the mussles and were very salty. Also had Bruschetta the tomatoes seemed old and not very fresh. The bread that came with the meal wasn't talk bad. Overall not very good and wouldn't recommend it"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where the presentation is nice, but the taste is too ordinary. Friends and I went here for happy hour (starting at 5pm). They claimed to have $1 draft, $5 mixed drinks, and half off appetizers. When we got there, we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items, so pretty much the discount was pointless. We ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizers.   I only had appetizers here so I can't really judge them for their entr√©es, but I will rate according to my eating/drinking experience.  I got the spinach artichoke dip. It was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. For a dip, it had way too many obstacles built in to it. I don't know what they did with the artichoke, but it was super fibrous...I felt like I was chewing grass.   Overall, I would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain. Food was way too average for the high price."}
{"text":"This place is the epitome of westgate restaurants. Worst fucking wedge salad I've ever had in my life. A brick of iceberg lettuce, no dressing, no flavor, huge pieces of green onions. Who the fuck wants to eat a three inch piece of green onion?  Fuckin nobody.   The waitress rudely told me to look at the menu when I asked about ipas. Then two of the ipas I asked for that weren't sell out craft were out.  Well get a pen and scratch them off the menu if it's that difficult for you to name five ipas.   The bathrooms were filthy and out of paper towels. The bar was stacked with dirty glasses. Take that shit in the back and wash it. Customers don't want to see that shit. We are talking a Saturday afternoon and the place is half empty. I don't want to ever experience this place when they are busy. One waitress was stalking our table while the other one tried to fight her off. Really weird. She reminded me of a kid trying to sell chicle and not giving up.   Possibly the third worse whiskey sour I've had in my life.   Will never come back here. Fuckin westgate sucks."}
{"text":"Outdoor patios draw me in like a moth to a flame. So the restaurant and I started off on a good foot. Despite having to move the umbrellas around ourselves to create some shade.   The food was a little better than just ok. It was actually better than I was expecting from this bar.   We got the Calamari which was good, California Chicken Club, yummy! The vesuvio melt was average and the Blue Moon Fish and Chips which were ok. Overall it wasn't to bad.  The server was a ditz but competent.   I would go back prices were reasonable and it would try more of the food."}
{"text":"This is by far my worst experience in Bar Louie. I came here looking for the jerk chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps and I asked the waiter for them and he said \"sure I will bring them right out\" and come to find out they don't even have the jerk wraps anymore. Then I ordered the voodoo pasta and when it came out it was missing the shrimp and instead of taking the order back he brought out some half cook shrimp. We ordered some drinks and the drinks came out wrong too so overall it was a horrible experience. Oh, I forgot to mention we saw another waiter with some food that we thought looked and got her attention and asked her what was it and she seemed like she had an attitude because we asked and walked away mid sentence. So we will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Food was good,  so was the service.   However,  this was the first time that I've seen a mouse running around in the dining room of a restaurant, informed a staff member, and not had them flinch!  You get these serviced once a month?!!  Don't think it's working.  I can only imagine the conditions in the kitchen.   As a former restaurant employee... completely unacceptable.   If I had seen that before our meal was done,  I would have left."}
{"text":"Good food, decent service, entertaining bartenders. Wish they had better food deals (not just happy hour). Comfortable, chill spot."}
{"text":"Like a lot of other reviewers, I found myself here on a Tuesday night after 5pm for the slammin' $5 specialty burgers deal. Unlike most others (probably), I found out about the deal at approximately 4:45pm and immediately convinced my roommate that we needed to go that night.   Upon walking up to Bar Louie, we found a rambunctious crowd, with pretty much all of the patio seats--on both sides--full, despite it being a chilly December evening. That's how hoppin' it was. We walked inside and were pretty confused due to the lack of hostess stand or any nearby workers. We caught a waitress walking by, and confirmed that the entire place was open seating. Totally fine, just would've preferred that it was somehow made clear. We lucked out and found a couple seats at the bar immediately, where the specials were explained to us and drink orders taken right away.   We both opted for the burger special, because how can you pass up a regularly $11-12 burger for $5?! (Ya can't). I went with the Bulleit burger, cooked medium and with a side of fries, and she went with the Southwest burger. The burgers took a little while to come out, but that was to be expected with how busy they were that night. My burger was really great, but to be honest, I pretty immediately scraped the cream cheese block off of it--I was iffy about it in the description to begin with, but into the rest of the burger enough to try it out. I just thought the inclusion of cream cheese was a super weird call, considering the rest of the toppings were: bacon, crispy onions, and a bbq-like bourbon sauce. But like I said, after the lil cream cheese issue, it was a great burger. That being said, I'm not sure I would have liked it as much had I paid the full $12 price tag (I'm real cheap). The fries were also top notch, and I'm pretty picky about my fries. But it came with approximately a dozen and a half, and everyone always needs more than 18 fries.   Our service was good because we were at the bar, but it looked like some others at tables and booths were having some issues getting staff members' attention and such.   Overall, I'd say it was a decent experience. The food was good, I just always want more french fries. The environment was a little overwhelming, it was pretty damn noisy in there, and super crowded for a Tuesday night--assuming this was due to the special. I'll probably give Bar Louie another try. Probably on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"I've  visited this location  twice within a week.  Both times  very  poor service. If  I could  give 0 stars for the waitress attitude I would.  I noticed that they  have all new employees  that don't  take job seriously.  I  also  noticed  employees  that I assume  was off  sitting  at bar  drinking  going behind  counter to fix what they wanted.  They got my food  order  wrong twice because they're  to busy playing  and not focus . The waitress  got mad because  my food  order  was wrong. She walked  off and kicked the door  and was very  very  angry. In the  pasted  Bar Louie  service was great. I've  noticed  that Stephen , Jordan bartenders are no longer at this location.  They  was the best. Mary the waitress  no longer  at  this place. They went over and above  to make  sure you got  top notch  service. .  Will not return  for a while. I pays well for great  service  . Bar Louie  at this time  is not offering  this service."}
{"text":"Walked in for a quick bite to eat. Had a sign that said seat yourself. Waited 10 mins. No one greeted us. No help. A few servers just walked right past us. Dirty table. Poor service. I know it's no 5 start restaurant but you would think someone would at least acknowledge us and say it will be a few mins."}
{"text":"I get it...the restaurant got slammed.  After 90 minutes - more than any reasonable person should have to wait for anything - we still hadn't gotten our water, let alone our food.  The waitress apologized and then disappeared.  I had to hunt her down to tell her that I was leaving and that she should cancel my order.  Did she offer to comp my meal to get me to stay?  No.  Did the manager come over to apologize?  No.  Did anyone offer us even a couple of dinner rolls to tide us over?  No.  Will I go back?  No."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I heard Bar Louie was coming to the north shore! I live in the area. But after the 5th visit and 5th time I had bad service I'm done. Two times the blonde girl bartender was rude. Many waitstaff have attitudes or seem to disappear for long periods of time. I could understand during game or concert days but every time it was an average week night. BL really needs to educate their staff on proper steps of services and how to treat their customers in a proper professional manner."}
{"text":"It was a lackluster experience for me. Pricey foods served with modest portions. Hardly any drink specials and the average price for drinks is about $10 bucks. The dressing for the chicken wings was watered down and I could not tell if it was ranch or bleu cheese. There is a bar around the corner called NC Tavern with greats prices on drinks and food, but they were not quite open on my lunch break. Service is kind of slow and food may take a while. French fries were served some time after the blackened salmon sliders came out (which were amazing by the way). Good food but you do not get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after a meeteing one day, a very warm day, and was seated immediately (it was 11:30 and empty - they restaurant had just opened, I believe). I was greeted by a really friendly girl who was also our waiter.  Super quick service, on point. My glass was never empty and she never rushed us as we sat and talked well after our lunch was finished (I wish I could remember her name!).   I ordered the Chop Chop salad and it was large. It was super filling and had just great, fresh ingredients. Very good. It had a dressing on it that was so delicious I almost asked for extra to take home!  My friend had the Sesame Tuna sandwich and he said it was probably the best he'd ever eaten!  This may be a chain, but it doesn't feel like one and the service is beyond what I've found at most chains.   The only negative was that it was a 90 degree day and they offered no relief from the heat. I was expecting maybe a fine mist, but there was nothing. Just me sitting in a suit sweating to death. Thank goodness the refills were constant!  Regardless, try it, I think you'll really like it!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since it opened and the experiences have been pretty good overall. The service is generally kind of slow, but the bartenders have always been friendly and attentive. There was a strange incident one time when, after seeing ourselves, and putting in drink orders, we were told our table was reserved (for a time an hour and half in the future) and when I glanced over that way later, there was no such large party at that table. The drinks are always good (large cocktail selection and the Bloody Louie is a must for brunch) and the food has been pretty good but nothing has really stood out so far except for the chocolate cake."}
{"text":"Food is not the best, but service is good.  The ambience is OK... I can't stand the live music --- it's unbelievably obnoxious and loud.  I probably wouldn't return because the food is really nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Came here for late night eats and drinks - yum!  Service was great and our food was yummy."}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband and I always stop here before any concert or pirate game we attend. The food is delicious, especially the loaded tots! Great service too, I never have to wait too long for someone to take my order. I've never had a bad experience here. I highly recommend Bar Louie!"}
{"text":"So far it's ok. The veggie flatbread with chicken was really awesome, however the drinks were ok..... much better in Woodbridge, VA (yes I live in AZ) for all of the renovations this place did they should also have done that Same care into the bathrooms (Same as the last 2 residences) very old and outdated for this place."}
{"text":"Yikes. Stopped in before a concert. I ordered the boneless wings. Not only did they take forever to come out but once they did half of them were raw. Not just a little pink, straight up raw. The manager was apologetic and comped it but that was disturbing. We tried the nachos next, they were o.k nothing special. North shore has so many good options, skip bar louie!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst experiences I have ever had. We had a party of 9 and I understand sometimes things take time.... but our waitress was EXTREMELY unfriendly and kept blaming every mistake on the kitchen or other tables (she even blamed us at one point to another table saying we were taking too long) ... we wait over an hour for the first round of food to get here, the second round didn't come until half an hour later. All of our food was cold and one meal was forgotten.... she offered to comp the meal which was nice... but didn't even bother getting the food she forgot. we had to go ask her for the food that was forgotten and it had been sitting on the counter.... cold as well. Then we ask for our checks, another 30 minute wait.... she doesn't even bring the correct checks and instead of bringing them to our table, sets them on the table next to us and we had to grab and sort them. The food that was supposed to be comped was on the checks and we were missing a check. She doesn't come back until the ones of us that had our checks put down our money.:.. another half hour wait to get our cards back.... and she comes back with the check she forgot. Never apologized once and never admitted to a mistake.... overall terrible experience and won't be going there again anytime soon or ever....."}
{"text":"The chocolate cake was delicious,overall the food was good just not great. The peach tea was lacking in flavor,not very sweet and didn't taste the peach."}
{"text":"Servers are chatting, not paying attention to tables. I can see my salad is ready at the window. Worst serves ever."}
{"text":"The look of the place is upscale. The place was relatively busy for a early Friday night, packed with people who thought they are better than they are. The whole vibe of the place was a little pretentious, especially for Cleveland. They even think they are so special that only half the drinks actually have prices. This isn't Hollywood.  The food was ok. Nothing special, but priced according to the decor. The service overall was a a bit disappointing. Who  doesn't ask what condiments or anything else they  want, when they deliver your burger or other food.  I had to wait long enough for my burger to get cold to get any of it.  So overall the price value ratio at this place is so-so. If you are looking to meet some people that are overdressed, or under-dressed depending on how you look at it, I imagine its a great place. But if you want dinner and service early Friday evening (8pm) you might check somewhere else."}
{"text":"The only reason you should step foot into this place is because of Jackie. She's a dark haired raven. Lovely and sweet. She actually gives a Shit about the patrons. Here's to you Jackie"}
{"text":"It's what I expected. Cooler then a Fridays and the food was about the same. It was clean and out waiter was really cool. It was so slow he even took a seat with us and chatted but in a good way and we welcomed him to do so. I had the bar Louie burger for my meal and it was good. Nothing outstanding but again what I expected. My group ordered the avocado fries and meatball appetizers. The avocado fries were good but we had to add salt. The meat balls with the small slices of garlic bread was fun to share and yummy.  We went on a slow Sunday night. It was clean and the food came out on time. Again I rate a places on what I expect it to be and what it try's to be not what I think it should be. So just a different kind of Fridays. Also great music playlist."}
{"text":"Brought the In Laws for their anniversary dinner. I had the Bulleit Bourbon burger which was excellent!!!! Hubby had the Southwest Burger which he loved. My MIL couldn't stop raving about her Crusted Lemon chicken and my FIL ate all his Philly burger! I also had the Diva Martini which was awesome! We will most definitely be coming back! Our waitress Allison was on point!"}
{"text":"I use to come here all the time with my friends, but lately we would have to wait over 30 minutes for our food. When you first walk in you can see all the servers bunched up in the back corner, and it would take them awhile before they come and ask what you would like to order. Also, they always forget to bring out meals if you come with more than 5 people."}
{"text":"I loved this place when it was Darcy McGees, so I was hoping the service would live up to the menu. While our food was great, and I mean GREAT, and the beer was good, and cold, when it arrived, trying to find our server was like the movie \"The Great Mouse Detective\". She was flighty at best, inconsistent, and non-attentive.  Also, what is with the blaring screamo music? It's not at all appeasing to the type of atmosphere that could happen."}
{"text":"I don't frequent Bar Louie, and I really don't plan to change that any time soon. I've eaten here and stopped in for drinks a couple times over the years and I just haven't been super impressed by the place.  The food has been decent - a few years back I splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it, glutton that I am - but their meals and appetizers alike have admittedly never \"wowed\" me. And while I enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way overpriced here. Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like don't qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. Once I stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. Not even a large one, either! Sorry, but I find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there's cheaper places to get drinks in the area.  Still, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here. But good Lord, they're just so loud! I always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard. Not cool, Bar Louie. Not cool.  So while the food and drinks are fine enough the loud venue and prices mean that this is definitely not one of my favorite places - and given the other options we have at the Waterfront I don't expect to be back in any time soon."}
{"text":"Here's the thing. I have heard super awesome things about this place, such as the environment is great and the people are friendly and the food is good, right? Well, our group of four got there, and sat down at a high table, which, by the way, not enought room for four, so we scooted to a bigger table. Our server proceeded to take our drink orders, and it took 15 minutes for us to get our waters. He then took our orders, saying he would memorize them, didn't write them down, and went to put the order into the kitchen. About 45 minutes went buy without our food, and when our food did get to our table, all the orders were wrong. He then blamed it on the kitchen, and took the orders back and it took about 20 minutes for them to be corrected. One in our group had a bigger portion of what would be leftovers, and a lady brought him a super small take out box. Prices were reasonable, the environment was very nice, but we will not be eating there again."}
{"text":"Whenever I think of Bar Louie, I mentally shrug. That's because whenever I visit one of their locations, I usually find overpriced food (compared to what you can find elsewhere) and a so-so atmosphere. Such was the case with this Bar Louie.   I came here a few months ago to celebrate a friend's birthday. I'll say it now: our party was quite large and did take a while to arrive. So while sometimes I went a while without being checked on by the staff, I'm willing to let it slide. It was Friday; we were a big group; we were a big group that didn't arrive at once. That's a lot to keep track of. And by the end of my visit, it was getting so loud I could no longer hear myself thinking - so I can only imagine what it's like working through that din all evening!  I personally ordered the BLT wedge (with salmon added) and a cocktail, and shared the nachos as an appetizer with the table. The salad was decent - the nacho chips, however, were stale and bland. And honestly, that's all I can really say, because in addition to being relatively expensive, Bar Louie's food is pretty average at best. I never find the ingredients or flavors particularly memorable. My main dish was exactly what I expected; the stale nachos were sadly disappointing.  My visit overall was pretty much what I expected. I knew I was coming here to enjoy time with friends more than the place itself. So Bar Louie served its purpose. I admittedly I will not run back to visit soon."}
{"text":"Table and chairs were not cleaned. Food is ok. Waiter service was terrible. Servers socialized with each other instead of working. Had to go get them to pay our bill."}
{"text":"I can't really say much about this place. My friends and I sat down and weren't greeted for about 5 minutes. The food on the menu looked pretty good but I wouldn't know because we left due to the lack of service."}
{"text":"I went with some work friends before catching a movie later that night.  We got to Bar Louie a little over 2 hours before the movie started, which left us with hardly any time to spare by the time we were done.  We had a table right away and the server took drink orders, but it took 15 minutes to get our drinks.  She then disappeared for 30 minutes before coming back to take a food order.  The food took almost an hour, and we had only ordered a couple appetizers.  The portions were really small for the price, and most of the food came out burnt.  I did not risk mentioning it at the thought of waiting another hour for new food.  Again, waiting for the server to bring the checks after the meal was an ordeal in itself and took much longer than it should have.    The place was busy, but not overcrowded, what I would expect on a typical weeknight.  There is no excuse for the poor service and food.  On top of that, the restrooms were extremely filthy and clearly had not been stocked or cleaned recently.  Maybe it was just an off night for this place, but I do not plan on going back again and taking that chance."}
{"text":"Had a couple drinks with my buddy tonight. The bar was clean the restaurant seem nice and the staff was amazing. There wasn't too many people there for a Saturday night but the wait staff was constantly cleaning and asking us if we needed anything else. I could deal without the ear numbing music For their only being 50 people there but it was still a good time."}
{"text":"I ordered the vegetable flat bread and a diva drink. I was surprised at the portion size of the flatbread it's a pretty good size, I even had some left over. The drink wasn't strong but it was tasty. The service was good also, no complaints with the service everything came out pretty quick."}
{"text":"We went there on 12/23 at night when it was a rainy but warm December night (65 degrees). The inside restaurant/bar was crowded but the outside patio which was enclosed and heated and WARM was open and had people at the bar and some at the tables. We sat down for some drinks and appetizers at the bar. After noticing us there the bard maid who had her tits hanging out came up and said she was closing the patio due to people INSIDE complaining it was cold??? Without asking to find us a spot inside or any alternative she just said I'm closing the patio. Well we left and the Yardhouse which is a far superior bar got our $50. Won't be back!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here a total of 4 times.  3 of those visits were great.  Good prices,  good food and a nice place. I'll just make sure to check first how busy they are,  and that they're staffed appropriately, and it should be a great experience."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. The bar area gets rather crowded at times."}
{"text":"The location is awesome but we wondered why they were so empty on a Friday afternoon while the nearby restaurants were very busy. The service was great and so was the beer but the food was nothing special. Louie burger and backyard BBQ burger were both very dry and over cooked. The tots also tasted as if they were frozen then just dumped in fryer. Definitely over-priced for the quality."}
{"text":"Spinach dip took 45 minutes to come out and was cold (3xs). Had the BBQ Chicken flatbread. It was delicious and the drinks from the bar was excellent. Didn't like that there was no hostess to seat you either.....Overall, food was great, drinks were excellent, service needs work"}
{"text":"After a long day traveling we came upon Bar Louie. We had great service. Our bartender Carla was wonderful and gave us a few recommendations for dinner that we really enjoyed. Next time we're in Cleveland we definitely will hit up Bar Louie again. Loved it."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE and always a long wait for drinks. I wish the service was better because I do like the food but waiting a half hour for drinks is absurd"}
{"text":"Love this place... but first time at this location isn't starting out too good. Walked in ... manager said open seating feel free to sit anywhere. Nice. Sat down after about 7 mins my husband went to look for someone to serve us... found manager he apologized and went to find a server for us. After couple mins he came back and took our drink order. Then a server finally came. Took 24 mins to get our drinks!!!  Wonder how long our food will take."}
{"text":"First visit to this location and was pleasantly surprised with our dinner choices on a Saturday night since our first three options were closed for business between Beachwood Mall and Legacy Village. Fourth choice was the charm.  We started with the loaded tater tots and potstickers. Both were excellent.   Dinner was the Voodoo sandwich and it was great. Chicken was tender and moist along with fries. Daughter had the veggie flatbread  and the other daughter had the BBQ burger. Both were very pleased with their choices.  The chef even came to the table to ask about the flatbread since she requested no cheese.  Great customer service.   We will definitely visit again on our next shopping trip to the EastSide."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go, love it, love it, and love it!!!!!  Catrina was awesome, very friendly and my friends and I will continue to comeback!!!"}
{"text":"The servers and staff are slow to help you. We walked in the door and waited for a while before we were seated. The food is typical bar food. And the beer is just beer. The staff needs to realize that it is the way customers are treated that matters most. It will be tough coming back. Glad there are more places to eat around this area that are better. I don't usually snivel about a place but I have been to this place more than once and nothing has changed. Look elsewhere."}
{"text":"We liked waiter food was ok- but it took 20 minutes for a beer????? Average decent happy hr"}
{"text":"Had the chicken nachos, a little spicy but big for the price. Good flavor between all the ingredients. It's an appetizer, but I had it as a meal. Made a mistake in my drink choice -- tried the Angry Sailor which came in a small mason jar and was $10. Too sour for my taste, and left a tart after taste. Friend had Pineapple Express and it was delicious."}
{"text":"So as far as corporate bars go you have to hand it to Bar Louie, they are there for you all day and all night, great tv package and quick service on a menu that hits all the bases. happy hour and daily specials blow everyone else out of the water, from dollar burgers to $1.25 beers on Wednesday you have a reason to visit pretty much every day. Staff is always pretty efficient but there was one server that was on point on my last visit, much to my dismay she informed me that it was only her first day on the floor, Kayla was a rockstar! I'll be back weekly.."}
{"text":"Combo review here:  wish I could go with 2-1/2 stars - I would go back for happy hour only... read why:  Service was 4-star. Our server was great. I would give her 5-stars if we didn't have to ask twice to have the other side of our long hi-top table wiped off before our other guests were due to arrive in a little while. They got there before she got to it.  Happy Hour was 4-star - great prices - especially the $5.50 martini. But... I tried the lemon drop and dirty martini... sent the lemon drop back, didn't care for the dirty martini, but my bro-in-law helped me finish it up.  $3.50 for a dos equis was perfect for me. 1/2 price apps was nice, too. Only had the trio dip and chips since were were going to eat dinner, too.  Dinner... barely a 2-star rating. the drunken fish and chips was a huge disappointment. was told 3 pieces of fish, each a little bigger than a deck of cards. Piled on a nice size side of crispy, delicious fries.  The fish was a little over cooked - the batter was dark brown. Since I sent the lemon drop back, I thought I better stick with the overcooked fish... bad mistake - the fish fillet inside was about the thickness of a few cards from the deck. aka - hardly any fish inside, and since it was so thin to begin with, it was way overcooked. Also - the batter was so thick, it filled me up on a bunch of carbs that I didn't need - I know, I ordered the battered fish, what did I expect??  honestly - a lot more fish!  Hubs had the fish tacos - said they were good. Sis had the beef sliders - she's had better. Bro-in-law had the ahi plate - he's had better.  heard the baked mac n cheese isn't really baked, and other ingredients are prepackaged frozen... no thanks. If I'm going to pay those prices, it should be fresh - and baked if it says baked.  Like I said above, we'll go back if we're just looking for happy hour, but I won't be ordering off the menu again."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good food, but the service however was just horrible. As a friend said they hire for looks, not work ethic. Plus the fact that it took forty minutes just to get a couple appetizers was ridiculous. Our server seemed more interested in the table full of girls than actually waiting on us. The couple behind us came in the same time and wasn't even attended too until after OUR appetizers were being cleared off.   The food was pretty good, but because of the service I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Was very skeptical to try this place and it turned out great! Their craft beers are very good. The vibe was very nice. Very spacious and I kinda like the whole idea where you seat yourself. Came here on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy! Our server came and greeted us started us out with some water. He was very kindly to explain briefly about the menu and recommend some of his favorite dishes from the menu. My friend got a Mac&Cheese grilled sandwich with pulled pork and she said it was very good! My other friend got their Voodoo pasta and she said it was the best pasta she hide. It was spicy so be prepared. I got myself a Voodoo chicken sandwich and woooooo their chicken was so savory and melts right in your mouth. I love this place! Although it was a pricy bill but I wouldn't mind coming back to splurge some good beers and food. Can't wait to be back already!"}
{"text":"This had been more than our first visit here. We came on opening night service was good, tonight thou... Corita was a smile as soon as we seat down, immediate assistance, friendly and personable since we got here. Made some amazing food recommendations for Appetizers and drinks. Didn't skip a beat to continuously check on us and kept the drinks coming. Honestly we will become frequent \"flyer\" customers LOL. We will be back and ask for Corita!! Thanks for a fun Thirsty Thursday"}
{"text":"Went here for a meet up.The Pink lady Martini and 5$ burgers on a Tuesday night could not be beat. The service was fairly good but a bit slow..but at 5$ for a full size fabulous burger no complaints!!"}
{"text":"Clueless, non-existent server, food was Ok, one order completely wrong, no sign of management, staff appeared dirty/ unkept , hair not covered or controlled even though dealing with food, table just sticky, silverware stained. Watched guests wandering around trying to get seated, walked out  ...... Needs a complete overhaul or it won't make it much longer."}
{"text":"Came in the other day the server Tiffany was very helpful and knew the menu very well and made me a good recommendation for my meal"}
{"text":"Somedays a diva needs a drink, and hence I tried their diva margarita. It was to the point, sweet and yummy, with alot of attitude. This diva margi meant business, it was like, I know I'm hot, so drink me up bi#$h! And, yea I'm a no business diva, so, I drank it all up coz as a gay black woman (my alternate persona aka as NeNe), no one challenges this queen. Oh, and tip, the calamari app needs help, it's salty and it tricks you with how much is served, that my loves is not a diva but a tranny tease."}
{"text":"Great service and food, especially for a quick lunch on the weekdays.   Bar Louie does it right...sure, it's a franchise, but their food is delicious and they make an effort to add specials and unique menu items.  I typically enjoy the pulled pork sandwich with Mac and cheese or tots."}
{"text":"Writing the much-needed brunch review: it was pretty bad! Our waitress was obviously in training, but she could have used much much more training to do the service. She was very slow on bringing our waters and our extremely watered down coffee. When we finally came around to ordering, she walked off without having asked how we wanted our eggs with the entrees. And finally, when we got our food, it was, for the most part, very cold and nothing to write home about.  I split the PB+J pancakes and a breakfast sandwich with someone else in our party. The pancakes were a hit, despite being a little cold - they strangely had some chocolate component to them, but it provided some needed flavor. The breakfast sandwich was bland as hell - no amount of hot sauce could make it palatable. Pretty disappointing! One last comment was that someone in my party tried to make their breakfast nachos vegetarian by replacing black beans with the original chorizo. They honored that but took away the eggs as well, leaving her with a sad, sad pile of chips. Such a shame!  Overall, don't waste your time or money on the brunch. It's gonna take forever and underwhelm you, and you could find far better breakfast down the street like at Jack's Deli. (Not a sponsor, just a lover.)"}
{"text":"Terrible.  Location is great while the service and food are horrible.  I had the chicken tacos and would never get them again.  The chicken was tasteless as were the tortillas, salsa, et. al.  Our server was also nowhere to be found."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my mom, aunt and sister for drinks and apps before catching a movie next door.  Happy Hour prices are great - 1/2 off Apps and Flatbreads, $4 glasses of wine (some are $10+ regular price), $5 cocktails. We had several rounds of drinks and shared four different appetizers and our bill was only $60 for four people. The boneless chicken wings with Szechuan sauce was AMAZING! and FYI, they don't have hot tea. But I bet most people don't come here for that. Service wasn't the best...drink orders seemed to take a little longer than necessary to come out to the table, considering that it wasn't very busy. Our waitress was okay...every time she brought something to the table she spun on her heels and ran away before we could ask for anything else. Took me three attempts to order a drink and we only had our water glasses filled once the entire time. We asked another waiter at one point to send our waitress over and he said she was too busy. However, he was kind enough to help us out and he was 1,000 times quicker than she had been. Overall the food and drinks were good and the prices are great. Service is just a little lacking!"}
{"text":"Wens is a great night to come up to bar Louie dollar bottle beers and live music is awesome"}
{"text":"Besides having decent bar food/prices, Bar Louie is terrible. Service is horrible. Table was sticky. Even on a slow evening everything takes a long time. Came in with some coworkers and it took at least half an hour to get our appetizers. Our server had tables across the restaurant and had to rush back and forth. Took him ages to refill our drinks and get beers to the table. We also split the bill and instructed him what card to charge more on and he charged the wrong card...   *There was one girl barking at customers \"You have two minutes to finish your drinks and food until we close\" and rushed off to complain to her coworkers that she has to work late. Don't work somewhere that is opened late and complain about it. The only reason why this place still has foot traffic is because it's in such a popular location. What is with the open seating in such a large space and the limited amount of servers working? No wonder why people are so against returning back to this establishment."}
{"text":"This is a good chain restaurant that I have experiences in other states and this one is very similar. However this one is a little higher class than the one in Denver and is slightly larger. Still great happy hour special and good appetizers. The service was good and quick and even gave me an appetizer for free when it took a little longer than expected. Needless to say customer care like that never goes unnoticed in my eyes. Was a great experience."}
{"text":"Wow! Extremely surprised by this place! We are from FL visiting Cleveland for the Indians Home Opener. After the game we were famished and walked upon this place. At first I thought it was going to be the normal bar food options but we were wrong. There are some DELICIOUS gourmet options here. Definitely the best food I had while in Cleveland. Great atmosphere also. Because of my experience here we have looked up locations closer to home that we can visit. Glad to have found this place!!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing time at bar Louie, our server Angela was very nice and accomdating considering the place was packed. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I gave this bar 3 stars. . I am from the Midwest and I like my beer a certain way just like my women;) Just kidding. I just wanted a Michelob Ultra in a bottle, with a glass, and a pickle spear. Instead Michelob Ultra, plastic sword with a round pickle on top of the bottle. This may be my new favorite thing:) I had the Bavarian Pretzel Sticks with all different sauces. I am pretty sure they were not cooked all the way through they were lukewarm. It was not a bad experience but it was not great either."}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday night. Not very busy at all. Our waitress was telling us how great the food was and how we should expect amazing service and all this and that. Sadly, she didnt come back for a good 10 minutes or so. She said she got busy, but with only a few tables in the place occupied, I was wondering how that could be. They didnt seem to lack waitstaff either as I saw a good 5-6 of them milling about. Her and one of the bartenders didnt seem to know about NASCAR when we asked to have that put on a TV. I ordered a bottled beverage, and she had to come back and confirm with me what it was, and im glad she did because it wouldnt of been right. The food was pretty good. Pretty nice atmosphere. Our waitress was one of those types that seemed to think she was really good at what she does, but she really wasnt. I'd try this place again down the road."}
{"text":"Glad to see an old Chicago favorite in the west valley, the staff is super sweet and the drinks are good. The menu is a bit different from Chicago but still good eats. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've only been here during their late evening happy hour from 10-2 AM but this is a great spot for some food and drinks. Usually I order their flatbread pizzas or quesadillas which are both pretty good in my opinion, though the flatbread pizzas seem to be better. They have a great drinks selection of course and is a great spot for happy hour due to the atmosphere. It's nice to be able to hang out and relax here.  Outside of happy hour this review might be different, but from simply reviewing their happy hour I can say that I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Movie date with my daughter decided to get a bite to eat after, she suggested Bar Louie because she and her husband had been twice before and she said one time was good the other time service was terrible but she wanted to give it another try (you know third times a charm) it's about 3:30 on a Saturday so it was really empty inside, a few people at the bar and a table of employees (waiters, etc) on shift sitting at a table eating  whether on a break (they were on shift) or not I find it pretty unprofessional to take your break in a group out with the customers you're suppose to be serving. We grabbed menus (they are on the table) they were GROSS with food stuffs smooshed on the pages (looked as if they had never been wiped at all) don't know why, but we ordered anyway (they have appetizer plates stacked on the table) went to hand my daughter one and as I lifted it it kind of stuck to the one under it and OH BOY there was a dirty (I think chocolate cake) plate  it had not even been attempted to be washed. Needless to say my first visit and my daughters third and last visit for both of us."}
{"text":"Its Bar Louie.  Over priced drinks and lots of people.  What could be better?"}
{"text":"Was looking for a mid-level restaurant bar besides TGIF and thought to come here.  I have come here 3 previous times and the service was terrible.  i figured this time i would go on a slow night and sit ar bar to ensure prompt and courteous service.  That was not the case.  They really need two bartenders at a time, a hostess (seating yourself is not working), and a good wait staff.  The currwnt wait staff is not responsive and they lounge near the kitchen while customers just wait.  Nice menu otherwise if you can buy something."}
{"text":"This is not such a bad place after all. When I know some place is a chain. It can either be really good, or not so much! This place is good. Yes, I would come back here again for sure. Service is decent. The staff is busy and attentive. Lots of draft Beer, there is a lot to choose from, so it is hard to pick just one. We got the Hummus and the meatballs. Both were pretty good. Hummus comes with pita bread and cucumber slices, nice.  Matballs were not too bad either.  in all the shopping frenzey it was a nice break. We will come back again when we are not so busy and we can relax here.  It is Tempe Marketplace so it is at times tough to find parking and right now everyone is going frantic to get things done.  But, the restrooms are clean and so is the bar. I think it is worth another visit for sure."}
{"text":"Man, haters gonna hate.  Listen, y'all, Bar Louie isn't fancy.  It's just not and their extensive martini list won't fool me.  However, the food is good ole American bar grub and their beer selection is decent.  The staff has been nothing but nice even when my wannabe rowdy group of friends spent many a summer day sitting a table for four hours drinking dollar beers.  As long as Bar Louie still keeps having $1 Burger Days (Tuesdays) and $1 Beer Days (Wednesdays), I will continue to be a fan.  FYI, It's a fanatically cheap movie & dinner/drinks weekday date spot."}
{"text":"Two things: 1.) $1 Burger Night on Tuesdays. 2.) $1.25 Beer Night (domestic draft) on Wednesdays.  P.S. Decent service, good bar food, nice draft selection, bad martinis.  That's about it."}
{"text":"Not too busy on a Saturday night and insanely bad service. Food is average but at least the beer is cold. Parking in Crocker is always horrible but at least the valets are decent if you tip heavy. I'm sure there are better options out there for the same money."}
{"text":"Bar Louie at Legacy Village is one of our go to places.  They have a good happy hour with lots of food and drink selections and the happy hour is available throughout the restaurant.  Tuesday nights are $1 burger night.  Every thing you add to the burger -- cheese, mayo, onions, etc. -- adds to the cost and you also have to buy a drink (alcoholic or non alcoholic) to get the price.  For the two of us, two burgers with a couple of toppings each, a basket of fries and two beers was $22 so a good deal but a little more than $1 a burger.  The service can be a little spotty and it gets very busy at times but it's worth a try."}
{"text":"I decided to come out for dinner over the weekend, wasn't all that impressed.  Yes, they had basketball and the Olympics on but that was about it.  Drinks were overpriced and actually cost more than dinner for me.  The bartender was fine, but my drink was weak on the alcohol front.  They still had specials from the night before up on the board and happy hour deals up from during the week.  Not entirely crowded at 7 pm on a weekend should say something to boot."}
{"text":"While I admit I only drank there...the service was XLNT! As our group continued to grow the servers just went with the flow..(granted it was an early weeknight) those who know me know I don't frequent chains..but VERY limited choices at Tempe Market Place..so this will be the go to place for me the next time I find myself in the area...."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would.   Waited for a server for 40 minutes. After waiting for 25 minutes, one of us went inside to ask for a server and was told all of the servers were outside.   Do you think anyone came? Nope. Went inside again 5 minutes and was told the same thing. 10 minutes later a server finally came. \"It was confusion about who was assigned to the table.\" Yet 3 servers were outside that looked at us...not acknowledged by anyone of them for 30 minutes.   This is not the first Bar Louie I've been to but the only one in Pittsburg I've been to. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED!!! HIGHLY!!"}
{"text":"Baked Mac n Cheese with Chicken and Broccoli. Just get it. Don't ask questions. Lol but seriously best mac n cheese ever! Mario Hoagie and Meatball Hoagie are awesome too! Great for Happy Hour too! :)"}
{"text":"Ok. Let me start off by saying that Tuesday's are the BEST day to come here if you want a cheap, not so fast, meal. $5 burgers -&- fries/tots (circa $5.38 w/ tax). This is why it automatically gets 3 stars. The downside to this is that their demand + quality = unsatisfactory @ times. They started making the burgers (meat portion) all \"well done\" which allots the burgers to become dry. I personally like mine medium-rare because it remains juicy and is not overcooked. The tots/fries are a hit/miss depending on 1) party size & 2) the number of customers ordering. This also has an effect on the overall service. When I was there, the waitress messed up over half of the orders because she did not write it down. When I did get my food, the tots were basically croutons. My burger was on the point of crumbling into dust b/c it was so dry (and I added ranch, ketchup, and a fried egg was on it). The drinks are definitely overpriced. They are located by UNCC, so they should absolutely lower the prices for drinks for students. The actual venue is set-up nicely, but it was extremely cold and the waitress did not know how to adjust/turn-off the ceiling fans (or didn't even try for all I know). Overall, the price for the burgers + fries/tots is worthwhile, but how they handle customer volume needs to be more embedded in their training program. O_o  ******************** Update 11/19/2014 - Bar Louie is now making you buy a fountain drink if you get the $5 special. Therefore, your bill is now roughly $10.00 w/ tip included. I went there for the $5 burger + tots, not for a freaking soda. I will not be back here for a while because of this peculiar & random add-on. Thanks Bar Louie for ruining the special. I will not tell anyone else about you guys! o_O"}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant several times, and have been fairly happy. Tonight, it was a different story. There were only three in our group, and two ordered the burger special. I ordered a flatbread. The burgers came quickly, and I assumed my flatbread would follow. I waited and waited, without anyone checking on us. Finally, we were able to get our waitress' attention to ask her. She went to check on it, and said she guessed the kitchen was just busy with burgers tonight (it was special burger night). By the time my husband was done eating, my dinner arrived. It was good, but I took most of it home. Not much of an apology, or any compensation."}
{"text":"It's heartbreaking. I used to be a big Bar Louie fan in 2008 and early 2009. The food was always so good, especially the buffalo calamari. The service was always so friendly and patient, and a group of us used to meet there weekly for Beer and Blog. Then things changed. I'm not sure what happened, but suddenly the food was no where near as impressive as it used to be. Then the service went downhill. And, well, we stopped meeting there.   I hated the idea of leaving Bar Louie forever, so my husband and I decided to give it another try on date night during the recent holidays. We sat at the bar. It was filthy. The chairs were covered with crumbs and the bar top itself was sticky and just plain gross. We left before anyone could take our order.   It's heartbreaking that what was once a weekly favorite is now a place to which I'll never return. But I am hoping that someday it will get back to what it was originally, because deep down inside, I long to return."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I went for lunch and the service was horrible. Gave us plate with hair on it, then had to get up and go to bar to get another plate because waitress disappeared. Then bartender was rude, didn't say sorry about that, took plate and handed us another one no words exchanged at all. Won't go back!!"}
{"text":"This could not be a better experience! I've been there before, and I've always been pretty happy with how they sincerely show Monumental effort to make sure everything is dialed in as much as possible, today was no exception. I ordered the blue Louie which was a delicious burger with blue cheese and bacon and it was messy as to be expected as well as super delish, medium-rare! I paired that was some crazy good tater tots and Fries which again was no issue for them so big plus there, and I topped it off with a double tequila skinny margarita. My wife had a bourbon Burger which she enjoyed as well and had a super delicious mojito. The bartender is always on point when it comes to drinks, you'll be able to recognize him because he is a young man that is highly charismatic, you will not be able to miss him trust me. Great guy, totally made sure that we were taken care of on the drink side and the waitress was amazing! She did not drop a single ball, and we were so grateful to have such a fun experience! Kudos to all the great people that make it happen and make Bar Louie such a fun place to be! Don't miss it kiddos!"}
{"text":"Went here for drinks and nachos and it is a very nice establishment.  The nachos were very good the drinks pricy but t be expected in a setting like this place.  There are fire places outside on the patio a huge bar and even though it doesnt seat many there is a very nice cozy setting upstairs.  Go here to relax or enjoy good food both thumbs up."}
{"text":"good location, nice decor, ordinary chair restaurant food.  Outrageous happy hour price of $7.25 for a GreatLakes Christmas Ale, less than 12 ounces( served in a shifter). Server seemed indifferent & unenthusiastic."}
{"text":"When you know that a large party is coming in of at least 20 or more people do you not think to maybe add some extra bartenders? Service was soooo slow it wasn't even funny!!! Waved the bartender down like 4 times. When the bartender finally came and took my order as well as my friends she forgot his drink 100% and just walked away. She came back like 4 minutes later and asked him if he wanted a drink... A total wtf kinda moment there. I have been there one other time to the downtown location with another friend and his food came out cold :-/. Also what kind of company promotes an eating contest at their establishments? I don't remember if it was this location or the legacy village one but really have some class if you want to be known as a classy place that is relaxed. It is very pretty inside at all of you locations just work on your f&b service and maybe you will get more stars. Food 2stars, Service 2 stars."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite to meet friends for happy hour. I enjoy the $5.25 martini's, and have yet to try one that I haven't liked (the lemon drop is my personal favorite). The boneless wings are great, and the flatbreads are not only tasty, but big enough to share. The dinner's are also really good, the atmosphere is laid back, and I can't wait to go in the summer when I can be outside enjoying a meal."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant a higher review I would. The staff is amazing and beyond welcoming. Their happy hour deals can't be beat and the food is always on point. Definitely the place to go in Westgate!"}
{"text":"$1 burgers and $3 drafts will be missed. Other than that the place is good to watch the game and drink. The tavern itself will be missed here in vegas"}
{"text":"Comfy seating both inside and out, great view. Food Service was really slow and spotty (and we only ordered appetizers!), Our waitress checked on us periodically and we appreciated that. They also switched the channels to women's soccer when my friend requested which we really appreciated!   The pricing was a bit pricy for the quality of the food but i do give kudos to the waitress and the location. Our waitress really went above and beyond when we expected to be ignored."}
{"text":"Service crap 2 times in a row too many employees not taking the consumer serious and the manager is a poor example for this brand when he did come out he said listen I'm busy in the kitchen I was like whattttttttt is this real or a prank !!!!!!everyone at the bar was complaining and sending food back I'll never go back they need to bull doze it down to accommodate the train"}
{"text":"I know it's a chain, but I enjoyed myself here.  Staff was friendly and welcoming.  They poured my Guinness correctly and the pretzels were exactly the same as the ones at the Tampa Bar Louie.  Oh, may I mention this review is also from after a wedding, another bar, and at about 1 AM?  Mostly just service industry people hanging out at the bar after getting out of work at the restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"I love Bar Louie. But golly, this place is inadequate to the max. A caveat: living in New Orleans and reveling in that unique bar and social scene will spoil anyone and make any other bar scene seem inadequate and blas√©.  But Cleveland has some unique, independent hot spots that can compete with the any major market scene. Bar Louie, a regional/semi-national chain, is not one of those mirthful hot pockets.  The actual bar is accommodating, spacious. The service is solid. But the drinks are not good, and to make matters worse, Sweet Lou (as I affectionately call it -- you should, too) charges NYC prices for these drinks. That's a no-no. (The NYC parallels stop at the drink pricing.)  The food is really uninspiring. The only redeeming factor? $1 Burger/Chicken Sandwich Tuesdays. And boy, is this a redeeming factor: one that keeps luring me back in. If I had happened to be punching this review into my iPhone on a late Tuesday evening, I'd no doubt give Sweet Lou a five star review. (It would be difficult as hell read that review, too.)  Grade: C -- Alas, two stars it is. Despite being kind of horrible, I truly do love Sweet Lou, and I keep coming back. (There's definitely some sort of Freudian thing going on there....)"}
{"text":"Worst service ever - took over 1 hour to get food and over 30 min to get a glass of beer. Food was so so bar food so I can't fault them completely for that - but Service on a Saturday Night when your best revenues come in was ridiculous. Pass and go somewhere else please!"}
{"text":"Sunday night, 6pm, restaurant is less than half full. Took 30 minutes before a waitresses showed up....another 15 for my coke and another 10 for my boyfriends drink.  After 70 minutes, the food never showed up nor did the waitress to see if we even wanted another drink, which meant the check was completely outta the question. So we guessed at the check and put some $ on the table and left.  Can't comment on the food because the service was so bad we never got any food."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a higher rating. The food is worth something more, however, the service is terrible. I mean...absolutely terrible. As I write this, my server is out front flirting with girls from another table and eating pizza...after we asked him for our check. It took fifteen minutes to even get our drink orders...I just...don't come here unless you have an entire evening to blow."}
{"text":"Good food and beer but horribly slow.  I couldn't believe how long my first drink order took so I timed the 2nd order.  It took 19 minutes and 49 seconds to get my beer after it was ordered.  From what I could see, it wasn't the waitresses fault but she said the \"bar was really backed up.\"  The place wasn't even that busy.   Their happy hour menu only has 4 or 5 things on it.  I ordered the bruschetta and was told they were out of it.  Haaa...I guess this was a bad night to visit Bar Louie."}
{"text":"Was super impressed with the service especially on game day was seated and service immediately. Had the shrimp lettuce wraps which were awesome great flavors very fresh and tasty. Super quick service,very friendly staff highly recommend this spot"}
{"text":"I'd give this place zero stars if possible. The service was terrible, and it took over 15 minutes just to order a drink. I wish I could get my order back. Their version of a bloody mary tastes like you put water in a pepper shaker and drank it.   This Bar Louie is the same as the rest of them across the U.S. It's almost as if they are competing to see who can be the worst.  My main question is: why would they build an outdoor patio next to railroad tracks that are still in use (and are used quite frequently by huge freight trains)?"}
{"text":"I love Bar Louie's happy hour. $5 martini and half priced delicious veggie flatbread? Sign me up!  They also have a few other apps that  are part of the happy hour, but the flatbread is the one I usually get.   The melon martini is my current favorite, but most that I've tried have been good.  I don't recommend the shrimp appetizer. And I'm not sure about some of the other food, but happy hour is 5/5 stars. The rest of the time, Bar Louie is probably a 3 star place.   So, if you're in the waterfront and are thinking of Bar Louie, go for the happy hour!"}
{"text":"Went with a few friends for a Tuesday night which happened to be $5 burger night;  I think you can go beef, turkey or chicken for the special.  Ordered the plain burger which had way too much bread so I put the buns aside, burger looked to be factory formed and not freshly ground, slightly overcooked for a medium and lacked flavor.  Service was decent but not great.  I think our server had a shadow who she was training so I'll give them a little leeway for that, hence the 3 star; however I wish we went to In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Stopped here for happy hour. They have lovely outdoor seating and pretty good HH specials especially for the north shore. They have a good variety of draft beers. The food was good and came very fast. Our waitress, Missy, was extremely attentive and kind. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"It's just alright. Now the bavarian pretzel sticks - those were really amazing. Three different sauces to dip them in - a cheese, honey mustard and brown sugar cinnamon. The service was good. The drinks were alright. The philly cheesesteak I had was dry and not very flavorful. The prices are kind of steep. I wish I'd come during happy hour because I saw the flyer for it and they have some really good deals."}
{"text":"I've come for drinks about 4 times with friends because of the convenient location and late hours.  The food is good and perfectly fine, but cocktails are always cough-syrupy sweet. I'm usually willing to give bars the benefit of the doubt but they've consistently missed the mark, and I've ordered a wide variety: mojitos, margaritas, martinis, and at least 2 other drinks. Beer selection is pretty decent, and while I like the classy mood, branding, bartenders, etc., I always leave unsatisfied. It's a lot to pay for a $9 drink I can barely sip down without hurting my teeth from the sugary sweetness."}
{"text":"Worst service I have recovered at a restaurant. Took over 40 mins to bring my beer and after 1.5+ hours of waiting for my food I walked out in principle"}
{"text":"So. Well. The service was okay unless you actually wanted to receive all of the items that you ordered. The server missed my entree and missed my husbands drink refill. And then our appetizers and my husband's entree all came out at the same time. Mine just was never put into the system. At least we didn't get charged for the missing items so that's a plus, right?"}
{"text":"Ask for Xavier! This young man is an energetic server that goes out of his way to ensure that You have a good experience at Bar Louie. And a Cavs win doesn't hurt either!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars for one MAIN reason. SERVICE!!!  We were thwarted from our original venue who dropped the ball for a birthday party/ scavenger hunt.  Bar Louie totally accommodated us immediately. With a group of about 40, this was a quick accommodation.   Immediately we were greeted by Missy who jumped in to a rambunctious group gathering individual drink orders throughout before we got started. Returning about 2 hours later she picked right up and kept us drinking, laughing, food going and cleaning up around us. Never without a smile on her face.   The food is always good here. I probably wouldn't have considered having a group event here before, but will most definitely in the future and will request Missy for my server!!"}
{"text":"My father and I went to this establishment in the early evening yesterday and it was a lovely place with lovely service, so he brought me back there after the DJ was set up to show me how it changed for the night scene--which was nice for the 10 minutes I was there. My father had met some people and I went to the bar for a drink. Right after the bartender made my drink security approached me and asked me who I was with and I pointed to my father and told them I was with my dad. They went to get him and ushered him towards me and told us we both needed to leave.  I was completely shocked but did not argue with security and I asked the bartender for my tab, even he had a confused look on his face as I told him security was kicking us out. My father was the only African American in that bar, and I myself am half black. I will come out and say it--I have never experienced such blatant racism in my life! I also have never been kicked out of a bar! It was my father's birthday too. I flew in from Florida to so that I could spend time with my dad, and all I expected to do was to was to have a good time and make memories with him.  Well thank you Bar Louie because I will never forget this memory. I've experienced unfair treatment for being a female in a bar before, but never, EVER have I expected to be treated in such a way for the color of my skin."}
{"text":"This is one of the worse bars I have ever been to ordered the chicken nachos only half the platter had cheese and three little cubes of chicken bartenders were assholes when ordering drinks got charged different prices for the same drinks throughout the night wouldn't recommend this dump to anyone especially when McFaddens is across the street"}
{"text":"Great Effin Cucumber Martini. Really bad service. Ordered 2 sodas and 2 drinks from outside table. Got sodas and waited for drinks for 30mins. Asked multiple servers for help. Eventually went up to bar myself to find them sitting there awaiting the waitress who never came. Old wash rag left on table. Asked one of the servers if they'd like to take it away and they replied it wasn't theirs. Enough said."}
{"text":"To start.. this is the second one I've been to, and my expectation was low due to the bad experience in hawaii. We walk in at 630, towards the end of happy hour. We are told to sit wherever, so we did. We placed an order for a martini, a triple dipper appetizer, two orders of boneless wings and two flat bread pizzas at 645/650. Our drinks arrive nearly 20 minutes later, along with the chips and dip. The cheese was getting solid on top from sitting, the sofa I had also ordered was flat, both time I sent it back. At the 35 minute waiting mark from ordering we decided we were done waiting and asked for a manager. I told them everything above, and we would be leaving. The \"reason\" was they were training new personnel. As a consumer, it is not my place to deal with training during happy hours, this is a management issue. As a patron, with a low expectation I didn't think my experience could get lower than before . I will most likely not return."}
{"text":"Bar Louie has the best sliders i've ever had! My favorite is definitely the salmon sliders! Not to mention their amazing deals during their happy hour. All flatbread and some appetizers are half off! I recommend going during their happy hour and trying a few different items. The atmosphere is also very fun and comfortable. 10/10 recommend~"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service and the food is amazing! My friends and I love coming here. Not to mention great location!"}
{"text":"Lovely patio with full bar, $2 drinks all day Sunday, clean bathroom, and decent chicken gumbo....what more can a girl ask for?"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Took an hour and half for food. Wouldn't get a manager when asked. Took 45 minutes to speak to a manager. Took 30 minutes everytime we ordered drinks. Food was good but will never be back"}
{"text":"We hosted an event at Bar Louie and Melvin and Mary went above and beyond to assist our attendees and myself. Great food specials and drinks throughout the night. Our attendees had great response to the event and we will love to come back in the future!   Try to mussels and quesadilla from the apps menu! The Deep Eddy martinis are phenomenal!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat before a Coyote's game! The happy hour prices for drinks are apps are a great deal."}
{"text":"The first thing I do when someone says \"we are going to this place X\" is look it up on yelp. So when my bf said \"we are going to Bar Louie\" I did just that and was totally turned off because of the reviews and didn't want to go, but we were meeting friends, so it was what it was.  Maybe it was the low expectations, but I thought it was really good. Our server was nice and prompt delivering things. I got the blackened fish sandy and the bf got the chicken sandy and we really liked both of them. Our friends were also happy with the food.  I see what people are saying about the crowd. It definitely sways a little older (we are mid 30's) but honestly it was more mixed than anything. It was loud and fun and a good place for cocktails and a bite."}
{"text":"This place definitely does not do food like kittens do cute..    So we got the Luis(?) basically a shaved meat sandwich with mac and cheese subbed for fries and the trio of chips and dip.  The chips were salted VERY inconsistently - some chips didn't have any salt and some would burn your tongue it's so salty.  They are also very stingy with the sauces - they only fill the cups about halfway with the salsa, guac and queso.  The flavor of the salsa and queso weren't bad but the guacamole was basically a hacked up avocado with a few tomato pieces in it.  Bland.    The sandwich wasn't the worst, but was hard to eat.  The veggies are arranged on top like its supposed to be open faced and the shape of the roll also makes it kind of ambiguous.  I tried both ways, eating open faced style and tucking the veggies inside and biting sideways but either way its kind of messy.  Anyway, the meat is barely seasoned at all.  An au jus or some kind of aoli sauce or really ANYTHING would have helped it a lot.  The mac and cheese wasn't bad.  The sauce got a bit chunky when it started cooling off but otherwise the flavor isn't bad and they didn't overcook the pasta.  So the food was not awful but not very good and at about ten bucks a pop, I'd rather go to about a million other places so I think I probably won't be back.  I'm seriously getting flashbacks from a couple of those chips.. (not the good kind either)"}
{"text":"Food was really good, bartenders were eye candy. Lots of fun, espically thursday night."}
{"text":"Third strike for me when it comes to Bar Louie.  First time we went here it was all good, the next time not so much, with terrible service but always good food.  The third time we literally say ourselves as the sign said on which was a slow night.  Nobody ever came to wait on us for 15 min, so we just left and went elsewhere.  The last time we went the food was good, service was okay, but we ordered shots and I must say when I got back to the table from taking a call I thought someone in our group had drank half my shot, watered down and pathetic pour.  Then the bill came and they fucked up the pricing of the drinks.  Food is great but the service seriously drives me away from this place."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise for a new place.  Food and service were both excellent.  I had the grilled veggie wrap, which I really liked a lot."}
{"text":"Bar Louie is your typical, sterile, generic chain restaurant / bar. Definitely something you'd expect to find in a \"lifestyle center\" where every restaurant is only slightly different than the others. It has no ambiance and is decorated like you would expect it to be with black and white photos that are probably hanging in every other Bar Louie you'd visit.   I'm giving 3 stars because the service was alright and the appetizers were good. Our server was cool and made fun of me for saying I didn't want another beer and then brought me one anyway. I wasn't upset - I really wanted another one but I was trying not to get sloshed - and hey, I wasn't paying so.... SURE more beer!   Their margaritas are exactly how everyone else has described them. Terrible. Beer list sucks, as you'd expect.   I can't imagine how uncool this place must be on Friday and Saturday nights. I'm guessing it would be full of white hats with \"COCKS\" printed on them and really bad tribal arm bands.   So yeah, go on a weeknight and leave before 8pm and you'll probably be fine."}
{"text":"Food is alright. Always have to wait close to 10 mins. for the waiter to come and infinity for the food to come out. Servers are always standing around talking and not doing their jobs. Recently, I came in after 10pm with 4 adults and 1 minor. They refused to serve us even after WE SAT DOWN! Told us that they card every customer after 10pm. They have NEVER CARD any of my group ONCE! I spoke to the manager on duty (Jonathan), and he said as far as he has been working there, that's the rule. There was a few customers there that night. All the server's clearly saw that I walked in with a child, yet no one came up to inform us their \"after 10 PM rule\". No signs in front at all. I will never dine in at Bar Louie again. Poor customer service. Not to mention, the server always asked what temperature I want for the burgers and they NEVER come out the correct tempt."}
{"text":"The words \"epic fail\" get thrown around a lot these days....but I really feel like they apply in this situation.  We went on Friday, April 2 and arrived at 5:10pm.  It was busy, but not crowded....no waiting for a table.  Half price apps and drinks -- we ordered at 5:20.  The food (just appetizers, mind you...) didn't arrive till almost 6pm.  Drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow.  We placed one order for 6 draft beers at 6:15...they arrived at 6:52.  *37 minutes for beer.*  By 7:00, we were canceling food orders which we'd given up on after waiting almost an hour.  We just wanted to leave.  Instead of comping anything, they added 18% gratuity to each of our bills.  Uhhhh yeah.  Thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back.   We finally were able to leave around 7:30.  Bar Louie:  You are dead to me."}
{"text":"This place looks cool, that's as far as you'll get is looks if it's busy. When It's packed it sucks as there is no \"hostess\" just \"wherever you can find a table\" I was told, so people are camping out everywhere hanging out by tables that \"look like they are finishing.\" LAME."}
{"text":"Wow! My girls and I come every Tuesday for $5 burger night! It's always so busy- which duh $5 burgers! Each time we get mediocre service and our burgers are usually never made properly. Today we had Charlie!! He did incredible! Checked on us regularly despite the busy crowd, made sure our burgers were made right, and brought each of us our sides of ranch! We were so impressed by him!! Before this visit we thought about switching to another Tuesday night girls night spot- but thanks to Charlie we will be here for good!"}
{"text":"This place is solid but nothing special.  Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Bar Louie is the physical space which is quite modern and clean in its appearance. Views of the water and city are also fantastic.  Now for the actual food: upscale bar food that is good, but nothing to write home about. My meal included nachos as an appetizer and Mac&Cheese for the entree.    Nachos were the standard gringo fare that is typical of nacho dishes in this part of the country: salty chips, bland salsa and blah guac.  The Mac and cheese, however, was heavenly.    Service for our large group was on point.  The price was a bit too steep for my tastes given the quantity and quality of food I sampled.  Honestly, unless you're in Station Square or the immediate area, I wouldn't go here.  There are far better bars in Pittsburgh with more character and tastier food that I'd consider."}
{"text":"Went with a group after a pirate game.   Great for larger groups.  Service was fast and efficient.   The waiter Algerone said he was brand new.   Would have thought he's been doing it for years.  He was wonderful.  Personable and pleasant even with the busy chaos.  Kept everything straight and even split checks with no hesitation.   They are fortunate to have him on staff.    Food is good,  reasonably priced , consistent and nice variety."}
{"text":"Cocktails were excellent and the bartender was very personable. It was a very chill atmosphere and the drinks were fantastic! The burgers were cooked perfectly--we had a great time when we visited.   The menu was original and presented a wide variety of options that could satisfy any level of appetite, from slightly hungry to starving. The cocktails were creative and original. I recommend the Royally Buzzed cocktail; I've never had anything quite like it. It's slightly pricey, but contains ALL of the liquor and is definitely worth it. Highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Only giving 2 stars because the wait staff was awesome, otherwise it would one star. The food was terrible, drinks were so so. I would definitely consider hiring a new cook or kitchen manager. Ordered chicken tacos that took over 30 minutes to come out and it came out cold. The chicken was like ground up chicken, brown avocados and the black beans were like they came out of a can. Not impressed by the food but would still visit for drinks, appetizers not bad."}
{"text":"It was the first time that I went to this location.  We sat outside and it was a beautiful night.  I had the BBQ Burger with fries.  For the price of the burger I expected something much better.  It was a very thin burger when it came to the meat.  As a whole it looked large but that was only because of what they piled on top of it.  In addition, their drinks are expensive!  Just one cocktail could run between $10-$12 and they aren't very large.  Our waitress spent more time talking to her friends at the next table than actually tending to our needs.  There are enough restaurants at the Waterfront that I don't know that I will come back here."}
{"text":"I am a regular here and always have great food, drinks, and service. Very friendly staff and a great atmosphere. Sitting on the back patio with a bucket of beer is one of my favorite ways to pass a Wednesday night. Miranda never makes me wait too long on another beer or on anything I need!"}
{"text":"Seriously the worst. This is the third time I've been to Bar Louie and it's progressively gotten worse. It took 40 minutes to get 2 sandwiches to go (we were 2 of 7 people in the restaurant). I finally got a bartenders attention who went to check on our order. When we got it, it wasn't correct and was missing ranch. Another 10 minutes had passed before the manager brought out my ranch. At this point it had been 55 minutes and not one person had been by to close out our tab. I walked outside at this point. Apparently the manager wanted to take care of our tab which was nice but would not have been necessary if they had their act together. Not going back."}
{"text":"I had been here twice in December of 2013 and didn't enjoy it much....Food or service..  My visit yesterday for $5.00 martinis and 1/2 price appetizers was much better! The food was good, fresh and hot. We had the chips with 3 dips, buffalo chicken flatbread and a shrimp crostini type dish. The martinis were a decent size and very good.  This may become a regular Wednesday spot!"}
{"text":"I ordered some pretty decent barbecue that hit the mark for the day. We did wait about 10 minutes before our server came to bring us water and they were is probably only five people in the restaurant around lunchtime on a weekday. The amount of time that it took for the food to be delivered was average and the staff was not overly friendly but still attentive."}
{"text":"I won't go back there again. First it took over 45 minutes to make a hamburger, then I ordered cheddar cheese and got provolone and finally when I went to bite into it there was a piece of paper in my hamburger yuck."}
{"text":"Do NOT go to this location unless you're okay with eating old, stale food. I was served a burger with mold on the buns - now, who wants to eat that?!   I live downtown just a block away from Bar Louie so I ordered a burger for pick-up - I got home and bit into a moldy burger! I called the restaurant and spoke with the manager who did not seem at all alarmed and didn't even offer a refund! The manager did, however, ask that I write down her number and send her pictures - well, while we're sharing... here they are for everyone to see.   Since neither food quality nor customer service are a priority at this location you're better off going to one of the other restaurants on West 6th. And, if you're still in the mood for a burger I would recommend Johnny's Little Bar down the street."}
{"text":"Food is good. We were here on Tuesday, our server was OK, the Adam Levine looking guy. Overall it could've been better, friend didn't get his bleu cheese and I didn't get my water."}
{"text":"We used the private room for our 3 year old's birthday party (~15 adults and 15 kids). The food was great and our server was awesome- very attentive and good with the kids. There was plenty of space for the kids to run around and adults to enjoy themselves too."}
{"text":"Got their apparently they have open seating but did not know that stood  there for five minutes looking around finally was told open seating sat down I got water right a way in 10 to 15 minutes later hostess showed up took my appetizer order when the appetizer got there which was just some chips and salsa and the chips were stale and Cold asked for new chips by the time someone got around to it my food with their waited three minutes after I got my food that was getting cold because I could not eat it because I had no silverware at that time we decided to leave when we sat down the table wasn't anything clean to start out with"}
{"text":"Stop by 6/28/2018 around 7:30pm. I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza. It had very little chicken an way too much blue cheese dressing to make up for lack of toppings. Also the women's bathroom was really filthy dirty. There was a hostess in there with me who I mentioned it to, and she said \"yea it's ok as long as you don't sit\"...ewww wrong answer! Why not help get someone to clean it? Never going there again. Left with a stomach ache"}
{"text":"They literally brought out the sliders without the crispy onions and said they would bring them later. They did bring a small side of them but not until after we had eaten the sliders. We mentioned it to our waitress and she blamed the manager and no one apologized at all."}
{"text":"Took my son to $1 burger night on Tuesday. Good bargain for a quick, filling dinner. Open seating and service was excellent!"}
{"text":"When the ratio to wait staff to diners is 3:1 you'd think you could get service!!!  Nothing erks me more then seeing idol wait staff and hungry patrons. I very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first. I came here on Saturday ay 6pm. Almost none of the diners had food on their table and many of them didn't have drinks in the 15 minutes I was there I counted 9 waitress again I counted 9 waitresses and not a one of them came over to our table to get even a drink order. Just from the looks of it I could tell staying any longer would be a total train wreck. So after 15 minutes of waitress counting we left with empty bellies."}
{"text":"Had a really unfortunate experience at Bar Louie tonight, definitely will not be back. Sharing this because there are a lot of choices in the north shore, and this place should be embarrassed.   Let's start with the service and the restaurant itself. Absolutely disgusting. There is no hostess so you kinda seat yourself. No problem but maybe put a sign up or something so people aren't just waiting there.   Floor was sticky and there was trash everywhere. I get it was a busy day earlier, but at least make an attempt to keep up with it. Bathrooms were also absolutely disgusting. Waitress took about 15 minutes to even acknowledge us. Ordered drinks. 20 minutes later, nothing. We ended up going to the bar to get some waters ourselves in the meantime.   Ordered a Moscow mule, which, after taking forever to even get there, tasted like chemicals. Everyone who worked there seemed to be standing around. When our drinks did not come, we went up to the bar as previously mentioned, and the bartenders were more interested in flirting than caring about the customers. We waited there several minutes before either acknowledged us, or stopped feeding French fries to each other to notice we were there.   Food took a very long time, and the restaurant was not crowded at all. We ordered nachos. I think they would have been okay if they weren't cold. Obviously they'd been sitting out for a while before coming to our table. Ordered a chicken sandwich which was burnt. No one else seemed thrilled with their food in our party, everyone was just hungry so we are it.   Not a positive experience, they should be ashamed of how they treat their customers, I'm surprised this place is still open. Plenty of other north shore bars, there's no reason to go here."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to have a drink in the university area!! Good food, good drinks, and good atmosphere. All specialty burgers are $5 on Tuesdays. My favorite so far is the Grand Lemondrop Martini and the Backyard BBQ burger. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"I went here with a few of my friends for their grand opening week. They had $2 martinis and 1/2 off appetizers from March 18-25 and it was between the times of 6-9pm only. I thought that it would be a great marketing event but come to think of it, how are they making any money. At most, a martini cost about $10 at least at Bar Louie but to charge it for just $2, it seems such a big drop so the place is like losing money.   We ordered their pot stickers, shrimp skewers, quesadilla, and pasta for food. The pot stickers was a bit overcooked to me and the sauce that came with it was not anything different either. The skewers (shrimp) was cooked perfectly but I felt that their mango salsa salad could have done a little better. It seemed lifeless on the plate and none of the flavors were combined into one. I wish they could have tossed it vs. serving it like that. Their tuscan pasta was tasteless to me, so it didn't do any good.   As far as the place goes, it looks just like any Bar Louie is but much bigger and has a patio area. There wasn't a hostess at the hour so we pretty much seat ourselves. At first, it was hard to look for a table since most of them were taken but we basically just sat at a table that just needed to be cleaned up. Service was alright for that day considering it was packed.   I think this would be a great place to hang out in the summer time if you're ever around the area in Westlake since they have that good size patio area."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch. Ordered the bourbon burger and fish tacos. The burger was tasty but the size was too small. The fish tacos was good. It comes with rice and beans and guac and salsa. I wouldn't order the burgers unless they make a bigger patty. The service was good and the inside is nicely decorated."}
{"text":"Currently sitting in bar Louie in Legacy village.. I've been here several times and by now you would think I would've learned my lesson.. I ordered a drink and it took almost 20 minutes for someone to come tell they didn't have the alcohol to make my drink.. Then some how we ended up with 3 servers! But still managed to have no silverware on our table and two napkins..my girlfriend and I both ordered burgers and tots.. Almost 40 minutes for a BURGER. only for our food to come and hers is cold.. She sent it back and half of the tots are warm and the others are cold. How did that happen?? I don't understand how we have 3 servers and nothing has been right..."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times and I always leave here satisfied! The strawberry margarita is very good here! I had Angela as our server and she was very nice and friendly! Good drinks and service!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink and a much better option for dinner or snacks than all of the other bars on West 6th. The atmosphere is fun and comfortable and the staff is very friendly. This is definately one of my favorite places to come downtown. Great happy hour, dollar burgers on Tuesdays, and dollar beers on Wednesdays. Whats not to love?"}
{"text":"Just had a holiday party here and it is great for large gatherings and after work get togethers. Plenty of community tables for easy conversation and the service was very good. Happy hour is from 5-7 and the prices are hard to beat. A little pricey outside of happy hour but in line with the rest of North Shore."}
{"text":"This place was great! I went here with a couple of friends and we had an awesome time. They had a live dj who was taking requests and the place was still packed at 10pm on a Saturday night. The drinks were well worth the money and we shared a couple of the flatbreads which i enjoyed. The buffalo chicken flatbread was my favorite. Definitely coming back for more. Best bar on the west side of Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is a Bar Louie and it's in one of the most touristy/family-friendly parts of town, so it's not ever going to be an extremely highly rated experience for me personally. I went here with my boyfriend for a friend's birthday a few weeks back however, and I can say that this location (as opposed to the nasty one in Station Square) is pretty okay. The restaurant is spacious inside with plenty of potential to expand outdoors during the warmer months. We had excellent table service from a very nice server who did a good job keeping everyone's drinks full. It was dollar beer night, but all of the options on special were unfortunately not palatable if you like good beer. I would be much more inclined to come back for a beer night if BL rotated one (just one!) nice craft option in with the others. Plenty of people will still choose the piss of course, but ones like me would be so happy. The free chips and dip appetizer I ordered was great at least, particularly the guacamole. If I ever was in the area I would come back and get that again and possibly a drinkable beer during happy hour, since those prices looked good."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some Sunday Lunch with a friend and I have mixed reviews. I liked the seating, great patio etc. The food was good, burgers and some different stuff served in a very cute way. I guess what annoyed me the most was the staff, our waitress Kim had a Very High pitch voice and kept calling me \"Girl\" thought it just might be her, but when she forgot that we asked for lemon 3x's, another waitress stopped by and she referred to me as \"Girl\" I'm not an old lady ~ but Im certainly Not A GIRL. Advise your staff its Not cute to call a woman over the age of 17~ GIRL!"}
{"text":"If you would like to be treated as if you are an annoyance and a bother, this is your place.  We arrived today at Bar Louie for lunch and we were greeted by the waitress who instructed us to sit anywhere.  She followed us out to our table to take our drink orders and that was practically the last we saw of her.    The menus are sitting on top of the table.  All five of them had major dried food stuff smeared all over them.  When I handed her the soiled menus, she just laughed and said \"oh that happens all the time.\"  Well clearly.  I wonder if it ever occurred to her to wipe them off?  After approximately 15 minutes of sitting and waiting for her to return to place our order, we had to get up and go find her.  At this point, we counted 14 people in the entire restaurant, most of whom were drinking at the bar.  Nearly 25 minutes passed after we placed our order and again, no sign of our waitress.  My husband got up to go find someone and several minutes later he found her inside the restaurant.  Several more minutes passed and she \"slowly\" ( I emphasize this word as that was her M.O on everything) brought our food to the table.  Not a word from her about us waiting over 45 minutes from start to finish for our food.   The food was OK, nothing to cause us to ever return here.  It was one of the few times in my life that I did not tip a waitress."}
{"text":"Their \"dollar\" burgers aren't really dollar burgers. Every topping is an extra charge. My girlfriend and I got two \"dollar\" burgers with a few toppings, two beers, and a side of tater tots. The bill came to $31. Very overpriced for mediocre food and mediocre service."}
{"text":"Came here for the free Vet dinner or lunch on the eve before Veterans day.  They must be short staffed.  45 mins for one coke, 53 min for bad watermelon Margaretta.  After 60 min we left.  I left $11 dollars on the table for my drinks.  Won't be back.  Thanks Bar Louie for trying to thank us Vets. Sorry but the bad service over shadowed the free meal!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Bar Louie, a number of times.  I live closest to the one in Legacy Village, work near the one on West 6th and have also visited the one in Columbus.  I've never had a bad meal or experience at Bar Louie.  If I go for lunch, which I did before this review, I normallly get the hummus, tabouleh small plate, which is a huge portion for $8 and comes with sliced cucumbers, warm flatbread and yogurt sauce.   On this visit, I noticed from the menu that the tabouleh has been replaced with tapenade....didn't really have a taste for olives, so I ordered the turkey, ham and brie sandwich accompanied by tater tots.  The sandwich arrived on a french sub roll that had been sliced and toasted inside out (a bit strange, and also made for a really crunchy sandwich).  There were generous portions of thick sliced turkey & ham and nice slices of brie, accompanied by a blackberry jam spread.  The tater tots were standard frozen variety.   All in all this was a pretty decent meal, but will stick to some of my other favorites, going forward."}
{"text":"This place is just horrible. The food isn't even good and the wait for it is even worse. They are incridibly slow. I watched my quesadilla sit under the heat lamp for more than 15 minutes and by the time I got it the underside was soggy. My friend got his food 20 minutes after I go mine. I came here twice and both times it was bad."}
{"text":"Came for Tuesday burger night, paid $4 for my food, and the beer was gigantic. What really made it though was our server, Brea. Super nice and friendly, she was there right when we needed her, and she laughed at my corny joke. Really a good time."}
{"text":"I love the hummus and the Effen Good Martini. The bartenders and servers are all great. I go here all of the time and I've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I tried going here again last night and it was so busy that my friend and I decided to go elsewhere since we had purchased movie tickets and there was no way we would be getting served in an hour due to the amount of people that were there on a Friday night at 7.   So... I tried again tonight at 6:30 on a Saturday with my husband.  We lucked out and found a small table (the only one available in the restaurant) for a drink before our 7:00 dinner reservation at Brio.  We ordered a beer and a glass a wine and it took 15 minutes before we got our beer and wine.  The irritating part was that we saw it sitting at the bar for a while before our waiter recognized that it was there.  I now feel like I have given this place numerous occasions to make it right and it just doesn't work for me."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  Our bartender was unprofessional and lazy.  I would recommend going next door to Burgatory or Southern Tier."}
{"text":"I stay at the Marriott by here and it's a better option than hotel food.  Nothing special about this place but some nights have attractive women hanging out by the bar.  Meatballs and the italian beef flat bread are decent.  The mac n cheese sucks."}
{"text":"The place is actually super nice , perfect to host any event! I wish I would have been there for happy hour , but the food we ordered tasted great and the presentation was outstanding ! Deff made me feel like I was eating at a fancy restaurant !  The prices are a little high ... but they have amazing happy hour deals !   Also the spicy margarita was perfection !!!"}
{"text":"I agree with Susan. The service is terrible!! I ordered a Titos vodka and club and they delivered me a watered down drink. When I questioned the alcohol content, the bartender told me that she ran out of Titos. What??!!! Really!!!??? So had I not noticed, she would have never mentioned it and still charged me the full price without offering me another option. Wow. Ok...so I sent it back and gave them another try at a Moscow Muel with Kettle One. Well guess What? They ran out of ginger beer and when i asked for more, because i didnt taste it, they AGAIN, did the same thing. \"We ran out of ginger beer.\" Yeah...ok.  avoid this place at ALL Cost. Young bartenders with TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and ZERO skills."}
{"text":"The food was disgusting. The place was filthy. No one ate their food and there were no apologies, no offering to remove anything from the bill and extra charges on the bill. Maybe it's a good bar if you're interested in drinking . Do not eat here."}
{"text":"I went here after a Steeler's game, so it was packed and there was about a 35 minute wait. To be honest, this is one of the most average places I've been to. The bartenders gave very mediocre service, however once we were seated at a table the service was a little better. I got the mac n cheese and it was okay- nothing to write home about and pretty bland.    I'm sure the crowd had a huge impact on my experience and I hope that it's better when they are as busy."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Bar Louie.  My visit this past weekend was less than stellar.  The menu has changed and the quality of the food has changed.  My daughters and I visited this location because it was convenient.  We were seated immediately in the back room, in the middle of a large party.  We placed our order.  My daughters ordered the quesadillas and I ordered the turkey burger.  The food arrived within a decent window of time.  My burger was a bit off, kind of rubbery and tasteless.  I've had the turkey burger at Bar Louie before, and it was much better.  The accompanying tots were just ok.  Our server was just ok, as well.  All in all, I probably won't visit this location again, anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for a late lunch today. Worst decision I have ever made. My boyfriend and I started off by ordering lettuce wraps. The lettuce was clearly not washed. There was dirt on the lettuce. Then to top it off, we spotted an insect on my boyfriend's plate. Not sure if it came from the napkin, or the food that he just ate. Either way that is absolutely unacceptable. Told our server, and all he said was \"great experience so far\" sarcastically. I mean really? Do I have to make a scene in order for our server to realize how disgusting that is? Needless to say, I will never go to this Bar Louie ever again. Worst dining experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar their is distinct funk smell... like a dirty well or like they need flush/clean their draining system... the bathrooms smelled like urine. Also noticed the bar tender cutting up oranges put the new oranges into the container and just pulled the day before she label off and tipped off the orange bucket with fresh oranges... makes me wonder how long the bottom oranges had been there..."}
{"text":"$56 for cold wings, a soggy salad, and two watered down drinks. Not to mention terrible service. Stay far, far away."}
{"text":"I have been going here since they opened and always have a great time. I especially love the $1 burgers on Tuesday and $1 beers on Wednesday!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The veggie wrap is my staple and my husband dreams about the drunken fish sandwich"}
{"text":"I was, prior to visiting, a little disappointed that I never got a chance to visit D'Arcy McGee's before it was replaced by Bar Louie. After hearing from my employer and his brother-in-law that it was not such a great place, that disappointment faded.  I decided to visit Bar Louie in early November while I was at Tempe Marketplace to watch a movie. I walked through the front door and was not greeted by either a hostess or any other employee. I traipsed toward the bar and was also not greeted by either of the two bartenders behind the bar. I continued forward and finally found a nice young lady whom I asked about seating. She retrieved a server and I requested to be sat on the patio. The patio was empty and I chose a corner table. My waiter informed me that he would be right back and would bring me a menu.  After bringing a menu back, I inquired as to whether or not there were any beer specials ongoing. I was dismayed to find out that their refrigeration system was on the fritz and they only had three beers available: New Castle Brown Ale and two run-of-the-mill, piss-poor domestics. I chose the New Castle.  After receiving my drink, I ordered from their very straightforward menu after asking the server what his personal favorite menu item was. The \"Four Tacos Plato\" with blackened fish was selected, and off went the server.  I received my food in a very timely manner and it was piping hot. Everything tasted fresh and it looked well-constructed.  My only complaint was the portion size. The tacos were listed under the \"Large Plate\" section of the menu, but the tacos themselves were quite small. They were more reminiscent of street tacos as opposed to restaurant fare. Regardless, the service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable, the food was quite good and the atmosphere (at least from where I was sitting; on the outside looking in) seemed warm.  All-in-all, I can recommend it to others, but I can't say that it is a five-star establishment."}
{"text":"Great location for game days.  I was down for work and stopped in during lunch.  Busy place with great service and atmosphere.  Ate their version of Chicken Tacos and had a beer while sitting at the bar. Bartender was very attentive and wouldn't even let me finish my beer before asking if i would like another (i like this btw!).  Overall, awesome place and look forward to stopping in when i go to Pirates/Steelers games."}
{"text":"Everywhere I travel I end up at a Bar Louie for some reason. Stopped by for Brunch. ON A SATURDAY!!!! Happy day. Had the Hangover Helper. Think I might steal the skillet so I can have a CSI unit tell me the exact portions of everything in it....phenomenal. Shout out to Kurt who helped me pick."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to meet here before a movie. She was excited to try the \"Baked Mac & Cheese and I had the BLT flat bread. I actually enjoyed my meal BUT when my friend recieved her's, it is not baked! We called the waiter and told him, he said it is, no- it's boiled! I'm used to baked in the oven and it having a golden top bubbling. It was terrible! Disappointing! The service was a okay... I think I would just go back and try cocktails and not make it a place to dine."}
{"text":"Corita is awesome!! Such a friendly waitress. She made us a Paralyzer.  and helped us with a charge cord for our phone! Seriously the best experience. Mac and Cheese was amazing!"}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour on Friday.  Waited 1/2 hours for our drinks (table of 4) which the waitress spoon fed to us one at a time!  The drinks were not good at all!  Loud raucous music, could barely hear what other people were saying.  Atmosphere is like a big open barn, the name to me implied more of a cozy quieter place.  Will not be back.  Paid our bill and went to Houlihan's right next door.  Had a great time there!"}
{"text":"We went to Bar louie on 2-26-09, for happy hour --- (between going to Yardhouse, and The Grape - Blue Martini was way too packed and annoying!) - the day they were doing the free luigi sandwich too!  There weren't too many people there, so thats kinda weird that the only other person to review Bar Louie was there at the same day/time!    Anyway, the bartender was super friendly... and the happy hour prices were awesome.  We didn't get a Luigi -- but it looked tastey.  We only stayed for one drink, but will definately come back next time.  :)"}
{"text":"We usually come here for their Tuesday night specials. The $5 burger nights are totally worth it, and they have a good selection of beer. Their outdoor patio area is nice too, and provides a pleasant atmosphere even if it's hot outside. Their desserts are not bad either. Overall a very good place!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! Everything I've tried here is delicious :) I'll almost always get the BBQ burger because it's amazing but this time I got the BBQ salad and it was just as great. I love their happy hour as well, drafts are super cheap!"}
{"text":"OK food high prices service is slow not as good as other locations that I have been to. I would skip this one nothing positive worth mentioning"}
{"text":"Tuesday's are 5.00 burgers starting at 5. This is our third time here right before seeing a movie. Seems like if your not here early all the seats are gone. First 2 times here the service has been mediocre, we will see how it this time. It always starts out good but as soon as we get our food it goes downhill. Starting with having with waiting for your server to come back so you can ask for them to bring you some mustard. Don't know why they don't do it to begin with."}
{"text":"Server was excellent and very attentive. We were there on a Saturday night primarily to here the free concert in the green space. My companions first choice, the chicken flatbread, was dry and inedible. She ordered something else which was \"O.K.\" She had two glasses of beer ($7.95 each). Don't remember which kind as I am not a drinker. My wife had the fish sandwich with fries which she described as \"right out of the freezer\". I had the Philly sandwich which, while had a decent flavor, would have been helped with some more sauce, onions and mushrooms. Fries were nothing great, definitely out of the freezer as well. For bar food I guess it passed muster but pricey and Wendy's serves a better burger. I wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"Legit happy hour. 2nd to none next to Kona. We arrived at 6:45 and our waiter was cool enough to cram our last minute order.  If you're in the area for Happy hour, hit this place. Great beer selection as well.  LEGIT-NESS"}
{"text":"Went to Bar Louie late night on a random Tuesday. Nothing is more unwelcoming than the entire staff more concerned with closing duties than your presence at 1am. The bartender was cold and unfriendly. It happened to be $1.00 burger night, more like $6.00 after you add tomato, onion, cheese, etc. The best kicker, the menu states you can add fries for \"a little bit more,\" that little bit is $4.00, a nice little surprise when you get your bill.   Beers and drinks are a little pricey, shots are outragously expensive. Food was decent, service was below average. Bottom Line: If you're showing up for a special or a deal be on your toes, you'll end up paying for it somehow."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. I asked the bartender a simple question of why this place is called Louie and like a little bitch went to the manager and told him to cut bus off. Truly unprofessional. Guess Trump won this place over."}
{"text":"This place is a nightmare. I can't even call it service. There's always a wait even at an empty bar. The bartenders are busy throwing beer caps and chatting with each other to even acknowledge customers. When they do finally greet you, it's with an attitude. Don't dare ask a question either, they eye roll and bs answer is a huge inconvenience to these people. I found this place to be slow when it first opened but thought I'd give it a few more try's here and there in hopes it was an off day. After yesterday's visit I can say we won't be going back. Ever. Repeatedly bad/slow service, cranky servers and an all around bad vibe of feeling like your putting someone out when asking for a drink or a food order. Don't waste your money and especially your time."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a client. Both of our meals were cold and service was horrific. This location is going straight to the gutter. Time for a mangament change and maybe actually clean the restrooms.. Not coming back until they get this zoo back to how it operated when they first opened"}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour! Spinach-artichoke dip, boneless hot buffalo wings, Thai chicken flatbread, buffalo chicken flatbread and calamari were all delicious - and did I mention half-price!! On Tuesday they offer 1/2 pound hamburgers for $1, all day. All of the staff are friendly, but a special thanks to Carla and Lindsey for making us feel so welcome! If we lived in Cleveland, this would definitely be our go-to place!!"}
{"text":"Awful.  Some random girl sat next to me and didn't pay her bar tab, I called manager over and they made me pay when I didn't even know this girl.  She just sat next to me and gave me her number When I gave it to the manager they wouldn't take it."}
{"text":"We came here for a bachelor/bachelorette party in the reserved basement room. The service was impeccable, no one ever had an empty glass. The food was great. Our server Alejandro took such good care of our group. Everyone loved it and had such a great time. Would highly recommend reserving this room it has tables and comfortable couches, a big screen tv, music, and nice decor."}
{"text":"If pedestrian over priced food is what your into then this is the place. Ordered cheese burger medium (some pink) and got unseasoned well done ground meat patty. Oh, and please bring a bug light or fly swat cause you have to compete with them for you food. The water was great."}
{"text":"Bar Louie has a huge amount of space. There are some pool tables and dart board. Service is fine, drinks a little pricey, and the place doesn't get packed even on a Saturday night.  It's not really my idea of fun.  It's an upscale club feeling for people who are too mature to go out to a real club.  The music and the clientele saw their best days a few years ago.  On a nice day however, they have a big patio and a decent view of the city."}
{"text":"Terrible. Don't waste your time if there's a Pirate game. We got here a few hours before the game and it was busy as we expected. First off they don't have a host and the place is packed. We found a manager and asked about seating and he barely even looked at me and said if it's empty we can sit there. Really? We waited 20 minutes before anyone even greeted us, once greeted we never got a drink order and had to go to the bar ourselves. It wasn't until we waited 45 mins and found a different manager was when we got our order in. Multiple tables around us left and others were waited on after arriving after us. I didn't even get my food yet and I'm leaving this for you all."}
{"text":"While I miss Darcy McGee's, this standard, unoffensive bar is a decent, low-key, if a little shinier option at Tempe Marketplace. The crowd leans a little older than Cadillac, San Felipe's or D&B. I just went to catch up with some friends over a beer or two. The staff was friendly and attentive and I like that they still had specials going on a Friday night. They had live music going, but I actually didn't realize it was live until we got up to leave and I saw the band. The patio looked nice, but it was a rainy night, so we just stayed in. It overlooks the parking lot which isn't too pretty, but it's good for people watching everyone coming and leaving the Marketplace!"}
{"text":"I went here for my 22nd Birthday on the Saturday following my actual birthday. I went with my boyfriend, his two friends, my friend from a previous job,  and my college theatre friends. We were seated quickly and began ordering right away. I had their spinach and artichoke dip, which is what I usually get if they offer it anywhere. :P It was delicious. I got something else which I can't remember what it was, and the cocktail that was pink with the pineapple slice in it. ( I had two and for the life of me can't remember what it was called. :() My boyfriend paid for food, I paid for my drinks, and the prices were pretty reasonable. :) Overall, not a bad place to eat and spend time with friends!"}
{"text":"Love at first glance... This place has potential, lots of potential. Made a plan to stop in on a preview night. $1 martinis, & free appitizer, good call on my part.  The place was lively, but still room to get in and get somewhat promptly served. A profesionals observation was that all the bartenders were hot servers. management made bartenders, I thought this cause, they are all hot, they took the menus away each and everytime, even when you asked to keep it or have another, with each order... yep gone... snatched from my martini soaked fingers. Leave the menus with all that great food and an amazing list of specialty cocktails.... for the Love Of God dont take my menu!!!! The other tell was none of the \"Hot bartenters\" couldnt remember an order and they constantly asked twice or even 3 times to everyone in my area. Lorin was the exception, and she was super sweet, friendly, and wanted to make sure I got EXCELLENT Service. I did, thanks Lorin! The Food, well my Free appitizer arrived withen a few (2) minutes of ordering it. I know it wasnt at its best but it was still great, Tempura Shrimp with 3 sauces on the side, and free. My first martini arrived about the same time. Juicy wet and ICE COLD just the way I like em. Second Martini was a bit more dry and effen great!!! cucumber, mint, lime and more, another hit. Still hungry I orderd the Blue Louie Burger. This burger with bacon, blue cheese, spinach and wing sauce was FRIKKEN AMAZING a solid 10 and I cant wait to have another please. I really like what they did with the place and good riddence to that ol' Darcy place. Open with a great patio and center bar, they place has a nice vibe, super good looks, and its easy to dance to. er... I digress. I cant wait to return and that alone gets 5 stars, but a solid menu, great service, nice atmosphere, and great specials... you had me at specials, make this place a solid must try. GOOD LUCK and may the third time be the charm, Welcome to the Hood Louie!!!!"}
{"text":"Great bar service!! Fast service and delicious martini choices. Definitely check it out if you are in the area for a game. Ask for Ariel!"}
{"text":"Went with a small group for lunch. Group of 7 when it was not busy. Service friendly but food late in coming out, lukewarm when arrived and two of our group the food did not arrive until we asked where it was and then it arrived after the rest of us were already done eating. Would not recommend ."}
{"text":"I've been to Bar Louie so many times, and it's always delicious! I love their burgers, fish and chips, flatbreads, and recently discovered they have amazing quesadillas. I also love their happy hour - super cheap drafts and a lot of the appetizers are half off. The patio area is great during the cooler seasons, but their inside seating is nice during the summer, too. They always have a great beer list (if you like IPAs, they have pretty good choices) and good cocktails as well. Last time I tried their Julio and Me Margarita and really enjoyed it - and I'm picky about margaritas lol :)"}
{"text":"Ok so let me start by saying I use to frequent the location in Virginia with no issues. From the time we sat down everything was a little off. Took around 10 minutes for someone to realize we were there and then he took our order for drinks. Not sure if he was just quiet but definitely not engaging. So......the cleanliness....the app plates and some silverware  were all dirty, menus all nasty and even the check holder was gross. When the meals came out, 3 of 4 were dropped off with no word spoken about the missing meal. 5 minutes later it got dropped of in a driveby....really not a friendly staff at all.  The food however was really  good. Weird thing they turned the lights off over our table 3 times and we had to say something to our server. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Ok service. Expensive menu. Mediocre Food.   I came here before a pre-season steeler's game and just missed happy hour. So my effin' good martini was $11. Too much for me. Having sad that, it was tasty & refreshing. I also ordered the thai chicken flatbread. I was disappointed. The peanut sauce was very strange tasting and it overtook every other flavor on the pizza. The chicken was barely there and there wasn't really any other toppings on it. I had to take most of the peanut sauce off to make it eatable. Our meal of three drinks, one flatbread and a sandwich came to $50. Outrageously overpriced for the quality of the food you are getting."}
{"text":"Decent food for Bar style burgers , apps and more. Service is always been friendly but seem understaffed at times. Nice atmosphere to hang out at with outside seating when it's nice out. A Trendy place."}
{"text":"OK, only go there to drink. I can't recommend the food unless you love Applebee's or Damons. Had the burger, unfortunately - tasted poorly the fries very over seasoned.  I guarantee everything is frozen &&& please do not order the coffee at  $2.99 It tasted like I was taking a flight from New York to Boston - Weak with no flavor.  #TryingToHardtobeCool."}
{"text":"I was there on a Thursday night. 7 to 9, it wasn't too crowded. Our server was excellent. Wish I could remember her name, long blonde hair. She was very efficient, came to the table frequently. When my friend and I had ordered the wrong dish, she replaced it without any fuss. We had the salmon sliders, one was a bit too spicy for me. They grill them with a spicy dry mix.  So a couple had just enough, one had a little bit too much!  We also had the hummus dip plate. Which was very good.  I did feel that my drink, the Berry mojito, was mostly ice. By it wasn't my goal to drink too much. So having it weak was OK.   This is a great after work drink spot. Or a great place to meet friends on the weekend."}
{"text":"I like Bar Louie a lot.  I'm a martini girl and they make them perfectly.  The voodoo chicken is very good and I like the staff a ton.  They remember me and are very friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Our server was more than accommodating, however the kitchen is terrible. Our food was sooo slow to arrive (table of 12, but greater than 1 hour after arrival, come on man). When the food came 1/2 the table got food and then 10 minutes later the other 1/2 came. And as much as you want kids to eat the right thing, the kid's menu grilled cheese came on....rye. What kid likes rye? They don't have white bread?!? What?  Come on man."}
{"text":"Stopped in here before a game and had a decent experience, mostly because the waitress was on point! She did a great job managing the outdoor section (which filled quickly after we sat down) on a cold night. The place was pretty crowded inside so she had a few issues getting our beers quickly.  We had the chicken lettuce wraps and a few beers, which adds up since it was the 'pregame menu'. The wraps were decent, but were a little too salty for our liking and the beers were on \"happy hour special\", but were still pretty expensive for miller lite. If you are looking for a place pre-heinz field or PNC park, not a bad stop, but I wouldn't head there otherwise."}
{"text":"The service here is decent for a busy weekday and the food is great. We got tots with our meal and they're on point.  Will look to come here on one dollar burger Tuesdays."}
{"text":"2 stars only for the music but everything else is terrible First there is no host, it's a open seating but no one is there to tell you  Second everything is dirty  The glass of water we got  The silverware  The plates  God help them  We found ourself eating in plastic  The portion are way to small for the price  I have been in bar Louie in Stl was AWSOME  But here it'sTerrible"}
{"text":"Horrible! Staff is super nice so it pains me to drop a 1 star, but honestly - beer was flat, beer had multiple pieces of dirt from dirty lines in bottom of my glass. The place is always empty and the bartenders stay at one end of bar chatting with servers and never check on you. I went like 10 minutes waiting to order and appetizer and finally just gave up. Take your hard earned $$ elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good classic bar food and then some.  $5 burgers every Tuesday after 5pm. Good cocktails. Calamari good but portion looks deceiving as lettuce lays below calamari."}
{"text":"Came here with friends on a night that there was an event in the arena. I knew it would be busy, what I did not anticipate was the open doors and lack of walls! It is hot here in the summer and wow I was melting the entire time. I spent my entire time in this restaurant using the menu as a fan. Do not come here before an event or you will sweat off all of your makeup! Happy hour specials are great here, but when it is really busy service is not that great and it takes a long time to get your check and pay."}
{"text":"I had a really, really bad service experience at Bar Louie. We were ignored for 35 minutes in total while our waiter flirted with a table full of women. We had their dollar burgers and while they're worth a dollar, I didn't think they were particularly good.  They made a mistake on my order to top things off. I'm never, ever going back.

{"text":"I am sad to say I ran into this bar while looking for a seafood place and after driving by this place a few times I pulled up. The only reason I got out the car is that I saw a few ladies on their patio having cocktails from a distance and the outside looked nice. Ok I warn you this review from this point is about to go off the rails.   I walked into bar that didn't match the outside at all!!! The place was not packed so when by myself I like to sit at the bar to save room for couples or larger groups. It took the bartender a while to greet me and by that time I knew what cocktail I wanted. I ordered the Colorado Smash since it had Bourbon in it. The drink showed up with moldy mint and YES, I have pictures to prove it. When I mentioned it to the bartender, he said all of the mint was like that and it was freshly opened and I told him I know ad i saw him open the mint but that they must've bought a bad batch. Then he tells me that he will gladly make me something else as he is picky too which made me want to say then why did make me a cocktail with moldy mint. But instead, I asked him to make me the same cocktail with different mint. He did and it looked better. Then he tells me it's purple mint. But I know better purple mint in its transition does not look like that. Which of course made me look at him again and beckon back to watching him making the cocktail while looking at a menu and mentally questioning his experience as a bartender. But he was so nice and accomdating that I couldn't be unkind.   I then asked him to recommend something to eat which he did. The salmon sliders. They came out way after other people who came after me food and he was lukewarm, greasy and not tasty. I ended up taking it apart and eating what I could considering it was the only thing I had since early afternoon.   Needless to say I sadly DID NOT enjoy my Bar Louie experience. One bright side is the bartender read my mood and gave me a voucher for a free flatbread but I won't be back. I am going to pass the blessing of flat bread to someone else."}
{"text":"An absolute must if you're going to a movie and want a drink ($3 drafts and $5 special martinis) and some half-off apps on a weekday from 5 to 7. However, we were bothered that none of the special martinis actually resembled a real martini. No gin or vermouth was used, it's mostly purees and champagne floats with flavored vodkas.  Anyway, the small plates made for good \"upscale\" bar food. Half-price apps make for a cheap, but nice, dinner and a movie - great, great specials. However, I would not buy a full-priced dinner here. Nothing aside from the apps grabbed me for the outstanding price. The baked goat cheese was small but delicious, and the tempura fried shrimp was just right but the sauces didn't match up exactly.  Be warned that the seats make you feel like you're going to be swallowed by them. Seriously, the booth was like sitting in the mouth of a whale."}
{"text":"First time trying- not disappointed. I had the house bloody mary, which was excellent. Next up, I tried the spiked bourbon burger- very delicious. To finish the night, we all shared the chocolate cake- the cake was good, but a little dry to be honest. Either way, a great night out to enjoy a 5 dollar burger and fries. The only thing that would make it better, would be an adult milkshake to go with the burger and fries."}
{"text":"I love the food and drinks at Bar Louie but almost every time I have visited the service I have received was less than satisfactory. Last time I went it took 45 mins to get wings and fries. We were sitting at the bar. It was very packed because there was a concert going on that night but the bartender never checked on us to see if we needed another drink or to say your food is coming out soon. She basically ignored us the entire time. I honestly think she forgot about us.   I will visit again because I love the food, drinks and location but I really wish I could get good service!!!!"}
{"text":"It was just OK. Not sure if the staff was still just inexperienced. The place was very warm inside."}
{"text":"What can be said about this Bar Louie that hasn't already been said.  Very generic with really slow service.  Drinks are a bit overpriced for the area.  Odd crowd but mostly young professionals from the area.  If you're looking for a bar in the area, keep on driving past Bar Louie."}
{"text":"Beaded, tiara'd, and ready to start some trouble--our gaggle of bridesmaids showed for a Bachelorette party seeking an outdoor table on a beautiful evening. The terrace was full, so we asked if we could occupy the vacant private room right near the hostess stand.  \"That's for VIPS,\" said the hostess. \"We ARE VIPs.\" said our fearless leader.  A stare-down ensued. The fearless leader asked for the manager. He was very chill about the whole thing, he said the VIP room was ours as long as we spent $15/each. No problem there.  We ordered several rounds of $5 (pint-glass sized!) margaritas as well as some provocatively named shots for the bride. She's partial to Blow Job's--recipe for a happy marriage.  They really did treat us like VIPs--offering up a round of Red Headed Sluts on the house, and sending in the DJ for special requests. \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\" and \"Single Ladies\" please!"}
{"text":"Super yummy margarita until I see the lime is inside my drink. It didn't really make me think about how gross bar fruit until it was an ugly brown like mixed into my drink. Nice waitress though"}
{"text":"Visit Date 02/23/2017  Bar Louie has fall off BIG TIME!! I used to like this place.   I normally get the same thing EVERYTIME I came there...... well EPIC FAILED MY LAST VISIT!! The Effen Good  MARTINI is....well WAS my FAV there. After my last visit I felt that I had to tell them how to make it. She left out the agave nectar, can you image drinking something that taste like lime juice? NOT GOOD. The waitress take the drink back and they added the agave nectar. But it still was too sour I just could not drink it anymore. So I paid for a sour drink that I did not drink. NEXT was my food, again I ALWAYS get  the Tempura-Shrimp. My last visit it was more like Extra Brown Over Cooked Tempura-Shrimp. I ended up pealing off the bread and just ate the shrimp. I did order a side of fries, they were the best thing had that I ate that night from Bar Louie.   My husband enjoyed his Buffalo-Totchos but I did say he wished it was a little more tots.    The sad part was the waitress know about my drink and do you think she even ask me how everything was? or if my drink was better?"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first time; but not the last!!!  Tara was our INCREDIBLE bartender for the afternoon!  Great variety of drink selection along with a full menu.  Don't miss out on an unforgettable experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Bad service here I give 0 stars if i could and these are my points why it was bad there no acknowledgement of me at the bar   Took awhile to get served people next to me got two order in after my order was taken.  Serve me 35ml of a Shot which not the standard of a shot.  Quite rude to certain kind of customers that come in by the way the spend and dress which is quite being bigot of my life style"}
{"text":"Poorly timed and often lacking in service, they management has really gone downhill. Had to ASK for refills after 25+ min of waiting to be offered. Don't know what's going on in their kitchen, but on $5 burger nights, you'd except them to have their act together. Again, it all comes back to management. It's not the same, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was not bad.  Service was HORRIBLE!!  We were sitting at a table and a waitress came for drink and appetizer order.  Took 15 minutes to get 1 alcoholic drink, but 3 waters and iced tea didn't come.  We asked several people, several times for them.  It took an additional 10 minutes. Then we had to ask to find our waitress to order.  She never checked on us after the food came."}
{"text":"I've tried various things on the menu. Non of them good. Very bad food but good environment. Come for the drinks and that's only if you're ok with spending a few extra $$ for a $10 bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Conveniently located near Harkins at Tempe Marketplace for a drink or quick bite. The drinks are creative and delicious but a little pricey. I enjoy their food but nothing special- typical upscale bar food. I wouldn't recommend to a friend other than over happy hour. Oh, and stay away from any type of bleu cheese on the flat bread- just over takes all the other ingredients!"}
{"text":"Good drink (new old fashioned)Food was so so (shrimp tempura app), but service was NOT good and I think it may have been amateur night in the kitchen. Food took a long time to arrive for a simple fried appetizer - approx. 20 mins. with zero acknowledgment from my bartender.  Shrimp were cooked well, but sauces were extremely salty & sweet to be paired with tempura batter.  The bar is drafty and customers other than me were complaining with no noticeable change. I'm not staying for a main course"}
{"text":"We frequented a Bar Louie that was near our house years ago in Colorado, but it's been a while since I visited one.  We stopped by Legacy Village for a late lunch one day last weekend, and decided to check out this location.  We were promptly seated at the bar, and service was very friendly.  They have a good variety of beers on draft, including a lot of local options, although they're a bit overpriced-- the large is only a dollar more so order that to get your money's worth.  My husband had the special wings with the Bulleit bourbon sauce, and said they were delicious (they smelled amazing).  I had the crab cake sliders, and they were all right.  It was an odd surprise that they were deep fried, but the flavor was really good, the tater tots were great, and the portion size was huge.  This isn't my favorite spot in Legacy, but sometimes bar food is what you're looking for, so I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"love this place- always sit at bar with friends and their quesadilla is delicious as well a their mojitos. Favorite bar in Tempe marketplace!"}
{"text":"Bar Louie is my go to place in the Waterfront.  Consistently good food and friendly talkative wait and bar staff. Lots of wonderful specials but nothing tops Tuesday, dollar burger night, a Bar Louie tradition.   Especially nice in the summertime when the garage doors come up, windows open and upper loft patio is full.  Flame pits are on the patio and provide warmth on a cool night. The food is an eclectic mix.  Burgers are great as are the tots, get them loaded or better yet down them for speed :). Mussels are good, salads are great!  Appetizers are all excellent.  Try the Bavarian pretzels with quest or the calamari!  My favorite, especially on a cold or rainy day is their chicken tortilla soup.  If you give a green light to the cook, he'll spice it up to en fuego,  the way it's meant to be eaten.  Endless refills of soft drinks allow you to sit and chat for as long as you like.  This is a wonderful spot to people watch on movie night or catch some of the Steelers who like to stop by. Love places that keep eating out fun.  This is a place where they remember your name!  Recommend strongly!!"}
{"text":"Had to kill a few hours before my flight home, dropped into Bar Louie to kill some time and enjoyed a few beers. Food was good, I had the wings. The beers were delish. Best part was the staff. They were all fun, personable, and down to earth. When you go, ask for Blake- great guy behind bar. Knows his beers and keeps the drinks coming - he'll take good care of you."}
{"text":"While staying next door at the Sheraton snd popped in for a quick bute.  It was a Tuesday at 5pm.  We sat outside and waited some time for a waitress.  Once she arrived, she told us about their dollar burger special on Tuesday.  She indicated there was a seperate menu for that and stated she would bring it.  10 minutes later she arrived with the menu.  Basically, a basic burger is $1.00 and you pay for each topping.  Fair enough.  Ordered a burger with cheddar, bacon, grilled onions, avacado, and lettuce.  The burger arrived and looked pretty basic and small in size.  It contained a single patty, one sluce of cheese, a single slice of bacon, a single slice of avacado, a bit of onion and lettuce.  Each addition to the burger was from $.50 to $1.00.  Took a bite and the burger was dry and cooked well.  The waitress never asked how I would like the burger cooked.  I finished it unimpressed but I gyess what should I expect for a $5.00 burger.  With a single mixed drink my bill was less than $12.  Worth $12 but not enjoyable at all."}
{"text":"Stopped for drinks after dinner. The martinis are tremendous. The bartender was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. The decor of the bar is really cool. They have a cool deck. They have great music and a ton of televisions for watching the game."}
{"text":"I hate to give a bad review, but our experience at this Bar Louie location was abnormally disappointing.   First off, we had a party of 8 people. We realized that seating our group may be a challenge. We offered to split into several tables to make things easier. We sat at 3 tables in the patio area. The entire place was not very crowded for a Saturday night at 10 p.m. We expected great service and planned on ordering a few rounds of drinks for our celebration.   We waited about 15 minutes before a waitress acknowledged our table. We told her we were only ordering cocktails and no food. She took our orders while looking fairly disgusted. We waited patiently enjoying the outdoor seating. 30 minutes passed. 45 minutes passed. An hour passed. Finally, I went to the bar to see if there was a problem or if they lost our order. Our waitress had not come back to our table during our wait. The bartender said they were almost ready. The waitress arrived with our drinks a few minutes later and rolled her eyes on multiple occasions as she placed the drinks in front of us. The waitress knocked into a woman's chair and failed to apologize and proceeded back inside the restaurant.   Our waitress was simply rude and had a bad attitude. She made a few other errors with drink orders and mistakes with our bills. We were patient and polite, but she didn't seem to care. We would have loved to stay for another drink, but we didn't have another hour to wait around for bad service.   All in all, we all felt that our experience was quite poor especially because we've been to other locations and had good times. I would hope that our experience was a rare one since the cocktails are delicious!"}
{"text":"I was here yesterday with 10 of my friends during the Christmas bar crawl, we all wanted to order drinks and food, our waiter Jermey got very mad at me because when I asked for water he told me no because there wasn't any glasses, so I told him to use the ones on the table, it took over an hour to get food and drinks, he was very unfriendly and rude. I understand they were very under staff ( poor choice by management) but that's not a excuse to be down right unfriendly. Customer service needs to get better from the servers to the bartenders. Very disappointed as I love Bar Louie!"}
{"text":"I am not from Arizona, and i have recently been coming around here for $5 burger night. Excellent price by the way especially during happy hour! I also enjoy coming in to see the ladies at the bar. Corita and Niya are my favorite they're funny and not to mention pretty. That's all I need to visit."}
{"text":"Love coming here.  4 out of 5 stars because the service is always suspect.  the food is not, however.  Great food done in an Elevated American Cuisine style.  I love making this my go to place when I am around."}
{"text":"5 of my friends and I came here last night for happy hour and a few drinks before a movie. Their happy hour specials are great! Try the bruschetta, calamari and chicken quesadilla, all were delicious! I had a lemon drop martini for $5.25 and also really liked it. They have plenty of beer on tap and some pretty fun cocktails. The service was quick and very pleasant. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I frequent this bar when visiting Pittsburgh. It's location along the Monongahela River gives it a view of the water and the city.  If you're sitting outside the only nuisance you'll experience at times because the tracks also run along the river.  We stopped here two times this week and had varying service levels, once attentive and the second we had limited visits from the server and she did not have our drink orders when stopping back after periods away.  They claim to have the \"best happy hour\" in Pittsburgh and I'd agree. Happy hour includes half price appetizers, $3 for all draft beers, $4 for all wines, and $5 for all mixers. Also, be careful when ordering your appetizers, they have huge portions.  While here we sampled the meatballs, boneless buffalo chicken, buffalo calamari, sliders, and spinach and artichoke dip. All were good \"bar\" appetizers. I recommend the spinach and artichoke dip the most.  For mixers we sampled the \"Effen\" good martini (yes it reads this way on the menu). The martini includes Effen cucumber vodka and mint (maybe a few other items), but we were huge fans and had this martini each visit.  In addition, they have an excellent beer selection both on tap and in bottles.  They have many seating options including couches, bar seating, tables, and outdoor."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was ok. Need more food variety on the menu. And more lower tables on the outside patio."}
{"text":"If you are reading this review, it's because you are thinking of coming for burger night on Tuesday. Just don't. You will end up ordering your delicious sounding appetizer and burger, waiting 55 minutes, then finally wising up and canceling your order. To which the server will apologize and note that you are the fifth cancelation in the past hour.   This is not a busy restaurant, in fact it is completely dead six days a week. Which explains why they can't handle 5 dollar burger night. I am sitting at the bar as I write this and after canceling my order I hear the bartender warning others trying to order that there is at least a 45 minute wait on food.   PASS"}
{"text":"I love Bar Louie's food but no matter whatever location I go to I receive bad service. Literally every location. I feel like now it's just part of the experience I guess. It's also a chain so I feel like the food should be the same at each location and I have had a couple different times where I received something different in a regular order. The servers are nice just not proficient. Good food though and not too expensive."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant! I've been here a few times and it's always been a good experience. Also I just wanted to give a shoutout to the server Miranda! She's been my server the last two times I've been there and she did an amazing job."}
{"text":"$18 tuna plate served cold and veg complete mush. Sad so far. Beer is good. Bar is sticky. Sent the food back, see what I get. How disappointing to try to choose a decent place to eat and get served garbage. Second attempt was hot but the rice is still cold. Add water to your steam table."}
{"text":"It's good for what it is, which is a bar franchise. Not really like you're neighborhood bar.  It's a little more upscale the drinks are delicious and as long as you're ok with paying around $8 for a cocktail then this place is for you. The food is typical bar food slightly dressed up. The fries are wonderfully good."}
{"text":"A friend and I visited Bar Louie on a Tuesday evening because I'd heard the \"dollar burger\" deal was worthwhile. The burger deal was pretty decent, and it's the reason I'm giving this place two stars instead of one.  Let's start with the location. This is a bar in the middle of Legacy Village, the suburban monstrosity sometimes comically referred to as a 'lifestyle center'. I walked in the door at 6pm. The place just felt so completely suburban, corporate and generic.   All the seats at the main bar were taken. I grabbed a seat at the secondary bar. My friend arrived five minutes later. The stools were about six inches too short and had no backs for me to hang my coat. My friend and I felt like children sitting at the 'adult table' for the first time.  Our bartender was dressed about half-naked, with a short jean skirt and two-sizes too small tanktop. This in spite of the fact that it was the dead of winter, with 30 degree air and a half foot of snow piled up right outside the door. Don't be fooled. Skimpy outfits and stellar service do not go hand-in-hand.  Nevertheless, the beers on tap are very run-of-the-mill. I asked what Great Lakes brews they had; the bartender said Dortmunder and Conway's Irish Ale. I ordered a Conway's. She brought me an Eliot Ness, which was actually what they had on tap. But not huge deal, I like Eliot Ness just fine. She then proceeded to botch my friend's drink order as well.  There were TVs all over the bar, all tuned to the same station (ESPN). Some of the TVs were connected with HD, others were not; so half the TVs were five seconds delayed - a huge pet peeve of mine in bars with TVs.  One great thing about Cleveland and Cleveland Heights is that there are so many great and unique bars. Amazingly, despite the complete lack of unique character, this still managed to be one of the more pretentious bars I've been to around Cleveland. I'm sorry, but corporate chain bars are just are not my style."}
{"text":"The $1.00 burger comes out to about $9 after you add lettuce, onions, pickles and jalape√±os plus a $5 basket of fries. Happy hour mojito a are great and should be for $10 a pop. Nice view. Great ambiance. Should have ordered the over priced not cold enough beer."}
{"text":"Well, we stopped in after a Guns and Roses concert. It was a busy show that has been advertised for months and is within walking distance. There is a big sign that says they serve food the entire time they are open...not true.  We sat outside for 20 min. before tracking down a server. I had overheard that they were closing the restaurant early and I wanted to get a food order in. She was kind enough to take our order. 15 min later we received the srinks we ordered. 40 min after we ordered our food, we hear the cook come out and yell at the waitresses saying that what we ordered was it available....it took 40 min to tell them that?!?! So, we changed our order. The hamburger sliders were terrible and the fried onion rings were so soggy. The nachos were just ok. Now, this is not the waitresses fault!! She was great. But none of the tables were being bussed, food was not being ran and even when a glass was broken she still received no help on a full patio. Very poor management decisions!!  It started with understaffing and ended with a manager who obviously chose not to manage.  The 2 stars is becaus of the waitresses hard work and the potential the bar/restaurant may have on a not so busy night."}
{"text":"Instead of heading downtown for food, drinks, and the Cavs game, a group of us decided to hang out at Bar Louie in Lyndhurst. This set up was so much better than having to drive downtown and then worry about parking and the wait time for a table. The Stone Fruit Sangria was cool and refreshing! Perfect for summertime weather! For my meal, I ordered the Southwest Burger with a turkey patty and a side of tots. I enjoyed the chill atmosphere and was also able to support our Cleveland Cavs!"}
{"text":"Did not enjoy any aspect of this restaurant. Had the shrimp po boy. Bland and boring. My husband had another sandwich, the Vesuvius. Also not good. Service was slow although the server was nice. Oh, and no one greeted or seated us. Not a big deal, but when we decided to seat ourselves, no one showed up for at least 5 minutes.  Okay drink specials was the only real up side. Zero value in the food though."}
{"text":"The food was edible, however I was extremely disappointed with my experience there.  First off, no one working wanted to be there- you could see it on their face and through their lackluster service.  It is a \"seat yourself\" environment that creates an atmosphere which no server knows how many tables they actually have.  Once we did meet our server, I don't know who she is because she never introduced herself, we realized the fan in the door way made it far too cold to sit on the patio.  We asked the server if it could be turned off and disappeared for about fifteen minutes only to tell us that the manager was too busy- I would have at least offered to move our table.  Then we finally got a chance to order- we waited a very long time to get our food and even when it came out it wasn't hot.  My friend and I ordered the same burger, however hers was supposed to be well done while mine should have been medium rare.  The server did not know whose burger belonged to who and asked us to cut into it to find out.  One was medium, the other medium well- the server shrugged and just sad \"well switch them\"  I wouldn't go back, it wasn't worth my money- I could have gotten a better burger at smash burger next door."}
{"text":"I am a frequent visitor of Bar Louie on West 6th. Despite a few instances of slow service, this place consistently serves up tasty dishes and cocktails.  Bar Louie is a great spot for just about any occasion. I have gone here for birthdays, before concerts/sporting events, happy hour... The large open layout is comfortable and a breath of fresh air from many of the too-cramped restaurants downtown.  My favorite deal at Bar Louie is $1 Burger Tuesdays. Beef, Veggie, or Turkey Burgers start at $1 with toppings for around 50 cents a pop.  I really enjoy their turkey burgers and love pairing them with different cheeses and toppings.   If you are downtown and looking for a restaurant that is reliable and can handle a large party, try out bar Louie."}
{"text":"I rarely ever eat downtown but I'm trying to expand my horizons this summer so me and a friend headed to Bar Louie this afternoon. Pretty cool place architecturally-speaking, I dislike restaurants where you're sitting on top of other patrons, not a problem here. I do have to mention that today it was 80-something degrees and humid, when we walked in, the a/c felt great so we decided to opt for indoor seating. After 10 minutes of cooling off from the hot car and brief walk from W. 9th, we started realizing that it was unreasonably cold. Let me say for the record that I NEVER get cold in the summer. I'm a sweaty Irish bastard and after 20 minutes inside, I was wishing we sat on the patio.   Our server was polite but not at all what I would call friendly. Drinks arrived quickly and she asked if we would like appetizers after we had maybe 40 seconds to peruse the large and widely varied menu. My friend got a chicken flatbread and I ordered the BLTT, which adds turkey to a standard BLT. I asked for the spicy mayo instead of the regular. Our food took a LONG time to arrive and there were no more than 6 other tables of 2-3 people and tickets were staggering in, not rushing the kitchen at all. Our server apologized for the food taking so long without us even asking about it. When the food finally did arrive, I was ok with the wait. My sandwich was two meals (and I'm a big guy) and was VERY tasty with pretty good french fries. The chicken flatbread was also very delicious and an appropriate serving size for 1 person with a little help from her large friend. ;)  Both items were hovering right around the $10 mark, not bad for a place downtown. The beverages are not cheap, $2.50 for a Diet Coke and $3.50 for a strawberry lemonade with no refills. With tax it brought our bill to about 28 bucks. Not hateful, but those drinks seemed a little over-priced (especially since I know the margins on soft-drinks).   We waited again a little too long for our check to arrive and our server wasn't close enough that we could ask for it.  By the time it arrived to the table, we were scrambling to get out of the frigid restaurant and back out into the heat. I've never left a place in the middle of summer actually shivering but it happened today.  I swear that place must have been around 60 degrees.   All in all, a worthwhile trip. The prices on their happy hour, like Maria mentioned, are ridiculously cheap, definitely going to stop in for that sometime on a Tuesday and try that $1 burger. Of the few places I've eaten downtown, I think Bar Louie is probably the best tasting food I've had so far. They definitely need to step up the service and the kitchen needs a fire lit under its ass. I've spent years working in the industry and our meals only needed about 10 minutes to cook, not 35."}
{"text":"Settled on this place after touring around the city because we happened upon it when we were hungry and thirsty. All the other places in this center looked a little too commercial or noisy.  Bar Louie is a nice place. The music was a little loud inside but we sat out on the patio which offers a brilliant view of downtown. The food was actually pretty good for what is mostly a bar/club.   I would have given this place one more star except that the service was a bit slow. Not bad, just annoyingly slow. Also, the bathroom has an attendant. This is just one of those things that really irks me in places like this. Because some guy has blocked the paper towels I have to tip him when he hands them to me. And no, I don't want to be prayed with cologne. Lame.  If you can get a patio seat and avoid tipping somebody on restroom trips, this place is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Sat at the empty bar for 25 minutes on a Tuesday before being asked if I want something. Got a beer, asked for the wifi code, didn't work. Another 25 minutes and finally got in a mediocre app.   Literally every city I've gone too the service has been awful. I've finally learned my lesson."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends for a going away party. I will say I was not impressed with the service at all. The drinks were ordered before we ordered for food and we almost got the good before the drinks.  We continued our night here and the service continued to get worse and worse as we ordered more good and drinks. I will definitely not be back here again."}
{"text":"This has become our usually Wednesday night hang out. Wednesday night here is known as dollar beer night, where Bud Light and Miller Lites are just $1, or you can splurge on Coronas for $2!  My friends and I usually get seated along the sofas near the fireplace. This is perhaps the best spot to have some drinks and to catch up with each other. The atmosphere is pretty chill in this area with the gas burning fireplace and comfy seating. It's also quieter since its further away from the bar. Definitely a great place to hang out on a Wednesday night on the cheap (but please tip at least $1 per drink)"}
{"text":"My bosses took me here for lunch on my last day. The outdoor seating was very lovely. The food was pretty good as well, though not super memorable or anything. The service was extremely slow. Another perk is that they give a discount to people who work in Station Square, which is nice. Between three people, our total bill came to just under $30. At least it wasn't one of the giant chains that make up most of the dining options in Station Square."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to frequent this location all the time. Unfortunately the service has gone downhill. Depending on the day and staff you can get good service but most of the time we leave irritated at the service or lack thereof. Even the food has gotten iffy. The bulleit boneless wings taste like deep fried cardboard with sauce splashed on top. It takes them 2 or more tries to get a burger with a substitution of spinach made right. It's a shame because this place is reasonably priced and convenient."}
{"text":"I'm really not even sure why I am giving this place any stars at all.. while i haven't ever had a bad experience at any other Bar Louies, my experience in Station Square on Saturday evening was horrendous...I met some friends out for some appetizers and drinks around 8:15pm before heading out -- BL wasn't even crowded... the air conditioning on one side of the restaurant didnt work, so we moved to accommodate our party and sit in cooler conditions... the waitress made several of my friends carry their own food over to our new table, even though the food hadn't been served yet.  Other people's food never even made its way out of the kitchen (although they all ordered food at the same time)... the food that did arrive was cold.. and there were only about 20 chips served with the dip trio... much more dip than chips...  once we moved in the restaurant, we sat for 30 minutes without even being tended to, I had to approach the hostess table 2-3 times to get anyone to come over - when we finally got our server, she took our drink orders, went to sort out the food problem and then came back... without drinks.   I sat for about 45 minutes without even being given a water... keep in mind this was a muggy, 93 degree evening... we wound up asking for the food that was delivered to be comped and we walked out of the place, quite frustrated & hungry at 10pm."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner and atmosphere during the Cavs playoff game.  The hummus and veggie appetizer was fantastic and the blackened fish tacos were very flavorful and fresh.  A fun place to have a casual dinner with prompt and professional service."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for an early Tuesday evening. SCORE! It's 5 buck burger night! Upon entering this location there is a sign saying seat yourself. No one greeted us and through some weird on goings a server moved people who were sitting at our reserved table. No big. The room is open and loud. The decor is young and hip. Bar is in the center of the room with many tvs over the bar. Booths, high top tables and regular tables. Misters for the patio but it's June and it's way too hot to sit out there. The place was busy and we were a large party. I ordered the Fried Louie. Since we were a large party, our order got split into two tickets which came out at two different times. Not convenient but it worked. My burger came and it took me forever to ask for a side of mayo. By the time I got my mayo, I cut my burger, well done. BLECK. As soon as I returned my food to the runner our waitress, Angelina, came back to reconfirm my order. She was just as patient she could be with us. Being a large party with all her other tables, she was rockin it. My burger finally arrived once everyone else was done eating. WOW! What a great combo of egg yoke to burger!  Wished the lettuce was a leaf and not shredded tho...  Seems like a great spot to hang with friends and have a few drinks!"}
{"text":"Came in Sunday 6/22. Sat at bar. Took bartender seven minutes to even say a word to us. 7 MINUTES!!  We order immediately afterwards. 20 minutes into being seated, there are 10 persons in the whole place and 4 visible front of house people.  1 bartender,  30 seats, 9 TV screens on, Indians Tigers game. 23 minutes later our food came. Was good but now were really pressed for time. May or may not be back."}
{"text":"Deduct one star for offering sixteen \"martinis\" but not knowing what a Gibson is (neither the server or bartender knew) and not have cocktail onions!  I bartended for years and cannot grasp how any business that has a bar could have a bartender that doesn't know what a Gibson is? The Marini was just so so. Could not taste any vermouth and the olives were blah.  My suggestion to the owners: spend the six dollars per jar and get some better cocktail olives and stock some cocktail onions. I'm cannot be the only one that drinks Gibson's.  The Voodoo Chicken and Jerk Chicken lettuce wraps were very good! I have to admit that I had very low expectations about the food after my drink fiasco but I was pleasantly surprised.  Overall, the food was good. Our server was good but not very friendly. Minimal personality to say the least."}
{"text":"They really need to improve their service. It takes them so long to even get drinks to your table when the restaurant is not even close to being full. Ordering your food is like pulling teeth. Expect to be here more than an hour and a half only because it will take so long to order and get your food. Takes like a half an hour to just get drinks"}
{"text":"The food was great the service was below bar. We grabbed a seat at the empty bar to catch a noon World Cup game. The game was subbed which didn't do much for our viewing experience.  Since we were the only people there we thought we would get quick service, but it took 30 min for our food to arrive. To their credit the food was well prepared and fresh. I would come back for the eats if I could bare the experience."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad, but not great either.  Can't really complain there.  Service was horrible.  It wasn't even that busy but food took a long time to come out and when it did two of the four dishes were wrong and a third came out  10 minutes after the rest.  Maybe that's more or a kitchen issue but still.  When you need refills it's frustrating to see the server smoking out front."}
{"text":"Wow haven't been to a place that messed up this bad EVER! First off we were asked which size beer we wanted 16 oz and we were given the 20 oz. Next up my husband ordered a \"Louie Burger with tots\" there are 3 different Louie burgers on the menu. Can anyone else see a potential problem here? Well guess what they didn't get us the wrong Louie Burger they gave us a portobello burger and it is called a Portobello Burger on the menu.  Needless to say he also was given fries.  We clarified we needed a fried burger with egg and tots. Drumroll ... This time we get a different Louie Burger with onions and still no egg or bacon.  To top this off I had ordered the chicken tacos (which were awesome), however the rice and black beans were totally cold. We refused to pay for any of the burgers and I told them about the rice and beans but they only took off the burger. Our total out the door was $40 bucks and we aren't planning to return.  Which is really a shame as I have been 3 previous times and loved it.  The last time being the day before I got married with family and friends.  Talk about ruining a great thing and memory."}
{"text":"An okay place to grab some drinks or a bite to eat.  There is a great view of Downtown when you are sitting outside however there are trains that pass by a lot and they are really loud.  You have to stop your conversation until they pass.  The food is typical bar food and the drink selection is no bad."}
{"text":"Look there are about a gazillion higher end bars to go to that have good burgers, but this place is just consistently good. My wife and I go there before going to the movies. Not your typical chain."}
{"text":"Ok - I'm trying to cut this place some slack since it was the night of fireworks at Westgate and it was packed (at first). The seating is open which would normally be a great thing to me but on a busy night maybe they should've had a host(ess).  My group and I found an open seat eventually that hadn't gotten cleaned yet. No problem! Except the dirty plates on the table must've made the staff think we had finished eating because no one came for literally twenty minutes. Finally, someone in my party flagged a waitress down who wasn't even supposed to be ours. Even after we ordered it took a HALF HOUR to get chips, salsa, and guac. Seriously? A little long..   I'm giving three stars because when our server was around, she was extremely friendly. She apologized numerous times for how everything was going and it really wasn't her fault as she wasn't even our assigned server. However, waiting in 20-30 minute intervals for food/drinks was extremely obnoxious. Towards the end of our stay, it wasn't even packed in the restaurant.   The drinks, however, are amazing! Whoever is tending the bar, while they are slow, they are great at what they do. Grab a couple mixed drinks from the bar while you're here!   All in all - they need to just work on service and staff accordingly for busy nights. I wouldn't come here on the weekend."}
{"text":"Stopped in when Dave and Busters was so busy it wasn't worth the attempt.  The hubs and I ordered 2 perfect drinks and the appetizer was spot on.  We were able to watch the football game and listen to live music.  The singer was fantastic..sounded like miranda lambert!"}
{"text":"Horrible service just horrible. The salad was overdated and nobody even came to apologize, the girl just took it away!!! A couple left infront of us cause after 10minutes of waiting no one acknowledged them!!!"}
{"text":"As I'm sitting here currently with my friends. I called to make a reservation and they said only for parties of 10 or more. So, since we don't have 10 that didn't work.   We got here and my friends were seated. JEN approached us and said \"you can't sit here I just got a phone call for a party of 6\". So we had to up and move. As we sat down, she said they accept parties of 8 or more, and not same day reservations. Wait a minute... Didn't you just say 8 and that you just got a call for the reservation??? I said the table you moved us to is the same size as the one we are sitting at, she said \"they requested that specific table\". Are you kidding me? Unreal! She told us she was the \"reservations specialist\". Our server came up, we asked for the manager and he said JEN is the manager. What is this place?!!? A freaking JOKE! I am sitting here wasting my time writing this review over a lady named \"Jen\" who shouldn't be in the service industry. Jen - next time do us all a favor, don't lie to your patrons!"}
{"text":"A really great place to meet friends before seeing a movie at Harkins.  The menu includes a nice variety of appetizers at reasonable prices.  The cocktails are good and don't break the bank.  Depending on the evening, they occasionally have a life band."}
{"text":"I travel lots for business and this is one of the funniest places.  Heather provided great service and NCAA B-BALL on the screens"}
{"text":"Didn't even know this spot existed at Southpark, until a friend suggested we check out a special for $2 martinis and free apps. WHAT? Ok! I really wasn't expecting much, but the selection of special martinis was good with decent vodka (Skyy, New Amsterdam, etc), and the apps were full sized! I have only been to one other location, on W 6th in downtown Cleveland.  Our server was EXCELLENT, so I couldn't figure out why the reviews were so bad for this place...until I found out that our server and another one around us were in from Columbus to help out for this special. These ladies were fun and friendly, exactly what a server should be. (We have all worked as servers...perhaps we have high standards?) So, I asked around to some people sitting around us. They said their service was bad on previous visits (slow, inattentive, no personality). My friend echoed that comment, stating that each time she had been here, it was dead, but the service was not on par. If they can meet the caliber of servers they brought in from Columbus, I would most definitely return, because we had so much fun!  Other than that, keep in mind that this is in Southpark, so be prepared that parking may be a big challenge on weekends and near the holidays. I was here on a weeknight, so maybe this is already in place, but valet service on weekends would be helpful. I'd pay to avoid parking hell. :)"}
{"text":"Possibly worst bar service in Pittsburgh with mediocre food. Avoid it if you can and head to a different north shore location."}
{"text":"I stopped in with my family because it was close to the theater. It was only after we sat that I took a glance at the yelp reviews. I don't mind telling you... They scared me , a lot. But I decided to give them a chance.   Service was actually pretty good. We got seated right away and a waitress quickly took or orders. The drinks came out promptly as did the food. I ordered fish and chips to be on the safe side (i mean, who can f-k that one up, Amiright?). The food was fair. It won't win awards but why would you expect it to? It is a sports bar not a place with chefs from La Cordon Bleu.  As an aside, I had my boys check out the bathrooms, since that was a specific complaint. They happily reported a clean toilet bowl.   All in all a positive experience!"}
{"text":"I've had very varying experiences at Bar Louie in Cleveland and in DC, so here goes.  I had the first GREAT LAKES CHRISTMAS ALE of the year here, and it was perfecto.  Rich, smooth, went down the throat like...butter.  Buttah?  Anyways, it was great.  Our waiter was great, kept our waters filled, and didn't linger.  I ordered the BBQ salad - you know, the one with corn, tomato, tortilla strips, etc.  It was already $9, and chicken was an extra $4.  Seriously?  So I went veg.  But it was disappointing. The lettuce mix was strange and felt very bagged, there was no cheese, no black beans, no real kick.  I guess I was looking for something that didn't exist.  Such is life.  My mom and bro seemed satisfied with their burgers, tho.  I'd come back.  Just skip the salad."}
{"text":"Came here for a refreshing drink after strolling Comicon over at Gila River Arena. Ordered a Festivus Sangria, which I was happy to find out does NOT have citrus in it, since citrus allergies permit me from having regular Sangrias, Mimosas, or anything else made with oranges, lemons, limes, or grapefruits.   The Festivus Sangria was a Christmas holiday drink that Bar Louie has carried over & I'm happy they did. It was SO tasty! My friend & I each had one. The drink features Old Apple Orchard, Argutura (sp?) Bitters, Cinnamon, cherries, etc. I can't remember all the ingredients but do remember how delicious it was & I'd totally order it again!   Another friend met us there & we all enjoyed a drink, the ambience, the atmosphere of the place, & how relaxing it was. Our bartender was awesome & checked on us a lot.  The ONLY drawback was the customer a couple stools over ordered something so strong & full of citrus, as I mentioned before that I'm allergic to, & loaded with strawberries, which my friend is allergic to. The bartender made the drink then & there & that was our cur it was time to head out, being us ladies were having allergic reactions.  I will go back next time in the area (perhaps after a Coyotes game)."}
{"text":"This Bar Louie is probably the worst Bar Louie location I have been to. Despite the menu and the aesthetics of the restaurant, it is critical to remember that this restaurant is a BAR.   Part of me thinks my expectations are too high. This is basically a TGIFridays with a new name. All of the food pretty much tastes like it was frozen with a lot of salt and butter. May sound good to some but it just makes me feel like I take a bite and immediately bloat.   I think this restaurant is decent for appetizers... And that's it. I tried their pasta but asked for double shrimp instead of sausage. Was very spicy which I like, but was just super processed tasting..."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this bar!  They seemed to have an interesting menu, but honestly, my food wasn't that great.  I had the brisket sliders- which I was told were phenomenal.  I am the type of restaurant patron that ALWAYS asks the waiter/waitress what the restaurant is known for/house specialty/most popular things on the menu... It just helps me narrow down my selection if I don't have a taste for something in particular.  The food was just \"okay.\" The bathroom was a mess -- literally. The drinks were really good. Waiter was pretty cool.  All in all, I would probably go back to watch a basketball/football game, have a drink, and order appetizers.  But I wouldn't go to this restaurant for dinner again.   I hope this is helpful!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of coworkers for lunch a few months ago and the experience wasn't that great. They liked their $12 salads just fine, but we soon found that not much else was as advertised. The truffle butter popcorn, microwaved. The drinks, overpriced but good. But the tots, pretty darn good!  We're heading back tonight for $1 beers, here's hoping things go better the second time around."}
{"text":"We came in for some mimosas and brunch and our server ignored us for 20 mins but the beautiful Xcari came to our rescue and took care of us. She was amazing and we are super lucky that she helped us. We will definately be back for the food but more importantly to see Xcari."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with the food and quality of service at Bar Louie.  This restaurant has now been in Tempe Marketplace for some time, but I never had that urge of a feeling to go try it out.  At least not until recently when my boyfriend and I had about an hour to kill before the start of a movie.     We were instantly greeted with a warm welcome walking through the door and seated promptly.  Our waitress, Brie, was very nice and seemed to enjoy being there.  I got a little cold sitting inside and she was more than happy to help us move to the outside patio.  She gave us the suggestion of ordering the LOADED FRIES and they quickly became the best part of my meal. These fries came in a giant dish and were smothered in queso, bacon, scallions, and some scattered sliced jalapenos. I could have eaten the entire thing of fries for my meal and loved every minute of it!! However, I did order other items, which were also tasty, but I was still wanting to stuff myself with fires.  Being polite to the other dishes on the table, I tried my fish and chips, which had a nice light batter. Also, tried the buffalo wings, which had tons of flavor, but weren't overly spicy.    Again friendly atmosphere and great food.  Try the loaded fries for sure! lol I dont know how obvious I can be on the enjoyment of these fries :)"}
{"text":"Sign stated \"Seat Yourself\" so we should have know the service would be horrible from the moment we walked in.  We originally sat upstairs, which was open per the sign.  After 20 minutes we got up and went outside. After 20 minutes outside and after the waitress taking care of and making small talk with the table next to us, we said screw it and walked.  The one other time that I had been there the service was so-so.  I will never go back.  Why should I have to try to track people down to pay for a meal?!?"}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday night.  Not their best night.  It was slow and the drinks were dull.  And everything seems to be sticky: the floor, the glasses, and the bar counter.  I'm sure on other nights that it's a happening spot, just dead on Sundays."}
{"text":"Stopped here before the Pirate game. Not busy and the patio had some empty seats. Sat down and waited on promptly. All down hill from there. Beer was warm. Service was horrible at best. 1 hr for the food to come. Once it arrived it wasn't good. Wilted lettuce, dried chicken and no taste. On top of that order was wrong and one of our party never received his food. Then the bill was wrong and needed fixed. Very disappointing start to a beautiful summer evening."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday night about 6:40pm not busy, no door greater, sat at the bar, bartender wasn't behind bar, took 5 min before I was seen and acknowledged from bartender who appeared to be a server gabbing and joking with customers..... worst Bar Louie experience I've had.  I don't believe I'd ever visit this location again, and I stay within walking distance when I come to town once or twice a month for work....who pays for my meals when I travel."}
{"text":"easily one of the worst experiences I've ever had. my boyfriend and I came here (just left) for the first time and we were never acknowledged by either of the two bartenders and (it was SO slow, too) we had to verbally state \"hey can we grab a bucket from you?\" before we were served. while in college, I was a server/bartender so I tip 100% at all times and would have ordered a bunch of food and drinks but the service was so slow and awful that I didn't want to spend another dime here.. nor will I ever. 2 thumbs down  oh by the way, from the time we ordered a bucket til the time we left it was 72 minutes (we waited for someone to acknowledge us to give them the benefit of the doubt so we can order food and nothing) and left our money at the bottom of the ice bucket--- like their customer service."}
{"text":"The food was really fresh for 9PM, and the drinks were spot on! Our server Danny was AMAZING!!! We talked Football and didn't get into an argument! LOL;) he remembered our order and brought out exactly what we had requested. He kept checking in on us, so we really knew we were being taken care of."}
{"text":"Great happy hour for Martinis and Apps !!! Heather was our server and despite it being so busy she rocked it ! Would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"This place is great!! The bartenders make you feel like family, especially Alexis, Jason, Kate and Bill! This is my favorite place to go in the North Shore!"}
{"text":"Severely unimpressive.  Gave it 3 chances and we will not be back.  Food is average, at best.  Servers are like ho-hum...you want anything? Some servers sitting at the bar, charging their cell phones and texting.  My wife got a wedge salad with shrimp and there was maybe a dozen baby shrimp....looked like they came straight out of a can.  I had pulled pork sandwich. No sauce....just dry pulled pork.  Restaurant was not busy at all....maybe 8 tables with customers and bathrooms are atrocious. Go to Burgatory or Hyde Park but don't come here.....bad."}
{"text":"Walked in no one to great you , server walked past said seat yourself. Found a table sat and waited 10-15 min greeted by a bartender who was very apologizing. Whole time watched what I think was a manager ( not dressed professionally)  He walked around never made eye contact , acting like didn't want be there We ordered apps which were great."}
{"text":"As someone who spent several of my younger years working in the food services, I NEVER write bad reviews because I know how hard it can be, but in this case it was just so bad I couldn't keep my mouth shut.    My family and I stopped in on a Saturday for \"quick\" lunch, As soon as we walked in the door I should have known something was off. I immediately noticed the staff seemed like they all had better things to do and seemed annoyed that they had to work on such a beautiful day.  It took about 10 minutes after sitting to get any sort of acknowledgement we were there... Strike 1.  After we got our order in, it took over 40 min to get or food!  so much for a quick lunch!  The place was half empty and it seemed like the tables around us were annoyed at the slowness of the kitchen too... Strike 2.  When our food finally DID arrive, it truly wasn't anything to rave about.  All of it was bland, and the chicken was dry.  The worst part was the fact that it isn't a cheap meal.  I could have got a much better meal for far less elsewhere... Strike 3!  In addition to all for this, I heard numerous complaints and i was paying the bill from other tables getting the wrong orders!  For an established restaurant, these problems are completely uncalled for.  This was my first and last time at Bar Louie."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting Bar Louie. Went with another couple. Saturday night from 5:30-7. Seated yourself. Plenty of tables available. Place was about 1/4 full. Very friendly and efficient waitress. Music was being heard from a band outside on the \"green\". Soccer was on several nice sized TV screens. We ordered a total of five mixed drinks and three appetizers. Drinks were very good. They definitely don't skimp  on the alcohol in them. The \"Ultimate Bloody Louie\" was awesome. We also had the Crispy Calamari, Bavarian Pretzel Sticks and the Loaded Tots. Only complaint about the food, was that the Crispy Calamari only contained six small pieces. Not enough. The bill including tip was $121.00. We did have a good time and will visit again."}
{"text":"While the food was good, the service was AWFUL.  The restaurant was well-staffed and not overly busy, so we could not figure out why our waitress was so slow.  We politely voiced our disappointment with the manager, and she was very apologetic, going to far as to buy us a round of drinks, although we told her that was not necessary.  One would think that after lodging a complaint that the service would have improved, but no such luck.  Based on our experience, it would seem that the owners went well out of their way to hire the most inefficient, apathetic, unpleasant people they could find.  While this place has potential, without a major personnel change, I predict that they will be hurting for business before long.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I stopped in to Bar Louie for a few hours before the Pirates home opener. It was pretty cold out for a Pirates game, so there wasn't as many people hanging outside as there will be in the near future. The inside looked beautiful. Art work was great, the tables were very intimate. The staff seemed to have their stuff together. All the bartenders seemed to be in a good mood. The outside was very inviting with a little fire pit and some low chairs and tables surrounding it. I noticed 2 garage doors that will open when the weather is nicer for easier in and out access to their outside. This is by far the nicest outside area of any place on the North Shore. Their tater tots are always great, so you can't go wrong with those. loaded or not. They have what seemed to have about 45 beers on draft, a large range of wines, craft cocktails, and awesome looking Martinis. I noticed some pretty good happy hour specials as well. This is probably going to be my new go-to spot on the north shore for the summer. 2 Thumbs up for me. I had a great time."}
{"text":"Rip off! Only drink here for happy hour! No drink Prices in the menu-so, have some fun and ask them the price of each of their 50 drink offerings.   How do they get away with this!?????  Food okay, but wait until HH for half price appetizers.   Good luck!"}
{"text":"If heading to the Westside, this is a stop I would recommend. We went on a Tuesday night and they have this Tuesday offering where you can choose from several burgers for just $5 bucks. This is accompanied by some pretty good drink specials too.  We sat on the spacious patio that wraps around the west side of the restaurant. It is a great seat and incorporates you into the vibe of Westgate.   The menu has a ton of offerings and fits about everyone's taste. The cocktails are well derived and this is a fun place to host a party or office happening. Located near the Coyotes home makes it a great stop before the game. Don't forget the Cardinals are just up the street as well. For the non-sports fan, Cabela's is just across the street to the north and the outlet malls are located to the west.  I like Bar Louie because it is very casual, kid friendly and located in an area that lends to fun and excitement with hustle and people watching. Trust me, you will see some serious characters here! So, if hanging on this side of Central, come and check out the diggs!  #barlouie #westgate #irishcatv2 #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"Simple bar and grill with a simple menu. I recommend the salmon sliders and the tater tots."}
{"text":"I'm always excited when new bars open up at Tempe Marketplace, and I headed to Bar Louie this past Wednesday. Lucky us -- Wednesday's at Bar Louie means $1 domestic drafts, which is quite the great deal.  We sat on the patio, which had some skewed views of the televisions at the indoor bar. What was probably supposed to be the \"hip\" and college-friendly inside of Bar Louie seemed like a more brightly colored Cheesecake Factory. There was nothing striking about it that made it seem like a dining destination based on ambiance alone.  The food wasn't much better. My companion's fish po' boy ($10) seemed to be served on the same \"burger basket\" you would find at Chili's, and I was really disappointed with my own meal, which was nothing above the average sports bar in taste. We started with chips and salsa, nacho cheese and guacamole ($7), but there was nothing exciting about it. The chips didn't taste homemade, and the salsa was bland. It was a disappointing start.  Next, I had a cheese quesadilla ($7), which was just as meh. The tortilla wasn't evenly distributed with the cheese, and it was too crispy.  Besides the mediocre food, the service at Bar Louie was pretty bad. It was awhile before our own table was bussed, and the one right by us (where we actually wanted to sit to get a better view of the game inside) was left unbussed for probably 20 minutes after we sat down at ours. Bar Louie might be seeming like it's trying to class it up at Tempe Marketplace, but I wouldn't want to go back unless it was for one of those $1 beers."}
{"text":"Came here to meet my husband for lunch. Not busy and we were seated at 11:40am. Lunch order of a salad and burger taken at 11:45am. It is currently 12:20 and we still have no food. Was told there was only one chef that showed up. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Decent place, good decor, service was regular, location was good. I would come again, but on a more common night like fri or sat"}
{"text":"Bar Louie has your typical \"bar style food.\" I went here for $1 burgers last Tuesday and was impressed. With the purchase of 1 drink (they have $3 drafts, $4 glasses of wine and $5 martinis on Tuesdays), you get a burger with lettuce for $1. Additional toppings are 50cents, but include things such as cheese, sauces and vegetables. I had cheddar cheese and jalapenos which were extremely spicy, but added good flavor to the burger.   I also heard that they have $1 beers on Wednesday nights so I'm pretty sure i'll be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere but have been here a few times and consistently had bad service and crappy food.  It's too bad because they were not even busy on a Friday night and we waited over an hour for food.  So bummed this place can't step it up!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. You just walk in and seat youself. We were greeted fast and drinks were brought fast. Food was delicious as well. Ask for Melissa, she does an amazing job."}
{"text":"Was visiting Pittsburgh, walking around Station Sq, menu looked good,  restaurant looked welcoming.  Chose seats outside, ordered our drinks and nachos, then when we were ready to give our order we were told they were out of a lot of things.  The waitress told us they didn't have cheese, any pasta or fish tacos so we chose something other than that but we knew it was possibly a sign of what's to come. Had a few bites of the nachos and were not pleased then the food came rather quick and we dug in, about three bites in we were done because the food was not appetizing at all. We both got upset stomachs from the canned products there were obviously used for our dishes. We spoke to the manager and got it taken off the bill. The ONE positive thing about this place was the waitress we had. She was extremely helpful, quick and extremely pleasant. Too bad the food was so horrible,  this place has a great location for a restaurant."}
{"text":"We come here many Friday nights because they are not crowded. However I have realized the reason they may not be crowded is the horrible service and the fact that they have an event menu instead of a regular menu when there isn't a hockey game or concert going on. We sat at the bar and literally waited 30 minutes to get a food order in. All the bartenders would look at us and then not help. Looking around the restaurant most of the tables are empty and the staff has congregated around the bar not paying attention to their customers. The female bartender only seems to want to help out the male customers, we were here on November 17, in case the management truly cares about the image of this establishment."}
{"text":"Came here last halloween & it was beat! There was maybe 30 people in the entire place and they were all old and not one was dressed. The bartenders werent the cutest ones ive ever seen, no smoking, food is usually ok at BAR LOUIES... ENDED leaving here later and went to buckheads."}
{"text":"The food at Bar Louie is surprisingly VERY good. the atmosphere is amazing and all the staff is amazing. My server, Miranda, was especially exceptional  Would come here again 10/10"}
{"text":"alright, i'll give this poor, beleaguered rating a little love. i was actually favorably impressed. came on a wednesday so $1.25 for domestic bottles which is bananas, even in cleveland. younger, male dominated scene but a nice fleet of intriguing female servers and bartenders to cut the testosterone. food menu looked good and fairly priced which is very cheap for crocker park. bartender was very prompt and attentive. i will be back soon."}
{"text":"I am only giving it one star because zero isn't an option. We went to Bar Louie for a birthday drink or two. Well, we sat at the bar. And waited. And we waited some more. They weren't short staffed and the bar wasn't busy. No, those two kids behind the bar were far too busy playing with their phones, to pay attention. We were never acknowledged, nothing. We waited 10 minutes. And then we voted with our feet. Won't ever go back there again. I'm too old to deal with kids who don't care about working. We ended up going to CPK and got great service from a waiter who WANTS to work."}
{"text":"This bar Louie is really good for parties and gatherings! My friend had her 25th birthday in the party room in their basement. It was really nice! The servers were really nice and provided efficient service! The bathrooms were also very clean! I ordered a strawberry lemonade sangria; it was bangin!!!"}
{"text":"Saturday night at 7pm walked right in and sat down, wonder why?  Servers too busy, drinks and food slow to come out. Restaurant next door had a 1 hour waiting list, wonder why?  TIP, do not order the Voodoo Chicken poor presentation of a frozen chicken breast."}
{"text":"GREAT happy hour! We got drinks, spinach artichoke dip, and buffalo chicken flatbread. All was very great!"}
{"text":"We come for $5 burger day.. but order drinks and appetizers. Food is pretty good no complaints on the we love sitting on the patio now that it's cooler out but the service SUCKS BIG TIME. The past few times it takes forever to get a waiter then this last waiter just basically ignored us we had to on several occasions get a different waiter to help us. He kept forgetting to bring us refills or it took 15 minutes to get ketchup Smh ?"}
{"text":"Kim is such an amazing waitress. Fun happy, singing and super cute! Thank you Kim your awesome."}
{"text":"Going there before Pirates game is rad but for normal night it's just OK. There just isn't anything with their food that is memorable"}
{"text":"Yiikkkkesss!   We boated about 5 hours to Pittsburgh with the sole purpose of having too many drinks with people we haven't seen in a while. Translation: We were ready to blow more money than we should.   First problem: Place was empty and Steelers were playing. Should have taken this as a sign, but figured we would be focused on. Asked for a non-Steelers game to be put on since we had several out-of-towners and waitress they don't get that channel. Now, I could understand lying to me (or just be honest and say \"no\") if the place was full - people are Steelers fan - but it was empty! Eventually the truth came out and the channel was changed without begging. Oh, look, they magically have that channel.  Second problem: You don't get to eat and drink when I am not. First martini took a little under a half hour to get to me. Again, it is EMPTY in this place. Someone points out that the waitress is eating pizza and drinking at a counter near the kitchen opening. Table next to me asks \"what is wrong with this girl?\" and we all consider leaving. Finally get my martini and cold apps - ew, once warmed spinach dip is now hard. But yay for yummy pretzel dips?  I order another martini and wonder why I bothered. Honestly...the martini menu looked good and I had no desire to get drunk at Bubba Gump next door. How bad can it be? Second martini takes 22 minutes...again we see her eating and talking to coworkers.   Unfortunately, spending a ton of money on endless martinis didn't happen. 2 was enough waiting. Beer drinkers felt the same as their beer took as long, water refills were forgotten, and one beer order wasn't even remembered when we said something as she finally came back.  Never saw a manager. Asked for one. Just got a beer taken off bill. Ok, nice meeting you too.   I would never dock the boat here again or eat/drink here. Geez! What a mess!  Note to waitress: The faster you bring drinks, the more people who want to get drunk order, the better your tip is. Also, get a new job."}
{"text":"bar louie is in tempe marketplace.  i had a good experience here.  the food was pretty good, mild selection of beer, and service was prompt and friendly.  would love to come back whenever i visit phoenix again!"}
{"text":"So...don't go there for mimosas. It's all orange juice. Oh yea and don't go there for good service."}
{"text":"Have had two very good experiences here. One when the place was SLAMMED and another when they were slow. Both times I got the exact same superior service. The martinis are very nice and unique; I appreciate something other than the standard Cosmo, lemon drop, etc. Good specials and the seating is varied (tables, couches) and you're open to sit where you please.  The small plates are good for sharing and I'm pleased to say that they have more vegetarian options that is standard in the area. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were turned away at the bar 45 minutes before closing. They also said they were out of all food so we couldn't even get food to go or a drink! We will definitely not be back!"}
{"text":"Great place...Great food!  Good Managemanet and staff!!  Nice meeting you last night Rachel!!  See you again soon!!   Randy and Donna"}
{"text":"My experience here was just ok. Their special on Wednesday is really good-$5 martini and 1/2 price on select appetizers but I have to be honest-I'm not a huge fan of their food. It is way too salty most of the time and lacks flavor where it is needed most. And in order to indulge in the martinis you gotta have nibbles. Nevertheless my time with my friends was fun. Next time I will plan to eat first."}
{"text":"About 10 years ago, this place would get PACKED with young professionals here for happy hour.  And the happy hour specials are still pretty good ($4 wine!), but no one comes here anymore.  It's ok, but it's just ok.  The space inside is nice, and there is a nice outdoor fire pit and seating area.  The food is solidly mediocre.  It's not great.  The other day I had the pear salad, and added chicken to it for $4.  For a now $15 salad, they shouldn't have used frozen chicken (I can ALWAYS tell).  Prior to that I had a Barnyard Burger that was pretty good, but the outside of it was so charred you really couldn't taste much other than charr.    There's nothing really wrong with Bar Louie, its just very meh.  Its an alright lunch spot, and a great place to drink at--if you want to drink alone.  One plus though--the service has alwyas been excellent!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour 4-7 M-F specials half off appetizers and awesome drinks like a snake bite for$3.75 bc it's made from beer  on tap"}
{"text":"Everything about our dinner was amazing! Came here for a friends birthday and had an amazing waitress Alex (female) who was friendly, personable, and literally so attentive that she was right there whenever we needed her or our drinks were running low. Great service!!  Kudos to the chef too because we shared and everything was so delish, especially the Mac and cheese! Would give 6 stars if I could!!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill.  I ordered a Spicey Pineapple Margarita and the server immediately told me it was not good and don't order it.  I then ordered a Me and Julio Margarita which came out in a martini glass.  It was awful as well so I sent it back.  Finally ordered a glass of wine and maybe 1/3 of the glass was filled for a $12 glass.  Can't speak to the food as it's taken 20 minutes for 2 easy apps.  The upkeep is also bad.  I am sticking the floor as there was a spill and was not cleaned up properly.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"Been here twice each time the service has been right on. The first time we sat inside the second out on patio. Servers knowledgeable and friendly. Atmosphere cool food Excellent. The flatbread pizza was to die for, house margaritas delicious and artichoke dip yummy."}
{"text":"Service couldn't be worse. I shouldn't say that... they probably could be worse!! Server came by once every 20 mins in between drink orders and food... waited an hour to actually get the food which was sub par."}
{"text":"Service was very weak and they were dead last night. Food was good, but act like you want to be there helping out and serving people. Second time there, lucky they have good wings. We choose you guys over Yardhouse."}
{"text":"My review is based off my last visit which was when I only stopped in to slam a beer before a movie No joke I was about to watch 2 Guns and there was no way I watching that sober  The bar is a nice little bar with a good selection on tap. I was on a mission since the movie started 20 mins after I sat at the bar with my friend  I'm pretty certain the nice bartender girl was thinking I was going to order a Cosmo or some girly drink but I threw her off by ordering a Blue Moon  The next part I hope no one saw... I finished my beer in less than 5 minutes  I kept giggling but I was on a mission  So I finished it and it turned out to be only $4 which was great  Then off to 2 Guns, which was cheesy and a little boring  But Mark Wahlberg was in it.  Next time I'll try the food... And I won't rush through my drink... ;)"}
{"text":"I like the setup at Bar Louie--they really opened up the space formerly occupied by Blake's Seafood.  There are a mix of types of tables available--small high top tables for two, regular sit down tables for four, and bigger high top tables for groups of eight to ten--in addition to two bars.  A number of flat screen TVs hang over the bar areas.  They offer 20 beers on tap, and while I'm far from a beer expert, all the selections seemed pretty basic.  The wine list featured 9 whites and 7 reds, all also available by the glass which is a plus.  The menu has fairly wide range, albeit lunch and bar food focused: 17 small plate offerings (i.e., appetizers or bar food), 4 flatbreads, 10 burgers, 7 salads, 13 sandwiches, and 8 entree items.  But enough with the background and on to the actual food:  I've been to Bar Louie a handful of times now, and I have yet to come across anything particularly impressive.    The Chicken Avocado Club was unexciting: maybe around Panera Bread-level which is kind of disappointing for an actual restaurant.  The Fried Louie Burger--a burger with bacon, cheddar, and a fried egg--is probably just barely good enough to get by.  You can get a much better burger across the street at B Spot as well as a marginally better one at Champps.  As for bar food, don't get too excited over the Truffle Butter Popcorn--served as an overflowing bowl of popcorn on a plate.  There is just enough of a whiff of truffle butter on that popcorn to avoid a lawsuit.  The \"signature app\" Bavarian Pretzel Sticks would be decent if they weren't so incredibly salty.  Do yourself a favor and knock at least some of the salt off the stick before digging into the cinnamon butter, queso, and honey mustard dippers.  The Chicken Nachos might have been the best thing I have had there (note the relativity)--toppings in a relatively clean layout (not a messy goo) though with slightly stale chips.  Despite these criticisms, Bar Louie gets a pass because of the nice layout and general environment (a much more difficult thing to improve upon than the food).  Plus, while I haven't stayed much past midnight, I understand the kitchen is open until 2am, which is impressive.  Finally, Bar Louie fills the \"casual bar\" void that Champps seemed too small to fill and had been missing for so long in the Crocker Park Wonderland."}
{"text":"It was nice. I liked my food. The waitstaff were a little inattentive for an near empty place on a Saturday, but nonetheless, i would come back again."}
{"text":"This place tries hard to not be like a regular bar, but a cool bar (Mean Girls reference, anyone?). When you walk in, you can walk right into the area/seating of your own choosing. There's no hostess at the door so don't waste your time waiting at the front to be acknowledged.  Since this is a bar, there are plenty of drink specials available throughout the week. I'd suggest that they also start offering entree/app specials because their food is mediocre at best and not worth full price.  Besides the food, Bar Louie suffers from incredibly S-L-O-W service. The two times that I've been here, the place hasn't been packed but with the service I've experienced, you would've thought they were dealing with CIAA-level crowds. On both occasions, I've had waitresses who seemed to forget to that they had food to bring to tables. On my last visit, my table waited at least 20-30 minutes for food to arrive. All that was ordered was a salad, sliders, and chips with salsa & guac.  Bar Louie is good for a drink (or two) and to catch up with friends but don't expect to do both over your food."}
{"text":"This review is aided by the happy hour martinis. I'd give those 5 stars- but they lose stars for average food and inside uncleanliness. For $5 (and change) the martinis are very good! I don't like the taste of alcohol and these are very flavorful- mask it well. Smores (pictured) and Honeydew are my favorites. Drafts are $3. Makes for a nice date night happy hour before a movie. Not sure I'd come here when it's full price, though.   The food here is pretty average- good selection but flavor is nothing spectacular. For the purposes of happy hour, though, it's good. Husband had pork tacos and I had buffalo chicken flatbread.   Service was fine. Seat yourself. Last time I was here we sat outside because the inside floor was really sticky. Server came over quickly and got us waters right away, refilled without needing asked. If I had to sit inside, though, I probably would've left. Seriously, the floor was nasty. At 5:30pm? Inexcusable. Sorry. I've been here on a Tuesday for cheap burger day and don't remember it being so sticky, so maybe it was just a bad day.   Bottom line, sit outside for happy hour. Or pass."}
{"text":"Excellent list of local beers on tap! I had blackened fish tacos and hubby had a crispy chicken sandwich. Mike, the best server, did a wonderful job navigating the menu!"}
{"text":"Ryan our server was excellent, as always I have good food and service for happy hour..."}
{"text":"Maybe if we were drinkers this would have been a better experience, although the menu looked appealing, the food was mediocre at best and the service was horrifically slow. Overlooked fish In the tacos, just blah. Perfect setting and patio, am sure drinks would be fine, but skip the food!"}
{"text":"I was just popping in for lunch with my mother in brother when we came into contact with the slowest service ever. Forty five minutes have went by and we still have not received our food which was 2 salads and a burger"}
{"text":"Lets just say I have had much better chicken and fish tacos. Guinness was good, and the shrimp skewer was good. Not good enough to want to go back. Service was great, but there were very few people there when we were."}
{"text":"Poor service, dirty tables, seat yourself but no sign telling patrons to do so Chop Chop salad came out different than ordered, totally forgot Buffalo Chicken flatbread but they did comp it and my son said it was good, Tortilla soup was ok but definitely have had better, wings we're so so Had to wait 20 minutes for 3 draft beers Restaurant was crowded but no wait so don't understand why there was such poor service"}
{"text":"The Tuesday night special, burger and fries for $5, combined with their regular happy hour is awesome. Fed the whole family for less than $30."}
{"text":"First time I've been to a Bar Louie. On this occasion, I was here with a large group of colleagues (and co-Yelpers) for an after-work happy hour. I was impressed! The atmosphere was great - high ceilings, mid-level lighting, high tables and chairs, sports on TVs ... and $1 domestic bottles of beer. I think everyone pretty much ordered off the \"small plate\" menu and it all looked pretty good. I went with the bacon/cheeseburger sliders and they were very good. Based on this outing, I'd say - yes - I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!  Wine festival at university and your waitress is your bartender and your cook!?!?   I've watched at least 300.00 walk out the door. 4 families got up and left"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks!  Staff is super friendly and service fast and efficient! Looking forward to coming back often!  Best Bartender Award goes to Niya!"}
{"text":"We walked in around 12:30 on a Saturday. And it was not that busy however we proceeded to be ignored for 15 minutes. Finally the waitress walks by and says that she'll be with us shortly. She never interacted with us again. The bartender comes over and asks if we've been helped 15 minutes after that. We were just about to leave so she managed to salvage our visit.  However she wasn't the friendliest when she came to help us.  I finally got ahold of some drinks 10 minutes later. Finally an hour after sitting in the place we get our food and it was mediocre.  It's such a shame because so many people told me to come to Bar Louie.  I've been a mystery shopper for over 5 years. And it's a damn good thing they're not one of my clients. I don't usually take time out to write bad reviews but I feel like these people hardly left me a choice considering the amount of idle time on my hands."}
{"text":"Save yourself a trip...do not go here.  They water down their drinks, and the waiter was terrible.  The food was average...go to FireWater instead. It's around the corner, better food and drinks...ask Rob the bartender for his opinion on the food and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. First time we sat in a booth in the back away from the bar and there were fruit flies all over the place. One fruit fly even decided to take a bath in my friends drink. Service was very slow. My wife ordered a wedge salad with no onions and the server brought it with onions.  She order one of the featured cocktaisl and had to send it back  because of the overwhelming amount of sour mix used by the bartender.  Our friends drink was mixed very poorly as well but he just mixed it  with his sweat tea to cut the taste. The second time the service was even slower.  My wife ordered the wedge with no onions again, and again the waitress brought out one with onions.  The service is just too slow and there is nothing special about the food or cocktails. I would rather go to the TGI Fridays or Applebee's  across the street than come her again just to be disappointed."}
{"text":"I wish I could give less than one star. Last time I was here, I vowed to never return again. Horrible service and mediocre food. But met my sisters here after shopping and thought I would give it another try. $1 burger night Tuesday and seat yourself. There was a handful of people in the restaurant so we chose a high top by the bar. Sat there for about ten minutes, no one acknowledged us. Finally a \"server\" came over and he never made eye contact and asked our drink order. He was doodling on his menu pad. Great start. Drinks came quick, ordered a coke and took a sip- it was flat. We were ready to order right away but server bolted after he dropped our flat drinks off.  Waited at table with menus closed for a solid twenty minutes and decided to leave. Finally got another servers attention and asked if she could find our lost server. He finally walked by and pretended not to see us.  He finally took our order but instead of doodling in his order pad, had his phone out. I'm guessing pretending to take our order on his Notes app. Mentioned the flat Coke and he said he will try to fix for us. After awhile came back with more flat Cokes. Knew he was useless so we went to the bar to see if they could get us non-flat pop. Bartender said no one could fix it. There were about 20 staff members there and an empty restaurant and no one could fix the Coke? Isn't that restaurant 101? So ordered water instead.  Our food came and luckily it was hot because if it was cold we were out of there. Server never came to check on us. Until the checks came. He came over four times to see if our check was ready. Where was he the whole night? Definitely won't be back. Hope Yelp doesn't put this is the non- useful reviews where they put bad reviews but this place is plain awful."}
{"text":"So I have walked past this joint many a time while at Tempe Marketplace, but I never gave it a second thought.  I don't know whether it was the logo or the perception of stuffy hipsters inside - but I'm glad I did.  They have a solid happy hour with specials on drinks and food, the service was attentive and the ambiance was much better than I expected.  Based on the other places I have had a beverage in the vicinity, this place is one of the better options for sure.  Totally worth checking out during happy hour, I have no idea about the standard menu - but if I'm thirsty and in the area I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place five stars because the food is amazing!!!! I love the Portobello Burger here!!! It's so tasty and the Portobello Burger is the best ever. This place is open later and it's nice and super clean. They have a great bar for drinks. Lots of choices to choose from. Come on Tuesdays because they have 5 dollars burgers every Tuesday!!! Best deal ever!! But the reason for the three stars is because of the service. The service was so bad. They weren't  all that busy but the waiter and waitresses are more interested in talking to eachother or being on the phone rather than helping us. After we got our entrees , we realized that there was no silverware, so we had to go over to the table next to us for some because our waiter was no where to be found. Every time we needed something we had to wait extra long for the waiter to come by to help us. I love the food but just wish the service here can be improved."}
{"text":"Keep walking. You can do better. The service was pretty lousy and the food nondescript. I suppose if you're looking for a place to get drunk, the food would help you sop up the extra alcohol so I guess it would be OK."}
{"text":"i love the bar areas here - several to choose from.  on the food front, the pretzel appetizer is the best.  have also tried their salads for lunch, which was good.    from a crowd perspective, it's hit and miss.  i've been here when there's only a couple of tables, and then when the bar is packed.  still trying to find the peak volume times."}
{"text":"Horror show.  Check out the men's room photo. Medium burger was a charcoal briquette. Tater Tots were good. Avoid this place like you would avoid the bubonic, Black, or any plague. Disgusting. Plenty of other excellent choices within walking distance."}
{"text":"Egg on the burger wasn't completely cooked. They kept changing TV channels, so you couldn't watch a game all the way through. So we left."}
{"text":"It's basically Yard House without the extensive tap selection. If you're checking out this review on-the-go, this sums it up and you can stop reading here.   /review   But if you have the time for some context, then much obliged! I remember the old Bar Louie well. It's where Calico Jack's in Westgate currently resides. At the time, I'd just turned 21 and thought martinis were the key to adulthood. I have to keep reminding myself that these, and not beers, are Bar Louie's specialty.   Which would work if there were more than a handful of them. And a few selections are eclectic and high quality, it's just that if you ever get the chance to see a real cocktail bar like Hanny's, you know having a few doesn't cut it.  It might be above-average for a chain, but the target audience still thinks slamming Absolut from fancy glasses makes them cool.  Anyways, I really want to rip on this place about beer. It's late Tuesday night, and no happy hour? That alone I could forgive, but $7 for LOCAL crafts...in 14 oz. glasses? Pints or GTFO. So now that you're losing to surrounding bars on selection AND value, let's talk about the atmosphere.   Pick better live music. The description on Yelp says the music is \"background\", but these horrific covers of songs of alternative we're supposed to love were near rock-concert loud in a mostly empty lobby. No one likes having to yell when it's not even poppin'.   If I go again, I'll try some grub and see if there's something from the spacious ambiance I've overlooked. But in value, selection, and atmosphere Bar Louie left me wanting a little bit more than it should."}
{"text":"Make sure you take your id with you if you decide to order an adult beverage because in spite of lcb law requiring photo Id if you appear to be 30 the barmaids here require it of everyone even if you are in your 50's... No wonder the place is empty. I guess I also need to add my only issue wasn't simply the fact of someone who is clearly over 50, with gray hair and wrinkles needed to provide id (which I did). And here's the link to the pa lcb poster for training purposes...  https://www.lcbapps.lcb.state.pa.us/webapp/education/item_images/4043.pdf  I also sat for a very long period of time without being acknowledged, the bar itself had not been cleaned, I asked for a bar towel to clean it myself, staff members were arguing with each other publicly (which was uncomfortable). This establishment is poorly managed."}
{"text":"First time at this new location.   I have been to the BL in TEMPE and sat at the bar and had a great experience.   No so good so far here.  Been sitting at our table for 20 minutes and no drinks yet.  Pretty bad service.  Ok.  They redeemed theirselves with great food.  It was worth the wait.   I will give them the benefit of the doubt and maybe they were working out the kinks.    Didn't have time to take pics of the food.  We inhaled it as soon as it hit the table."}
{"text":"I would say this place is average on food.  I do like the atmosphere.  Wouldn't be my first choice to stop at.  Calamari is good. My burger was fine- southwest. Blacken salmon wasn't blackened and it tasty fishy.  Never send anything back but did this.  I would say if you want to watch a game and drink a cocktail then this is the place. Eating with the family not so much."}
{"text":"Came here last night. Service was great and the food was just as good. They have a full bar but also have a wine selection as well. I had the buffalo chicken flatbread which was really good and different for me. This place is pretty new so it looks great inside and has a nice ambiance too. This is a place where you can come and hangout with the homies and watch a game or take someone out for a low key date for good food and conversation. There's plenty of different types of seat selections too.  They also had live jazz music last night, where local musician Harvey Cummings and his band did a great job mixing traditional jazz music with a little bit of RnB and neo soul.   Overall, had a great time and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Jill was such an amazing waitress - made our 4th of July so much fun. Come to Bar Louie and request her!!"}
{"text":"Very cool bar Louie, love the decor, the 2nd level, the beer was cold and the music was great. Besides that there are many better choices, no hostess so we sat at a high top by the bar, once a waitress final came over we got our drink order in and ordered boneless wings and loaded tots ( no green onions & not jalape√±os.) both well done.  Drinks came out quick and the food right after, fast service for sure except it must have been for someone else, the tots were loaded with onions ( although not green) & the wings had green onions all over them (you'd think if you say no green onions on one and the other comes with it you'd mention it , guess not. Neither item was hot and neither was well done, I mentioned it to the waitress, she did say sorry but made no attempt to fix the order.    Makes you wonder why at 8:30 on a Sat they were half empty....I guess now I know.  Seriously get it together.  I gave 2 stars instead of one because it's still seems like a cool place to grab a beer, but eat before hand for sure."}
{"text":"All I can say is salmon sliders and the berry mojito with double mint. Heaven on earth!! The chicken nachos are awesome and HUGE!!! Now one of my new fave spots in Nashville and a REALLY fun atmosphere! ! They would be the reason I go to the gulch and the valet parking is GREAT!!"}
{"text":"I am currently sitting at Bar Louie with my family. The service is horrible. We sat for 25 minutes waiting for our appetizer and the server did not check on us once. When my appetizer finally arrived, my husbands did not. He is still waiting 35 minutes later. We will never come back."}
{"text":"This definitely could be a very cool place if they just get the staff together and train them.  Basically what everyone else says...service is ridiculous slow, even on slow days.  You have to constantly ask for napkins, another drink, utensils, etc.   The good thing is the drink specials, excellent selection of draft beer, and the place all around with the outside/inside seating is neat.   Unfortunately, this just isn't a \"go to\" place after work for me...its a \"last resort and I've been everywhere else, so I'm looking for something different place.\""}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would.... watered down drinks, pricey, got upset stomach from the food..."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my lunch here the other day.  I had the turkey, ham and brie sandwich and it was delicious.  The service was friendly and I'll be back the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Came for date night and it was awesome! Our server was very nice and our drinks were always full!! The food and drinks are yummy forsure coming back!!"}
{"text":"Always have a good time. Stephen and Jordan (bartenders) always make sure I have one. Wednesdays are where it is at! Chase Morgan spins a mean set on the tables and the martinis are 1/2 off."}
{"text":"If you come here expect long wait times,for your drinks and orders. No one comes to check on you or offers refills. Only ordered drinks case wait was longer then 40 minutes.everyone seemed more worried about cleaning the customer service."}
{"text":"The  place is really nice, decor, the people, and the strawberry lemonade sangria is great. But the food is not that good. I have been to Bar Louie at the waterfront and the food wasn't good there either. I was hoping it would be different. There are a lot of places to choose from in Pittsburgh now so you're going to have to step your game up."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for interesting restaurants at Westgate but overall they've been pretty mediocre. Bar Louie might be better than the average there but that bar was set pretty low. We wandered in here one evening for a drink and a snack. It was good food, but a bit on the pricey side for what it was. They said they have a scratch kitchen and I don't doubt it, but a bit more creativity would have been nice. We had fish and chips, figuring that that's always a good way to test a new place. These were pretty good fish and chips but nothing that really set them apart from the usual. The service at the bar was attentive and cheerful and the selection of drinks was creative and interesting."}
{"text":"I'm a Bar Louie regular but I have never visited this particular restaurant. My friend and I sat at the bar and were greeted by the bartender who was the highlight of our trip here. The \" regulars\" at this establishment were rude and made the two of us ladies feel less than comfortable. Our bartender even told us that the men we rude. The food here was lackluster at best compared to the restaurant that I usually frequent. I'm currently writing this review while I'm sitting and waiting for what seems like forever for my check as these rude regulars continue to harass us. I honestly can't wait to leave. I wouldn't be opposed to giving this location a second chance but right this second sitting here waiting and being harassed I'm disgusted and can not wait to leave."}
{"text":"S'mores martini is delicious! We went for a light lunch and had chicken nachos and sliders. Very good and nice and quiet on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"My review can be summed up very easily  Tuesdays are $1 burger night Wednesdays are $1 beer day  Need I say more?  Lunches are pretty solid as well. Try the Blue Louie burger....blue cheese, spinach, bacon w buffalo sauce. Awesome"}
{"text":"Very much deserving of the \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" rating.  I went this past weekend for drinks with my girlfriends and the service what somewhat of a clusterfuck. We had two different servers because my friends were sitting indoors while they waited for an outdoor table to open up and after the moved I suppose their server didn't want to surrender their tip and transfer the ticket. This made for some awkwardness and unnecessary annoyance when my friends had to flag down, wait for (they took their time), and pay two different servers. As a former server and cocktail waitress, it all seemed counter productive.  My $5 Dortmunder was fine, but how can you mess that up?"}
{"text":"This Bar Louie restaurant at Legacy Village shopping center is clean and well organized. The kitchen and wait staff were alway friendly, cheerful, attentive and accurate with the taking of our food and drink orders. What I had for dinner was really very tasty that agreed with me very well. Would not mind going here again. :)"}
{"text":"Wesley is one handsome stud and his service can't be beat. When I'm down in North Shore, it's Bar Louie or nothing. Can't wait for Pirate's season - I'll be here early to get the best seat!"}
{"text":"So far so good, food was great and so was service it took a bit longer to get the food but everything was pretty great. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Only my third time to this Bar Louie and we have had a great time our bartender Corita was very attentive and so helpful when it came to picking a drink and a dish to indulge in. I highly recommend this place but only when she is here. Great service great food and a sweet atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had a really good experience at bar Louie ! Good atmosphere, good service, and pretty good food as well! They had live music playing and it was very enjoyable ! I plan on making many more trips to bar Louie !"}
{"text":"We went to Bar Louie for happy hour and had a great experience. The food is good but the service was even better. Our waitress Nicolle provided some of the best service we've had at any restaurant in quite some time. She was totally on top of her game -- greeting us as soon as we sat down, explaining the specials, taking our drink and food orders, bringing everything out quickly, checking back to see if we needed anything, stopping by and chatting for a bit. For happy hour beers on tap are $3, wine is $4, and appetizers are half off.  Here's what we got (all appetizers): - Potstickers: pork dumplings w/ szechwan sauce. Cooked perfectly and tasted great.  - Baked Goat Cheese: goat cheese surrounded with marinara. Comes with garlic toast. Nicolle brought out more bread when she saw we were out. It was a good dish but nothing spectacular.  - Cheese Quesadilla: large enough for sharing with a few people. Tasted good.  - Crab cake sliders: decent bits of crab, with lemon aioli, not too much filler. They were a little dry but tasty. I still haven't had great crab cakes in this city. The fried onions were pretty sad -- tiny stringy pieces of onions that were over fried.  Some of the wines were decent. Beer was good. Food is about 3 stars, service was 5 stars. So, I'm averaging it out to 4 for this place."}
{"text":"Walked in had to seat ourself which is no problem. Waiter walks over and said we will be right with you. We continued to sit there for 30mins with no drinks or menus. Watched the bartender ignoring customers with her face buried in her phone instead of helping her coworkers. During this time a table had to go to the bar to get their refills they were waiting on. Sad to say that we will never come back. They weren't that busy and appear to be extremely under staffed."}
{"text":"My daughter stopped in for lunch, looked nice from the outside and they had a nice patio. The weather was perfect for sitting outside. My only gripe is that it took a while for us to get noticed, once we did the service was good as well as the food. My daughter thought her Strawberry Margarita was too strong so she only had one. I had a few beers and we shared an order of sliders."}
{"text":"So disappointed in this place. Seems like no one is in charge. Or the one who's in charge doesn't care. I ordered the brisket sliders that's supposed to have a peach bourbon sauce and coleslaw on it. Could barely find either one and the brisket was dried out and hard. When I showed the waitress the slider she asked if I wanted some slaw or sauce. Yes, on the slider, when it came out. If I do it myself I may as well stay home and make my own sandwich and save some money. I asked for the sauce and it came out cold.  Figures. But what I don't understand is why the waitress was so non Chalant about the whole thing. Like she couldn't care less about crappy food coming out of the kitchen. Houlihans is right next door and I've never been unhappy there. See ya at houlihans!  Bye Louie!"}
{"text":"Sitting here now, it's been ONE HOUR since we ordered 2 appetizers. Granted there is a concert tonight this place has FAILED! To top it off its about 100 degrees in here.  Talked to the manager, Taylor, complete idiot. Non apologetic. The only bright spot was our server Jay. He did his best with what he had. DON'T RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"This was my go to place for happy hour because the specials are one of the best around!  I've been about once a month for the past year or so. This recent visit really made me think we need to change our happy hours to another place.   It's Labor day and there are 3 of us, young 30s young professional business women. I say this because when I worked as a server years ago I would \"judge\" my customers sometimes as though I knew they tip they'd give me. Okay so our server is a dude about our same age, didn't know his name until we got the check.   Time to get our drink order: about 3 stories deep. The 3 of us talk quite a bit, so that means it was about 13 minutes at the least. Time to get our drinks: after discussing my friend's entire experience with the Dave Ramsey seminars: so maybe another 15 minutes. The bartender delivered the drinks.   Usually the drinks are what bring us here: martinis 5.25 each during HH. These were not as strong as usual.   Food order: took it quickly, food arrived in normal time. Trio dip: small bowl of salsa, small bowl of cheese, tiny scoop of guac. This used to be small bowl of quac- I think they are cutting back on food. Flatbread: okay but dry tasting. Cheese quesadilla: nothing to complain about.   Round two for drinks: drinks were completely empty, including the waters before our server came back to \"check in\" on us. We asked for another round. This time was delivered by him within 5 min. Great!   Now, a crap ton of stories later, he comes back more than 30 min later (I used my text messages to estimate time) and drops off the check. So he didn't ask if we wanted more food, more drinks, nothing. We were all going to order some food to go for the hubbies who were at home...but decided we would rather leave since our server wanted us to.   We ask if he can split the check....and instead of splitting it as we ordered he just 1/3 the entire check. This is fine, but super lazy! Saw his name was Krys and decided Krys convinced us to have a new go-to happy our place. We usually tip 30%, Krys got much less. For the first time ever, we tipped based on service. Kona grill here we come!"}
{"text":"Marquel took care of my friend and I and she was great! I highly recommend this place great good and cocktails!! Thanks so much marquel"}
{"text":"I won't make the mistake of coming here again.  My husband and I had a little time to blow before a movie,  and I was starving.  Bar Louie is situated right next to the movie theater so we gave it a whirl.  We sat on the patio and were greeted pretty quickly and given menus. We ordered two different ipa's and looked over the menu as we waited for our beers. Once they were dropped off it took me seconds to realize this wasn't the beer I ordered and not even an ipa at that (pretty sure it was a dosxx).  When our server came back I told her about the mix up and she proceeded to smell it and tell me it was definitely the lagunitas ipa I ordered.  I told her I'm familiar with the beer I purchased and that it was definitely was not what I ordered, heck I told her to taste it. I didn't care about the mix up, but I did care about her standing there telling me I was wrong to my face.  I simply ordered another beer instead of being bitchy  about it. The food was very mediocre. I ordered a Flatbread board and it was edible but not delicious. The server was nice enough but I didn't appreciate the condescending way she dealt with things.   Do yourself a favor and just go to the thirsty lion.  It's not amazing but the beer selection is way better, and you get what you actually order."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience I've ever had. I have never had as bad of food as I've had here. Food was over cooked, burnt, and inedible. My husband and friends husbands who literally would eat anything didn't even eat their meals! How do you mess up pancakes? And how do you mess up nachos?!! My salad also had rotten, old lettuce. Bathroom you could tell hadn't been cleaned the night before and was just disgusting. Employees were no joke wearing their pjs. I saw another family walk out before even being waited on and I wish we would have as well. 7/10 of us didn't eat our meals and when we left we went to yardhouse because we were still hungry! Clean up your act bar Louie or let another restaurant come in to take your place! I would have rather eat at mcdonalds than the slop you served yesterday!"}
{"text":"Never been to this chain restaurant after dark but I've gone twice for lunch and find it very good. The warehouse district neighborhood and venue make it seem less like a chain than the one in Crocker Park, Westlake. Both times the sandwiches and side dishes were very good. I would go back and I guess that's the ultimate compliment in Rick E's world."}
{"text":"Literally the only place to stop in waterfront. Best happy hour!! Martini and drafts half off? Our server Kayla was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Ugh, we ordered mojitos, all 4 had brown bits of  rotten mint, limes looked like they were cut a week ago.  Showed them to our server, she pulled out a couple of the mint leaves and said, oh well....."}
{"text":"Came here before the CONCACAF Gold Cup game. With the Luke Bryan concert in town, we were obviously expecting it to be busy. However, we came at 4:45, were seated at a table and ordered our drafts, which took 10 minutes to receive. When the waitress came back we ordered a burger and chicken quesadilla right away. Now, I've worked as a waitress and understand how orders come into the kitchen, but by no means even if you're \"busy\" (aka everyone was ordering appetizers and drinking), should a medium burger and quesadilla take AN HOUR AND A HALF TO MAKE! Sorry, unacceptable. Personally, I think the waitress forgot to put our order in. It was honestly ridiculous.  Second of all, there was a waitress walking around with a low cut-completely see through shirt, boobs hanging out, clearly not wearing a bra. Listen, I'm in my mid 20s, it's whatever; I felt more embarrassed for the establishment and the tables she had to serve at 4 in the afternoon with children sitting at them. This isn't Tilted Kilt, nor was it past a certain time where that is acceptable. It was honestly disgusting."}
{"text":"Ordered a beer, got carded, I asked the Manager why since I'm clearly older than 21.  Manager told me it's the law that they see my id.  When I suggested that it's not what the law says he kicked me out.  Great customer service.    Fortunately it's TMP and there's more than one cantina."}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere.   However, they screw you quite severely on portion size."}
{"text":"What a gem in a great area I just wanted a really quick drink before we got on the duck tours and that is exactly what I got I tried the pineapple sangria and it was delicious if I would have had more time I would have got a picture the bartender was pretty prompt about making our drinks although the restaurant was not packed I do see how it can get packed. The bar had a tv with some football on. It was a great spot for a quick drink and the service was pretty good:)"}
{"text":"Our server had an aloof attitude and made us feel like he was doing us a favor for serving us. My margarita was terribly sour and I had to send it back (something I RARELY do). After eating the mediocre pretzel appetizer, we asked for our check without bothering to order dinner. Even the check took about fifteen minutes to get.  Looking on the bright side, I'm eager to see what restaurant will move in there when this awful place goes out of business in six months."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour specials on drinks and food and a really welcoming staff! Morgan was our waitress and was absolutely fantastic. Would definitely recommend the Effen Good cocktail."}
{"text":"Jessica C. was my server and she was AWESOME!!! Last night, I went to Bar Louie with two other co-workers for an after work drink. We had martinis all night (drink specials) and they tasted heavenly SHOUT OUT TO THE BARTENDER!!! Based on the excellent late night service, this may become our regular after work spot."}
{"text":"Before I came to bar Louie my night was not going very welll but once I got here the service was great, we did not not have to wait long for our drinks and I got the pretzels appetizer and it was delicious. Aerial our bartender was great! Highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Great example as why shouldn't always count on yelp to pick a new place to try.  Today was my 1st visit here.  I like the fact you are allowed to seat yourself.  Since it was a nice day with some cloud cover we chose to sit on the patio.  Our waitress Allison promptly greeted us and asked for our drink order.  I questioned her about the rotating taps and she immediately offered to bring a taster of any ones I would like to try.  After she brought our drinks we ordered our meals.  I had the Chicago Stockyards burger and my wife ordered the fish tacos.  The meals came when expected and were nothing less than awesome.  Prices are reasonable and looks like they have specials throughout the week for the bargain hunter.  I know being there on a Sunday afternoon was in our favor, but if your going to go here during peak times you should allow the staff some extra time.  I can also see with a seat yourself policy some patrons may go unnoticed with all the activity.   I will add this place to my rotation of regulars for sure.  It has a great atmosphere, plentiful menu, and drinks catered to all tastes."}
{"text":"I had the EXACT same experience as John R. Went here to get a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie across the street. The place was near empty and there were three waitresses. Got seated and waited on immediately. Ordered drinks, and it took them 15 minutes to come...no, not alcoholic drinks, two waters and an iced tea. This should have been a bad sign, but at this point we ordered food.  20 minutes go by...we flag down our waitress, to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minutes. She said our food would be out in a few minutes. Another 20 minutes, still no food, and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. We flag down another waitress, she says she will find our waitress, who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses. She finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later. She says she didn't even realize our food hadn't arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn't). After speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she \"definitely\" put our order in so it \"must have been given to someone else by mistake.\" Because they wouldn't have noticed that that WASN'T what they ordered? Seriously?  The waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. All that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. How generous! We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn't have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. Worst part? I opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. Of course.  However, I gave this place two stars instead of one. That's because my food, when I finally got it, was perfect. I had the Greek burger and it was huge, cooked exactly how I like it, with delicious toppings. I really wish I could come back here for the food but...hell no."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on Mother's day, waited for someone to greet and sit us. No one did. They just kept on walking past. Finally we asked a server and he said open sitting.   We sat down and it took 10 mins for a server. We had to get our own brunch menus.  Server delivered pancakes and look annoyed when we asked for syrup. We ordered nachos and asked for salsa. Salsa never came. Waited for our check for 15 minutes. Service is horrible. Food was ok. Definitely will never come back."}
{"text":"The star rating states \"Meh\" and Meh is about right.  I met friends here on a Friday night.  It was VERY loud.  We were glad outdoor patio seating was available because inside was too loud to be able to actually carry on a conversation.   It was clear the waitress was more interested in the bachelorette and birthday party tables near us then our little table of four.   Food is very pricey for what you get.  I ordered a shrimp appetizer and it was very clear they were frozen and low quality shrimp thawed and tossed on some poor quality salad.  The tortilla soup was pretty tasty, but not worth the price.   Drinks were extremely expensive for what you got.  My sangria was $10 and was very watered down.  The same glass at most other bars would have been half the price. Overall, there are so many places that are much better than Bar Louie, even right in Station Square.  Do yourself a favor and visit one of those places instead."}
{"text":"A nice little quiet restaurant to come in for lunch. I'm a little biased since in college my friends and I would come here for dollar burger night every Tuesday and that was the highlight of my shitty week. But I still recommend this place, always a fun time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and location for a sit down bar and grill. Love the spicy burger and side salad with house dressing and pretzel sticks with dipping sauce. Great Burger! And service is on top of refills!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had never been here before, so we decided to give it a try. The atmosphere was very fun and inviting and immediately our server Kayla approached us with a more than friendly greeting. Our service was phenomenal, Kayla was awesome. Food was great, prices were fair, and service was great. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This review is a little late but here goes. My work made reservations to have its Christmas party here last December. I'd say there was about 20 of us. My hubby and I were one of the last people to arrive and we were told by the hostess that my work did NOT have a large party that night but we were free to look around. We found  my coworkers in a back room, so not sure  what happened there. Our entire party ordered  shortly after, including drinks and some apps. The service was SO SLOW that one couple NEVER received their dinner and many people had to go to the bar for drinks. Most of the other meals came out one at a time and my hubby's meal was so screwed up he asked the waitress to just take it away. We all complained to the waitress who just said it wasn't her fault. Finally we got a hold of a manager who comped the entire group's bills. We still managed to enjoy ourselves but it was a huge disappointment!"}
{"text":"Even though Bar Louie is a chain, I'm really starting to fall in love with this place. Every once awhile, I just find myself wanting to come here for happy hours and to enjoy some drinks.  First, it's a GREAT happy hour location. They have great happy hour menus and there's always room and TV to watch games. Second, the food is pretty delicious. The calamari isn't the best, but it's a great deal for the happy hour price. The one dish i would definitely recommend is the CHICKEN TUSCAN PASTA! The flavors are great and who would've known that bars could make great pasta?  Either way, Bar Louie is a solid place to come for some chill nights with friends. The food isn't the best ever, but it's solid quality, solid price, and I always have a great time with friends here! Definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"Nice bar atmosphere. Ordered their shredded turkey sliders and jumbo shrimp appetizer. Both were excellent."}
{"text":"Don't even think about not getting the pretzel dippers its pretzel sticks with honey mustard, cinnamon butter, and a spicy queso dip. The queso is my favorite but they were all delish. I also got the bruschetta which was very garlicky but delicious. 5-7 M-F is 1/2 off appetizers so I was able to get both the pretzel sticks and bruschetta for 7 bucks as a meal. The menu had a pretty wide range- my friend very much enjoyed a pear and chicken salad. We didn't get drinks but some looked good..."}
{"text":"Great place to come when you're out in Downtown Cleveland late at night and would like a bite to eat.  I've always liked the atmosphere at this Bar Louie and have had much better experiences here than at the one in Legacy.   We started off with the trio dips and chips.  The trio of dips is salsa, queso, and guac.  As neither of us were fans of guac she happily substituted for a second queso which worked out nicely for us.  The chips were warm and flavorful and for not being a Mexican place the queso and salsa were very good.   We also had the Bavarian Pretzel Sticks which comes with cinnamon butter (the very best), queso, and honey mustard.  I was a little disappointed with the sticks as they tasted kind of hard and burnt, but in the past when I have had them they have been great. It could have been because it was later in the night they just weren't up to the par I remembered them being.  We ended with fish and chips.  I was surprised by the large portion that you got for the fish and chips. It was a solid choice, we would order again.   Our waitress was extremely pleasant and efficient.  I urge you to come here and spend some time looking at the menu, though it is a chain they do have a lot of different options of food you wouldn't find at a regular chain.  For drink choices highly recommend: S'mores Martini, Diva Martini, and 90 miles to Florida."}
{"text":"4 stars because We didn't try any food.  Our Server was Justin and he was great! Attentive, accomodating and personal!  Watermelon Margarita & Berry Mojito were both good. We will be back and try the food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in today to grab a drink and food before our movie started. It was a first time for both of us, drinks were great! My boyfriend tried the angry sailor and it was delicious! When we got our food we were highly disappointed... I got the Caesar salad, added breaded chicken and then I asked to add bacon. My boyfriend got the pork bbq sliders. There was hardly any dressing on my salad. When she put it down I was thinking to myself \"did they forget the dressing?.\" I literally had to look and find where the dressing was. There were just spots of Caesar like they just sprinkled it on there. It was just surprising to me that they would bring it out thinking there was actually dressing in it. The server also forgot to add my bacon and the chicken tasted like charcoal. Same thing happened for the sliders. Said there was bbq on it and there was hardly any and tasted very dry. Both of us had to ask for extra Caesar and extra bbq. We didn't have time to change anything or send it back so we just ate it. Tasted a little better when we got our sauces but all in all.. for the prices of your food, we were expecting way more with the necessary ingredients. I know this seems something small to complain about but we were starving and what we choose sounded so delicious and we were excited only to be let down. Maybe we just showed up on a bad day? Just wanted to post about our experience. Thank you."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday night. Almost empty. Why did it take 50 min to get my food???? Not acceptable. It's not the ritz! Staff nice bit that does not make up for slow food service."}
{"text":"My friends and I met for drinks one night and enjoyed ourselves.  I just had a couple beers and the soft pretzel appetizer.  It was really good.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I still like this place, the happy hour drinks are great, Try the Rat pack Martini with blue cheese olivies. The food is decent, they now have Pok√© on the menu, I have not yet tried it but I do love all things pok√©.  The service is a slow at times but always friendly. It's a decent 1st date type of place with a varied menu, and it will not break the bank."}
{"text":"My bf said I should be deducted yelp points for picking a place to eat purely on emotion and not checking yelp before. I would never had sat down knowing what I do know now. Service was very slow. We never had water, beer, silverware or napkins. The hummus app was good as always. The trio was gross. Guacamole awful. I ordered the sesame ahi tuna. It was cooked medium well and the rice tasted like Uncle Ben's, the veggies were mush. I wanted to be able to voice my disgust but never found the waitress. I use to eat here all the time when I lived in Pittsburgh, but this was very disappointing. It seemed they were having some difficulty with their support staff too. The bathroom had no toilet paper and was filthy. The food runner was juggling plates. Waitresses were not friendly at all. Then we got to see the train pass by for 10 minutes.  This was more like a prison sentence then an enjoyable afternoon out.  If the show Undercover Bosses is reading this then please take a hint! Still waiting on the bill....."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get good food and a great view of the river. The food is very good and lots of space to relax"}
{"text":"I recently ate here for lunch.  I came around noon on Thursday and was seated immediately.  The service was great and the food was really good.  I had the buffalo burger with tater tots, which was only about $10.  I would definitely recommend if you are in the area looking for a laid-back lunch locale."}
{"text":"Traveling for work and decided to stop in for a drink after a long day. I've legitimately been sitting here at an almost empty bar (4 other people) for 15 minutes and nobody has even acknowledged my presence. Seriously?!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch games.  Had about five tvs.  The best thing at bar louie is there 4-7pm weekday happy hour.  I wish they offered a late night happy hour also. The drinks on regular menu as well as food is overpriced for the quality.  The chicken nachos were stale.  The fatheads bumble berry small was over 6$.  So i'd probably only go here for happy hour."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times and never had a good experience. The service is slow and poor. The food is sub par and I left each time wondering why I gave it another try. I am just waiting for it to flop so a better place can move in."}
{"text":"Me and my coworkers come here pretty much every Tuesday for their 5 dollar burger deal. The service has always been awesome and their food is always on point. Ned the bartender is just amazing and always remembers exactly what I order when it comes to drinks. If you are hungry late at night the kitchen is open until after 1 am i believe!"}
{"text":"I'm sure this place is awesome when it's not busy, but it took our waitress 20 minutes to even get our non-alcoholic drinks, which was after we called her over and she rolled her eyes in annoyance. It took another server 45 minutes to get a table next to us's drinks. Food was good tho, just not worth an hour wait. Definitely understaffed when we went."}
{"text":"Not enchanted with the service.  I liked downtown better than Crocker park.  Sat so long the manager comped most of the tab but we sat there with a baby, and he was golden... we just did not eat much of our food because by the time food arrived, the baby was needing attention.     We sat over half hour before asking for a manager and drinks."}
{"text":"Fast efficient stop for food after a Pirates game. Great service and decent food at a price you would expect convenient to stadium venues!"}
{"text":"Not recommended. Bad service. When we walked in thought a funeral had just taken place. Waited at bar, no service, just loud music. Employees act like they don't want to be there, bad attitudes.Young boy at bar, rude to customers. One drink and we were OUT! Need to review management."}
{"text":"Love coming here for their $5 burgers on Tuesdays. Make sure you get a side of their AMAZING ranch! However, service on any day of the week takes forever. We have actually been \"forgotten\" by our waitress once."}
{"text":"Great service, happy hour is great. Dollar burgers in Tuesday's half off flat breads during happy hour. Come one come all great staff!"}
{"text":"Food took forever, ordered a burger medium, came out well, and fries were ice cold. Just come for drinks, and nothing else."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience of my life.  I am not being dramatic.  My companion and I sat at the bar where we were ignored to the point of hilarity.   My food was so bad that I took one bite.  No one ever asked how we were doing.  The bartender/server took my untouched meal with a sneer and did not inquire as to why I did not eat it.   We had \"bottomless\" mimosas that were only half way filled after asking several times for a refill.  Honestly it was like we were on candid camera.  It became comical of how over the top rude and inattentive the staff behaved.  We even tried to engage the female server (Kristina) by being friendly and asking questions.   That didn't work.... The best part was when she brought our change and slammed it on the counter.   We said thank you.... (Why I'm not sure) and she stormed off without acknowledging it. If you want terrible food and to be treated like a second class citizen, then this is your place!"}
{"text":"Meh.  Long waits for drinks and food.  Dishes are spotty like their dishwasher is too hot or not sanitizing properly, and I'd know, I use one everyday.  Chunks of solid food on my girlfriends wine glass.  Git a new one, spotty and streaky still, at least there wasn't any chunks on it.  Maybe I shouldn't be expecting Arrowhead Grill type service and cleanliness.  I mean,  Westgate hasn't been the standard for staying above stabdards..."}
{"text":"Unacceptable!  Walked in with friend that hadn't experienced Bar Louie... sit anywhere they said. Let's sit at the bar for faster service, I said.  8 minutes later ... 2 bartenders, 4 servers standing by ... no water offered, no drinks offered... We left to Yardhouse ... sat down and 30 seconds later, we were attended and 1 minute later we had our drinks ..  What am I saying? Go to Yardhouse instead."}
{"text":"Good Service . This place has become a weekend drill for me and my friends in Pittsburgh . Love their tempura shrimp . The food is sapid . Appreciation for their waitress Sehra , she remembers most of the customers ."}
{"text":"I had a surprise Happy Hour for my husband's 40th birthday yesterday evening. I had called around several weeks ago trying to find a location that would reserve an area for 20+ people and many were not accommodating at all, telling me they wouldn't reserve that big of an area on a weekend. After sending an email request to Bar Louie, one of the assistant managers, I believe her name was Nadia, contacted me to say that they would be more than happy to reserve an area. We had the couch area on the patio, and a few tables surrounding as well. It was perfect! My husband was genuinely surprised. We ended up having nearly 30 people, and the server, Kaelin, was absolutely fabulous! Keeping that many tabs straight is no easy feat. She was efficient and patient with all of the people who wouldn't hear her when she would call out another drink someone had ordered. Appetizers were all tasty, and the happy hour prices for both them and the drinks are great! Even though the majority of our friends are also from south east Gilbert like we are, they all commented they would make the drive back over because of the great service and atmosphere. Thank you, Bar Louie, for making my husband's 40th a success!!"}
{"text":"Yuck.  Yuck.  And more yuck.  Not a place for eating.  We sent a dish back, as did the table next to us.  The waitress couldn't have been more understanding.  The manager was brash and disagreeable.   I ended up eating take-out from an other restaurant.  ....that restaurant I DO recommend!  Bar Louie is a good place to grab a drink.  The sangria was ok.  The martinis and mixed drinks were good.   Will never come back."}
{"text":"The food was good I had the Voodoo chicken, but our waitress wasn't the friendliest and seemed like she didn't like her job very much or maybe had a problem serving us. We sat outside in the patio area which was nice. However, when I asked our waitress for the check, she disappeared and was nowhere to be found. After waiting for about 15 minutes, I went to the bar and asked them if they could get her which they did not and I just paid my bill to the bartender, which was odd. Again, good food, bad service!"}
{"text":"Worse service to be found ... and with hardly anyone else in the restaurant we wait 45 min for our food and then it was cold and wrong..."}
{"text":"Just left this place,  which was mostly a ghost town inside... However I sat for 10 mins before even being greeted. To make matters worse,  once my drink order was finally taken which consisted of a cocktail and a water, I sat for 15 mins before I finally walked out. And as I walked out I noticed there were no bartenders or servers in sight! For a slow Sunday afternoon, this was the worse service ever!"}
{"text":"Very slow service. It took more than 15 mins to 6 drinks. The place wasn't even  third full. They were out of Yuengling during happy hour... who runs out of Yuengling?"}
{"text":"Gosh is it really that hard to receive decent service from this place? Barstaff is in another realm and don't even have a sense of urgency. Horrible experience. Sat at the bar waiting for over half an hr and still my food never arrived. The bartenders wouldn't even come by and ask if I needed anything! Not one manager in sight! Never going back!!!! If I could give this place zero stars I would!"}
{"text":"This was our first night at Bar Louie, and we couldn't be more impressed. Xavier was our server tonight and he started the night off with a joke that set the entire mood to great. I had a southwest burger and my fianc√© had the fish and chips which both were outstanding. All in all great service, great food. If we weren't moving back to Florida we'd definitely come back here over and over. Also, it's not expensive at all! And a very pleasant atmosphere. Thanks for everything tonight."}
{"text":"Came here once before and ordered the sangria pitcher and it was delish! This time we focused on trying some different martinis, and a buffalo flatbread! The food was a great start to some martini sippin', our waitress was super outgoing and on top of her game! Both times I've come my waiter and waitress have been amazing and super fast paced. The food was gone in a second which must've meant something! The s'mores martini (not usually my go to choice) was amazing, and made me want to sit by a campfire and toast some up! Most definitely returning, would still love to check out the patio ambiance!"}
{"text":"The wait staff was great! The one star is for the hair I found in my food and the food was not that great. I don't plan to come back. The drink specials are $5 which is a steal and not too bad-tasted really good! Too bad about the hair I found in my food that really grossed me out."}
{"text":"This place sucks for so many reasons;  Slow service, even though there's barely anyone there, over priced beers, glasses that short you on the amount of beer you get, food that tastes like an average Applebee's,  but took longer to serve and add $5 to however much they would charge . The refills on soda aren't even free.    Ive eaten  here 3 times, and everytime I've over paid. Did I mention that it takes forever even if they're not  busy?"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful! Started out good but then after we didn't get our food after 40 min, we flagged down someone to inquire- was told \"it's coming out soon I'm not BS-ing you\" and then when I asked  our awful troll of a waitress what the hold up was (slow? short staffed?) she said \"it shouldn't be\" just as dumb as she could. She did get the manager who DID NOT APOLOGIZE for the awful service and nonchalantly said \"we'll take it off the bill\" after making some lame excuse of \"new management new employees\". When we finally did get our food, the slider buns were rock hard, loaded tots were cold as ice, and my medium burger was basically shoe leather it was so over cooked. DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR AND GO ELSEWHERE!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would. I went here about two weeks ago and had a terrible experience. When coming in, it took about ten minutes to get seated. Most of the restaurant was empty but there was trash and dirty plates on more than half of the tables, assuming they just had a rush. When we finally get seated it takes another fifteen minutes for anyone to even come take our drink orders. I originally ordered the pulled pork and Mac n cheese sandwich. The pork came out and looked and tasted old. I had then replace it with a club sandwich would should have had chicken, lettuce, bacon, tomato and mayo. It came out with chicken and mayo, nothing else. I spent a total of two hours at the restaurant and ended up not eating anything. My friend's food was cold and mediocre. Though they did take care of my bill, I definitely wouldn't return or recommend anyone to eat here."}
{"text":"The worse meal I have had in a very long time. Waited over forty five mintues for two sandwhiches. When we finally received our meal it was so greasy we were unable to eat. Would noy go back again!"}
{"text":"Went here recently for a happy hour. Much like other reviews state, this is an average bar/restaurant with average food and drink. I had the bruschetta to eat and it was a huge filling portion. It was OK. Nothing extraordinary to write about."}
{"text":"I have been here over a 1/2 dozen times now, and just love the food and service. The staff is nice & knowledgeable and the quality is above average.  Love the Loaded Tater tots, and lets just talk a minute about their Daily 1/2 price Happy Hours - Keep em' comin'. ..... mmmmmmmm yummy..."}
{"text":"Always had good service here, just use common sense. If you want the best Burger or your life, $1 Burger night might not be the best idea. Always friendly and helpful, quick to squeeze your order onto happy hour! Yummy bites and drinks too!"}
{"text":"Delicious martinis half off on Wednesdays!!!  Tried the Tickled Pink and The Fizz! Yummm!!! Food is tasty also!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! We were in a huge rush and Tara made sure our food came out quick so we wouldn't miss our flight. Fish n Chips were really good and that Double Melon martini tastes like a jolly rancher in case you're into that. Thanks again Tara!"}
{"text":"I tried Bar Louie on a Monday for lunch. It definitely looks a lot different than Blake's, much more open and spacious. The sign did say please seat yourself so we sat at a high top near the bar. For a lunch crowd there were a few business people and that's all.   I immediately recognized our waiter for some reason and turned out he worked at Bubba Qs. He was a good waiter, fast, and responsive. So I don't have any complaints about our service.   The food is pricey for a bar type of restaurant. I had the fish & chips for $13 which were good but small pieces of fish. For the money I just would have expected a little more food. But hey it was good.   The drink menu is large but so is the prices. I would recommend going during a happy hour. Other than that I don't think I'll be going back to Bar Louie anytime soon. There are so many other bar/restaurant places that I would like to try."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner or a beer. Definitely get there when Ellie is behind the bar.  She's super friendly, for someone from San Francisco."}
{"text":"I love Bar Louie, one of my favorite happy hour places in the area, however I was extremely disappointed after my visit last night. I ordered my usual; a clover and the hummus, tapenade and tzatziki plate. We got our drinks first of course, but when my plate came out I was completely disgusted to see that the cucumber they had served me was spoiled. It was dark in the restaurant but not dark enough to not be able to see that it was spoiled. When I pointed it out to the waitress she took the bad cucumber and brought back a new, crispy one. However, considering the dangers of E. coli in spoiled cucumbers I was shocked that she didn't even comp my meal. I hate to say it, but I will probably stay away from Bar Louie for a while."}
{"text":"The wife and I were here for New Year's and had a great time and enjoyed the food very much. We just stepped in the door this afternoon and sat at the bar which had 3 people working it and not one of them acknowledged us in the 4 minutes we were there. We left and went over to the Yardhouse where we were instantly served a drink and there's considerably more customers. Bar Louie no more from here on out."}
{"text":"I have loved Bar Louie for years!!!!  I used to always be at the $1 burger nights.  Since now I don't eat meat anymore there really aren't a lot of choices for me to choose from on the menu.  But they are very accommodating when I ask for things to be taken out (like cheese and mayo).  They do offer a portebello burger- I haven't tried one yet but I think on my next visit I will.  My friend and I decided to go to Bar Louie for drinks and also because I was so hungry!    Bar Louie has a great selection for drinks which is another reason why I enjoy coming here!  My friend and I both ordered a whiskey sour- which was quite delicious.  I of course ordered a large tater tot order for my appetizer and the grilled vegetable wrap for my meal.  Both were quite delicious and I had left overs for lunch the next day.  The reason I didn't give them all THE stars is because our waitress seemed kind of out of it.  She rarely checked on our table and other workers would deliver our food and drinks.  Outside of that we had a good experience."}
{"text":"I've ridden my bike here a lot on Tuesdays for $1 burger night.  Last night I decided that even for $1 burgers, it's not worth it.  When you come in, there's no hostess stand or sign that says to seat yourself.  Once you learn this, you seat yourself.  And then you wait...and wait...and wait for a server.  They are usually rushed and your order is often incorrect.  Last night my toppings were wrong and my guest got the wrong sauce.  And the quality isn't great.  The burger tasted like the kind that comes in a frozen bag of burgers at the grocery store.  I usually get the chicken breast (a great bargain at $1) but it's small and dry.  I asked our server if one of the many tvs could be put on the Pittsburgh Pirates game.  He replied \"When I get time.\"  I got up and asked the bartender who happily agreed.  I also had to ask the bartender to find a manager so we could pay our bill.  I almost had to tackle the waiter going by because he never even glanced our way.  But it's not this once -- it's always like this.  I'm going to pay full price in any other restaurant -- it's just not worth the bad service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Most flavorful Mac n cheese in Charlotte! Bartenders always treat me right, never had a problem there."}
{"text":"Great staff. Awesome tap selection!! Go early before Browns games.  Here we go Brownies here we go!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for St. Paddy's Day, and all I can add is more Meh. You get a nice view of the river and the city, but other than that it's not much to get excited about. Tourist Trap sounds about right. We didn't eat anything, we just drank."}
{"text":"I literally cannot stop raving about my experience at Bar Louie! This place is huge and offers so many great seating options! It's very clean, spacious, and trendy. I was in a party of 10, and we sat outside. Torriona was our server, and she was absolutely fantastic!!! She took such great care of all of us. When 10 people order different drinks, different meals, and ask for separate checks, it can be a server's nightmare and be very easy to mess up... but not for Torri! She really hooked us up! Not ONE of the 10 members of our party had a complaint. Between all of us, we had burgers, tacos, and lots of different appetizers. I tried a little bit of everything, and every single thing was delicious. Omg the bruschetta was by far the best thing I ate. Torri even brought us extra bread to use so we could eat every last drop of it lol. I would highly suggest everyone in Pittsburgh eat at Bar Louie. They get a 10/10 for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great atmosphere. Terrible service. There were less than 10 patrons in the whole restaurant so it wasn't an issue of being busy. Our server did not tell us about the drink specials. We ordered and appetizer when it did not come out before our food she asked if we still wanted it. We said no we did not. Another server told us about the drink specials where you get to keep the glass. When we asked our server she said that she didn't think we could keep the glass. She kept forgetting to bring us things we needed. When the salads didn't have dressing it took 2 trips back to the table before she remembered to bring it.  When we asked for our bill the appetizer was still on the bill. Luckily a manager attempted to right the wrongs and make us happy. The bill was corrected. The manager apologized and we got to keep the glasses! I will return to this establishment in hopes that the service is better next time."}
{"text":"I've been to Bar Louie a few times.  Most recently, my wife and I went to enjoy some appetizers and some wine.  Food - Our last visit we ordered three appetizers.....Cheeseburger Sliders, Hummus Dip, and Goat Cheese Dip.  They were all delicious.  However, the Sliders were a little overcooked and the goat cheese didn't have as sharp of a flavor as we would hope.  Service - Our server, Nicolle, was very helpful and personable.  She ensured that our glasses stayed full and that we were taken care of.  Atmosphere - This place is a bar/tavern.  There is a pool table & video games available.  There is also a nice sized patio, which i is where we ate tonight.....the weather was perfect.  Will we come back?  Yes."}
{"text":"I go here often because I work down in the waterfront, the staff is very friendly and nice. The drinks are very expensive but that's every Bar Louie. The one in homestead takes forever for food, the wait is ridiculous. I spent almost 45 minutes for some nachos. It's cool for a pre game and they have dollar burgers on Tuesday, and dollar brews on Wednesdays. It's very close to the movie theater so good for a date night! But just make sure you give yourself a little time because the service is a bit bad."}
{"text":"I'm not just rating the place, but the whole experience.  I met a guy here on our first meeting after chatting online for a couple weeks.  We had a great afternoon. We only ordered lunch but spent about 2 hours eating it and talking at a table near the window towards the river.  Still dating the guy 3 years later."}
{"text":"I've been to plenty of Bar Louie's but this one was by far the worst. I stopped in before a Pirates game and was surprised to see it was pretty dead. That should have been a good indication that this wasn't going to go well. I grabbed a seat at the bar which literally only two other patrons were at. The bartender took over 10 mins to greet me. I'm not sure what she was doing but she was so slow. As it picked up a bit she seemed to get in the weeds pretty fast. Icing on the cake was when I asked for their gluten free menu which Bar Louie has she had no clue what I was talking about. Either she's just clueless or their training is terrible. Either way, I left and had dinner next door instead."}
{"text":"Oh boy! Having to leave here. Service not so good and they are out of half of what our group wants to eat. Probably would have made it work, but took them quite some time to let us know. Lots of other choices around here to deal with this scene. Out of here...."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new so we stopped in here and when we get here they tell us to seat ourselves which isn't a problem but all the empty tables needed to be bussed so we stood next to one for about five minutes and we didn't get acknowledged so we sat down and moved the drinks and check out of the way, finally their server comes over another ten minutes later and clears the table. She leaves and comes back with waters and we asked for a rag to wipe down the table and she huffed and puffed. It took 15 minutes to get drinks and over 40 minutes for our food and the server never checked on us in between. Food came with out some of the sides so we had to flag down the server to get sides. Overall the food wasn't the greatest and the service was horrible. I would understand if they were busy but over half the tables were empty."}
{"text":"I am reviewing the service only.  It was slow......  Okay came on 12/21 so the entire Marketplace was crazy/parking. Bar Louie wasn't that busy considering it was prior to happy hour but the service was super slow, I got my water right away but it took a several minutes to get my drink order and when my friend came our waitress totally disappeared that she went to the bar to order her drink.  Again, the service was too slow that day."}
{"text":"I just found my new Tuesday night spot! All burgers are $5 every Tuesday after 5:00PM.   My friends have been coming here for a while and I was finally able to join them and I loved it.   I am not a fancy burger guy so I just got the cheeseburger. Cooked to order and prepared how you like it.  The burger special also comes with fries or tots. You may also upgrade to any of their sides for $1 more. (The $1 upgrade price is always available with entree purchase.) Since I was counting calories, I opted for the mac and cheese. Pretty darn good!   My burger came out hot a juicy and is served with the traditional trimmings.  Tuesday night was packed, probably for the burger special. It is also open seating so plan accordingly.   I can't wait to return next Tuesday or perhaps another night to try more of their menu items.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Found this bar Louie in my search of a decent bar with cheap beer. Nothing worked out in the area so I settled with bar Louie. Not too bad if you don't mind paying an arm and a leg for \"rough around the edges.\"  Upon entry we were greeted by a man without a personality and he told us to seat ourselves. We received service fairly quickly from a waitress who was pretty down to earth, she didn't play the act fake game.  Beer was cold, food was okay. Overall, yes I would go back but I would try to find something else first."}
{"text":"Food is inconsistent. Service is poor. Never going back. Brought out wrong drinks. No kids menu because their printer wasn't working. Food over cooked. Been to other locations and this one clearly struggling in the kitchen and service. Probably due to poor management."}
{"text":"My daughter in law and I went here for lunch today.  The service was wonderful.   Had the pretzel sticks for a appetizer.  They were really goid with three dipping sauces.  Then we had burgers for lunch.  It was juicy and cooked to perfection.  The bun was a bit had and ended up removing the top, but it had a great atmosphere.  I would love to go back with all of our kids for dinner."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for dinner on a Friday night. Stopped in and asked the bartender behind the bar to point us in the direction to where the front is to be seated and she said it was open seating, inside and outside.   We decided to sit outside to enjoy the nice weather. However we ended up sitting outside for at least 15 minutes patiently until we got frustrated because no waitress/waiter came around. We noticed tables behind us and there was one server trying to catch up and apologizing to those tables for the delay in service. It frustrated me because we still were without waters. Finally my friend goes inside to get the attention of a staff member and a lady says she will be right out. After 5 minutes of waiting, (I think that's long enough) no one still comes out. We sat for another 5 minutes until I went in. I went in to the bar waiting for help but no bartender was on that side and I had noticed 4 staff members on the other side talking to each other. I didn't want to be rude but I went and asked if someone could come service us as it's been a long time now. One girl says she will be right out.   She comes out and asks for our orders. Now I'm not sure if we were her table or her section or how it works or if she just decided to come help us, but she brought no waters with.   We both ordered a drink and I placed an order for an entree. The drinks took a while to come out but surprisingly the food was brought over to me right after she placed down our drinks. That was kind of scary. I ordered the voodoo pasta that came with noodles, shrimp, sausages, and bell peppers. The pasta was cold but I was starving so I ate it. It wasn't bad but it lacked flavor and it came out way too quick.   Water refills came so I am thankful for that but it took her a long time to bring the check, to pick up the check, and to bring back the check.   Note to self: should have checked the reviews on this place before coming! Most likely will not be back again"}
{"text":"Amazing northern-style spinach dip. Best chicken street tacos I've had in a while. Plus bubbly. Great stop!"}
{"text":"Are you guys hiring for managers? B/c you need one. Sign said seat yourself - many tables weren't bussed; waitstaff not around much; food marginal. Drinks were OK. Waiter was pleasant, but we had to ask another one to find him to get our check. This is the second time I've been to this location- service was poor the first time but the food was better. Prob won't come back!"}
{"text":"Beer is great, TV's, environment is great, food is good. Prices decent, staff is decent, Wednesday is $5 burgers, definitely 4 stars"}
{"text":"The 1 star is for my salad & lack of Manager service.  The waitress did her job well, her Manager left her unsupported. My friend and I stopped in for lunch yesterday (a Sat). She ordered the BLTT - which she enjoyed. I ordered the blackberry, orange & brie salad. The salad was $8.50 and came out looking like a small side salade. I had anticipated getting a salad as a meal. When I asked the waitress about the size, she said it was because of the quality of ingredients...there were 4 brie triagles of approx 1/2 inch, two 1/2 pieces of orange, 5 blackberries and a tablespoon of walnuts.  And I'm being generous. I understand I'm in a bar & grill ordering a salad - however, these days that doesn't seem to be an issue in most locations. You get a decent salad. Not with this one.  The waitress said she'd send the manager over. My only suggestion that I was going to make was let people know that this isn't a meal size salade - that it's more a small side salad.   After this initial conversation - we never saw our waitress again. After a good 15 minutes a lady stopped by and asked if we wanted more water and took our plates. We then asked for the bill. The same lady brought the bill. Then our waitress stopped in to pick up the payment and asked if the Manager helped us or took the salad off the bill. (I wasn't looking to not pay, I just wanted them to inform their customers) We said we hadn't seen the Manager - she informed us the lady that took our plates and brought us water was the Manager. She had never said a word to us. Introduced herself or asked any questions. The waitress was stunned and very apologetic. She was a bit at a loss of what to do.   We left a decent tip for the waitress, It's not her fault that management is clueless and unprofessional.  Won't be back - too many other options."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with a group of 12 for my dad's birthday and we had a great time. Matt was our server and he was great. There were a few hiccups along the way but nothing that wasn't immediately addressed and fixed. My husband and I shared a Philly Burger and fish and chips. Both were really good! My Dad had the VooDoo Pasta and really liked it. All in all everyone had a great time and Matt was awesome. Thanks for making my Dads Birthday dinner great!! We will def be back."}
{"text":"I am normally a Bar Louie Fan - my husband and I LOVE the one in Tampa.  This location needs a lot of work.  We went on a Friday evening before a show at the Improv.  We were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat.  We never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received.  We got there at about 6:40/6:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up, but I would say that the bar was not even 3/4 full.  There were also plenty of empty tables.  This should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction.  But we grabbed a table.  I am not a clock watcher, so I am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5-7 minutes.  Then we got our drinks at 7:04.  The only reason that I know is because I was looking at my phone because my husband and I wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of Happy Hour.  That went out the window.  When our friends for there; they ordered drinks.  We finished them and left.  The server was nice, that is not the issue.  The issue was how GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED they were.  They had two bartenders on (I think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers.  The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with \"this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped\".  That is a sign that you need more staff.  I have never had this happen at any other bar before.  Get more staff.  We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing.  Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55.  We ended up going to the Improv and got food there.  Bar Louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our Pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely horrid at this place.  They understaff so expect 45-1hr minimum for food and usually 20 mins for service. Have walked out before, figured I'd give them another chance because they have a good tap list that's affordable. Half of the food was cold when we got it and severely overcooked as it had been sitting all day (the beans AND chicken were bone dry).   Shame, because had a couple of good experiences here too, great prices on happy hour. I guess come here when it's not dinner time, the weekend, or busy in general."}
{"text":"Poor service! Maybe is the location because we always go to the one in Tempe and never had any problems before. We sat down for 15 minutes  and never get service."}
{"text":"We always come here before the game at the cardinals stadium and it's a hip little place. Drinks here are really good. Had the smores martini and it was really good. Food wise is very expensive and not that great tasting. We had the pretzel appetizer and the pretzel sticks were cold to the taste and the dipping sauce was kind of gross. Would come again just for the drinks and hang out."}
{"text":"Pretty much just meh. Food was ok, nothing to write home about. Drinks were overpriced even for Legacy Village. The real reason I won't be back was the terrible service we had for dinner. We saw our waitress a total of 4 times, once to take our order, once to bring our food, once after I flagged her down for a water and finally to bring our bill. When she did bring the bill she didn't ask if we wanted dessert or another drink. It's a shame because we usually have a few after dinner drinks so her loss on the tip."}
{"text":"This is a great oasis in the midst of a vast area devoid of good bars...at least bars open and with much population.  For the business traveler a bar may be needed at any time.  This is a nice complex with much to do, but the bar provides a variety of characters into the night."}
{"text":"Happy Hour at Bar Louie is just great!  $5 martinis (they've got over a dozen!) $3 drafts, $4 wine and all small plates are half-price!  Plus, Happy Hour is M-F until 7:00, later than the other bars across the way!  The food is really tasty - especially the sliders!  The crabcake ones with lemon aioli are my fave.  The Zucchini Chips are really tasty too.  Oh, and the Bavarian Pretzel sticks are really good - 4 huge soft pretzel sticks with dipping sauces.  The Hot Wings are tasty, and the quesadillas are HUGE!  My girlfriends and I have only ever sat outside.  The patio has a great view - and you get to see the underside of the planes arriving at McCarran up close!  Yes, it's a tad noisy sometimes, but it's worth it for the fresh air and lovely view.  Happy Hour at Bar Louie is a fantastic way to start the weekend!"}
{"text":"Stopped there yesterday for lunch with some friends.  Very nice inside.  The reason why I give it 2 stars is our waitress.  We were the ONLY ones sitting inside and the service took forever.  When my friend asked what the special was on tap she said she didn't know because she doesn't like beer.  I thought we were being punked.  He asked for the special anyways. She comes back with the beer 15 minutes later and he asked if she knew what it was.  She said she didn't know. He asked her to ask the bartender and she finally told him.   The poor guy also got his meal and it was the wrong burger.  So.. by the time we were done eating she came out with the correct meal.  He said thanks, she goes \"no problem\".  Not even an apology.   Mind you, there is NOONE inside of this place.  I couldn't believe it.   I'll stick with the Bar Louie in Station Square.  They need to get their crap together there."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were pretty good but the service was terrible. We came in around 6 PM for dinner. It took 20 minutes to get our drink orders in. Another 15 minutes for drinks to arrive and 2 of them were missing. Got the appetizers ordered and they came around the same time as the missing drinks. Had to flag the server down in desperation to order our food. The server never came came back to see if we wanted to order more drinks. I had to go to the bar to get lemon for my tea. Food finally arrived and 3 of the meals were wrong. One burger was missing sauce and my coworker had to ask 3 times before he remembered to bring it. It's now 8 PM and we are just finishing our meal. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Came here for a impromptu lunch a few weeks ago and was disappointed. One server was on duty and she  disappeared for most of our lunch which meant no beverage or even water refills, slow service and just ok food. Maybe it was the time of day, but the place seemed a bit unkempt and lacked of any sense of urgency - and not in a laid back way. It won't be on my list of places to return."}
{"text":"Great drink specials, food is above standard for bar food, and seat and location is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place at least 3 stars because the food is so good, prices are fair, it's a nice ambiance, but the the service was just soooo slow. We sat inside on a Sunday evening around 5 pm, not that busy -- 4 people in our party. The server dude was nice and attentive at first, but it took 30 mins for our food to come out, and then he didn't check on us until 25 minutes later and finally filled our waters. It was like he forgot about us, was nowhere in sight. Luckily all our food was perfect and we didn't need anything besides water refills. The chicken Thai flatbread was really good, crunchy thin cracker crust. Very spicy with the jalape√±os, I picked the rest off after a few bites. My husband said his burger was fine but tasted like something he could have grilled at home. Spinach artichoke dip was on point, loved the huge chunks of real artichoke in it. Can't get over how long we had to wait for the server to check up on us, though. I'd go here again and sit at the bar to order food and maybe the bar tender would be more attentive."}
{"text":"Won't be coming back. Service was decent, had to ask for refills & just wasn't overly helpful. Ordered the BLTT for 10.79 and asked to us avocado for the turkey. The sandwich came out with two tomato slices and a tiny piece of super hard (not even close to ripe) avocado with the Pitt attached. Asked for more tomatoes and avocado and was charged extra for that! Someone else ordered boneless wings and got bone in, but we didn't ask for new ones because the food took so long the first time. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Ate at Bar Louie in the Westgate Entertainment District recently with a family group. Just walked in, first time, didn't know anything about Bar Louie.  Nice atmosphere, good happy hour prices. They were hosting a local brewery and offering discount prices all night. The food was tasty. Service pretty good, but had trouble getting the check when we were ready to leave."}
{"text":"OH bar louie.  A friend of mine told me that this place comes from the mid west or the east. Being Californian I was ignorant. But About 4 not 5 the happy hour started. I went with the Mangojito (mango Mojito) It was very sweet so ladies... try it.  The rum lovers Mojito is no lie. It's 90% rum 10% leafs.  I tried the Mario sandwhich which is great but for those on budget honestly sharing one sandwhich between two is a great idea.   Bottom line, it's a little pricey but it's worth in. And a great Alt to Blue Marrtini."}
{"text":"I would give a 4 star review for the quality of the food, but I am still appalled at how my wife and I were ignored when we came here the other day. Today our server was very helpful and attentive, so I hope my last experience was an aberration. My wife ordered the \"Diva\" Martini and I had a glass of Martin Codax Albari√±o, both were great. Our appetizers and entrees were both delicious as well. I'll give these guys another chance definitely."}
{"text":"The pros and cons of getting acquired by Sun Capital are clear: the consistency and menu improvements are a plus, the management definitely runs a tighter ship; but the drinks are much more measured, profit margins are monitored at the plate level. Not a bad thing because its how you run a restaurant - but it's not the Bar Louie it used to be."}
{"text":"I am honestly disappointed to have write this review. I have been here several times and always had great service and great food, until today. I always order the calamari appetizer and normally it is really good. Today it was HORRIBLE! Our entire order was cold and tasteless. The calamari was cold and seemed like it was sitting out before being brought to the table. The server Victoria didn't seem that busy but but she never really checked on us until she came to give us our checks. Will I be back? Maybe. I can say it will not be my first choice any longer. With this location being at Tempe Marketplace there are many other options that I can choose from going forward."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here the other day around 1:30. For how empty it was I would expect the service and wait time for food to have been way better. Food was decent, typical chain restaurant food. More than likely will not return due to how slow it was."}
{"text":"If you go here, sit outside and enjoy the beautiful view of Pittsburgh! We came here for drinks but the food looked good. Wednesday is their $1 beer special and $5.50 martini night. The martinis are good. The sangria was.... Eh......tasted flat and syrupy. Not what I expected from a sangria for $10."}
{"text":"Bar Louie in Station Square is a great place to go for lunch.  I always get the Voodoo Chicken sandwich with tater tots ('cause it's awesome).  Like every Bar Louie, they have multiple TVs and this one has a really good view of the river and a nice area for al fresco dining if the weather is right.  Service at the bar is always good and they always seem to have specials."}
{"text":"I went to Bar Louie this past Friday for a happy hour.  I enjoy wheat beer so I ordered a Hoegarden, which I will say was fresh and delish at Bar Louie.    When our group arrived (around 5:30 PM) we were able to make conversation and hear each other easily, until they turned the music on really, really, really loud.  I must say that I'm really confused by this, b/c it's clearly NOT a dance club so I don't know why they turn the music so damn loud!?!?!  At this point, we felt like we were screaming just to hear each other.  The selection of music was Top 40 which I like, but here's a suggession turn it down unless you want to clear out all the seating and change this from \"Bar\" Louie to \"Club\" Louie!"}
{"text":"It's my 1st visit here at this location. When we 1st walked in someone told us to sit anywhere we wanted. We did that and was immediately told to move because the tables were reserved. We moved to another table and waited 5 mins for someone to show up. Our waiter Anthony was very nice. We ordered drinks took 20 mins to come out the waiter apologized for the wait and said something about the bar dropped the drinks and he talked to the manager to come talk with us - mgr never showed up.   We finally got to place our food order but after 30 mins he stopped by to say he didn't know what was taking so long and apologized again - once again he said he spoke to the manager. When our food finally came out it was cold and not good, we sent it back and cancelled the order. The mgr did come out and apologized & took care of bill. We left after being there over an 1.5 hrs to find something to eat at another restaurant that wasn't cool."}
{"text":"Wait staff has always been great here. I enjoy the food, for the most part. Today- my party was sat at the booth nearest the expo line/kitchen. We watched a man work this expo line and repeated wipe his nose, adjust himself in many places, grab the rag and wipe the counter, and wipe his left hand all over himself. While we sat there and observed this, we asked our waitress if the man expoing food was the manager...she responded with \"yes, why\". So we briefly just told her what we observed...if for nothing else so that he could be aware of what was going on. (I mean come on...your expo line is completely open). She apparently calls him in the back and he decides it would be super masculine and alpha of him to come stomping over to say \"just to give you guys a heads up, I'm wearing a glove\", threw up his right hand and then pranced away. Cool bro, indeed you do have ONE glove on your right hand...but how about your left hand? Also, having a glove on and repeatedly grabbing a dirty rag and scratching your head and face does not make that acceptable. That was handled completely inappropriately...but I'm glad you were able to come make a little scene for yourself. Wait staff is great, food is generally good, drinks are ok, but management clearly feels like they are held to a different standard."}
{"text":"Bar Louie is a good stand by in the Warehouse District when I'm too lazy to leave the neighborhood.  Food is okay, service is good and beer list is surprisingly pretty good.  Burgers are a safe bet, always pretty good, but not quite wow. I do like the Luigi, Bar Louie's version of a philly cheesesteak, though it can't really be compared to an actual philly cheesesteak."}
{"text":"I've been here twice (at slow periods of the day) and I really liked the food. The service is ok, nothing really bad though being there during a slower period the waiting staff doesn't have as much going on. A bit more expensive then some places, but not really that bad for a place to eat at every once in a while."}
{"text":"Truly ok, but I doubt I will be back a variety of different bar foods. I went for my sisters birthday and tried calling to hold a table and was told they were booked up on reservations. When we got there it was not crowded at all and maybe a lot of the customers were invisible because I'm not sure abt booked and maybe they had came once we left.   The pitcher of sangria was ok."}
{"text":"I stopped in on Sunday night after a game. It was packed and we had to find our own seats. I expected service to be awful right away but our server was great. I was actually surprised.   The food however was not good. I got the lettuce wraps and it was almost too salty to eat. My fianc√© got a burger that he asked for medium well but came out medium rare. An honest mistake considering how loud it was. But the food server didn't even ask if he wanted to send it back she just did. And they just threw the burger back on the grill for a few minutes. The end result was a well done dry as hell puck.   I've only ever been to Bar Louie when other people want to go. I usually try to talk them out of it. It's never an option for me personally."}
{"text":"Who serves romaine lettuce with lettuce wraps....and to top it off the shrimp lettuce wraps were extremely salty. I ordered the brisket sliders and they were ok.  The brisket was cold. Their special barbecue sauce which you had to be 21 to have was ok.  For this being a martini bar. My dirty martini was mediocre,  Such a cool bar.  I agree with everyone else why is this place not packed on a Friday night.  Oh yea and I think our waitress must have had a bad day or doesn't like her job. :/"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure you know what Bar Louie is. But if you don't it's basically a sports bar with good food, at least better than what your average sports bar would have. They also have a lot of options on their food menu.   I like this location because it's one of the few places downtown that's open super late (kitchen is open until 1:30) and still has good quality food.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Its like the Jack of all trades when it comes to downtown restaurants if you know how to use it.  Marques what do you mean?! I thought it was just a so so downtown establishment that people use to get drunk on the weekends?  Well I wont dispute this but saying that is like saying toilet paper is only for blowing your nose (it works and lots of people use it that way but that's not its primary function.)  This place can do it all!  Family in town and you need a place to grab food before or after the Walk for the Cure/Marathon/Browns/ Cavs/Tribe/Casino........Bar Louie.  College pals visiting and looking for a place to grab a drink before heading out for a night on the town.........Bar Louie.  You and your co workers want to blow off some steam after a long day at the office........Bar Louie  Working late and looking for a place to grab a beer and a quick meal before heading home...........Bar Louie.  Want to watch the game and maybe have an appetizer or two you guessed it......Bar Louie.  I could go on for days but I think you get the point.   There is no situation this place cant handle.    Now while Bar Louie can do all of this for you its much like a smartphone......its only as powerful as its user.  Consider this your manual. There is only one instruction in this manual and it reads: Use common sense.  Your not going to be able to use this place for family on a Friday or Saturday night.  Your downtown and there are going to be people here to party and they don't care that its aunt Whitney's birthday.  They will ruin your night and embarrass you in front of your loved ones.  Do use it for this on a weekday when downtown is a virtual ghost town.  Do not think your going to be able to watch the last seconds of the game that's in OT at 11pm on a Saturday night.  You are the only one there that cares and that drunk bachelorette party is more concerned with getting their round of pink drinks than moving out of your way to see a buzzer beater.  Do use it for this on a Tuesday night when you can have a dollar burger and watch the game in peace along with the rest of the fans there who know every players stats. You see Bar Louie is much like NPR there's a little something for everyone you just have to know when to tune in.  If you keep this in mind and use a little common sense when planning your next visit I'm sure you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"All I have to say is WOW. About time we have a decent restaurant establishment in Westgate besides the very few we have. The food was phenomenal and the drinks were just as equally amazing. It is really beautiful inside and service is awesome. They have a big menu full of great food and creative drinks. I hope they can keep the quality. It seems that when new restaurants start here they end up not being as good as when they first opened only months later. Very excited to see what comes of this place. I loved my first visit so far. The pineapple sangria is to die for. I will be back no doubt!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday morning. My friend and I sat at the bar area. Pretty empty throughout the restaurant, but it was before noon on a Saturday. I had their mac and cheese grilled cheese sandwich (and added pulled pork--so worth it), which was definitely something different. The service was good, friendly, and attentive. Our food also came out quickly with decent sized portions. Not sure what this place runs like during busier times, but I was pleasantly satisfied."}
{"text":"I met up with a few friends here on a Friday evening around 8 pm.  BL is located right across from the Hilton hotel in the University area.  The atmosphere felt grown up which I can appreciate, lively and not at all stuffy.  It has a sports bar meets martini bar kind of feel.  I say this because the decor is actually nice it has a similar feel to a jazz lounge but the bar placement is the middle of floor and there are TV's all around it which gives it a sports bar feel.  What I ordered was good, blackened salmon sliders and sweet potato fries, uh yeah can you say YUM!  The salmon tasted fresh and was not dry and I was happy.  My favorite part was the live music at 9, the band plays in a small area to side and they were playing jazz music for the most part.  My one complaint that I hope improves is the service, the waiter would leave for LONG periods of time and not return.  To give a fair assessment-my party was fairly large and did not all arrive and order at the same time so this may have added to the lackluster attention.  All in all great job Bar Louie, I'll be back"}
{"text":"Proximity to home is this place's only real redeeming quality.  And, it's at Legacy Village which keeps the clientele decent.    I've been here too many times because it's close to home and close to work and unfortunately, I know quite a few people whose faces light up when you say \"Bar Louie.\"  But the food is really quite bad and the beers overpriced.  This is not the type of place where I would order a cocktail.  Under any circumstances.  I did once, and gagged it down... never again.  I forgot... there is one other redeeming quality.  Tots.  The day after our company's Christmas party, our department admin took mercy on my soul and ordered me the loaded tots as an add-on to another order for a working lunch.  They were covered in bacon, scallions, and either sport peppers or baby jalapenos, and came with a to-go bowl of chili con queso.  They were not very crispy (how could tots be good 25 minutes out of the fryer?) but they tasted alright and more important, they cured my hangover.  When Bar Louie is delivered to my office as a cure for previous night's excesses, it is 4 stars.  When I am forced into the establishment and to drink overpriced beer, it is 1 star.  That is a 2.5 average, and since most of their business comes from the actual restaurant, I'm rounding down.  Sorry Bar Louie.  It's OK... so many people love you.  You'll be fine."}
{"text":"Mostly the locals come here. Best part while I'm in town was Weds nights with $1.25 beers but they took that away. The bartenders are nice and friendly. But when it gets crowded, it's like a college atmosphere. But it's any typical Bar Louie."}
{"text":"Came here last night for happy hour and discovered a new gem... $5 burgers on Tuesdays. And not a tiny, happy hour size burger, like their full menu size, normally $10-12, burgers. So. GOOD! I strongly recommend to anyone that is hungry for a big meal & craving a burger on Tuesdays. Pairs great with $4 wine and beer for happy hour :-)"}
{"text":"So bad. The bartender was so pissed at something more like she has either been here forever and needs a break or just a bad attitude. We're watching the kitchen and three plates have been sitting for about 15 min. This is the 3rd time I've been here I don't know why I came back hoping it's changed. This place just seems like it needs a good floor manager to run the staff. I feel the drama from everyone lol. I won't come back. We've been here for an hour and a half and have seen no manager on the floor. I don't want the servers to get in trouble for this because they need a leader! Where is the manager? So bad.  Update- just asked the staff where the manager is, they only have one floor manager on a Saturday night!? And they are not even a \"manager\" she's a key holder. :( And the GM is rarely here. SAD. Just speaks volumes for this company. You can't blame the staff for bad attitudes."}
{"text":"Shout out to BAR LOUIE, for being one of the very few restaurants that were open on Christmas Eve. I ordered \"The Louie Turkey Burger\" which was juicy and delicious. Service was a little slow but the waitress made up for it by being friendly and suggesting dishes.   On Tuesday nights order Burgers for $5!!!"}
{"text":"Courtney was awesome the staff that followed was amazing!! I appreciate this place, especially after a long work week!! 5 stars"}
{"text":"We have one in our area and have yet to visit, but have heard great things.  It was seat yourself, so we grabbed a high top at the bar.  I got a cucumber gimlet and requested light on the simple syrup...he got a dirty martini, the unfortunate thing was maybe because I asked for lite syrup this made it a shallow pour.  Regardless, it was good.  Except the second round of both our drinks were about an inch shallower than the first, so I would have to say the biggest negative was inconsistent pouring.  However the food was good and our waitress delightful so it was not a total loss.  But were keeping in mind that maybe this is a better place for a few beers."}
{"text":"Catrina recommended I come in to happy hour and I'm so glad she did! Great drinks, cheap prices, fun atmosphere! Thanks for the great service Catrina! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife & I recently moved in an apartment down the street, and after a long day of unpacking & setting up the house, what better to do than walk and get a beer or two. Next to Bar Louie was a cheesecake factory & another Irish bar - I don't know which was better describes the epitome of a chain.  The wait staff treated me like they were doing me a favor by serving me a beer,the man sitting next to me continued to stare and me & my wife & listen to our conversations & they charged me for more beers than I had.  The only saving grace was that the deals were good:  Dos-x were only $3 a pop & the chicken nachos were only $5.  The problem with $5 nachos is that they are nasty - liquid cheese & soggy chips. If you're in the neighborhood & can walk there, check it out.  If you have to make a trip of it, you'll be quite dissapointed."}
{"text":"It's a good spot to meet up for drinks. They reserved a 16 person table for us for our friend's birthday on a Saturday night. Also we saw the Cavs coach and Super Pimp (local celeb). Pretty cool!  Maybe I'm a food snob. I don't know. But the food here is bad. The last bite of my Voodoo Sandwich tasted like hot dogs. And my girlfriend's seasonal Lemon Chicken? Bland and uninspired.  Find somewhere else to eat, come here for drinks."}
{"text":"Food is descent, like the spinach and artichoke dip, the sliders are ok, burgers ok, the meatballs and flatbreads are good.  I go here sometimes to watch football as it doesn't get packed like Zipps and the location is helpful if you have family who wants to do other things than watch football.  The service is hit and miss.  I've been the Bar Louie's in Chicago and the food in the Tempe location is better.  Happy hour prices are ok, they were better in their Chicago Taylor St. location but the food wasn't good."}
{"text":"We second the vote on the pineapple sangria, great place very good service ,server Marisa was awesome as was the manager, finally  a nice place to go to at westgate"}
{"text":"I stopped by here last night last night with my fiance and two other dining companions for dinner.  We arrived at shortly after 7 PM and walked right into a fairly empty restaurant.  Since no one was at the hostess station and it didn't seem like anyone was going to be, we ended up seating ourselves in a rounded booth.  The restaurant is pretty large with a huge center bar and with a number of rounded booths facing it on one side and some tables on the other.  We were greeted almost immediately by the server.  He got us our drinks in a short amount of time and we were ordering our food within minutes of being there which was good since our dining companions were in a bit of a hurry.  For dinner I decided to order the BBQ ranch salad with chicken while everyone else at the table ended up ordering appetizers.  After a little bit longer of a wait for our food than we were expecting, it arrived and we asked for the checks while promptly starting eating.  The waiter came back with the check about a minute later and we had our payment ready shortly after that.  My BBQ ranch salad was decent although I wouldn't have been able to tell you it was BBQ ranch afterwards.  What I really loved about it was all of the toppers that provided it some texture and flavor, especially the bacon, onion rings and tortilla strips.  By the time I had finished eating my salad the waiter still had not come back to check on everything.  As a matter of a fact I couldn't see anyone that worked in the restaurant out in the front of the house.  We ended up looking around for about 5 minutes before finally seeing a waitress which we flagged down for a to-go box which was promptly delivered by her.  After waiting a few more minutes our dining companions ended up leaving cash as a payment and left since our waiter was nowhere to be found.  My fiance and I ended up waiting about another 10 minutes before we once again flagged down the same waitress to get our waiter so that we could pay our bill and leave.  I seriously have never seen a restaurant not have anyone out in the front of the house for as long a period of time.  If we had been so inclined to walk out without paying (not that we would ever do that), I honestly believe we could have been gone for quite a while before anyone would have ever noticed.  The bottom line for me is that I will not be heading back to Bar Louie again in the future.  While the food itself is probably worthy of 3 stars (A-OK by Yelps standards) and wouldn't prevent me from coming back the service certainly will."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best happy hour offers Ive seen in a while. $5 burgers/ specialty martinis, and half off apps on Tues? Yes please.  About half their taps had been pulled when we went, but they did have a good selection left. I went for the Tickled Pink martini though, which was delicious.  As a table, we started w/ the popcorn w/ truffle butter. SOOOOO delicious. I may be tempted to get some of it to go the next time I go to the TMP Harkins to see a flick. My friends throughly enjoyed their meals: the Chicago Stockyard burger, Mac & cheese w/ bacon, Shrimp po'boy, and regular burger. My husband was very happy that he could get a side of (or sub his fries for) the mac and cheese.  I however wasnt too impressed w/ my meal. I had the Turkey, ham, and brie w/ tots. It was supposed to come w/ dijon mustard and blackberry jam on it...90% mustard. I couldnt even taste the jam. Part of the reason I ordered it was that it sounded like an interesting combo. It was also kind of an awkward sandwich to eat being that the parmesan bread it was on was just a french roll turned upside down w/ parmesan cheese melted on whats usually the inside. My tots tasted like they werent fully cooked too.  Lastly, our bartender was kind of dense (we sat at the bar while waiting for the rest of our group to get a table), but our server was awesome. I also really like what they did w/ the space formerly known as Darcy Magees. It seemed way more inviting and much bigger than DM.  Ill go back, but Ill be ordering a different meal."}
{"text":"Good food. Decent service. The north shore was super crowded so we had to go here since they had lots of open tables. We got nachos which were good but toppings were only on half the nachos. The drafts are poured in 16oz glasses. Also, they advertise for free apps by signing up on a phone app but they're not actually available until 24 hours later. I'd go back but I'd prefer some of the other north shore bars."}
{"text":"The food was okay but salty, and a lot of the items seemed out-of-place in terms of value.  That is, at any number of places a short drive away, one can get a greater variety of food, a greater amount of food, and pay a lower price.  The service was reasonable, but somewhat slow given there were only a few patrons at the time (3:30-4ish pm).  Our group tried to return for dinner, but we were informed there would be a 90 minute wait for *any* food items.  We couldn't wait that long, and moved along elsewhere.  We asked as to why it might be that the wait would be so exceptionally long for any and all food items, and were informed that due to the variability in patronage, it was difficult to provide proper staffing.  I might go back, but it seems like there's plenty of other options nearby that provide a better experience, although the view at Bar Louie can't be beat."}
{"text":"Went in because of the $5 signature burgers.  I enjoyed my burger.  Brittany kept us on our toes, she did very well keeping us informed of our order."}
{"text":"Very slow service and it wasn't even busy. The food was average. Calamari and smothered tots were too salty. My California Chicken Sandwich was decent. Great Mango Margaritas. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great place..food is great service is awesome prices are good specials rock will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had a great time with friends from out of town Great martinis.. Burgers are really good.."}
{"text":"So about 1 year ago, my fianc√© and I had the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant here at Bar Louie. We returned tonight to give this place one more shot... I'm really glad we did because Ned and were AWESOME. A little kindness and hospitality goes a long way, and they turned our entire past experience around. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Been here in the past, I didn't get anything that wasn't good or bad, everything was okay. This time however, though service was spotty as it was the World Series final game day, and we got there late, the food was one of two extremes. I ordered a turkey burger and tater tots, and my co worker ordered chicken nachos.   My turkey burger stank...it's usually the case with ground turkey any ways, I make it at home and it always stinks like sulfur, but with the right amount of spices and flavoring it should eliminate the smell. So not sure what recipe they used but the smell was there, thankfully it wasn't that bad and was edible.   The nachos on the other hand was very good, chicken was cooked well with plenty of chips, cheese and beans on the chips. I actually wished I had ordered the nachos.   The place was crowded which was fun and we whiteness the cubs win. So overall it's a good place to take your load off and eat typical bar food. Will probably come back if I wanted to eat bad food, other than that, will not make an effort just to go eat there for no reason."}
{"text":"$5.46 for a Labatt Blue, an insult to the working man. Louder than necessary.  Generic pictures hung on walls, framed to resemble the anonymous inserts that come packaged in store bought frames as found in Target & Pat Catans.   Is there not a good wholesome bar that is real in Lyndhurst? Is all hope lost? How have I survived 4 years living here? Was tonight an aberration? Have the last 4 years been an illusion? A fake conglomeration of made up events? People so fake, so materialistic, so destined for disappointment that I somehow, someway overlooked it for so long?   Thank you for opening my eyes Bar Louie. It was long needed. So long.   Cheers to the next chapter in this long, fucked up novel I call life."}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday night which seemed like a good night to become because they have $5 burgers (normally 11-12) from 5pm to Close!! The nice thing is that these are gourmet burgers as well such as the bourbon burger which is a burger topped with bacon, onion strings, cheddar cheese and comes with a side of fries or tots! Slamming deal on Tuesdays and I came at 9 and it was still pretty packed. I imagine it would be much busier right around dinner time.   Only miss was how long the burger took. I came with a party of 6 and we didn't get our food for around 40m or so. That being said, you can't beat a gourmet burger with bacon and onion strings for $5-6!! Definitely would drop by again on Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday before the hockey game and gave two hours before it started.. Sat down right away (should've been a clue) took 15 min to get a drink order in then another 10 min or so to get it. At this time we are ready to order and our waiter walks away and doesn't come back for maybe 20-30 minutes.. Put our order in finally and it takes about 45 minutes or so longer to get. At this time by the time we get our food we only have about 15 minutes to scarf it down. Poor customer service - I get that it was probably got busy but at least the waiter could have done was come talk to us about it every once in awhile.   Food was OK but gave all three of us food poisoning. Needless to say will NEVER go back"}
{"text":"Within walking distance to our Hilton hotel, this restaurant/bar is loud and large! They had great HH deals, and I went with their version of a peach bellini that included peach vodka! Woo wee, it was a good one, that I had 2!  Most of us opted for their flat breads (tasty!) and burgers, and I got the fried chicken sandwich with tator tots (how often do you get to eat these at a restaurant?) with a side of mac and cheese which is a must for me!  Service was pretty good for our party of 15, and our food came out quickly enough! My fried chicken sandwich was perfect, that I annhilated the whole thing! Tator tots were the perfect complement to the greasiness of my meal. It was a hit with my peers. Mac and cheese, I didn't care so much for it, although everyone else liked it. It wasn't the creamy cheesiness of mac and cheese that I enjoy.  Prices are really fair here too, and would be back if I was ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Was happy to have a new restaurant to choose from when visiting Westgate but wasn't impressed with Bar Louie. I had such high hopes. The food was average and not of a particularly high grade. Although there are some hit or miss items that would be worth a try. The service is very hit or miss and ranges from slightly friendly to outright rude depending on when you go. Tables may or may not be clean and you may or may not get hot food. Biggest draw here seems to be the bar and the hockey crowd after the games."}
{"text":"Dynamic spot in Tempe Marketplace for decent quality \"bar food\"! If you're a penny-pincher, be mindful of the Happy Hour deadline to score your 1/2 off appetizers, inc Flatbreads, etc.  My date and I did family style HH apps which included:  1. Fried Calamari - he didn't partake and that was fine by me bc it was delicious!! Probably could have backed off of the fried breading a bit, but still GOOD!  2. Buffalo boneless wings - Oh-Em-Gee! Soo good - w/Blue Cheese, dy-no-mite!  3. Bruchetta - very VERY good also. Would have liked to seen our bread a little but harder/toasted but very yummy.  Service was stellar - Kim waited on us and she was a genuinely enthusiastic person. Very attentive and sweet. Great job! She also took our shtick/jokes which I also adored about her."}
{"text":"This place deserves the crap reviews: the bartender, when she finally did show up, didn't know how to make a daiquiri. Her colleague informed me they couldn't make one because they didn't have a blender. Say what?  Continuing the list of unforgivable transgressions were soggy calamari and boneless chicken \"wings\" (note to Bar Louie: wings have bones) that looked and tasted like day-old KFC. The third appetizer we ordered, bruschetta, was edible, but nothing great.  This place gets two stars only for the location and having a nice-ish outdoor bar. Even at happy hour prices, drinks and food were on the pricey side for suburban Cleveland. My friend and I were very glad that we didn't get stuck paying full price or attempt to order a full meal.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been to Bar Louie before but this is my first time leaving them a review. My husband I recently visited Bar Louie for Happy Hour with friends and we had a great experience! We were greeted upon walking into the bar and although it was busy we were able to walk around the high tops and find our friends. The patio has ceiling warmers and there is a table fire pit (there used to be  fireplace but it is now gone). Our friends had already ordered drinks but the server quickly stopped by our table and took our orders. It being Happy Hour we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip with chips and boneless buffalo wings. My husband had a draft beer and I a glass of wine. The food was filling  and I think the norm for Happy Hour appetizers. The crafted drinks look delicious and seem more creative than the appetizers, however on this visit I didn't have a crafted drink so I'm basing my opinion off of prior experiences and what my friend ordered for the night. Service was great as our server kept returning to our table, refilling our water cups, and taking drink orders as necessary. Thanks for a great night!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and a bite to eat on a Friday evening.  They have some great happy hour deals - $3 drafts (with a nice selection) and half off flat bread pizza. I believe there are three or four different types of the flat bread to choose from.    My friend and I sat at the bar and I have to say the service was just ok.  We weren't given plates or silverware with our pizza, the servers didn't seem to know what the other was doing, and it was a bit haphazard.  I ordered a burger medium rare that came out so rare I could have milked the cow.  However, the tatertots served with it were delicious.  Located at the Waterfront across from the movie theater Bar Louie offers both indoor and outdoor seating and is a decent option if you don't want to wait around at the other restaurants (Burgatory is directly across from it!).    This will not be a go to destination for me but it is a decent happy hour choice."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to go with friends and have a few drinks, this isn't the place. After sitting at the bar for 10 minutes, what appears to be a barback finally acknowledged our existence, only to have our drinks wrong and then disappear. No other bartender will even make eye contact with us and I've been trying to cash out for almost an hour. This place is exactly like its next door neighbor Yardhouse minus the quality. Don't waste your time  I'm here again. I still stand by my original post."}
{"text":"Bar Louie is awesome they have friendly servers and great food. Wednesday night $1 beers is the best deal in town!"}
{"text":"I personally enjoyed my recent visit to Bar Louie with a friend but completely understand the poor reviews on help. The restaurant is pricey for what it is, and our waitress was a bit lackluster.  So why does Bar Louie get 3 stars? Happy Hour and a nice patio!  Happy Hour is on Monday-Friday from 4-7pm and offers lots of different options -- $3 Drafts, $4 Wines, $5 Martinis, and 1/2 Price Select Appetizers and Flatbreads. My friend and I ordered 4 Martinis and 3 Appetizers between the 2 of us, and our bill was less than $40 total. Not bad!  I ordered a Strawberry Peach Bellini and a S'Mores Martini, and both were tasty. We shared Bruschetta Pomodoro, Spinach & Artichoke Dip, and Roasted Vegetable Flatbread. The food was also good, and I would order all three items again in the future.  My recommendation is to understand what Bar Louie is good at (Happy Hour) and only frequent the restaurant at those times!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great service location is awesome. Food is very tasty and their Nacho Libre are delicious"}
{"text":"Not bad.. but not great. The service was ok. Not rude or anything just not really friendly kinda seemed to not want to be there. And although I get that. It a your job. Fake it. But with that said. The food is good. I like that you can pick your own seats. Nothing to make me want to go back again and again but still a good place for a little bite and a drink after some shopping. Mac and cheese was really good."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot!!! Fairly priced menu. Better priced happy hour. Delicious martinis on happy hour. And good service. I enjoyed the casual atmosphere with an upscale look. It was a seat your self which my husband and I appreciated. Our server came over promptly and when we told him it was our first time there he was able to make suggestions. We went for happy hour and were not disappointed. They had 5.25 martinis that were amazing! Between both of us we had four and the double melon and s'mores martinis are must haves! We got their verde chicken flat bread ($5 on happy hour) and chicken and shrimp jerk lettuce wraps. Both were delicious but if u can't handle spice I suggest a different wrap. I can't wait to go back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"We come here all the time for the Burger Tuesday deal ($5 Burgers 5-close, what?). Unbeatable for the value and quality. We usually throw in an app and a few drinks and end up with a good tip for four people 50 bones down, which isn't bad at all. Highly recommend this place.  The calamari was superb and surprising for a bar chain to have such good taste and quality on that app."}
{"text":"This is my 4th or 5th time here and I got to say I love it. Indoor/outdoors seating, huge bar, polite staff and a lot of the female staff are hot depending on the night or number of drinks, whichever comes first lol. Also have a good menu for bar food so you can fill your appetite as well as have a nice drink and people watch if your outside. The inside has several pieces of eye candy besides the waitresses so guys don't bring sand to the beach if you plan on fishing if you know what I mean. I can't give this place 5 star then I be putting it in the category of a place you have to wear a dinner jacket. As a matter of fact I am just rating dives/bars definitely a 5star, hold on changing rating. Well til next time visit Bar Louie if you in the Tempe area.."}
{"text":"Servers very attentive we had party of 7 and Seri did well.  The lemon drop martini is the best 5.25 @ happy hour but they don't fill the glass come on fill it up! Food good: blacken salmon sliders are great as is Chic Alfredo. Can't wait to go back!  The hostess that was there last Fri at 5pm was useless and had little interest in doing her job."}
{"text":"For the best time, happy hour, staff (Manager Jonathan, servers Kayla & Taylor) great food (Nachos!!!!) pet friendly!  We stopped for a bite and a beer and ended up staying in Glendale for a few days and visiting Bar Louie several times...everything was great!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks are ok. It's great that the happy hour goes to 7 but the service is horrible. I've been here 3-4 times recently and each time our waiter has taken 25-30 mins to get us the check or 15 mins to check in and see if we want a refill. This isn't on a Friday or Saturday but rather Wednesday and Thursdays. If you want a good deal that's fine but is it worth doubling how long it should take to go out for a few drinks?"}
{"text":"I would of have a zero but wasn't available we got there at 615 did not leave till ten till 8 still half of us did not have our food drinks took 10 min every time ...asked for a manager because we just wanted our checks to leave because we had to get to a concert ... 25 min later .... offered us shots did not even offer to compensate the people who were taking there food to go we were Sat the same time as two tables beside us we watched them get apps then dinner then box there's up sit and we still had nothing ... completely unacceptable  to be in a restraunt for almost 2 hours and not have food"}
{"text":"The berry mojito is perfect, the fig and pig flatbread is epic, and it's a short hop over to the movie theater. I mean, it's no Dave and Buster's (it doesn't smell like teenage feet at ALL) but it'll do in a pinch."}
{"text":"Bar Louie has the best happy hour and the most consistent service. Angelina is a doll and I highly recommend you get in her section.  Another lovely server (name unknown) turned me onto the boneless buffalo wings (half Szechuan half Buffalo) and they are AMAZING!   *we attempt to sample every martini every time and they are all worth tasting.   Bar Louie is a great Friday HH spot!!!"}
{"text":"Berry mojitos are fantastic. Calamari was good. Staff were busy but always cake when called. My only issue was the mess that was left in front of me the entire time we sat at the bar. Otherwise it was a good experience. Good prices. Good food."}
{"text":"Food is good but service sucks here. Really really sucks they were not even busy and our waitress was horrible. I don't complain when places are busy but this place was so slow. Will not be back don't recommend."}
{"text":"Had a range of meals for lunch.  Service was good.  Food so so. Even simple salads were disappointing.  Wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the cavs game with my friends and was so pleased with the fast and easy service. Our server Angela was so sweet and bubbly and our food came out so quickly! The smores martini is TO DIE FOR. I will be coming back again soon."}
{"text":"A disappointing meal!  The California chicken was burnt and had a very smoky flavor!  The mussels were dry and flavorless-The salt masked the taste.  Usually you look forward to dipping the toasted bread into the mussel broth but something was weird with the soft bread and broth combination.  I thought I was being too critical so I tried the trick on the wife.  I broke a piece of the bread and dipped it into the mussel broth then gave it to her to eat.  After a second, she saw me laughing and said \"You jerk!\" Cause she realized I let her try something that wasn't good!  We ordered artichoke dip as an appetizer...not sure what to say about it except for it tasted like a cheap microwave brand - it was awful.  The only reason I didn't give it 1 star was because our waitress was nice and prompt.  The Christmas Ale with the cinnamon sugar rim was delicious.  So, in the end, go someplace else for a good meal unless you are there to drink and then need some food to absorb the alcohol."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Wednesday afternoon. Nobody there and I mean nobody else. Nice selection of draft beers. I had a few of these OMB Coppers which are local I understand. One of the best amber pale ales I've had. Except they were $7.10 each. Ouch on a stick. While there I munched on the appetizer of tater tots cover in cheese, scallions, bacon and a hot pepper mix. Super good. Seemed like a good place to drink beer. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"It's HOT IN HERE..NOOOOO AIR!!! The air conditioning is off or not working...FIRST time to Cleveland. LAST TIME to Bar Louie.  Gonna have a great time sightseeing tomorrow. Cavaliers country and can wait to get my Jersey tomorrow.. Cool breeze during the day, with a nice 84 degrees.."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the other reviews on here, but we had a pretty great experience at Bar Louie's North Shore location.  We went before a pirate game, it wasn't too crowded and we were seated and greeted almost right away.  Great happy hour specials and the food was mostly delicious too.  Only complaint I have is the guacamole (part of the trio dips appetizer), it was pretty much just mashed up avocado, no seasoning or onion or anything in it.  We came on $5 burger night as well, turkey burger is delicious!  Highly recommend it here, just don't go for the guac."}
{"text":"If I could give less than a 1 star I would!!!  I travel for a living....literally it was the worse service (first and foremost ) and food I have had in a very long time.  Horrible really just doesn't even cut it!!!!!  I can get better service and food from McDonald's!"}
{"text":"Bar Louie is my favorite Happy Hour Bar. They have the best martinis and the friendliest staff. Michelle is my personal favorite she is always friendly, fast, and helpful. This place is a must at Westgate Glendale."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour, 4-7pm, pretty good drink specials and some food specials, but not too many. The happy hour food special were limited to non-filling items, and we HAD to try the sliders. But it's \"happy hour\", so who cares. The beer was cold and served in skinny maybe-a-pint glasses. But they were $4 or less for beers. The place is nice, the clientele were mainly very well-dressed professional over-25s. D√©cor and lighting were nice, high ceilings and lots of seat yourself seating. They really should continuously shout \"seat yourself\", because I did not see any sign on our way in as people were milling about. The patio is great when it's cool out, great people watching possibilities.   Food. Well, try to get your bartenders attention a lot before you order. Our cohort had to send her sliders back because they were undercooked, and not by a little. We tried the short rib sliders which were fine. The hot wings were okay, but the blue cheese dressing tasted like bacon ranch from the supermarket. The bartenders are very distracted by each other. It was like watching \"The Dating Game\" with your empty glass pushed up to the edge, begging for notice but getting none.   I doubt I will go back unless someone makes me. Which unfortunately they may, as it is right next to the movie theater. If so, I will tell you all about it and try some new strategies to get the bartenders attention."}
{"text":"Tasty drinks but pretty slow service. Upon walking in I was ignored by servers and bartenders for atleast 5min. The drinks are tasty but the pricing is definitely off! I won't be back."}
{"text":"Terrible service. My friend and I went for happy hour before a concert and one of the waiters told us to pick any table outside.  When we went outside, all of the tables were busy and the ones that were open still had dirty dishes on it from the previous customers.  It took us about 20 minutes to get a busboy to clear the table, and then an additional 40 minutes to place our orders and receive the beers we ordered as soon as we walked into the restaurant.  Overall, it took us 2.5 hours to get our food (which was cold by the time it was served to us) and drinks."}
{"text":"Food was pretty bad.  It was extremely over priced and frankly tasted like it came out of a plastic bag.  We got the Fish n Chips and Cheese Steak.  Service was ok."}
{"text":"This bar is a bit pricey for my taste but they do have a good happy hour! $5.25  martinis and half off appetizers aren't bad at all. :-)   The service staff is pretty good and prompt most of the time. I have come 3 times before and the waitress has been nice and quick. I like coming here to catch up with friends who live in the area. If you're going to get a martini, stick with the champagne martini. It's worth what you pay for."}
{"text":"Just an absolute awful experience a few nights ago. To be clear, I typically enjoy Bar Louie locations pretty much wherever they are. Friday night was not one of those nights. It surprised me that the bar and restaurant were not crowded when we got there, but now I know why. Service was poor, attitudes were negative, and it took forever to get anything. Everyone working there looked grumpy or had very cynical or sarcastic comments to make. Didn't look like anyone working enjoyed spending any part of their lives there and they wanted to pass it on to their guests.   Since we had already eaten across the street we had just stopped in for some drinks and dessert before heading back to the hotel. Mistake. We perused the dessert menu and one member of our group decided to get the chocolate cake. Then the waiting began. After 5-10 minutes we talked to the bartender about their desserts and asked about how they made them or whether they were made in-house, etc. His response? \"It takes too long and costs too much to make. Nobody buys that crap.\" WOW... Nice job building value in your company, your product, and your guests' confidence in their decision. While I do appreciate the honesty of telling us they don't actually make the cake, they could probably form their response with a little more tact.   The waiting continues. After about 20-25 minutes of waiting on the cake we are ready to scrap the order altogether, especially since we were waiting a ridiculous amount of time for a pre-made purchased cake that they just needed to slap on a plate. When we decided to pay up and leave we got nothing but grief from the staff about not wanting the cake anymore. What a miserable place to be - whether working there or dining there."}
{"text":"First time at this location.  Came before the Roger waters concert so the place was crazy busy.  Had great service at happy hr prices at the bar. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after a sightseeing cruise around Pittsburgh and it was perfect! It wasn't anything super fancy but just what we were looking for. It seemed that everyone had come in this direction to eat after the cruise so it got busy and the kitchen got backed up but the waiter was super nice and the manager came over to check in and talk to us multiple times to see if we needed anything. The atmosphere was also very nice it wasn't too loud but also wasn't too dull and there is a very nice view of the river. Definitely would recommend as a casual place to grab a bite to eat, my boyfriend and I split two apps and that filled us up and both were super good. We got wings and the bruschetta with shrimp which was delicious and a perfect appetizer!"}
{"text":"Long story short, I only like coming here to drink.  Short story long, well, when people talk, drink and sit there for at least 2 hours, they get hungry, so they want to eat. I've been to this location several times, mostly to drink and once on Tuesday $1 burger night. Like I said, I prefer to come here only to drink but when I do eat, their food is what gives this place the 3-Star rating, it's OK.  I've had other items that I've tried on the menu but they were so 'awesome' that my brain totally blocked it from my memory-- yes, sarcasm. $1 burger night, it's $1 for the bun, top and bottom and the patty. You're able to choose what you'd like on the burger, little did I know that they charge for all the rest of the stuff. I forgot how much they charge per item but I added onions, tomatoes & guacamole, it was beyond $1 at that point. Alright here it is, the burger was-- BLAH. I didn't care for it. The patty was dry, seemed like they cooked it and put it in the warmer for a LONG time. The bread fell apart, as if it were old, dry bread. I liked the fillers than I did the rest of the burger- the part that mattered!  At least I'll always have my beer, mmm, beer."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it is spacious, nicely decorated, and very close to where I work. However after walking out of here twice due to horrible service I think I have given Bar Louie a shot and will never come back. You would have to pay me to come back here. The first time I came here around 10pm on a Friday night and walked out after I waited 20 minutes for service and didn't get any. Then I came again to check out their $5 burger special on Tuesday. I figured I would give them a second chance. I came at 5:10 on a Tuesday figuring I could stay until 6:30 because then I would have to leave for an appointment. We had our burger order in by 5:20 and waited and waited. By 5:50 I was getting very worried and asked the waitress when our burgers were coming and she said soon. Waitress was not friendly and had no personality but hey $5 burgers so we overlooked it. By 6:20 our burgers had yet to come out and I had to leave. I had to get the check for the drink I ordered, pay for the drink, and walk out starving. Thanks Bar Louie for leaving me starving! Please for the love of decent service do not go here. Take it from me I gave them two chances. Will never return."}
{"text":"Very slow service night of Patriots vs Cardinals game and bar was not packed by any means. Boneless wing apps came out cold. Blue cheese burger was good though. Overall will not repeat."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Service was a little disappointing and kind of slow. One of our 5 lunches was delayed, the salad and it was a 2 at best. I am sure there are a lot is other restaurants that are better than this one."}
{"text":"Favorite bar tenders are Kristina and Kailee. Sit where you want when you walk in. The bar is where I'm always at also you can smoke in the patio area."}
{"text":"Awesome sauce type of place! Best happy hour on the north shore (Mon to Fri 5 to 7) 3.50 -14 oz draft, 4.50- glasses of wine, 5.50- signature martinis, and half off selected apps! Doesn't matter if your young or old, the atmosphere is welcoming of all types of ppl and a comfortable place to hang! The servers are down to earth friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Just had a quick bite to eat with drinks. Shared nachos & they were really good. Service was decent. We were close to computer soo I'm sure that was one thing that made our service a little faster than others. ;)"}
{"text":"Typical pub food. Lots of salt on the fries etc, to make you thirsty. Minimal service on a slow Monday night.,although server was efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"SO many delicious options. The loaded tater tots and the pretzel sticks are great appetizers. I got the seared tuna sandwich and they gave it to me without the avocado but with the avocado is necessary, make sure they don't forget it and that you ask for it cooked until still pink  because the second time I got the sandwich it was totally cooked, not just seared. Both times I've gone I haven't had the best service and the waitresses were so crabby, they rushed us to choose food. The grub is good and filling however the service is low par."}
{"text":"Slowest service I've ever had for a place that was only half full.  Sat outside for over 10 minutes no one ever came to get our drinks,  so we walked inside and sat at the bar because you figured that would be the fastest way to get service. WRONG the bartenders were awful.  I saw about 4 of them but it still took forever to get drinks.  I had to flag down one of them just to order.  Got the chips and dip. Queso was bomb,  salsa ok,  but the guac was terrible!! No one ever checked on us to see how it was even though 2 bartenders were talking to eachother right in front of us. At this point i was over the appetizer. Again had to flag down a bartender because no one checked on us. I asked for the salmon sliders because that was the only reason i went there in the first place and shocker they were all out of salmon. I said screw it after that and got the check.  Glad i had a free app coupon because lord knows how long it would have taken a manger to talk to me last night. ( side note: i only had a free app coupon because they forgot to ring in my lunch when i was on break the last visit and i didn't have time to stay and wait for them to get a cup of soup that i had already waited 25 minutes for) After being a server for over 10 years i am extremely disappointed in the service.  The bartenders were only worried about socializing with eachother and service is non existent."}
{"text":"Since the location at Station Square shut down, we haven't been able to find one to visit until we were in the North Shore area last weekend. I didn't know about this location and was excited to go. Our service was good but it took a little longer to get our drinks but that was okay since that's all we ordered. The wait staff was very nice and the restaurant was very clean. It was busier than I would have preferred but that's what you get on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"We arrived here and the sign told us to seat ourselves. As we were looking for a place to sit everything seemed dirty. We decided on an open booth as that is what my parents wanted. The seat of the booth was all ripped up. I don't know why this place wouldn't invest in replacing these when it looks so trashy. The table was not clean and the menus were all sticky. I was never super comfortable here just because it was so dirty. It took probably 15 minutes for a waitress to come introduce herself and get us drinks. After we ordered our food it took at least half an hour to receive it. We were five minutes away from walking out. I will however, say that the food was very good.  I'm assuming they may have been short staffed, which they did the best they could. I don't feel the filthiness of the place was excusable though."}
{"text":"We had a large party for a birthday and our server Missy was great as well as the food, drinks, and bartenders! Thanks for making our event a great one!"}
{"text":"Pop corn here is amazing and it goes with the drinks, but do not try cocktails here. I ordered a Mojito it wasn't good. Food is average."}
{"text":"Visited on a Thursday night for a date, and it was pretty slow. I ordered a Havana Mojito - this drink was featured on their menu, and it was horrible. It tasted like pure lime juice with a little sugar water thrown in - no taste of alcohol whatsoever. Later in the evening, when the bill came, I discovered that I was charged $10 for it. I have never before been charged $10 for a mixed drink - that is highway robbery. For dinner I had the \"Drunken Fish & Chips\" - another complete waste of money. Three little strips of fish, along with a handful of fries. The cost of this was $13. It tasted okay, but certainly not $13 worth of food. The food arrived fairly quick, but the waitress seemed rather aloof - like she could care less about waiting on customers. The atmosphere was nice, and the food was okay (but skimpy on portion size). However, the prices were astronomical and the service was ho-hum at best."}
{"text":"ive been wanting to come here for awhile because its from Chicago. Came her with my wife and we had happy hour.. You walk in and find your seat, no greeters. Its it crazy loud , waiter couldnt hear us. We ordered a few thinks from the happy hour menu and a few drinks. I ordered the en fuego wings and they are not en fuego so if you like spicy you will be disappointed. The martini was watery. The pretzel things are good, nice and soft inside. would like to go back and try the chicago burger."}
{"text":"The place where my fianc√© and I first met. Went back for anniversary, mentioned it to server, and were given a free dessert to help us celebrate. Very, very cool Bar Louie! Love ya even more now!   Jerk shrimp lettuce wraps are so spicy hot they blew us away - extremely spicy - very good but caused us to order plain old soft pretzel to balance out the heat.  Buffalo chicken flat bread - great but hot too"}
{"text":"So I ended up here on a Tuesday afternoon with a buddy around 4:00 and it just so happened to be $1 burger day which really turned into $4-5 burger day but I guess it still wasn't a bad deal.  Basically almost anything you add to your burger is an up charge so to get lettuce, tomato, onion you will be paying more than a buck. Just be aware of that. It makes sense but some of the up charges are pretty silly in my opinion.  As far as the burger goes, they didn't ask me how I wanted them done. I'd prefer medium but got well done.  Good thing I paid an extra dollar for that Romulade sauce to add some flavor!!!  As others have noted, the service was slower than normal. We even say at the bar and had to wait several minutes for drinks. Pouring a beer doesn't take that long and an old fashion is a pretty common drink. I'd think both could be done in less than five minutes. And I found it very strange that we had no less than 3 people waiting on us. I wasn't sure who to ask for what. It was slightly confusing.  Everyone was really nice though and the place was pretty clean with no wait. I just think they could make some improvements to make the experience a bit better.  Speed it up, have some consistency with wait staff and please start asking how you'd like your burger cooked."}
{"text":"Given that it's a chain restaurant, it's a pretty good option.  Definitely can't beat the location and the atmosphere is great as well.  My food was good but not inspired (which is what I expect from a chain restaurant).  I did appreciate the effort to offer more healthy options with the lettuce wraps.    Service was great, even though they were quite busy."}
{"text":"Went for lunch before the Shawn Mendes concert, ordered buffalo wings, a cheese quesadilla and bacon cheeseburger sliders to share for our group of three. It's was plenty of food and the quality was great. The server was fast and efficient, no complaints."}
{"text":"Meh. Meh meh meh meh meh.   Not great. Not terrible. Everything too salty. Sangria mixed with amaretto enticed me. But it ended up tasting like sangria, with amaretto in it. Do you know what I mean? Like when someone says \"try Rehab's peanut butter and jelly burger!\" And you're like, man, I wonder if the mixture of salty and sweet results in a fantastic new taste combination?? And then you have it, and it literally just tastes like a burger, which someone has put peanut butter and jelly on."}
{"text":"Flies, gnats, uninspired food and service.  Missed opportunities.  People seemed good, but poorly led I suspect.  Nice options on cocktails and well crafted.  Likely would not return."}
{"text":"I've given this place several chances before giving up completely. We always sit at the bar, and the bartenders literally ignore us. There's no way you don't see me and my guests sitting, without drinks. And it's never super busy when we have gone in! Your bartenders need to learn to at least acknowledge - a very basic customer service trait. When you finally do revive a drink, it sits empty forever! I spent years tending bar and would never treat guests this way.   Ps - had a group of 8 girlfriends wanting to go tonight and I warned them not to because your service is horrendous. They went to Cheesecake instead."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in on Monday 6-11-18 for a few drinks. It was a very special occasion as I only get to see her every few years because she lives in England.  This was also my first visit to this restaurant. I have to say this place was nothing to brag about. Nothing about my visit would make me want to return. Well I take that back our drink \"The Diva\" was delicious. The spinach dip tasted like it came from a box. The atmosphere was very cold. The first server seemed to have a personality and was o.k. But after she left the remaining team members stood around staring at us. It was weird. Really wishing we would have went to Houlihan's instead."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has so many bad reviews, I've been here a few times and it's always been good. Yes, sometimes the service can be so-so but they have a good happy hour and the food is yummy. Last time I came here I had the Ahi tuna burger and it was soooo delicious. Very fresh and filling.   On Sundays they do pitchers of sangria for $10 but don't get too excited because they are served in a small pitcher which pours about 3 cups. It is still good but I wonder, do they just use the old wine left over from the week? EEK.   Overall, It's a fun atmosphere with many great drinks to choose from. They have a lot of great beers on tap. My favorite being the dogfish IPA. Our waitress was pretty slow and messed up our bill but other than that it was a good experience. Definitely not 5 stars but I'd say giving them 4 is generous."}
{"text":"First time here and most likely the last.  Great atmosphere, clean, mixed crowd all great. Great drinks and the good was excellent. Customer service, however.... Not so much.  No greet at door though there were several staff around. First time so didn't know if u sat yourself or what. Finally asked, found a spot outside and was good. 15 mins later, still no waiter. Now mind you it was not packed AT ALL. Had to go get waiter, server smelled, brought no eating utensils, had to find the waiter to get our check.   I pay good money for good service. The service here is not worth the fact that the food was good. I will try elsewhere."}
{"text":"nice interior  very big bar with reasonable prices. good for big companies, a lot of TV'S"}
{"text":"This place is atrocious. I never write reviews but this one needs it. We got there at 2pm and waited until 3:45 to get a sandwich.  Then when we get the sandwich the chicken is raw.  So she replaced it but the other sandwich never made it to the table. After a half hour we decided to leave. This place sucks and I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"First time in, was later on at night and actually was told to come here by a restaurant that was closing when we showed up. Had David as are server, dude was only one waiting tables and still did his best, girlfriend got 2 girl drinks with pulled pork sandwhich which was good, my burger and fries were good as well. Better for non family type place, was only a tad more than a chain. Will go again"}
{"text":"I pretty much agree with everything that has been said about Bar Louie - poor service...poorer food quality...overpriced drinks...but at happy hour, I can get down with Bar Louie.  What's not to love about a $5 martini...even if it takes you ages to flag down someone to get you one.  Select apps are also half off during happy hour.  I can't say that I can rave about any of them, but I'd rather pay half price for mediocre food than full price.  My advice?  Stick to the booze and only go during happy hour...then your wallet and your belly will leave happy."}
{"text":"I have frequented Bar Louie (1-2 times/wk) since September of 2016 to present, but I am noticing a decline in service as of late.  Their \"self-seating\" policy is really not working in their favor because their servers are assigned to specific sections.  After waiting at a booth for twenty minutes without being greeted, I relocated myself outside and waited another ten without being greeted.  This was the final straw for me at Bar Louie.  Although their happy hour & tuesday burger special are good deals, I can't stand poor service.  My recommendation to Bar Louie management is to either replace your self-seating policy, or train your staff better so that people aren't waiting forever to be greeted."}
{"text":"Unorganized staff. No smiles on any waitress . Drinks are way overpriced . HH prices are good, only if they put booze in the drinks. Won't be back"}
{"text":"If you're gonna serve street tacos, please make sure they aren't torn or even worse torn and torn off... the meat was not shredded completely like they broke off a chunk of shredded meat and heat it up. The only positive from my first experience was the bacon in the bloody mary. Was too hot for my liking but still drank it. The food presentation was most disappointing. I'm Mexican I should have known better than to order street tacos is its not a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. I have avoided this location for so long. I gave it a shot tonight because of a work get together. Our servers name was Sarah and she was great! She was attentive and on her game. I had the 'Diva' martini, which was very sweet and fruity. The bruschetta was good as well (however not traditional), served with a mix of tomato, onion, lettuce. The soft  pretzel sticks were your typical pretzel stick, however good, and served with three dipping sauces, honey mustard, a cheese dip, and a brown sugar/butter dip. The chips and salsa were served with three salsas, guac, regular salsa with a kick, and the cheese dip. The bar is clean. The food is trustworthy and not half bad, it is noisy, but that's is to be expected. It is a great place to watch a game, hang with friends and let go of work. The location is prime as well. Overall, a very pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"What an experience! Simply went for a girls night out and it ended up turning into an awesome dining and bar experience. The server we had was named AJ. He was very friendly and didn't mind taking the time to explain the dishes on the menu, what he thought was best (including the drinks). He was very attentive and made sure our drinks were filled.  We started with an app of the tempura shrimp. The shrimp were fried and served with three different sauces of all tasteing pallets. The entree i had, was a surprise chosen by AJ, the Blackened salmon sliders. There were three sliders served with thick cuts of salmon and a side of fries. The sliders had a pesto mayo on them that added to the great flavor.  The atmosphere is friendly. The time we came, on a Saturday around 5pm, was not busy and allowed the service to be extra! The prices of drinks is a little much, but the service and food out way that. Thank you for a awesome girls night! Means a lot!"}
{"text":"Expensive drinks (we paid close to $10 for one craft beer and a regular Coke), can't really say anything about the food as the menu didn't look appetizing enough for us to stay and we went elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food was okay. The noise level--with 10 people in a huge room--deafening. Awful acoustics!"}
{"text":"Great martini's. Nice location. Quiet enough to actually hold a conversation. Or, at least was during the time of day I was there."}
{"text":"Came here for a happy hour/bday of a classmate. It was a good time. Lot's of tasty apps and plenty of cocktails and beer on tap for those who drink. I enjoy the location as there are things to do in Tempe Marketplace after eating.   Didn't try the full menu but did have quite a few apps. I really enjoyed the garlic lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"Our waitress was awesome!!!! Very helpful and super sweet!! Cindy is awesome!! First time here and we will definitely be back!!! Great hospitality and I come from Hawaii where everywhere you go people are really kind and easy to talk to and hard to find kindness we would like to Thank Cindy we will be back for making our visit fun and enjoyable!! With 3 kids we look for a good,clean and enjoyable friendly service!!"}
{"text":"Listen, I can understand the hatred. It's a chain bar in a yuppie mall that's filled with chain stores and chain restaurants. But I must dissent, if only for one reason...   HAPPY HOUR!   They serve $5 Chopin dirty martinis for happy hour. (There's a bunch of other martini and beer specials, but this is the only one I get excited about.) They also have half priced appetizers during happy hour, but I've yet to eat anything here that I was actually impressed with. I don't even really recommend their $5 burger special on Mondays. But, you can have a decently priced snack while you sip on your incredible bargain martini and watch all the yuppies.  I'd hit it. (Actually, I did, and I will again.)"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Service is a hit or miss depending on the day you go. It's nice to see a restaurant that has happy hour until 7pm so you can actually enjoy it after work. Great martinis and wine and we love the burger deals."}
{"text":"Can't judge the food but we popped in the other night and had a couple martinis at the bar.  They were delicious!!  They have a fun martini menu and their happy hour prices are great.  It was super packed due to a concert night but I look forward to returning on a night when it's not as busy and trying some food."}
{"text":"I tried Bar Louie for lunch today for the first time. Unfortunately I won't go back. The service was very poor. I had to go to the bar for condiments and silverware because the waitress never came back. The plate had hair on it so I took up to bartender and stated, \"could i have a clean plate this one has hair on it\" instead of good customer service saying I apologize let me get you a clean plate she grabs the plate without a word like I had just inconvenienced her.  Mind you there was maybe 10 people in the entire bar at lunch time so it wasn't because it was busy. The food was flavorless.  I don't have a positive to report about the place unfortunately."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst meals I've ever had. I got the bacon cheeseburger sliders and a side of Mac n cheese. The sliders were cold and the onion straws were greasy. The mac n cheese was the only good thing. The Moscow mule I received was basically all lime juice. So unhappy as I had a great experience at another location. Will not return"}
{"text":"Service was cool. Alcohol drinks suck. I got an orange mule and my wife got a Mai Tai. We don't drink much and we could not taste any alcohol. My wife didn't even get a buzz from her Mai Tai and those always do her in. Food and service was good. Cool atmosphere. Drinks just killed it especially for the price."}
{"text":"Big thumbs down to the \"Event Menu\". The bar was almost empty with maybe 12 people total. The Event Menu should be reserved for after the game for the people attending The Event. 2 cups of coffee at $6.49 sent us right out the door to Yardhouse where the menu and the prices never change. Also, big props to Yardhouse for being more accommodating."}
{"text":"If you like sub par service and okay food, then this is your place. Our bartender wouldn't check on us, and our drinks were empty for a little. When we wanted shots, we had to flag one of them down. Now mind you, it wasn't very busy. I got the pear and blue cheese salad, it was good but needed way more dressing. I will say the atmosphere is pretty good. Maybe they were having an off day, but I'd still go back and give this place another shot"}
{"text":"Despite the fire alarm going off for ten minutes it was a good time. Solid comfort food. I got a Mac and cheese sandwich which was pretty solid. Not a must try but not too shabby either"}
{"text":"Service and food were great!  Brooke is the best!  She can cure hiccups... Goes above an beyond!!!"}
{"text":"This place is more of a local hangout, not too many out of towners are going to find themselves having a beer at this cool little joint. I personally think that is a shame.  This place is awesome. You can grab a beer after work or spend your whole evening here.  They have happy hour and the food is yummy!  The waitress and bartenders are hot.  There is an outside bar as well.   What more do you need in Vegas?"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but make sure you have a couple hours to spend there. lets just say their staff needs a fire lit under their booties! Also i odered a virgin bloody mary and was charged $10. Thats how much my meal was. Oh. And they charged me a liquor tax. The manger said thats just how it is. Lets just say ill never be going back. Hope they last longer then Darcee's!"}
{"text":"I love Bar Louie HH.  Cheap martinis!  I always get a 90 Miles to Florida, it's like candy in a glass.  I also consistently order the boneless wings, but Bae has discovered the $5 burgers on Tuesday and keeps saying he wants to go back.  The best part is that HH goes to 7p, while most other places end at 6p.  This is my go-to when it comes to after works drinks."}
{"text":"Great food.  Amazing decor.  Friendly bar staff. Management are very attentive.  What else can I say. The food?  Yeah I loved it.  I ordered the Voodoo Pasta.  It was amazing.  It had a spicy flare to it that I love. You will not be disappointed if you order this entree. I'll be back and looking forward to trying something else."}
{"text":"Came in before my movie for happy hour. Corita did an outstanding job taking care of us."}
{"text":"Nice space with a great river view.  The bartender didn't know how to make a grasshopper though.  Eh, I was just in the mood for something green and minty, what can you say.  Background music was a little loud for the amount of people in there, but at least it wasn't 80's music."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My friends and I are always so impressed with the service. The food is excellent . Everyone is very attentive and accommodating. If you haven't been here your missing out. Alyssa, Ned and Mckenzie are reason enough."}
{"text":"Don't make the mistake of going here!  I've had good experiences at other bar louie locations but this one is a joke. We went there early afternoon on a Monday when the place mostly empty. The waitresses were just sitting in the back talking and not really be productive at all. We ordered our drinks and the bartender walked them over to us - not our own waitress. We waited 15 minutes for her to show up to order our food but finally gave up we had someone else go find her and we pay for our overly expensive $10 cocktails and left to Burgatory which had way cheaper drinks and better food.  Don't make the the mistake of going here! Go to Burgatory, rivertowne or even, heck, Tilted Kilt if you don't mind half naked ladies taking your order. All three competitors have better service, good food and way better prices."}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere and very decent prices but bar service on a non-busy night was very suspect, Manhattan was not good enough to finish, and flatbed pizza was mediocre.  Go for basic drinks, but nothing fancy and don't expect much more than bar-quality food."}
{"text":"I only go here when I can't get into Burgatory and because I enjoy the outdoor area with the firepit which is a pretty cool atmosphere.  Their really unhealthy food options like the loaded fries or loaded tots are pretty good, but their healthier food options are really lacking.  I tried to get the blackened fish tacos and the fish was really dry and overcooked and of poor quality.  The tortillas were completely stale and hard and had large gashes down the middle.  They have a decent beer selection but when I asked what their seasonal Great Lakes on tap was they said the Christmas ale (it's the last week in April now). I knew that if I ordered that draft it would be quite stale as it's probably been in there for 6 months now, so I got a Southern Tier instead which was good.  The service is ok but rather slow.  Overall I'm pretty underwhelmed by this place."}
{"text":"I came here for a work meeting meeting. The food was great but service was a bit slow and the food took forever. The atmosphere was nice, had a nice patio and bar area. The drunken fish sandwich I had was colossal! Very yummy and my lunch companions had the voodoo chicken plate that they said was the best! I will be back to try that chicken plate!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat and I just experienced the worst service ever in this place.   Ericka (Bo$$ Bitch hand tattoo) was nasty, rude, and unconcerned. We barely made it past waters and placing orders (which took 20 min). I confronted her about how she was treating us. She could care less, so we left immediately. Tremendous disappointment."}
{"text":"Had a really great experience here over the weekend.  A group of about 8 of us came for Happy Hour. Our server (sorry I forget her name!) was super nice and let us keep adding to our table and helped getting us more chairs.  Happy hour was half price most of the appetizers. Also drafts were only 3.75 which is amazing for an IPA beer.  I ended up ordering something that was not even on the menu, and the server did not bat a lash. It came out just how I wanted.  It is not often you can have multiple drinks, and a full meal for $20. I will be sure to frequent here more often for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I found this place this evening while searching for the Monongahela Incline. It's located across from Station Square. College Football was playing, so it was really loud in there.  It was a good thing the place is large and spacious. It was a beautiful day, so they had all the big doors open. The patio had a fabulous view of the city, but I chose to sit inside 'cause I wanted to see the game.  The food here is really good and I had a great service. I was  served very quickly after sitting down. It wasn't very busy, but the people who were there seemed to be enjoying themselves.  I had the Blackened Fish Po'Boy and two glasses of their signature lemonade. (I ordered the Raspberry and Pomegranate) Both were sweet and delicious.   The Fish Po'Boy was huge! It was definitely an oversized sandwich. It had chipolte mayo, lettuce and tomatoes and came with a side of olive mix and french fries. It was really scrumptious.   I scarfed down every morsel. Yum.....   They have free Wi-Fi, but spotty.   4 stars fabulousness."}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say. Our waitress was nice , but right when we got there we told her we were pressed for time and had to be somewhere . She assured us food would be there soon. Not!!! Took forever and we felt so bad because she said the manager and cooks yelled at her when she told them that we needed the food sooner than later because of that boat tour we were taking was taking off soon for tickets we already purchased . Awkward . Would not go back to a place where a manager treats his employees so poorly"}
{"text":"I Stopped in for happy hour today with a few friends. I really liked the  contemporary decor,  we sat at a comfortable booth and the bar stools looked cushy and had backs which is always a plus.  The lighting was just right. The corner area inside had  small couches and chairs for a more intimate laid back experience.  Outside patio  had  a few low patio couches and chairs as well as  tall bar tables and chairs in a shaded area. Very tasteful appearance overall. Our server was very knowledgeable of the food and drink selection. She was really personable and truly smiled..  Good selection of Happy Hour  half price small plates and $5 Martinis!  I chose The Diva ~Skyy Pineapple,PAMMA Liqueur, Pomegranate syrup, Pineapple juice complete with a pineapple wedge garnish. It was very tasty.  My friend decided on the Effen Good. Appropriately named too! Effen Cucumber,mint, fresh lime juice,Agave nectar and fresh sliced cucumbers. It was refreshingly awesome. I plan to order that  next time :) The virgin Mango Limeade was nice as well. We ordered the Drunken Fish and Chips and amazingly, it was as good as our favorite Irish Pub fish we usually hit up on Fridays for  Fish n Chips.Perfectly crisp batter and not greasy.  I ordered standard bar food , Boneless buffalo chicken wings .  Crispy  with lots of meaty chicken , good heat and tangy just the way I like it. The last item  was the Chicken Gumbo and that too was delicious. We definitely plan to go back. I saw Wednesdays is $1 domestic Drafts so that may be another group outing.  The bill for 3 of us came to $41~ cant beat that! We will be back again Louie!"}
{"text":"The $5 burgers are great BUT THE WORST SERVICE EVER!!! We live close so we endure the horrible service for the deal...seriously get ready for   At least an hour wait no drink refills and grumpy service! Not once twice but always!"}
{"text":"Bar Louie is the type of place that I go to so often, but not really because I'm in love with the place. It's just a generally pleasing option for everybody when planning a Thursday night hangout session. I've had many different appetizers here, but don't have much to say other than they were edible. The mixed drinks are acceptable, but if I were you I'd opt to order from the beer list. Just because that way, you know you'll be getting your alcohol. Sometimes their drinks are weaksauce, especially during happy hour. Overall? Don't expect much, and bring good company if you're coming here."}
{"text":"Let me just say that this used to be a place I loved.  Remember when you'd go somewhere and have good food, great service and a general pleasant experience and then a few months you'd go back and have it all again? Well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you can't describe and the place is no longer familiar. To me, that is Bar Louie  I can't say the food is bad. I had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzels were stale. I will say I still ate them so shame on me. My  sandwich (the Mario) as always was very good.  Now here comes the bad:  1. There were fruit flies EVERYWHERE. I felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump. At one point I had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer. I understand that the establishment is an indoor/outdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table.  2. The place is enormous and they had one, very nice, but over worked server. The girl looked like she was about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving.  3. Because of number two our service in general was not good. I can't totally blame the girl she did the best we could. I mean. I've played Diner Dash on my iPad, I know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working.  It's sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again. I think I'm being very generous by giving it two stars but because I used to love it so much I can't rate it that low. Part of me hopes it gets better, but like an absentee father it'll just let me down again."}
{"text":"Slow service. Food was good but not worth the poor service and lack of professionalism in general. Try the Bar Louie on North Shore in Pittsburgh. I hear it's better.   My wife and I were here with our college daughter in a Sunday afternoon. Place was not busy and that can sometimes mean lower efficiency in the kitchen but come on!! Where's the check? Does everything take this long?  Ugh!!!"}
{"text":"Insanely sticky floors, frozen food that's reheated in a microwave and $10 drinks that tastes like sugar water. Skip this place if you don't want to feel ill after dining."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 6 on a Saturday night. When we arrived we were told by one of the waitresses that they didn't make reservations for less than six.Then she changed that to six or less.  I asked to speak with a manager who told me they don't make reservations for less than ten.  They had no record of my reservation.  The manager was rude.  She asked if I had called the right location.  When I confirmed that I had, it was apparent she didn't believe me.  When I told her I had made the reservation about 10 days earlier during a weekday afternoon and had spoken to a gentleman, she told me they only had one male manager and he said he did not make the reservation.  I was told she could try and find something for us, but there was no way to tell how long that would take since it was a Saturday night.  We didn't stay to find out and have no interest in ever experiencing their brand of customer service again!"}
{"text":"We popped in waiting for a hockey game and ordered some drinks and appetizers off of their happy hour menu. We got the szechuan boneless wings and a chicken quesadilla, both were very good and game us plenty to split. the prices were very reasonable and the martinis were strong and flavorful.  I look forward to going back to try more of their menu but would recommend this restaurant based off of my first experience."}
{"text":"Was here before and the service was terrible. Stopped in tonight for a beer and a water and OMG, the h2o tasted like it could have come from Tempe town lake. NEver understand why bars can't spend $100 on a water filter.... Clean water makes a big difference!"}
{"text":"I've been to Bar Louie a handful of times. Always had a good experience whether I was at the bar, or dining for food. However when my bestfriend and I came to dine on that night of 02/24; service was really bad. This was my first time having a bad experience here. You seat yourself of course, but no open tables were clean, and no one was coming around to clean them. So it took a while to find an appropriate seat. Our waiter was completely oblivious.. we ordered waters, and wings as an appetizer and I swear to you.. she walked by at least 5 times in the following 10-15 minutes and never brought the waters. She brought the tables beside us their drinks but we were just sitting there. When we tried to get her attention, she wouldn't even look our way.. she completely neglected our table.. she came back and took our food order and I reminded her about the water and wings. Another 15-20 minutes went by and she came and sat at the table beside us and laughed and chatted with the customers.. when she finally got up, I tried to wave and call to her to get her attention, and we were again ignored as she went to the next table and again sat and chatted with the 2nd set of customers. We ended up leaving and going to Boardwalk Billy's at the boardwalk which accommodated us perfectly and in a timely manner. I always liked going to Bar Louie but that was a horrible experience. If I go back... I will request to NOT receive that waiter."}
{"text":"I have been going to west gate for years  Never went in bar Louie I assumed probably Expensive .. wrong we had just been at salt they were really over priced and food didn't seem worth it . Blake was great he recommend drinks and food and it all was outstanding we found are new go to place"}
{"text":"On successful visits, the bar offers decent food and drink with a wide variety for decent prices. The atmosphere is decent, but all in all feels like a slightly more expensive and upscale Chili's. However, on multiple occasions, the service was well below acceptable, and unfortunately one of two restaurants in my entire life I walked out of due to not being served.   As a party of six we were ignored for seventeen minutes (we counted down to our ultimatum for walking out) and made multiple attempts to get a table just to get nothing more than ignored or at best a \"someone will be with you shortly\". The restaurant was less than half full, and I it was a pretty bad end to a streak of already unsatisfactory service from previous experiences.  I'm sure that single experience was a rarity, and If you have your heart set on a \"Bar and Grill\" type place in Tempe Marketplace this will do fine for you. In my opinion however, there are better establishments walking distance away."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  This place is mainly a \"bar\" and does get crowded but I really like the pizza here.  In fact I've never had a bad meal.  The staff are ussually very helpful but it does get a bit loud inside when crowded."}
{"text":"Typical bar food. Not the greatest at all. Their food is pre made and frozen then cooked it seems like. Waitress even described a dessert that way. Just eh."}
{"text":"A really great new place to go for late night eats, since they close at 2am every night.  The food is delicious!    We started with the pretzel sticks app, which were fresh and hot!  The dips served along were honey mustard, queso and cinnamon butter (I know, I know...but it was surprisingly wonderful).  And, for our entrees, hubby got the mac & cheese sandwich w/pulled pork and tater tots.  He devoured it!  Hmmmm, I think he liked it.  I got the Backyard BBQ burger and tater tots.  The burger was juicy and perfectly cooked, it had cheese, bbq sauce and onion straws on it...so good!  And, don't judge me, I asked for no bacon (which is part of the burger), and it came just as I asked.  Our waiter, Mike, was friendly and attentive.  Plus, he actually remembered us from a different restaurant, which we hadn't been to in a long time.  So, it was like bumping into an old friend.  The restaurant is really big (inside and out), there are 2 bars and they have live music on Thursday nights.  It was comfortable and spacious...you don't feel cramped inside.  We're already looking forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"Food was great fast service and bar tenders were friendly :) great 2nd date spot!! Loved the servers they were Kind and smiley! That's always a plus!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for happy hour so that's all I have to go by. Honestly, I probably wouldn't be giving this place 4 stars if I had come during a non HH time. The food isn't really that great, but somehow when you're eating appetizers & burgers (on Tues) at half price you're a little less judgey.   As far as drinks go Bar Louie's HH is possibly a slight notch above other Phoenix area HH's (price wise) depending on what you're looking for. $3 on ALL draft beers (not just the cheap stuff), $4 wines, $5 martinis. I've had the martinis (not the fruity ones) and they're fine, but when I say this place is slight notch above other HH's I mostly mean it's because ALL draft beers are cheap.   As far as food goes the first time I was here I only nibbled on some things friends had ordered. The quesadilla was pretty standard, but I really did like the boneless wings. The last time I came I had the crispy calamari, and although they were a little greasy & heavily breaded (they did say \"crispy,\" however) I thought they were fine.   The calamari visit was on a Tues, which is when this place does there $5 burger special (all burgers on the menu are $5 from 5-close, and come with fries or tots). I had a southwest burger, which came with guacamole, jalapenos & jack cheese. I thought the quality was slightly above a fast food burger. Most burgers on the menu are regularly $10-$12, and if I would have paid that much I probably wouldn't be all that kind with this review. At five bucks though (the tots were hot & crispy) I can't complain all that much.   As far as service goes, this last time we actually had a pretty good, attentive server. However, the first couple times I was here I remember service being slow.   I'd come back here if somebody suggested it, and happily drink $3 kilt lifters & eat cheap apps during HH, but Bar Louie certainly isn't a place I'd keep running back to."}
{"text":"I've been to Bar Louie several times and I don't have much to say about the food other than is it average and pretty boring bar food. The one thing different is the option for tater tots which people seem to enjoy. Service is fine and prices average. My most favorite thing from Bar Louie is without a doubt, the Berry Mojito! I want one now they are so good! Made with fresh berries and mint! I must get one every time! You will not be disappointed if you like mojitos! I think they are $10 which some might think is expensive but they are just so good! Good wise, I still haven't had anything I really like and I'd rather just come here for drinks."}
{"text":"I have been here before, and it is better than the predecessor, but I was a little disappointed in my visit. A friend of mine sent me an email about an event for the Prohibition Repeal anniversary. I was impressed with the ad - the bar had a nice ad for the night, created 3 special cocktails to celebrate, and suggested visitors dress the part. I showed up and there was a good number of people, but none of the customers were really dressed up. The staff was somewhat dressed. I had a male bartender and he was in a white shirt with black tie. That could be 1920s, but it could be any day also. The female bartender had an outfit and looked the part. Other than that, it didn't really live up to the hype. I had a Batch 19 beer, but that was it. There was good hype for the event, but I didn't think it lived up to it. When I go to Tempe Marketplace this is not usually my first choice, so this visit didn't really do anything to change my mind."}
{"text":"Won't be coming back here. Seems  like every time I come here the service is so bad. Today I arrived with my coworker for lunch and the place was totally empty. The waitress told us to sit anywhere. It took 10 mins to get services. Waitress came over as we walking out."}
{"text":"I went there and was extremely polite, as well as nicely dressed, Sunday night June 26th around 9 pm.  The bar tender was extremely rude to me and my date.  I received better service at McDonald's. The bar had a total of five people at it yet it was dirty the whole bar and I had to wait ten minutes for her to pick up the prior quests receipts so I could sit down.  Upon sitting told was not even nicely greeted was told \"you have to wait awhile\" I have been in the restaurant business for years and was never treated so poorly. After politely ordering a total of 4 easy drinks to make ( one being a double shot) the tab was 63 in a period of ten minutes.  Around 930 the bartender did not even ask if I wanted another drink or even food at that matter.  Just slapped the tab on the table.  ( now mind you I just got done running a restaurant all night). So I figured just pay.  Even after leaving 11.00 tip I was not even thanked.  The bar tender could have easily sold 2 dinners another two round of drinks making the tab close to 170-180 in a period of twenty minutes.  I will not return.  So just of my business and the many people I refer places your company at minimum had lost 85 grand in one year but such crummy service to one person. We all have bad days. I have had days where I have had deaths in my family and never treated guests so poorly.    Coming from someone in the business, it was horrible experience. Seemed like the regulars were treated better than the new guests.  Not a way to create business.   On a Sunday night it is slow enough, let alone driving away guests.   It was overall a terrible experience.  On further note after many attempts I was never contacted by anyone about this, so I will tell my 400 guests I meet daily to eat elsewhere at the waterfront."}
{"text":"I'd been to a Bar Louie in Chicago and loved it. Was worried about this place after reading reviews on here but thought they were a little harsh. Chips and salsa app was great and sangria by pitcher was good too. Sandwich I ordered was average but my friend loved her food."}
{"text":"Catrina and Corita met me after the Cardinals  game it was super busy but they took the time to make me feel welcome. They were fast at getting us or drinks. Thanks girls."}
{"text":"Remember that line in the film Liar Liar, \"I've had better\"? That was my exact sentiments after eating here. My husband and I split the burger and fries with Swiss cheese and I ordered two glasses of wine and a mango drink my husband wanted, $50 later we were like why it's happy hour? Didn't know the mango drink was almost $20, worse yet, my husband couldn't even drink it because it had too much sugar! Little noisy for my age and taste since I used to live in college town while getting my first Masters degree at Arizona State, other than that we won't be back. We did go to Lucille's BBQ to pop in for a drink afterwards, now that was AWESOME and will be another story for later."}
{"text":"I like this watering hole so close to home. Although anything other than a beer, or one of the happy hour drinks, can be a bit pricey for my style. And beware on $1 burger nights, there's a separate menu where you have to pay extra PER topping, and a side of fries or veggie will cost you $4. a little misleading if you ask me."}
{"text":"Only come here for the food during happy hour; that way you're only wasting half your money.  The flatbreads are terrible; very soggy and doughy.   Do not ever get the Trio of Dips with chips.  The guacamole is tasteless, the queso is super thick like tooth paste, and they only have hot, hot, hot salsa.   The bar itself has a fun atmosphere and the service is decent, just beware of the food."}
{"text":"Great place for food & drinks everything about this place is good!! I'll definitely go back again..   If your at the bar ask for Corita shes amazing!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for happy hour. We went there tonight before a concert at Stage AE. Great service and decent food for a good price. We've been to the Bar Louie in the Waterfront and had a TERRIBLE experience. We decided to give this location a try, and were pretty impressed. Favorite martini is the Clover."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, good appetizers, and good drinks. Waitress was nice and very attentive, even gave us free calamari. Very good, however they did keep trying to sell us on their $5 burger special... But overall will return"}
{"text":"Well after going to Granite for horrible service we paid for drinks and went here instead. Service was much much better. The waitress messed up order and one meal was very late but she was extremely apologetic about it. Food was very good."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great at this location, menu is good for snacking, and going out, but the service is bad.  On three different occasions I have had bad service from the bar staff they acted as if they were annoyed, agitated and took too long to recognize me for service.  Example: After finally being recognized for my  order I ordered a Maker's Manhattan...\"we are out of makers\" very short.  So I asked for Wild Turkey...\"we don't carry Wild Turkey\"...So I asked what do you have her response was...\"we have a long list\".   Excuse me I am the customer suggest and do not be so short. She finally found a drink and brought it to me with no square napkin beneath it as if she was totally bothered.  This same type of service repeated on 2 other occasions I just said forget it I will not be there for a while, maybe never."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on 12/21 when the car died in the parking lot in front of Total Wine. Sat at the bar, great service, cold brew, ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork sammie, ate it ALL, so good! I would skip the cheese on it next time, but otherwise it was good eats."}
{"text":"If there was a way to put less stars Bar Louie would have gotten less. Been several times and service has been mediocre at best. This last time was the worst. Sat down and they took more than 20 minutes just to get drink orders. Ordered a 5 dollar burger and they got the wrong burger. Told the waitress and she did nothing about it. Me and my wife spent about an hour there and they didn't refill out drinks once. It's not worth your money for the terrible service even on 5 dollar burger days. NEVER GOING BACK!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, drink and hang out with friends. There is always a game on and the Bartenders are very friendly and attentive. I am never disappointed when I walk through the door.  Be warned Tuesdays can get pretty busy with $1 Burgers from 5pm to 7pm.  So if your looking for a good night out, stop by Bar Louie. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"3rd time here in as many weeks on Tuesday for happy hour...unfortunately it's gotten worse each time.  The service was slow & it was not that busy. We were a party of 6 and 4 burgers came out & the other 2 took another 10 -15 minutes...never checked back on us, had to flag the waitress down. Wanted BBQ sauce for the dry brisket sliders, she forgot & they were cold by the time we asked again. Need to find another place because they can't handle a relatively slow happy hour. It was like there were so many servers & they were stepping over each other. Then at the end the bill was wrong even after she came to check to see who had what. Very poor experience . Too bad because the burgers are usually good on Tuesday."}
{"text":"I rather like Bar Louie for my outdoor dining experience after biking the rail trail or before a movie.  Been there twice now for both of before-mentioned occasions and both times had their appetizers.  Note that if you can catch them during their happy hour from 5 to 7pm on weeknights, your pocket book will thank you.  The two of us diners selected three appetizers to share the first visit and two on the second visit and were quite satisfied with presentation, quantity, and quality.  I would highly recommend the Bruschetta Pomodoro and the calamari (breaded just right and not overdone)."}
{"text":"This location is now permanently closed. I will miss bicycling here for happy hour appetizers."}
{"text":"Place was dirty and understaffed.  2nd biggest shopping day of year and they didn't have enough workers.  Sent food back as it was bad.  Not coming back"}
{"text":"A-OK In my book! This is a nice little bar in Tempe Market place. It's a good spot to hit before or after a movie. They have happy hour of course, so drinks after work is always fun. I have been here a few times and have been quite happy with the food. The service is hit and miss, sometimes I feel like the staff is unorganized in who takes care of which section, so that can get a bit frustrating. There are a few good food selections here, I definitely recommend their chicken Quesada if you are looking for something small! It's a flavorful little snack filled with moist chicken, cheese, pico, peppers and beans. My other favorite dish is the current special they are running right now. Its parmesan crusted chicken sliders! Yummy!!!! They are these perfect little chicken sliders covered in a delicious parmesan cheese crust, inside two little pieces of bread. They put a little slice of Italian heaven in a bun! Haha! Great idea!  Side note - Tuesday night they have burger night! You can get a burger meal for like $5!! :D"}
{"text":"We walked in and couldn't get waited on and were ignored by the staff. They would make eye contact and walk the other way. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"Recommended for late night kitchen by hotel. It was the worst   Waited 20 min for service to come.  When they came, they were mean, unhelpful and not interested in serving .  Left angry."}
{"text":"When we arrived there were 4 adults and a baby. The greeter had an attitude about the stroller. She then brought a high chair that we didnt ask for and was rude that we didn't want to put the baby in it. The table she prepared for us was dirty and sticky. The manager came over and took our drink orders. We were seated near the bar and the kitchen. It took 20 mins to get our drinks. We watched the bar staff touch ever garnish including ours and a server licking her fingers as she delivered food. We ordered a second round of drinks. My husband was given a smaller beer in a plastic cup but charged the same price as the larger beer. No explanation for this. We counted 21 staff members and only the bartenders and 1 waitress, whom wasn't ours, was actually doing much work. 50 mins after arriving we received our food. A chicken sandwich 2 burgers and a Tuscan chicken pasta. Evertthig was cold except the fries. We complained to the manager but he only offered us a basket of fries. We declined and asked for the bill. That took forever also. We spent 2 hours there with the worst service I have ever experienced, cold food, and unhappy waitstaff. All that we could do was laugh about it."}
{"text":"$1.00 burger night, was great. but the burger was overcooked, burnt and a bit cold. Looked like they just made a whole bunch of burgers and i was the lucky one to get on that had been hanging around for awhile."}
{"text":"I wish could give 0 stars because it's that BAD!!   Stopped in Saturday night and was told there was 1.5 hour wait for food.  The restaurant was only half full and nothing on the menu should take more than 10-15 minutes to prepare.  We decided to have a drink at the bar anyway.  The bartender was very nice and friendly...drinks were good (the ONLY positive)!    On Sunday, we decided to give it another try and stop in for lunch.  We walked in and there was no one at the hostess stand to greet us.  We waited about 30 seconds and someone yelled from halfway down the restaurant to have a seat inside or outside.  We opted for outside as it was a nice day.  When we seated ourselves, a waitress came over and threw menus on the table and said she'd be right back.  A different  waitress came over and immediately told us that they ran out of fries last evening and that she would see if there were any today but she couldn't guarantee it since she just got there.  We placed our orders and she came back within minutes to let us know that there were no fries.  We said that's fine we'd go with the tater tots.  She then came back and told us that they are also out of bacon, turkey and short ribs for the sliders.  That was 3 of the 4 things we ordered.  We were given menus again but at that point just decided to cut our losses and left.  We will never be  back again.    What a huge disappointment!!  The manager of the restaurant should be embarrassed for this establishment.  Bar Louie is located in a prime spot and could be an amazing time.  Such a shame!!!"}
{"text":"haha only came here once for happy hour, but i am just pleased with the price. i guess coming from ny, anything would be better price wise. $3 for draft and a big selection of beers so good times. also it's right across the theater so it's a good place to go and chill before the movie starts.. which is exactly what i did haha."}
{"text":"The bar service was fantastic during happy hour!!  Thank you Corita and Catrina.  The Coyotes were playing and the place was packed.  $5 martinis for Happy Hour you have to try the Smores Martini it was yummy!"}
{"text":"Came in for drinks and a quick bite before the TSwift concert last night. It was super busy but we were able to find seats at the bar. The bartenders did a great job! Although there were tons of people standing around the bar, we were able to order our drinks and they came fast. The chicken nachos came out pretty quick and it was good.They were playing alot of songs by Taylor Swift and Camila so it set us in a good mood before the show."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend on a Saturday night to get a few drinks.  We came at around 9:30 and there were plenty of seats available at and around the bar.  The bartenders were very friendly and prompt the whole time we were there.  I started with the \"Tickled Pink\" martini, which was delicious! It basically just tasted like juice, which was fine with me.  I honestly couldn't taste the alcohol at all.  For my second drink I decided to try the \"Orange Mule\". I'm a huge Moscow Mule fan, so I was excited to try this twist on it. I was honestly a little underwhelmed with it.  It had a very sour flavor, which I wasn't expecting, but it was still good.  Bar Louie is one of those restaurants that doesn't put prices on their drink menu, which is always annoying to me, but each drink was $10.  I enjoyed my drinks, but I'm not sure they were worth $10 a piece.  It did look like they had some good food and drink specials during the week which would be more worthwhile! I would definitely come back, but probably when I could get a better deal on drinks!"}
{"text":"I wasn't till hubby made a comment. Place was clean. Hubby liked his food. Waitress Amy was another thing, couldn't  keep up. Got our drinks and within 5 min the ice in the tea had disappeared. Requested a glass of nothing but ice. She deliver only a half glass in the mean time she topped off our tea with no ice for hubby. Let's  make this clear, ice tea needs lots of ice. It took foreverrrrr to receive our food. Mine, the bun was hot, mushrooms cold, meat not done especially when I requested done. Tater tots hot and good. Hubby's food was what he stated was good and had a good flavor. Both of us also noticed not one employee had a smile on their face, not one. In fact it looked like they did t even want to be there. At this time with the service and other things not worth the money."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area while my fianc√© goes back to ASU for his MBA and saw that they were listed on the Tempe Marketplace website to receive a 15% discount with an ASU ID, so we decided to check it out. We stopped in for drink & an app. and everything was fine. The restaurant/bar is nice and I'd like to come back for lunch or dinner but to be honest I'm pretty annoyed right now and don't know if I will. When we received the bill my fianc√© asked about the student discount and we were told they don't do any discounts. He pulled the offer up on his phone to show our server, and then she proceeded to step away to talk to her manager. When she returned she told us that they are not honoring the discount and are apparently \"fighting with Tempe Marketplace right now to get that removed\". I call bullshit. I work in marketing and I find it very hard to believe that the business was not willingly involved in this promotion. Corporate or franchise it doesn't matter... It is posted online as well as on signage all over the shopping center! I believe the staff hasn't fully been educated and I blame the \"manager\". I've worked in food & beverage and it's not completely unheard of for certain deals & promos to be running without the staff being fully aware but why would you not honor it when presented with proof? I honestly don't care about the small discount itself but the principle of the matter! We left and ran into a sign around the corner which I'm posting. Really just annoyed and disappointed. Our server was nice but if this is bar Louie's way for doing business... Or free marketing then they deserve to be called out."}
{"text":"Nice spot to hang out.  The Beef Brisket Sliders and the Chicken Verde Flatbread are very good.  Our server, Anthony, is a rising junior at UNCC and he's the best server we've had since we moved to Charlotte.  He is courteous, smart and FAST."}
{"text":"51 minutes to make a salad, a S A L A D. Not worth the hype, drinks are pricy, food isn't anything special and Jesus Christ 51 mins waiting on a salad. They weren't even busy! Not the first time this long wait for a SALAD has happened. I won't be back. Didn't even get our food, had to be somewhere. Thanks for wasting my time and enabling me from eating."}
{"text":"I went here a couple of weeks with friends. Our server Stony was the bomb! This was her second day we could not tell. She was knowledgeable about the menu and she provided us prompt courteous service. I had the veggie flatbread. It was very good. Me and a friend shared the boneless wings plain. They were good and seasoned just right. The only reason why I am not giving a 5 star is because our appetizer the tortilla chips were stale and the salsa was horrible. Our server promptly got us fresh chips. I recommend this place. I like that it stays open till 2am."}
{"text":"Food is always good. However... Service is awful. 5 tables in the place on a Sunday afternoon took 15 min. For someone to come to our table and get drink orders. Another 15 min. Before drinks were delivered by another server and food order was taken. Food was brought to our table by a completely different server and order was wrong. Order was fixed and our original server came to the table and acted like nothing happened with our order didn't apologize or ask if we were ok actually asked if we needed boxes and the check. No... We would like to order another drink. She says ok I'll be right back. 15 min. Later came back with the check....!?!?! The servers really need to be retrained on how actually serve a table and move faster."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for late night drinks. The service was fantastic. The drinks were delicious although a little pricey for my taste. I had the lettuce wraps and they were soooo good! The fries are also crispy and great to dip in ranch dressing. It has great d√©cor and romantic lighting-good for a date night."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time!! Drinks maybe food NO WAY  This is one of the few times I did not listen to my fellow Yelpers and as alwas regretted it big time. I had previously gone to this establishment for Happy Hour and it was ok but then I made the big mistake of going for dinner. In short food was cold, order was wrong, service was terrible.   There were 3 of us and dinner lasted 3 hours because it took the waiters about 30 minutes to initially come check on us just to take a water order and give us menus. We order chips and salsa and that comes out another 25 minutes later. The chips are so stale you can't even bite into them I ask the waitress to try one and she admits they are like rubber and then just stares at us. Normal customer service would be to ask if we'd like something else instead but not at Bar Louie. After literally hunting down our waitress we are finally able to order our food but then we don't see her again for another 45 minutes with our cold food. What a terrible experience I wasted 3 hrs and wasn't even able to eat any of my food basically paid to waste my time."}
{"text":"My sons a and I came for Tuesday Dollar Burger Night. You can gat a \"burger\" (beef, chicken, portabella, or turkey) in a bun with lettuce for a buck. Then you can add toppings to complete your burger at a small cost-cheese 75 cents, veggies 50 cents, Artery Cloggers 75 cents, sauce 25 cents. Those are the headings and they have items listed under them-like 9 different cheeses. You can also get a basket of tots or fries for a small price as well.  My burger was $2.25 after I added toppings. Is it the best burger I've ever had? No. But is it the best $2.25 burger I've ever had?  Yes. It's kind if a Russian roulette as to how your burger will come to you cooked. Mine was well done and one if my son's burger had pink in the middle. We probably could have sent it back but we don't mind a little pink.  I love the tater tots!  They are crispy and have the right amount of salt. Yummy!! Our server was great and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bar Louie is suppossed to be a somewhat swanky martini kinda bar. The others that I have visited, exuded that modern, swanky, professional charm.  However, this particular one seems to lack that touch of class.  This place is situated right across from the Hilton, so I figure there must be a good bunch of traveling business types, but nope.. I had a very loud table next door doing shots of sake..  I just did not expect such a crowd at Bar Louie.  The food was so-so.. I had their fried tempura and dumplings.. The former was worst than fast food fried shrimp. .so much batter.  The latter was a mistake..   Anyhoo.. I left quickly, never to come back.. very dissapointed that this brand has dropped their standards so much.."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and all I can say is wow this place is awesome! Came in for lunch and melissa was our bartender. The food was good and the drinks were great! She mentioned they have a new menu coming out soon so we will definitely be back! Its service like she gave  that makes going out to eat enjoyable."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dined at Bar Louie at the Waterfront about a month ago; it was my first time eating there and I was pretty impressed!  We got loaded nachos as an appetizer and all the toppings were as fresh as they come, not to mention delicious!  I ordered pasta (I cannot remember the name) but I asked for no artichokes in it. It turned out the artichokes were pre-mixed in the recipe, but the waitress came and informed us that the chef was whipping up a special batch just for me! I was extremely grateful and impressed.  Everything was delicious, the decor was industrial chic (which I love) and the atmosphere was buzzing and fun. The menu was a tad exotic for my small-town pallet, but it was great. My only complaint was the fact that you had to seat yourself, because we wandered around the crowded restaurant for about 10 minutes before we found a seat. The food and service certainly made up for it though!"}
{"text":"Came in the other night and had the extreme pleasure of having a young lady named Nicole. Super fast service very cheerful and my kids loved her. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The past few times I've been to this place they have excellent service. The drinks are always on point and creative. The presentation is everything!"}
{"text":"I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around. All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers.  I am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired.  This is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined.   As I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service."}
{"text":"this is our 2nd time there. The first was right after it opened. This time around our server was very absent. Brought our appetizer out with the meal. Did not come around periodically to check drinks or how the food was.  My blackberry salad was definately a different salad but SO delicious. I will still go back hoping for a different server"}
{"text":"I previously mentioned that this location was the most pleasing Bar Louie location. I lied.  After two more experiences once during a Happy Hour and one after work with colleagues, I can easily say I will not re-visit anytime soon. Reasons? Service.  It's unfortunate that this establishment has been leveled by its abysmal service. The first time my colleagues and I were trying to enjoy a simple happy hour and were constantly bothered by the waiter making the same joke over and over and insistently being part of conversation. I'm fine with that, but context clues my man; When people are having a private conversation they often aren't inviting of the waiter.  The second time was unprofessional, insulting and down right rude. A colleague of mine waited 15min without getting asked a single question at a high top table. This was before 6 more of my colleagues and I joined her another 15 min (no exaggeration) and not so much as a \"one min, I'm sorry.\" Nothing. We were able to wave down a waiter and let him know we were waiting for 30 min, when he rudely replied, \"Yea, it's kinda busy, you're gunna have to be patient.\" So we got up and left and let the seating hostess know that we were leaving and she seemed unconcerned as well. Behavior like that is just bad for business. I'm not picky, I don't think high of myself. I'm a friendly guy and a friendly tipper. But when you are with your colleagues from a business that is a partner of the establishment you expect at VERY LEAST to be acknowledged within half an hour of being in the establishment.   Don't waste your time. The staff will just put a bad taste in your mouth. Even if the food is good. Damn shame."}
{"text":"We are down here for the CLE Christmas Bar Crawl, paid $20 each and this place is SO UNDER STAFFED! It's ridiculous. We left after ordering. Met up with at least 8 couples who did the same. I feel sorry for the waiters. I will never back."}
{"text":"The past few times I've come here I have been VERY disappointed. Tonight I witnessed a manager scream at one of his employees RIGHT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE. He even used the F word to this young girl. It was awful. My husband and I left immediately and WILL NEVER BE BACK!!! I seriously feel like calling someone and reporting this horrible manager. I still might. I'm so upset."}
{"text":"No  paper towels No beer prices  No cocktail prices (but wine prices ?) Yelp and Google maps wrong  Good Tuesday burger special."}
{"text":"A salad, by definition being a simple combination of predetermined items one has on-hand, is usually difficult to mess up.  Leave it to Bar Louie to accomplish such an unlikely feat.  I ordered the Blackberry, Orange, & Brie salad: mixed greens, brie, oranges, blackberries, pecans, bacon,¬†basil, and bacon vinaigrette.  The menu gives the option to add salmon and I took them up on this offer.  For those keeping track, that's nine items.  My salad arrived without one-third of them.  No salmon.  I asked and the server returned, salmon in hand.  Also, no bacon.  I asked, and was presented with a cup of cold, whole slices of bacon.  I've never met a piece of bacon I didn't like.  So, I spread the bacon lovelies out and grabbed my knife to cut them.  But this bacon, I discovered, was caked with cold congealed bacon grease - gross.  I sent the salad back.  I just couldn't bring myself to chomp on chilled bacon fat. For the first time in the history of this diehard devotee of the pork candy, I found a bad piece of bacon. Or at least the kind of chef who can manage to destroy two seemingly foolproof food items: bacon and salad.  To add insult to injury the service time was abysmal. I came from work with a group of about ten.  We called the day before to make a reservation for noon after being assured the restaurant would be able to serve us in an hour.  We arrived just before noon and ordered by 12:10.  Our food arrived in five stages, one brought by an apologetic manager, and the last not arriving until after 1."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. We sat for 10 minutes before my wife had to ask the hostess to track down our server. The food was slow getting to the table and was cold. My wife  never got a single refill on water, and we had get up and  ask the bartender for eating utensils napkins.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I'm sitting at the bar at this moment and have been sitting here for 20 minutes now and haven't been greeted by a single bar tender, waitress or any staff at all."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and atmosphere! We had humus and then each for a meal. The three of us tried each other's and everything great! Quality selection of draft beers."}
{"text":"No real complaints, we went just to grab a drink during a holiday and sat at the bar. Service was fast and the each drink was made well. Price is right around 9-10 for a drink. Nice spot to watch a game as well or just grab something different. They do have a decent happy hour advertised."}
{"text":"Keep this short and sweet:  - Over priced drinks - Waited over thirty minutes for our waitress to take our order - Waited another 20 to actually get our drinks  Not worth it at all.  Beer and well (house) drinks are way over priced.  Will not be returning when there are so many other bars in the area."}
{"text":"My significant other and I have season tickets for our local hockey team, so we are at Westgate very often & have come to this restaurant a lot. The food has always been fantastic, never any complaints with that. And for the most part, the staff have been friendly and accommodating.   But I gotta say, management really needs to get it together.  They have NO system in place for seating. The hostess station consists of a table and a piece of paper.   Many times when we've come to the restaurant there has been no wait and the hostess would walk us to any random table (it didn't seem like she had any sort of plan, just wandered aimlessly to an empty table) and asked if it was okay. Other times staff would just shout \"come in, sit anywhere you'd like\".  And all these times it was fine.  We had to wait a while for service or for food before,  but nothing too terrible.    But if there is ever a wait at this restaurant? Forget about it. You should probably just go somewhere else that's more organized.  They won't be able to give you an estimated wait time, and no buzzer to let you know when it's your turn. I honestly feel bad for the hostess who has to just handle it without any support, and no organization, no real system to use for prioritizing seating, etc.  Bottom line, you'll probably like the food, but don't come here if you're in any sort of hurry. I would also suggest avoiding weekends or busy dinner hours."}
{"text":"Never ever will go there again!!! We had a networking get together group of 6, 3 of us got there early and was able to order a drink within ok time but that was the only drink we were able to get, our friends showed up bit after that and didn't get help from anyone, we asked several staff members who was waiting on us but no one helped us 30 minutes went by and then we decided to leave !! We just couldn't order anything food or drinks we asked to speak to manager but he never showed up this place is a TOTAL Joke for service don't waste your time !!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a neat atmosphere and is a great fleece to hang out with friends after work. They have a great deal on Tuesdays after 5pm: burgers are $5! I had the fried Louie and it was delicious and pretty big. I believe the burger is originally priced at $11 so it was a steal for $5. Our waitress was very nice and checked up on us throughout our dinner.   The burger was juicy, and the bacon and egg were very flavorful. I'll be back next Tuesday!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are great and not too pricey. Service is mediocre at best and I wouldn't recommend coming here when they are busy. Last time I was here on a busy night, it took our waiter 10 minutes to greet us, another 15 to get us waters, and another 20 minute wait for beers. I don't love this place because servers are never very friendly and don't seem to care at all about the customers. However, they have really great happy hour deals so it's worth a try."}
{"text":"This place is no better and no worse than Darcy McGee's, although I do believe Darcy's allowed dogs on the patio and I'm not sure about Bar Louie.  First and foremost, it took FOREVER to get a menu, and once we got those, it took FOREVER to put in our order. Don't you realize that people here are trying to catch a movie at a certain time? Luckily when I came with some friends, we had a good hour and half before movie time (didn't mean to come early, tickets were sold out for the show we wanted to go to at Harkins movie theater next door).  One we finally got our drinks, everything was okay. The atmosphere of this place is an improvement over Darcy McGee's (previous restaurant at this location). For a chain restaurant, there is a certain \"feel\" to this place that I enjoy. If I squinted the whole time, I would have felt like I was in a big city--which I think is the designer's goal.  If you're going to a movie on a date, this is a good place for you. You'll be spending a lot of time chatting and getting to know each other while you wait for your server. If you're going to a movie with friends, go someplace more casual beforehand like Genghis Grill."}
{"text":"It's your simple bar and grill, kinda like applebees. But holy cow the service is slowwwww. It honestly took an hour to get our food. At 1 point they said the kitchen lost our ticket so they wanted to confirm what we got. Now for the food we got chicken quesadilla and boneless wing. The quesadilla was a solid 8 out of 10. The wings I would say 4 outta 10. The sauce didn't have much flavor and the wings just tasted like someone cut up chicken breast and cooked it with sauce. No breading or anything. Won't be getting wings here again. The atmosphere was nice I'll say that much"}
{"text":"Love this place !!! Best specials all week long!!! Great food and a fun place to hangout !!!"}
{"text":"Way way way over prices drinks. Like ridiculously over priced. And the tables all wobble.."}
{"text":"This is the third time I have been here, in from out of town, coworkers picked the place.  The food is horrible, every time.  I ordered chicken tacos, the corn tortillas were stuck together and hard as a rock on one side, the Chicken looked like it was put through a food processor and pulverized, and had no flavor.  Others were less than impressed.  The beer was cold and a great price and our server was attentive, those were the only positives..."}
{"text":"Sit at the bar or bar stools and your service should be as excellent as ours. All the martinis we had were \"on Pointe.\" For the university, they've upped the ante..."}
{"text":"I've been to Bar Louie a handful of times before and it's always been good. I recently went to the North Shore location and had a wonderful experience. I was with a party of 10 and we wanted to sit outside so they sat us right away. They were very accommodating to our large party. Our server was amazing! She had great suggestions and everything came out perfect! Everyone loved their food and kept saying how delicious it was. You must get the bruschetta...one of the best bruschetta's I've ever had and I love the presentation. Also, the burger sliders were really good and a decent size, very filling. All the food is reasonably priced. Everyone in our party left satisfied. Great food, great service, great experience!"}
{"text":"Went to this location for the first time, and had an amazing time! The staff was friendly, the food was great and the drink were delicious and quick. This will definitely be my new go to spot at westgate! And the happy hour is really good also."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time! Torri had wonderful service. Food was great and the drinks were better."}
{"text":"I went here on St. Patty's Day and had a blast!  They had great drink specials.  I ate a Mediterranean Brochette with Shrimp on it and the shrimp was weird.  The rest was fabulous.  They have an awesome fire pit out back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the happy hour half price drinks and appetizers. My lemon drop martini was excellent and my husband said his crispy calamari was the best he's had. Our waiter, Sage, was the best."}
{"text":"I have been to this location two times now and I'm so disappointed. I use to love bar Louie and thought they where such a great place to eat. I use to go to the one in station square all the time before it closed down. But anymore I'm just so disappointed with the service and the quality of food. You would think being open in the north shore by some big name food places even stage ae, pnc park, Heinz field. You would think they would strive for quality and sadly I think that's last. I wanted to come one more time before I wrote a review being I thought it was a bad night but I was wrong. The first time the food was slow and way to over cooked. Each time I been here it's been after 7pm and no ones here. They even seem over staffed in front of the house but I guess that's different for the kitchen. I wanted to give the wings a try one last time and once again disappointed. Way to over cooked Once again I just don't understand. I'm assuming it's the wings them self coming in large batches messed up and there just not picked out and made over cooked. Next thing I wanna point out is what happened to $1 burger night? The waterfront location has it listed on there site that they still do it. The waiter had mentioned that all burgers where now $5 bucks and included fries. So I decided to try the (spiked bulleit bourbon burger) and what a let down. The burger was over cooked from me asking for it medium rare. The bun did not seem fresh, the overall taste of the burger was good but it could have been so much better. A big note to mention is I guess with the burger being $5 bucks they skip on the fries cause I had almost none on my plate. When the bill came my burger said it was $6 and my guest was $5. Both burgers being short on fries and just overly disappointed. I really hope things change because I use to love bar Louie but any more I'm not sure if I'll be returning sadly."}
{"text":"Great for late night the only one open passed midnight on a Monday night at Westgate! Would go again for their reverse happy hour for the wings,dip and alcohol!"}
{"text":"Should have checked the reviews before we went. I've been to \"real\" Bar Louie's in other cities. This is not one of them. Was seated for 20 min and no wait staff came to take our order. Several of them made eye contact but did not feel the need to ask if we had been waited on. Awkward. Then someone came over with two plates of food trying to serve us. We thought, here was our big chance to get served, but no, she just walked away. So we left. There are so many restaurants where you can get burgers, just go someplace else."}
{"text":"I normally like Bar Louie for a quick drink and an easy meal -- especially on things like Dollar Burger Night. However, after last night's experience, I doubt I will be returning for QUITE some time.  We walked in around 7 or 7:30 on Tuesday evening for some burgers and were greeted by no one. After standing there for a minute or two, wondering if we seated ourselves or if we should keep waiting, we were told in passing, \"Sit wherever you want.\" We sat at the first table we saw -- it was busy but not overwhelmingly so, as there were still a number of empty tables. People who walked in after us also sat with ease.  That's where the ease ended. We sat at our table for 20 minutes with anyone from the waitstaff as much as saying, \"hello.\" Those who sat after us were waited on, but we just sat there. The table next to us was served by who we anticipated would be our server, as well, but she completely ignored us. We didn't even have menus. We sat at a table with just plates and silverware for 20 minutes before we got up to leave. Servers were even standing near our table when we got up and they said NOTHING as we walked out the door. The door was held open for us by another member of the waitstaff, which was honestly the best service we got all night.  Look, I understand that nights like Dollar Burger Night are bound to be busy. But a server should at least say \"Hello\" to a table and bring them water or, I don't know, a menu. We didn't so much as get looked at. And the fact that those who sat down after us were served shows that it wasn't so much as being too busy to serve new tables, it was a complete lack of attention being paid by anyone who worked there. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"We had a better than outstanding experience tonight at Bar Louie. We had Matt who I later found out was his 3rd night working. He was polite, attententive, and thoughtful. If you ever go there ask for Matt he's a doll. Oh and the food was yummy too!!!"}
{"text":"Forgot to give us an event menu.  Half of us had to reorder.  Didn't get 3/4 of our orders right.  Worst service I've had in a really long time.  Especially since we were only one of two tables in the entire restaurant.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Checked this place out on the first night we were in Cleveland. Heard from our waitress that it recently had opened up and the large crowd on a tuesday made it seem like this was a popular place to be, that and it was dollar burger night. I also know its a chain but being from CA I hadn't had the chance to experience one yet.   We ordered the Bavarian pretzel sticks as an appetizer and these things were amazing! Warm and fresh with three delicious sauces. Being dollar burger night I went with the special. For a buck you get a burger and lettuce and can add various toppings for .25-.50 cents which was a great deal. Everything tasted fine but I was a little disappointed in the bun but how much can you complain when the whole burger was less than a Whopper.   One thing to say is that our waitress was amazing. Super friendly, honest and not overly bothersome. All of us at the table agreed to this and it really helped me give Bar Louie 4 stars. Would love to come back to this place and try some of other menu items, especially the mac n cheese."}
{"text":"The service here just keeps going down, down, down...how they stay in business is beyond me.  I gave this place another try...why oh why??? The s'mores martini never tastes the same. Sometimes I get marshmallows...last time not. Sometimes, chocolate syrup lining glass, sometimes not. In fact, I tried a \"new\" summer tea martini... asked what was in it....waiter asked bartender. I read her lips...she said \"I have no idea\". Waiter came over with a piece of paper, and he rattled off what was in it. Almost sounded like a Long Island ice tea, so I tried it. It tasted like absolute crap! Gross, gross, gross! Save your money people! Even at half price (still pricey), not worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday after work, it wasn't terribly busy.  I like that they have a wall of glass doors so it can be opened up on nice days.  I tried the buffalo chicken flat bread, the sauce had just the right amount of kick.  I also tried the calamari and it was good, cooked right so not chewy.  They have a few appetizers half price for happy hour."}
{"text":"Service was A1! We had this sexy little Latino server named Michael oooo child I could just eat him up with a dab of Cholula on top! But back to the restaurant; great atmosphere, quality food and drinks and great service are what makes Bar Louie in Westlake a must if you're in the area. Safe to say I will be back at this establishment in the near future!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the low reviews. I am a regular here. Perhaps it is a little bit pricey, and that is the concern. But, it seems like everything is pricey these days. Their pretzel appetizer is -fantastic- hot, fresh pretzels with sauces. I also regularly get their grilled vegetable wrap, with broccoli instead of fries, or their salad wedge.   They've got nice outdoor seating with great fire ornaments, but, well, it is outdoors.  In the past, service was really bad. I quit going for a while, after having to \"Do the wave' for a check. But, for the last 2-3 years, it has been really good. I've found the staff to be professional, attentive, responsive, and friendly. Maybe these are old reviews?"}
{"text":"while i have been here several times, i was usually always drinking and never paid attention to how horrible the service is. this time, i came on a saturday with my mom for a (what we thought would be) quick lunch before we got manis & pedis at anthony vince.   i'll start out by saying we got here at 1:30 and didn't get our food until 2:30... i ordered the lettuce wraps and my mom ordered the sliders. we sat at the bar yet still we're constantly glanced over and ignored by the bartender who seemed like she couldn't be less interested in her job. if you're going to be a bartender you better learn how to be friendly.   on top of the terrible service despite the place being half full, the bathroom was absolutely filthy. paper towels piled onto the sink with no garbage to be found.   i can't see why i would ever come back here unless i was dying of starvation and felt like settling for subpar overrated bar food"}
{"text":"This is the TGI Fridays of bars for sure.  I only enjoy it because it reminds me of home (the first BL I frequented with friends was in Homestead, PA).  They all kinda look and feel the same so it's easy for me to feel at home (when in Tampa - I go to that one too).  Food is decent, drinks are good and patio seating with people watching is fun."}
{"text":"If you've ever craved Applebee's but wanted to feel significantly less lame, This. Is. The. Answer.   Like, I am always gonna be irked by Westgate's selection of chains, chains chains everywhere, but this isn't bad. Last time, Bar Louie was where Calico is now. This time, it's had a major upgrade in space. Looks nice. Two different bars. Modest cocktails, with an above average beer selection.   Also, food. Like...really late-night food. Industry people eat here while everyone else is chasing tail at last call. It wasn't even crowded at 1am, and staff is cool. The only Bar Louie that has won me over!"}
{"text":"I don't know about this place. You can't really rate a restaurant just from the first couple of weeks after their grand opening, let alone when they are running a special that crowds the place ($2 martinis + 1st small plate free from 6pm to 9pm). Overall, my experience with the martini and food was that both were delicious, but nothing memorable. Service could be much better but I'll give a fair assessment in a month or two."}
{"text":"We went in here for an early dinner on a Tuesday during the fall.  The whole experience was a disaster.  There was the ever present \"Please seat yourself\" sign, (That seems to be very common from other reviews) just inside the door.  We sat down at a 4 top, and looked around for a server.  There were 2 people at the bar, but no servers in sight.  It took at least 15 minutes for a server to come over and take our drink order, then another 15 minutes to actually get the drinks.  Another 20 minutes later, she came over and finally took our food order.  It was far from busy, with there only being 2 other tables occupied in the whole restaurant.  Our food finally came another half hour later.  It was absolutely terrible!  I had the fish and chips, and the fish was cooked into oblivion.  There was breading, and strings of fish inside of it.  My aunt got the fish tacos.  It said \"Blackened Fish,\" but it looked more like shredded chicken.  The server had to go back and check, when I asked what kind of fish it was, and they said tilapia.  My grandma got the avocado chicken sandwich, and it was dry and tasteless.  I sent back my \"fish\" and chips and asked for the \"fish\" tacos.  They were absolutely inedible!  I wouldn't have fed them to my dog.    I will never come back to this place, and I recommend that anyone pondering this place, avoid it too.  Service is terrible, drinks are way overpriced and the food is disgusting!"}
{"text":"We went here on a whim Sunday night to watch a football game. It was pretty quite, and we sat ourselves at a high top table with good views of the bar televisions.   I ordered a dirty martini on the rocks, and although it was served in a martini glass, the server was quick to get a rocks glass with ice for me when I asked. They have Effen vodka which is one of my favorites!   We had the fried calamari as an appetizer, and it was quite good. It was served with cocktail sauce which was a little different than your typical marinara.   My boyfriend ordered a blue cheese salad that he enjoyed. I had the lettuce cups and they were pretty good, just a little heavy on the salt. I really liked that it came ready for you to build your own. The lettuce was also crunchy and held the filling well.   Bar Louie has awesome specials, including a burger special and drink happy hours during the week. We will definitely come back in the warmer months to sit on the patio and take advantage of those! (Photo taken of specials)"}
{"text":"We had an employee party here in December, and had lots of fun. The food is typical American fare, with burgers, sandwiches, lots of appetizers and a few entree plates. The Moscow mule tasted like it came from a mix, and not enjoyable. The smores martini was delicious, and in the winter they have 12 dogs of Christmas, served with a cinnamon sugar rim. There was a female bartender who was very rude to our group when a couple tried to order a drink at the bar for the parties tab, but our male server took good care of our group and kept up despite having other tables as well."}
{"text":"Save your time and money. Service was terrible. Server acted like we were a bother to her. Food absolutely sucked and took over 40 minutes to come. The place was empty and I see why. Bathroom was disgusting. No soap or paper towels. I won't return here unless forced to. You should do the same."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!!!  AJ is amazing. Great food great service. Very interactive, friendly and perfectly polite!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my partner for light grub and cocktails before a screening a film.  Both times were very pleasant.  The food is not bad (it's nicer bar food, mostly), both of us had salads today and enjoyed them.  The Bloody Marys we had were VERY good.  But, there is no question: our waitperson, Kim, was one of the best servers we've ever had: very nice, pleasant, attentive, friendly, upbeat---she was pretty amazing.  We hope Kim does well---she's an incredibly hard-working server and we'd go back just to sit in her section.  Nicely done!"}
{"text":"So I was planning on giving at least 2 stars but I have been sick ever since I left the restaurant. :-( pretty sure I got food poisoning and will be calling the health department on Monday.   So I have been here a handful of times and always been generally happy with the food and service, other than the priciness of the drinks. Tonight, however, was a different story. The emptiness of the restaurant (on a Saturday night) should have been the first sign of trouble.   I ordered the tuna poke. I got the kimchi on the side because I was worried about the spice. The tuna was not very flavorful and just tasted off....like maybe it had been a sitting around for a few days. It wasn't horrible but I definitely should have trusted my gut and sent it back.   Since I didn't want to end on a bad note I also ordered dessert. I got the key lime shooter. It took over 30 min to come. The waiter blamed it on a busy kitchen. When I pointed out how slow the restaurant was he then said that there were new people training.   The taste was fine although nothing to get excited about.   As we were getting ready to leave I noticed the 90.5 inspection rating.  If this place doesn't make some serious changes I don't see them being open much longer. I know I have no plans to return."}
{"text":"I meet a friend of mine here every First Friday for drinks and appetizers. For the most part we really enjoy everything about this place, just slow service every once in awhile is the only negative. Still worth 4 stars though!!"}
{"text":"I must say, my experience last night at Bar Louie was wonderful. I was hesitant to go because of the other reviews here, but my husband convinced me to give it a try.  The place is seat yourself and it's LOUD in there. I was a little underwhelmed by that at first but I got used to it and found myself enjoying the energy. Our service was fantastic. Courtney was great - super attentive, brought our drinks out in less than 5 minutes, brought our food quickly, checked on us just enough... And the place was packed. The drinks were perfect, just strong enough. We tried the Peach Lighting and the Tiki drink. I liked the tiki thing better but that's just personal choice. There were real berries mixed into that one. Yum. On to the food... My turkey/ham/Brie sandwich was delicious and my husband loved his burger. The highlight of the meal though was the Whiskey cake. Sonnet-worthy. We'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Went for a 40th birthday party. Service was good. Waitstaff worked hard to keep up with drink orders. It was a pretty big party & some major cash was spent. Picked up my tab at end of night & very reasonable DESPITE that they added a 20% gratuity onto everyone's bills. Wonder how many drunk people accidentally tipped 40% that night?! Now here comes the one-star... a party attendee had her handbag stolen from the bar. It happens. But guess what! Half the contents turned up behind the bar (where only staff could have accessed). Cops called - big to-do. Manager was less than helpful- without talking to staff said it absolutely couldnt be one of them. Miraculously - remaining contents turned up the next day - including jewelry & cash. What an honest thief! Reeks of inside job. STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very laid back and welcoming. The Ultimate Bloody Louie, their version of a Bloody Mary, is the best Bloody Mary I ever had. The food is very tasty too! I will be coming back here. They have live music on certain nights and $5 hamburgers on Tuesdays. Definitely my type of place!"}
{"text":"Visited before Pirate game 6/23.   Seated ourselves and was acknowledged quickly.  We ordered a flatbread sandwich and chicken philly. Food was good and well presented. Wife ordered a gin martini and I asked for the \"house \" Cabernet.  Always thought house meant reasonable.  This cab was 13.49 a glass.....after getting bill noticed the price and looked through menu and saw at least 2 other cabs that were 8.00 to 9.00.  I guess it was my fault for not looking first but this definitely cut into the tip.  Just a warning..look at the price of the \"house\" wines."}
{"text":"We went to have a drink and grab dinner before the Pirates game on a Friday night, we walked in and were told that there was no seating outside (when there clearly was) the hostess then convinced us to stay because it was happy hour and we wouldn't be able to sit outside anywhere else anyways (even though we easily could have) so reluctantly we stayed. We were obviously in a rush with our pirates gear and the game starting at 7:05, and tried ordering our food and drinks at the same told and our waiter told us that we couldn't. After an hour of waiting and our waiter never came over to see how we were doing if needed anything, finally he came over and told us that our food be right out, and asked again what one of us ordered confusing what they ordered with a salad instead of a sandwich like they had ordered. 15 more minutes pass by and our waiter is avoiding our table, and seeing people who has sat down long after us receive their food, the manager comes to tell us again, that our food will be right out and asks us if we need anything, and we state that we are good on water and drinks. He brings us out chips and salsa. Another 15 minutes and I finally get my chicken Caesar salad, no one else got their order, and I got my entree before my appetizer. 10 more minutes and my friends finally get their sandwiches and I get my spinach & artichoke dip which the chips were not totally cooked and honestly Applebee's has a better spinach and artichoke dip. My friend's fries were cold and yet again entrees before appetizers. Our one friend still didn't receive their food. At this point it's 7:20 and we've gotten half of our order after putting it in over an hour before. 7:30 and we all have our meals and appetizers, yet our waiter never bothers to come over, ask if there is anything that can be cleared, refills needed, or how the food is. Finally our waiter comes over to hand us coupons for free appetizers at our next visit, I can promise you I will not be returning, so if you're looking to be a half hour late, starving, and thirsty, I have a free coupon for you. Hit me up."}
{"text":"Staying in the immediate area and decided to stop in here for lunch. Nice big place! Atmosphere is very good too. Granted, I did come on a Saturday afternoon kinda early so it wasn't very crowded which is fine by me! So, I can't speak for the crowd at night time but for the daytime, nice and calm in here.   The service was very good as well. Nice and attentive waitress. She came by atleast three times during my lunch to make sure everything was good and if I needed anything else. I like when they keep checking on you.   So about the food. Um yea.... Wasn't very crazy about it. I ordered two appetizers to split because I knew I was having a big dinner in a few hours. So, ended up getting the meatballs al forno appetizer and the trio dips and chips appetizer. The chips and dips was pretty good. It came with three dipping sauces and some nacho chips. I mean- you can't go wrong with that lol The queso dip was my favorite out of the three. So then on to the meatballs. It looked delicious but once I ate one it was very bland. It had no flavor to it at all. And the sauce was watery. It kinda tasted like it was frozen and they popped it in the microwave and threw some shredded cheese over it. I mean, I know some bar type places do this anyway- but atleast make it taste like there was effort put into it lol! I wasn't too happy with it. The buttered bread it came with was very tasty though.   I mean, I only tried the two things but maybe the meatballs isn't their best appetizer lol So- maybe stop by and try something other than that? Again, the chips and dips was good. Oh! And ordered some drinks and they were alright, kinda weak. 4 drinks though cost 39 bucks so bleh to that. The food was affordable though.   Overall not a bad place. Just stay away from the meatballs lol"}
{"text":"Place has promise -location, ambiance. Food and service - needs work."}
{"text":"I've eaten just once, mostly I go for drinks. Nice, lively place, nice outdoor seating for the summer and fall. Drinks are good, service is good. Location is great as well, right across the movie theater."}
{"text":"Decided to go out for a nice evening out. Never been to Bar Louie. Walked in and no one to be found, went up to the bar they said find any table to sit at. We have been here for 20 minutes! Not one server has come to greet us.  And so I walked inside The same time as this guy behind me who was also upset he has not been seated. We both tell a server she says to the guy let me get your drink order. She never came to my table who is next to the guy. Another 10 mins go by now 30 minutes. My friend goes to find someone to take our order. Some girl comes apologizes but not sincerely. Takes out drink order. I give it to her for pretending it's not a huge deal to leave your guest unattended for 30 minutes with no water or anything!   Do not come here and do not expect this place to stay open with poor management! I will tell everyone who comes to West gate and unfortunately for you it's a lot of customers!    Zero stars !"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! I arrived and sat down with my party of 6 at 7 pm. I came there to sit on a patio and enjoy my sisters' company but our experience at the restaurant soured our entire outing with one another. We all live in different states, decided to spend our time together at your restaurant and it completely ruined what little time we do get to spend with one another. Now I will continue my story. There was no wait to be seated and the restaurant was about at 1/4 full. We ordered water and 3 alcoholic beverages, a soda, and milk for my daughter in addition to our meals upfront because we were starving. Our waitress came back 15 minutes later with two drinks and no water, milk, one alcoholic drink or soda. She returned 15 minutes later with water and milk, my sister still hadn't got her drink. Note that we still had no silverware or napkins at this point. She then came out 10 minutes later with a salad and no appetizers. At this point we had been waiting to eat for 45 minutes. I went in and asked for silverware and came back out. The other appetizer arrived at that point. I went in to talk to the manager because we waited 45 minutes for appetizers and complained. We noticed the table that sat across from us (I saw them get seated 5 minutes prior to us being seated) had already gotten their drinks, appetizer, and food. The manager  apologized that the kitchen was backed up due to call offs. She said that our food was up next. I said OK and sat down. After waiting an hour to get our meals every meal was wrong and tasted horrible, not to mention some of the food was missing.  My sisters wings were under cooked, my food was cold and tasteless, so was my other sister's food. At this point I went back inside for a third time to talk to the manager. I told her the communication between from the waitress was awful, she (the waitress) never once mentioned the kitchen being under staffed. When she did it was after my initial complaint and she said we would receive 15 % off. She was serving other tables before us as we watched them come in after us and leave before us, I began to get more and more upset. What makes us different from any other table? We are all African-American. I really loathe having to say that I was mistreated because of my race but that is the only reasoning that I can come up with for the maltreatment that we received. She was by far the worst waitress that I have ever had. She ignored us, never checked in, and was short when she brought our food to the table. Note that they were not under staffed for waiters, only in the kitchen. My daughter's flatbread came out and the rest of the food finally but it was still incorrect. At this point the manager offered a complimentary round of drinks, a free app, and a discount on the bill. She stated that she was sorry and the waitress has trouble with large parties. I went back to the table to try to eat but the food was sub par so that did not happen.The manager brought the drinks to the table herself and we informed her of the poor quality of the food. She offered boneless wings to my sister instead of the wings she had and my sister said that she would take them because we were still waiting on one drink so we had a little time. Well we finished our drinks and the bill came before the boneless wings. When the bill arrived the amount was wrong. We were charged for the second round of drinks ( that were supposed to be on the house),  and gave us a nine dollar discount on a $100 bill. I then went in AGAIN to talk to management. She removed the boneless and the bone in wings, removed the drinks, an app and a percentage for the wait. The bill came to $78. I was tired and sick of being in a restaurant that did not want us there anyway so I paid (NO TIP!!!) and went home. Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"I was staying at the nearby hotel On business so it was a very short walk. Good atmosphere especially with the big open doors on a nice day. Alicia is a great server -- always a smile and very attentive and easy to talk to. The food is okay but hey it's mainly a bar. Interesting variety of Menu options. The salmon sliders were a good idea but way too dry."}
{"text":"Worst bar I have ever been to. They used maybe no alchohol in their drinks and consistency had no meaning here. We ordered three berry mojitos and they were different significantly. I posted a picture, you judge."}
{"text":"Great bar, and good food. The service is great and the patio is great. Awesome place to grab a drink before and / or after a movie."}
{"text":"I should have ran fast after walking in, the place smelled. The service was horrible. The food terrible, the buffalo chicken flatbread pizza was dry and flavor less. The staff must like the food because they were all sitting in the corner eating. The bathrooms dirty. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Come in every Tuesday for $5 burger night and happy hour. Love seeing the girls behind the bar corita and catrina are my favorite they're always smiling and laughing with me and my friends. Be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible.   Long waits for our server to ever return to the table.  Food was mediocre.   Fish tasted spoiled.  Overall not a good experience.   Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Only been here once but have no intentions of going back. The drinks and food are overpriced and not worth what you're paying. The food was less than memorable and the service is decent but nothing to rave about. I went with my husband and another couple and the atmosphere is upbeat and would be perfect for a happy hour but only with specials. Otherwise, you won't get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I hate giving two stars but this place has no redeeming qualities except for the two friendly employees I had interaction with.  Yes the happy hour specials are decent, but the beer is watered down.. They need to change their kegs!  The entire place also felt really.... Sticky.  Weird.  Like beer was spilled everywhere and not properly cleaned."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible experience this week at Bar Louie. On Thursday my friend and I went to dinner and sat on the patio. It took at least 10-15 minutes for our drinks to be served after we placed our order. We then ordered our salads, my salad came out incorrect. I had it remade, to only have it made incorrect for the second time. We saw our waitress cross the street to grab Starbucks during our meal - while I was sitting there waiting. My friend completed her whole meal while I was still waiting to have mine remade."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came for $1 burger night and the food was delicious! I am not a huge bread fan; I usually eat my sandwiches open faced but I loved the buns. My boyfriend ordered a $1chicken and a $1burger  and got both chicken. That wouldn't be a big deal if the service made up for mistakes. We love the atmosphere and taste of food but the service is horrible. This review is not based on a one night experience. Out of three different times we have experienced bad service- very inattentive. Managers need to review the importance of service with their staff.  If some one likes you and you are attentive to their needs, they are less likely to complain! Bit when you are ignored and they make mistakes, most make it a point to bring it to a managers attention!"}
{"text":"Great food and drink specials but service needs improvement!!! There's no hostess so when you walk in you're confused on where to go. Then someone yells \"sit wherever you want!\". Oh, and they need a bust boy pronto! Customers standing but nowhere to sit because they tables are full of dirty dishes. Just come for the food and drink specials on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"My friend and I always try a new place each time we go out. When you enter Bar Louie there is a sign to seat your self. So we went outside and found an open table. I asked a nearby server if it was okay if we took the empty table and she looked at me like I was crazy and said \"ya\". We decided the air blowers outside were too intense and loud that we we look around inside for open seats. We found one and I again, just to have manners asked the server of it was okay if we took the table. This server was ruder than the first and again we got weird looks and a quick \"ya\". We left. Nothing makes you want to stay more at a restaurant than no hostess and no decent courtesy. So sad , I was looking forward to trying it out. At least we know where not to go now."}
{"text":"All time all star service every time (about 5) in the last two years and I gotta say their best menu item was the clams baked in beer. Wish they'd bring it back but I moved on. Their pretzels are amazing served with three different dippins and salty. The fish tacos are delightful, especially without the cheese. They have great drinks and friendly people open late at Tempe marketplace is a desirable thing when movies go late."}
{"text":"Came in to try out the brunch menu. Unfortunately I left thoroughly unimpressed. We ordered the hangover helper and the breakfast nachos. The hangover helper was good at first, but got worse and worse and you kept eating it. It was so salty once you got down to the tater tots and really grossed me out. The onions were also all grouped at the bottom so once you got there you were eating cheesy, salty, onions which was not great. The nachos were even less satisfying. The presentation was bad and the taste even worse. The eggs were undercooked, the salsa had a weird taste, and half of the chips on the plate were completely plain. We paid about $27 for the two meals and it was not worth it. Spend a little extra and get some better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Waited over 2 hours....no food.  Got our own drinks at the bar.  This was at lunch on a Saturday.   No excuses .  Terrible service"}
{"text":"Long island ice tea was weak bar tender was rude and tv s too small. Cook did good job w wings."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband last night for a nightcap after the Bruno Mars concert.  We initially went inside to find a waiter to see if we would be able to sit outside.  However, there was no one around.  After walking around and back and forth for what seemed like forever, we finally saw a waitress. My husband went up to her and told her that we would be sitting outside and would like menus.  She said ok.  We went and sat outside for about ten minutes with no sign of the waitress coming out to check on us or take our orders.  My husband and I are already not huge fans of Bar Louie because their prices are pretty high and the overall atmosphere just seems \"bougie\". (I've been to the Westlake location in the past). My husband and I ended up going to Ohio City for a night cap.  I don't think I'd ever go back to a Bar Louie location again."}
{"text":"We were stumbling around Station Square before the happy hour rush and needed a little something to calm the nerves. Red Star seemed to fit the bill as it had cocktails, and a nice patio overlooking one of the main plazas. We sat on the patio for a really long time with no acknowledgment from the staff, so I walked up to the bar to order, and even that took a painfully long time. The drinks were good, quite generous with the good stuff, so can't complain too much. The interior had a good vibe, with plenty of TV's, a pool table, and such, and as we left, they were setting up a burger & beer station in front of the restaurant for the Friday night Station Square crowd. Overall, I'd be wary about stopping in during the day if you're in a hurry, but there are worse places to spend the afternoon."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. We ordered our first drink and appetizer, it took about 20 minutes to get that. We then ordered  a second drink, 2 beers, that took another 20 minutes. When we got those drinks we ordered our food and 2 drinks to go with dinner. After sitting there for about 45 minutes for our food, we told the server to cancel our order. The manager didn't even come speak to us to find out why we were cancelling the order. We will never go back! Since, you are making me select a star it will be 1, but it should be 0!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour and the staff is super friendly. I love the variety of martinis they offer."}
{"text":"Good food - great drinks and bartended(go Ned!!) bruschetta great- pasta good- voodoo sauce awesome-"}
{"text":"Like other reviews it's a guessing game regarding waiting for a table or finding ones own seating. My party waited for some assistance; no one ever came.  So we grabbed our own table, which was filthy.  My wife and I order a whiskey sour. Very disgusting concoction of sweet pink juice mixed in with a weak tasting whiskey. On with the appetizer. The chips trio consisted of stale chips, and cheese/salsa/guacamole from a jar. On with the food. We ordered fish and chips. Not sure what type of fish it was since the menu didn't list it. Aside from the thick and greasy coating the fish was good however the fries were barely warm. Only one other person in my party received their food while two others waited and waited and waited for theirs. Finally we asked our server about the missing food. The expression on his face was of  \"what, you other people ordered food too\". Then he rushed off to the kitchen in search of it. Finally he came back with the missing dishes. If this was a a restaurant that just opened for business I could understand the lack of confusion that took place that night, but really not the case here.  Dear Manager: at least spend a few extra bucks for a sign that says \"Seat Yourself \".  I won't be going back to this place."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate when I love a places food but the service is so poor that it affects 1) how I feel about the restaurant and 2) the frequency of my visits. So let's start with the pros:  -upper scale bar food (pretzals with sweet dipping butter, amaaaazing calamari) -indoor/outdoor seating with heaters -seat yourself  and now the cons:  -looooong wait for food/drinks -seat yourself (also a con as well as a pro because sometimes waiters don't notice you) -some outdoor seats aren't heated well enough by the heaters   In the times we have went we have waited a massive amount of time for one appetizer, another time we waited at least 20 minutes for a drink and for them to even take our food order. The outside seats can be great or terribly cold depending on where the table is placed and the wind. That hasn't knocked down stars for me, it was simply the wait time. We go to Westgate all the time and food/bar hop and the other restaurants do not have that problem with under staffing. The very last time we went and we had told the waitress that 20 minutes was rather long to wait for ONE drink, she said it was a bartender in training. I feel like Saturday night at peak time would be when they would have a \"seasoned\" bartender and the training bartender \"assisting\" not RUNNING the bar but maybe the waitress was just making an excuse. Either way we will be back because of the awesome food but I've come to expect a massive wait for service."}
{"text":"So we went on a Sunday afternoon after a movie and the place was pretty empty maybe about 4 tables seated. I've  got to say I was not overly impressed. the service was slow and all the burgers were overcooked. I mean if you're going to ask somebody how they want their burger cooked by all means it should come that way. The bill came it was $125 for five of us for lunch. The rest of the food was kind of okay . Probably won't go go back . a bit overpriced for the quality that you're getting."}
{"text":"Good place but food is inconsistent. One time I had a turkey burger and it was great, 2 weeks later I ordered the same thing but it was over salted and dry."}
{"text":"It was our first time at Bar Louie and we had an AMAZING experience. We ordered lots of delicious, beautiful food that tasted incredible. My boyfriend and I dine out frequently and we were extremely impressed with our bartender, Brooke Tate. She greeted us with a big smile and was extremely knowledgeable with the menu. All of her recommendations for food and alcohol were spot on. Her personality radiated the room and she was absolutely delightful. We were so impressed by her that because of her service we will be coming back all the time! Great great service and we can't wait to come back for more. Thanks Brooke!!"}
{"text":"Went to happy hour with a friend and like always the drinks and food were great. But what keeps me coming back is the STELLAR costumer service. Leigh and Brandy are both great and go above and beyond to make everyone feel comfortable and relaxed after a hard day's work. I definitely recommend this specific Bar Louie to all my friends and peers"}
{"text":"Server was great, but the kitchen let her down this time. When she noticed our tater tots were completely cooked to bricks that disintegrated into powder when you picked them up, she rushed another order for us that came out cold. So can't blame her. The rest of the food was good, the sesame tuna sandwich had a nice pesto sauce I think. Wife liked her veggie wrap with balsamic. We also had a Caesar salad which was very good except for the croutons. I expect restaurant croutons to be day old bread, but at least toast them. Not just stale hunks of yesterday's rolls on a plate. Funny the two easiest elements of our meal provided the biggest challenge."}
{"text":"I always appreciate when a shopping center has a bar nearby. That way my wife can shop in peace without my meddling. And I have a place to relax. Bar Louie is that place in Legacy Village. Nice wood and tile decor, decent drink selection, friendly staff, and tasty appetizers. I like the Thai Chicken flatbread. We might actually head up there again today."}
{"text":"This location rocks! A huge shout out to Phillip  (server) and Rachel (hostess) they are the bomb diggity! They went out the way to make our experience amazing! Food is great, but service is incredible! Thank you Bar Louis Westgate! Woo hoo!"}
{"text":"As with any bar louie i've been to.....great drinks, good food selection, great service. Perfect location in the wh district, you can choose to park yourself or valet for 7.00.  The tuna is always perfect here."}
{"text":"It's not often that my teenager, Muff, questions me about leaving a tip.  However, during a recent visit to Bar Louie she actually asked me why I left a tip because the service was horrible.  And I mean horrible.  So bad that it took away from the food.  Let me start by saying that my daughter and I were at Station Square for a charity event and we were starving by the end of the event.  Being that it was Light Up Night, a lot of the restaurants were pretty packed.  We chose Bar Louie because we could help ourselves to a table immediately and the menu seemed agreeable to us. (I personally had never been to this location and only had the Waterfront location to go on.  Big mistake!)   First we had one server, who said that they would be right back with our drink orders, then our water (without the lemon that we asked for) was slapped down on our table by another server.  This new server, unfortunately, ended up being our server for the evening.   Oh joy!  To prepare for eating, both my daughter and I visited the restroom.  The water never approached anything similar to warm and the sink faucets actually had rust. (I couldn't believe that employees were asked to please wash their hands before leaving the restroom with that water temperature and using those sinks!  I'm glad that I had cleaner in my purse!)  We asked about menu options and then ordered the traditional Szechwan wings, Bavarian Pretzel Sticks, a side of mac & cheese and a side salad.  To be truthful, the wings and side salad were excellent.  The pretzel sticks and mac & cheese were just so-so.  But here's the kicker, our server was MIA during most of our meal and when we asked for plates so that we could split our food, the server grabbed empty plates from a display and then tossed them on our table.  When I say, tossed, I mean tossed.  After asking for our check, the server went MIA again and when they FINALLY came back, they tossed our check on the table without stopping to see how our meal was.  I haven't had service that bad in God knows how long.  I realize that it was a busy night but come on man, that service was horrible!  And the manager who walks around asking if everything is okay didn't even pause to get an answer.  Hence the question from my daughter asking why I gave a tip.  Common decency on my end, but I really shouldn't have.  It was that bad!"}
{"text":"So, I was went to this palce for my fiancee's job's Christmas party, and I have to say this place was a MAJOR disappointment! Firstly, I ordered a Newcastle Brown Ale, it tasted watered down. Then the wait felt like it was forever(about 35 minutes)  to recieve our food(to give them the botd they were busy). One person at the table was ordered a burger well done, it came back pink and almost bloody. One server served a maceroni dish she didn't order and the server realized that she was at the wrong table. When my fiance and I finally recieved our food her burger that she ordered was well done  (charred around the outside). Then the bill for the crappy meal was over priced and the server (who wasnt good) recieved 18% gratutity because it was a party.  Meh food, crappy service, overpriced."}
{"text":"Came here for a drink and food. Didn't know it but Thursday is trivia night.. Ended up being pretty fun. Got a beer on happy hour 4-7 I believe, then the bulleit burger with fries, medium.   The waitress was super friendly and even extended happy hour for us! 4 stars for her.  The burger was decent. For how good it looked and sounded on the menu, it was a bit disappointing. It was over cooked which maybe is where it went wrong. The fries were pretty typical and good. 3 stars for the food.  Was with a group and a bunch of people got burgers or sandwiches with tots. In a funny moment, one of the plates had about half the amount of tots as the others. Needless to say, that person was a bit sad.  Overall pretty standard chain bar food but really nice staff."}
{"text":"Disappointed, yet enlightened!  My husband and I met for lunch here.  We were one of three other couples seated.  We waited over 30 minutes for our food.  The fish was over cooked for the sandwich and the veggies in the veggie wrap tasted awful.  Needless to say we couldn't finish our lunch due to the poor outcome of the food.   While we were waiting for our food I observed the female bar tender preparing what I assume was mixed drinks for later in the day.  She consistently touched her face and hair, during her preparation.   For me, this is good to know how behind the scenes occur.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Went there for first time, and wanted outside seating. The table was so dirty , looked like it had not been cleaned for awhile, so much dust on it. We left ."}
{"text":"I had a great time here with friends! Miranda was my server and she was very nice and offered plenty of great suggestions! I plan on going back again in the future to try some other things as well :)"}
{"text":"I threw my husband a surprise birthday party here in the area of the restaurant with the couches/chairs. It is a pretty big space and super easy to lounge in. Everyone really enjoyed the fact that we could walk around in lounge setting. Brittany (maybe that was her name) help me set-up everything for the party in advance and she was super sweet. They also let you bring in your own decorations/cake.   The food was subpar which explains the 3/5 rating. The spinach dip might as well have been melted cheese because it didn't taste like anything and the nachos ugh (Bobby from A Goofy Movie would have been very disappointed in the lack of chedda). Our server was really nice but she seemed confused the whole time and at times a different server would bring us a drink that someone ordered and she would bring the same drink so there appeared to be some communication breakdowns.   All in all- they have half off aps until 7 pm for happy hour so it definitely is a good place to host a party/event but the food just wasn't good."}
{"text":"As far as chain restaurants go, Bar Louie is ok. I really like their appetizers and their salads, but I don't care for their burgers or pastas. Their drinks are ok. They're normal corporate restaurant drinks...i.e., Applebees.  Service is hit or miss. Last time I went, I had just fine service. The time before that was also just fine. Sometimes the server is a little spazzy and seems new or doesn't know wtf he's talking about. (Once, I went and ordered red zinfandel and he brought me white zinfandel and argued with me that it was red zinfandel. I had to explain to him that white zinfandel can be confusing because it is, in fact, pink. I still don't think he believed me. It would've been amusing if it weren't for the fact that it was actually annoying).   Things I like: calamari, pretzel sticks, wedge salad, some of the sandwiches. Things I dislike: frozen burgers they sell for $1.  Great to stop in right before a movie at Loews, though! :-)"}
{"text":"Perfectly priced, HUGE bar, and fun for both family and a night out! Finally a decent spot to eat in the University area that isn't the same old commercial like environment! !"}
{"text":"Waited and waited for our food.  50 minutes for 2 burgers.  Kitchen was horribly sloe."}
{"text":"3 stars hits it on the head.  Service is good at the bar, but can be slow on the patio. They seem to take quite a while to notice you at first especially if its busy.  Food is exactly what Yelp says for 3 stars... \"A-OK\" but nothing to go out of your way for. It's pretty standard & unimaginative fare; they don't seem to have any items that really jump out at you. I've done burgers, various apps & one of the cake-in-a-jar desserts. The bruschetta is HUGE, in a giant martini glass, and probably the only thing I would really be excited to order.  The prices though, are absurd. Seriously. Once I remember that, is when I start to ask the suggesting friend \"Ehhhh can we go somewhere else?\"  All the apps run $10+. The drinks are even worse. Nothing good or 'specialty' is on HH pricing.  Mules, martinis, other cocktails are in the $10 range; it's insane. The liquor pours are definitely on the skimpy side. Could barely taste anything in my drink yesterday, and the Fireball shots were about 3/4 of an oz. instead of a full 1 oz.  If they get another fun bar in Tempe Marketplace (that isn't primarily geared towards being a restaurant like everything else), Louie will be knocked off the list, but until then it's acceptable."}
{"text":"This place should be ashamed of themselves! Waited 15min for someone to take my order, writing this while waiting! Where are the wait staff? Finally someone comes up to me and I'm too ticked to give this place my business... Got dressed up with my date and had my whole menu planned out. Disappointed. I saw 3 waitresses come next to me but they were too busy having their friends over like chatty Kathys. It's dead and I wanna give you my money but the 20 waitresses (not literally) won't do their jobs! No thank you."}
{"text":"Typically up scale bar where the cheapest drink is $7 and has  really nice interior. Service was pretty good (which is why they are getting 3 stars instead of 2) and had no issue splitting up the tab in our group of 10. They had $1 burgers but the trick was that if you wanted cheese, onions, ketchup, mustard, etc it was $0.50 for each. Plus the burgers were overcooked but who cares i was drunk and it was only a dollar."}
{"text":"Bar Louie is a poor option in Crocker Park. Want Applebees level food at a higher price? Ok, check out Bar Louie. Otherwise, skip it and go to one of the other chain options (with better food). Went here for lunch today, a Monday, with my boss.   I haven't been to a Bar Louie since a random drinking binge barcrawl in 2005 as a grad student at Illinois - and I probably should have kept up that streak.  Pros: - Service was fine. Nothing special, but OK. - The dining room is nice. Great garage doors that open up in the summer and probably make it a good place for a happy hour beer or two.   Cons: - The food was passable, but at $10+ for a burger and side, I expect more than a pre-formed frozen patty and some basic toppings. - My side, black beans and rice, had obviously been sitting around for a couple days. After raising the issue to the server, she took it and subbed a side salad, but I could tell the rice was dried out and reheated at a glance. Should have never even been served. - The side salad was a joke. It was a handful of cruddy lettuce, a few tomato bits, and a few cucumber bits. Not fresh, not made up - just thrown together haphazardly.  Overall, it's a subpar restaurant with bleh food at high prices. Check out somewhere different and save some cash."}
{"text":"one of my favorite places to go in pittsburgh with friends. good place to chill, eat, drink and watch the game, and maybe some pool afterwards. the food is not bad, they have pretty good deals for those who are on a budget. \"dollar burger night\" where you build your own burger is fun, but the patties can be dry sometimes, so remember to get them sauced. iceberg wedge salad is a good salad to have, the wings arent as good as you would like, i had tried the spicy killer ones and didnt even have to drink water. but overall its a nice place to go because it's cleaner than most bars you will go and it serves better food than other places as well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for lunch last Friday. We walked in and was greeted by the bartender. She said we could sit anywhere. We chose to sit at a high top table near the bar. Our server dropped off some waters and told us she would be back in a few minutes. They seemed to be a little short staffed,but it was nice to see great team work. Our server apologized for the wait and took our order. We ordered a Blue Moon, Dos Equis for my boyfriend, buffalo chicken flatbread, and salmon sliders without bacon because my boyfriend doesn't eat bacon. Our food came out and everything looked delicious. I started to eat the sliders and realized there was bacon in it. I believe it was either the head chef or restaurant manager who came and asked us how the food was. We mentioned the mistake about the bacon and he apologized and offered to make a new order. However, I eat bacon so we told them it was alright. Once we got the bill we noticed they took the sliders off the bill which was very nice of them. Their customer service was great and the food was tasty as well. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This is a regular hangout for us and we are very comfortable eating at the bar and watching sports.  My husband generally has the salmon sliders, which are consistently great.  I've been having the Voodoo Chicken lately and really like it...so much flavor!  I was disappointed last night...ordered my usual Jack and Diet and it was as if there was no liquor in it at all.  I let the bartender know.  He gave me some type of excuse and made me another one that was perfect.  This will continue to be our Friday night after work \"place\"."}
{"text":"Pretty good bar food.  Very overpriced. The atmosphere was dark and dingy looking.  It is ok to go and have an appetizer or a quick drink, but that's pretty much it. Would probably go back if I wanted something quick."}
{"text":"If Fridays and Applebee's had a mature older sister Bar Louie would be it. You come here to watch sports,  pretend to watch sports,  or just BS and catch up with your friends. It's a super casual spot in a nice location. Rather it's after shopping or after work Bar Louie has a decent crowd. Sometimes it gets super crowded if there's a game or if it's a nice day and it's fine. The service here depends on how busy it is. Sometimes it's been quick and sometimes you're all \"Where's my drink?\"  I enjoy their cocktails and the fact that they have a different special for every day of the week. But please don't get fooled. These specials seem cheap until you realize their burger special makes you pay for every topping and their bottomless mimosas aren't really bottomless. After you get over the real price of the specials and you get your yummy dessert flavored beverage everything is okay."}
{"text":"Im giving this a 2 star mostly because of the food. We made reservations for 8 and the person on the phone handling reservations was very polite. When we arrived out table was ready. We ordered cocktails and we were smooth sailing. Food. Uh-ohhhhh. One friend ordered the chopped salad. The menu made it sound like a feast! It arrived looking like someone spilled a bag of chopped iceberg lettuce with shredded carrots on a plate. No avocados, half of the listed items missing, 3 garbanzo beans....blech! Pear & bleu salad came to another guest missing bleu.... Half of the orders were incomplete or waitress asked same questions repeatedly and still screwed up orders.  Not a great meal. Not great service."}
{"text":"Bar Louise is a great place for large groups and late night eats. The vibe was chill on Friday with a lovely waitress!! Great service and reasonable prices for quality ingredients. My meal wasn't life changing so just not 5 stars but over all a great place to hang. I would go back when in the area.  The tater tots were awesome and the salmon Sliders were delicious!"}
{"text":"A buddy of mine and myself were in from out of town to see a football game and stopped by on a Friday around happy hour time. The bar is nice inside but the crowd was pretty dull... We sat at the bar and the bartenders were very friendly but again not a lot of \"energy\" for a Friday happy hour.  We grabbed an appetizer as they have half priced specials and that was fine.  After seeing the reviews and some of the plates of food come out we decided to skip the burgers and just have a couple of drinks.  Overall it's a nice looking place but I was looking for a \"fun\" spot on a Friday and this didn't seem to have it."}
{"text":"I'm slightly surprised that I've never been here because their specials are pretty fantastic. We were heading to go see a movie and needed a quick bite and a drink to fill up some time. After a quick check online we decided to Bar Louie was the place to go. The service was fast and friendly. And I really appreciated the fact that when we told our waitress that we had a movie to go to she put a little bit of a rush on our order. She made sure that we got out on time and that I'm grateful for. I hate sometimes when you go to a restaurant and you say I have to be out or do you think that this will be done in a certain time and they say yes and it's not at all the case. So this type of service really puts me in a great mood.  We ordered the special of a glass of wine because they were I believe for $4.50 each, which you really cannot beat. I went with a Moscato and it was great. My friend with the Cab and it was also pretty good too.  We order the Thai chicken flatbread and an order of boneless wings. They both came out fairly quickly and were pretty tasty.  The Thai chicken flatbread had a pretty good sauce over it and I would say it would be a solid three and a half. I think that it would be overwhelming to eat an entire flatbread with that flavor combination but between the two of us it was pretty good.  The boneless wings were pretty standard. Deep-fried and crunchy. They had a lot of sauce on them which I liked and enough vegetables to share between the two of us. I would probably order this again.  If you're looking for some good specials and Quick Service before a movie I would suggest coming to Bar Louie. Sit at the bar and tell them your movie time. They for sure they will get you out in time for your movie, and with your belly full."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 6, as soon as we sat down the waiter said they were out of 4 items. Didn't take too long to get the drinks but forever to get the food and it was not packed at all. Our waiter brought us some ranch and his finger was knuckle deep in one of the ranches. Then he got an attitude when I asked what was taking so long. The bartender behind us was cussing up a storm while making a drink. The waiter also kept 90 cents from one of the groups tabs. I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, a Monday , at about 1:00. Place totally empty....honestly we were the only customers. Server very friendly and got us drinks in a very timely fashion. Then we ordered....me, lettuce wrap app...hubby, burger with egg on top. Seriously took 1/2 hour for food to come out. Burger bun was stale and egg was dried out.  Hubby did not trust burger to eat with stale bun. Mine (pic attached) just looked like a bowl of, well, poo. Add to that that lettuce was limp, oy vey. Did not eat, and offered to pay for hubbies Diet Coke, but server comped this. Not servers fault, but seriously kitchen....there was literally no one else there."}
{"text":"Great night spot to meet friends and hangout to hear live music.   Me and about a dozen of my friends met there on September 30th to support The Kevin Jones Experience Band. ..and he did not disappoint. His selection of musical treats were phenomenal.    The place is enormous but the built in sound system allows for enjoyment of the music wherever you're sitting.  The staff were friendly, tastefully attentive and with just a little glitch of not offering water when guest are seated,  they made up for it with good ticket times and an engaging demeanor.    Definitely on my list of new hangouts. ..big thumbs up Bar Louie. ...Ya'll rock!!!!"}
{"text":"My experience there on a Sunday during brunch/lunch hours left me less than impressed, but not truly disappointed.  It seems a lot of the reviews cite lapses in service. We didn't experience that. Service was, well, serviceable, but it did seem our server was the only one on our side of the restaurant.  My chilaquile nachos promised pulled pork, but I was really only able to dig out about 4-5 forkfuls from the mound of chips and RAW jalape√±os. Come to think of it, most of the other ingredients, besides the fried eggs on top, were kind of hard to find. It could have benefited from a traditional enchilada sauce for some moisture. I left most of the chips on the plate as they were untouched by any of the toppings.   Mom's burger was solid and made me wish I lived closer so I could take advantage of the $5 Tuesday burger special I read about in other reviews.  Bloody Mary was pretty solid with a buffet of ingredients as a garnish. I had one of their three IPA's on tap. Their brunch menu seemed pretty anemic with mostly Bennies and omelettes. The Tuesday burger special seems like a killer deal and, if it's Tuesday and I'm in the area, I'll be sure to stop in. Besides that, I won't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years the food is good but the service sucks today was my last time if I wanted to be treated like shit I would stay home"}
{"text":"I hate bashing on companies but honestly this was the worst food I've ever had. I would've enjoyed Tyson chicken nuggets over there wings and there flat bread thing they have is literally repulsive  like everything was dry af and not worth it"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, good food, good drinks. Went on a weekday around 5:00. There was no hostess, but a sign that said to seat yourself. There was ample seating, so that wasn't a problem. However no waiter came out until I asked a bartender to send someone. After that, there were no problems. Good service and food didn't take too long. Definitely would go back. FYI: Drinks are $10. It's not on the menu. Thought you may want to know. Chocolate martini is great!"}
{"text":"The bourbon burger and tots were really good and the our waiter was friendly! But there was about a 10 minute wait between one half of our table getting their food and the other, which was slightly awkward because we wanted to wait for them to eat but didn't want our food getting cold! Overall it as a pretty good experience!"}
{"text":"We've been these 3 times and we're never disappointed. The staff is friendly and attentive. Great place for drinks and eats before or after a game."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came for the martini specials on Wednesday, which were only $5.25, great deal. We sat in the 'seat yourself' bar area where our waitress was extremely kind and helpful. The dining area surround 3/4 of the bar, making it a hot spot to watch games.  They provide a back area where one could have a private party at, which I would recommend because the food and drinks are of high quality for a bar/restaurant.  For the martinis, I had the Effin good (cucumber infused) and the Pom Peche (pomegranate) and both were delicious, may I also add filled to the brim. CUH-CHING! For my meal, I had the basic Caesar salad with shrimp and lemon as my dressing, which I literally left nothing but a few morsels of cheese left over, it was that delicious. If only I had a picture for that sight. My girlfriends had a BBQ salad, which she noted as being average and the burger was slightly overdone, but not too big of an issue.  So come in, drab a drink, sit back and relax at this excellent corner restaurant and bar on the corner of St. Claire and West 6. The staff is attentive, whether is is your server or not, someone is always ready with a smile and a \"what can I do to help\" attitude. Cheers to Louie!"}
{"text":"Love this place! You can seat yourself. It is a bar setting obviously so it is loud. Their mac and cheese is awesome. This is the only thing I have tried there because it is so amazing. Their drinks so not disappoint. This is one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Went with a friend for 1/2 price apps and $3.25 drafts for their happy hour. They actually have a cider (yay!) and on tap! We had Amanda as our server and she was awesome! Definitely recommend for a casual happy hour meet up."}
{"text":"Nice decore and atmosphere. Not many quiet spaces buy that is to be expected in this simi-upper level sports bar. My date told me the fish tacos had no taste. Seems like a good place to hang out."}
{"text":"The service is okay, but the drinks are way over priced. $11.25 for tanquery gimlet. $10 for a Mai tai, $5.25 for a kilt lifter. One round set us back $50"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and rather humble, especially for a chain restaurant. The service is always friendly, even if they are busy. I enjoy taking clients out for drinks there because of the enjoyable bartenders and wide array of drinks on their menu. I highly recommend their chicken sliders and you have to try their tempura shrimp.   Be sure to make a reservation because they can get busy too!"}
{"text":"I'm convinced I'm not using the search function correctly because I'm shocked this place isn't on Yelp yet!!!  I love Town Square.. I really do. So many fun spots to have a drink or shop.. or catch a movie.. etc. I love Yardhouse and Blue Martini, but they get so freaking packed! When I go out I'm usually not looking for a \"scene\". I'm looking for more of a place to relax.. have a drink.. and enjoy the company of the people I'm with. If you're looking for something similar Bar Louie might be your spot!  We escaped the insane mobs at Blue Martini and stopped by Bar Louie to check out their free \"luigi\" (roast beef sandwich) promo. We barely made the 5-7 PM happy hour and were able to try some half price martinis and appetizers.   The downside of the happy hour is (and why I'm taking away a star!) that it doesn't include their awesome sounding \"specialty cocktails\". The promo was something like 1/2 off all wine, beer, appetizers, and \"martinis\". I wanted a mojito.. damnit.. Anyways, the martinis were good, but honestly the selection of 8 martinis here doesn't compare to Blue Martini.   Food was good, but not amazing. We had the pretzels (YUM! But I'm a pretzel freak and really easy to please), loaded cheese fries (again they are freaking cheese fries.. how do you screw that up!), and the Luigi sandwiches. They were solid Roast Beef Sandwiches, but honestly I prefer the processed garbage at Arby's (ok, at least I'm honest!!). The french buns they were on were superb, so I'd like to try other sandwiches there in the future!  All in all a great spot to try if Yardhouse and Blue Martini are packed to the gills and you want to just get away and actually get a table somewhere instead of being packed in like sardines. I loved the chill, yet upscale, atmosphere.  PS - Tuesday is $1 burger night.. maybe someone can make it out there and check out how good these $1 burgers are!!"}
{"text":"Great establishment! Awesome food and friendly service, wonderful atmosphere will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Crossing this one off my list of places to go to again. Visited for lunch and had a terrible experience. I ordered the Blackberry, Orange and Brie salad and received a Raspberry, Orange and Brie salad instead. When I told the server that I the fruit was wrong, he just stared at me and said \"uhhhhhhhhhh yeaaaa, I'll tell the cook. Hopefully he won't punch me in the face.\" Well he never told the cook and never fixed my salad.   The server was very unprofessional with his response and failure to fix the problem. The salad was also pretty welted and the portion was extremely small for a $14 salad. The person I was with ordered the Chop Chop salad and her salad was about 3 times bigger than mine.   Overall, I don't recommend this place, very unprofessional. There are plenty of other places downtown to choose from."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Crocker park. I wish they would open more places like this. Just chill drinks on a patio or a place with great decor.   Their drinks are great, especially on Wednesday for Martinis. Every meal I've had here has been amazing. I highly recommend it for a casual night out on a patio or inside."}
{"text":"The service is horrible. The bartender ignores you. Why would you spend your money in a place that clearly does not care about their patrons."}
{"text":"My first time here with a large group this week! Alyssa was phenomenal! Wonderful attention to every need and quick to ensure all was right! A new personal favorite!!!"}
{"text":"The food was not bad at all, but the service could be a bit better, was not welcomed very warmly, just was asked if we found something to eat yet and we're ready to order...the rat pack martini was not the greatest but did exchange for something else. Nearing the end of dinner the waitress became more polite and friendly which was a complete turn around. I will most likely visit in the future!"}
{"text":"Happy hour for the win! No frills, just good, convenient American food. I was surprised at how quickly and hot my food came. It's not often that a meal is delivered correct before the server can bring out the plates and silverware.   I came in around 5:30 on just as the bar was beginning to liven up. With almost every drink under $8 and about 10 menu items ranging from $4-$8, there's something for everyone. I ordered the calamari that was refreshingly fresh and I don't think I'd had better tomato sauce. My cheese quesadilla could feed two and rang in at a thrifty $4.   I have no complaints for Bar Louie. I had an awesome experience, I'll be coming back soon. Maybe tomorrow for $1 Burger Tuesdays!!"}
{"text":"Great location, nice atmosphere, but i did not enjoy my meal. I had the drunken fish and chips. The fish was fried a bit hard and was greasy. I did like the fries though. I don't think I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Good selection of food. Ordered the beef brisket sliders they were delicious. Service was good, friendly and prompt. Good crowd for a Friday lunch."}
{"text":"Charged me 12.50 for a red bull vodka on happy hour, no warning... What u think this is time square? Check yourself..."}
{"text":"oh my god this place is great. the food is amazing and the drink selection in great. best bloody mary i have had"}
{"text":"love coming here. service is always amazing and the food it great everytime. and the decor and all the TV's are amazing too."}
{"text":"I really like Bar Louie, but I have to say that this was one of the worst visits. I brought friends--seven of them--who'd never been to a Bar Louie before. I'd bragged about how good the food was. And sadly, this was the first Bar Louie that didn't meet the expectations I'd come to expect. The chicken nachos were literally half the size of other Bar Louie restaurants. And the service was horrible. We had to ask for everything twice, and several things we requested never arrived.   I'll probably give this location one more shot, and I'll definitely continue eating at other Bar Louie restaurants."}
{"text":"I always come here when I can't make up my mind or cheesecake factory is crowded and they never disappoint. Food comes out super fast and hot...salmon slider are good!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here, from healthy crisp salads to bacon and cheese covered loaded tots, the food here is GREAT bar food. Food here is QUALITY AND QUANTITY. Great foods to go with wines and beers, by the way, if you have a late group you can order cocktails by the pitcher. YAS!  My favorite salad has to be the Blue Cheese and Pear Salad, great pairings of pear and blue cheese and walnuts and cranberries. Another favorite item on the menu of mine is The Fried Louie burger, a cheeseburger with a fried egg!  They definitely have great happy hours, especially on Tuesday, 5pm-close, you can grab a burger and either tots or fries, for only $5.00! That's a deal you can't miss out on.  The only downfall and the only reason why I docked two stars is because I've been here so many times, and every time, the service here disappoints me in some way. I understand that it is a place where you seat yourself, but every single time I come here, I have to wave down a waiter to take out order after waiting about 10-15 mins. I'm very understanding when the say \"sorry about the wait\" but 3-4 times out of 5 that I've been? That's a bit much, and it's usually not even that busy when I come by. Even after ordering, service is so slow. Every time something is needed, it's given to my table when it's not needed anymore or when we've already finished our food. It'd be so much more enjoyable if the staff was more quick and attentive to the customer.  Eh, at least the food is good though, I'll be back for that, not the service."}
{"text":"I love coming here, they always are the best service I've seen anywhere. They are the bar to go to for any occasion. I wouldn't pick any other bar if I had the choice. Every employee does their best and makes sure you have the best experience. And Taylor Pursley is an amazing bartender and en even more amazing person she takes care of business and also makes the experience worth it. She definitely belongs at Bar Louie and is surpassing the expectations."}
{"text":"Tim did a great the burgers are great come check out Tim ( waiter) Tuesday 5 specialty burgers with fries love it"}
{"text":"Stopped by for happy hour on a Friday night, place was super packed but finally found a spot at the bar. Fairly quick service. We tried two different flatbreads, which were decent. Nothing great but not bad either."}
{"text":"We paid $20 for two beers. This place is a complete rip off.  You know beer is $10 in the stadium, it should not be in the bars.  Louie can kiss my ass."}
{"text":"Busy place before a hockey game. So-so service... Lousy dirty martini that took 10 min. as opposed to hubby's draft beer which took seconds. Martini tasted like pure olive juice. Appetizer and dinner both were super slow to arrive and were cold ... except for the fries which were lukewarm. And omg... the blowers above the bar (garage door) window area drown out all possible conversations unless yelling is the new conversational appropriate decibel. Not planning to ever return."}
{"text":"I've been here three times in the past month - not by choice.  Over all of my visits, I ordered the chicken quesadilla twice, chicken nachos, and spinach and artichoke dip.  The chicken quesadilla was good the first time (except the guacamole is like no guacamole I've ever seen - whole chunk of avocado, really dark green, really not good), but the third visit, it was burnt and dry.  The chicken nachos come with a ton of toppings (incl the weird guac), but somehow still have no taste.  The dip also had very little taste, and the chips were stale.  The third visit was at 2 PM on a weekday, but they had the \"Event Menu\" on the table.  The Event Menu is really limiting, so I asked the waitress, \"Is this the menu for today?\"  and she said yes, but then huffily said, \"Do you want a regular menu?\"  You either offer the full menu, or you don't.  We were the only people in there, and I feel like they just wanted to stick with the smaller menu.  The menu she brought me was sticky, with soda spilled on it.  Like, the pages were stuck together, and the first two pages actually ripped when I tried to turn the page. I resorted to the Event Menu because I didn't want to touch that thing any longer.  The kids' meals say that they come with a dessert.  The first visit, they brought it right out.  The second time, I had to request it, and the waiter seemed confused.  The third visit, the waitress brought out the check and never mentioned it, and I just wanted to leave.    Cost for me and two kids was about $50 each time.  WAY overpriced.  Never again."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends for dinner as it's right next to the hotel that im staying.  It's Tuesday night and they had $1 burger night.  The menu has lots of option which i like.  The food was good, however the service was extremely slow even it was not that busy and we got there around 6pm.  Our waiter took forever to take our orders, at the end we had to ask other server for our bills so we can pay.  We made sure we paid cash so we did not have to take a chance to wait there any longer.  I give 3 stars for the food but would not want to come back as we dont want to get stuck there even we will get stay in this area for another 4 days.  I'd rather use my time to walk around then get stuck there just wait around."}
{"text":"Skylar was a wonderful server and I truly enjoyed my time at Bar Louie solely because of the service I received from Skylar. I will definitely be back again just to see him!"}
{"text":"Nice venue,  good food, great beer, awful service.  Staying at the Sheraton here I've patronized Bar Louie a dozen times recently and they screw up the order in some fashion every single time, without exception."}
{"text":"Great place for a burger and a drink. The staff seems to be a little annoyed tonight. Ordered a pitcher of Hurricane and the server did not even pour the first round. She brought us dirty glasses also. Food was good though."}
{"text":"Excellent! Mellisa was a 10/10. A smile and great service! Thank you for employing awesomeness! We'll be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 8 and 5 of those 8 were in from out of town. This was their first time in downtown Cleveland and their experience at Bar Louie was terrible. There were only two tables with people so we expected quick service. The waiter took 15mins to come to the table for our drink order. He then forgot to bring the citrus fruit our guest asked for. After waiting for a half and hour, three of our meals never showed up and two dishes had undercooked salmon. It then took another twenty minutes for our food to come and by that time I spoke with someone and told them my guests had a flight to catch and the food needed to be boxed. After being informed that one of us were allergic to tomatoes there were still tomatoes on the sliders that were brought back out. We will NEVER be returning to the downtown Cleveland Bar Louie."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has a 3 star rating....? The burgers are awesome! The buffalo blue and southwest are my top picks. Service isn't the greatest, but David our server was polite and checked on us just enough times, we will be back on a Tuesday for 5 dollar burgers"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on NYE to have a few drinks and watch OSU get smoked by Clemson. Our server was EXCELLENT!!! he was always there when our drinks were getting low. Prices a little steap for double Titos and tonic but still had a great time"}
{"text":"Visited the west gate establishment I was highly impressed with the Manger and bar staff. They were all working hard including management especially in what seemed to be a high pressure situation with wall to wall people. I felt like I was the only person their, even though I was in a sea of people standing waiting I eventually met the Manger and I believe his name was Patrick or Rick or Patty I m not sure but that guy is awesome to be so friendly and accommodating in such a busy time. After having experience at other places in this area this place is far and above the rest my new spot while I am in the area"}
{"text":"Clara is an incredible bartender. Tonight we went in for martinis and burgers.. best Tuesday night ever!! So glad I chose to sit at the bar. Excellent service & bomb drinks. Make sure to sit @ the bar and ask for Clara!! :)"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, the first time the food was okay. Half of it came out cold and the spinach dip was just not good at all.  The one lady I was with wasn't crazy about her meal, the server was super nice and brought her another meal to go.   Tonight we came just for drinks. The bartender was so weird it was uncomfortable. A guy who was obviously training came up and asked him what a drink was and his reply was \"I hate that drink, I refuse to make it\". He then started making a drink with Titos, the bottle ran out and he finished making it with Grey Goose. He then scooped ice up with the glass, that is literally the first thing you learn not to do bartending.  The bar was not even busy, so use that excuse all you want, but it is never excusable.   Be prepared when you visit the establishment and maybe leave a low review, you will probably (like I did) get a message from an employee harassing you. Very professional.   Maybe I have too high of expectations, but I have no interest in ever coming back."}
{"text":"I gave them three because the martini I had was excellent but the food leaves a lot to be desired my food had Alfredo sauce on it but it was served over rice which is a terrible combination the atmosphere is wonderful it's beautiful. But they should reevaluate some of the menu choices combinations some just don't match up."}
{"text":"This place is located in Westgate, near the Cardinals stadium and Gila River Arena. The entrance is near the fountain and when you walk in, the bar is directly in front of you. It is a large restaurant with outdoor seating if you care to brave the heat this time of year.  We have been to Bar Louie a number of times and have been absolutely thrilled with the quality of the food and the service.   They have ten hamburger selections, including a Spiked Bulleit Bourbon Burger that you have to be 21 to eat.   I have had the Fried Louie, which has bacon, cheddar and eggs and served with fries or tots. The burger was beautifully cooked and the richness of the egg adds an awesome component.  The Louie Burger is a must for the Midwest folks, as it has grilled onion, Provolone and spicy giardiniera--a flavor explosion!  They are not just a burger place, but that is what draws me here.   The service has always been spot on and the place is clean. The ambiance is more toward the higher end of casual eateries, and costs a little more as well. With all the other things going on at Westgate, it is just fun to be here.  They are not perfect however. Their Happy Hour menu is unclear at best. They could really tighten that up.  Also, you need to be aware if there is an event happening at either of the arenas. All the restaurants in what I call Westgate proper (surrounding the fountain) serve reduced menus when there is something happening that will draw large crowds.  To end on a positive note: Tuesday they have $5 burgers from 5-close (except the spiked bourbon burger). Gotta love that!"}
{"text":"I have visited Bar Louie several times now. Nothing very special - the food is only ok. Was pretty shocked to get my check and see that my beers were $8 (!!!!) and on game days they only have an \"event menu\" which is very limited. I think the only reason this place gets customers is because of its location by the stadiums - it's convenient and that's about it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere for date night! We had the avocado fries for an app and they were delicious!! My salad was awesome and service was great! I had an orange mule and it was pretty good as well ! I will def be back :)"}
{"text":"Three of us stopped in for drinks around 1030 on a Friday night. The place wasn't busy at all. The service took an eternity. The drinks we expensive and subpar. Would not care to go again."}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday and the service was horrible. Our waiter was forgetful, slow, and inattentive . We had to keep asking for our drinks, refills, etc. it got to the point where we asked for our cheek and left."}
{"text":"Was there for Saturday dinner at 6pm and still had some seats opened.  We sat down right away.  You sat yourself and menu was at the table.   Very casual place, yet family place.   A little noisy so not for date nights.  A little bit sports bar like but not like Champs.  Food was great.  Had boneless chicken nuggets (el fuego).  Side salad was very good.  I had verde chicken pasta and my husband had cod skewers with shrimp fried rice - I had some and it was delicious.  Clean bathroom- very important."}
{"text":"The past two times I've had the pulled bbq pork sandwich with tots. Absolutely fantastic. Tasty and juicy as well as overall wonderful.  Priced fair and customer service has always been great. Great choice of brews. I'm a repeat customer."}
{"text":"While on a weeknight movie night with the better half and one of his friends, I hadn't eaten dinner, and they wanted a snack. Since we'd been to the Waterworks Burgatory just the night before, they made the decision to hit Bar Louie. I had been there once before for a 'dating dinner group', and at that event everything was a prefab menu, with three or four choices, and all inclusive, so it wasn't all that bad as a meal, but had it not been for the event, I never would have bought a dinner there.  Bar Louie is another one of those conveyor belt food over-atmosphered attempts at being a yupscale hang out chain...in a town that already has Shadyside.  The snackers ordered calamari and a spinach dip and chip, and I, who needed something more substantial, ordered a burger. Now that hipster burgers are the latest trend, they're all giving them funky names, so don't ask me to remember what name THIS burger with an egg, bacon, and cheese had. It sounded really good, and I ordered it medium rare, and asked them to well-fry the egg, which had been listed as over-easy, or sunny side up...both of which tell me the yolk is runny, and I already have mayo and mustard drippage to contend with as a result of my own tastes. I don't need a river of yellow running down my arm.  The waitress was lovely, as well as her waitress in training. No complaints about service at all.  The snackers enjoyed their calamari and chips and dip, though it did bring about a titter of ironic laughter when they reached the 'bottom' of the cone of calamari to discover the bottom inch and a half was actually shredded lettuce.  The burger, however...well...  First off, obviously frozen patty...doesn't matter HOW you order it, it will never maintain ANY level of pink or red...it will just be grey. There will be no juices to flow. It is an institutional frozen hockey puck burger. The egg was not completely cooked, and the first bite created a spurt of warm yellow egg yolk out of the side of the sandwich. The toppings were fine, and there was enough of it to drown out the flavorless puck-burger. The burger came with tater tots, and my better half said that there would be a TON of them, from his past experience. Well, apparently they cut that corner too. There were about ten small tots.   The cost of the burger was close to $11. For a frozen patty. And when I asked for a side of mayo and a dark mustard, they charged 25 cents for the mustard. A Diet Coke was $2.99. The cost of your basic fridge pack on sale at the big bird.  Now...what baffles me is...with one of THE most prime burger restaurants directly across the street...that charges about the same price BUT uses daily fresh ground beef, and comes in a variety of hipster-named concoctions, OR a build-your-own checklist to choose from that is chock full of prime ingredient choices...WHY would you serve such a low-end version of a burger for the same price? I would think they would make some attempt to at least rise to meet the level of the competition. And frankly, the Burgatory atmosphere is just as yupscale (albeit kitschy themed with halos and pitchforks), and not only more interesting, but with a much higher quality product for the price point.   Soooo...other than pleasant service and a highly polished yupscale atmosphere...what is the plus of Bar Louie? I don't eat either of those.  Beats the crap out of me...next movie night...Burgatory it is.  And hopefully a better movie too."}
{"text":"This is the only place I'll eat when I have a reason to go to Station Square.  I've tried the hummus, Caesar salad, and blue Louie burger.  All three were pretty good.  They have a large selection of drinks and the view is really nice of downtown and water.  If you want to be a tourist for a day I would suggest eating here.  I've never been at night but it looks like it may attract a more sports oriented clientele but the food isn't shabby.  Give it a try if you're in the area.  Everything else around here is pretty sub-par.  Please note: Parking is going to cost money unless you take public transport here.  It's about $4 if you're here less than 2 hours I believe."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm strickly reviewing their fish tacos.  I've been desperate for a good fish taco since I returned to Ohio.  These were just really disappointing cause they could have been good.  The blackened fish was good, the presentation was good, but everything else....meh.   Now, the key to a good fish taco is the slaw that its topped with and the sauce.  these tacos have neither.  They were also served with rice and refried beans which is unneccesary and weird.  I think so much consideration was put into what they looked like and not the taste.  Cause the blackening seasoning was great, it just needed a sweet element.  Even the lettuce, which they are served with, was UNDER the taco holder: so it was done for presentation not taste.  I like a good presentation as well as the next person, but if the taste isn't there, you've got nothing.  My friend had the fish and chips which were okay, but nothing special and we had the bavarian pretzels for an appetizer.  Again, they were good, but nothing special.  the presentation of everything was great.  Will I try again? Probably not."}
{"text":"I come here often when shopping or going to the movies in the Waterfront. The staff is always quick, friendly, and attentive.   On my last visit I ordered the fish tacos. I love trying them at various establishments and I can say the ones at Bar Louie were better than expected. They came out in a huge platter, fajita style. The fish was a bit too salty for my taste, but otherwise cooked well. The accompaniments made for the perfect taco, especially the corn tortillas. They were very flavorful.   My friend ordered the lettuce wraps and enjoyed them as well. The presentation on both dishes was great."}
{"text":"Have a appetizer they are delicious.  The beer selection is very good to. Good to try there sliders today."}
{"text":"I just wanted to say thank you to the staff at Bar Louie for being so nice and accommodating to our group! It was my husband's birthday and we decided to get a large group together to go out. It was also the Pens/Capitals Game 7 the night we planned to go out. I called another establishment (Rock Bottom) and asked for 11 seats reserved in the bar area to watch the game. They stated they don't do reservations in the bar area (even though I was basically bringing 11 people to drink and eat in excess of 4 hours) so I ended up calling Bar Louie. They were fantastic They reserved us a table and even had it right by a television so we could watch the game. The waitress did a great job serving 11 of us and keeping track of all the drinks and food we ordered (some of which was 1/2 off for happy hour for some of the time) I would definitely recommend this place for large groups and parties to anyone after the wonderful experience we had. Thanks to much to the staff and managers and bartenders at Bar Louie Waterfront~!"}
{"text":"I had really hoped this place would ROCK IT because I would love to have another favorite at Westgate.    We went last night after the Rattler vs Soul Arena Bowl championship because getting into Salt (the planned after party locale) was over an hour to get inside.  I liked the decor and truly thought this would be a fun place for dinner and drinks for a group of 10.  We were seated quickly - should have been a sign - and given three menus for 10 people.  After 20 minutes, we finally had somebody come to take a drink order. It wasn't that bad as we were all chatting and having a good time with each other so we didn't notice.   We each ordered a drink and being that we waited so long, we stated we were ready to order dinner as well.  The server explained she needed to do the drink order first and she would return.  Another 20 minutes later, she returned with our drinks.  Another 10 minutes later, she took our order.  Another 30 minutes later, we were having dinner.  Oh, haven't mentioned a drink reorder.  We didn't have one.  We asked for our checks and yep, true to form another 20 minutes later we got our checks and those of who paid cash got clean get aways but those with credit cards had another 20 minutes to wait.  The food was just ok and certainly not worth the high prices on the menu.  Sorry to say, we won't be back.  We will stick to Salt, Kabuki and Yard House at Westgate."}
{"text":"Bar Louie. Was at The Waterfront doing some shopping one night and it happened to be a Tuesday. My husband and I decided to stop in for Burger Night. It was seat yourself so we picked a high top table. Waited about 5 minutes and finally a waitress came over. She mistakenly told us it was Dollar Beer night but then corrected herself, and so we ordered our drinks- a Bud Light and a water.   Waited. 5 minutes go by. Waited. 10 minutes go by, and we start to look around and can't see our waitress anywhere. Waited. Finally almost 15 minutes go by and we got up and left. If it took that long to serve a draft beer and a water, then who knows how long it would take for food..."}
{"text":"This was the worst meal I have had in a while.  We ordered the bruschetta for an appetizer and it came in a giant martini glass.  The bread was soggy and the tomatoes tasted old.  I had the chicken quesadilla and it was very dry.  The salsa and guacamole were less than fresh.  It was inedible.  My husband had the boneless wings and there was so much sauce, it looked like soup on the plate.  This place was terrible.  I will never go back. Yuck!!"}
{"text":"I never leave reviews, but this place is amazing. I'm from out of town, and stumbled upon by accident after a concert festival. The food is incredible and the atmosphere is really mellow. I will definitely return when I stop back through town."}
{"text":"Where my brother and I tend to go to watch Steelers games.  Not the greatest menu or service (unless you're at the bar), but it fits our need perfectly - clean, good food, normal nice people, easy to get to."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings on this place. Came here one night and had a margarita, it was delicious. The second one I order tasted horrible. Cool place. Good menu. A lot of options."}
{"text":"I love coming here on their happy hour. $5 crispy calamari and $3 martini shots. They also have $5 burgers every Tuesday. Last time, the experience was even better with Julia (the awesome-personality girl with short red hair). Very attentive. Will be back soon to get some delicious food and visit Julia."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service is good Half price flatbreads till seven and it was great"}
{"text":"This place just misses with me. Two stars for the beer selection and the friendly bartender, but that's about it.  They do have outdoor seating which I wouldn't mind taking advAntage of at some point- but only for beers.  I haven't been impressed with their meals in the past, so we just went with nachos this time- the triple chip dip thing.  The dips themselves were just average. Salsa from a jar, same with the guacamole I assume, and the cheese was served with a \"skin\" on the top from sitting too long. The chips were extremely stale- like chewy, rip them apart, no crunch stale.  Another disappointing aspect was the bathroom. Rusty faucets, only one soap dispenser for three sinks (one had clearly fallen off) and dirty mirror.  If I'm paying top dollar for a beer and coming into station square rather than chilling at a local bar- it better impress. Bar Louie in Station Square does not. I'll try the one in the North Shore some time to compare."}
{"text":"Not sure if two stars is fair since I simply didn't care for what I ordered.  It wasn't what I expected and I'm not sure if it's their fault for not clearly explaining on the menu or mine for not asking questions.  I ordered the Jerk chicken and shrimp lettuce wrap.  I was expecting shredded or sliced chicken  with shrimp.  What came out was more of a gumbo with ground chicken and two shrimp.  And while the flavor was good there were some textures in it that I wasn't quite sure what,  tofu maybe,   that on top of the stew like texture turned me off.  I didn't finish it (which as I mentioned in another review is extremely rare for me).   But our server was great and the service was quick and polite. The drinks,  while overpriced,  were good too.  I do think I'd like to try it again ordering something else and asking a few questions before I do."}
{"text":"I was in town for a baseball game and grabbed some appetizers here before the game. We ordered cheese quesadillas, wings, chicken nachos, and the sesame chicken lettuce wraps. The food was good and the portions were decent. They need to improve communication with staff as we were seated and told a couple times someone would with us soon. Waited about 10 minutes til someone took our order and they were not crowded. Once we ordered our server was good, checking to see if we needed more drinks, etc. they had a nice outdoor patio. I would recommend for drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Came after a cardinals game. The servers were great, but unfortunately my food was raw - as in RAW chicken. Not pink. Raw. Thanks to all the other stuff on the sandwich I didn't notice it at first and ate some of this chicken!   I alerted the server who told his manager. The manager came by to tell me he had not charged me for the sandwich and offer a dessert (as if more food from that kitchen was a good idea). He also said it shouldn't have happened since they cut their sandwiches in half. Agreed. It shouldn't have happened. You know what else shouldn't have happened? I shouldn't have had to pay a single dime for that dinner.   I emailed the restaurant to tell them what happened  and didn't receive a response. My sister sent them a pic of my sandwich using their Facebook page and still no response. Clearly they don't care.   I could have really gotten sick. They need to clean that place up before someone really gets hurt."}
{"text":"Service was just ok, better than the last time. Ordered a burger medium well, got a Rare burger! Way over priced mediocre food. Drinks were good once we got them."}
{"text":"Seriously the staff is funny as he'll. Well at least I can refer to the bartenders ON FAT Tuesday."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times during happy hour - it's generally pretty busy but we've never had to wait. The drink specials are great ($3.50 drafts, $4.50 wines, and $5.50 martinis) and they also have half-priced apps, which are good. The only thing that's not great is the service. The first time I came, a friend in my group asked about a good allergy - the staff member we asked said he'd check and never came back. Another time my order got mixed up in the kitchen and had to be redone. In general, the service is just slow. Other than the service being meh, the place has got good deals and good food."}
{"text":"I came here with my boss to get a drink and talk about work stuff. The bar wasn't very busy so we sat there and had a few drinks- we really liked our bartender. I think her name was Uylia (sorry if it's misspelled).. Anyways I had a good time, there was a nice atmosphere. More people showed up because it was happy hour and we still were able to get new drinks and pay our bill within a good time frame."}
{"text":"I've had a pretty wide variety of experiences at Bar Louie.  Sometimes I go and the service is decent and the drinks are good, and sometimes I go and the service is really slow and the drinks are flat or just plain bad.  The one thing that is usually pretty consistent though is the food.  Any food that I have ordered has always been pretty good.  I've never had an amazing experience here, but I do still go back for food and drink specials and because of its location near the movie theater."}
{"text":"Ok. Third time here in 2 days. Just here for a drink tonight after a long dry conference. Place is hopping. Young crowd, drinks and dinner, all with a great view of the river. All three times I've been here the service has been great. The mussles with hot peppers in beer were great as was the flat bread chicken"}
{"text":"If there was an option for negative 5 stars I would give this place just that. We had a party of 9 and we all order drinks. Our waters took about 45 mins to come out and we only got 8 waters. We asked for the 9th one but it never came out. On top of that when we ordered our drinks we waited for about 90 mins and we only got 4 drinks that came out. They never took our order so we asked for a different waitress. The manager (Taylor Dennie, not sure if that's his real name) then comes out and ask if everything was okay? We answered honestly and said the service was bad. Then he proceeded to tell us that we didn't deserve his service cause we disrespected his server because we wanted a different one. The manager continue to escalate the situation and told us he doesn't understand how our drinks never came out because his bar wasn't backed up and then finally told us that we needed to leave. This place is absolutely awful and completely unprofessional. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I will start with the nice things, It has a nice location.  Now why I think its a joke. Food was typical and gross nothing to write home about. Service was horrific but it was past 10 and we just got in town with our kids and nothing else was open, so we had to stay or go hungry. We opted to sit outside in bad weather, overcast and wet because it was about 90 degrees inside and we all were sweating walking through the place. Bathrooms were disastrous and if I were in prison Id expect them to look like this. It took about 20 minutes just to order our food. Food and menu selection was minimal and nothing sounded or looked good.   4 days later my son had to use the restroom and being in Station Square park playing at the fountain, we were right here. I brought him in and the restrooms were just as the were 4 days ago, prison quality and hot. Again the place was like 90 degrees inside and we sweat just walking to the bathroom."}
{"text":"I came here with friends on the recommendation that some of them had tried the one in Columbus and liked it. We came in the afternoon. Our server was terrible, she seemed very distracted and in spite of the place being relatively empty, she kept disappearing. It was a long time in between when she'd check on us. By the end of the meal we actually had to get up and search for her to get our check only to find she was outside!! Secondly, the restaurant itself was pretty filthy, the floors and tables were sticky with stuff allover them, as well as the bathrooms. Anyway, the food was the only good thing, which is why I gave two stars. I had the street tacos, they were delicious. None of us had any complaints about our food, however we will probably not return or recommend."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place I have been here about 5 times. The food always seems to be okay. The prices are reasonable and the ambience is to die for. A very nice place to chill for drinks, have a first date or any date for that matter. Plenty of parking if you are like me and don't like cars parked right up on yours. However, let me tell you when you walk in you won't be greeted so first you want to look around and see where you want to sit, most likely the table will be nasty so don't sit yet cause you first have to hunt down someone to clean your table. Now after you sit try to look at the menu fast as you can and pick out everything from your drink to your appetizer to your main course. You are going to want to order everything at once cause believe me once you get your food you most likely won't see your waiter again. I did go one night and seem like everything had did a 360. It was on point, everything from the customer service, to the music, to the speed of service etc. That night the bar manager was working I think his name is AJ (he has a afro and glasses). It was so good I went back the next day and it was such a disaster my guest and I left! The general manager is such an a$$ to say the least! He is not professional at all! He is rude and doesn't even dress professional, he has not a clue how to run a restaurant or retain customers. The AJ guy puts him to shame as far as his customer service skills and how he deals with customers. So my advice is if you come pack your patients because this place is hit or miss just never know! I have notice they go through quite a bit of general managers and the one they have now I forget his name he is a light skinned a$$ and needs to go!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever, we came out for the first time to try the restaurant. When we walked in we were told to sit where we liked. We found a nice table and sat for 11minutes and decided that after three different servers walk within eye site of us and not being acknowledged we would leave.  As we were leaving one guy ran up to us and ask had we not been waited on.....we told him no and that we were leaving."}
{"text":"This place is the worst in Pittsburgh. NOBODY who lives in Pittsburgh actually even hears anything about it because it's horrible. The food is good but it usually takes about an hour and a half when they're slightly busy. Usually due to extremely poor service, talked with most of the service staff and it's their first serving job. IT SHOWS!!! I saw the young inexperienced staff mostly texting and being girly girls, OMG TTYL LOL YOLO!!? If your staying at the Sheraton next Door and don't know Pittsburgh there are other great riverside places to eat. The best happy hour in Pittsburgh??! WHAT A JOKE!! Soda watered down Martinis for 10 bucks yay!! The southside is right up the street with countless bars with 10x the cleanliness, 10x the service, and 10x the food quality. Our server still put an extra 20 percent gratuity on the check even though we tipped her cash. So if you want very poor service, treated like a dog and stolen from, Bar Louie is for you!! Can't wait for wannabe bar whatever finally closes and a great riverside club can take the real estate!!! Negative two stars!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Bar Louie is actually a lot fun and I can't say enough about the food. We have been a few times now and we try to always be in Miranda section, she really does make coming to this bar a blast. If you go, make sure you ask to sit in Miranda's section! I would come here again over and over again!"}
{"text":"I had the backyard burger and requested that it be cooked a again because the hamburger tasted funky.  My second burger was the same and bun was hard. Very disappointed.  Talked with the manager George and he said cook was new and if I came again he would cook burger for me.   What the world.  I won't go again I do apologize, i clicked the wrong place.  I was at BAR LOUIE....."}
{"text":"Well. I went here on Veteran's day. Wasn't sure what to expect, but I got the California chicken sandwich but asked if I could get a burger patty instead and they said no problem. The sandwich was pretty good... definitely no complaints about it. Yummy avocado, bacon, some sauce and the burger was well cooked. But forget about the burger, the tater tots were amazing. Like I mean they're just tater tots but they made them better than I have ever had them. Nice and hot, soft yet crispy. Perfect. The sangria was decent too, but a little stronger than I am used to. Might be back, cuz it is pretty decent. A little pricey, but isn't everything? Also, it did take a long time for our food to come out, but the waitress was nice..."}
{"text":"Server was just incredibly nice. The problem was it was and extremely slow night for them, yet it took a long time to receive our food and drinks. Plates were dirty. We complained to the manager about our drinks being watered down. He was completely rude, argued with what we had to say and went out of his way to yell have a good night (sarcastically) as we were leaving. Extremely immature."}
{"text":"This is such a great late night spot to go to eat and hangout ! The atmosphere is always fun .. The food is beyond delicious .. Staffs r nice n the atmosphere is really clean n warm! Their blt sandwich .. Burgers to appetizers are delicious n made fresh . When the chips come out at 12:00 at midnight n everything is warm n fresh ! I love this place !!!"}
{"text":"The food order came out wrong, what did come out was ice cold and the service was awful. Save yourself the trouble and money."}
{"text":"Service is just ok, food is just ok.  Nothing really bad but nothing really special.  Think a slightly upscale chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar at about 240 Saturday for appetizers and drinks. Not super busy but took over ten minutes for a draft beer and martini. Took 20 for appetizers. No offer to refill drinks or for water. Bartender was organizing glasses or drying glasses...passed us a couple times no eye contact despite empty glasses pushed forward. Others at the bar were also sitting with no drinks, no order taken, and I stress it was not full and the bartender was not busy making drinks. This is the second time this has happened at this location during the day when it's NOT busy. We will stick with Rock Bottom if we are at Waterfront during the day."}
{"text":"I came to Bar Louie for lunch on a Thursday with a coworker. We came at 11:30 to beat the rush. However, the slow service made up for that. All the servers seems lost bringing food out to the tables. None of them knew which table ordered what food, so they wandered aimlessly and asked each table if they ordered the items they brought out. The food itself wasn't very good either. The spinach and artichoke dip was probably the worst I've ever had. It looked as if it was sitting out for hours. It was about 90% cheese and had the consistency of one of those blocks of Velveeta cheese. The chips were not very fresh either. The California Chicken Club sandwich was OK, but the bacon was way undercooked and the bread was greasy. The tator tots could have benefited from some seasoning. I guess my expectations were a little high. I would come here to drink, but not to eat."}
{"text":"I just love this place!!!  It's so hard to pick your actual entree, everything sounds so delicious. For some reason I always end up with a Fry Louie. Can't help it."}
{"text":"What's sad is that I walked in at 1:22 and said You serve food till 1:30 right? Yes but let me check.  As she walked around for 10 minutes before she approached me again and said the kitchen is closed .....  No duh....thanks you  just making 4 full circles  I WOULD HAVE LEFT YOU A BETTER TIP YHEN U MADE IN THE PAST DAY!!!! I am in the biz and get it but fuck you and there chain cause we won't ever and I mean ever be back.  Hope the 15 minutes of you actually having to work was worth it. Sad.....would have been in and out in 20 minutes at most...  It is 1:48    Still open but still no nothing."}
{"text":"Absolutely pathetic service. From the moment I walked in until I paid my bill the service was two stars at best. I really hope a new management team can actually bring a sense of professionalism and service to that anemic crew."}
{"text":"Meh, I just don't see the appeal Bar Louis has to Pittsburghers. I guess this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the Waterfront stopping in after a shift. It's always packed. Being so close to the AMC theater, they get traffic before and after movies.   It's expensive, the food is so so. Before I get ahead of myself, I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad without chicken. The BBQ ranch dressing was very good, but it's very easy to duplicate at home. It's equal parts ranch dressing and KC Masterpiece hickory BBQ sauce and a drop or two of Worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce.   Tuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight, daily drink and happy hour selections, but even that's not enough to get me here. Skip it. One caveat for this location, free parking. At Station Square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopy.  I'm eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when Burgatory opens across the street."}
{"text":"Great selection of Vodkas, Good selection of martinies, okay bar food, nothing special."}
{"text":"I didnt have much here except for wayyyy too many lemon drop shots. A surprisingly amaZing tortilla soup and a surprisingly fresh poke.   It was a nice surprise. It instantly gave me Fridays/Chilis/applebees when I walked in but the food is much better. Pretty diverse crowd age and ethnicity wise with is nice. Coming from NY I didnt get a ton of that at the Cleveland restaurants I visited.   Will definitely stop in and chill/grab a bite/ watch the game next time I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I went during Happy Hour with a few friends.  The drink specials are why I would would want to give this place 4 stars but the food was just meh.    The draft menu was extensive and there were a lot of microbrews available on tap, so that gives me a reason to go back.  I was underwhelmed by the nachos and the verde flatbread pizza.  The cheese on the nachos looked and tasted very processed and the other toppings were minimal in comparison to the amount of chips on the platter.   Plus side, the boneless wings seemed to be a hit as well as the Bar Louie hot sauce they have on the table.  If you like spicy food, this sauce tasted great on everything.    Our waiter was also really nice and we had great service."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I wasn't on Yelp and subsequently wrote no review. My boyfriend and I had ordered mussels and even they were served some were still partially frozen! That was 3 years ago and I never went back, understandability so. This weekend I gave them another chance. We sat at the bar because we prefer this over a table. We got water immediately but it was downhill from there. Our server offered to split our salad since we were sharing, nice touch (in reality it's probably a way to get an extra few bucks.) It came out on one plate. With NO salad dressing. So we had to wait for dressing. The dressing we got tasted like it was made solely of corn syrup. Keep in mind that they make their own dressing here, so I'm presuming whoever makes it has a huge sweet tooth and a huge dentist bill. The salad was supposed to have blue cheese crumbles on it. There were none. We ate the salad, because we were tired of waiting. Nobody ever asked us how anything was, nobody ever asked if we wanted another drink until we were done eating. When we were done, we had to ask someone to get our server because ours was nowhere to be found. During our wait for the check done guy came in and sat at the bar. I watched him get fidgety because he was waiting far too long and nobody had come up to him yet. He resorted to waving his arm in the air in an attempt to get someone's attention. Completely unacceptable. You should be pounced on the second you sit down. Our wait to get out bill was 10 minutes. I spent 3 years before giving this place a second chance. They will not get a third. If you want good service go elsewhere. If you want good food, go elsewhere. Their food is average at best but it's the service that is reprehensible. I blame the management for not noticing and/or not caring."}
{"text":"Damn their mutha f***en burgers on Tuesday all all freaking $5, is the most beautiful epic thing I've ever heard of in my life I go there and check it out and end up trying the mushroom swiss burger and my mouth orgasm so bad that I was rushed to the strip club. Spent $350 and ran back to bar Louies so I could taste another one of their delicious $5 burgers OMG"}
{"text":"Wish I would have read the reviews first.  The burger and sliders took 35 min. The well done burger we asked for was rare.  Waitress was slow & didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"Don't bother- get Burger King instead. Overpriced and mediocre quality. $6,50 for a Sam Adams. Come on.  Burgers are dry, machine pressed, tasteless. I hate to give negative reviews but no choice. Lack of clients at prime lunch time a giveaway."}
{"text":"A really spectacular place to bring large groups on the North Shore. They have a ton of large tables for parties and the food comes out extremely fast. Great food and drinks, cool staff."}
{"text":"I needed that!  \"That\" being the Luigi steak sandwich with cheddar,  lettuce tomato, onion... seasoned to perfection!   And $5 martinis during happy hour?  Yep, that was certainly a \"happy\" hour!    I had not enjoyed that sandwich in about two years (since I moved here from Chicago)... so I am more than ecstatic that Bar Louie is now located here in AZ.  An easy 5 stars... yay!!!"}
{"text":"Closest place. From theater. Probably only reason still open. Bland food lousy service . Place half empty and still waited for long time for half the order and longer for the other half . Will not be back"}
{"text":"This was our first visit after a hockey game. We were excited to try something new. First order of business was picking out a drink. They are a martini bar and had lots of choices but I decided to go with a good ol dirty. It was perfect-served with blue cheese stuffed olives that were really good. I was impressed.  We both ordered burgers and tots. Although they were using the event menu there was still a good selection. I ordered the Burger Louie with bacon & blue cheese. I opted to leave off the fresh spinach and wish I would have asked for the buffalo sauce on the side. It was a little more tart than I like but my burger was still delicious. I really enjoyed the tots.  The service was really good especially since the place filled up with hockey fans. Honestly this is the first time we have eaten in Westgate that we both agree we would go to Westgate just to have dinner here. Needless to say we are fans."}
{"text":"I came here for Veterans Day for the free appetizers and burger, and boy, was I not disappointed! The verde chicken flat bread paired with the Bulleit Bourbon burger was a great mix! Add some bumble berry beer and Pineapple Express sangria and you have a party! It took a while to get some service as they were packed but our waitress was very attentive to our needs and recommended some tasty drinks! Yes, overpriced but also worth it as it was a night worth celebrating!"}
{"text":"Salad was warm and wilting. Appetizer looked and tasted like it came out of a can.  The dinner was so awful I returned it.  Very inexperienced and unenthusiastic waitress.  Worse dining experience I've had in recent memory."}
{"text":"Service for lunch was phenomenally slow. Food tasted fine but was not hot all the way through. Won't rush back."}
{"text":"The rap on this place was always generic corporate dbag turdhole. Everyone told me so. With that name and being at both Crocker and Legacy, it had to be true right? But suspend disbelief. Pretend the name is Stokes Bistro or Barnaby or some other contrived bullshit Clevelandy name all the gentrified near west side taco stands have. Pretend it's not in the middle of a parking lot, but underneath a bridge that connects whiskey island to a half submerged ore freighter. Pretend the hostess has gauged ears and a beard. Now you wanna eat there right?  We went at happy hour on a whim. Our destination was Beachwood Place, but the thought of being in a food court kind of freaks me out any more. Claddagh looked okay, but I felt like taking in the guaranteed shittiness of Louie. I like shitty. Too bad it was actually nicely decorated, moderately quiet, and not entirely overtly corporate. We got burgers. I had the Chicago stockyard. Cooked expertly with a nice side of frites and a Peruvian cocktail to wash it down. My dude enjoyed his Southwest burger and Angry Orchard(which I continued to pester him about for being the highest calorie cider in existence). I guess when you're not a raging alcoholic like myself, you can afford a few cider calories. Anyhow, the service was awesome, price was actually really good and I have no complaints.  Although, as we finished our meal close to 7 pm, you could see the dbag contingent start to filter in. I guess y'all were right about that. So my advice? Go there for lunch or happy hour. But that probably applies to just about anywhere."}
{"text":"A little lacking in flare. Drinks were good. Over priced, but good. Service was poor. Took 20 minutes for a drink at the bar. Then another 20 minutes to other food. Burger wasn't even all that good. Giving 2 stars because I liked my pineapple drink. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"The effen good martini is awesome. Staff is super friendly (as always) Clean bathrooms are a bonus.  Great environment and not too pricey :)"}
{"text":"Happy happy hour!!!!   I pass by this place all the time and have always wanted to try it out. We came here for happy hour and got the works. Food, drinks, u name it. And everything was delicious!  For the food we ordered the verde chicken flatbread and the boneless buffalo wings. Half buffalo and bbq. The bbq ones were really good.   Now onto the good stuff. $5 martinis, $4 wines! 1/2 off appetizers! My first martini was the Tickled Pink. This comes with X-Rated Fusion Liqueur, DeKuyper Peachtree, cranberry and orange juices. Quite tasty I must say. My 2nd martini, and when I saw this on the menu I just had to try it. S'Mores!! This is as amazing as it sounds! & for $5 why not? lol.  The drinks aren't that strong but they are quite tasty. I will definitely be coming back for some more martinis. =)"}
{"text":"This is definitely a nice location. At 1930 on a Saturday night it was very busy - 30 minute wait for a 2 top. Was able to combine a couple seats at the bar however right away. It was busier tonight that it was on Dollar Burger NIght when I was here last. The one section of the patio was still open - where there is part of one of the bars outside - they have it enclosed in plastic so it is an option for cooler weather seating as well. The menu is pretty big, but there are not a ton of super healthy options. I had the Mediterranean Salmon which was cooked well and flavoured good, thought a bit salty if anything. A nice place to meet friends and catch a game on TV. Seating options good for groups."}
{"text":"I've been to bar Louie twice in my lifetime once eight years ago in cranberry Pennsylvania and now on the northside. Both turned out to be the same exact situation poor service horrible food and wondering how this restaurant chain stays in business."}
{"text":"I gotta say I like bar Louie. The few times I have been in the experiences have always been good. My most recent visit was with friends and included a drink and some food. I'm embarrassed to say but I drank a blueberry vodka and lemonade...might be my new jam. Bartender recommended it, he knows his stuff. I ordered the hummus whisk came with tatziki, and one other dip, pits, carrots, and cucumber slices, all very good!!  The other guys went with flat breads and there was nothing left of them, so I am assuming they were delicious."}
{"text":"Good food, fun restaurant! Ready to go back and try more when I'm not eating healthy! They were super accommodating for my needs with food and I loved that they were so nice about it!"}
{"text":"Hair in food, dog food on a plate - terrible.  Manager took very good care of us afterwards, saving this place from an one star review. Maybe would return..."}
{"text":"Overpriced drinks and food. I had to give to the ounce instructions to the bartender just to he a drinkable cocktail, for which I was charged extra, even though I didn't get extra booze. The burger I ordered came on a stale bun that was soaked with grease and the meat itself was full of \"rubber bands and toenails\" on top of being terribly undercooked( I ordered medium- it came out rare/raw) and the fries were cold and tasted like old grease.         Their service industry discount is negligible at best and the service staff was rude, with exception of the one male bartender.        Definitely not going back and will recommend you avoid as well."}
{"text":"Stopped by to check out the new place opening at Tempe Marketplace since all the ads made it sound legit.   Decor: tacky. Like it wants to be Old Town, but comforting at the same time. Guess what, Tempe Marketplace is not the place for that.  It appears that they have decent specials. We asked the waitress if there were any specials right now (as in, like now, while we are here). She said yes but not right now, and then told us all the specials that are listed in the menu. Yes, I can read, I just read them.   Menu: there are no drink prices. Except wine. No prices on beer or the fancy cocktails it boasts.  Being adventurous, I ordered a honeydew martini blindly. Knowing it would be steep but not knowing how much of a dent this tasty treat would make. I figured if there are no specials and no prices, everything will be highway robbery, so I'll just get something yummy.  Boyfriend orders Budweiser. She asks what size, 14 or 20 oz. He asks which is better for the money. Most bar staff will tell you what is a better deal (as in a 20 oz is $1 more, making it a better deal). She explains that a 14 is smaller than a 20. Yes, we know how to do math as well.  $10 for the martini. $4 for the 14 oz Bud Light. What kind if bar doesn't even give you a whole pint of beer?   I would be willing to come back and try the $5 burger night. But for first impressions, this joint sucks. Sorry I'm not made of money, Bar Louie, I do live a mile from the university after all. I would rather head to Four Peaks where I can get a pitcher of beer for what we paid for 2 drinks.  The extra star is because the drink is good, but strong enough,"}
{"text":"When those midnight cravings hit, and I just need to get my hands on some nice, greasy, artery-clogging guilt food, Bar Louie is where I'll find it. As a veg head, I'm a personal fan of their Portabella burger. I live for their Tuesday $1 burger specials (but they make you buy a drink with the meal - those sneaks). I highly recommend the tater tots. Deep fried perfection! You won't find crispier tots anywhere else, folks.   I've tested out a few different apps, so here's the run down:    The Bruschetta Pomodoro has about a  pound of tomatoes for every crostini they give you. It's all fine and dandy until the moment of panic when you realize you're down to your last crostini yet you've barely touched the dip. The Bavarian Pretzel Sticks are over salted, but the dips are on point. The Hummus tastes like any ordinary hummus...that's all I really have to say about that. The Spinach Artichoke Dip is mediocre. Would've been better with pita than tortilla chips in my opinion."}
{"text":"I have to give Bar Louie 4 stars because my servers were absolutely fabulous (I changed my seating location).  This speaks volumes as you don't often get service this great!  I ordered the calamari appetizer and chocolate? cake for dessert.  The calamari was good but the cake was fantastic!  The serving was oversized so I had to take half of it home.  It was served with whipped cream that melted from the warmth of the cake.  It was yummy to my tummy!  Note:  This establishment is more of a family restaurant with a full bar."}
{"text":"The tempura shrimp was absolutely awesome! It was priced according and the environment was relaxing for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"service was not there and the food was not good.  left after ordering terrible nachos and went"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place doesn't have good reviews. The food and the service were both good. We had avocado fries as an appetizer. I had the sesame chicken wraps. My husband had the Fried Louie burger. Everything was cooked well. The place wasn't poppin'. It was good though."}
{"text":"With offices in Station Square this is a good place for lunch and happy hour. They offer food discounts to SS employees which is a plus. Just about everything on the menu is good. Love the pretzels and chicken nachos. Really amazing happy hour specials too. It can get super busy and the bartenders and servers are friendly even if some forget their customers now and again. It's not a big enough problem that I'd stop going; I just shout out to them when they get too hectic."}
{"text":"Awful service. Almost every time.  Most recently - 45 minutes after we ordered we got our appetizer. The wrong one. 30 minutes after that - the entrees. One was wrong. Saw the waiter 3 times in 90 minutes. Gross negligence. Food is ok. Not awful, but not great.  Decent selection of beers."}
{"text":"Just went to bar louies birthday celebration. We finally got a table after waiting 30 minutes. Waiter finally comes to the table and says we can't order anything, because the kitchen's backed up But you can order some drinks though. For a big event this place was definitely ill prepared. Majority of their business decided to go across the street to TGIF. By the way the title of the restaurant is spelled lower case for a reason, since I can't give a negative one star."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience here. The waitresses never took our order and when we asked her about it she contacted her manager, Taylor, who was very disrespectful and was not helpful at all. We all wish better bars would come to Weatgate."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is perfect here! The drinks are expertly mixed, the staff is attentive and courteous, and the music is lively and diverse. The perfect spot for a date night or a small to medium sized gathering. Couldn't ask for a better experience, thanks for the great service Bar Louie!"}
{"text":"I come here regularly on Wednesdays for their $1 beer night. Although, we stopped ordering the $1 beers and prefer the craft brews on tap, the crowd is always better on Wednesdays. Tuesdays is $1 burger night with the purchase of a beer.  Even though toppings are extra, it still ends up being worth it.  Recommendation: get a fried egg on the burger!  Yum!  Nothing like having a mess of yolk break all over and scooping up every last drop!  Also, a side of fries or tots is enough to share for two!"}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour on a Friday with about 12 other people. The food was some of the best I've ever had and the drinks were priced right! Great atmosphere and service. I would highly recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"I mean... It's good for what it is.  Good in the fact that it's probably about the only place in Station Square you can chill out with friends and enjoy the waterfront for a bit.  That is, if you're willing to shell out $5-10 to park.    I guess what I'm saying is... Station Square needs some help and Bar Louie kinda fits in with the whole chain-restaurant-tourist-trap appeal.  Do they have good happy hour specials?  Yes.  Is it quality?  Not really.  Does it do the job?  Yes.    Super sweet weak drinks and mediocre food.  Check.  If you're a tourst, check out all the fantastic local restaurants we have and skip this joint!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and had to use the restroom before we left. If I had used the bathroom before we ordered,we would have left! DIRTY BATHROOM, and it smelled!! This is a corporate location so it surprises me that the bathroom was so gross!"}
{"text":"Calamari was chewy.  Flat bread was bland.   Wait staff was grumpy.    Margarita was $10 and not good.    Not impressed."}
{"text":"The host was miserable; the waitress was unpleasant. If i wasn't with great company, I would have left right away. The food and drink were good, but the portions were small and the overall quality was not high enough to justify the cost.  My advice is to spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Service was awful for not being busy. Server was not the best and the food was not the greatest. Wouldn't recommend and in my opinion the meal was fairly over priced.."}
{"text":"Went out for happy hour sat for 15minutes before bartendar came over ordered one drink would have loved to order food and drinks no one ever came back and we sat at bar too bad because they have  great food and drink menu."}
{"text":"Awful! Don't go for lunch! Chips & Guacamole came out with old brown guacamole and when we sent it back they clearly just scraped off the top layer. Gross! All the salads we ordered had only lettuces with no other toppings....the veggie wrap only had spinach and three carrot sticks."}
{"text":"Tried Bar Louie's for the first time tonight while on date night with my man. We barely ever make it over to tempe marketplace and were gonna hit up Dave and busters, but hungry to try somewhere new.  The place was pretty busy for 930 on a Saturday but not overly crowded and got a spot at the bar. There was a live band playing which is always nice to have for background music. Bartender was fast at greeting us and gave us a minute to look over the drink/ food menu. I ordered the new old fashioned and my man got some new Sam Adams in a can, I can't remember the name. The drink was good and strong but I missed the muddle fruit on the bottom, but not a big deal. We ordered the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps and buffalo chicken flatbread. The flatbread was very good and nice and crispy but could have used just a little more toppings. I absolutely loved the concoction of the shrimp and chicken with the sauce and veggies but the \"lettuce\" part of the wraps was less than desirable. Not many pieces of lettuce and most of it was brown. Oh well, I'll remember for next time.   It was a nice little date night and we enjoyed the atmosphere, and will most likely try again."}
{"text":"I came here to grab an appetizer with friends.  It's like a sports bar, but with nice decor.  There are TV screens everywhere, but not so loud that you couldn't hold a conversation with your friends.  I ordered the chips and trio appetizer (salsa, queso, and guacamole).  No complaints about anything.  The cheese was good and gooey with a bit of sharpness.  The guac was nothing to write home about, but decent and fresh.  The salsa was the best out of all 3!  I tried a part of my friend's shrimp tempura appetizer and dipped it into a Thai chili sauce.  Yummm that chili sauce was delicious!  Sweet, spicy, and tangy.  For Tempe Marketplace, this is definitely one of my more favorite restaurants to eat at."}
{"text":"Had lunch here last week with my mom and brother.    The menu has mostly bar food (as expected).  The decor was interesting.  Typical bar in the middle.  Tv's around.  Restaurant portion.  The floors are concrete.  I didn't like that.  Service was slow and annoying.  Meaning the server annoyed me.  I ordered the Thai Chicken flatbread. It was nothing great, nothing bad.  Just average. I suppose it is what I expected."}
{"text":"Congratulations Bar Louie! Another 2* Review. Apparently, that's what you're aiming for. I went in tonight after I got off of work for a beer and some food, primarily because my brother had mentioned he thought the place looked cool about a week ago. Do not get it twisted; this place may appear busy on Wednesdays and any other day from 4-7 for one reason only, their happy hour prices are nice.   Their bar staff on the other hand can make Stephen Hawking seem like he has a bubbling personality. I'm a young single guy that eats out alone quite a bit because my work hours leave me eating past a normal dinner hour. I also worked industry for 6 years, so I know a bartender who's destined to work back of the house when I see one. My bar\"tender\" Crystal had zero personality, ZERO. I counted 5 singles and two deuces at the bar-top and she didn't engage one person in any conversation. Just pacing, making drinks, and complaining to coworkers.   Was a Wednesday night around 7:45 a little too much for you to handle (nine people, that's almost double digits...)? Need a second bartender up there? Or maybe just some Midol? Didn't receive a \"hello\" when I sat down, a smile with service, or a \"thank you\" when I was leaving. But, I did leave 20% because I know the industry and I almost felt sorry for her poor attitude.   The bottom of their receipt says \"Thank you for your business. We hope to see you again soon.\" Maybe they should tell their FOH employees to try to make people feel like they actually mean it.   Food: Meh Atmosphere: Decent Staff: Unimpressive"}
{"text":"We had a ladies night out in Saturday.  We arrived and we were seated in the front section.  Our server, Algeron, was so friendly and greeted us with a big smile.  He must really enjoy working there because his smile was present all evening.  We were there for a drinks.  He was very familiar with the special cocktails and made wonderful suggestions.  His friendly outgoing personality made our evening much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I was up here last month for a buddy's birthday party around St. Patty's, and we decided to go to Bar Louie with a fairly big party for dinner. We  walked in with around 10-15 people, and they were great about seating us, but after that everything went downhill.  I'd say for the most part our server was beyond inattentive and the cause of most of the problems. We put in some appetizers, and then she returned to take dinner orders, but only took a few people's orders before walking away. Okay, maybe she needed to go grab something, but after about 10 minutes of her not coming back, I went to go find out the deal. When I found her by the bar and told her we still had half the table that needed to order, she said she didn't realize we were still ordering more. Really? Do most of your tables only have half the table ordering food?  Whatever, we get our orders in, and that should be the end of that. We then had a couple more people join us for drinks, and after requesting specific draft beers, the server had to go back and forth to the bar about three times, each time letting us know they didn't have it. You really should know what you are and aren't out of. It would make the process a whole lot quicker. By the time my friend got her beer, it wasn't even the right one, but she ended up drinking it anyway. The server seemed incredibly out of it the whole time.  Some of the food was good but quite a bit of it was cold, and I don't think any of it was memorable. I had some wings and the meatball sub (I can't find it on the menu on the website, but it was definitely there), and it was all pretty average.  The Bar Louies in Columbus don't blow me out of the water, but at least the service is decent, and most of the servers are pretty nice. Luckily, we had a good rest of the evening, so were able to put that all behind us. I'd say it was a one off night, but it scares me because the restaurant wasn't all that busy. I'd probably avoid this one next time in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I feel like this place should be a little more popular. Maybe it is the odd location, or the fact that it is a chain, but it was a nice surprise. The decor is nice and relaxing. It feels like a casual lounge.   The drinks were really good, too. They have tons of martini, cocktail, beer, and wine options. They also have nice 'small plate' items and snacks to complement the drinks.   Bar Louie is a fun place to hang out with some friends or a date, and try a variety drinks and snacks. I wish it was closer to the metro area, but definitely glad we checked it out."}
{"text":"After a couple of minutes standing at the door, we were greeted and told to seat ourselves.  \"This place doesn't have a sign that says to seat ourselves,\" Tran D. whines slightly.  \"It also doesn't have a sign that says to 'Please wait to be seated.'\"  I win.  But then I got the Watermelon Fizz to copy Transter and instantly lost because that thing was too tart to drink.  It was so tart that it was almost to the point of bitterness.  Our waitress, Crystal, gave us some sugar to try and help but it couldn't be done.  I legit had a full untouched glass on the table and was still charged the $5.  Darn.  At least the food and company was good.  I had gone with the Pear & Blue Cheese Salad and Tran got the Loaded Tots.  These plates were huge and we ended up sharing our plates.  The cheesy hot goodness from the tots with the pickled jalape√±os paired surprisingly well with the sweetness and fresh taste of the salad while the blue cheese gave everything a little funk.  I enjoyed myself.  We couldn't finish either of the plates since they were so generous with their portions either but we picked away at both plates while spinning two nearby Pok√©stops while laughing insanely over Pok√©mons that kept running away. We're nerds.  We want to pop into Bar Louie again for some good eats.  $5 burgers on Tuesdays from 5pm-close? Aw yeah!   As a side-note:  I can't remember if we got the 15% off our bill.  Oh well!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times and they have a great outdoor patio and good weekday happy hour specials. Today, we decided to stop on the weekend.  Our server was just rude. We tried to be nice but she never even cracked a smile. I ordered mac & cheese and my husband ordered a 4 taco plate. We were both disappointed by the very small servings. We also ordered Blue Moon draft beers which cost $7.00 each, only 75 cents cheaper than beer at Heinz Field. The price was not published and we foolishly did not asked before ordering. At least the bathroom attendant was pleasant..."}
{"text":"I came here last night to get a few appetizers before a movie, and was hoping to be able to write a review on the food. Unfortunately, I cannot because the service was so bad that I left before I had the chance to order. We found seats at the bar behind the taps. After sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged, we thought that they might not be able to see us, and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar, grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order. It was fairly busy, but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and I'm sure they face much busier times. We sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (I timed it - I am not exaggerating), and were not even acknowledged. You would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could, but despite staring him down almost the whole time, we could not even make eye contact. I hope this is a fluke but will probably not be back to find out."}
{"text":"I stopped here yesterday with Rob and Matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing \"The Hangover\" at Loews across the street.  Incidentally, \"The Hangover\" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie's I've been too.  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  Maybe I'm being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer.  This was surprisingly pretty good.  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  It's probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  All in all this place isn't that bad.  If you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and you're more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse."}
{"text":"Bar Louie is AWESOME. Fast service, great waiters/waitresses, awesome bartenders I would come back!!"}
{"text":"I got a delivery through Delivermefood.  Delivery was fine but what was delivered was disappointing.  I got the Monaco salad which ended up bring a couple handfuls of lettuce, some sparse grilled chicken, a couple grape tomatoes and a few thin slices of apple.  Sounds fine but for $13 I would have been much better off with a salad from Wendys.  The salad was uninteresting, had much less chicken than is expected and the garlic bread that came with it was both mushy and stale.  Not worth take-out!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that our experience today was probably a rare thing for this restaurant and we just happened to be there during this not so good day for some of the employees. My husband and I decided to have a lunch date on this beautiful Friday in Charlotte. Neither of us had been to this restaurant but have heard many great things about it, so we decided to stop by for lunch and drinks.  It was around 1:00 when we got there, they weren't very busy, just a few tables. The last time we were in this building it was the previous restaurant before. I loved how they remodeled the inside and the whole vibe was nice when we first got there. We were told to sit wherever, so we did. The gentleman that was our server greeted us and asked for our drink order. We ordered a couple adult beverages and a couple glasses of water.  They seemed to be very very short handed, the only person we saw was him at the time. After about 5-7 min, no drinks yet, and all of a sudden we hear some commotion from the kitchen. Two ladies were arguing and cussing at each other, and when I say cussing, I mean f-bomb at least ten times from one girl and loud enough to hear it word for word. Also sounded like some glass cups being slammed around and that went on for about 5 more min. MEANWHILE, we still have not received our drinks, it's been 15 min give or take. Then our server stopped by our table to apologize for the delay, they are busy, yadda yadda yadda, and doing their best. While he's talking with us and taking our food order, two female employees come out from the back and get back to work. One was the bartender (I guess) and the other was tending to tables on the other side of the restaurant and the patio. So our server took our appetizer order (Calamari and mussels) and our meals (Veggie wrap with salad, and fish tacos) So it's been 20 min or so, and the lady from the bar brings our adult beverages but not our waters, had to wait another 5 min on those.  So we are just chatting and about 10-15 min later, we get the calamari. Then again, seemed that the three employees all went to the back, and the girls start arguing again. I'm thinking that someone is seriously about to lose it and go crazy.......  A couple min later, the bartender chick brings out our food minus the mussels....... My husband asked her \"I'm guessing you guys didn't get the mussels did you?\" And she said no. No apology, nothing. So my husband said just forget about them then. Our server came by and asked how the food was, good, and I asked for another drink. Apparently he forgot about it and I ended up getting the bartender to get it.  So we finished our food and drinks, paid and left. The only thing that kept us from leaving was we didn't have a ton of time to start over somewhere else, and we were hungry. I understand that people have crappy days, things don't go right at work, etc. but don't be unprofessional and make yourself look bad in front of customers. Act like you care when their order is screwed up. The three workers that we saw this entire visit never cracked a smile, looked stressed out and tense and made the whole dining experience awkward. Please do better, the food was good and I'd like to come back, but I don't want to be in the middle of a cat fight......"}
{"text":"I REALLY want to give Bar Louie a higher rating.....because they have so much potential and because the menu is very good. But:  - good service is not consistent - food quality can also, sadly, vary... The rice from our rice and beans side dish was undercooked. Really undercooked.  - also, don't know how to interpret this....but we ordered for take out and the portions are the same price, but absolutely, notably smaller"}
{"text":"Bar Louie doesn't care about black people. I stopped in with my father and his friends while visiting Cleveland in late August of this year. It was an early Sunday evening, and not too busy, until about 30-40 black folks showed up. (An all black day party in the area had just ended. By \"all black\" I mean people had to wear all black to get into the party, you didn't have to be black to attend, that would be almost as racist as Bar Louie itself, though most party-goers were black).  Anyhow, after the group arrived, we tried to order food. The bar tender told us the kitchen had just closed. My pop's friend asked why, and she said, \"Because of those people.\" He replied, \"What do you mean by those people?\" and she just smirked. We laughed it off, giving her and Bar Louie the benefit of the doubt. Hey, maybe she has a sense of humor like the always hilarious Daniel Tosh!   We stuck around and had a couple of drinks. By that time, the large group of black folks had left, many seemingly disappointed that they were unable to order food. Voila! The kitchen magically reopened, and began serving subpar food. We asked the bartender about the sudden reopening. She wouldn't give us an answer. My dad's friend said, \"Because all the black folks left?\" The bartender smirked again."}
{"text":"Came here for a happy hour with co-workers. Flatbreads were good. Would never pay full price for them though. Also, since we were a large group, the waiter made and exception and allowed us to use our free appetizer vouchers (which you can get by signing up for their mailing list) per person instead of per table. 45 minutes later and after everyone had ordered their own individual appetizer he comes back and tells us that management won't allow him to give us the deal. He gave us the happy hour prices instead (even though happy hour was over) but it still left a bad taste in my mouth. Don't over promise and under deliver."}
{"text":"Bar Louie is kinda' in an odd place. With it being nestled between a university area and large corporate centers, I see the crowd as being one sided, primarily happy hour corporate crowd.    Not your typical restaurant, but it can't shake that restaurant feel. With it's dark, modern finishes, I see some swank, but the space is just so large that it's hard to think of it as a lounge.  They offer weekly specials, with the $5 burger seeming to be most popular.  I can't recollect on what else I've had there, but I can at least attest it wasn't horrible, albeit wasn't entirely memorable either.   All in all, a great addition to the scene and a nice place to grab drinks."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Waitress was a huge air head. Waited 25 min for my $7.00 beer. Only got it after I reminded her. It is just another disappointing chain restaurant disguised as a local commodity."}
{"text":"My sister and I went here for happy hour and loved it. Great prices for food and a good selection for happy hour priced beer. The food was great, the beer was good and the outside seating was perfect. However the waitress didn't attend on us how she should of. She made us wait on her at times. But other than that, great place!"}
{"text":"One dolla holla! Such excitement yet such epic failure when the Tuesday $1 custom burgers showed up naked as all get-out. One can't really complain for a $1. But, when Betty barkeep remediated the situ and fetched all of the toppings initially ordered, the burger and portabella were worth the wait. And gimme some more o' dem tots yo! Straight up addictive with salt + pepper and a hint o' lime. Bar Louis is showing its age, but it has been an anchor at the ever-changing Waterfront."}
{"text":"My fiance and I sat at the bar. Waited 7 minutes for a greet. The bartender, Adrianna, made eye contact with us twice with no acknowledgement. She finally came over to us and instead of a proper greet she rudely asked for our ID's and then asked, 'What do you want?'. Adrianna seemed in a rush even though it's only 11:00pm and they don't close until 2:00am. We did not feel welcomed. She wasn't busy having three bartenders and only 12 other guests sitting at the bar. We stayed for an hour to which she never checked up on us. At the check out, she just gave us change with nothing to say. Beyond rude.... If anyone sits at the bar, stay away from her..."}
{"text":"This location has been very nice and great to have food and drinks. Blake is a fantastic bartender and made the Bar Louie experience that much greater! I would recommend him to anyone at Bar Louie hands down!!"}
{"text":"I went in on Friday with a friend of mine before a movie. We sat on the patio for 15 minutes before we were greeted. Our server Christian was rude and had no manners. His first sentence out of his mouth was not \"hello, how's your night going?\" It was a snarky \"If you're drinking I need to see IDs!\" We ordered quickly and waited another 15 minutes for our beers. Christian dropped our beers off then asked \"you want food?\". The food came out quickly but was unfortunately incorrect. We would of asked our server to fix our order if we would of seen him at some point during our meal.   I've been here many times before movies but maybe next time I'll just go to Thirsty Lion."}
{"text":"Solid service. Personable bartenders. However, once the significant other complains about the bathrooms...it's over."}
{"text":"Simple! I won't go back again. Unorganized!! You seat yourself and everyone will ask you over and over if you have been served! You want to know why? Because it took over an hour to get anything on our table. And it was not even busy on a Saturday afternoon. The food was just ok. So unless you are starving pick another place. Well! Pick another place even if you are starving too as you will end up in a hypoglycemic coma before you get any food if you really are starving!!!!!"}
{"text":"I won't lie, it's possible I've been here too many times.  The first time I experienced Bar Louie was at home in Newport, KY on the Ohio River.  This has no city skyline or boats going by, but it is still pretty great!  My favorite thing on the drink menu by FAR is the bloody mary!  If you're into Bloody's you will love this one, it's like a meal in a glass. (=    In terms of food I never really branch out from what I know.  The chicken nachos are pretty great, but they changed the cheese which made them...pretty decent.  The pretzel dipper thingy's are thee bomb dot com!  My boyfriend and I recently ventured out into the world of Bar Louie sliders.  They were surprisingly d'lish!  All in all, I think this is a great place to kick back in TMP and have a drink or three.  It's possible I may be a little bias because it's somewhat of home away from home, but I would still recommend you try it out ! :)"}
{"text":"Nice location. Walking distance from Progressive Field, Hotels, The Q. Nice size food menu, awesome drink selection, plenty of TVs. Big tables available for big groups. Kinda first come first serve. Awesome waiter. Good was excellent. Our group of 7, had 0 complaints or issues. Definitely coming back if back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We went to this location once before and food/service was spot on. Made a second trip before and event and our experience was totally different. Food was spot on but we had to wait almost 2 hours for it. Why did we wait?  Not sure.  We sat waiting for drinks for 44 minutes. Two waitresses later and drink orders were incorrect. Our waitress left mid order to tend to another table???  When we finally got our food orders, food was fine but we were all dry in the drink department. Asking for the check was another hassle. Talked to manager and got our dinner on the house. I shouldn't complain but we found out our waitress was new. Not her fault. They gave her such a big area with no guidance and help and the whole seat yourself is a disaster. Definitely needs some improvements. Would like to go back as the food was good but the service was not."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE the FOOD! Service NO SO MUCH. . I went with a small group of lady friends during lunch hour, food was great menu was stellar with lots of options that were unique twists on old time classics. . However the services was lacking more than personality, i would say brains and a heart. We sat on empty for countless rounds of tea and beverages prior to our order arriving, so despite the length of time between ordering and parchment at our table the food, location and atmosphere was worth 5 stars.. however if i go back and have a similar experience with staff i may have a decline in opinion. ."}
{"text":"Don't waste waste your time before an event if you want to drink and or eat. You will be standing in a line watching the people inside being ignored by the staff inside. If you finally get in, you will die of thirst and starvation. (Reference posted picture of Cali chicken club)"}
{"text":"Such great food and the service was incredible we had Jamie as a server and she was awesome. On top of all the drinks and orders. I'm definitely going to be recommending Bar Louie and Jamie to friends and family. Also a great location"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times with my friends and my boyfriend and the food is always on point. The servers are OK but the other day me and my boyfriend went and we had Holly as a waitress. She's probably the best waitress I ever had she was amazing!!! The food was bomb.com and what topped it off is my boyfriend left his cell phone in there and when we came back an hour later she had picked it up and held it for him. Thanks Holly!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was an incredible surprise! Happy Hour on a Thursday evening and some great specials. Good drink prices, good beer selection, nice cocktails. The Happy Hour food menu was priced very well and all was quite tasty. We shared the flatbread, calamari, bruschetta and a few chopped salads and couldn't have been happier with our choices. I will say that the wait time for our food exceeded our patience by a few minutes. At 45 minutes wait time for appies, that's quite a wait. We'll try this place again though for the prices and delicious food. A five star review if service had been snappier."}
{"text":"If you're meeting up at Bar Louie for a drink, then this place will likely meet your needs. If you're planning to eat here, consider other options.   Outside of the normal bar food, Bar Louie has a pretty extensive menu. The problem? Its executed poorly. Dry burgers, salads drenched in dressing, and flavorless tacos.   This is not somewhere you'd want to take anyone to leave lasting impressions."}
{"text":"Bar Louie needs to stick to just serving drinks....I would never eat there again I ordered the Blackberry, Brie,and Orange Salad. Added chicken.  The chicken was awful! And the server even made a point to say that the order was taking a little extra time, because they were grilling the chicken fresh!     Liar!   It was dry and completely devoid of any flavor.   I would normally just send it back, but I really was starving and just ate around the chicken.  The salad was not even close to being worth $13."}
{"text":"The food was delicious however the drink prices were ridiculous!! I would only eat/drink here if there's a special.  As for the customer service...I totally agree with previous posters comments. I think John from Bar Rescue could help them out.."}
{"text":"So good! Can I just say Ranch to die for! Awesome burgers awesome beer good music good atmosphere I just don't know what else to say about this place it's pretty BA! Priscilla Rocks!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 9:50p and we were greeted at 10:06p.  The entire time we were waiting, not one server appeared on the patio.  One finally came over and asked what we would like, I asked if they were closing soon and she said \"no, why?'.  I mentioned that we had been waiting 16min for someone to come and take our order and she shrugged and blew it off. After placing our orders, someone else brought the food out.  She finally reappeared after we were done.  There were no, \"how was everything?\", no \"would you like anything else?\".  Just a \"here's the bill\".  The food, while good, is not worth the lack of service.  If you go, the bacon/burger sliders are great."}
{"text":"Convenient location right outside South Park mall. Fast and efficient service with good bar food. We ordered the loaded tater tots - which were good but didn't seem \"loaded,\" the jalape√±os were chopped up too large to eat (had to cut them into smaller pieces). My friend ordered the grilled veggie flat break pizza which she enjoyed. I ordered the Mac n cheese with broccoli and jalape√±o (again, oversized) which was average. Overall a good place to catch up with friends or go watch a game. Good average bar food."}
{"text":"If you have a large group and want to enjoy some great happy hour specials then here is the place to come.  I met some friends pretty late at night and for Pittsburgh standards, it was one of the few places actually open and serving food.  I ended up getting the club sandwich which wasn't anything remarkable.  The beer selection was great and kept our drinks flowing.  However that was to where the extent service was good.  When it came to food, service was kind of slow.  It could have been that they were understaffed in the middle of the week, I'm not really sure, but when all my friends ordered and received their food, it took us several times to get the waitress' attention to even inquire about my food, let alone the wait time.  For the cheap food and drink specials for a place that's open late night I definitely recommend coming here, however, for anything else I suggest eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very broad menu- drinks and food. They are known for their selection of martinis. The appetizers are great. I was told to come here because their baked Mac n cheese was \"the best.\" I was disappointed when the noodles weren't cooked all the way, and the cheese was very runny. The bread on the side was also stale. It was a good experience, don't get me wrong, and I'll certainly go back. But, I will get something other than."}
{"text":"Good relaxed spot to grab drinks and pub food with friends while watching the game. We stopped in on a Friday evening and had a very attentive staff, quick service, solid recommendations, and some great cocktails. The food was good and reasonably priced. There was a lot of space with booths, tables, and bar seating. They also have many large screen tvs over the bar airing several different games so that you can get your sports fix in."}
{"text":"Love the happy hour at this place. Went here before the GNR concert and all the servers and bartenders were dressed up like rockers. Great value and beer selection. I do with there were more porter/stout options, but I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fun bar and a good location.  I have tried a few of their dishes and they were all yummy.  Definitely better than your average"}
{"text":"Chicken nachos came out cold. The waitress comped us chicken quesadillas, but I bet they took the chicken from our nachos and put them in the quesadilla, hahaha, huge chunks still kind of cold. Kind of sad, I remember their food being good, but these are fuzzy, drunken memories... Happy hour has good prices."}
{"text":"Great place for late night.  Excellent happy hour prices as well. They have a huge cocktail menu and an awesome draft beer selection"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks but when having a Martin they fill the glass about half full. Order wine and still poured short compared to other locations. Charging that much for a drink should at least get what other locations server"}
{"text":"Used to come here every Wednesday for Dollar Beer night (domestics only to be exact), however due to inflation, the domestic bottles are up to $1.25 these days. Splurge on a corona for $2 or if you're fancy get foo-foo martinis for $5. Wasn't too busy last night so service was prompt. Very spacious for large parties, choose a booth, regular table, high top tables, bar or plush couches by the fireplace. I  When it comes time to break the seal, excrete like a boss in these private closet like stalls. Clean, fresh smelling with full size mirrors to check out your outfit and ensure no clingy toilet paper to your shoes or accidental stuffing of toilet seat liner in your panties (not that it's ever happened to me before).  As for food, I've only indulged in the Dollar Burger night, which is on Tuesdays. Yes it's a steal even if you have to pay a little extra for toppings (tomato, pickles, egg etc). Hey make it your way, can't put a price on happiness. In the past, they've always cooked to my preference, medium rare without disappointment.   For parking, unfortunately no private lot. Have rarely had a problem finding parking meter parking. In downtown CLE, meters are free Mon-Fri after 6:30pm til 7am and all day Saturday and Sundays."}
{"text":"Come for dollar burgers on Tuesdays and dollar beers on Wednesdays. For this deal it obviously gets crowded but the burgers aren't too shabby. Dollar beers actually are now up to $1.25 for select domestics but still a steal! Easy parking in legacy but take your chances findin parking if you go I the downtown location"}
{"text":"What a surprise!    I expected this place to be crawling with young college kids (sorry college kids.).  But I was happy to find it full of professionals coming in on a Friday night to check out the awesome happy hour.  I stopped in with 7 co-workers on a Friday!  I was the first to arrive.  I walk in and look around for a hostess stand... nothing.  I'm doing that distressed \"what the hell do I do now\" look around.  Waitresses walk past, no one says anything.  I finally flag someone down and ask \"is there a hostess stand\"?   Nope, no hostess.   You snag your own table.  (Apparently there is a sign outside, that I didn't see.  Get it together Bar Louie, it takes 3 seconds to say, \"Seat yourself\" when someone misses the sign. It has to happen all day and I think they are VERY silly for walking past me like they did.)  Good thing I got there just before 430, there was a huge 8 top table open... and there were exactly 8 of us coming.    After seating myself, a waitress stops by to show me the HH specials and the menu.  This is where this place really made an impression.... HH 4-7pm!  Awesome food and drink deals.  They had a Hendrick's Martini on the HH ($5.25)....  awesome.   I enjoyed my appetizer (calamari), side salad and I had the dirty Martini x 2.  Good deal, total 18 bucks.  I am with it.  My return factor is 50%.  A definite return for HH after work."}
{"text":"Ordered three appetizers. 2 came out way before the third one came. Calamari was cold. They took it back but didn't replace it.....service was slow. Server had more tables than she could handle:("}
{"text":"What I ordered: Blackened Salmon Sliders (no tomato) with fries Pineapple Express Sangria   The salmon sliders was the *bleep* lol. It was moist and not dry at all. It had bacon, which was a plus, and the sauce was spicy and really good. I really like the fries and my drink was huge (a lot) and tasty. Wanted to actually order another drink but I didn't want to be late for the movies. One thing that was kind of funny/weird was when I asked my server/bartender if they had pear cider, her facial expression was off...it was like I asked her something inappropriate...it's just pear cider...that's all.  But other than that, I can see a return visit...mainly for the drinks (alcohol)."}
{"text":"I give this place five stars bc the management stepped up and gave us a great experience. Our waitress avoided us bc it was a busy night. We sat for over 20 minutes without being acknowledged. A manager approached us and asked if we had been helped. We politely said no. He ordered our drinks, and told us about the specials. He also apologized and gave us a 20 percent discount. I understand people and business make mistakes. And when you acknowledge them as this manager did, you earn repeat customers!"}
{"text":"Weak $10 martini!  What a waste and thank God I brought my flask to make it right.   Frozen food quality, nothing fresh about it.  I had burning indigestion all night from it, then not surprisingly diarrhea in the morning.  The waitress was the only positive comment about this awful, undesirable, overpriced \"restaurant.\""}
{"text":"Great late night place from drinks and food. Service was very quick and friendly. Nice layout and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Visited here for lunch today. I had been to the Bar Louie's in Kansas City previously so I felt comfortable enough to know what to expect and didn't felt compelled to check Yelp reviews before arriving. Had I done so, I wouldn't have looked completely confused upon entering since there was no hostess stand or the typical 'Seat Yourself' sign. I found a bartender finally who confirmed you could sit anywhere and picked a seat inside but along the windows to still see outside. The patio seemed nice but not enough umbrella's to shade the tables at the 1pm sun and the atmosphere inside seemed more like a sports bar with the TV's around the bar than the one I visited before. No big deal, just different.  My waitress arrived several minutes later and provided menus while I was waiting for the other person in my party to join. I was in the mood for salad and was excited to see all the varieties of salad options. I ordered an ice tea and eventually the orange brie salad with the $4 upcharge for chicken at the recommendation of the waitress.   When my salad arrived, I was a little stunned. For $12, you usually get twice as much chicken and at least 30% more of a salad and other ingredients. As one of the other reviews stated, even my blackberries were cut in half and I got a total of TWO blackberries. Really?!?! In addition, I'd say there was about half an orange and maybe 5 small to medium chunks of brie. Not what I was expecting for a full salad that was expected to be my meal. This was just slightly larger than a dinner salad.  I will say that it did take me longer to eat than expected and I felt full when I left. Unfortunately though, 2 hours later I was hungry again. What a waste of $12. The ice tea was descent though but $19 for a small salad and ice tea is WAY overpriced. I could do better at McDonalds for a same sized salad and drink for $5.  Don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"Unbelievably poor service and food. First the service was extremely poor and slow. When I finally received my dinner it was cold. After the waitress took it back to the kitchen she actually came back to the table and stated, \" Don't worry, it wasn't your fault, your dinner sat while they made the burgers and other dinners\". Cannot believe that kind of statement would actually be made to a customer. Still wondering how being served cold food could ever be thought of as being the customers fault."}
