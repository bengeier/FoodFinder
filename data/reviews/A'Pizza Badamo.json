{"text":"Starving after a long day at work, we looked for somewhere to order a pizza that we had never tried. We settled on A'Pizza Badamo and placed our order, a 16\" 10 cut pizza, topped with sausage crumbles, onions, green pepper, and artichokes. We were given a total, and told 40 minutes. The food arrived hot and delicious in just 25 minutes!! A thin and crispy crust, fresh toppings, this may have been the yummiest pizza we have tasted yet! Call them now! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best pizza I've had in the Pittsburgh area. It was like being back in NYC."}
{"text":"Good pizza but pick up. We have had to wait over an hour and a half multiple times. Well past what they estimate."}
{"text":"This is worth a drive!
Pizza is about taste, familiarity, and most of all fun!
When I eat at Badamo's, the fun factor is in the greetings and appreciation expressed by employees.
They toss their crust in the window...and oven baking is perfect!
Great order in-take out- or casual date night!
Love these guys
Love their Pizza
**Highly Recommend my favorite \"White Pizza\"!!
Whole pie in 4 sizes-or by the slice!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to pizza spot.  The staff is energetic and friendly.  The pizza is great, but for me what puts it over are the other little things they provide, such as a wide selection of beverages (the yerba mate tea is awesome).  The salads have field greens, not garbage ass iceberg lettuce.  I also like that it's BYOB."}
{"text":"I have never posted on here before but was compelled to do so after my experience with A'Pizza Badamo tonight.  This place has always been expensive, and the price used to be worth it.  However, the quality of the food has steadily declined while the prices have gone up.  Tonight the food was inedible.  We got a pizza (half pep/ half onion) and a large salad.  The pizza tasted rotten (like expired ingredients were used or something) and the salad tasted like pesticide.  We couldn't eat any of it.  Order at your own risk."}
{"text":"Now this is pizza!! The pizza here is sooo good. Crispy crust. Delicious sauce. And just the right amount of cheese. The staff is knowledgable and friendly. The shop is adorable. The options are endless. I also love the fancy soda collection it pairs nicely with the vibe they have created. My husband and I spent many years in NYC and for us this is the best pizza in the 'burgh!"}
{"text":"I come here occasionally with my daughter and love the staff and the owner!! Super friendly people!! The white pizza is out of this world and the steak hoagie is bomb!"}
{"text":"The owner is a great guy, I'm happy he's doing well. The pizza here is excellent.I love the fresh basil one. A'Pizza Badamo is one of the only places my entire family agrees that the food is good, so we can all eat here, so that's a big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Oh my! I've eaten here a few times in the past few weeks and it's always been amazing!
First I went basic, small pie with pepperoni. Perfect. Doughy crust and crispy pep with flavor in between.
Next Steak calzone. It could have fed a small army. I was very hungry so I was grateful. 
But tonight, Steak Hoagie. WOW! Really wow! Done right, onions, mushroom, pesto sauce. Incredible! 
I'll be back there soon!"}
{"text":"As luck would have it, this is my local pizza shop.  The only thing I've gotten here is pizza, it's so good I can't tear myself away from it. It rivals the best pizza joints in NYC. The dough is thin, with a little bit of chewiness to it and just the right amount of crunch in the crust. I've never had cheese like this before.  This is not the typical generic mozzarella. There's a smokiness to it that makes it incredible. It tastes like there's some other cheese with it as well, but I can't name it. Or maybe it's just the good quality mozzerella that you don't get most other places.                                                         

Enough about the pizza. Not only is it quality food, they are quality people. Screw the Olive Garden. When you're at A'Pizza Badamo, you're family. Anthony makes a point to at least say \"hi\" and \"thanks\" to everyone, no matter how busy he is slinging dough. I think he's going for the title of \"Mr. Mt. Lebo.\"  I think he knows everybody.  Everyone else there is super cool too. 

This has been Mt.Lebo's best kept secret for too long. I'm so happy that the word is getting out about this place. You have to try it, it will quickly become one of your favorites."}
{"text":"After moving to Pittsburgh several months ago, I finally gave this place a chance. I was worried that the pizza would be a grease-bomb like other pizzerias in the area, but this pizza was fantastic! :)

The crust was perfect, it held its shape, and really made the pizza. The sauce was great, the toppings were fresh. It was clearly made with care. I enjoy pizza, but am extremely picky about how its made, and I was impressed.

I got the chance to speak with the owner for a few minutes as well, and honestly, both him and the staff were warm and wonderful! They took the time to wipe down a larger table for us to sit at, bring the pizza over for us, and provide a box when we had leftovers. Maybe none of those things are out of the ordinary at any good restaurant, but they were welcoming and friendly. It felt like you were at a friend's house! There were kids there the entire time, as well as people constantly stopping in (and I'm pretty sure the delivery guy was rarely there for more than a minute or two at a time!). The owner seemed to know everyone personally, and it was just a warm place.

Overall, I highly suggest trying this place out. It's small, but the warmth from the food and the kind staff really make it the place to go. I will probably be back this week! :)"}
{"text":"Best in town!!  

We recently moved to PGH and immediately went on a quest to find the best Pie.  I walked into A'Pizza by chance to try it out and loved it.  

To me, the pie is aperfect balance of crust thickness and flavor, fresh sauce, and their 3-combo cheeses (it's defiantly more than just mozzarella).

I have been to other places that people from the burgh tell me to try, but I still think Badamo is #1.  Bravo Badamo, il suo pizza Ã¨ sempre la migliore!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and friendly service. The ingredients are fresh. The toppings are always generous. Definitely a gem."}
{"text":"Forget Mineo's. Forget Fiori's. Forget any other pizza joint in the south hills or Pittsburgh. They've got the best pizza in town. I grew up on the east coast where the water does something to the dough to make it second to none. These guys have figured out to work with Pittsburgh water to make the closest pizza dough to what you could get in NYC. 

Only disappoint would be that their menu is pretty limited. I would love to see what these guys could do with mozzarella sticks or other greasy sides of the like that go perfectly with killer pizza."}
{"text":"I am so sorry I stopped in and tried this place.. I thought it was strange when I went in that they had a huge industrial fan in the door blowing hot air and dust from the street into the shop. I asked if the air conditioning was broken, the girl said they don't have air conditioning.. Oh my it's 88 degrees today! I got my two slices of white and Sicilian pizza Togo. When I got home and opened the box in found human beard hairs on my white pizza.. Gross!! Then I remembered what the men making the pizza looked like. Homeless bearded men who were not happy to be in front of hot ovens.. The fan was drawing in cigarette smoke from the group of junkies that were sitting on the bench outside the front door talking and laughing loudly The reason I got my pizza to go in the first place..The health dept should make sure anyone cooking food should have covers over any facial hair, and pizza on display for sale covered from this filthy assault from the environment !! Please keep walking .. Down the street to the other pizza shops!"}
{"text":"What more can I say about this place that hasn't already been said? I'm the type of person who loves pizza, even BAD pizza, and there is plenty of both good and bad pizza to be found around the Mt. Lebanon area. Badamo is the good stuff. Lucky for me, I live within walking distance. It also helps that the owner, Anthony and his crew are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet. Congratulations to them on the expansion of the restaurant, and good luck. 
Strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wanted a BYOB place as we were in the mood for casual and affordable. Had a wonderful 1/2 white pizza and 1/2 red with sausage and mushroom on the whole pie.  Staff was very pleasant.  LOVED the large salad in a recycled paper efficient container.  Also have recycle bin in restaurant.  
Had a great night with our beer, pizza and salad and good service.  Can't beat that--good food and an awareness of the environment."}
{"text":"Just moved to Mount Lebanon and tried here today awesome pizza made in front of you. The staff was polite and very friendly. The best pizza I have ever eaten. I just finished working a 7 day week and didn't want to think. So I asked the staff to make a pizza with anything on it. They made me a pizza with onion, pepperoni, and cherry peppers. The combination was great. Everybody needs to eat here."}
{"text":"words couldn't express the joy of finally having pizza comparable to the shops in NYC here in Pittsburgh-- Mt Lebanon specifically. both Badamo's regular pie and Sicilian are worthy of praise. perfect sauce, perfectly baked dough/crust, excellent cheeses. the staff is super friendly and accommodating. the folks of South Hills are lucky to have such a transcendental pizza shop! looking forward to many more visits."}
{"text":"Took my family here.... 7,8, and 4 year old kids. Great pizza, great vibe, great staff. We were coming from ice rink a mile away and couldn't ask for a better post game meal. The salad was AMAZING!!!! All real food all good people."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and friendly customer service!  The prices could be a bit cheaper..."}
{"text":"Authentic and yummy. Friendly staff. Fast service and clean restaurant. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"This is great pizza.  I used to live within walking distance of this shop.  Now I go out of my way to get Anthony's pizza at least once a month.  Anthony takes pride in making his pizza fresh and with quality ingredients. Way better than Mineo's down the street.  Try the soups too.  Anthony's Mom makes great soups from scratch and his sister makes the cookies.  Its a family affair that is so great!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh by far.  Consistently great.  Very friendly staff.  If you like hot food try the cherry peppers on anything."}
{"text":"I'm going to buck the rave reviews trend here a little bit, because my experience has been really mixed.

I originally tried Badamo's because I was looking for a more affordable place than my go-to favorite, Vocelli's, and I liked Badamo's price range.  The pizza is simple, but tasty, and that's fine by me.

The problem I have is that orders get delivered incorrectly with a little too much frequency.  Which really isn't the end of the world, but I'm *really* nice when trying to sort out things like that, and so it bothers me when the customer service I get in response isn't also friendly.  

The last time I called about an incorrect order I was made to feel, with lots of frustrated sighing and prolonged silences, like it was my fault that they got my order wrong.  Even if it were my fault (it wasn't), that's just bad customer service.

If the pizza were super amazing, I'd probably shrug it off, but I don't feel like the quality is worth the hassle in this case, so I'll be on the hunt for new and awesome pizza in the South Hills!"}
{"text":"Great crust, good flavor, but too much cheese. The building is old fashion and vintage. There is lots of drink and food options."}
{"text":"I had a gift card for A'Pizza Badamo. I had never heard of the place before, which made me sad as a Mt. Lebanon resident. 
I enjoyed that their menu is so small - it makes it easier to choose and you know they have primo ingredients. I ordered a 16\" with sausage, spinach, and mushrooms. It was very delicious - fresh, hot, tasty. And delivered on time. No complaints from this girl :) I'll be ordering again, but probably with company over (the pizza was bigger than my fridge)."}
{"text":"Try this place out! Awesome staff and awesome pizza! Fresh and inexpensive that tastes great the next day. 

So glad I found this place! Best pizza in mount lebo. Cool vibes there man."}
{"text":"The steak sub was amazing, the prices were very reasonable, and delivery was free AND timely.  My only complaint was that there were no napkins or silverware (also ordered salad)."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best pizzas around! Really good if you like thin crispy crust. You can even get regular or Sicilian by the slice if you don't want a whole pie!

Their house salads are really good and reasonably priced. They have everything from chickpeas to olives in them. 

You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"They have AMAZING white pizzas and hoagies. That being said, I ordered the Specialty Staff Pie last night and it was not good. The description includes \"romano cheese\" - well, there was only about a teaspoon of cheese on the entire pizza. Not worth the specialty price. I will just stick to the white pizza and the Italian hoagies, that I know are exceptionally good."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite pizza in not only Mt. Leb, but Pittsburgh. The ingredients are fresh, the dough is perfection, and the sauce is just the right consistency and taste. (None if that sweet dreck you get other places). The staff is friendly and very attentive. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"No a/c in the place so my heart goes out to the owner and employees, but that make an amazing pizza!"}
{"text":"A pizza place is defined by their pizza, right? This place has the best tasting slices in the South Hills. The staff is friendly and the shop is inviting, but let's be honest... when you want pizza, you're looking for good pizza, right? This is the pie you want."}
{"text":"Really Good Pizza, Cool little shop. I wish there was a bathroom and that they served beer. I go for a slice pretty often, definitely highest quality ingredients and the dudes who work there are pretty cool to. Check it out for yourself but take your pizza home and enjoy a cold one with it."}
{"text":"Their delivery guy is awesome! He pulled up blaring the Misfits so we were like, \"yeaaaaaaaah\"
He had a Gwar t-shirt in and slightly resembled Jack Black in his mannerism.
The food was great but who cares, that delivery dude made our day!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here. Everything is delicious, every time! The wedding soup is wonderful and the pizza and subs are equally as good. I love the consistency and the friendly staff. Every single time we go here it's a great experience. Happy that they expanded. They sell pizza by the slice as well which is great if you just want something quick."}
{"text":"Good pizza and hoagies friendly service . A lot of variety of unique drinks you usually don't see elsewhere .. Clean atmosphere .. Would go back"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a chicken parm sandwich. Hot and tasty. Good atmosphere. Happy people."}
{"text":"The pizza from here never disappoints, I'd say best in the south hills! Im kind of picky about pizza & dislike chain pizza places, such as Pizza Hut or dominos. I wish I heard about this place sooner. Delivery is always quick too. I will be a life long customer as long as I'm living in Mt Lebanon. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Tried this place last night after wanting to try since reading other reviews, have to say I was very impressed with pizza and the breadsticks were amazing!!!
Staff was super friendly and just as we got in the car and realized we were missing the marina sauce for the bread sticks, the phone rang and it was the girl calling to say they forgot to give us our sauce! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Best (traditional) pizza in the South Hills. Relatively thin hand-tossed style crust. The \"staff pie\" is simply awesome (pepperoni, red onion, cherry peppers) and the \"wayno\" (garlic, anchovy, tomato) is also very good.
It's a takeout or delivery kind of place; you're not going to eat in the small area inside."}
{"text":"Super tasty, fast service - always fresh and delicious. This is our favorite pizza place in Mt. Leb!"}
{"text":"Pizza Badamo was excellent. Really enjoyed their margherita pizza and also sampled the kids' left-over pepperoni pizza. Staff was friendly and bathrooms were clean. Was our first visit here and we will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Another overrated PGH pizza place. 

Slices are puny with hardly any cheese, crust is not that great either.
Really came here to try slices of the Sicilian, but of course, they had zero made up and ready to put in the oven so that was a disappointment, I mean why there would be NO Sicilian pizzas made and waiting on Saturday afternoon is confusing.

Saw two grimy employees grabbing and handling raw and made pizzas with their foul bare hands. 
Nasty.

Nope. Never again."}
{"text":"We've been looking for pizza this good in Pittsburgh for a long time....it looks like we finally found it!  Fresh ingredients and a friendly staff make the over 25 mile 1 way drive worth the trip. ...will be back!"}
{"text":"This is what they call an $18 dollar Margherita Pizza. This place was great, until I ordered this, called in to tell them I wasn't satisfied with it and they argued with me about whether or not I knew what a Margherita Pizza
Looked like. Yes, I do and it isn't this."}
{"text":"I really didn't want to give a bad review because I liked this place when it opened and up until last couple months pizza was great but ordered lastnight . Waited 10 mins on hold and pizza was just plain bad. Sorry this is what happens when the owner doesn't make the pizzas and isn't there as much and hires young kids he thinks he trained so good the product won't change. Sorry just doesn't work like that!!!!"}
{"text":"This pizza is so yummy. The updated look is awesome and the environment is so chill. A place you will always want to go eat!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try A'Pizza Badamo ever since I saw it in an article of pizza places you've got to try in Pittsburgh. Definitely a memorable pie so I understand how it got itself on that list! 

Our favorite part of the pizza was the crust, being lovers of thin crust pizza. It was perfectly crispy at the edges. If that's not your forte, they also have Sicilian! The sauce is on the sweeter side, which sold me on first bite. They also offer pizza by the slice if you just want a snack or a taste of what they're about. Another plus: byob. 

Overall, I'm definitely a fan and will be ordering here  regularly; they also deliver!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood pizza joint, the service was great & very quick.  Prices were very reasonable. There is seating available but it's not a shutdown joint.  The white pizza was very good."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time trying A'Pizza Badamo and it won't be our last. We got delivery and they said it would be 45 mins to an hour. It got here after about 35-40 mins. Unfortunately, all of the cheese and toppings slid off of the majority of the pizza (only 3 pieces were left somewhat intact) during the drive. We didn't notice until the delivery driver was gone, so I called the shop. I was a waitress for 10 years, I get that stuff like this happens. It wasn't their fault. But still it sucks when you're hungry and about to leave for the night and your food is messed up. Anyway, when I called, they were very understanding and offered to make and send a new pizza. We had to be somewhere so we didn't have time to wait for them to send another, so they gave us a $15 credit for the next time we order!! Excellent customer service. As for the 3 slices we were able to eat, they were soo good! I read other reviews comparing it to Fiori's pizza. I see why people would think that..the crust is very similar but the sauce is not the same. It is still really good though! Can't wait to get it again."}
{"text":"When I first arrived, I was surprised to discover they didn't have pineapple as a topping. When I went to the manager to question the legitimacy of this \"restaurant\" I was pleasantly surprised to find out the reason. Its because the owner, Anthony Badamo, and all the food he makes is 100% Italian! **pineapple topping isn't Italian** The specials were fresh and scrumptious . The pizza by slice was delicious and piping hot. My personal recommendation, though?! The shrimp cocktail pizza, of course! 10/10 would eat again and again. Came for the pizza. Stayed for the shrimp! 

-Joe Bermingturkey"}
{"text":"Won't be going back. Disappointing pizza, too much sauce, not enough cheese, sauce reminds me of sauce in a jar. Crust was decent. The steak hoagie was bland for my taste buds, but the real deal breaker was the Italian hoagie, immediately after taking the first bite, I tasted scented lotion or perfume, I thought it must be my imagination so my boyfriend took a bite, he said unusual taste, maybe a sweet spice of some sort so he took another bite and agreed it was some perfume taste. Apparently, someone was handling the meat or condiments without gloves and left the scent, yuck for so many reasons..."}
{"text":"I've checked out a couple of the by-the-slice pizza places in Mt Lebanon, and this place is definitely a cut above. It just tastes just like a gorgeous New York slice, with large, gooey, pieces, the thinnest crust that has delicious bits of charring and big bubbles just like you expect. It folds beautifully. 

The other places in the area make fine pizza, but whatever they are doing here at Badamo's is the tops. And for the price you can't be beat - I got my whole dinner for $8 and change. 

One caveat: I would like them to offer pineapple as a topping. I really do love my Hawaiian pizzas and that crushed me when they told me that couldn't make it. But for real NYC pizza in Pittsburgh? I'll suffer. And keep asking for it. ;)"}
{"text":"Because pizza is one of my favorite foods, I've eaten tons of it all over the place.  NYC, Italy, California, etc. I know you may think this sounds a little weird but the pizza at A'Pizza Badamo is among the best I've ever eaten!  The crust is nice and thin but not dry; ingredients are fresh and the real thing; and the cheese and sauce blend together perfectly!  You won't find better pizza anywhere in Pittsburgh, or in most other cities.  You must try the white and red pizza because you'll probably like them both.  Sprinkle a little oregano on and you'll be in pizza heaven!  The staff is accommodating, the place is cozy, and the price is right!"}
{"text":"Their Sicilian pizza is to die for!  Everything there is great - from a plain ol' slice of cheese, to their unique and tasty salads (the beet salad is my favorite, no wait... the chicken salad, no... the tortellini salad... they're all wonderful!).  Also, the nicest bunch of people around.  Overall, a fabulous place to eat."}
{"text":"Just Go!

Order the Sicilian, whatever way you like it.  But, it is so good plain.  Alta Cucina tomatoes with great love in the sauce.  

Great selection of drinks from turners tea to quality bottled soda.  Pasta salads, fruit salad, and other cold sides look fantastic, but I haven't tried any of them.  

I'll be back"}
{"text":"Amazing as always! This time I even called them to tell then how good they are, love you guys! My friend and I were talking the other day and I discovered that he swears by the place just like I do! He told us to get the white pizza and meatball hoagie, we did, and it was GREAT. These giant meatballs HAVE to be homemade. We added sausage and spinach to the pizza. And we also had a salad, I'm pretty sure they make their own balsamic, looks homemade. The salad was mixed greens, chic peas, olives, onion, tomato, and parm."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the Burgh. I don't pike East End Pizza shops so the drive is totally worth it. The sauce and ingredients are totally unmatched."}
{"text":"Still very good, but there's a flaw:  they are crazy stingy with the toppings!

I don't reconnect getting more than one topping or you'll be disappointed.  Instead of four toppings, you get one mixed topping. 

This has happened over and over, as I have them the benefit of the doubt. I still love their food, but only get pepperoni now...

(Try their hot Italian hoagie, too. Excellent.)"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT pizza!!!  Everything was perfect - chewy crust, perfect amount of sauce and cheese.  Definitely my new favorite pizza!!"}
{"text":"Badamo edges out Slice on Broadway as the Best slice in the Pittsburgh area in my book. After 20 years of eating pizza in NYC, I thought Pittsburgh would disappoint... but alas, I was wrong!"}
{"text":"Pretentiously situated in Mount Lebanon.  We were really keen to try the Sicilian but they didn't have any prepared on a Saturday afternoon.  Fools.  Rather than get some prepared, the staff chose to slink around, smoke outside the front door, and frolic like what seemed to be hip-hop loving prepubescents.  We tried out a couple of slices, which weren't that big for the price.  

But I will say that if faced with the choice of Beto's, this place, or a Yinzer furry convention, I'd choose this place."}
{"text":"Pizza was fine.  The staff, not the owner, tries a little to hard to be hip and edgy.  That's fine for them when they're off work, but not interesting to be subjected too it as a customer.   They also seems to not be in tune with good food handling practices.  I've seen them grab cuts with their hands and put them in and pull them out of the oven.  Once the pizza is cooked, touching should be at a minimum."}
{"text":"Awesome service, short wait time, amazing pizza. 
Badamo is one of my favorite pizza places in the area hands down, the sauce and crust are unmatched by any competition around here. Slices are giant so take it one at a time, but at 1.75 a slice there's nothing to stop you from getting one too many lol. I got a slice of the white, plain, and then Sicilian as I couldn't choose just one. The pizza is heavenly, the staff is awesome, and the environment of the restaurant is so laid back that it feels like you're at home. Great place and great service."}
{"text":"Really good pizza, but I definitely don't agree with some of the reviews saying it's the best pizza in Pittsburgh. There's still a few pizza places around the city that have A'Pizza Badamo beat. 
Ordered a medium, pizza was pretty big for a medium. Just the right amount of cheese and sauce, wasn't too greasy. 
Great flavor! Will definitely order from A'Pizza Badamo again!"}
{"text":"Tough to say who has the best pizza in the burgh with so many outstandingly awesome places, but this is one of them or maybe even the one.  The crust, sauce and cheese are perfect IMO, superior ingredients prepared perfectly."}
{"text":"Finally - NY Style Pie :)

There are no coal fire ovens.    They do serve single slices of pizza.    The pizza passes my stand test.   

2 Slices of pizza (covered my paper plate) for around $6.   You can select your toppings - they will top their base pizza.

Awesome place for a quick slice while you are out at the bars waiting on Uber Cab :)"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area. The people who work at the shop are all really cool. The owner is always good for a friendly nod. By far the best pizza in Lebo. But don't tell that to the older folks in town. They will freak out and say that it's Mineos (Badamo way better).  Seriously you'll start an argument."}
{"text":"I eat this pizza everyday of my life and I never get sick of it! Awesome environment and great service!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in  the area. We moved here 2 years ago and have been on a quest looking for a good/great pizza. Two months ago we found it! It is just crisp enough, not greasy, The pizza was perfect having bacon, fresh tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, and banana peppers. The only negative is it's a pain to park, I park behind the building and walk. The delivery is good but takes 60-90 minutes
Little interior seating, mainly it is to go."}
{"text":"This used to be our go-to pizza delivery, but lately it's just not as good.  Last time the pizza was a bit underdone and it took FOREVER to be delivered.  So, we gave up and eventually went back to Bado's.  I'm guessing during off-peak times, it's still okay.  But be warned if you try to order during dinner time on a Friday night..."}
{"text":"Great pizza place to grab a quick bite.  I really like that you can just order by the slice here.  The ingredients are all very fresh here and make for a great piece of pizza.  It is very thin crust, but the good dough helps it hold up.  They also have some really good house made ranch that goes well with the pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is really good. Clean. The cashier is kind of snotty. Typical for this area. I never eat in but take out. Music is loud dance with irritating rhymes.
Will return for takeout only."}
{"text":"Simply the best pizza available in mt lebanon.  What do you want? They will put it on there for you, and some how not make a mess of it.... its a nice change to a market used to mass production.  I dont order fron any other place now. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Not sure what's going on here, but it seems to me that the entire staff is on an unlimited morphine drip...so damn friendly.

I write this review after ordering a pizza and a hoagie...took me three calls to get thru as they're probably very busy on a cold Saturday night, but still, the person was chipper than I get when I'm petting my kitty cat. I sleep well each night I eat A'Pizza because I know the chances are slim that my pizza was tainted by a disgruntled worker.

...and last but not least the pizza is excellent (I recommend the roasted tomato and spinach pizza pictured here in yelp) and the hoagies are delish - crunchy Italian bread with all the good stuff inside. The Mrs. always enjoys dippin' her pie in their delicious, home-made ranch dressing.

Good stuff. 

:)"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. The pizza is DELICIOUS  with a crispy yet chewy crust... and reasonably priced. It reheats beautifully as well. Make sure you try the Sicilian. Friendly staff too! This is my new favorite!"}
{"text":"I never used to be crazy about pizza until Darren started dragging me to all these pizza places in the P-G-H. A'Pizza Badamo is another reason I'm learning to dig pizza.  The sausage and egg pizza we brought home a few weeks ago was excellent, but unlike Darren, I didn't mind the egg (we probably should have ate it there). Really, really good. Shame they don't deliver to The Beech. lol."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pizza! I decided right away that their white pizza was the best I have ever had. And then I tried the red sauce, which is also amazing! I can never decide on which to get, so I usually get a slice of each. 

Not only are the sauces amazing, but the crust is perfect. I find myself making special trips to Mt. Lebo just to grab a slice. Pass by Mineos and try Badamos. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian hoagie and I paired it with a trio of fresh pasta salads. Love that this cafe is BYOB. I enjoyed a bottle of beer along with my meal. The staff was very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Staying at the Springhill Suites, ordering was fast and simple. Pizza arrived within 30 minutes, hot and cheesy. 
Pizza is a subjective taste and I truly enjoyed this pie. Cheesy, a good sauce with a thin moist bottom crust. It hot the spot."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a huge pizza fan, but my boyfriend is....he had seen a review on Reddit and had to try some.  We ordered about 3 slices to share:  pepperoni, cheese, and white pizza.  The staff was very nice in answering questions and recommending things.  All the slices were super delicious, but I have to say I'm partial to the white pizza.  It tasted like a buttery, cheesy, garlicky breadstick.  We were back the next day for a whole white pizza with spinach and sausage.  Omg, it was heaven in my mouth.  A must try if you're a pizza fan!"}
{"text":"Another example of \"south hills\" food. Burnt the crap out of my hoagie and whoever was in charge still let that food go out for delivery. Pizza undercooked, hoagie burnt."}
{"text":"My new second favorite (Fioris fan since a kid).  Took me too long to try this place.  Went with a plain cheese pie, and it was delicious.  Great char and chew to the crust.  Not a sweet sauce, I'm cool wit that.  It was excellent, will be back soon."}
{"text":"I ate here last night with my girlfriend and another dining companion for dinner.  When looking at the website earlier in the day we noticed that this was a BYOB place and so we brought along a bottle of wine.  The shop itself is not much to look at as it looks like your normal pizza shop with 4 tables and a cooler set up inside.  You could tell it was popular though as the tables were almost always full of customers and there was a large amount of foot traffic coming both in and out while we ate our dinner.

After we all arrived and checked out the chalkboard menu, we decided to order both an 18\" red pizza and also a 16\" white pizza to split amongst the three of us.  We also mentioned that we had a bottle of wine when ordering and after a little bit of a search, they provided us with a corkscrew and some small glasses.  You could tell that people do not bring wine here that often but with no corkage fee, I don't see why you wouldn't.  After a short wait they served us the pizza right out of the oven and it both looked and smelled great whenever it was put on out table.  The red cheese pizza was nice with a good amount of cheese and sauce through which you could taste the mozzarella.  The crust was also done perfectly as it was thin and crispy but not burnt at all.  I also thought that the white pizza was good even though I did not eat much of it.  It came with the regular cheese interspersed with globs of ricotta on top, a nice oil (maybe garlic too?) based sauce and tomatoes under the cheese.  Both of my dining companions liked the white pizza even more than the red pizza.  I also thought that the workers of the shop were exceptionally pleasant during our whole meal.  They were especially accommodating to what we needed and asked multiple times if there was anything else that we wanted.  It was something that I was not prepared for at a small pizza shop but I am glad that I can write about it.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely eat here again.  The pizza was excellent and the workers friendly so I imagine that I would stop by for a slice in the future whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"Living in Dormont, there are so many delicious pizza places to satisfy any craving you may have. From square pizza with cold cheese at Beto's to greasy pizza that hits the spot after a night of drinking or day of sobriety at Fiori's. One thing Dormont has lacked is access to great pizza that you can have delivered to your door. A'Pizza Badamo makes a great pie and delivers. The menu is simple, which is great when you don't want to spend an hour choosing between 1,000 toppings. The small menu also has the added benefit of everything being delicious. So many pizza joint prescribe to the adage of \"jack of all trades, master of none.\" Nothing on this menu is bad. The meatball and steak hoagies are so good. Plus it is the only place I would order wedding soup knowing that it was made right and cooked with love. Going there is also great. I love ordering a full pizza but I am actually partial to their slices. They get so crispy and delicious when they are heated up in the oven. Oh my!"}
{"text":"I am a pizza snob and only like a few places. This is definitely one of them. A thin crispy crust highlights their pizza. I've only bought it by the slice to eat-in the shop. It's mouth-watering! I love the white pizza especially. They have nice employees, and a clean shop with a some tables to eat at. They also have a selection of salads and sweets. I've never tried but it all looks good. I'm too busy eating the pizza to try anything else."}
{"text":"I got the eggplant hoagie and a pepperoni pizza $27.  The eggplant hoagie comes wrapped in butcher paper.  I thought I was in for a tasty crispy eggplant sandwhich.  Not!  It was slimy!  I like my eggplant, zucchini, and okra fried with a crispy cornmeal coating.  The sauce is salty and does not compliment the eggplant.  The bread was toasted and that was the ONLY crunchy part.  I had a sweater full of crumbs.  The cheese is thick and goey.  I liked the cheese, but, No Way would I order the eggplant sandwhich again.  I give it a (1).

The pizza is not bad.  I give it a (3).  It is better than Mineo's.  The crust is tough.  The sauce is that same salty sauce used on the eggplant, but it plays better on pizza.  The cheese was plentiful, thick, and goey.  They don't skimp on the cheese.  I like the chese.  I'm picking at it while I write this review.  The pepperoni pieces are small so that helps when biting.  It tastes like Hormel out of a package.  

The shop is SO hot and humid in July.  I recommend you take a 15\" walk and come back when your pizza is ready.  I feel sorry for the staff that has to stand on top of a hot oven all day.  They were very friendly though.

I STRONGLY recommend you go in the public parking lot across the street to park $1.50.  The meter men make a killing up and down W.Liberty/Washington Ave.  The parking lot is full too.  I had to park on the 3rd floor."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Came here on a walk through Lebo to grab a quick slice. The cheese was SO greasy and burnt. The crust was literally non existent (which is my favorite part). The ranch is home made, but just tasted like a Dill Dip to me. I do like that you can just purchase a slice rather than a whole Pizza, but other than that there is no reason to return."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza shop in Mt Lebanon and possibly Pittsburgh. Great vibe and great staff. A worthy addition to Uptowns great mix of dining options. Henry also make a mean eggplant parm!"}
{"text":"I just moved to mount Lebanon and I have to say that if I could I would eat here every day! They have drinks that you don't see everywhere like grape soda turner's ice tea and turners blend. But the pizza is the best I have ever had! It's quick, made fresh, and is worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Great pizza 
Classic pizzeria atmosphere
Great location 
Pizza by the slice is amazing 
Good service and better food"}
{"text":"These guys do pizza the right way. Perfect New York style and everything here reminds me of home. Any pie you get you will not be disappointed, this is a weekly stop for me."}
{"text":"I always enjoyed their pepperoni pizza. A great place to eat during the late summer day."}
{"text":"We order take out from here probably at least once a week - the pizza is great for think crust lovers (but more on the gourmet side, this isn't Pizza Hut). From my observation, they use really quality ingredients. Other options we've enjoyed are the hoagies, salads (fairly simple options - good house dressing) and calzones. Very nice local option!"}
{"text":"It has the traditional crust and sauce. I usually buy it buy the slice for a really good deal of less than $2. This is one of better slices of pizza you will have in the city of Pizzaburgh.."}
{"text":"The weekend before last, after watching \"Welcome Back Kotter\" on DVD from Netflix (the show holds up very well) on a Saturday afternoon, Kay decided that she desired pizza. I obliged only on the condition that the pizza parlor would be a fresh Yelp, meaning I hadn't reviewed them before. Kay added a stipulation: It must be close. 

So to Mt. Lebanon's other \"bad-ass\" (see Bado's) pizza parlor we drove. 

I would advise thee not to be so foolish as to order egg on a pizza from A'Pizza Badamo to take home. Due to the over-easy nature of the egg itself and its position in the center of the pie, the staff will not slice it. That task was left to us when we arrived back at the house, and with no pizza cutter handy, well, things got messy fast. 

However, this was a smashingly good pizza with crust heavy on the char and chew, bitchingly rich mozzarella, a fresh, almost salsa-like sauce, and sausage niblets that were succulent and oily. 

Also brought back to the ranch was a half a meatball hoagie that was filled with mammoth softball-proportioned rounds of ground meat and parsely. I took one bite, quickly analyzed that these were some of the very best meatballs ever to be laid inside a hoagie bun with red sauce and mozzarella, and downed the remainder in record time. Hall of Fame material it was, guys. 

And speaking of guys, the fellows that minded the store were so engaging, I regretted not dining-in so that I could chat with them. Perhaps next time. 

A'Pizza Badamo is the type of casual, cheap, barebones joint one wouldn't expect to see in Mt. Lebanon, and that's just one of a few feathers they have in their cap. 

May their \"baaad\" reputation bring them much business and accolades...

Come down to the Badlands why don't you? Whether it's A'Pizza Badamo or Bado's, I'd wager you can't lose either way the coin falls.

P.S. I'm not a big Jacko fan, so...no."}
{"text":"It has been a while and we ordered a whole pizza via phone.  Told 45 to 60 minutes.  Arrived at 60 minutes and was told in a nasty tone that is was 45 to 60 minutes and our pizza would be at least 15 more minutes....was not even made yet....ummmmmmm!!!!!  OK, just be nice. No reason to be mean.  There seemed to be a large staff with two guys making pizza and some delivery, but I guess they were busier than it looked during my wait. 
The pizza was OK, the sauce and cheese were good but the crust was very dry and hard...so many pizza places to go back to...probably not here for awhile!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza around.  Will pay extra for the quality.  However, for the love of God, please get a soda fountain.  And they have somehow reconfigured the interior, but there is still no place to sit."}
{"text":"Not a complaint per se more of an observation but they really need a better phone ordering system - the whole jumping between calls while ordering and being put on hold when you call in is so 1979 already.  Online ordering would be a big plus.  Still our favorite pizza shop."}
{"text":"If you're looking for New York style pizza in Pittsburgh, get it here. The crust is thin and the slices are big. I guess I'm just not a huge fan of the style, I do like it a little thicker. The crust was chewy and a little dry."}
{"text":"Pizza the way it is supposed to be done!  A little charring, and crispy, yet chewy, crust.  The sauce strikes the perfect balance of sweetness (not too much), and FRESH toppings!  In my opinion this is top 3 pizza joints in Pittsburgh... Try it!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here after picking up some Zeke's coffee at Betsy's ice cream to check out their pizza. They serve other things besides pizza including hoagies, salads and on top of the ordering counter an array of delicious cookies.

I asked which were the most popular and was told either the white pizza or the Sicilian. I opted for the latter since it had a thick crust. I had my slice in no time flat and it was delicious! I asked later about their toppings and was told they are for their regular pizzas only. Course this one with the tomato base stood out among itself. Had a bit of a sweeter sauce which I thoroughly enjoyed. To be honest it really didn't need any topping. Take out and delivery are  available and they have a refrigerator for beverages. It's not often I find pizza by the slice but was well pleased with my choice.

Prices are very reasonable. Again if you are parking in the Mt. Lebanon garage, I learned they don't validate. Still it is definitely worth a return visit to try out the white one. Found out it is made with a different cheese and drenched in olive oil. Sounds good!"}
{"text":"The Italian hoagie was pretty good, but not the best. The place was hotter than h*ll, so not a good atmosphere to dine in. Also, it drives me nuts when restaurants charge for cheap extras on a hoagie.... for a 9$ hoagie, you should be able to throw in a couple of hot pepper rings..."}
{"text":"Visiting from Maryland and originally from New Jersey so I have high standards for pizza/Italian.  I was not disappointed. We got take out.  Staff was remarkable and friendly.  Pizza and my steak calzone were ridiculous.  The calzone can probably feed 3.

I can't wait to return to Pittsburgh to try the other offerings."}
{"text":"As a former resident of the area I miss getting to come here on a whim. However luckily for me my dermatologist is a quick walk away and this is always part of my visit. I love the thin pizza as well as the Sicilian. Seriously love them equally and have to spend several minutes deciding on style alone. Then of course it's time to choose toppings. So my new thing is just to order by the slice. This gives me the best of both worlds. And the toppings? Extra cheese is my go-to."}
{"text":"Having moved from New York I was concerned about the quality of pizza I would find. This place is not too far off in terms of quality of pizza. Their meatball hogies are excellent as well."}
{"text":"A'pizza Badamo is a fairly hip little pizza shop with a small dining room.  You can tell someone under 40 owns the place and the atmosphere is a bit of a refreshing vibe from your traditional dirty old trite Italian pizza joint.  The staff is young and they actually seem to be having a pretty good time.  They have a really nice selection of heady soda too which is nice.  

I called in to order the pie and I asked the girl how big their pizzas were.  She told me that they have a 10 cut and a 12 cut which is a big pet peeve of mine because number of cuts means absolutely nothing.  I considered cutting a dollar bill into 16 and trying to use it to pay for the pie but I figured it would go over her head.  I ordered the large (which is 18 INCHES by the way).  Also you kind of have to question the judgement of a pizzeria that would actually CHOOSE to have to cut a pizza into 10 slices, which is quite annoying for the person cutting it. 

So as for the pizza, it's very close to being awesome but its just slightly lacking on all fronts just enough to make me desire a little more.  

Badamo is using regular deck brick ovens and they are keeping them nice and hot, the pie was perfectly cooked with a nice medium brown bottom and beautiful tan crust.  They are cooking the pie directly on the brick without screens which is awesome but the pie itself is definitely very imperfect as far as shape goes.  The pizza man wasn't able to get the pie of the peel and keep it perfectly round so the result was this sort of circle/square hybrid pizza.  Luckily the issue with the shape is purely cosmetic though and the pizza is still made well with a consistently thick bottom and no issues of any spots being too thin.  The pizza was on the doughy side, I think it may have been really fresh dough that didn't quite have time to bloom yet because it lacked the air that it needed to become totally crispy.  The taste of the dough itself is delicious, it has a very nice fermented taste that is unique to others I have found in the city.  I think on the right day if their dough has enough time to proof that it has the potential to be really really excellent.  Unfortunately for this pie the airy crispy factor wasn't totally there, but it was very close to being great.  

The cheese is a high quality cheese and it is distributed well across the pie.  It was a little heavy on the cheese for my tastes but still not overkill by any means.  Cheese does seem to be driving the flavor car on this pizza, with crust in the back and sauce tucked away sadly in the trunk.

The sauce was super skimpy.  There wasn't really enough sauce on the pie to even fully assess but I think if it were more prevalent that it probably would have been pretty good.  It seems to have a medium watery thickness but still with some decent tomatoes.  Real basil leaves in the sauce are nice.  There is nothing overkill or offensive about the sauce (which is almost rare around here) and in general it seems fine.  I wish that I had more of it, I bet its probably good.


In general A'pizza Badamo is a pretty good pizza and you can tell that they take extreme pride in their work.  If they were to tone down the cheese, turn up the sauce and let the dough ride enough than I think they could be making one of the best pies in the city.  This place shows lots of potential though, I would recommend it.  

I'm giving it a solid 7/10."}
{"text":"One hour and 45 minutes after ordering on a Tuesday night, our two large pizzas have not arrived and we cancelled. We live a literal five minutes from the store. Two thumbs way down!"}
{"text":"I am bias. Doesn't compare to NYC.  Nice effort."}
{"text":"This pizza port wins the award for biggest pizza box and blandest taste.  It's New York-style, I get it...but, not sure what all the hype is about?  Perhaps throw another topping or two on the pie, but there are a few other spots in town to check out first before returning here."}
