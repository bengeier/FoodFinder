{"text":"Fantastic place. So happy we chose it for our kids first truly fine dining experience: it offers highest quality nuanced food and great atmosphere and at the same time accommodates guests with kids well. Excellent service too! Recommend."}
{"text":"This review pertains strictly to the quality of the photos of food I've seen. They're literally making want to stop everything and go directly there to taste. Plated the way plating should be done and fit for a Chef's table.  I will be there asap. Hmm, perhaps I can get them to deliver to my desk. Will be back with some tasting feedback soon. Great name - by the way."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. It's more of an experience than a restaurant, really. The service was 11/10. The plating was so beautiful I didn't even want to eat it (but I did). I have to say my favorite part was the appetizer of scallops, taste-wise. And plating/experience wise, the dessert was amazing. The chef herself (YAY for a female chef!) came by the table and plated the dessert in front of our eyes. Wow wow wow. I was sad that it was empty when it went because I want them to do well, but it was also kind of nice because we had the place to ourselves. Go on a weekday if you want a nice, private experience!"}
{"text":"Myself and my family thoroughly enjoyed the meal. The meal starts after ordering with the menu being spayed with tomato juice and then eating it. The kids loved eating the menu.  We did the tasting course where choose the appetizers and main course and the build courses around it. All of the courses were both tasty and interest. The meal ended with the chef creating the attached desert with twelve items. Very happy with the food and the experience."}
